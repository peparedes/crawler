I'm nearly always on IRC (exceptions being for power/internet failure). If I'm on as one of my characters (Momoko, Nagi, Yousuke), I'm at the computer and can hear pings. If I have an away nick up that says something like ""Momo|(animetitlegoeshere)"", I'm at the computer and can hear your pings. If I have ""MomoSleepie"" or ""MomoNap"" up, I'm asleep and cannot be reached at the moment. If I have ""MomoPizza"" or ""MomoThaHD"" up, I'm at one of my jobs and won't be reachable for a few hours. Since I only work one job a day, whenever I get back from that job, I'm free.

If I disappear from IRC for several days, you can reach my boyfriend either at <lj user=""asakura_akio""> or on http://www.violetandgold.com/psu. I can always be reached at sailorN1@aol.com as long as I'm in posession of a computer, and am pretty prompt at replying to e-mails. I am generally online between 4pm and 10pm, depending on when I get off work. If I have MomoPizza as my away nick in IRC, I'll be on at 9pm. And then I'm generally on all night. :3

"event","As mentioned a couple of weeks ago, here we have a special section where you can send 'anonymous' letters to characters in camp (or camp in general).

Please try to keep things above-board, not-too-serious, and fun! I'd also ask that the questions be stuff that you wouldn't normally get a chance to heckle a character about during the course of a regular thread. If a question will need a specific character to answer it, expect it to be run by the player first. If your character is asked a question, I'll try to work out a time for me to post it so that you're online and can join the thread. Otherwise, I'll be going in order. I'll try to at least get two a week, if not more (if we have that many).

When making your comment, please leave a name at the bottom, so that it can be easily c/p'd into a post. Stuff that you'd see in Dear Abby is what I'm aiming for here - <i>'concerned in Detroit', 'Grandpa Stranger'</i> (actually saw this one the other day, no kidding), etc, etc.

If there are any actual questions or concerns, I'll be handling them in the CFO post (and probably ammending this to go with it., whee)."

So between Sano-kun, Umeda-sensei, and whoever 'James' is, who do you think is most suspicious? I'm leaning towards Sano-kun myself, since the first thing he said to me was that if I was a wolf this time, he'd catch me for sure, but... everyone knows that the odds of getting picked twice in a row are pretty steep <s>unless you're Riddle, what was he, a wolf every damn time?</s>.

"event","Since this came up in the voting posts, and it's kind of a hard issue to address in an app (if not almost completely impossible), Yousuke and I decided that the best thing to do about 'what has been happening in Momoko's world while she's been away' would be for me to put our thoughts on it down in a post. 

At this point, <i>anyone</i> apping from Wedding Peach would have this problem - as I posted <a href=""http://angelamourpeach.livejournal.com/4845.html"">here</a> back in August, Momoko leaving her world and staying gone for an extended period of time (or permanantly) would royally fuck her world over. And really, I don't think the fact that she's spent nine and a half months alone in camp should be cause to penalize anyone else apping from her series. So hopefully, this post will fix that.

When apping a Wedding Peach character, to get around Momoko's absence, one would either have to: 1) app from the same part of the series as her (or earlier), 2) ignore Momoko's absence and app from later in the series as though nothing had ever happened, or 3) app some weird, fucked up AU version of the character in which Momoko never came home and her world is now run by demons.

The problem with option 1 is that, basically, this cuts the appable cast IN HALF - you can get away with this with Yuri, Hinagiku, and Jama-P and that's about it. The remainder of the cast are either significantly different from anywhere you'd want to app them (I can see the same problem Yousuke's having with Yanagiba, truthfully) or just NOT PRESENT at the time Momoko left (Salvia, Takuro, and any of the demons are good examples of this).

Option 1 presents a very special problem for Yousuke considering that he doesn't discover his true nature until much, much later in the series. Which means, you guessed it, <i>camp would trigger his transformation at some point</i>. Yousuke and I both agree that, while it would be a lot of fun to demolish camp in a fit of rage, it's really not something anyone would want to deal with as far as a permanent character is concerned. Aside from massive property damage, it would also bring in a TON OF ANGST, which I am personally sick to fucking death of playing with, thx.

Option 3 is also a very special problem for Yousuke, considering that if Momoko really <i>were</i> to be gone for nine or ten months, her world would basically be fucked. And Yousuke would be the one doing the fucking (and he wouldn't use lube, either. Bitches). And while fanfics are fun and all, I'd really not advise anyone to app an AU fanfic version of their character, which is what Yousuke would have to be in order to say Momoko just never came back.

So, as odd as it seems, the best solution for all involved is 2 - just say nothing has changed and life went on as normal. To this end, we're just going to say that Momoko came back from camp two weeks after she left and remembers it as a normal summer camp. If she said anything about it, it'd probably be along the lines of ""It was lots of fun! We did arts and crafts! Oh, and don't go near the lake! I don't remember why, just... don't go near the lake!""

Hope that helps clear some of the confusion up!"

"event","As you may or may not have noticed, Momoko's use of honorifics doesn't always adhere to what we're taught of the traditional Japanese language and naming structure. So for those of you who've wondered why she calls you what she does, here ya go.

-san: Momoko only uses this in cases where the person being referred to is either clearly much older than her (such as a counselor without any real authority, like Atsuko-san, or an authority figure like Huang-san) or the person is still relatively new to her. You'll also notice that she uses the given name of almost everyone she meets (Ying is a special case, since she conciously switched to using her family name in order to be more polite to her. She is also unaware of Tsuzuki's given name, if I remember correctly) - she does this in canon, too, to total strangers (Susumu-san and Mimiko-san in episode three come to mind immediately).

It should also be noted that -san is a term of respect - you should never *ask* to be referred to with this honorific, because really, what <i>have</i> you done to <i>deserve</i> it? (It would be for this reason that neither Kazahaya nor Rikuou will <i>ever</i> have this honorific used on them by Momoko)

-chan, -kun: Momoko's general honorific for classmates that she's not close-close to, which would be... most of the camp, actually. She will generally move very quickly from -san to -kun/-chan with most campers closer to her own age - I think she actually went from -san to -kun for Sorata in roughly the space of two comments.

-sama: I believe there's only been one case of Momoko using this on anyone in camp, and that was on Boyan (and Zhuge Liang, but he's never really here, so... Oh, and on Bofu, because he's the Emperor and stuff... and Zhou Yu-sama... okay, more than one case). And in canon, she only uses it for Limone-sama, Aphrodite-sama, and Yanagiba-sama. So basically, if you manage to awe her enough, or are indeed royalty or divinity, she will use this on you (and technically, because I like to use as little actual Japanese as possible, she really *is* calling Boyan 'oniisama' - I just... translate it out to 'Big Brother' instead. What).

-sensei: Used for most counselors (the only real exceptions are for counselors that just don't seem to have positions, like D, Lupin, and Atsuko, although I think Lupin is ""Lupin-sensei"" anyway, because it's funny). Pretty self-explanitory.

-chama: Not actually used by Momoko, but worth noting anyway because, while it doesn't show up in the dub, Jama-P actually does refer to Momoko as Momoko-chama/Peach-chama (and to Yousuke as Yousuke-chama and Viento-chama). This is a less-common suffix and means 'Young Lord' or 'Young Lady' - like a junior version of -sama. And I think it's cute. STFU.

None: If Momoko doesn't use a suffix with you at all, it's for one of three reasons: she either really likes you and puts you in the same category as Yuri and Hinagiku (Shinn, Kira, Heather, Cher), you asked (Heather, Buffy), or you just somehow managed to piss her off so badly that she dropped it (Dearka, Kazahaya). In canon, there are only two types of people that Momoko (and her friends) doesn't use suffixes on - those they're closest with (like... Yuri and Hinagiku) and those that really just piss them off (Kawanami Hiromi springs to mind, as does the way Momoko never once attaches a suffix to Yousuke's name throughout the entire series, even when he starts out pissing her off).

Generally, Momoko will go for a first or given name over a last name when speaking to someone (unless she's *trying* to be polite). The only real exceptions are, well... people who intimdate her (like Ying and... uhh... I can't think of anyone that intimidating off the top of my head right now) and people whose naming conventions she doesn't know (like the Chinese, who she'll ususally either call by their full name or by their style name, depending upon which is easier to pronounce/remember).

I have heard that in the past decade or so that there has been a movement among Japanese youth towards more relaxed practices regarding the use of honorifics and naming conventions, and it seems to bear out with Momoko's canon (and her personality wtf). You can also catch this in Tsubasa, which I think was the first place I saw it pointed out, although I had picked up a bit of it from observing Momoko's speech and naming patterns.

And if this doesn't make much sense, stfu, I'm tired."

After a long day of cooking and cleaning the defense base, she'd decided to come and take a soak in the onsen. And even better - since she'd worked through the night and it was still early in the morning, the onsen was deserted. This meant she could strip completely without having to worry about being seen.

As Momoko took the bright yellow bows out of her hair she began to think again, and this was never really a good thing. What had all that cooking and cleaning been for, anyway? Well, Big Brother, of course, and the other people there, but it really wasn't the same as cooking for one special person in particular.

Wrapping a towel around herself, Momoko stepped toward the water."

You may have noticed (or may not have, who knows?) that Momoko has managed to basically screw herself over big-time by falling in love with quite possibly the most ill-fated general in Ancient China. Here's a breakdown of just exactly *how* bad Momoko has managed to bone herself (and possibly her entire world).

<lj-cut text=""The nastiness of which Momoko is aware""><b>Options of which Momoko is aware</b>

<i>Option 1: Go to Ancient China</i>

This option lets Momoko stay with Boyue, but she basically knows that, well, she's fucked if she does. She knows she has no clue how to act, she'll probably be ridiculed for at least a good while because of her hair (among other things), and that she's going to have to cope with being away from Boyue for long periods of time. There may also be some language difficulty. 

She also knows that he'll die at age 59 in a horrible, gruesome manner. Which would mean that she would die at 53 with their two daughters, were she to become his wife. For some reason, this actually gives Momoko a little piece of mind - she wouldn't have to worry about wondering if he'd come back everytime he went off to war. And the dying part doesn't scare her, probably because it's <i>forty years from now</i>. Also, to her mind, it's better than being a widow (she at least won't be one for long!).

<i>Option 2: Return to Hanazono-ga-Oka</i>

Yeah, hi, super-bonage. If Momoko were to do this, she'd be an emotional wreck. First of all, she'd have to live with the knowledge that Boyue was 1) dead, 2) married to someone else, and 3) had died without her there. And considering the circumstances, it's highly unlikely that she'd leave her bed for at least a week, possibly more. 

Were she to keep her memories of Boyue, it would be highly unlikely that she'd be able to attend school regularly (or concentrate if she did), have real conversations with her friends (for at least a long period of time, probably in the months), or fall in love again (for a very, very long time). Needless to say, since her powers come from the energy of love, she would probably be unable to even transform into her Love Angel self (if she even managed the wedding dress transformation, she'd never be able to make it into her Fighter Angel form). And Yousuke is probably right out.

Momoko knows all of the above with some degree of certainty. She also realizes that if all of this were the case, Aphrodite *would* remove her memories of Boyue (possibly leaving the rest of her memories about camp intact, as that seems to be the way these things work in WP). This is probably what scares Momoko the most about going back home - she doesn't want her memories taken away, but she knows they'll have to be.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Things of which Momoko is unaware""><b>Things of which Momoko is unaware</b>

The following is all dependent entirely on whether time flows alongside camp time or not. Also, it hinges on the assumption that Daisy and Lily have been able to successfully route all the demons they've faced up until now. Otherwise, this goes out the window.

Momoko's only got a limited window in camp for which she can safely return to her world without ramifications. Were she to return <i>today</i> (that is, before September 1st), she could probably be okay (with memory modification). This is because Momoko's story takes place over the course of a year - nothing really happens in summer, other than the Love Angels acquiring the Saint Something Four (of which Momoko's ring is already in her possession, so this is kind of negated). Each portion of time after that carries its own risks.

<i>Fall</i>

From roughly September 1st to October 31st, the girls are pursued by Ignis, who is inhabiting Takuro's body. Were Momoko to return sometime in this time period, she might be alright. However, because Takuro pursues her, there might be some nasty interactions with Aphrodite's memory modification. Takuro, for those unfamiliar with him, is basically a wimpy genius who gets granted super-human abilities by a demon. In appearance, he's similar to Ishida - but also sort of similar to Boyue, too. 

In other words, when he tries to kiss her (which he does. Often), it's going to fuck hardcore with Momoko's mind (Aphrodite's memory erasals don't hold in some cases). She'll probably require at least one extra memory wipe. Whoops.

<i>Winter</i>

Potamos strikes in winter (starting on Halloween). There's a very real danger in this time period of Potamos getting ahold of Yousuke and turning him into his demon self or else possibly seducing him.

If Momoko returned too late in this time frame (especially without being around in the Fall, which is actually pretty important to her romantic development with Yousuke), she would stand to not only lose Yousuke to Potamos, but also to get her ass pwned by Viento at some point. Whoops again.

<i>Early Spring</i>

The big one. If Momoko returns sometime between Christmas and her birthday next year, she's boned. Bottom line. 

This is when Viento comes out. Aside from being ridiculously strong (he can take out all the Love Angels if he so wishes - the only thing that stops him is, well, Momoko appealing to his human side), he's not going to have Momoko's love to keep him anchored. Even if Momoko comes back right around Christmas, it still won't be time enough for her to build a real relationship with him - Reine Devilla will get him.

And if Momoko's not there when he first faces the other three Love Angels (assuming Salvia's come out on schedule), their first fight will pretty well be their last. He can and will kill them. There's pretty much no getting around it.

So really, Momoko's got until around the middle of January to get back home before it gets totally FUBAR. And even then, if she gets there too close to the end, she's only going to go down with everyone else. She better just hope the demons like pink-haired serving wenches, I guess.</lj-cut>

So, in summary...

It's fucked, basically."

"event","Going in alphabetical order, because I suck like that:

<lj-cut text=""Long List o' Relationships"">- Wednesday Addams: Frightens Momoko, obviously. Not as badly as Tetora does, probably because Momoko's had at least one non-threatening conversation with Wednesday, but still enough that Momoko knows to steer clear of her (that takes a lot, by the way). 

- *Anne Shirley: Momoko adores Anne and considers her one of her best friends in camp. She greatly enjoys the conversations she gets to have with Anne, because they really agree on a lot.

- Artemis Fowl II: Momoko doesn't know him very well. The few times they've spoken, he's been sort of condescending to her. She has a semi-decent impression of him because of his time with Lina, though.

- Aang: I don't believe Momoko's met Aang.

- Prince Zuko: I don't believe Momoko's met Zuko, or if they have they didn't speak long enough for Momoko to get a solid impression of him.

- Sokka: Momoko likes Sokka, but never gets to see him. Awww.

- Ted 'Theodore' Logan: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Bill S. Preston, Esq: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Arisawa Tatsuki: Momoko's not talked to her enough to get a solid impression of her.

- Hitsugaya Toushirou: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him (outside of ""That guy that made everything cold that one time"")

- Honshou Chizuru: Momoko likes Chizuru, as long as she's not groping her (which is most of the time now). Thinks she's a little strange, but then again, she doesn't really understand all the undertones of what Chizuru's usually going on about, either.

- Ishida Uryuu: Momoko likes Ishida and admires him because of his various talents, but he also makes her a little sad because of his close relationship with Ying.

- Kuchiki Rukia: Momoko's not talked to her enough to get a solid impression of her.

- Kurosaki Ichigo: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Bob the Angry Flower: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Buffy Summers: Momoko looks at Buffy as an upperclassman/senpai. Obviously, she thinks she's really cool, but she's also happy that a cool older girl would talk to her, too. 

- Rosette Christopher: Even though they're cabinmates, Momoko's not talked to her enough to get a solid impression of her.

- Nokoru Imonoyama: From what she's seen of Nokoru, Momoko likes him. She thinks he's very noble for wanting to protect people, and would probably try to help him with anything he asked her to do.

- Allen Walker: Somehow, Momoko hasn't interacted with Allen all that much. O_o I'm a little mystified as to why. Maybe he tends to attract people with problems, whereas Momoko's more used to dealing with others' problems and not her own?

- Bart Allen/Impulse: Momoko likes Bart, but doesn't really have any real impression of him outside of thinking he's a very nice and hyper boy.

- Beast Boy: Momoko thinkshe's very cool and would like the chance to talk to him more - she just never happens to run into him.

- Starfire: Momoko's not talked to her enough to get a solid impression of her.

- Kon-El/Superboy: Momoko appreciates his efforts to help people and be big brotherly, but thinks he's trying too hard to be cool. Whenever he does, he generally makes her want to laugh, but she's a little too polite to do so. ^^

- Amane Misa: The rivalry between Misa and Ying has gone right over Momoko's head, although if she figured it out, she'd probably be a little more uneasy around Misa. As it is, Misa's the kind of girl that Yuri and Hinagiku wouldn't like, but Momoko would ask them to give her a chance anyway - which is to say that she's a little wary of the cutesy act she puts on, but is willing to give Misa a chance anyway, despite her better judgement.

- Kagami Taro: Momoko hasn't interacted with him much outside of when he was a girl, but she thinks Taro's a very sweet, if somewhat shy, boy.

- L: Momoko has never really interacted with L much, probably because she sees him as being too adult to be interested in talking to her much.

- *Mello: Momoko thinks Mello is a nice, if somewhat reserved, boy. She's also vaguely aware that he's very smart. Despite being initially vaguely intimidated by him because of his intelligence, she's actually grown to look at him more like a female classmate because of their magical girl adventures (a female classmate vice a male classmate, because to Momoko, you become close friends with the girls, but not the boys really. She has a different relationship with Mello than she would have with a regular boy her age).

- Near: Pretty much the same thing as Mello, only she thinks Near is a little bit more shy. She mostly likes him in association with Mello, not really because she's interacted with him a whole lot.

- Raito: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Edogawa Conan: Momoko likes him well enough, but never finds a chance to talk to him anymore.

- Kuroba Kaito: Pretty much the same thing as Conan.

- Ichijouji Ken: Momoko likes Ken, but never really has a chance to talk much with him.

- Motomiya Daisuke: Doesn't talk to him much, but Momoko would like to photograph his soccer games, if he ever manages to organize one.

- Susan Sto Helit: Momoko's not really talked to her a whole lot, but likes her - they bonded over how icky the bugs were. :P

- Gan Ning: Momoko mostly knows Gan Ning through Lu Xun. She likes him well enough, but they've never really had much of a chance to interact. She does appreciate it when he takes up for her, though.

- *Huang Yue Ying: Momoko likes Ying and wants her approval - so much so that she's willing to do stupid/crazy things to get it. It also makes her a bit sad that she feels like there's really nothing she can do that would be helpful to Ying; anything Momoko can do, Ying can probably do better. Momoko can also remember a time when she and Ying got along well, so it also upsets her that they really don't anymore. She's slowly coming to understand that most of Ying's problem with her comes from her relationship with Boyue; oddly enough, this makes her feel a little better about it (not being able to figure out why Ying suddenly started getting irritated with her was bothering her). So in short, Momoko misses Ying's friendship and wants to try to get it back.
 
- Jiang Wei: Another big one. Momoko is (obviously) madly in love with Boyue. Contrary to what people may think, however, she's seriously not thinking of marrying him as soon as camp ends. She's well aware that she's only thirteen and is definitely not ready to get married yet. In fact, she really barely even considers herself 'engaged' (and it makes her a little nervous when people say it like that, too) - she only looks at their relationship as being a sort of 'promise' thing, that they're not *officially* engaged, but one day *will* be. Also, because of how much she thinks of him, Momoko has gotten into the habit of second-guessing situations that may be dangerous - if she doesn't think she can take an opponent, she won't engage them specifically because she would either get hurt or because Boyue would have to bail her out. So he's unwittingly taught her a bit of strategy!

- Ling Tong: Gongji's a special case. You never see these two interact because, well, I don't feel like spamming myself. :P But basically, Momoko likes Gongji well enough and his sarcasm goes right over her head. If he's condescending or snarky to her, she doesn't notice.

- *Lu Xun: Momoko shared a special relationship with the first Lu Xun - he was her first real crush at camp, and even after that they remained good friends. Even now, if Momoko has to think about the first Lu Xun for more than a moment, she'll start to tear up. Oddly enough, the second Lu Xun doesn't make her all that sad - maybe a little bit, but she's mostly just happy that he's got a second chance at life now. She doesn't share the same close relationship with the second one, and in fact feels like it's her responsibility to help look out for him (because the first one helped her when she was new to camp).

- Zhang He: At first Momoko liked Junyi. That lasted all of half of one conversation, until she found out that he might try to kill Boyue. For a while, she flat out didn't like Junyi and would go out of her way to either pester or thwart him. After a couple of more conversations, though, she realized that the idea of Junyi recruiting Boyue bothered her worse than him just trying to kill him, and for some reason this caused her to actually be afraid of him. She's been avoiding him ever since (but will still watch anytime he talks to Boyue).

- Egala: Momoko's not talked to her enough to get a solid impression of her.

- Excel: Momoko thinks she's slightly unhinged, but the well-meaning sort anyway.

- Ropponmatsu II: Momoko's not talked to her enough to get a solid impression of her (outside of 'oh, she's adorable!').

- Erk: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Hanajima Saki: Momoko's not talked to her enough to get a solid impression of her.

- Honda Tohru: Momoko thinks Tohru's very nice and enjoys talking to her. They've not talked enough to have built up much of a relationship, but it's essentially the same as two friendly classmates.

- Sohma Hiro: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Sohma Kyo: Momoko likes Kyou quite a bit, but hasn't seen him in awhile and wishes he'd get along with his cousin a little more.

- Sohma Yuki: Momoko likes Yuki, too, although she thinks he's very shy. She'd like to see him open up to people a little more and get along with his cousin, too!

- Sohma Shigure: Officially Momoko's favorite counselor! She's a sucker for flattery, what can I say? She pretty well takes Shigure at face value and doesn't seem to notice that he can be duplicitous or manipulative.

- Sohma Ayame: Momoko's second favorite counselor! He's like Shigure, but she's not talked to him as much. But he did lend her some books, and that's always good! :D

- Uotani Arisa: Momoko doesn't really know Uo very well, but sort of thinks of her as the older girl that you're really not cool enough to talk to. :P In other words, she finds her intimidating.

- Alphonse Elric: Momoko likes Al very much, especially as a small child. When he's in that form, he makes her feel like a big sister.

- Edward Elric: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Russell Tringham: Momoko thinks he's something of a jerk, and can't understand what he's talking about when he innuendoes at her.

- Sagara Sousuke: Momoko thinks he's a little strange, but is also glad that he's a *good* kind of strange. He helped get rid of Tetora when he was pestering her, and really that can never be a bad thing in Momoko's book.

- Katou Masaru: Momoko thinks of Katou more or less like a friendly classmate (possibly an older one, heh). They've worked together before, and she always appreciates his help.

- Kurono Kei: Momoko doesn't really know Kei much, but thinks of him as a nice, friendly guy. And wonders how he managed to get fleas that one time.

- Nishi Jouichirou: Momoko's wary of Nishi because of how he always hurts Ari, but because Makie and Kira vouched for him, she's willing to give him a chance.

- Amano Ginji: Momoko thinks he's adorable and would probably go out of her way to help him if he needed it.

- Midou Ban: Pissed Momoko off that one time by making fun of her chest. >|

- Athrun Zala: Momoko started out not liking Athrun much because of the whole DeathPac thing, and thinks he deserved everything he got there. But she's also been willing to forgive and forget about that, and is now actually pretty fond of him.

- Auel Neider: Auel got off on the wrong foot with Momoko by giving her a silly nickname. Since he was nice to her after Sasuke's birthday party, though, she's come to like him a lot more.

- *Cagalli Yula Athha: Momoko likes Cagalli even though they've only known each other a short time. They actually have a couple of personality traits in common, apparently, and will probably talk more in the future. 

- Heine Westenfluss: A bit like L, Momoko considers Heine to be sort of out of her league. She likes him and will stop by for tea if he offers, though.

- *Kira Yamato: Momoko adores Kira, and looks at him sort of like a brother. She hates to see people pick on him (even people she'd otherwise like), and will even fight them over him if she thinks they're going too far. She would also encourage Kira equally as Shinn to persue Lu Xun's affections - she really can't decide between the two of them who would be better. :P

- Lacus Clyne: Momoko's not talked to her enough to get a solid impression of her.

- *Meer Campbell: Momoko doesn't really talk that much to Meer (she still thinks her name is Lacus, btw), but she's got no problem with her, really. She thinks she's a little odd, and at one point was jealous of her chest, but other than that she likes her.

- Nicol Amarfi: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Rey za Burrel: Momoko likes Rey and actually thinks of him as something of a little brother because of the time she spent taking care of him when he had the chibi disease. She has no real clue how homicidal/maniacal he can be. ^^

- *Shinn Asuka: Momoko likes Shinn about as much as she likes Kira. Actually, everything I typed about Kira could apply equally to Shinn here, except that Momoko thinks Shinn's a bit... hyper. And she thinks that it's generally amusing.

- Yzak Jule: Momoko thinks Yzak's a bit of a snob, actually, but she's not interested enough about it to really bother him. It's a big enough camp that they don't ever really have a reason to talk that much.

- Dearka: Dearka's teasing actually reminds her a lot of Yousuke. And like Yousuke, it makes her want to punch Dearka in the mouth, except that she really can't bring herself to *dislike* him. So she'll just snap and yell at him unless he's being nice instead. :3

- Chang Wufei: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Dorothy Catalonia: Momoko's not talked to her enough to get a solid impression of her.

- Heero Yuy: Momoko likes Heero, but really thinks he needs to lighten up a bit. C'mon, Hee-chan, wearing a dress isn't *that* bad, is it?

- Colin Creevey: AHH, A KINDRED SPIRIT! Momoko likes having another photographer around to compare notes with. Also, he made their darkroom! Although he's not been around as much lately.

- Draco Malfoy: Momoko's not talked to him much, but anytime she has, he's been cordial to her. Whether that's out of condescension or just because he can't be fucked to be nasty to her, I don't know. And it doesn't particularly register with Momoko either way, so she actually has a fairly decent impression of Draco.

- Fred Weasley: Hasn't seen him in a while, but does like Fred when he's around. He cheered her up once, after all! And he has neat hopping chocolate frogs! &hearts;

- Tom Marvolo Riddle: Momoko's only met him once so far, but likes him a lot from that one meeting. Anyone who would volunteer to bring her food items can't be bad, right? :D

- Zim: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Ron Stoppable: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Murata Ken: Momoko thinks Ken's a nice enough guy, as long as he's not trying to be a playboy. Which she thinks he fails miserably at, but wishes him the best of luck anyway - WITH SOME OTHER GIRL. I think he's gotten hit with the Jiang Wei picspam more than anyone else at this point. o_o

- Wolfram von Bielefield: Momoko's not had many conversations with Wolfram, but the ones she has had have basically been her trying to convince him that humanity is a-okay! From this, though, she's gotten a fairly good impression of him. She likes him, she just thinks he's a little... loud sometimes.

- Shibuya Yuuri: Momoko likes Yuuri in part because he's just a normal schoolboy to her, even though he's a demon (Momoko feels more comfortable around Japanese students in general, anyway - they're more 'normal' to her). She also thinks he's a very nice guy. 

- Tetra: From what interactions Momoko's had with Tetra, she thinks she's fun and cool, but also that she's a bit out of her league.

- Evangeline A.K. McDowell: Momoko knows she should be scared of Eva because she's a vampire and all, but... she just can't bring herself to be. Maybe it's because Eva looks like a little kid, or maybe it's because she blames herself for getting bitten by Eva, but she feels sorry for her. Living off of blood has to be a hassle. :(

- Hasegawa Chisame: Momoko doesn't really know Chisame well, although what interactions they've had have been pleasant enough.

- Makie-chan: (discontinued) Makie-chan was Momoko's best friend at camp really. She wonders what happened to her (she's not seen her in weeks), but doesn't think anything's out of the ordinary yet. I mean, people wander off all the time in camp... right?

- Axl: I think Momoko's reaction to Axl can best be summed up as ""What's a Reploid?""

- Nishizono Tetora: Tetora seriously, majorly, petrifyingly, <i>scares</i> Momoko. She <i>knows</i> he kills people (possibly for fun) and she knows that he would have no problems killing her if he could. And because she also knows that she's not physically very strong, and that her powers would very likely have little effect on him, he also makes her feel very helpless (the most she could probably hope for would be to blind him with a Bridal Flash and then run the hell away). Really, it's comparable to the way most women feel if they start being followed by a stalker. She's been content to hide from and avoid him since Boyue 'scared' him away. If he confronts her, however, depending on what kind of day she's had, she'll either whimper and hide or try to bluff him into leaving her alone.

- Okuzaki Akira: Momoko was very embarrassed to think that she'd mistaken Akira for a girl (when in fact... Akira *is* a girl. Eheh).

- Suzushiro Haruka: Since Momoko doesn't really *remember* being brainwashed by the Director, the only times she's spoken with Haruka have led her to think that, while Haruka may be nice, her hang-ups about same-sex relationships are just, well... strange.

- Akimichi Chouji: Momoko likes Chouji in the way one would like a classmate. She thinks he's a very sweet boy.

- *Haruno Sakura: Momoko likes Sakura, but honestly gets rubbed the wrong way by her roughly half the time. Sakura's tested her patience before, particularly over Sasuke (Momoko thinks she'd be much better off giving up on him, which is actually pretty rare for her), but also thinks that she'd be much happier if she could find a boy that would make her happy.

- Hyuuga Hinata: Momoko thinks Hinata is really cute and sweet and even though they're roughly about the same age, she still gets a major big sister thing happening whenever they talk. She really just wants to hug her. :D

- Hyuuga Neji: Momoko's not really spoken to Neji a whole lot, but has a decent enough impression of him.

- Nara Shikamaru: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Rock Lee: Momoko likes Lee's energy and his devotion to Sakura. It's been one of her personal missions to try and get him together with Sakura, because while she may have doubts about Sakura from time to time, she still thinks that anyone as devoted as Lee is deserves the object of their affection. If Lee asks her to (or appears to need it), Momoko will try to help in whatever way possible.

- Uchiha Itachi: Momoko doesn't really know him well personally, but knows that several other campers hold him in high regard. As such, she respects him, but is also sort of intimidated by him. (Also, Boyue commenting about girl!Itachi's breasts made her like >:E but that was more at Boyue - she knows it's not Itachi's fault)

- Uchiha Sasuke: Momoko thinks he needs to lighten up. A lot.

- Uzumaki Naruto: Momoko's not really had a whole lot of dealings with Naruto (either of them), but when he's being friendly she likes him. When he's being 'RAWR', she either avoids or mouths off at him.

- Yakushi Kabuto: Momoko actually likes Kabuto a lot, both as a person and because she knows Heather loves him. He got on her good side almost immediately upon entering camp by 'saving' her from Hamelin, and she's liked him ever since. She has no clue about his duplicitous nature, and thinks he's just a nice, unassuming doctor-ninja.

- Yamanaka Ino: Momoko doesn't know Ino well, but is pretty willing to accept her as long as she doesn't notice her doing anything mean to anyone.

- Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV/""Evil King Stan"": Momoko thinks Stan's mean, basically. She won't try to stop him unless he actually tries to take over the camp/world or something, but she'll yell at him if he starts being mean to Ari.

- Ari: Momoko likes Ari a lot (even though they barely get to interact) and will stick up for him if she sees someone picking on him. Also, when Makie was in camp, she actively encouraged her to persue Ari because she thought he deserved someone nice like Makie.

- Tony Tony Chopper: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Usopp: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Sunako: Momoko thinks Sunako's a little strange, but most of her strangeness just goes right over her head. She appreciates that she wanted to stick up for her against Tetora, though, and that she cooked for her when she was feeling sick. After Sunako's been in camp a little longer, I'm sure they'll be great friends.

- Ash Ketchum: Momoko likes Ash, but also realizes that he often makes people uncomfortable. She'll occasionally try to dissuade him from doing things that she knows will irritate the other people in camp, but for the most part is generally amused by his energy.

- Brock: Momoko likes Brock and thinks he's really just a reallyreally nice guy. When he hits on her, it goes right over her head.

- Inui Sadaharu: Momoko likes Inui, but really thinks he should get out more. ^^ She also enjoys volunteering information for him.

- Mizuki Hajime: Hee! &hearts; Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him, but her player adores him. 

- Niou Masaharu: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Kuno Tatewaki: Momoko's not talked to him enough to get a solid impression of him.

- Hibiki Ryouga: Momoko likes Ryouga and thinks his pig form is cute. It doesn't phase her at all to see him change. ^^ I don't think she quite realizes he's supposed to be a martial artist, though. ^^;;

- Himemiya Anthy: Momoko is at least half-way sure that Anthy is another Love Angel (Angel Rose? Well... she *does* say she's the Rose Bride, and that red thing looks awfully like a wedding dress...), but hasn't had a real opportunity to ever talk to her much to confirm it. :(

- Molly Hayes: Momoko looks at Molly like an underclassman/kohai. They don't talk much, but Momoko would probably help her with anything she wanted help with.

- *Kaiou Michiru: Momoko's not talked to Michiru much, but when she did, she got the distinct impression that Michiru was ALL KINDS OF AWESOME. She really admires the violin skillz, too.

- *Mizuno Ami: Momoko really likes Ami (she already refers to her as Ami-chan with her having been in camp for less than a week) and probably views her as the closest thing to one of her regular classmates that she's come across in camp so far. In truth, she reminds her a lot of Yuri, only more concerned for her studies and less concerned about her appearance. She knows that Ami has some kind of magical powers, but hasn't seen them yet.

- *Tennou Haruka: Momoko likes Haruka a lot and thinks of her as 'that really cool older girl that's really too good to talk to me but does so anyway'. She enjoys talking to her a *lot*.

- Son Goku: Momoko looks at Goku like another classmate, but knows that she's heard of him *somewhere* before - she just can't remember *where*! (I think she could miss a lot of the pop culture references, but the Saiyuki legend is pretty wide-spread in Japan, so I'm sure she'd have heard part of it at least once) She also likes that he appreciates her cooking and will probably continue to feed him no matter what. :P

- *Genjo Sanzo: Sanzo intimidates Momoko a little bit, but not enough for her to be shy talking to him. She seems to get his softer side more often than a lot of other people, so she looks up to him like she would a guidance counselor in school. I don't think she even *realizes* that he's usually a raging asshole to people. :P

- Cougar Straight: Momoko likes Cougar despite him always screwing her name up - after like the eighth time he did it, she realized it wasn't on purpose and didn't get mad about it anymore. She thinks he's a little high-strung and is often taken aback by his enthusiasm, but likes him on the whole.

- *Otomiya Haine: It's almost as if they were seperated at birth (except for the whole delinquent thing)! Momoko likes Haine a lot and sees a lot of similarities between the two of them. The biggest difference is that Momoko doesn't stress quite as much over the same things Haine does - if she thinks she's not good enough at something, she'll just try harder next time, but she doesn't really spazz.

- *Heather Morris: Momoko likes Heather quite a bit. She generally understands the whole ""I was possessed by a vengeful spirit/god"" thing, but I don't think she quite realizes how... gruesome it was (all of her experience with possession has been cute and fluffy compared to what Heather went through). Heather is definitely in her 'clique', if such a thing exists, and is one of the people that Momoko would go to if she were having a problem (since Heather's come to her for her problems, too). If Heather needs help with something, Momoko will also usually volunteer, and if Kabuto ever hurts Heather in any way, Momoko will more than likely give him hell (if she thinks it's his fault).

- Minashiro Soushi: Momoko doesn't know what to think of Soushi. He's almost too distant for her to really talk to much, but she does think he's a nice guy.

- Minashiro Tsubaki: Tsuuuuuuuuuu! Momoko likes Tsubaki (despite the time she convinced Momoko she was pregnant with a canteloupe baby or... something) and would jump to help her.

- Wesley Crusher: Momoko likes Wesley a lot and wants to see him happy with Anne. She's quickly come to regard him almost as a brother or a very close male classmate.

- Anakin Skywalker: Momoko feels very close to Anakin, as he was one of the very first people she met in camp and they fought together often. She had a small crush on him at one time, but it passed quickly and now the two are good friends. She doesn't see him as much anymore, though, since she stopped warrioring all over the place. :P

- Matsuri Honjou: Uwaaah! Matsuri is like an older, maler version of Momoko, really. She loves helping him out whenever she gets the chance, especially if it concerns trying to hook two people up. 

- Michelangelo: Momoko likes Mikey, but never gets to see him. :(

- Michael: Umm. Momoko feels a certain kinship with Michael because, well, they're both angels (and he's the only other one in camp). At the moment, though, she's a bit confused by him - he came to see her in a hailstorm while she was afraid of the thunder and then spent the night (after she hugged him in a moment of panic). So she's probably going to be a bit awkward around him for awhile. She might decide to go ahead and try to hook him up with someone else just to get rid of her weird semi-crush feelings for him.

- Arhu: Momoko likes Arhu because, well, he's a cute kitty. :3 She usually tries to give him either scritchies or jerky whenever she sees him.

- Hokuto Sumeragi: Momoko likes Hokuto, but never sees her anymore. :(

- *Tot: Momoko likes Tot a lot. Momoko considers Tot one of her clique and has no inkling of what she normally does for a living. :P And unlike Misa, Momoko doesn't think Tot's cuteness is a put-on - she's not really sure whether something is actually wrong with her, or if she just likes to be really girlish, and either way she's not going to push the issue. She just accepts pretty much at face value that, well, that's the way Tot is.

- *Tsukiyono Omi: Momoko likes Omi a lot, and also has no idea of what he does for a living (other than 'he's a florist!'). She'd help him out if given the opportunity. She's not seen him in a while, but when the inevitable showdown between him and Tot happens, she's going to be majorly confused about everything.

- Cal: Momoko likes Cal, but he makes her a bit nervous with how sexual he always is. It's not something that she really likes very much, and it makes her nervous when it's so blatent. Whenever he starts doing that around her, she'll usually try to discourage it, but usually just winds up stammering and getting flustered a lot.

- Watanuki Kimihiro: Momoko likes Watanuki whenever she sees him, mostly because they both like to cook. Anytime she's given the opportunity, she'll cook with him to see if she can pick up a few tips.

- Azuma Kazuma: Momoko's not met him yet, but I'm sure she'd love for him to teach her how to bake some day. :D

- Urameshi Yuusuke: Momoko likes Yuusuke (as he reminds her of some of Yousuke's good points), but doesn't like that he gets into pointless fights. She'll usually try to talk him down from one if she sees him getting into one, but other than that, looks at him like a male classmate.

- Solid Snake: Momoko is a little intimidated by Snake's coolness and usually doesn't get what he's going on about, but likes him all the same. She doesn't understand why he had to kill her poor crab that one time, though. ;_;

- Dante: Momoko's not talked to him much, but she's still got a fairly good impression of him. He might just be too awesome for her to approach. D:

- *Nicholas Wolfwood: Another counselor that Momoko really likes a lot. She looks at him in much the same light as Sanzo, but he's not as intimidating. She also appreciates all the times he looks out for her or lets her whine at him or otherwise helps her out."

"event","Dear Papa,

How are you doing? Are you eating well? I hope you don't get too busy and forget to eat without me there!

I'm having fun at summer camp, even if it wasn't quite what I expected. It's a really strange place, and there are people from all over. Well, I guess I should've expected that, since I'm from Japan and it's in America!

But they teach us all kinds of things here! Like how to fire shotguns (don't worry, I never do, but some of the other kids do. It kind of scares me, actually) and Ishida-san is going to teach me how to knit! I'll be sure to send the first thing I knit back to you, Papa! Ying-san is teaching me how to cook and about Chinese history, too! She's very smart! Did you know she was in a lot of battles before she came here? I hope I can be as smart and strong as she is one day!

But that reminds me why I wanted to write in the first place. Since I got here, I've made lots of new friends and all - a lot of them aren't even Japanese! And even though I know I should've talked to you about it first, I also got a boyfriend. His name is Jiang Wei, but everyone calls him Boyue, and he's from China. He's very smart and strong and he's really good at martial arts and pole-fighting! I wish you could meet him, Papa - I know you would like him!

I can't really explain too much about it, but when camp is over I'm going to go live with him in China. I know I'm still really young, but I don't think that if I came back home I could get back to where he lives. And you won't have to worry about how I'll be treated, because he and Ying-san will take care of me and teach me and everything. I know I should have asked you first, but there's really no way to do that here since there are no phones and all my e-mails home bounce, but please? Please don't be upset! I'll be really happy with him, I promise!

Please tell Yuri and Hinagiku I said hi, and that I love them too, and to be happy for me, too! I hope I'll get to write more soon, so please write back? I miss you all!

Love,

Momoko"

<lj-cut text=""A Paddle In Time""><b>A Paddle In Time</b>

On a passionate and cold morning, Momoko sat in a park. It was Valentine's Day and she was all alone. Her face ached in sorrow for the secret love that she could never share. How could she expect Boyue to love someone with a forceful fingers?

Hotly, she began to recite a poem she had composed. ""Ah, my love is like a beautiful sexy whip, all on a summer's day. I wish my Boyue would lick me, in his own hot way...""

""Do you?"" Boyue sat down beside Momoko and put his hand on Momoko's man-hungry flower. ""I think that could be arranged.""

Momoko gasped passionately. ""But what about my forceful fingers?""

""I like it,"" Boyue said forcefully. ""I think it's firm.""

They came together and their kiss was like the burning heat of a summer's day.

""I love you,"" Momoko said boldly.

""I love you too,"" Boyue replied and ghosted her.

They bought a ferret, moved in together, and lived painfully ever after."

<lj-cut text=""I don't know what this is. Drabble, ficlet, fic, something, whatever. I never write anything short, anyway."">

Momoko looked up at the stars above her. The tin roof of the Arts and Crafts hut had begun to chill her back, even through the blanket she had laid over top of it. 

She let her eyes drift shut and then turned to lay her cheek on the bare chest of the man beside her. Boyue smelled faintly of pine and also a bit like sweat, but that was to be expected. This place could get hot at night.

""Is it really wise to stay up here 'til morning?"" he asked softly. Momoko was already beginning to fall asleep, her body lulled into comfortable stillness by his breathing.

""Mmmm, dunno,"" she murmurred, sounding utterly satisfied, ""Only the toucans can get this high."" Boyue seemed to relax a bit at that.

""You were the one who suggested this,"" he chided gently, ""Did you not think this out ahead of time?"" It was true. Momoko had asked if they could pretend to be married tonight.

""Not really,"" came the sleepy, slurred reply. Momoko's tired attention was vaguely focused on the strong, steady heartbeat that reached the pads of her fingers through Boyue's chest.

""Ah,"" he said. Momoko thought he might be blushing, as he had begun to feel a bit warmer. ""And you'll be okay sleeping like that? You won't get cold?"" A warm arm closed Momoko's back in its tight circle.

""S'how I sleep every night,"" she slurred, referring to the white shorts set she had worn onto the roof. Even if she were dressed in less, they had blankets, right?

There was no reply, anyway. Receiving silence as an answer, Momoko began to doze.</lj-cut>

WHUT."

"event","The Quick & Dirty of Wedding Peach:

<lj-cut text=""So not kidding about any of this. Okay, maybe just a little."">

So there's this girl named Momoko who lives with her dad who is a photographer. Her mom died when she was 3 and left this nice ruby ring behind.

One day, after a soccer match with her two friends, a guy with poofy green hair and a vest with no undershirt on grabs her and tells her to hand over the ring. And Momoko's like ""WTF NO?"" and Pluie (the guy) is all like ""I possess your friends LOL"" and Yuri and Hinagiku (the two friends) get up and attack Momoko!

But just then, a guy who looks suspiciously like an 80's hair rocker descends from heaven on a glittery stairway. He is Limone, and he is an angel in the service of the goddess Aphrodite and will fight Pluie while Momoko saves her friends yay!

So Momoko becomes Wedding Peach and depossesses her friends. Later, she finds out that Yuri and Hinagiku are Angel Lily and Angel Daisy.

Stuff happens, Momoko adopts Pluie's pet, Jama-P (who goes on to record really awful rap songs :D). Meanwhile, all three girls have a crush on Yanagiba-senpai, the really cute blonde soccer team captain. Thwarting them at every turn is the team's backup goalie, Yousuke Fuuma - who happens to argue with Momoko and call her dumb names. A lot.

UST happens, Pluie gets wise and kidnaps Yousuke because he can do weird shit, and Momoko is all ""OH NOES!"" and goes to save him. However, Pluie has screwed up one time too many, so his boss, Reine Devilla, chucks him into a vortex of destruction. Yay.

Anyway, filler villians pop up and the Angels find what the Demons have been looking for - the Saint Something Four. The Saint Something Four are the four things you're supposed to have at a wedding: something old, something new, something borrowed, etc. Each of the Love Angels gets one - Momoko's ring is the Something Old.

Filler villians go away, Ignis pops up. Ignis is a fire demon (and flamingly gay LOL - he likes to say things to Takuro like ""Your body belongs to me"") who possesses Hinagiku's childhood friend, Takuro. Takuro is a dork who can't do anything well but study and all the other kids pick on him. Oh noes! EMO! So Ignis makes him good at *everything* and he becomes super-popular. He also decides that this would be a good opportunity for him to try and get jiggy with Momoko. And Yousuke goes ""OMGWTFNO I KEEL J00!"" a lot.

Well, while Ignis is bonding with Emo!boy, a purple-haired, overly-hormonal demon girl named Potamos shows up. She hangs all over Ignis for a few episodes before shoving an icicle through his chest. Takuro is depossessed, everyone is happy, Potamos goes to the girls' school as a transfer student named Hiromi.

Hiromi decides that Yousuke makes 'her DNA tingle' (I'm not making this part up), and that she needs some lovin' from him like now. So Momoko is all like ""._."" a lot and doesn't do anything while Hiromi wraps herself around Yousuke. And Yousuke's all like ""WTF get off me I have to play soccer!!!""

While all this is going on, the fourth piece of the Saint Something Four shows up on an angel named Salvia (her real name is Scarlet O'Hara - not kidding about this either). Salvia doesn't want to purify the demons - she wants to kill them. And she wants Momoko to shut up because she's annoying. :O This becomes important later on.

So more stuff happens, Potamos realizes that OMG Yousuke really *doesn't* like her, he likes Momoko, and she goes off to live as a human. Which brings us to our next filler villian, Petora, who looks like Marshall Law from Tekken. Petora was apparently so badass that Reine Devilla put him in stone instead of letting him run around and kill the other demons. Okay. As it turns out, all he does is yell a lot.

While Petora is being unintentionally hysterical, he accidentally does something very stupid and unlocks a sealed demon whose badassity is second only to Reine Devilla herself. This guy's name is Viento. And Viento's story goes as such:

Once, fifteen years ago, the most powerful angel warrior, Celeste, fought the most powerful demon warrior, Uragano. Uragano killed the Love Angels Daisy and Lily and gravely injured Salvia. In the battle, both Celeste and Uragano knock each other to earth. Instead of doing the *right* thing and taking their UST there, they lose their memories, hook up with different people, get married, and have kids. 

Celeste, now calling herself Sakura, has a little girl named Momoko. Now, remember DNA-tingly guy? Yeah. Uragano is Yousuke's dad, making him half-demon. Oh, and Viento? That's Yousuke. Whoops. Sucks to be Momoko.

Meanwhile, Yousuke is having these blackouts and going ""Gee, what was I doing just now? Why do I feel like I just totally pwned someone?"" Strangely enough, these tend to occur right after Momoko and her buddies have just gotten their asses beaten (in a totally not-innuendo laiden fight sequence) by Viento. Hmmmm. 

In the midst of all this, Limone almost dies in battle. Which causes the Love Angels to realize that he's actually their old pal Yanagiba-senpai. Oh, haha, guess that's why they had the same voice actor, huh? As it turns out, Limone and Lily had a little something-something going on in that past life thing, and they continue it in the present. For about three episodes, before Yanagiba loses his memories of being Limone and of liking Yuri. WHOOPS!

Stuff happens, Yousuke officially becomes Momoko's boyfriend - right in time for her to watch him transform into Viento. WHOOPS AGAIN! She cries in the middle of her wedding speech. It's beautiful.

Anyway! After about an episode of trying *not* to let Yousuke realize he's a demon, Salvia decides that this is bullshit and goes to kill him herself. She's a good friend like that. Yousuke, however, is all like ""WTF crazy bitch with big sword I thought you were Momoko's friend why are you trying to kill me AHHHHH!?"" And Yuri and Hinagiku are like ""STFU h0r, he's not hurting anything!"" Momoko, meanwhile, has locked herself in her room and won't come out because WTF how *do* you deal with finding out your boyfriend's a demon?

Yousuke finds out that he's a demon, his life sucks, the demons want him to come fight for them, he sulls up and ignores Momoko for about an episode, UST, UST, UST, Yousuke finds out that his dad was killed by Reine Devilla because he didn't want to go back and fight for the Demon World after he had lived as a human, Yousuke becomes understandibly enraged by this, and through the power of hatred learns to control his demon powers. Or something.

Fighting, fighting, Limone gets his memory back, Yousuke and Momoko reconcile, which is a good thing because oh look! The series is over in two more episodes! More fighting, and for some reason Momoko's friends (yes, including Salvia, whose had her life saved by Yousuke at least once now) decide that she and Yousuke should get married. At fourteen. Yeah, what was it Shakespeare said about that - ""Younger women have happy brides and mothers made"" or something like that? 

And I mention Shakespeare because the last episode? Is very much a rendition of Romeo and Juliet, now with added demons! So this wedding happens - Mercutio/Limone plays piano, Friar/Takuro does the ceremony, the three nurses stand around, and at one point everyone but Takuro, Momoko, and Yousuke actually <i>leave the chaple</i> because bad shit is going down outside. Is it just me, or is something *wrong* when all your wedding party gets up and walks out?

Anyway, climactic final battle, Reine Devilla is healed by the power of love, and in true Romeo and Juliet fashion, Yousuke and Momoko both die. But then the power of love brings them back. Or something. Whatever. :D

Then everyone volunteers to have their memories erased, except for Yousuke, because he's a demon and can't go see Aphrodite or something (OMFG DISCRIMINATION! HE CAN'T HELP THE WAY HE WAS BORN!). But Yousuke gets his memory erased anyway, because Momoko thinks it'll be good for him. This is where the OVA, DX, picks up.

Basically, in DX, all four girls get new battle outfits, Salvia almost marries Lucifer (I kid you not, only his name's Clark Oasis. But... LUCIFER OMG), Hinagiku *finally* hooks up with Takuro, and somehow the girls switch bodies with three cats (this is where the picture of Kitty!Momoko comes from, btw - also, for some reason, being possessed by a cat causes Momoko's breast size to increase by at least a cup. Huh). DX was smoking the good crack.</lj-cut>

In case you're wondering, my Momoko comes to camp right after Pluie's been killed. She does have the ring with her, but it's not been activated into the Saint Something Old yet (I don't think the anime ever really goes into detail, but I *think* it might require Yousuke for it to work like it should). Also, at that point in the anime, Momoko's relationship with Yousuke hasn't solidified into anything more than ""I think I might like him, but he really annoys me"". The biggest reason I picked that point in the series, though, is because it follows an entire year from spring to spring. After the girls defeat Pluie, it's summer. Although it *is* nice to not have her tied to Yousuke, too (so she can develop silly crushes and relationships whee)."

"event","Yesterday was kind of exciting - me and Anakin-san and Kuroba-san and Conan-san all had to fend off Athrun-san's AngstPac blob thing. We weren't able to defeat it ourselves, but we did get away in time for it to go back to Athrun-san. He says he's going to handle it himself, so that's good, I guess. 

Today started out a lot better, though! I got to dress Lu Xun-san up a lot and make him pretty! ^-^ It was a lot of fun! We tried on sooooooo many outfits. :D

But then he wanted me to tie him up and pretend to have kidnapped him. I don't know why, but I was having a lot of fun until everyone else took it seriously. They didn't realize we were just playing! I think I made Anakin-san mad, too. ;_; He's scary when he's mad. 

And now I'm hiding under the table in the Arts and Crafts hut. I think I'll stay here tonight and hope nothing gets me - it seems safe so far."

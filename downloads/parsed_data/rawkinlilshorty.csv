I wish I did a bit better, but no matter, I passed the class! lol <br />Besides math, I think I did pretty ok this semster! I mean, I didn't do THAT bad in math, but I didn't do as well as I had hoped too. =/ I really enjoyed this semster actually..my humanities teacher was soo incredibly<span><span> aw</span></span><span><span>e</span></span><span><span>some!</span></span></span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 0);""><span> I learned sooooo freaking much! And learned to kind of look at things differently. The class was truly a great experience. </span></span></span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 0);""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br /><br />Can't wait to do awesome stuff this summer!

RELAX! lol like I don't do that enough already..lol <br />And now that I can drive again, I plan to be going to kendall more again! <br /><br />Soo many things going on in me head. eh. I hate it. I wanna fix everything but I just can't. I'm trying my hardest to do so, but ehh. Im hoping soon that things will turn around, there's a definite chance they will! But I just don't know when..<br />Ah..my luck..lol..Most of you know about my relationship with LUCK..It is a shitty one indeed! lol ehh w/e we'll see what happens..<br /><br />In other news, work..it is a love/hate relationship! I love that fact that it is sooo ridiculiously slack, but i hate the hate that they cancel it soo much. Maybe if work wasn't so FAR from my home here in rural country, the fact that they cancel so much wouldn't bother. hmm idk.. <br /><br />I want a trampoline! lol o0o man! Since my surgery I haven't really been able to do too much and when I'm all better, I really wanna just like, rent one. lol for like a week to bonce around on. I think it would be sooooooooo fun! And then we could have like a trampoline party! lol awesome..<br /><br />FINALLY! I get paid this week! It's about time! I haven't gotten a pay check in ages! I'm so exciting for moneys! lol I gotta dye my hair! And actually do it this time! I'm always say I'm going too and I never do..lol <br /><br /></span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 153, 0);"">Well, I am looking forward to having an AMAZING summer! I love summer. There's something soo magical about it. How everyday seems like a Saturday,how time just melts away. The long beautiful days and even longer hot and sweaty, unpredictable nights. And everything is just more fun in the summer! <br />What do you guys wanna do this summer? <br /><br />That's all for now!<br /><br />peace, love and happiness! <br /><br /></span><br /><br /><br /><br /></span><br />"

"event","We always thought of the ocean as a never-ending supply of food. But recent studies have shown that this is dreadfully untrue. People have always believed that if we replace what we take out by putting more in, that the cycle would continue to work. Over fishing seems to be a big problem in the ocean. For most island Pacifiers, fish is a crucial part of their diet. Kiribati consumption is as high as 200 kg per person annually. The increasingly high demand for fish and other seafoods is causing fishermen to catch more and more frequently. Though, this can be very unhealthy because it can be days, weeks and even months before the fish make it to the market and there is no for sure way to know how or when the fish were caught.

oh! ok, if your looking to see a good movie...dont go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory! lol yeah Johnny Depp was AMAZING! but the movie sucked! if ya do decide to see it, acid is a must have! lol but ok really if you wanna see a good movie, look up Empire Records. great funny movie! shelly approved! and it has some pretty awesome songs in it! yeah...its DEFINTELY shelly approved!

w/e live with it.

never do things you may some day regret...it keeps you attached to things that are better if let go.

ive learned this...

anyway..wow summer has blown. ive been sick since the first week so that has been preventing me from going out as much as  would like. and of course since God above hates me...just when things were starting to look up, everything just went back to shit. but i should have known things would never change. cus they never do...so why now?

and on top of that...im just really confused. not really sure what to do, where to turn, how to feel or what to say. *sigh*

ok forget..thought i would want to talk about this more but apparently i dont...

dont ask cus chances are i wont tell....

Revolutionary Vol. 1	Dance With the Devil

[Verse 1]
I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
his primary concern, was making a million
being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen
he used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams
a corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen
nigga never had a father and his mom was a feen
she put the pipe down, but forever yeah she was sober
her sons heart simultaneously grew colder
he started hanging out selling bags in the projects
checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
he was fascinated by material objects
but he understood money never bought respect
he build a reputation cuz he could hustle and steal
but got locked once it didn't hessitate to squeal
so criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
you see me and niggaz like this have never been equal
I dont project my insurecurity's at other people
he feeded for props like addicts with pipes and needles
so he felt he had to proof to everyone he was evil
a fever minded young man with infinite potetial
the product of a ghetto ... capatalistic mental
coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
but he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed


[Hook]
Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
you propably only did a month for minor offences
ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
but then again there's always the wicked at new and advanced
dance forever with the devil on a code cell block
but thats what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot

[Verse 2]
So Billy started robbing niggaz, anything he could do
he'd get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew
starting fights over little shit, up on the block
stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
working overtime for making money for the crack spot
hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
for filling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
tired of the block niggaz treating him the same
he wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
but when he tried to step to 'em, niggaz showed him no love
they told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
any bitch nigga with a gun, can bust slugs
any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
even Puffy smoked the motherfucker up in a club
but only a real thug can stab someone till they die
standing in front of them, starring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
and they wanted to test him, before business started
suggested raping a bitch to proof he was cold hearted
so now he had a choice between going back to his life
or making money with made men, up in the cife
his dreams about cars and ice, made him agree
a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three

[Hook]


[Verse 3]
They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
untill they saw a woman on the street walking alone
three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
and so they quietly got out the car and followed her
walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
they wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw
so Billy oaked her up and grapped the chick by the hair
and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around
the shirt covered her face, but she screamed the clouts
so Billy stomped on the bitch, until he broken her jaw
the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
blood leaking through the corpse, she cried silently
and then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was meant to go first, but he ????? turn
ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned
a broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren't concerned
when they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and broos
one of them niggaz pulled out a brand new twenty-two
they told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
he thought about it for a minute, she was practicly dead
and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head


(Sample from ""Survival of the Fittest"" by Mobb Deep)
I'm falling and I can't turn back
I'm falling and I can't turn back


[Verse 4]
Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life
he thought about the cold pain with the platinum and ice
and he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover
but what he saw made him start the cringine studder
cuz he was starring into the eyes of his own mother
she looked back at him and cried, cuz he had forsaken her
she cried more painfully, than when they were raping her
his whole world stopped, he couldn't even contiplate
his corruption had succesfully changed his fate
and he remembered how his mom used to come home late
working hard for nothing, cuz now what was he worth
he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
and crying out to the sky cuz he was lonely and scared
but only the devil responded, cuz god wasn't there
and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
they say death take you to a better place but I doubt it
after that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
and listen cuz the story that I'm telling is true
cuz I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom to
and now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
infact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
and every street cypher listening to little thugs flowe
he could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
the devil grows inside the hearts of the selvish and wicked
white, brown, yellow and black colored is not restricted
you have a self destructive destiny when your inflicted
and you'll be one of gods children and fell from the top
there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
so when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
because the dance with the devil might last you forever

thats a quote from a Bright Eyes song. no, i dont really listen to them and to tell you the truth, ive never heard the song from which that quote is pulled. im sorry if this bothers anyone, but the song was in one of my friends profile and i really liked it. infact, i loved it! and i couldnt agree more. i know a lot of people may not see the beauty and reality to that, but its very true. right now life, at least for me, isnt exactly something i wanna be living and it never really has. and for anyone who has ever felt the same way, will agree when i say that we want nothing more than to completely numb ourselfs so we cant feel a thing. and we will most likely proceed in doing a number of things to get to that level. cus, really, its all about now. and if your not happy now, whats the point?"

"event","*exhale* hello there all! whell, its been awhile since ive updated and i realized that everytime i updated, the entry pretty much consisted of quizes! so, i figured id stop in and write alittle...

wow, a lot of crap is going on, or so to say, its crap. idk anymore ya know? ive just been doing a lot and probably too much, thinking lately. during this past week alone ive realized so many things and theyve just all got my thinking. this weekend wasnt that grand either. i didnt really wanna hang out too much but on Friday night i did. cant say i enjoyed myself much though. the only real good that came out of it was a long chat me and carlos had. i love that boy! 

whell moving onward, i guess im just not happy...and ive really come to realize it. life is passing me by rather quickly and theres nothing i can do about it. but maybe theres nothing i actually want to do about it...*sigh* i just dont know and i guess when i think about it, that is the real problem right now...make sense? im sure it does..maybe it doesnt but no matter....

whell, i was going to or at least i had planned to go out and give this ""live your life!"" thing a try! but after some thought (and the finding out that the plans were Dolphin) i realized i didnt really wanna be around people too much. i spent most of the day looking for books to read. yes, books. to read. lol sounds odd i know, but right now i really need something to loose myself in. something fake, something out of my reality, you get me?

so yeah,  thats a basic overview of life for me...not very detailed, i know...but at one point in my life, i didnt say anything, then i said everything...and now i just want to go back to saying nothing....

much peace and love,

im still trying to figure out who my true friends really are and thats another thing i hate...im not sure who i can talk to and trust. things are just really complicated and depression seems to be the only thing that will stick with me through my ups and downs. idk if that makes any sense to anyone but w/e...like i know i have friends, but which ones are really gunna be there, which ones will never leave? which one or ones will never turn their back on me and which ones really care? dont worry, this is not a question in-which i want people to comment and answer...its just one of those questions ive been really thinking about lately. 

whell anyways...today we had NRT! how exciting! lol yeah, not really! and i figured that my day would only proceed in getting worse as i was doing this ridiculous test cus i was sure i wouldnt know what i was doing, but actually my mood stayed pretty much the same.  lol it wasnt that bad...ok, so i lied! the math was horribly hard! out of 50 questions, i got to like number 39 when hour was up and guessed the all rest of the damn thing! but, lucky me, i had like the two smartest people sitting next to me so i just copied most of the test from them! lol oops...w/e! my testing location teacher brought us food...orange juice and dough-nut holes! yumm!

i just hate the way things change so predictably in my life....i know this is hard for most people to understand cus hey! what do i have to be depressed about? w/e you know what forget it....thats all im gunna say about this!

anyway...whell i still dont know what i got on that 6 grade chemistry test i took like 2 weeks ago! and yeah...FCAT was a little bitch! wow, can you say difficult? cus i know i can! but the reading was actually quite nice to me! i think i did pretty damn shabby! *knocks on wood* but that math!

"event","""Self Injury Awareness Day""- March 1st

1st of March is Self Injury Awareness Day.
SIAD is a global awareness day, and yet it is not supported by any nations' governments, because it is a grass-roots idea. Somehow, in the mists of time, the date was set as the 1st of March, and organisations around the world make extra efforts to raise awareness ready for SIAD.

The colour for some reason is orange. Some people wear an orange ribbon, but in the past SIAD bracelets have been worn:
- Orange beads if you self harm;
- Orange and white if you used to;
- White if you have never self harmed but understand.

If you agree that people should be made aware of this issue and this day, re-post this in your journal."

Just off of the two-lane where the school bus used to stop
Was a little wooden A-frame with a yellow tin roof top
One day it was raining on this world
She saidhave you ever really, really ever kissed a girl
Baby ll be your Huckleberry, you dot have to double dare me
If the storm gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
Yore so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
Wll grow up and wll get married
m gonna be your Huckleberry
Later on that summer we went to the county fair
They had a brand new roller coaster and everyone was scared
It was two bucks to experience the thrill
She saidcome on boy les get in line ll ride it if you wil

 
Baby ll be your Huckleberry, you dot have to double dare me
If the ride gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
Yore so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
Wll grow up and wll get married
m gonna be your Huckleberry
Snuck off on a slow dance at the junior/senior prom
Went looki for some romance before I had to get her home
Steami up the windows of my car
She saiduntil I get my wedding ring boy we cat go that fa
Baby ll be your Huckleberry, you dot have to double dare me
If the world gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
Yore so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
We grew up and we got married
Now look at those three little Huckleberries

ok, taking the attention away from Raul *grabs attention and puts it in pocket* hehe whell....wow...today was such a weird day!! my day definitly had its ups and its downs!

For starters, for everyone out there who thinks i hate them or dont care about them: ITS NOT TRUE!! you guys should know me so0o much better than that! but w/e if you guys honestly believe that ok fine, im not gunna stand here and make a fool out of myself trying to change that cus im honestly sick of doing it! but im also sick and tired of hearing it as whell! so just stop!  it seems like everyday im finding out that someone thinks 'our friendship is falling apart', 'you dont talk to me anymore', 'you dont care about me' and etc...so just stop. please, i dont think i can take another blow to the face like that...cus it honestly hurts me a lot more then people think everytime i hear something like that...especially if its not true. 

anyways..moving onward, along with its downs, today was also a very laughy-taffy day! lol idk...i just felt like i was laughing a lot more than usual at some points in the day! example- this morning! aww..you guys are so0o funny! John, Carlos, and Lucas! then at Marielie's house! lol umm...i had a drivers ed test thing today. got an A of course! were you expecting anything less?? lol one second thought, dont answer that! lol umm..still dont know what i got on that big chem. test i took yesterday! still nervous about it too! lol

"event","whell hello there my loves!! damn dudes, its been awhile huh? chances are not many of you will read this just because no one knows im on right now and no one is suspecting nor is anyone waiting for me to update this overrated live journal thing inwhich many self-absorbed people use to write about they're problems. since this is the case, and i honestly believe that, i am indeed self-absorbed, for i too use this mind-controlling device. ok whell enough about that! so0o have you internet dudes missed me much? i know you have!! whell it sucks because after today who knows when ill be online again for i am at Marielie's house where she has been so kind as to let me use her internet!  hehe gotta love her! (please note that i am saying all this nice stuff about her because she is standing right behind me, reading as i type!) lol jk!

whell ok, lets see...in a nutshell life for me has been moving in a downward spiral... (not so good for all those small minded people who read that line and said ""Huh??"" while making a very weird face). Im not too sure why though. It sucks though because i cant control this feeling and in the past couple days ive come to learn that many of my friends have come to think im mad at or hate them. this issnt true. i just havent been in the most talkative mood lately. i cant really explain it either...but i did finally get the chance to make better of things with people as whell!  

As most of you know, it was midterm week this past week and in general, i think i did okay... I cheated on my English objective(just for the vocab. part) and i proceeded in getting a B and then on my English essay i got an A(no cheating this time!). Im sure i did pretty good on my Health midterm and the same goes for my Spanish one. On my chemistry essay, i got a PERFECT score! go me i must say!! but then i took the objective! *cue the suspense music* yup, i did horrible! im sure of it! when i was taking that test everything i knew left me! i felt like the test was written in a totally different language! i felt so lost!! *sigh* w/e..its just a chemistry test i guess. 

whell yeah, thats my life! hehe enjoy it much? since i have nothing more to say i fear i must go! ta ta! 
love you guys!! aww..i miss this damn thing! curse this bloody internet bullshit!!! 

much peace and love,

"event","wow, lately ive been thinking about everything...life mostly....and what is the point of life? to be born into a world moving to fast for you to move along with, deal with all kinds of stupid shit, realize you cant deal with things, figure it will over be over soon; but it issent, it just goes on, and on, then somewhere along the line of life things seem good, your happy?? maybe...but then everything gets all turned upside down again but your used to it by now for its all youve ever known. but w/e then eventually you gotta go to school and learn a lot of pointless shit you may never use/see again in your life, to graduate and get a crappy job at a fast food joint place to pay the ridiculous prices of college/university to then try and get a real job in the real world. ok so now your all grown up, working your ass off in an office or w/e, following rules that someone else made inoder to get paid to feed your family. and then you grow old, and alone and die! yea life is so0o0o great???

but i guess in a sense life can be great if you want it to be. and thats all everyone really wants right? to live a long, great, happy life! *exhale* idk, ok so maybe thats just how i see life but ive realized that im going nowhere in my life. and sometimes it seems life really doesnt like me...actually thats most of the time...but i was blessed with good friends, and good, whell good friends or a least i think i have? but my point is friends-everyone needs them, everyone wants someone or someones to be able to always count on, and i have that....so why am i complaining? 

im not going to sit here and lie to you guys by telling you that im happy....cus im not....things have become too much to handle...school, friendships, grades, family, and i guess life, or at least, my life in general.i wish i could say thst i've grown used to this kind of pain, but i havent...and everytime i have to expirence it, it only hurts more....my only question is, why does this hurt so much? it shouldnt, i've gone through this all before and never felt this way. i guess its cus i've grown up and can say that i know what truly is going on....

im scared of failing my chemistry class and its only the beginning of the year, i got an F on the last chem. test i had. im doing a lot more math in that class than im doing in my actual math class...and of course its all algebra 1 stuff! which as many of you may recall, was, and still is my worst subject...but on the flip side, we got progress reports today in my math class and guess whose failing? NOPE! no me! hehe i have a B in that class! wow, i was so proud of myself that everything seemed to disappear for a moment, but when i realized that its still only the beginning of the year and the stuff we've been doing wa prolly the easiest stuff we'd do, that happy feeling left...

whell re-reading this entry really makes me want to delete it and pretend it never happened. but w/e whell im going to go now...

"event","wow dudes, it has been an insanely long day! OMG! wait, im sorry im being very selfish right now! lets start over...
heyhey all! HAPPY BIRTHDAY JIANNA!!! hehe awww...my lil G is 16 today! *tears* they grow up so fast! lol 

ok, now lets get back to the part where i was very selfish! omg dudes, today has been a very trying day! and unfortunately i feel like as days go by, it shall only grow worse! everything is literally falling apart! all those other times when people would ask whats wrong and i would say something along the lines of ""i feel like everything is falling apart."" or i would write in previous journal entries that i felt this way, ok, screw those times! those times were all cover stories! im sorry for lying guys...but this time for real, i feel like everything is working against me, everything is falling apart and theres nothing i can do! i wish i could say that i was used to this pain by now, but im not...and im scared ill never be used to it... but at the same time i feel so numb to everything else. i found out a lot of things today that i got me like really got pissed and shocked and got me thinking and got me all mad and, and now im questioning a lot of things. ive realized that the world is a fucked up place full of fucked out people...

things were so good...idk what happened.

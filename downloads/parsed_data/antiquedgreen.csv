"event","I am back from my summer in South Carolina.  I must be some kind of child to still go to summercamp, right?  Well, come may when i'm always at the end of my rope, that place puts me right back where i belong.  It reminds me of who i am and who i want to be.  So now it's august, and i am refreshed and new and a thousand times happier than i was in May, but now i'm campsick and want to be back on that lake!  I lived in a little house by the water with a wrapparound porch and rockers and a hammok.  I painted, and sang, and laughed realllllly hard, finally!

So now i'm home and a little bit lost.  I know where i'm going next, BUT, then what?  I find myself jealous of those people who are settling around me.  Moving in to their new places, and picking out bed sheets...i've got all that on hold for now and i'm gonna venture around and then figure out the next step when i'm ready.

I visited baltimore the other night and it almost made me cry to see it go on without me.  It was even more beautiful than when i had left, and the fountains were still going, and people were walking around.  I guess i sortof imagine that it holds still until i come back...how typical of me.  Nope, the world still turns.  We come and go and move on.  Cities and people alike.  When MICA starts up again, i dont even think i could set foot around there- because it's no longer mine, i'd feel like i was intruding.  rediculous, but true feelings.

I am gonna head for nantucket in a few days, it will be perfect transition into my new adventure.  Home is home-ish but its still missing.  No more friends, no stuff, not my own bed, just a house...Nantuclet wont be missing anything- anything but me.  I'm gonna sit in the window and read and eat icecream every night.  I'm gonna cycle to the beach and smile at the lifeguards and eat lots of hotdogs and dreamcicles.

Then i'll take flight
again"

"event","feeling sad.  and helpless.  there's not a whole lot that can take this feeling away, other than time i guess.  I feel transitory.  Flighty.  Duh.  I am babysitting tonight and then i'm gonna try to meet my friends for drinks for the first time since my birthday.  We really have not been together.  We are like a broken home.  It's our last week all together, i need to fuck these feelings and be with them.  We will never be this way again.  We will probably never be neighbors again.  Sad sad sad things keep popping up in my mind.  Like when i leave here, when we leave here, baltimore is just gonna sortof sizzle out...disapear.  Because what i had known as home, wont be home anymore.  baltimore will just be empty streets and other peoples homes.  

i keep thinking of ""i miss you already, i miss you always.""

i have no idea what my life has in store.  I have no idea where i'll end up.  I mean i have my ideas, but i feel like i am standing on the edge of this VAST space, and its almost time to jump.

here's what i need:

a beer
a friend
crabdip
a great cd
a post card
a kiss
many hugs
a map
a photograph
a phone charger
a time machine
boxes
crying time
imspiration
a drive
a smile"

"event","so after weeks of stressing about school (still not over)...it has started to hit me that i am leaving.  And it is pretty sad.  4 years is a pretty long time to be here and its really become home.  Park ave is very much my street and i've hiked it about a million times.  They turned the fountains on the other night and it was beautiful.  Baltimore can be so beautiful.  It IS actually charming in its own baltimore way.  

I went to hampden today to buy a table for my show, and then i put 2 hours in the meter and walked the avenue for the FIRST time.  Why do i wait until the end to discover things??  I saw a ton of gorgeous old furnature that would have been nice to have.  I found a dozen adorable shops full of cute ""me"" things.  I got some mother's day cards and a lime juicer for my mom for her margaritas.  It was so nice to walk down the streets on a gorgeous day.  All the ladies had pretty skirts on and i really felt like i was in a city of living people.  

I've also recently discovered Loch Raven Resivoir...would have been good to know...and i've also discovered restaraunts where you can eat outside and hear live music.  How i have spent so long locked up in my room?!  I have been coming out of my hibernation, slowly but surely.  I clean out my room, cleaned out my studio, i am freshening up.  New beginings are exciting, but its the endings that i forget about.  I didnt anticipate being this sad about leaving baltimore.

Here's what i will miss:

the glass paved streets
the people sitting on their stoops
the little row houses
busted brick sidewalks
mt. washington
whole foods for lunch
city cafe
my babysitting families
my friends being a only a few doors down
backporch margaritas
all the doggies i have gotten to know
park ave fountains
christmas trees in the windows, smoke in the chimneys
bolton hill in autumn..mmmmmi love
the hidden bean OHHH the hidden bean is dead
falls road, skipping class and heading for country
Daughrety's pitchers of yueng ling
the station building and its grassy hill and its clock that doesnt work, but looks like the moon
the homes i've known."

"event","I am wide awake, which would usually mean the start of a good day in a class, but i have already decided not to go at all which is very bad idea.  I can't talk myself out of it though, i am staying here.  I don't mind locking myself in my room and living off of coffee and music.  Though why do i drink coffee when today would be easier if i was asleep?  I don't know what to blame my laziness on.  I have been ""absent""(minded) since i got back from spring break which was woah, like 3 weeks ago??  I have this intense guilt and worry for not doing any work, but then again,  i dont seem to be doing anything about it, so i mightaswell forget it and enjoy my day that i am taking off.  Maybe I'll drive somewhere. I wonder what the weather is like outside.  If its nice i would go to a park and sit-give my eyes a rest for this compuer screen.  I could pick out a book and decide to read it.  I could paint and make a huge mess in the living room.  But I'll tell you right now, i predict i will barely move from this spot on the floor.  Oh Lord its April Fools day.  I dont mind being the fool."

i just lost everything that i had just written beause my computer sucks at life...so i will try to recap as elequently as i had in the origional...

life is soo full and wonderful and overwhleming.  There are so many roads to take and so many options...for an indecisive person, ive got a lot of deciding to do.  But i'm not scared or worried or nervous, and i am so excited to see where life goes.

we got back from the ocean two weeks ago, ive been having a hard time getting over it as though i've lost a lover or something. Ive been moping around the apt missing the sand and the sea.  We had a mansion on the beach and everyone felt free.  I think that EVERYONE loosens up when they are at the ocean.  I think its the way the salt in the air sticks to your hair and makes it perfectly imperfect.  Or its sand in between toes, that makes shoes completely dumb forever.  Why wear shoes when you could be by the sea with sand hugging your feet?  

Come may i will be by water again- at the lake, back at camp for one more year before i have to tuck it in my back pocket and move on.  and then in september i'll be in the carribean, working on st. john in an art department there- living in a tent hut by the beach.  oh my gosh i have been daydreaming of this for months and its actually going to happen.  

its raining in baltimore and ive got that song on repeat as i always do when it rains.  It makes me feel like missing someone, and i do.  ""i'd like to hear a little guitar...""  im going to miss here when im gone.  But that's a whole nother post in the works...

i am in love with the world lately, but it's bittersweet because i cant be everywhere at once.  ill have to remember to go step by step, and ill see it all.

"event","so my valentines was very busy and full- of good and bad-as usual, but this year the good far outweighed the bad.  Robert gave me ray and youve got mail---which is my fav but i had given away last year and just never bought it back.  And lots of reeses cups and i cried because i was in a sad mood and he knows me so well.

I ran around like a crazy person to throw a party at the last minute- bought a box of wine, picked up my jeans at the mall, surprised robert with chick-fil-a at work.  Then i babysat for the boys who were not in a good mood.  Then i ran around again getting desserts and flowers---and cleaned my apartment in only an hour.

and people came- it was like a sweet 16 cheeseball party- i loved it!  I put up hearts and served boxed wine and cookies, i wore a rose in my hair and pink satin shoes from the thrift store that were no doubt someones prom shoes in the 80s.  I got wasted and i think a few others did as well---and now i am a pile of bricks wasting my tuesday and NOT going to senior thesis.  I need to get a grip.  

But at least i had a valentines that, for the first time, was truly spent."

"event","i feel soo damn good right now.  probably the best i have felt at school in a long ass time.  I am so happy! i feel like ive caught up with myself- because for a while i was so far behind.  I have been writing a lot and that helps me figure out things or discover things i didnt know were there.  I've finally figured out why i do the things i do why i make what i make, why i love what i listen to, why i read the things i read- i am so transparent to myself right now, like for once i have a real grasp on who i am. it feels so good.  I want to make lots of art since i have been sortof faking for a while.  

Next weekend i am going down to chapel hill to see all my camp friends- i can't wait for that drive! 6 hours of me and my ipod and i can feel like its summer time if i turn the heat up high and listen to bob seagar, or the summer tape sarah gave me.  i'm gonna sing really loud and the people driving by int he other lanes will point and say--look at her she's having a blast.   OHOOOH my gosh im so annoyingly happy.

today is saturday- mike is in town again and we are all gonna go to the bar tonight.  Tina's show is up and the opening was last night.  her show fills me somehow.  It makes me really happy and proud and love her alot."

"event","This february has felt more like spring.  When i step out on the stoop in the morning, it smells like early april, or like there should be some green within sight.  I dont mind the crazy weather- it went straight from snow to warmth- its the inbetween i dont like...

i have been obsessed with words!  I am in an independent study with my poetry teacher from 2 years ago and she inspires me to write...alot.  Its all i have been doing, reading, writing, and rewriting.  I meet with her on Thursday mornings, and it is a lot of fun.  I feel so artsy- talking, one on one with coffees and sunlight, about making a bridge between objects and feeling.  I have been concentrating so much on this that art has kindof fallen to the background.  but it seems that it is always in the background of something else more prominent in my life--whatever phase it is that i'm going through at any given time.

BK gave me a cd of 12 different versions of Somewhere Over the Rainbow.  It is perfect and i listen to it every night as i fall asleep.  My cd burner is busted which sucks because i have a handful of playlists on my computer that i wanted to give to people--esp for valentines day.  

Sunday night i went home to maw and paw for dinner.  It was a nice superbowl sunday, i worked all day, came home, visited with the puppers, and then mom and i watched the halftime show- her soulmate Paul McCartney. She gave me a cd for Vday which is sweet.  Its all 60s music that she loves.

tomorrow is my collage class which i have not made up my mind about yet. I thought it would be a good one, but it is hard to take is seriously when no one else does.  It makes me miss fibers and makes me grateful for my department and my classmates who are all dedicated.  That motivates me like nothing else...literally, nothing else does.

I'd like to spend my days waking up early and walking to a market to buying fresh flowers and vegetables, and then coming back home to a big empty room with a fancy, rustic writing desk in the middle and writing about the morning on old looking paper.  How the flowers smell yellow and look like tiny firecrackers frozen in the explosion. 

I cant wait to see which (if any) of my frequent daydreams will come true??"

"event","last night we went to a party at bobby and pete's.   it was sooo fun.  I miss that kind of fun!  I feel kind of like an old lady- because sophomore year we were wild.  Junior year we were even wilder.  And now, we barely go out.  but i guess when we do its that much sweeter.  Last night we danced and danced up on the couches and i think i might have smiled the whole time.  Or maybe i was laughing the whole time...not sure.  

We woke up to chaotic snow.  Its so thick by now that i can barely see a block down the street.  Its like a white tent has been set up around our block.  It's so beautiful.  While it snows it makes the dirty city look completely pristine. I feel so so so nostalgic!  Tonight is Javi's birthday celebration.  We were gonna go out to bars, but since there's so much snow, we'll probably just stay in.  

i've been cuddling with music all day long.  today's playlist=
1. The Professor - Damien Rice
2. Orange Sky - Alexi Murdoch
3. I just dont think ill ever get over you - colin hay
4. the sea and the rhythm - iron and wine
5. water from the same source - the rachels
6. madonna - cocorosie"

"event","tonight i feel like i'm back in time to january of last year...not really, i think its just cause i've been thinking about it a lot.  and some songs just place me there at the first note.
Last January meant=

+listening to Alexi Murdoch, Orange Sky on repeat as i lay in my bed trying to sleep- but staring out the window instead -out into the view of the city.  That tiny window made it feel like baltimore was just a little town in a snow globe.

+It snowed a lot last Jan and at night it reflected back into the sky making it feel like twilight all night long.

+being a recluse- i hid away in my little room in my little attic apartment.  It seemed like my room was the deepest crevice of the house- to get there was almost like hiking a mountain and my room was the pinnacle. 

+Pumpkin spice candle

+L.L.Bean Duck Boots and lots of wool when venturing outside.

+being really really sad and lost in my own head.  yet thinking about it now somehow makes me miss that month.  Perhaps it's the safety of that warm room that i miss, or the music that i was immmersed in.  ""that's when i miss you, that's when i miss you, that's when i miss you- you who are my home.""

+the excitement and mystery of a new friend who's gone now.  It's strange that we lived in the same city for only a handful of months, yet rarely took advantage of it.  Now he's on the other side of America and its a little bit like he's been there all the while.  

What will i think about this January a year from now?"

""Someday, the light will shine like a sun through my skin and they will say, What have you done with your life? and though there are many moments i think i will remember, in the end, i will be proud to say, I was one of us."" - brian andreas in a book from gen

Friday i woke up in my house in lanham, and as i drove back to baltimore i thought ""I could just keep on driving, go straight to philly""- so i basically did and ended up with gen by 3ish.  We took a speedy tour of her friends and their homes and studios.  And we spent the night in a cozy nest of an apartment, talking with eathother and her roomate.  As tired as i was i felt awake and aware and rejuvinated.  Ready to be a student, and to be an artist, and to be anything i want to.

"event","i'm back in baltimore after a christmas at home and a new years in florida.  

This christmas lacked a little of that magic that makes christmas christmas.  It was our first christmas without my grandma since she's not well enough to travel.  So on christmas morning, it was just me and mom and dad and the dog and the bright light and big windows making the puny tree look even smaller.  And i didn't have many things to unwrap cause my christmas present was my plane ticket to florida.  I did get a yoga mat from mom, and a deviled egg platter from grandma's china collection.  and i'm grateful.

florida was a great vacation where i had nothing to do but lie in the sun- i only had to choose between lying in the sun at the pool, or lying in the sun at the beach...a little of both.  New Years was good too- not too crazy, but certainly not dull.  a bonfire seems a perfect solution for any occasion.

Now i'm back in baltimore a week before school starts because there's really no use in being home, and because here i can atleast make money babysitting...which i've done.  And Robert is here, my roommate is here, his girlfriend (fiancee) is here...the other night the 4 of us went out to the tavern- it was not packed on a saturday night and it was a good time.  

I can't believe this will be my last semester here.  My last semester with an obligation to anything!  I love school- and i hate it.  I can't wait to get out, but I'll miss the hell out of it.  Mica is a safe little world among all the other safe little worlds i've surrounded myself with along the way.  What will happen?  I dont know. But I'm not worried at all.  I've got plenty of ideas and plenty of potential destinations come next fall.  

tomorrow i will go to the studio and make something that has nothing to do with school, or my teachers, or my classmate.  something that is beautiful even if only to me."

One day we took a hike in the woods around the cabin and it was like being under a golden blanket.  We were surrounded by fall. 

we spent our days driving through the country, hiking by the river, and relaxing on the front porch, and spent the nights cooking rediculous meals and drinking ourselves to sleep.  Every moment of the trip i would look up and just be grateful.  It was another fall break well spent with beautiful people in beautiful land.

"event","This is my first blong entry Ever, and i feel under pressure to write something profound, or funny, or clever, but instead I am going to try to keep this as honest as possible.  I'm going to write how i think, in fragments that often fail to connect.  So with that said, here is my day=

1. i took a drive by accident and went down the narrow back route from hamden to bolton hill, the air was cold and i had bob dylan singing to me, and it was the first day i pulled out my down vest for the fall (my favorite thing for my favorite season).  The sun was coming through the trees and it looked like a frame from a movie or from a poem with visions of sunrays on an abandoned road...i put my hand out the window and high-fived the air and had one of those moments of complete contentment.

2. thursdays is my day with no class and lots of babysitting.  I watched Nicky who is 1 from 11-4.  at noon we picked up his brother Joe, who is 3, from school. Joe talks very loud and very cute and loves to play games, but cheats until he wins.  His favorite phrase is ""isnt that funny??!""  later, we picked up the third, Gus, who is 5, and it wasnt long before i was on my way back home.  Sitting for them really wears me out, BUT it also makes me feel like an important part in some lives.  I try to show them a good time and it pays off when i see them the next time and they give me a bright smile and a hug. 

3. i have spent this evening cleaning, munching, and reading love letters from a new book that came in the mail yesterday.  jon is coming to visit tomorrow, so i want to make baltimore (and my apartment) look as nice as i can this weekend."

"event","Hello my fellow... err... MORTALS!!! This is my only computer outlet right now is Mr. Colagross' computer. My internet providers haven't done the providing yet. I'm sooo pissed because they said they would do it on Sept 1st and that is the day we moved in and now it's Sept 5 and its still not done!! I'm so pissed because there are people who only reach me on the internet!! It's like totally not fair!! grr!

Next... Yea. I moved. I'm now more north cape coral than cape coral. I like it though because there aren't as many people than where we were. Plus no one goes down the street we're at like 60 mph. Its kid and dog safe! Though we're like out in the middle of no where. That's okay. I probably still have to pick my friends up if they want to come over. They don't know they way to meh house!! -_-;

So.. school... uh... It's Tuesday and I brought money for pizza and there was none. I was like.. uh.. hello! If it happens tomorrow... there's something wrong with that. I think they should've made some kind of announcement saying there will be no pizza on Tuesday!! I mean seriously. The only reason there was that many people in line was because they brought money for pizza and nothing else so they needed something to eat. Now... on the topic of Ms. Whale. She is like... so easily side tracked she's worse than Mrs J. Mrs J was totally awesomest and we still got some learning in so we weren't completely wasting time away. Ms. Rogers just keeps going with the topic wanting to know everyone's opinion on the matter. Like today, we talked about Steve Irwin dying (The ""Crikey"" guy). We talked about that the whole class while doing our Words to Own, but there wasn't that many words that we were busy for long. So we talked about the Crikey guy the whole time after the journal. Which I did with one sentence basically. Yearbook. My theme idea wasn't taken but that is okay. I came up with the cover! BAM BABY! We're doing the iPod thing for the cover. If you can't visualize the yearbook as an iPod then come talk to me I have a sketch. It'll be sooooo cool and everyone pretty much liked it over someone elses idea with a guitar. Sooooo... yea. That is all for now.
Remember, I can only use Colagross' compie til my internet provider starts providing such.

Tuesday i didnt go to school but me and my brother got into an argument and he totally has no clue how much me and my mom care. Then i also found out that i almost got run over for nothing! Wednesday.. let me just say Ms. Rogers is totally insane and a <strike>bitch</strike> WHALE! err it like grr! Now today we had benchmarks and we only did the science and the PSAT. which i stop in the middle of because i was freezing my ass off and i was falling asleep while reading the questions! I cant believe they make you go through that torture just to get into a good college! the only reason people are getting low scores is because they're falling asleep trying to take it.. or they're just really reallly dumb!

Yup. I would say this week totally sucks. Oh plus, one of my best friends boyfriend (who i was friends with also) broke up and now he isn't my friend anymore. He went for some unattractive unflattering sophomore! what a dumbfuck."

"event","So, it's been the first 'week' of school. I guess it would be considered a week, even though we started on Tuesday. So, I found out my classes. Somehow I got into Pre-Cal but I'm going to try it out. I don't want to give up and be like, I could've done that. Plus, if I fail, I always have business math. Though they're saying if you have more than one math and taking that class it's counting as an elective credit and not a math one. Whatever.

Business math has actually been pretty fun so far. We're doing it like a business so we get to bring in stuff and sell it to our class mates and make money and we have to keep a sheet and it's awesomest. I plan on bringing in Donuts if I can get here early enough *coughdadcough* lol. 

Chemistry.. well nothing has really happened yet to say anything about it... so... next.

English III Honors. OMGAWD! Ms. Rogers. The lady from BOston. She is loud, and insane. I do NOT want to be in her class when there is a fire going on. That entire class would be burn alive and dead. She will still have us lined up against the wall and that is where you'll see the bones of the students bodies!!!!!! Geeze-us!

Pre-Calculus, haha. Vitale! He is the coolest teacher I've had so far this year. I made his oh-so-enthusiastic signs at the end of the year last year. So far it's been review and easy. I know it's going to get harder and when it does hopefully Mr. V will be around so I can get some HELP!

American History. Kossmann is hilarious!! So far his lectures have been fun! He keeps it interesting so you dont fall asleep easily. His favorite phrase today. ""Greeeaaaaaat."" *sarcastic hint*

French. I am now Colette. That is my french name. Je m'appelle Colette, et to?
lol.

Multimedia Tech. We have done like nothing so far, but draw and color and a crossword puzzle. That is it. nothing else. Lopez is kind of crazy when it comes to certain things *coughpencilsharpenercough*"

It continued to hurt, and I have an appointment tomorrow to get it fixed and I dont have to wear it today. I'm worried my teeth will move but my bottom teeth weren't that crooked to begin with, i think... i dont know. whatever.

 Today I plan on going up to the school and do the whole uniform thing. I should be there the whole time because i think I'll be helping. Hopefully it's not with money cause i suck at change. I figured this out last year. haha. I'm hoping to see some friends of mine there. I misses them alot!!

And if they get me and the sun goes down into the ground 
And if they get me take this spike to my heart and 
And if they get me and the sun goes down 
And if they get me take this spike and 
You put the spike in my heart 

And if the sun comes up will it tear the skin right off our bones 
And then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks I saw you there 
Someone get me to the doctor, someone get me to a church 
Where they can pump this venom gaping hole 
And you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat 
And if they come and get me 
You put the spike in my heart 

And if they get me and the sun goes down 
And if they get me take this spike and 

[Chorus] 
Can you take this spike? 
Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless 
Night time sky 
Can you take this spike? 
Will it wash away this jet black feeling? 

And now the nightclub set the stage for this they come in pairs she said 
We'll shoot back holy water like cheap whiskey they're always there 
Someone get me to the doctor, and someone call the nurse 
And someone buy me roses, and someone burned the church 
We're hanging out with corpses, and driving in this hearse 
And someone save my soul tonight, please save my soul 

[Chorus] 
Can you take this spike? 
Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless 
Night time sky

Will it wash away this jet black now?

And as these days watch over us tonight

I'll never let them hurt you not tonight 
I'll never let them, I can't forget them 
I'll never let them hurt you, I promise 

Struck down, before our prime 
Before, you got off the floor 
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart? 

Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart? 
(And these thoughts of endless night 
bring us back into the light 
and this venom from my heart) 

Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart? 
(And these thoughts of endless night 
bring us back into the light 
kill this venom from my heart) 

Can you stake me before the sun goes down?

Fatality is like ghosts in snow and you have no idea what you're up against

Then the utility guys came to our house and told us that they have to turn off the power for a couple hours so they can change the pole thats right outside our house so.. yea that was pretty interesting. So we went to my grandmas and i didn't have my make up done so i got to do it there. My brother wanted to go swimming and guess who got stuck taking him down to the pool....! ME! >.<
third time this week, in a row! That boy is KRAZII if he thinks i enjoy sitting there and watching him. I told him I would take him later too... -_-
that should be fun. HAHA! but that's part of my plan! We're going to Rib city tonight and i'm hoping we dont get back in time for him to go swimming. But hey 'hope' is the keyword there. I know. im mean. get over it. XP

That's about the only waiting we did in the beginning. So we got to our seats and no one was next to me for a while and then this is where the <i>fun</i> started. The people who sat next to me were drunks. They were drunk before they got to their seats and they had more beers. So they kept leaving during the game which was fine for me because they took up too much space. They were def rednecks but from New York. My mommy says that there are rednecks up north. Whatever... in the end they got ingaged. We were happy for them. We clapped. and they were cool. They left in like the 7th inning..

There was this cute guy who was like 2 rows behind me. He was def cute. I liked his smile. it was adorable. Though at the beginning i said i wasn't going to be enthusastic about the game that changed after a pepsi. Sugar high, man. The manager told the pitcher to walk this one guy and the bases were loaded and then the next hitter hit a grand slam. I thought that was hilarious and then the pitcher got taken out and some guy in the crowd behind me yelled. ""Keep him in, we like him!"" we all laughed. It was funny. I think that was the interesting/best game ive ever been too.

So i went to a different room and was having an okay time. Then i don't even know what happened and i got these girls calling me 'white ass' and 'ugly' and im being compared to Micheal Jackson. I was like whatever and left into another room and they followed me and booted me out after calling me 'white ass' and shit like that again. I left and it really hurt. They were calling themselves stupid... they were mixed races and they were calling themselves stupid... i mean have some decencey to call yourself smart. It hurt. I'm saddened that our country.. our world is full of these kinds of people calling other people by names because of their race. They bagged on me because i liked rock and that i was white. I was on the brink of crying it hurt so much. The people on this planet need to grow the fuck up and realize that there are other people then them and they do have feelings.

That's alot of gods from millions, billions of years ago. It would've been like my thrid one that week. Maybe my fourth. I lost count. No, it was my fourth. Cause I had two on Tuesday. Next, Did skits in Marketing and that was fun. Went to the computer lab to ""do research"" for out project thing that Ms. Stevens just <i>Had</i> to give us and make it equal <b>TWO</b> test grades. Then in english, I GOT TO BE CAESAR!! yay! thats like.. ""I RULE ROME"" right thurr! 

LUNCH!! omgsh! AMY GOT AN IPOD NANO!! I was so happy for her. It was funny too. Rob had won it in a contest and put it in her lap during third period and she said ""Did you buy this?"" <i>""No""</i> ""Don't lie to me, Rob!"" That was funny. She was hyper and happy all lunch. Also, Rob brought Taco Bell. That was some good Tacos and then me and Amy and Casey went up and got pizza. So I had a good lunch. I didn't eat my poptart.^^

Fourth period, computer lab again and I got onto myspace for a bit. Did nothing on there though. I tried to see if I could get to Foamy.. and I did but the bell rang. 5th period.. omg... that was a blast!! Cards, dirty minds... Cards is a dirty game^^

6th period.. the period i hated the most that day.. ehh.. test. I bombed the last part of it. I forgot how to do it... I looked later and found out I had done it wrong. I did some of the extra credit but i dont think that will make up for six questions. I think I did alright on the rest. I know thats going to be like a 'C' right there... maybe. Then 7th period.. cards again. I played Spades with freshmen named Brain, Dan, and Melissa. That was cool. Me and Melissa (even though she didnt know how to play) beat Brain and Dan like 5 times. It was awesomest.

that was my day.. now if I had gotten a totally awesomest boyfriend that day it would've been like perfect!"

Ugh.. Im happy for my mom that she got a tempt job and everything.. but staying after school for three hours longer is just boring.. I need to bring in my gameboy and play pokemon, fer serious. I caught up on my math homework. The only reason i was behind was cause of a field trip to 'the Pottery Garden' which is Ms. Zeiher's place. She owns that with her mother who is just as nice as Ms. Zeiher. Even then after i got the notes i had no clue how to do the work. I finally figured it out today like right before the quiz which i think i totally passed. Hopefully cause of what Big Bird had said. He got the same quiz as mine. I think... I hope so.. even then I got a glimpse of Kory's.. though.. i dont know if i can trust his answers much. He's smart and all its just his past test and quiz grades weren't so hot. 

 Well, I'm bored... i need to see if i can catch Mrs. Miller to turn in my work before she leaves. If she left already.. then i can do it tomorrow morning or something. Oh and another thing. That auction. I heard that the people who dont even have gateway dollars have to sit there while people auction off the shit. Well.. thats no fun for us.. and its not like we're getting anything so what's the point in us being there!? huh!? there is none!

THAT WAS INSANE! i wonder how he did it... hm... o.O on second thought... no i dont. hahahaha

well skools tomorrow.. and math homework is to be done.. so yea...

"event","I love that quote. I saw it on some kids shirt at my brother's baseball game. Which btw, my brother's team totally needs a new coach. This guy has no fucking clue what he's doing.

I think this is going to be a short entry.
For the past two days, testing has been going on and then skool.
Reading FCAT the periods 5,6, && 7
that testing day me && x-tina were coughing and it was near the end and some girl asked if we could stop coughing as if we could. I was thinking about saying ""well.. if i could.. i would..."" but i didn't. I kept that in my head and tried not coughing.. though it doesn't work too well when it feels like you're choking.

Okay today was math FCAT and periods 1,2, && 3
today was better in the room. It was quiet.. but not outside the room. as x-tina put it ""so much for sleeping.."" XDDD But the test.. it was crazy... like some of the questions didn't even make sense to me. And some i just didn't know how to do it so i guessed. luckily it was multiple choice that i didn't really get. Except for number 11. i just didn't know how to do it. so i put 8 and left it like that. >.<

Also, 4 years ago my cousin, Kyle, died in a car crash. =*( 

So i'm bored.. and going to watch HOUSE m.d.
so yea... im done here..
more testing tomorrow.. and 5,6, && 7"

New topic. i did all my Algebra 2 honors homework. Mrs Miller even was wondering why i havent done any of my work yet. Im a procrastinater. what can i say? So latin is shit. no one uses it anymore so there is no point in learning it except for the language credit. Thou it was funner last year. and alot easier. Latin 2 barely gets Mr. H's attention anyways. so no point there. Baseball team is on a roll! Losing big time. 15-0 and then 9-1 i think. way to go team!

so i think im about done here.
oh the sucking blood thing.. i've now claimed myself as a 'day walker' (a vampire who can walk in the day light without getting burned to death) so there! watch out. i might bite you^^"

okay lets see. Open Mic night was cool. I was so nervous up there that i read my poem like super fast. I dont think anyone heard it. hahaha. Otherwise everything else was god. I was supposed to go 6th but somehow i ended up being 4th. I hate Mrs. Just for doing that. She wanted to get all the students to go first and i think that is BULLSHIT. i wasnt even sure if i would read one or two poems yet! err. On top of that i wasnt sure WHICH poem i was going to read! geezness much! err its like grr! >.<

Christmas is coming. I know one present that i am fo sho getting. The Narnia Books. Well one giant book with all the Narnia books in it. I know b.c i picked it out. And then Christmas eve my mom goes shopping for all the other things that i asked for^^

<u><b>X-mas list</u></b>

Just like so far that i know of everyone hates mrs. major. but i dont hate her. I like her but not as a teacher. She's cool to talk to. I know you think im crazy for saying that but EVERYONE (even a stuffed penguin named pen-gu-in) knows im KRAZZIII!!!!!! so dont try and tell me that i am crazy cause i know this. so my goings on are

Wed. - 1,2, && 3 exams. thats alot. too much thinking in one day. rememeber!!
Thurs.- 4 && 5 exams. graphic design and LATIN! >.<
Fir.- 6 && 7 exams. Math and journalism. yippeE! also Going around Bell tower maybe a movie with christina for her birthday.
Sat.- doing nothing but sleeping in, playing on the compie and then going to barnes and nobles for open mic night. I still have no clue what poems ima read but im sure they'll be good so come check me out!! well..not me...my poetry^^

so thats what i got going on for the next few days. Im in school right now because my mom is picking my brother up first and he gets out at three and i get out at 230. is getting there in 30 mins that hard? i mean seriously. But whatever im not gunna complain to her about it. I already got yelled at yesturday for it and i was only being curious about something but i guess she saw it as me complaing. I really dont care what my mom thinks anymore. I really need to get a car before my birthday or on my birthday so i dont haveta listen to her bitch anymore. Im getting tired of it. anyways.

 This morning I got up and wanted some coffee. it's one of those rare occasions when i'll have coffee caffine in the morning. So i got up and did 1/4 of my morning routine and i went to get myself some coffee. I grabbed MY cup. It's blue and its great for car rides. So i grab my cup and I put it on the counter, picked up the coffee pot and poured the coffee. Now this is where im supposed to say that my coffee was in the cup but NO! The lid was on my cup and the lid filled and HOT FUCKING COFFEE went everywhere including my thumb and three of my knuckles. So..since my hand was burning like crazy i stood at my bathroom's sink for the next 20 minutes. Even then i still had to get my uniform on and shit. I was sooo mad at myself. just grr. My thumb is fine now incase anyone of you are wondering. AND NO IT WASNT A DUMB BLONDE MOMENT

anyways, now my grandma got a new car its a toyota highlander '03 and my mom is getting the Suburu which means...I GET NO CAR WHEN I GET MY LICENSE! YAY! -_-

"event","well for the people who are actually reading, congrats! Anyways, yea i havent updated in a while i guess. I dont know if thats good or not. Im usually on here regulary but never update. Oh well, dont care. So today and last night was interesting. yesturday i went to Wal mart and i saw a New York plate with ""#1 NY fan"" which is number one new york yankee fan. I was like ""OH NO THEY DIDNT!"" then i went on ranting how i was their biggest fan and how i was going to steal that plate. So i did get to buy something at wal-mart but not going to go into much detail about it, i'll just say its christmassy. hahaha.
So i talked to Kevin yesturday. I was really happy about that. We had the most weirdest convo. It was hilarious. It all constisted of Jay and Silent Bob strikes back, rap music, how im psycho-psychic, how my past to days were horrible, what i had bought at wal-mart and a topic me && Muffin(Casey) had on Monday after third period. lol, it was hilarious and full of mature content. So moving on...
Today..um..boring. Did nothing in marketing, wrote a note to muffin in Biology instead of taking notes, Did a vocabulary quiz and went over other quizzes in English, Lunch, did nothing in 4th because i had to go to a different classroom because Ms. Schwartz wasn't here again, Went to make up a quiz and talked to Angelica (new student) in Academic seminar, learned something new in Algebra and had Kory draw me a new gir and payed him to draw me another thing, then i started writing in journalism. This is what it turned out to be:

<u>Into the non-existance</u>
[Intro:]
To be the cursed
the creature of the night
the shadows in the day
lets just say
i dont exist

[verse:]
not noticed
unimportant
not even looked at from across the room
all messed up
nothing to do
just going away and ignoring you

[Chorus:]
into the non-existance
falling through the darkness
just falling out of your memory
landing on my back in reality
so this is what it feels like
to be erased

[verse:]
Invisible
unpredictible
just thrown aside
hiding in my corner
from the fucked up world today

[Chorus]

i dont exist
i dont exist
i dont exist...

anymore

So anyways thats all.
so leave comments if ya reading."

Okay, Friday i wasnt on because right afterschool i went to a concert and i didnt get home til past 12 and i was tired and no one woulda been on anyways because no ones on at midnight!
The cncert was kick-ass. Makeshift Romeo i missed cause of traffic and a FUCKING TRAIN! and then i heard 30 seconds to mars from the line i was in. but i did see Taproot which rocked and the Story of The Year who rocked even more! They did parts of old songs including Sweet Child 'F Mine, We're not gunna take it, and Candyshop. Then it was Staind and do i haveta say anymore! OF COURSE THEY ROCKED!

Today...i woke up at 930 and ate cereal and then then i watched Dogma again. Then i got ready to go to the car wash and i was there until 515 and now here i am. Watching Dogma...again and waiting for dinner. SO now you know why i wasnt on and i think i shouldve said something to everyone so there. =P

"event","Sup peeps? Nuttin much here. I'm just not feeling myself. Today is monday so it's normal right?
Well, I know im sick...i dont think i am i KNOW i am. But i cant stay home unless I have a fever and i dont want to stay home cause i'd be even farther behind then i need to be. Which I am already up to my neck in math make-up homework that i keep procrastinating about. I was gunna do it this past weekend but family caught up with me first. This morning I did NOT want to get up..then again what morning do i ever want to get up??? /sighs/

Next, My mom decided, without my consultation, that she was gunna bring my dog, Dori, back to the pound. I'm probably never gunna forgive her for it. I know for a fact that the way Dori is looking right now..she's probably not gunna get a home. Who would want a dog with mange in their home? It's mutany what my mom is doing. She says that Dori is getting more aggressive when playing with my other dog, Lucky, and that no one is taking care of her, which isnt true, and that we don't have the money to give her the treatment for mange. She says the shelter is full and that no one else would take her. Though I wish she would try harder and see if anyone will take her in before sending her to the pound...

Okay, moving on, I feel empty inside. I know I have great friends and a family that loves me (i think), and i have this GREAT GREAT GREAT guy, but i still don't feel anything. Just today I felt like breaking down and crying when I got home. I don't know what it was/is. It's just there. I hate it. I want it to go away. Then again, I dont want to go to theropy. Not again. I think that's what started this shit. Theropy. My mom sent me to a psycho person in the first place to have someone to talk to so i dont start drugs or whatever. Then I was diagnosed with Depression and was sent to another psycho person to prescribe me 'Happy pills' that i never took and then my mom thought i'd be a good idea to see a family theropist. Hm..not my fucking idea of fun! I HAD TO HAVE A FUCKING REASON FOR CRYING! I'll cry when i want to and i dont need a fucking reason. Goddamn it. /sighs/

Well enough of my complaining. 99x-mas is Dec 2nd and im going! thats about the only good thing thats happened to me this week.

love = sweetness"

today is only friday and im still really upsets. for some reason Friday is always the day that im upset. I dunno, could be PMS? could be anything. my mom doesnt really pay attention to my depression anymore. Maybe she thinks im depressed for attention..I dont know anymore. just sometimes im happy and sometimes im not and people stop asking me if im okay. im prolly not and im most likely not gunna talk about it so dont even bother asking unless you truely care.

I talked to Kevin last night. I was so happy! I hadnt talked to him in like weeks (or it seemed that way). It was really good to talk to him again. To talk to someone who cares. My family is like blah and the only person who listens to me is my cousin, Audrey. Even then i cant always talk to her. It really sucks. But she's coming down for x-mas and im really happy about that. I'll get to talk to her whenever i want for 6 days. Stay up late and open presents the next day. That'll be awesomest!

Today went by somewhat fast. All i did was watch movies...go figure. I had to return Jay and Silent bob Strikes back... :'(

I talked to kevin today we talked for like ever which i love to do that! I cant wait to see him. I also went and got my hair cut and i got some make-up. it was cool! my mom actually asked me what i wanted to do...which was weird. We stayed at my grandmas and she just noticed i dyed my tips black. Go Figure. 
Anyways..thats it...

Anyways comment if ya want. questions or concerns would be cool too...
have a happy long weekend and see you peeps on Monday."

"event","So today is FRIDAY!! once again and im in My graphic design class doing absolutely nothing but updating my journal for all you wonderful peoples to read!!! XD

neways, Okie last night was a horrible night! I was talking with my bestest friend (more like my sister) about her decision between 2 guyzez names Jesus and Steve and she chose Steve, for some reason or another and its like...Jesus was upset i guess and sarcasm was put into play with his messeges and Jessie (my friend) responded with ""i wanna die, he hates me."" and i responded with ""i wish you wouldnt say that and he doesnt hate you hes just upset."" and i guess thats not what she wanted to hear cause she sent me a msg back saying that ""well i do..and did you read the msg Cass he hates me"" when i read that i was like fuck it. SO i typed her back with a whatever, believe what you want, i was only trying to help msg, put my away msgs up sayin that i ran away and took a shower. I was just fed up with her sayin that she wants to die and he being paranoid with people who are upset or angry at her that they hate her. I hate it, but i DONT HATE HER!!! She's soo confuzzing sometimes. When i did get back to the compie i typed up a poem thing in a bulletin and posted it and Jesus and James ressponded to it. (BTW James is her ex, and Jesus is the guy she liked who she thinks hates her). I was actually surprised that anyone answered to it. But im glad they did. I talked to James for like hours and Jesus was an on off convo but we talked about the same thing. He was asking me why she picked Steve and i talked with James about nothingness and I felt better...

By the time i went to bed i was still sad tho...
im still a bit sad now...but ill get over it.
i got to talk with my favoratestness niece/stalker last ngiht TWICE!! I was soo happy! Just talking to her makes me feel better!! XD

I havent seen her today && i hope i will!! I'll prolly add a comment to this sayin that i saw her^^ hahaha

Okie today, I had testing ehh.
Got thro that, went to 1st period, played cards with Rachel AND I WON! oh yea go me! then it was lunch and now im here.

Before lunch tho i was getting touchy feely with a wall. So now i dubbed that wall my ""Friend""
lmfao
IM so stupid sometimes
but now its like an inside joke with me && Casey (not me Matt's ex)

OH Matt && CT broke up!! Im so happy! lalalalala
not to be mean
she broke up with him
cause shes leaving the skool.
oh well..
he was wondering around the hall today.
it was funny
I think this is the longest one yet
and i cant help but notice its

"event","Okie, so today was November 2nd. And it wasnt my most favorable day! everything just decided to happen today...

+ Tiffany left...she doesnt go to GCHS anymore
+ Vocabulary Test today, as always i prolly failed it
+ My brother's birthday was today (i kno thats supposed to be good but it never is for me)
+ I got home late and only had like an hour to talk with Kevin (he still made me feel better)
+ I have Benchmark testing tomorrow and i have no clue what room its in
+ I got homework despite the testing thats going on
+ TIFFANY'S GONE!!
   - if you hadnt noticed me and Tiffany were like really good friends...
   - if you dont know her, your missing out (in my opinion)
   - I was put in charge of her cult (big honor)
       *wish she wasnt leaving at all*

I think the only good things was that
+ I got to talk with Kevin
+ I saw my favoritest Niece Stephanie today and talked with her
+ I talked to my Niece stalker after skool online
+ I got to talk with my Cousin Audrey
+ AUDREY APPROVES OF KEVIN! ^^
+ I got Guns-n-Roses Greatest Hits CD

Even though i had a shitty day, i have almost the same amount of good things happen!
Which is good no matter who says...
Im just glad i laughed before the day was done (after skool)"

Inuyasha, FMA twice, and Cowboy bebop! and i was watching this thing on Comedy central so....yea. That and i was talking to Kevin til like 1 something. I was amazed at how much we could talk and not run out of things to talk about. That's kinda rare to find in a guy....at least....i think so. I got his digits *taunting singing voice* ^-^

IM SO HAPPY! YAY! lmfao

Tomorrow is halloween and tomorrow is skool. Im kinda sad but im kinda happy. Im sad cause i dont wanna wake up early again im soo used to sleeping in and im happy because i wont be COMPLETELY bored during the day. I wonder whats gunna happen in journalism. I didnt have my notebook that had the questions with me so i couldn't e-mail them to mr. colagross, so i dont know. I also haveta get my make up work for thursday.

"event","Its finally friday. My third day babysitting. ::sigh:: My Dogg Dori is just pissing all over the house even after i just let her out. I think she has a bladder problem or something. She has a listening problem too. Shes like 6 months old and its really getting annoying. 

 Chris...hes being an okay babysitee. He's only asking for food. Not to play or anything like that. which is okie cause i have no clue what i could play with him. Also I hurt my wrist yesturday and it still hurts I wrappeded it up to keep it still but you know i hope it gets better before monday. That would be nice. With my luck it wont tho. 

 I got a text for x-tina today. i was glad to hear from her because I was starting to get worried. It seems that she still doesnt have her power back. I feel bad for her. She has nothing to do and not much of real food. 

Why is today seeming so.....boring? I have my power [obviously] and i have tons of stuff here but im still bored. Funny how that works out.

I LOVE KEVIN! loll

well this is the end of this. I believe this is the shortest one yet!

"event","Okie yesturday wasnt that interesting i think...I remember falling off my bed and hurting my knee tho. And i remember getting in trouble for saying 'your face' to my brother. I get in trouble alot for that and..uh...i remember uploading songs onto itunes from most of my cds. I have like 845 songs now. I remember playing the c scale on my guitar that i havent really tounched in a while cause 
I DONT KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT AT ALL AND MY FUCKING DAD WONT TEACH ME!!! Ive tried teaching myself but thats not really working out..i would know how to play something by now....Nothing really significant happened yesturday...

OH! I have like this online stalker on myspace. He msgs me everytime i come on myspace and hes always like ""i need love in all the right places"" and he threatened to kill me yesturday if i didnt come meet him or whatever...i was like ""HOLY SHIT"" i made up some good excuses why i couldnt go see him. I'm like scared of this guy I dont even know!!! agh!

Okie I read this bulletin on Myspace also by Christina one of my friends and it made perfect sense! I was like ""YEA! and YEA!"" I agreeded with every word of it. I laugh every time they say Hurricane Wilma cause of the Flinstones!! HELLO!! and also theres some flu that has the word bird in front of it..which is funny. ""Bird Flu"" are they trying to scare us or make us laugh!? If its really serious than why name it a funny name??? I dont get scientist anymore...Also she got me thinking about this stupid named hurricane ruining Halloween. I would be like super sad if Halloween got cancelled cause this stupid hurricane!! Im gunna be like grr!! Cause this hurricane has stalled like alot! Im getting tired of waiting! err..its like grr!!

MY COUSINS COMING DOWN FOR X MAS!! IM SUPER STOKED!!! loll. She's coming on x-mas eve...shes like my xmas present! ^-^

"event","Today was like the greatest day ever. First I got to wake up later because I wasnt going to skool today because I had a dentist appointment. YAY for me! (a bit of sarcasm there) and then we went to my grandmas..i just kinda sat in the car the whole time so nothing too exciting there. then we went home (we as in mom and i) and stayed for like a few minutes when my mom called me to the kitchen. she told me that instead of getting the class ring that I get a new computer. and compies are way more expensive so of course I choose the compie so now i have a new, totally stellar compie with a flat screen monitor and a really hawt keyboard. And then when i got home it was just kinda lame for a bit. i just kinda chilled a bit and then started moving around compies. My old one (literally old) went to my brother..which i was shocked by...and then i set up my new one. Then i chilled out a whole bunch while my mom did all the networking and wireless internet stuffzez and then i had to get my old pix and music onto this compie so thats what i did for a few hours. Then i downloaded my IM stuffzez and itunes. So now..i have everything i ever needed! Then as if that wasnt enough. my free ipod came. my old one was like broken and kept on freezing so HP sent me a new one. That came today. And then as if that wasnt enough. I got to talk to my oh so favoratest Neice Stephanie online today. AND i found out that my cousin Audrey is coming down for x-mas and she is coming on CHRISTMAS EVE!!!! I just started jumping up and down i was soo happy. 

Okie now to the downsides of today! HURRICANE WILMA. thats a downside in itself. DONT KNOW WHERE SHES HEADING!! and it scares me. last night i didnt sleep because of it. i was wide awake until like....130. Also the original 'Karate Kid' was on and i watched that. Then i just switched it to Inuyasha and then fell asleep before full metal alchemist...which im sad about but i needed to go to sleep. My mom is STILL trying to decide if we should go to the west coast. Im like ""Mom...id feel alot safer if we did."" but she continues to ignore my opinion..not like it ever mattered....Okie another downside..my brother got a compie and he came home and he will be home tomorrow...yip-ee...(sarcasm there too)I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. I missed skool today...i didnt get to see any of my friends...but i got to talk to some people which is good i think....

Well...i think this is the most ive ever typed...but i dunno..ive prolly typed more but not for a journal...oh well...im gunna go to sleep now...its 11 o clock..and Family guy or futurama is on..so there!

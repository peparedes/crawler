"event","Today started off so promising.  Well, kindve at least...

Last night we went to a party in Claremont... it ended up being a high school party.  I felt like the uncool college guy who stoops to high school parties.  In any case, I ended up getting home at 2, and had to wake up at 6 to get to work at 7.  Regardless, though, I thought today would be a fantastic day.  Its funny what your mind can trick you into doing... I woke up quite energized, despite the fact that I had little sleep.  I got some coffee, then went to work where I knew it would be hectic... Superbowl Sunday.  

I tricked myself at work into believing that after work, everything would be okay.  In my mind, everything SHOULD be okay.  So I went home and cleaned up a little bit, then waited for my company.  Two weeks ago I decided to throw a little Superbowl party.  Mari, her friend, and Chachi showed up early.  Then Jason came, followed by Justin, then Meadows, Chris and Ivan.  We left my house before the game ended because we all had tickets to see Straylight Run play at Chain Reaction.

At this point, I was thinking... the day hasnt been so bad. Sure I'm a little sleepy, but I get to see a kick ass show...

Here comes the reality...

I sit here with a glass of Belvedere Vodka trying to calm myself.

Before I continue, let me first state that me and Natalie are nothing but friends.  She knows that I really like her, but I've convinced myself that she doesnt think the same about me.  Even despite other issues and events.  Anyway, I knew that she was going to go to the SLR show with Danielle and one of her friend's, Dylan. I thought nothing of it... 

Now hear me out... I do not want a relationship right now... I just dont.  I think I'm wayyy too young for that stuff, and I have a lot of growing up to do before I can committ myself.  Even so, Natalie is somebody I care about... 

So anyway, we get to the show and we see them and we all say whats up and hang out together as we waited for the show to begin.  As we waited, I noticed that Natalie and Dylan are flirting... and I thought, ""okay, big deal... its all good.""  But then comes the touching and whatnot, and its all right in plain view.  With no regard to who was watching them... I was livid, but I didnt really show it.  I decided to move my way up to the front of the crowd so I wouldnt have to see it.  Why should I have to see it?  With respect to me, somebody that you know likes you a great deal, one would at least TRY to conceal an all out flirting episode.  Sure enough, everybody followed me... I just needed to be alone at that point... alone in my world, at least.  Natalie and Dylan somehow end up behind/to the side of me, in my eye range.  The touching, the flirting, the whathaveyou, begins again... 

At this point I was thinking, what have I done to deserve this? 

Sure, you might not think its a big deal, but put yourself in MY shoes.  What must I be feeling?  It was like a gradual ripping out of the heart.  I was paralyzed in that I couldnt do anything about it.  Crippled knowing there was a blantant disregard for me.  Hurt by what was going on.

I tried playing it off... finally the show ended and Danielle asked me if I was okay.  During the show, Natalie kept asking me what was wrong with me.  My nonverbal response was, ""what the fuck do you think is wrong?!?""

So everybody except Natalie, Dylan, and Danielle headed over to Denny's to eat.  We ended up see the band eating... again.  But still, I couldnt stop thinking about what happened.  I know it shouldnt bug me this much but it is and does...

So I talked to Sonny about it, and he thought everything that had happened was pretty disrespectful.  I mean, even if you dont feel the same way for somebody, dont rub it in their face.  Dont act like I'm invisible...

Honestly, I dont give a fat fuck if Natalie dates some other guy... I really dont care.  Thats her business.  I can very well date another girl... but the only thing I ask is for me not to see it.  I dont want to bear witness to what you do when I'm not there.  Let it happen somewhere else.  Doing it in front of me is NOT COOL.

I thought about it the whole way home... and the reasons why she would do this.... and I'm still empty.  I have to work at 7am, but I cant sleep.  This is something that is really bothering me...

Some people have a blantant disregard for others.  Lucky me, I found one of them... a girl who I thought was so amazing.  Someone I could really get along with.  Albeit, I dont want anything more out of her... and God knows she doesnt want anything else out of me... but respect me.

Its funny because I was talking to a good friend of mine about respect a few days ago... and he was telling me that no matter what, he is ALWAYS respectful to others... and that theres a time for games, a time for being a jerk, and a time for being an all out ass... but its all done within the guidelines of respect.  For once you throw respect out the window, you've got nothing left.  Truly wise words.

I dont know what to say anymore... I just needed to vent.  

Sure, some will think that I'm taking this entirely too far... but put yourself in my shoes.  

So much for peace up...

"event","With all that is happening in the world right now.  The war in Iraq, the presidential elections, the threat of the draft... a lot has been on my mind.  But as I was sitting in my room doing research for a speech I have to deliver today, I found myself reading the Tao Te Ching.

Fall quarter of last year, I had one of the best teachers ever, Kevin Menton.  I learned a lot from him.  He introduced me to the Tao and the writings of Lao Tzu.  It taught be to be more easy going and observant.

Anyway, I was looking for a quote that fits me, and I found one.  But then I found something that we should ALL read.  Something that was written before Christ, yet still has significance today.  When I read it, I thought to myself, why havent we learned from our past mistakes?  

Here, read it for yourself...

I should send that to the White House for the Bush administration to take a look at.

"event","Man!  The past two days have been awesome.

Lets recap...

Yesterday was great.  Me, Alan, Justin, and Sonny went to the Wiltern in LA to watch Straylight Run.  They played with Rooney and Ozma, but we werent too interested in that.  Straylight Run was friggin amazing.  Honestly I've been waiting to see them play since their split with Taking Back Sunday and such.  They did not disappoint.  Michelle Nolan is a hottie.  I took a picture of her.  We took lots of pictures that night.  I'll post them later in this post.  In all, though, the show was pretty okay.  Aside from Straylight Run, the other bands sucked.  Bought a SR t-shirt.  Booya!  Lots of girlies though...

Today I had work, but when I got off I organized a gathering to go to Chain Reaction in Anaheim to see if we could get tickets to see Fall Out Boy, Name Taken, Armor For Sleep, and Bayside.  So I picked up Alan, Sonny, Isaac, and Justin, then dropped off my cousin Leo at my grandmas house.  Then we headed to Anaheim...

Got there, and we couldnt get tickets.  Luckily I asked a few people for some and we came up for 4... we needed 5.  So the boss at CR let Alan buy one ticket.  Cool!  So we got in and man oh man... so many girlies.  But anyway, Bayside blew me away.  They were fantastic.  Armor For Sleep was a band I've heard of, but never heard.  They were pretty spiffy.  I likeded.  Name Taken was sooo good.  They didnt play a few of the songs I wanted them to play, though.  Fall Out Boy, the headliner, was good.  The place was way too hot.  Bear in mind that outside the venue it was about 85 degrees at the time Bayside went on stage.  Plus bodyheat.  It was wayyy too hot.  Its quite evident with the pics I took, too.  You'll see those later in the post...

In all, though, the show was great.  Fall Out Boy, Matchbook Romance, and Taking Back Sunday are going on tour with each other.  Look out for that.

Anyway, without further ado, here are the pics from both nights...

"event","Life has been great as of late...

Been hanging out a lot with Justin and Alan...

On Thursday we went to a show in Azusa that Jennette told me about.  Good times in the parking lot.  Met Cupcake.  The show was cool... horrible singers, but cool.  After the show I was driving slow while Cupcake was behind us, so he passed me up and I passed him up and so forth.  I think he was getting mad, but it was really funny.  Was he mad, Jnizzle?  hahaha!

Friday me, Justin, and Sonny went to Starbucks, then to the AMC 30 where we pondered why young people (younger than us) are getting older a lot more quickly nowadays.  Then Erica called us up and we went to her house to watch The Butterfly Effect.  Alan and Rick came over and we talked and stuff.  Then they left and Isaac came home and we watched the movie.  I love that film.

Saturday...

I'm a little upset about the outcome of this day...

Seriously, what I'm about to write will probably offend you, Sonny.  So if you dont wanna read it then dont, but I need to get this stuff off my chest...

Alrighty... I've been noticing (and I havent been the only one noticing) that Sonny has been acting differently.  Kindve like a girl who's PMSing.  Just being cold... well, not quite cold, just DIFFERENT.  <b>A LOT </b> different.  Not the same person I've been hanging out with since high school.  Definitely a different guy.  And like I said, not only me has noticed these changes...

Well anyway, on Saturday after work I came home and showered and got ready, then went to pick up Justin.  Got Justin, then went to West Covina to pick up some paintballs.  Then to Alan's house to pick him up to go to the party.  Things fell through and Alan couldnt go.  So Rick didnt go either.  So it was just me and Justin, and I was pretty sure Sonny was gonna come with us.

So we called him and he told me that he needed to pick up some paintball stuff from Michael.  I told him he could pick it up from him today (tomorrow, yesterday) and he said no... and that he wanted to drive to the party.  I told him just to come with us...

Okay look, we all know that one drink gets Sonny buzzed, and I knew that there would be a lot of alcohol at the party, so I reassured him that the only way he would be going to the party would be if I drove.  I wasnt gonna drink.  I have the ability to say no to booze... from my experience, Sonny doesnt.  

With that in mind, I was just trying to be a good friend and make sure that one of my best friends didnt go to Rosemead, get drunk (or buzzed or what-have-you) and drive home and get into an accident and die.  To me, I wouldnt be able to live with myself knowing I couldve prevented that.  So I put my foot down... and when I put my foot down I stick to it.  I'm stubborn too, but Sonny was just being a jerk and insisting that he would drive to the party... so I didnt give him directions.

Sure enough, when Erica got to the party, she told me Sonny called her.  Again, later on in the night, Sonny called her again for directions.  She didnt give it to him because she knows his problem when someone offers him a drink.  She told me he got pissed off.  Likewise, when I got to the party, the people who know Sonny asked about him... and I told them the situation, and ALL of them said that I did the right thing.  

You build a reputation of being a person who cant refuse alcohol and you pay the consequences...

What I did was protect a friend.  I dont care how you look at it.  Whether or not Sonny had <B><u>ANY</B></u> desire to drink or not, I could not take that chance.  And I'd expect my friends to do the same for me.

For example, if I were to, the weekend after I got plastered, go out and got drunk, then again the next weekend, I would have built a reputation of being a person who likes to drink.  Right?  So if I insist on driving to a party where there would be HARD liquor, I'd be wrong to drive.  Its just that simple.  And if I was persistant about driving, I'd want my friends to leave me without directions.

Its just common sense.

So anyway, me and Justin had a good time at the party.  Left around 12:45 so I could get some sleep...

Woke up, picked him my cousin Andrew, then came home, called Sonny...

He told me he wasnt going because he got a speeding ticket last night at like 2.  Could this not have been prevented?  Regardless....

Meadows showed up and we went to Alan's.  Picked him up, then went and picked up Rick.  Went to Albertsons, bought some stuff, then headed out to Corona to play some paintball..

It was sooo awesome.  Rick has a good welt on his chest.  Looks like it hurts.  But we all did relatively well.  It was a lot of fun.

Came home, showered, cooked dinner... then talked to Sonny.  Meadows told me he was gonna go to the party tonight at 10, so I wanted to see if Sonny was gonna go early because I didnt wanna go early and be there with just me and Alan and nobody else.  He didnt know when he was gonna go, so I decided to just stay home.  I'm tired anyway...

So we had a talk about last night...

I initiated it by telling him I'm sorry for acting the way I did last night, but it was only to protect him from the propensity of something bad that might occur.  He said it was cool... but in the tone of voice that he used with me when he was pissed off at me because of a past happening.  Something we straightened out awhile ago...

So we were talking and I could tell he was mad at me.  And Sonny, if youre still reading, dont tell me youre not mad because I know you well enough to know that you are.  When we were joking around about blue balls, you were mad... Erica, Isaac, Justin, me... we all knew you were ticked...

I know when he's mad.  Just like I know when my sister is mad, or when I know any of my friends are mad at me.

So he was just giving me the attitude that he has and I was getting mad, but I dont know why he would be so mad at me... it drives me nuts.  Like seriously, you have no idea how upset I am.  Its really bothering me.  I dont like having people mad at me... especially when its for a stupid reason.  

I know I'm an asshole... I know it.  But I try to be good to my friends.  I did nothing wrong.  Honest to God, there are only a handful of people I trust with things... my parents (to a parental extent), my sister, Justin, and Sonny.  Nobody knows me better than them.  Honestly.

So it pisses me off to know that Sonny is acting like this... gemini or not, dont be pissy about stupid problems like these... because I tend to read too much into things, and I take it too far sometimes....

Dont TRY to ruin a friendship, dude.  Because to me, and I know you'll say everything is cool when its not (not to me at least), it seems like youre trying to distance yourself in a way where I wouldnt consider you a friend any longer.

I tried to relieve some pressure by talking to one of my buddies about this... he confirmed that Sonny is acting in the way I decribed above.  I thought it might just be me... and if it was, I'd confess it.  But its not.  

Dude, dont be so cold.  I know youre trying to be, but its only making me not trust a guy who I thought was a good buddy.

Anyway, I feel a lot better.  

I know this will cause a ruckus of some sort.

Sorry, but this needed to come off my chest.

On a better note, I met someone REALLY cool.  She seems like an awesome person.  We'll see what happens.

Anyway, take everything above for what its worth.  I'm prolly gonna regret writing this, but I just needed to.

Take care,
Raul"

Warped Tour was kick ass.  I took some pictures, but not with the digital camera, so I cant post those.  I got sooo burnt though.  We didnt use sunblock.  When I see ""we,"" I mean me, Justin, Sonny, my sister, Meadows, little Autry, Leo, Erica, Isaac, two of their buddies, and the Manahan's.  

Nevertheless, the show kicked so much ass.  Seriously.  Taking Back Sunday got crazy though.  Hung in there.  Hidden in Plain View kicked ass.  Man, it was awesome.

Anyway, today I had work and stuff.  But after work me, Alan, Sonny, Rick, and Justin went to the block in Orange.  It was fun.  We took pictures with a lot of people.  It was sooo funny... and fun.  So without further ado...

"event","Yesterday was so amazingly awesome.  Twas great.  At night me, Jeannette, my sister, Sonny, Michael, Isaac, and Erica went to the Bear Vs. Shark concert.  They played with Gatsbys American Dream and some other kick ass band... just cant remember their name.  

Bear Vs. Shark was incredible.  For those of you who havent listened to their music... you're seriously missing out.  We were right by the stage the whole time.  It was probably one of the best shows I've been to in awhile.

"event","The past few days have been hectic. A lot of running around, a lot of school bullshit, and no time to workout...

Monday I had my first day of summer school. I'm taking the math class that I didnt do so well in... But its a computer math class, and that just doesnt work out well for me. Too much self-direction. I need more instruction.

So anyway, I came home and decided to take another class. Might as well. Its stupid to go to school for one class. So I added a sociology class. It meets Tuesday's from 6-10pm. I also dropped my computer math class, and added a regular class that meets right before my Tuesday class... but also on Thursday. Meh... I'm taking night classes so I can keep my morning shifts at work.

I worked Monday and Tuesday...

Yesterday me, Meadows, Sonny, Mike, Chris, Isaac, and Justin played basketball by Mike's house. The first game was really good. We came from behind and won the game. It was awesome. Then we played by ourselves. Then I wrestled Meadows. Lost 1 Won 1. He's tough.

Came home and slept. 

Today is my day off from everything. But Meadows and Justin are going to Pepsi Smash, and Sonny works. Isaac is working too. So I'm stuck today to do nothing. Unless someone calls me up. 

Have a good one..."

"event","So whats been going on with me?

Not much, actually.  This past week has been sortve mediocre.  Seriously.

I worked about 26 hours this week.  Work has been easy.  I seriously hang out most of the time I am there.  I've found ways to make work enjoyable.  Its cool.  Plus Sonny is working with me now, and its fun...

During the week I did a lot of nothing, but I did work out 5 times this week.  I am happy about that.  Played a lot of video games with my friends from work.  Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is the shit.  Also during the week, me, Justin, Sonny, and Meadows played some basketball.  Isaac showed up later.  That day was fun.  On Friday me and Meadows went to a party.  There were A LOT of girls... but they were not my type.  We left early because I had to work at 6am the next morning...

Yesterday we all went to the movies to see Dodgeball.  That movie is hillarious.  I liked it a lot.  The subtle comedy in there is friggin awesome.  After the movie I came home and chilled with some of my sister's friends.  They were drunk.  I wasnt..

Today for Father's day I was woken up early because my dad is spoiled and he couldnt wait to open his presents.  He's a dork.  So he was all happy with what he got.  I bought him a Johnny Cash box set, and my sister got him the Lakers dvd.  Its cool, we watched some of it.  And my mom bought him a lot of clothes... After that I went to the gym, then we went to my grandma's.  It was boring, yet fun.  Me and my cousin Andrew get along well...

Random notes:

<li>My dad told me if I sell my quad, I can get a Raptor.  Thats AWESOME!
<li>My parents are seriously considering buying another house.
<li>I cant get the idea of owning a venue out of my mind.  I am gonna do it.  Mark my words.
<li>I have to go to summer school, god damnit... I HATE math.  Hate it with a passion.  But I never registered, so I have to go through a long, expensive process tomorrow.
<li>Bear Vs. Shark next Monday at the Knitting Factory.
<li>Warped Tour next week.

Thats it for now..."

"event","This weekend has been grand...

On Friday I took my last final, went to work, went to the gym, then went to Starbucks.  Hung out with Sonny and Meadows all night.  It was fun just talking about stuff.  ""Good times,"" as they say.

Saturday was cuter.  Dressed up all fancy and shit.  Me, Sonny, and Meadows wore suits and ties and stuff and went to the block in Orange.  On the way there we got hit on by hot girls, but we lost them because Meadows hit 110 mph.  Got to the block, met up with Michael and his girlyfriend.  Walked around.  More girls... Meadows said two were looking at me, but fuck that shit.  Left the block like at 10 and came home.  Allen stopped by and dropped off a game he bought me... he's the man.  Chilled with Meadows and Sonny some more.  Then played XBox with Paulo, Mike, and Allen.  It was fun.

Today I woke up and made a few calls, and finally it was settled that we would go to San Diego to have some kick ass Mexican food from my favorite restaurant, then to the beach.  It was me, my sister, Sonny, my sister's friend Jeanette, and my aunt.  I drove.  So we left at like 2 and got there around 3:30.  Ate... yummy.  Then went to the beach.  I have some pictures from the beach...

I like the blurryness... it adds to the effect of being alone in a theatre with Russians and villains with guns against their heads.

More pictures for you people to view.. Uh huh.

Anyway, everything was great today.  We listened to awesome music on the way home.  Too bad the Lakers lost.  Shit.  Must go 7 games.

Tomorrow I work from 9am-3pm.

Have a good one...

"event","Today was okay, I guess...

Woke up and went to school to take my music final.  It was soooo hard.  I failed it for sure, but hopefully I'll maintain my B.  HOPEFULLY.

After school I went to the gym.  I work out good when I'm alone, but I'd rather have a partner.  After the gym I came home and took a shower and got ready in anticipation that I wouldnt have time to shower and get ready later...

Met up with Sonny at Starbucks, then went to Cal Poly for my math final.  Got there at 2:30 to study with the guys.  The final was sooo hard, once again.  I needed 135 points out of 200.  I honestly dont think I got it.  I hope to God I did.  Otherwise I'm going to summer school.  Rushed home, thinking I was going to Knotts, but once I got home my sister told me that Sonny called and told her to tell me they took Mike instead because they couldnt wait for me.  Its cool, I guess.

So I played some video games, then I dropped my sister and her friend off at a kickback.  I didnt wanna go because I didnt wanna drink.  Instead I went to Best Buy.  Talked to Rick for a bit, then I decided to shop.  I ended up buying an iPod.  It was really expensive.  Almost $400, but I've been wanting oen for awhile.  What the hell.

Got home and configured it, then went to pick up my sister.  Blockbuster stop.  Then came home.

Tomorrow I'm going with Isaac to the gym, then to pick up my check... its gonna be big.  Then home to wash my truck.  Then whatever comes up...

I love my iPod.  

P.S.  Please pray for my very good friend Justin.  Pray that he can make it through a tough time he's going through."

Saturday was the Bonus Party Part II for Sonny and my sister.  It was fun.

Sunday I had to work in the morning, which was a bitch because I went to bed at 4.

Monday I had a final for econ.  Hope I did okay.  Went to the Ontario Mills with Meadows, Sonny, Isaac, and Allan.  Then to eat, then to Starbucks, then to my house, then to Isaac's house.  It was a lot of fun.

All that in mind, here are some pictures I took from those days...

My baseball team made the playoffs.  We're going to a tournament for the little league farm division championship.  Should be fun, but I'm gonna miss our first game because I have to work.

Nothing has been going on, really.  Sonny might get a job with me, which would be cool.  Umm... I had a little shindig on Friday night..

Oh yeah... I went to the doctor today because my knee has been killing me.  So I got checked out and the doc told me I have a [insert super long medical term].  He said its from running too much.  Apparently if it doesnt heal right, or for that matter, soon, I'm gonna have to have surgery.  Damn knee.

I played All Star Baseball 2005 and Fight Night 2004 all night tonight.  From 5-11.  Whoa.  I didnt do my homework like I promised myself I would.  I have to write a paper on how a movie relates to politics.  Only two pages, so that should be easy.  But I had a boatload of math homework to do.  He said its not due till Wednesday, but I'd rather turn it in early... I NEED TO PASS THAT CLASS.  

Umm... Friday is Dashboard.  Thats gonna be swell.  Tomorrow we might go to the movies.  So I'm gonna wake up early and write my paper.  I have work from 9-3.  Saturday is the party at my house.  Sunday is the recovery from the party, plus I work from 10-4, and I really wanna go to a truck expo that Isaac was telling me about.

Wednesday I went with Jennette to see Cursive at the Troubadour.  I had never been there before, so I parked where I seen an open parking.  More on that later...

So Mike Park was on when we got there, because we were late.  Jennette got me lost.  Took like almost two hours to get there.  But its cool.  Mike Park was okay.  After him was Saul Williams.  He was impressive.  He's a poet, for those of you who dont know.  He's a brilliant guy.  He crafts words perfectly.  Very cool to listen to.  After him was Cursive.  They were really good.  I hadnt heard much from them before the night, but I got an ear full that night.  They seriously kicked ass.  I have some pics to show you all.  They'll be at the bottom of this entry...

So anyway, after the show, Jennette was joking that my truck would be towed.  So we walked out, and whatdoyaknow... it was towed.  So after a long hiatus, and a trip to Vons, my sister came and picked us up and took me to get my truck.  $233.  OUCH!  

Aside from the towing, I had an superb night.

Friday was Sonny's birfday. <b>HAPPY BIRFDAY SONNY!</b> I had a test in math at 8am, so I had to go to school, but after that class I came home and called Meadows and Chris.  I arranged for them to meet me at Sonny's house where we would ambush the birfday boy.  So they all showed up and we snuck into his room and put makeup on him.  He didnt care much, surprisingly.  So then me and my sis gave him our presents and then we took him to iHOP.  Justin and Jane met up with us.  I ate in a hurry because I had to be back on campus at 11:45.  Didnt get my food until 11:45, but made it back on campus at 12:10 to take a quiz.

After that, I went to the gym, then Sonny and Justin came to my house and we went with my sister to Starbucks and Hollywood Video.  Celina hates me.  Then we bought stuff from Albertsons, then stole a bunch of chips, then drove to Walnut's Albersons and stole like 6 twelve packs of cokes.  It was great.  They just leave the stuff outside the store.  They know its there for the pickin...

Picked up a cake for Sonny, then came to my house where Isaac, Erica, Meadows, Chigga, P-Nut, Manny, and Andrew came by.  We had a little kick back.  It was cool.  Everybody got wasted.  I drank some, but not enough to get buzzed.  Talked to Justin for a long time about stuff.  Then me, Sonny, and Justin had a nice chat.  Then I left and Sonny and Justin talked about things for a long time.  haha... *sigh*

I found out some very interesting factoids.   A lot from Sonny, but something from my sister.  You see, theres a REALLY hot girl who works with her, and I noticed her awhile ago.  She's hot.  And apparently she thinks I'm hot.  AWESOME!  Kickass!

Anyway, I took a lot of pictures today.  I like taking pics of people and stuff.  Its fun.

Yesterday was great.  Me and Sonny worked out at the gym hardcore.  We lifted until we couldnt lift anymore.  It was awesome.  Plus we took protein before, so we're gonna get huge.

"event","Wow, I've had one hell of a busy week.  It was pretty awesome.  I wish every week was like this past one...

<b>Monday:</b> Went to the Steel Train concert.  I've liked Steel Train since I heard them on the first Drive Thru dvd, so me and Sonny decided to go.  Ateravia and Dexter Danger played with them... they were both really good.  You should all listen to them.  I was so impressed.  Steel Train rocked.  The guitar solos were stunning.  Blues at its best... 

Oh yeah!  There was a super hot girl there.  She's stalking us.  She's been at like 3 or 4 of the other concerts we've been to.  SOOO hot.  She touched my leg.... awww...  hopefully I'll see her again.  If I do, I'm gonna talk to her for sure.  So hot!  Seriously.

<b>Tuesday:</b> I had a baseball game and I worked and I tutored at La Puente High.  We won our game... the kids are looking good.  

<b>Wednesday:</b> On Tuesday I spent the night looking on ebay for a ticket for my sister to the Taking Back Sunday concert.  I had one, but only one... and she wanted to go.  So I finally got one, and asked my dad to pick it up for me.  Luckily he said okay.  So he went to Beverly Hills and picked it up.  I paid double the regular price.  So after much delay I gave it to her.  She was so happy.  One of her birthday presents.  Me and my sister are really close.  Thats awesome.  Anyway, me, Chris, Sonny, and my sister went to the show at the House of Blues in Hollywood.  The first band was good, and Jackson United wasnt too hot, but decent.  Taking Back Sunday was sizzling.  Fred is growing on me, but he's no John Nolan . The new songs sounded really good.  I enjoyed the show a bunch.  Drunk girls are stupid.

<b>Thursday:</b> I had to work from 9-3, but after that me, Sonny, and my sister went to the movies.  We watched Troy, Shrek 2, and 13 Going on 30.  All of them were good.

<b>Friday:</b> Me, Sonny, Isaac, and Erica went to a little gig in Glendora.  Met up with Jennette.  First time I saw her in forever.  Her friend Rusty is funny and has a nice voice.  It was awesome.  After the show we went and stole soda then went to eat, then I went home and passed out.  So tired.

<b>Saturday:</b> I woke up and relaxed for awhile.  It was nice doing that.  Havent done that for a long time.  Around 4 I started getting ready to go to prom.  This girl from work asked me to go with her, so I agreed.  She goes to Ramona.  But yeah, went to her house and took some pics.  Her friend is kindve hot.  Anyway, after awhile the limo driver showed up and we all left for the hotel.  I forgot the name of it, but it was on Sunset in Hollywood.  Right past the House of Blues.  It was fun.  There was one hot girl... so hot.  This guy kept looking at me... it was so gross.  This one girl kept looking and smiling at me, but she wasnt my type.  I'm too picky, and yes... too shallow.

After prom we went to a Chinese restaurant.  I wasnt hungry but they were.  So they ate.  I was afraid.  haha.  It was called Won Kok.  Ewwy.  I was exhausted on the way home.  Dunno how I made it home after we got dropped off.  

Went to bed around 2:30, and then...

<b>Sunday:</b> I worked at 8am.  I like mornings.  We hired a lot of new people, so they're all my bitches.  Its so awesome.  I dont have to do much work anymore.  One guy did all my tasks for me.  It was great.  Worked from 8-4:30.  Came home, ate, then went to the gym with Sonny.  Afterwards we went to Starbucks.  After that I came home.  Starbucks is great.

<b>As for next week...</b>

Tomorrow I have school, and a game... plus a kickass workout at the gym.  Its gonna be real intense.  And I'm going to the movies.

Tuesday I have work in the morning, then I'm gonna take my sister out for her birfday.

Wednesday I have school.  Thursday is nothing.  Friday is Sonny's birfday, and I dunno about the weekend.

The song was ""Walk Away"" and it got me thinking about things, and people... and other people who are in tough situations.  I'm gonna post the lyrics... tell me what you think about them, and try to listen to the song as well.

So yeah, let me know what you think...

And (that) means another day without you my friend. 
And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself. 
And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else. 

And it's so hard to do and so easy to say. 
But sometimes - sometimes, 
you just have to walk away - walk away. 

With so many people to love in my life, why do I worry about one? 
But you put the happy in my ness, you put the good times into my fun. 

And it's so hard to do and so easy to say. 
But sometimes - sometimes, 
you just have to walk away - walk away and head for the door. 

We've tried the goodbye so many days. 
We walk in the same direction so that we could never stray. 
They say if you love somebody than you have got to set them free, 
but I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery. 
They say time will make all this go away, 
but it's time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays. 
And once again that rising sun is droppin' on down 
And once again, you my friend, are nowhere to be found. 

And it's so hard to do and so easy to say. 
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away, walk away and head for the door. 
You just walk away - walk away - walk away.

I walk outside and only two of my dogs are there... Hannah and Honey.  Hanz (I call him Hanald), which is my absolute favorite dog in the universe... he means the world to me... he's always been there for me... protected me, loved me, EVERYTHING.... he wasn't coming.  But for the first time, I noticed something on Honey.  Her neck was bulging out.  I came inside and told my parents I was going to the emergency vet.  They told me no, because they know I don't have the money for that stuff.  So, already teary eyed because I knew it wasn't good, I ran outside and looked for Hanald... my dogs like to go under the house for shade, and sometimes they sleep under there... so I was yelling for him, and he wasn't coming.  I thought maybe he got out somehow.  So I looked under the house and seen him.  I was relieved...

So I called him again and he wouldn't come.  Maybe he didn't hear me.  I got on all fours and looked under the house... he wasn't breathing.  I dismantled all the bricks and started balling.  He was dead.  I cry now as I did last night... I went over, punched the wall hysterically, and cried even more.  I cried the whole night, until I fell asleep.

I loved you, Hanz...

Then I woke up and was still crying.  My mom stood home from work... I thought so that we could take Honey to the vet to get checked.

I asked her what time they open... she came over and told me that we don't need the vet.  My dad took Honey to the emergency vet last night when he took Hanz... the doc said she had a massive infection on her neck, and her stomach... she would only live a few days, and would be in pain for much of it.  He recommended the shot to put her to sleep.  My dad obliged.  My mom told me and I cried again and again.

I lost two dogs last night... TWO.  Why does this have to happen?  I don't know why Hanz died.  I cant understand it.  Nothing was wrong with him.  I'm thinking maybe he accidentally choked himself while under the house?  Or maybe poisoning?  They killed a cat a week ago... maybe something to do with that?  I'm searching for answers, and I'm balling.  

There was a point in my life where I really had no friends.  No one I could talk to.  Hanz, even though he was a dog, was a thing I could vent to... and he seemingly understood me.  I babied him so much.  Held him birthday parties... baked for him doggie treats.  He just turned 5... he was too young!

I'm honestly in a state of depression. I miss my doggies.  Honey was his daughter... the only of the 2 batches that we kept.  Great dog.  Loved me immensely.  He always followed me, tried to hug me, obeyed me.. her and Hanz were the best... but now they're only memories... and it hurts to me to think like that.

I dunno what to do...

A very bewildered,
Raul"

"event","So yeah, my life has been pretty dull as of late... here's how my week has been...

Monday I had a baseball game.  The parents from the opposing team were yelling at me because I was having runners steal home and we were up 17-0.  Being the cold-hearted dick I am, I turned and yelled back at them, saying, ""I'm heartless!""  haha.  They kindve shut up after that.  After the game me, Sonny, my sister, my cousin, his friend Jesse, and Meadows went out for a night of wreckless shananigans...

I found out Celina tp'd and forked my house, so we all got together and tpd, spoon, knive, fork, toothpick, shaving cream, and condomized her house.  It was grand.  Then we got Chris really good.  He got mad.  But I mean, whatre ya gonna do?

Anyway, Tuesday I called in sick at work because I had to tutor the kids at La Puente High.  They seem like good kids.  I learned some things from them, and I taught them other fundamentals of English... since I guess I'm ""okay"" at it.  After that I just came home... I think.

Wednesday me and my mom went looking for a new truck for me.  We almost got one too.  Its nice.  Its a white 2004 Chevy Colorado crew cab, sports edition.  Its nice.  Like really nice... and its big!  And if you're hoping I get this truck so I can drive everywhere, well then fuck you!  haha.

Anyway, today I went to work from 9-3  They wanted me to stay and run the butcher block until 9... but thats a 9-9 shift, so I told them no.  On Sunday they want me to stay from 3:30-12:30.  Thats gonna suck.  But its time and a half, because its a Sunday... Oh well...

After work me and Sonny went to the gym, then I came home and did my homework.  Played video games, but thats pretty much it for the rest of the night.

Tomorrow I HAD plans after school, but I dunno whats going on.  We'll see.  I have class at 8, but I really dont wanna go.  I should though.  I have a test in Econ, then a midterm in music... I hope I can play the keyboard okay... and then I'm done.  Hopefully I can get my truck tomorrow... if all goes well.

I've been listening to the Senses Fail cd a lot (the new one)... I have all but two songs.  Its REALLY good.  If you liked the old EP, youre definitely gonna like this one.  It is simply amazing.  If you know me, you know I'm a little hard on bands... especially bands like Matchbook Romance, who are, in my opinion, just corny, and other bands like Sugarcult and MXPX... I'm just picky I guess.  But Senses Fail is ahead of their time, music wise.  Its really good.  Buy it when it comes out.

Umm... anybody want any DVDs?  If so, let me know.

Have a good one..."

Yeah, the past few days have been pretty good.  On Friday I went with Chigga, Manny, Rudy, P-Nizzle, Ray and Heidi to the Dodger game.  It was an awesome game, being that the Dodgers kicked the Expos' ass.  Thrilling.  After the game we went to Ray's house.

Yesterday I worked from 1-7, then went to Hollywood Video to return a movie, then to Starbucks.  I hung out at Starbucks for about an hour or so.  Maybe more.  Then, since I had nothing else to do, I went to the gym.  I had a great workout, I was so proud of myself.  Harr!  But that was pretty much it for Saturday.

Today I have a game, but I also have to umpire a tee-ball game.  So I have to be there by 12:30.

Woke up at 10:45ish... went to the gym.  Damn, I need to stop losing weight.  Blah.  After that I came home and watched my movie.  I have school tomorrow.  Music quiz.  Thats gonna suck.

So I woke up at 10 and went with my parents and sister to visit my uncle in the hospital.  Seriously, its a miracle that he's still alive.  I'd like to thank you all for your prayers.  He's looking A LOT better.  He's talking now!  He was happy to see me and my sister.  I hope, and have confidence, that he will come through this.  Keep praying, please!  

Anyway, after the hospital we went to Bahooka to eat.  Yummy.

Came home, got a haircut, then got ready.  Sonny came over, I burned Big Fish, then C showed up and we all went to see my friend play at the Chino community center...

So we got there and I was like ""woah.""  There was a really hot girl there... but she looked young.  So we watched the first band play, and I must say that they were pretty good.  They're called Light the Fuse.  Anyway, during the intermission between them and Fernando V., C decided to go talk to that girl.  So I was just there and later the girl came up to me and we talked.  Her name is Rinah (pronounced Rinay).  Yummy.  

So I got her number and I'm gonna call her tomorrow.  Hope everything works out.

Fernando V was cool...  I knew some of their songs.  But it was fun.

I'm happy!

Tomorrow I have work and the gym... and homework.

Take care!"

Fatigue has plagued my body.  This is way too much.

Beyond the emotional drainage that has been reeking havok on my inner system, work and school and extracurricular activities have began taking its toll on me.  I really need Thursday to come ASAP...

Today (Wednesday) I have to wake up at 6:30, get to school by 8.  I have nonstop class until 1, then I'm going to the gym from 1:15-2:30.  Shower there.  Go to La Puente High, tutor kids in English until 4, drive to work, change there AGAIN, and work until 11.  This is really too much for me to handle.  I finally get a day off on Thursday, and I'm off until Sunday!  But I've been working a whole lot...

I just got out of work right now, and I've been getting a little over 30 hours a week.  I know you probably think thats a little, but I have a compulsive disorder... I honestly NEED to go to the gym at least 4-5 times a week.  Plus I have school MWF, and I work usually on Tues, Wed, Thurs, Sat, and Sun.  Not to mention I tutor English two days a week.  I havent talked to my family since Friday, in essence.  

Its a lot for me to handle.

Anyway, work was okay.  We had a meeting at Disneyland and it was boring.  Came back to work to find the place in a state of chaos.  Took me and Michelle till 12:15 to get it back in order.  

I'm went with Angie and Brandon to Starbucks to get a coffee.  I'm gonna need it.  I have to do my homework right now.  Hopefully I'll be done by 3.  

Anyway, goodnight for now."

Oh yeah, yesterday was so weird at school.  Normally there are no hot girls whatsoever, but I was walking to Ely to my political science class, and he pointed out a girl.  And wow... she was hot.  I dont approach girls though.  Then there was another girl who had a kickass body and was overly cute, but yet again, I didnt do anything.  Its cool...

Came home, went to the gym.  Did some cardio, then Sonny showed up and asked if I wanted to go to Amat, so I agreed.  Talked to Mr. Young.  He's the man.  Sonny got some scantrons, then we left.  Came home, took a shower, then went to work.

Work was cool.  They hired new people, so I getta  boss them around.  Its awesome.  At work they're gonna start promoting, and my name has been mentioned, so hopefully.  If they ask me to do the deli, I'm not gonna do it.  Fuck that shit.  But a pay raise (even though I just got one) would be cool.  Apparently in the produce section, they make like $12-18 an hour.  Awesome.  I had dinner at work.  A banana and cottage cheese.  Yummy.

Work tomorrow from 3:30-12:30am.  Yucky.

Anyway, I'll update more later."

"event","Yesterday was cool.  I had work from 1-7, but the time went by really fast.  It was kinda slow for a Saturday, but mostly because of the bad weather.

Anyway, got home and won the championship on NBA Live 2004.  I was so stoked.  Then Sonny came by and we went on a journey to find a concert, but we couldnt find it.  Hookah music? lol  Some people are racist nowadays.  haha.

After looking for the concert to no avail, we met up with Meadows, Chris, Michael and his friend.  We watchededed Kill Bill V. 2.  It was so awesome.  I liked the dialect a lot.  Seriously.  

But yeah, I have work again today from 1-7.  Hopefully it goes by fast.  I hate working... I'd rather be doing other things, but it pays me, so I gotta live with it.

Anyway, take care and have a good day"

"event","I just woke up right now.  Actually, I woke up at 5:30 because my dad was in a bad mood and he wanted me to take out the trash.  So to get him off my back, I did.  Then went back to sleep.  Then I woke up with him yelling at my cousin on the answering machine.  Pissy mood.

Anyway, tonight I work from 5-11, and I MIGHT work on Friday from 1:30-7.  Hopefully not though, because me and my buddies are going out.  Perhaps to a club, or maybe just to Universal City Walk.  The codename is: ""Find Girls.""  I'm not desperate... yet... so I'm still gonna be really picky.  I can say the same for Sonny and Meadows as well.  But its gonna be fun.

Also, next month I'm gonna have a big party.  Its a split party for my sister and for Sonny, since their birfdays are so close together.  There'll be bands and stuff.  It should be awesome.

What else is new?  Yesterday I didnt go to music and I hung out with Justin and Jane.  Wer talked for a long time and made fun of ugly people.  How cute is that?

Oh yeah, I'm going to like 5 concerts within the next few months.  Taking Back Sunday, Steel Train, Dashboard, Warped Tour, and Fernando V.

Oh yeah... one of my pet peeves is when people say ""anyways"" instead of ""anyway.""  Please correct this, people.  America will be a much better place to live.

Have a splendid day.

My mom called me and told me I have to get rid of two of my dogs.  I love those dogs...

We got my first dog my freshman year in high school.  Then because he was overly horny, we got him a mate.  Both dogs are full bred German shepherds.  They mated and had a daughter... the only survivor of their first batch together.  I have now had the two female dogs for 3 years.  Two of them are getting sick... but not my first dog.  I have refused for about two years to get rid of two of them... my parents say they just ruin the backyard.  But I cant get rid of them.  They're like my kids.  

So my mom told me I HAVE to take them to the pound, otherwise my dad will just let them go.  I guess I have no choice.  At the pound, at least they have the option of getting adopted by a family.  

I love those dogs.  It hurts to think about them gone."

"event","I havent updated this bad boy in awhile.  I've been semi-busy, I guess.  This is what has been happening...

<b>Big issue</b>.  Me and Celina parted ways last week.  We figured it would be best if we did this.  We were both going our separate ways, and we never had time for each other, so we both decided it would be best to just be friends.  We're both young, and we should experience new people before it gets too late.  Its hard, but its for the best.

About my uncle.  He's doing a lot better now.  Still in the hospital.  Kindve responding now, but the outlook is still pessimistic.  Hoping for the best.

On Friday my parents left for Hawaii...

They left the house to me and my sister, so naturally we had a party on Saturday.  Just a kickback type thing.  Most of my friends came over, and my sisters as well.  Plus some friends from work.  It was cool, from what I remember of it.  I got wasted really bad.  I had too much to drink.  I dont like drinking either, its just that I wanted to see how far it would go... I drank a beer (gross), almost a full bottle of wine, 3 jello shots, almost half a bottle of vodca, two mikes hard drinks, and a shmirnof.  I threw up 3 times and I couldnt walk on my own.  I heard I was pretty bad.

Anyway, school started last week and my classes seem easy, except for math.  

Oh yeah, went to the beach last week with everybody.  It was grand.

What else?  Oh yeah, went to two concerts last week.  Both were awesome.  Went to the Hidden in Plain View/Jenoah/Allister/Never Heard Of It concert on a Friday.  That was soooo cool.  Me and Sonny met the guys from Hidden.  They are kick ass guys.  Then on Sunday I went to the Concert for Compassion.  My Chemical Romance kicked so much tail.  The entire day was fun.  

But yeah...

Umm... oh yeah, Im having a bbq on Wednesday.  If you wanna come on down, give me or somebody that I talk to a call.  

Take care,"

"event","Once again, thank you all for your prayers for my uncle...

He is actually doing a little better, remarkably.  When I thought there was no hope, your prayers helped him to do something miraculous... to give me and my family something to hope for.

He is still seriously sick.  If he comes out of this, he will have a long road to recovery... I just hope he is able to come out of it.  He's a great man with an awesome heart.

Keep praying for him, please.  Me and my family appreciate it...

I told my dad about me asking people to pray for him and he got really happy.  He told me to tell whomever is praying for him thank you.  

Actually, yesterday my dad went to go visit him, and he responded to him.  GREAT SIGN.

So please continue to pray for him.

Thanks a lot!"

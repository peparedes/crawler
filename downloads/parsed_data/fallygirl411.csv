"event","i have so much free time i literally dont know what to do with myself. i really need structure or i get really bored and then i get frusterated that im bored. im not asking for school but whites like 10 hrs a week starting june 8th or whenever does not give me any stucture. there are so many things i want to do but i never get done. i feel like im wasting the day if i sit inside but then its like what should i go frolic in a meadow just to be outside or what the fuck.

need to find something better to do w/time than watch friends, go to the gym, eat, sleep or call people trying to find something to do. summer was so much better when we were kids, no worries and i didnt even know what month or day it was. now its work and this and that. just need to have some fun

saw about a boy tonight. good movie, there was a funny part about killing a duck with bread but overall it was a cute movie i do recomend it."

"event","first off the cruise was amazing. it was so much fun. here is a quick recap:

the plane ride(s) there was hell cuz of my sinus infection therefor making my head feel like a balloon ready to pop and my being dizzy. we got there and the ship was so nice and huge. we had a porthole in our room which was cool. then we went to the top deck and got served and had some fun sailing away. then i felt seasick which, combined with my seasickness, didnt lead to a fun night. i felt so dizzy at dinner but then i was fine. we spent 2 days at sea where we met nice people, and guys. then to st martin for the day so we pretty much drank and hung out at teh beach...then st tomas was wed so the ""fun room"" went on a snorkeing excursion where we swam amongs sea turtles. it was this day when we almost missed the boat and we were running on the dock yelling ""dont leave"" while people cheered us on from the deck. ha scary but funny. then anothrer day at sea then to castaway cay where i got my hair done. it was beautiful, the island not my hair. then we got chaesd out of the water by baracude and sting rays. 

then we left and sailed and went home the next day after waiting in the airport for 6 hours for a flight home, or should i say cinncinati then boston. grr so thats the basic jist. fun times with good people. except for the pop warner young'ns too bad tehy are 12. oh ya and our bathroom door would open everyime we flushed haha what craziness we had a hauntd room. then all the food was awesome adn gormet adn free so we took full adavantage of the situation, ordering room service at 3 in the morning, afther which we had already had room service and a 3 course meal. yum. so is all i can remember for now but the pictures hold more deatil and im surpsired if someone actually reads through this whole speel.
 
im icthy my burn/tan is peeling off. im puertorican. scott wesson drove his car into my front steps. ha

as of now im not going to prom. sweet."

go to that site it has the random trivia on it i was trying to explain.

some highlights:
*Everyday, blinking causes the eye to be closed for about 1/2 hour.
*Your mouth produces up to 1.5 quarts (2 drinking glasses) of saliva each day.
*DIMPLE : a point where the skin is attached to the muscle under it.
*If you toss a penny 10,000 times, it will not be heads 5,000 times, but more like 4,950 times because the head picture weighs more and therefore ends up on the bottom."

i feel blah. going back to school was not fun. see everyone stays up and parties on new years then sleeps all day. then that night, they are so rested that they cant fall asleep so the cycle repeats and you are exhausted the next day. does this make sense to anyone else?

today i just didnt feel like moving, i watched a movie and 3 tv shows. i dont feel like doing my hw and im in a weird funk. i dont feel like moving or functioning. my release tonight was coloring anatomy sheets, ah the skeletal system, that class just makes my life better. anyways im tired and i must attempt to start real homework."

 xmas day was good this year, jsut a bunch of sweaters, clothes and we got a DVD player which was cool. so we all watched shrek and then went to my grandmothers house where we wacthed this show called passions. it isso weird. i thought it was a soap opera normal tyoe but its difffernt. there is this which called tabitha and she has a human doll called timmy. i think timmy is played by a midget with a lisp. see he was a doll brough to life and he talks in teh 3rd person. its so funny, usally he is only in parts of the show but yesterday was a xmas special so it was all about him doing like flashbkacks of other shows. so fuuny. my grandmother was lije ""what the hell is this crap, do u kids think this is funny put on the news"". 

so then we went home adn went to our neigbors house. exchanges gifts then went to another family friends house   for more desserts. i have so many left over treats frm Whites that need to be eaten so please come over and take them. anways i am off to hopefully go to the gym, eat, go to mall, then do something else productive on my vacation. maybe ill watch the new simpsons dvd thing we got. peace"

brittney was the other night. it was wicked fun, though i really dont care if she was a quality preformer becasue it was a cool show and it was entertaining. fun to watch though we were the LAST row of the balcony but hey, it was a good arial view right suz?. and brianne always picks up random older men, like on the T. haha it was funny. then kim fell and hurt her elbow. we laughed. then on the way out i feel on the stairs and jammed my finger in between the railing and my wall and now i have a blood blister or whatever they are called but it hurt a ton. so that was that.

i think that i am starting to like psych myself about stuff. i dont know i dont get it, one sec i feel one way teh other sec im like the exact oppostite. ill jsut have to stay focued on other shit and not wory baout it anymore.

ya half day tomorrow, oh wait. i hafta work from 11:30-7. ya thats right. Whites bakery is a cult. all employees have to work  tomorrow cuz it is the day before thanksgiving. and i can see it now, all the bitchy hingham moms who are pissed cuz their apple pie isnt ready but its are fault they are late to pick up their son at soccer but they are early for us. sweet. and with every single person working tomorroe that means like 20 people behind a counter that barley holds 6. at least i can go late cuz im doing powderpuff. maybe ill tell them it ends at 4...then ill get fired...hmm no loss there..

so my weekend to myslef was nice. sat was the best. after going to the gym i proceded to dance around my house w/music blaring to get another workout. then i dedcided to make a cake for chirstines birthday, and of course ate the batter which made me happy. the play went good. bonding was fun. the senior bonding the last night was sad for teh seniors. i wasnt really because this isnt my big thing. sure they bawled their eyes out here but so did all the field hockey girls after their last game, so in a way its all related and i can understand where they are coming from cuz everytime they said ""drama"" its jsut like inserting ""field hockey"" for me.

i am trying to decide if i should do track or not. the coach is hardcore and im obviolsly not, seeing how i cheat and or skip almost all the workouts like last year with Manganello. damn, go to gym and work or run track....hmmmm..both leave me with options i hate-track and work. what to do, i have a week, but i should already have bern getting in shape..hmmm but then again i dont want to seem like a quitter..

i hate when people accuse you of something and they are wrong but wont listen but still insist they are right though they have no proof.

i jsut found out i hafta writw 3 more essay for applications...die applications. on a happier note o got picked for the hingham journal all scholastic field hockey team..whatever that does. yay. damn people couldnt out my picture in, so it'l be blank above my head sweet. im really thinking about playing in a division 3 college, pretty much dickinson or gettyburg..that is unless i get into Villanova and jsut bag it and do intermurals..we;ll see in march..

ive realized that i am a complete joke to my friends. i have shallow relationships that mean nothing. people i call my friends jsut laugh at me cuz, ""oh its jsut katie"" and she wont care. well ya know what, you can only get poked fun of so many times before dents start to form from the little pokes. everytime someone talks to me its about what i havent done w/them or something that is wrong with me. ya know what, give it up, mind your on fuckin business. maybe im on edge latly but still im trying really hard to find my friends again, but then im just losing them. i have drifted away from others and become closer to a few, but realized that people i call my friends i dont really get along w/and like as people. why do i want to be friends w/a girl who constanly nags me about shit what ""shes jsut kidding"" ya that gets old really fast. what about the ""friend"" who you say hi to or do something nice and tehy either look at you inthe ""fuck you"" face or have the guts to go insult you and say  ""fuck you"". thanks for the support, asshole.and why do i want to be friends w/a girl who never has time for her supposed real friends and thinks she is better than you in more than 1 way, you tell me. so that leaves me with,... ok ya i though so...

and because of this i have leanred to face many problems alone. i'll admit i dont have a best friend, and i havent for 6 years. it turns out my boyfriends always end up being my best friends, but yet i get screwed in teh end when its over and the person who i used to turn to isnt there to listen. and there is no one left to give me real advice, jsut the fake shit you cuold reiterate from cosmo advice. that means nothing.

and the people who are there for you sometimes get sick of it to, so now what?

oh and another thing, if you read this and dont get it, then it wasnt proably for you to get. i get ""hey what were you talking about..was that me/her/him"" etc all teh time, read it. if its that far fetched then it wasnt meant for you to be clarified and i dont feel like explainging myslef to you or anyone who reads this. its that simple"

super homeroom was super. my locker is in east siberia its ok. we are in a desolate location probably not in this time zone. my shirt wad kinda different but hey it was fine. and like we talked about it psych today, today was not like some huge power trip, not that i expected that. honestly today felt like a continuation of junior year. like we had a small break and are back. i almost walked into my spanish room but caught myself. and i also walked down the hallway heading to my old locker. i have many of the same perople in my classes, like psych and eng, but wicked randoms in like history cuz they mix upper standard and adv. so it feel the same. well hopefully thi wont last soon cuz at least the homework load will be lighter...tho not for espanol. arg im the dumbest one in there. we have ms espanol herslef gene eden who has spent 10 months in spain nd it sounds like she has a spanish accent on her english more than and englsh accent on her spanish. peoepl talk and spanish and laugh but i dont get the jokes cuz they speak to fast. so i sit there and pretend.it doesnt help that there are only 10 of us either. aye caramba

so fh was cancled after the lightning. so i went to the gym and worked out being the good athlete i am...i swear i ran w/my 3 says off..

oh haha we had the dare talk adn i made booben ask about oxy-cotin. iheard the freshman started looking at each othere and were scared. haha thats what you get for talking about shit like that around the team, nevermind the coach was right there..anyways

so people though it would be a good idea to go spend one of the last days of summer camping out on an island..so of course like 40 people decide to go. so first we didnt have a ride over..so borbou said he could take us in his boat...hmm it was like 6 feet long and looked like it was gonna tip in the choppy waters. so we were stranded at teh yacht club when i had the brilliant idea of having victora taking us out as far as she could in teh launch and then bobo couls tak us to shore. so we did that. so the night started from there. i missed a series of events but it pretty much involved laura s's getting stabbed and needing stictches, gomez walking into a tree and nix getting bicthed at for no reason. haha our fh team was there..it should be interesting on tues.. wow then there was a harbormaster scare but only cuz sara and ashley's boat was filled w/water. we hear so many rumors...""why did they swim over?"" ""they have hypothermia"" ""they paddled on a surfbaord"" ""ashley schomer was coming here"".

so the keg came and the beer flowed like water. i was so dead having woken up at 8 that morning. i could barely stay awakwe after 3 and the smell of all the beer was making me sick. i had some chats w/people then all the boys got drunk and loud so then me and dave retired to our big tent. nice and warm in my sleeping bag and shared pillow w/dave..and laughing myslef to sleep listening to everyone.

so then we woke up and i wanted to get the hell off the idland and eat. so we went to easter and it was good. u'd think a bunch of teenagers going camping at nught would think to bring food but no. i couldnt decide if i was more tired or hungry. and i decided on hungry..and i was prettty damn tired. so that was that. much mopre stuf happend but i dont have the enerhy to write about it..maybe lauryn will..

happy birthday suzi-18!"

blink was really fun. i didnt like the crowd surfers that kicked and fell on me but hey it was a good time. and it turns out i had an extra ticket cuz 2 stuck together so i had paid for 8 but got 9, and suzi didnt go so i had 2 extra tickets at the show. hmm i still need to figure out how im gonna get the $30 back, i dont think it should ocme out of my pocket cuz nobody could make a decision. then our lady peace was sweet. the place was wicked cool. i was tired but at least i knew 2, no 3 of their songs. it was fun. then mon was prettty much sleeping and field hockey. oh and to all the sophs that think its ""pointless"" to go hmmm ok well see if you make the team. i mean, maybe if more of you came we could do something cool.its not my fault if like 2 of you show and bitch about not doing something productive, so ya theres my 2 cents about that.

then today was pretty much babysit and work. i hate being bored more than anything, again my life story. ahg i wish this summer was fun, well at least it wasnt as bad as last year, but hey it sometimes comes really close to it.

i hate couples who cant stand to be away from each other for more than 12 hours. i mean, we all get sick of even the people we are closest to at some points. i actually think spending too much time together is worse than not enought because by the end of the relationship you will be ready to rip each others heads off, not growing aprart like usual couples. so if u are one of these crazies then i suggest you stop doing it and should be embarrassed for yourself.

i think im an idealist. i try to look for the best in situations. but this just leads me to letdown and frusteration. and when no one sees you view  it sucks. kinda reminds me of a paper i did on the theme of ""expectation vs. reaility"". like you build up something to be so great, but then the effects arent usually as good as what you hoped. this is my life story. i went through a stage awhile ago where i was an idealist, then i went into a realist. now im back at idealist...hmm i see a pattern..

oh ya and i need a best friend. the only ones ive had have either deserted me or..hmm...oh ya deserted me. i think i try to be friendly with lots of differnt people but it ends up screwing me over in the end. i think having a concrete person there to fall back on is key. all girls are either too fickle and/or obsessed with their boyfriends, oh wait that is just my view. and when you really need someone, all they say to you is like fake stuff it sounds like they are reading from a script and dont mean it. like ""why am i coming to you, you said the same thing as __"". either that or they start to talk about themselves and/or their problems. ok thanks you are a good friend i swear. i know giving you side is helping but dont turn this to you. it starts to lose meaning. and i think i have a distance between me and my friends but im not sure why its there, i dont think i put it there.

whatever bye now im tired"

"event","yes tonight was fairly uneventful but im not complaining. i saw some funny shit on tv.

 first, when good pets go bad2. oh my. there were like horses and bulls that atacked people and threw them around almost killing them. there was also a clip of a man dressed up as santagetting attacked by his pet reindeer. after it attacked him, the reindeer had a heart attack and died. and guess what the owner did....ya he ate it and they showed it cooking....yummy...

then there was this weird movie called ""but im a cheerleader"". it was about this girl who her parents sent her to this clinic where they teach gays to be straights. it turns out that the the main girl and her best friends fall in love and run off and kiss a lot. the point was to show how you cant change what u were made to be which was good. some things were a little weird and twisted but hey. i recommend it not because it was a quality movie but after u watch it you are like ""um..what was this movie..."". went over real well when my mom walked in and was like, ""what are u watching, is this porn...""hahahaha

so that was that. maybe tomorrow will be more fun."

"event","today when i was cleaning my room i encountered many things. first and most amusing was my diary. it was started feb of frosh year and went up until last november. wait it only had 2 entires, but anyway. i wrote over 20 pages just about john alone and our breakup. i wrote a list of funny things about our relationship and reread them and i was amused. times were differnt then. i wrote some good stuff and other times i rambled, but all was fun to read. i was so clear that i can remember exactly how i was feeling back then. hmm i should publish it for eng class, id get my first A...

then for the future i added a new entry for now, knowing id look back and do the same. it was about only 9 pages this time cuz i wasnt as detailed but more of like a looking back then present day like the other entry. my hand started to hurt so i stopped.i wish i had wrote more entires to look back on but i hadnt. damn. i have one from elementary school and i was like ""i love craig"" or ""i love darrell"" he looked at me today on the playground. ahhhh those were the day..

the second thing i found was a letter from my parents. at a retreat for communion, they made the parents write a letter to their kids to read during ""quiet prayer time"" about how they love us. i found mine and read it. it was so sweet it made me cry all over again-yes everyone was crying at the retreat even guys- a bonding experience. it was 3 pages long and kinda funny. anyway it was cute and im glad i found it. 

tonight was wiffleball fun at the harbor. i wasnt too bad i got afew hits and only got out once cuz i was taged. oh ya also like molested by nick b so i couldnt get to 2nd base...tramatic, so we made a no molesting rule and i think he broke it again. hahaha .then we went to briget;s to swim. i helped scott and murph make a movie. its funny..if u are in the right mood, like that humor and deaf dumb or blind jk. its random is the best way to describe it.wow this is long im stopping"

"event","wow duely entries in one day. im sick nasty. oh crap its early morning. oh well

today i just chilled at my house and went to hannah's. we watched cinderella. i know its a classic but i hate how sometimes the backround looks fake in old cartoons. its hard to decribe but easy to see.

then we went to bertuccis for dinner. hmmmm rolls are good. my feddicini(?) alfredo was good too. damn i spend all my money on food 

then we went night swimming at my house. it was fun-actually who am i kidding it was freezing and buggy, but yes fun. things are fine but weird. hard to explain, i think there is a cycle i keep going through, buts its weird and i  dont even get it myself. good old school sweet valley and barbie games brought fun to all, ok not all, but the girls. then got a good back massage, have had one of those in awhile and it was good. i want a professional one.(hint hint nudge nudge-my birthday aug 12)"

"event","ya ok first to stop rumors-

yes me and scott broke up last night. im obviosly not going into details in a live journal, but then again if u ask me in person i probably wont either. its kinda surprising when u dont expect it, esp when you are thinking the exact opposite, but hey you need to people to make it work, right? 

but breakups really suck, trust me ive had enough emotional ups and downs for the world. they make u think that u suck, even when u are told you dont. you dont realize it but you lose a whole chunk of your life, its like cutting out like one of your frinds or like a habbit, such as going to school-becaue u've gotten used to it its would be weird not to go if everyone else did-get what im saying? if you dont-think harder.im deep i swear

and i dont like this being the dumpee all my life either. i mean i get the shaft for being so nice and willing and trying to do good but i get stomped on everytime. but wait why should i worry, ""its not me it you"" ya ok then why do i end up with all the shit, then it is about me i think. hmmm..makes perfect sense. why cant once in my life can i just feel what its like to dump someone-oh ya because i never want to know that feeling either...

ok now that emotionally exhausted you im done.

**p.s Scott dont read this**"

She falls apart by herself
No ones there to talk or understand

Finds herself, opens the door inside

Hold, hold you but your going away
Runaway runaway (background: runaway runaway)
(Want) Hold (Want) you tomorrow but your leaving today
You walk along by yourself
There's no sound, nothing is changing
Been gone away, left you there
Emptiness is nothing you can't share
All those words that hurt you
More than you would let it show
Comes apart, by yourself
All is well and everything is wasted

Any sound of me again it's time away surround around a friend

"event","i cant express enought the joy i have not being in school. well lets see...

ive been to the beach a lot in the past few days and im sick of it. dont want to overdo it in the beginging. 

never can overdo my pool though-it never has scratchy sand or cool water that stings your ankels. u have a bathroom near by and it doenst cost to park and itnt agravating having to wait/meet up with people. im so sick of things. im not one to have organization but chasing people around in cars w/cell phones is ridiculous. we never get anything done good-we spread ourselves to thin. 

just like ms gordan hates..ah boy i should start to get ready for that. god damn its too hot to run-i love it tho.

ok im off now to get my rest"

"event","yaya no more school for months! im so happy not to see worrells pregnant face anymore (until i have her in the fall...damn). no more hard homework or physics notecards. im so happy

today was pretty fun. we to the beach, or should i say the desolate nantasket beach in the middle of nowhere and we parked in a temple. oh well quiet and we didnt hafta pay so i was happy. got a little burned. i burned the back of my legs and that is the worst. my butt burned too. only right where the suit met my skin not the whole thing but it is a funny contrast between bright white and flaming red. hahahah

the rest of the day was pretty much hanging out with the guys. oh ya the police are the devil and they follow you around...beware they know where you go at night and shine you with their flashlight. pretty scary esp when you arent expecting it. oh well funny things to look back on when we are older, or maybe even tomorrow. 

im sick of people. it was a LONG day and i need peace and quiet so night"

"event","yes it was a good time had by all. excpet maybe the annoying girl in the yellow shirt that tripped and had beer poured on her and was caked with mud....but who the fuck was she anyway? no one knew her. oh well

i also heard there was random bitching out and crying incidents that happened but i dont know why. i hate emotional drunks-""you hare me.."" blah blah shut up

ya so it was fun. it was very hot and sandy-those are the 2 best words to describe the parking lot. some people absolutly died and that is no fun because i hope i am never the girl laying on the ground with dirt caked on me and making gargling noises cuz i cant talk right, (image from last year concert) because i was so drunk at like 1pm. 

the concert itself was disapointing. i wanted to hear crash and they didnt play it of all songs. it was still worth going just to hear them live because the are good live. i just dont like the 30 min instrumentals in between words because i forgot that lie in our graves was playing because the time between words got ridiculous. arg. at least i could stand up this year in the concert. oh well

Congrats girls lax on state champs. you rule

finals suck, but guess what-who the fuck cares. we are out tomorrow in less than 12 hours. wahoo.
ya summer. 

gotta study english-havent looked at it yet-opps"

I started a new job at Mercury Insurance two weeks ago today. It rocks my cock so hard! I love this frickin job! It's such a cake walk and the people here are really nice and the money is SOOOO much better! lol So, to celebrate my new job, I went out and bought a new car. =) I got a 2006 Scion tC. It's black and so awesome I wanna cry! I put my subwoofers in it and they're pretty nice, but, I need to buy a new head unit. The factory one just ain't cutting it at ALL! heh 
 
I haven't done much since getting back from vaca in July.... I go out sometimes and drink a lil here and there, but that's about it. Llama and I started a new bet. Neither one of us can have sex or masturbate again until we are down to 170 lbs. the conditions of the bet are that if she fails, she has to announce to the whole world that I give way better head than she does and I'm tighter, as well as pay for everything we do from now on without bitching about it. If I lose, I have to move in with her when she buys the house. 

I ain't worried about loosing one bit. lol In two weeks of working here, I'm already down 15 pounds and she's gaining. lol I take stairs all day long and I've been eating really well so far, and she hasn't.... So, we'll see. Plus, sex, not happening anyway. I'm waiting til marriage. =) 

anyways, I'll write more later. Just had some time at work because I finished my test first. Today's the last day of training and tomorrow we start on the mentoring stuff on the phones. fun fun....

Later kiddies!

Jase."

"event","Went to bricktown 54 last night. 
So over straight clubs.
This one wasn't so bad, good atmosphere, hot guys, but again, straight club. 
I'm starting to look into a school in orlando, and may be moving there at the beginning of the year. I had a pretty big realization yesterday about the sort of thing I could see myself doing for the rest of my life and didn't know why I didn't see it before, so, now I'm looking at schools to see what's the what yo. I'm so not gonna say what it is I wanna do though, had enough ridicule this week for it. It's cool though, makes me wanna do it that much more. =) 
I'm dying for sleep. Ever since I got back from Vaca, I haven't had a good night of rest. 
Oh, and I'm bombing my room right now. And getting quotes to replace the window in my room. I'm so tired of bugs getting in through the window because the seals are completely gone and the window won't close all the way. I had a major battle with the godzilla of all cockroaches this morning. I'm getting ready for work and I'm sitting on the bed putting on my shoes, when I hear my bag rattling. *side note, This is a bag I got when I was in New York and bought some awesome clothes, so, I WANTED to keep it as a nice souvenier. Anyways, So I hear the bag rattling around and get up to check why it was doing it and it was moving all around, like noticeably. So I'm thinking my little Sh*t rat dog has gotten into my room and is messing around, so, I walk closer.... And suddenly the bag like moves across the floor and the next thing I know, I see the big godzilla cockroach stomping around on the outside of the bag now, breathing fire breath and stomping on new york bag city. I was so disgusted I started screaming and jumping around like a little girl, and ran to get the bug spray. It took me so long to find it I was afraid godzilla would be gone and be nesting somewhere in my room unseen.... but when I got back, it was just chillin there, lookin like it was gettin some sun. So, I sprayed. 
And I sprayed.
Nothing. 
So I sprayed some more. Suddenly, Godzilla turns to me and begins CHARGING at me. I just gave up and squashed it with my pretty shoes that now are in the garbage because there's icky godzilla remains all over them. 
So, the moral of the story was that now I am bug bombing my room while I'm at work because that CAN NOT happen again. Like, ew. 
Ok homeys, that's my words for the day. Peace like monkey grease."

"event","So last night, I had a dream about Joey... and it was really odd and I can't remember a lot of it.... Somehow, we were somewhere and we ran into each other... and he was hostile as always, but we hung out anyway because we hadn't seen each other in a long time. For whatever reason, he was upset and sad, and I made him come stay at my house for the night and watch movies. At some point he started crying and I hugged him and he grabbed on so tight... and I just held him there until we fell asleep, tangled up in each other, like we always used to do. It was such a weird weird weird dream and ever since I woke up, I haven't been able stop thinking about him.... So, grrrr, I hate ex boyfriends. Maybe it's my mind playing subconscious distraction so that I don't think about today being my brother's birthday.... I dunno, but, it was one weird ass dream! Just thought I pop out an entry about it for the hell of it. =)

That should be fun.... in the not, sense. I hate these stupid work functions, but, sadly I have to go. I spent last night at Catina's watching movies and sleeping on the world' most uncomfortable futon in the world. Oh my god.... lol So yeah, that's about where I'm at. Sad, lonely, and pathetic. But finally driving the car I want. I just put $1000 into my stereo system. Yay tax return! I'm so happy! Now I can do the real work I need to do on it... Oh well, gettin gone now.

"event","So I guess I'm not going to maine now.... I called Kevin last night because I hadn't heard from him in a few days, and felt like talking to him. Aparently I sounded all serious and stuff because he called back a few times to see what was wrong, but, I just wanted to talk to him. lol 
Well, this morning, he came on here and read my livejournal. My last post, I spoke about how I didn't feel the same way he did, and I was scared about going up there, and all this other stuff. So, he concluded that it would not be a good idea for me to come up there anymore... Which I kind of agree with... I know it would be a bad idea for me to come up there because one way or another, someone would get hurt and that's not fair... But I was actually starting to like the idea of trying not to worry about that and just having fun with my friend. I really wanted to go up there and spend the time with him and see him, but, Oh well now.... I don't know if he's going to read this, and I don't really care. If you do read this, just know this isn't my way of telling you what's going on. This is my way of getting my thoughts out of my head. I'm sorry if what I was thinking at the moment wasn't what you wanted to hear, but that's why it's my journal. Yeah, it's public on the internet, but not intended for use as a medium to my emotions. 
Oh well... now my thought track is gone.... I'm gonna go back to work and have the fun of telling my boss all the trial mumbo jumbo was for nothing. Maybe I'll justkeep the days off for the heck of it.... I need a vaca... heh

I have to go down and go tanning today because I feel uber white... I haven't gotten to go as much as I would have liked to... 
And all this stuff with Kevin has gotten me a little more worried... I know he's hoping for something to come out of this trip, and I know nothing will... And I'm starting to wonder if I should go or not because I do not want to lead him on and hurt him.... But he keeps making me promise that I won't back out of this trip. That I won't cancel on him on his birthday. I dunno.... I don't know what I'm doing anymore.... I wish I did. Life would be so much easier if I had even the slightest idea.... Oh well...

"event","So here I am, at work again, contemplating what to write.... Nothing exciting goes on anymore, and I doubt it ever will. I spent most the weekend at Llama's due to the Hurricany goodness of the time. The entire complex was flooded all weekend so I couldn't go home until about 4:00pm yesterday. It was devestating me because there was like no food at her house, but there was at my house. :-( Oh well.... 
So, three weeks till my trip to maine and new york. Kevin is flying me up there for his birthday for the weekend. I plan to have fun, as much as I can anyway.... I'm scared about it. I'm scared that maybe my feelings for him aren't what they used to be and maybe his are. I'm scared that if I go up there and spend this great weekend with him, that I won't wanna go home. I'm scared that I may want to, but he won't.... And I'm scared to hurt him if my feelings aren't the same... I dunno... But I still want to go to see him and spend time with him because we never got to do that here.... It got so intense so fast that I got scared and pulled away. I just... don't want this to be a bad experience and I don't want it to end wrong.... 
I don't know.... I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Everything is so different anymore.... Llama and I looked through our high school yearbook this weekend.... That was uber depressing. Everytime I flipped a page there was another person I was friends with. I actually stopped and counted it out, and I basically had over 400 people that I was friends with or social with my senior year of high school. And I look at my life now... I have Llama and Panda, sometimes. Other than that, nada. I don't like that... I don't like that if I fight with Llama I'm screwed and stuck at home. Life sucks. Oh well... I'm gonna get back to work now, so, maybe I'll try and write more later. Peace kids.

Anyways... I'm at work... I'm growing a beard. I thought I would try and rock the manly look for a few.... Who knows if it'll take... 
I'm going tanning after work today. I haven't gone since last friday. I feel so white. White is no good. I have to look like some kind of minority besides the gay thing.... heh

Everytime I think I have something under control, something happens and it all goes to shit and I have to start all over again. Oh well. 
Work sucks anymore... I'm not happy with my job. I find myself going home most days and keeping to myself. I tend to just wanna be home and do not much of anything else... On some occassions I go out with Jesse, but not really that often anymore and that's about it.... I just... don't want much else right now. I just wanna be by myself completely. I'm not ready for all the complications of it all... 
I have completely given up on dating. I figure it's just not for me anymore... like Buffy said....

I give up on boys.
I give up on friends.
I give up on social lives. 
I give up on sleeping. 
I give up on leaving the house.
well... maybe for work.
I'm gonna throw my ass head first into work and nothing else... I'm getting a part time job that will suck up all my free time so I can save mad money for a new car. 
I don't have much else to do... 
I had a wicked bad conversation with Joey last night... He wasn't so much the bad part, just... the emotion outlet part was bad... pretty much left me to conclude I give up. 
I apparently fucked that boy up a thousand times worse than I thought. 
And not just him, it seems. 
I've been getting assaulted by my ex's randomly for a few weeks now and they all agree that I'm a severe ass. 
So, like I said, I give up. I've been without dating or sex or any of the above since February now. 
Blah.
That's like world record for me. 
So yeah... I just give up.... I can't even be a good friend well. I'm an ass to all of them . 
I'm just an ass period. 
So, I give up. I'm not meant to have friends or reltionships or anything at all. I'm meant to be old bitter and alone. 
I think it's a look I could rock so hard....

"event","So... last night... Jessie came by to annoy and harrass me like usual, and we got into this talk about relationships and such.... We talked about how she's bored with it all and blah blah blah... and I talked about how I'm completely done with it. My exact response was something like, ""I don't need sex or a boyfriend, or anything. All I need is to masturbate several times a day and to play the sims, and I'll be set."" And she had quite the little giggle fest over that.... and so then she jinxed me hardcore.... ""Just when you have given up and aren't really looking anymore, that's when it'll find you.""
So what happens? I go back inside to sit at my computer on gay.com, marveling the studpidity of everyone else in there... and then in pops Jeff. 
Jeff... the only guy that I ever regret anything about... the only guy I was crazy in love with, but never had the chance to do anything about it.... 
Yeah, him. Catina knows who I'm talkin about.... 
Anyways, so in he comes and I'm just sitting there, going ""oh fuck! Oh fuck! Oh fuck!"" to myself.... and eventually, I get up the nerve to talk to him.... 
The last time we talked, he got VERY angry with me and stormed off and we haven't said a word to each other since. 
So I messaged him and was like, ""I know you probably won't respond to this, and that's ok, but I still wanted to say hi to you and let you know I still worry about you...."" 
And then he replied.... and I was shocked as hell... We made boring chit chat for a few, the basic, how ya been, whatcha been up to, blah blah blah.
Then out of nowhere.....
""I miss you.""
I didn't know what to say to that and it just grew from there.... 
So, in the meantime.... we're starting over with each other and taking it slow. I'm gonna call him today after work.... 
I don't even know what to say to him right now... I was madly in love with this kid... but I wasn't ready for him before, so I fucked up.... And I doubt I'm really ready now, but... I'm not gonna let myself fuck up again, dammit. 
Oh well... on other fronts, six days now. 21 is just round the corner... and my brother is starting on my car today.... 
I told Jessie last night that I'm not driving for my birthday, since I plan to be trashed out of my mind... and she won't drive her car out there. She was like, I'll drive your car, but I'm not taking mine out there. I was like, fuck no. I'm not having my car out there either because if I get drunk.... I will be a fucking asshole about someone driving my car. I don't let ANYONE drive my car. I let Jessie drive when it was my mom's car, I didn't care. But it's MINE now, in my name, my insurance, my headache. No one fuckin drives it but me, and if they do, they're damn lucky(CATINA). =P
So yeah.... Who knows... I was like, I'm not driving, my car is not going out there, and if no one else is driving me for my BIRTHDAY, then I won't go. Period. I WILL get beyond plastered for my birthday and I will NOT drive my car, or have my car within my access when that happens. So, if it won't be at the bar, I have no problem drinking at home. =) 
Oh well... I'm headin out to do work now. Later kids.
Jay."

------------------------
Which is closer to perfection the male or the female body? ((even though I love boys, the female body is way more beautiful. Less hair(usually) and no funny dangly parts. Unless it's my grandma whose boobs count as tire swings in the park... hehe))

Do you feel Art has heavily influenced who you are? ((Yes. A lot about my personality I've picked up from shows I loved with characters I grew to love. I.E. Buffy... I could totally write the scripts myself just based off my personality. lol ))

"event","So my weekend was long and interesting... lol 
Friday, after work, Catina and I went and worked out, which was way faboo... Then we went and got pretty and went out to Chambers. John was supposed to go with his friend Patrick, and apparently did, but forgot his phone, so, couldn't call me and we never saw each other.... It was like ex boyfriend night again. I saw a few of them. Avoided them all well. lol 

Me and Catina went, and her friend whose name I suddenly cannot remember.... We were there for a while and had a good time.... danced like mofo's, people watched, drooled over the strippers..... Then headed out. We went to take her friend home and oh my god.... I live in st pete. Her friend lives in Shore Acres. Not really that far from me. BUT, this chick lives in like BFE shore acres.... I'm talking like all the way back, four rights and seven lefts three bridges and a lake down there. lol So, getting there, not bad at all. Leaving.... I attempted to do it on my own. So, Catina laid down to nap because she was tired.... 
OH
MY
GOD....
I had no idea one neighborhood in St Pete could be so frickin big! I got majorly lost like, big time... I ended up on the same street three times by going COMPLETELY different ways. Every road in there winds and bends and goes on forever.... and like, there's only one road that takes me back to fourth street, where I need to go..... Could I find it? Nope. The streets are all names and not numbers like the rest of st pete and pinellas park.... It was so bad.... I drove around for like 45 minutes trying to find my five minutes ride home. lol 
Anyways.... so after all that, we went to my house and crashed... Catina spent the night.... we watched movies the next day and completely vegged out and played sims on the computer and stuff like that... Saturday night we rented more movies and games and got junk food and were just dorks. We rented the sims bustin out for x-box.... or so we thought. They had the playstation 2 game in the wrong section and neither one of us realized it till we were home and the store was closed. So, we ended up just watching movies.... We watched Club dread.... which was like the funniest attempt at a B-movie I have ever seen. lol Rent it and enjoy it, seriously..... 
So then Catina spent the night again, and the next day we lounged around more and then I took her home later on in the afternoon. 
so yeah... it was fun just layin around not doing anything productive. lol 
Saturday, my brother came up with his girlfriend and his kids to show us the new car he bought for his girlfriend. 
My brother makes MAD money, like, oh my god money. And his girlfriend is pretty much a stay at home mom.... He has a dodge ram that eats gas like a mofo.... so it's costing like 80 dollars a week in gas for them to share the truck... so, he went out and bought her a new civic. (rat bastard son of a bitch choulda bought me one! grrrrrr!) So they came up to show it off... it was nice... Not the one I woulda picked out though. 
But, she has to make the payments on it or else he'll either take it back, or give it to me. lol 
Good times..... The civic I have now is a car she had that she couldn't afford the payments for when she stopped working. So, I took it over and now it's mine. The same will probably happen here too... lol 
Oh well... so this weekend is Dashboard in Orlando... I can't wait.... I also have to take my car down to my brother at some point so he can paint it for me. He's gonna have it all next week and the week after, when I go on Vacation. So, it better look frickin fabulous! 
Ok well, I'm done writing my novel now.... later kids. lol

***** June Twenty-Eighth*****

The Day of Emotional Stimulation

Those born on June 28th generally put emotion before reason, and their approach to matters is direct and immediate. They make a most universal appeal to their co-workers, friends or family, a large part of which is the humor and cajoling they employ. Since humor is a superior way to reach peeople, they usually succeed in making an impression.
June 28 people have a way of moving others to react to them emotionally, and may in fact be deliberately provocative when trying to garner attention. The shock value they elicit is considerable and those who know them sooner or later come to expect almost anything. Although they may appear highly spontaneous due to their antics, most of what they do is well thought out beforehand. Indedd, those born on this day are masters at anticipating the effect they will produce.
Generally June 28 people eschew patient, subtle persuasion in favor of an all-out frontal attack. Yet, they are so proficient at what they do and so masterful in their detailed planning, that they rarely misjudge their audience or target group. Those born on this day tend to be more extroverted than introverted, but nontheless are deep, complex individuals who are not easily understood.
Many June 28 people are leaders and movers in their family circle or social group. As employees they can tuck themselves away for a time in a quiet place and work unnassumingly but if they sense an opportunity to share a funny story or make and outrageous comment they will tend to go for it. Logical thinking is not their forte, however, and it is more often their consistent work ethic or inspiration that makes them good employees. But for those born on this day, diligence at work does not neccissarily mean order at home, and personal areas of their life(love, housework, raising children, keeping appointments, etc.) may be quite chaotic, even completely out of hand. 
Probably the worst punishment for June 28 people is to go unappreciated or ignored. Some born on this day gyrate back and forth between an intensely social need for interaction and appreciation on the one hand and the urge to be alone with their eccentricities on the other. Mates and children of such June 28 people must either have a great sense of humor and loads of tolerance or perhaps blind love to put up with them.
Those born on June 28 often display a great objective interest in people. Because they are fascinated with human characteristics(particularly those of children), they may become taken by studies of behavior, history, language or anthropology. In this respect they can make excellent psychologists who offer insight into people's motivations, thoughts and actions. In their circle they are often consulted where a matter of human nature is concerned but may not be taken seriously by everyone due to their habit of putting people on. Behind the jovial facade, however, a June 28 person is most often hypersensitive and serious. 

Numbers and Planets

Those born on the 28th of the month are ruled by the number 1(2+8=10, 1+0=1), and by the sun. Those ruled by the number 1 are highly individual, of a definite viewpoint and eager to rise to the top. Because June 28 people are, as mentioned, strongly dominant types, they must beware of being driven by their power urges or drowning others out in a flood of emotion(emphasized by the influence of the moon, Cancer's ruler). The Sun carries in its symbolism strong creative energy and fire, which should be kept floing steadily rather than allowed to sporadically flare out of control.

Tarot

The 1st card of the Major Arcana is The Magician, who symbolizes intellect, communication, information, as well as magic. Over his head is an infinity symbol, which in some Tarot decks takes the form of a hat, in other a halo. Many interpretations may be drawn, one of which is that the Magician recognizes the cyclical and unending nature of life and is empowered by this understanding. The positive traits suggested by this first card include diplomatic skill and shrewdness but, negatively, lack of scruples and opportunism. The choice rests with June 28th people whether to use their charismatic qualities for moral or immoral ends. 

Health(my favorite section)

June 28 people truly like to eat and often suffer problems with their weight. Thei flamboyant nature can lead them to think of meals as events, focusing on the delight of the meal and the company rather than the nutritional content. This can create all sorts of digestice problems, including those of the stomach, liver, gall bladder and intestines. Those born on this day have a higher than normal incidence of addiction and would be better off avoiding experimentation with chemical sunstances. Liver problems here tend to accompany excess alcohol consumption. Regular physical exercise of a vigorous sort is recommended for June 28 people who too often exercise in bed and leave it at that.

Advice

Being the center of attention is fun, but we all have to grow up sooner or later. Work on your destructive side. Find a way to hold your tongue when necessary, while maintaining your fine sense of humor.



That's it folks. If you read all that, then you are JUST as bored as I was to be writing it all. lol But yeah, so that's me. It's a perfect description.... Scary as hell, but right on. I'm gonna go run to find some of my friend's descriptions. Later all. =)

"event","Ahhh... I love when I go days and weeks without posting... makes posting so much more fun! 
So I am at work right now, just got here... not ready to work yet, so, just relaxin. lol The new president of our company is coming today and we all get to have meetings with him for him to introduce himself. Hopefully he's as nice and as good of a president as Kelly was. 
Last night I went over to John's house... 
As a re-cap, because I know I haven't mentioned him before.... John is a guy I just met recently. We were both in gay.com, bored as hell, and ended up talking. Till three in the morning. We bonded over our love of Dashboard confessional. hehehe. So anyways, this past Friday we ended up meeting up and hanging out.... We went out for coffee and then went to this bar he likes going to to play darts. That was fun... it was a little rinky dink bar that was kinda cute. Totally a gay bar. lol There was a little kiosk outside where this beefy bartender was taking care of everyone. He was really cute! lol I don't remember what we were talking about, but all of a sudden, he was like,""I can smell a power bottom from a mile away sweetheart."" At first I was like, no, me? Only because I wasn't ready for John to know that much.... But then I was like, whatever. And he kept goin on about it till finally I was like, yeah, I am a power bottom and I've probably had more dick up my ass than you've seen in your whole life. 
He liked that one... didn't have much to say back to that. Come to find, he also has a tongue ring fetish, which, both John and I have. (Mine's bigger though. ;P) So anyways, as we're getting ready to leave, John's a little tipsy and the bartender kisses him to play with the ring. John didn't know what to do because the guy could crush us both. lol Then he asked about trying my tongue ring and I flat out said no. He couldn't handle that. lol He kept asking and I was like, sorry, I only kiss strange guys who buy me two drinks. So then he was like, well what do you want to drink? And I told him, I don't drink, sorry. lol 
Ok, anyways, sidetracking here... So yeah, John is really cute and really cool and I like him a lot... but so far, no move making on his part... and of course, me, too chicken shit to make moves on any part. lol 
So yeah, we talked all weekend and finally hung out again last night. We did the coffee thing and then went back to his house to watch movies. We were gonna do a scary movie fest, but, couldn't find any worth watching at blockbuster. So, we settled for gay fest and watched Moulin Rouge. (I love that movie!) Then, like half way through, we stopped for a cigarette break and as we walk out, John's roommate is hanging out with my friend Micah... And THAT was a scary moment. lol Micah was friends with my ex Matt, who is now named unmentionable in other circles of friends. Micah's way kosher, but, kinda flaky.... oh well, still love him. So yeah, we sat around talking to him for a few and started realizing that John and I know a lot of the same people. THAT was scary... He knows Matt, and he knows David too. That one really threw me off.... Oh well. So yeah, we chilled out watching the rest  of moulin rouge, and then some live performances of Dashboard before I ended up going home at like 2. lol 
And still, no move making attempts... it kinda feels like the friend vibe actually... which kinda makes me sad, but, we'll see... I am definitely getting to the point where I'm gonna burst if we don't kiss soon... lol Oh well, it'll probably just be another wonderful disappointment... 
Well, gotta get back to work. Later kids!

I went out Saturday night with Harmony, Annie, and Penny for Penny's Bachelorette get together... we had a lot of fun... we went to Ybor to gameworks and played our little hearts out. It was so much fun to be around them again.... Afterwords, we went walking around and ended up at Kick's, a porn novelty store. Well... they also have dress up items and stuff like that and we had fun trying things on... I found a pair of boots that I was in love with and wanted to so badly, but, they didn't have my size. So the gay guy there brought down a different kind of boot that I wasn't exactly thrilled over.... but I tried on anyway, and it fit and once I had them both on, I fell in love hardcore and decided to buy them. I was gonna hold them till halloween and get all dressed up, but, I'm impatient, so I decided I'm gonna do it for my birthday. I started plotting and scheming and decided on the look... BUT, for the look... I have to do some work... which is why this is titled, new goal.... For the next month I am dieting and getting back into my work out regiment to try and get down to as small as I can go. Cus, let's face it, drag just ain't cute when you have chub. So, I started today with the atkin's diet again, and will start running everyday with Jessie and doing specific exercises to work me out. The look I'm going for will be somewhere around this:
<br><center><img src=""http://www.britneyspears.org/pic0603/vma2003/01.jpg""></center>
<br>Generally speaking, that's the platform for my outfit. But, probably more in black since my boots are black... I'm going with the blonde, as long as I can find a decent looking wig to work with. I thought about tracks, but, don't wanna be stuck with all that hair forever.... lol So yeah... I have to get down a bit. I may even use a corset with the outfit, don't know yet.
It was sad though... all night in ybor, I felt almost butch till we went to kicks and it just all went to hell... lol 
Ok, so, there's my update for now... I'm gonna post progress as I go along... have fun everyone! Peace!
Jay."

"event","Yeah, so, I'm updating finally... I never do it anymore... Haven't been having a good couple of weeks.... monday the 19th was the anniversary of my brother's death... not a very yay happy time... and of course every fucking free moment I have has to be monopolized by Jessie which is quickly getting on my last nerve. I went up to clearwater with her Friday night and spent the night. And beforehand I told her to take her own car because when I was ready to go, I was gonna go. But she complained and whined and was like, I swear when you're ready to go I will go, period. So we stayed the night and the next day I was ready to go home.... Let's wait so Jen can bring us home some food. And then, let's watch movies and blah blah blah. And then we pick jen up from work and Jen buys food for breakfast the next morning and I was like, I'm going home. But, she bought it anyways. And then when we got back to the apartment, I told them I was ready to go, and said was like, ok, I guess... and then Jessie tried to lay the guilt trip on me... she bought us breakfast and she hates being here alone and blah blah blah... till I was finally like, ya know what? I am never bringing you up here again, because last night you swore when I was ready to go, we would go, no hassle, and I've been ready to go since I woke up this morning, but I was patient and let you stay but now, I am ready to go home, and I AM going home. So then Catina calls(Hi boo!) And is like, let's do something cus my plans fell through. So Jessie asked if I wanted to do anything and I said yes, I want to go home. So she was like, we'll figure something out and let Catina go(hi boo!). And kept trying to convince me to go out, so finally I lost my patience and just got nasty and was like, I am going home, period, quit asking me to do all this other shit. I AM GOING HOME. So we leave, and on the car ride she's still asking if I wanna do something... she was like, is there anything you wanted to do tonight? ""Yeah, go home."" You know what I meant. ""yeah, and the answer is still, go home."" So then she asks if I will pick up Catina on the way to her house(hi boo!) because she's too fucking lazy to drive two damn blocks to pick her up. And because she knew if Catina was there (hi boo!) That I wouldn't be able to be a bitch and just be like, I'm going home. But luckily, Catina didn't wanna sit at Jessie's house for the twelve hour get ready ritual she was to go through to be ""cute"" for twenty minutes before her globs of make up melt off and make her look nasty because it clumps up everywhere on her face since she has some gland problem aparently and sweats like a fuckin kkk dude in the middle of africa.... Ugh. So, finally I got to drop her off and she was like, do you wanna come in for a minute and chill with me? And I just gave her the dirtiest look in the world, closed her door and left. lol 
Ugh... I haven't bothered to answer my phone to her since then. 
Sometimes, people just get on your fucking nerves.... 
Anyways, so yeah, I'm sitting at work now, bored out of my mind, with nothing to do because all of my work is done and we're dead as hell... ugh... I'm feeling VERY PMS'y and just wanting to kill someone today. 
And I fucked up big time.... I bailed out on Kelly last weekend when we were supposed to hang. No real reason for it, I just didn't feel like the people thing last week with shiny happy reminders of my brother and all... but I know I hurt her... I do that everytime... I'm no good for that girl. She's spent the last ten years of our lives just trying to be my friend and I just... I don't treat her the way I should because she is an exceptionally wonderful person and one of the most genuine people I know.... but I think she's better off without having me around... I'm no good for anyone. lol 
Oh well, I'm gonna get back to my boring life now... I'll updtae again sometime in the future.

"event","So yeah... Travis called me today and told me the bad news. He's not coming. The party he was supposed to perform at got cancelled, so, no plane ticket. Now we have to wait till next weekend so he can go buy one for himself. So I'm angry... I was all excited that he was coming, and I've been telling everyone about it and now, nothing. =( 
Oh well. I'm just gonna go out tonight and get drunk then. I'm getting another tattoo and another piercing tonight. That'll make 5 tattoos and 12 piercings. I miss my nipple piercings. =(
they were my lucky 13. ::sigh:: Oh well. 
I went out with my friend Ryan last night and we went to an all night diner... that was some scary shit.... We had food there.. I had a spinach and feta cheese omelet... which was so nasty tasting! Remind me to ew on Feta cheese in the future... 
Anyways, we ate, we went driving and had fun making fun of everything, and then I went home. I got sick from the damn cheese. It's frickin 3:30 in the morning and I'm in the bathroom huggin johnny for dear life... then I come out and my mom is standing there like, what's wrong? Did you get too drunk? Do too many drugs? Now you're gonna be too hung over for work in the morning. And I was like, no retard, I had some bad cheese and got sick from it. I don't drug anymore, and I only drink occasionally on the weekends. My mom is such a spaz... anytime something isn't right, it's because of drugs and alcohol. Period. It's fuckin fabulous... 
I'm so excited about piercings and tattoos tonight! I can't wait! hehehe
Ok, running away now, but leaving you with the perfect image of me. =)

I have nothing exciting to write about... work is work... nothing great going on there. Home is home... nothing too exciting there. I cleaned my car today though. That was kinda fun.... I just feel bored anymore... I dunno.

"event","so, yeah, sitting at work bored as hell, as usual.... I'm starting to itch like, hardcore.... lol 
I got sunburned this weekend really nicely and now it's at the itching stage, but it hurts to scratch it... grrrrrrr.... lol 
So, I rented Party Monster last night... scary movie.... It's got the kid from the home alone movies whose name I can't spell, and Seth Green, and Dylan McDermot, and Wilmar Valderamos from the seventies show, and the kid who played the fat gay kid on My So called Life... It was so weird... It's about the party/gay/drug scene of the 80's.... MC, the home alone kid, is this gay guy who like comes on to the scene and is so intent on like being someone, he starts working for a club throwing all these parties and stuff... and he's like major antin the drug stuff, until he meets this guy, wilmar, and falls in love, and he's a drug addict, but not like heroin chic or anything... but finally, MC gets fed up and they fight, then he does all of wilmar's coke and is like, I just wanna see what you're ruining our relationship for. So yeah... it just kept getting weirder and weirder after that... like, the bad acting, plus weird themes, and wow... it was just... different. lol 
I'm getting Nervous... Travis is coming down next week.... I'm excited slash nervous... I can't wait to see him. I'm a dork, I know... I haven't felt this way since KEvin and well... Kevin is a drunk. I'm done with him calling me drunk and getting attitudes and everything... I don't need that. 
But, so yeah, tonight travis is renting gothika and we're gonna watch it on the phone together. I love that movie... Oh well, I'm running off back to work now. Kiss noises to all.

I got sunburned over the weekend, really well done on my back. Lori, at work, comes up to me and puts her hands on my shoulders this morning, which is dealable... and she's like, ""you got a sunburn, didn't you?"" And I'm like, yeah, see the redness, it's everywhere, on my back, my shoulders, all over. And she's like, ""I know that's gotta hurt hon, lemme know if you need anything."" And then starts rubbing my shoulders and patting my back really hard, and I'm like, yeah, I need you to not hit me where I'm sunburned! Thanks. =) 
lol 
She's done it several times today and I just wanna be like, listen here you stupid bit! I have a SUNBURN.... searing flesh on my back and shoulders, getting hotter by the minute, so please, refrain from frickin touching them before I have to rip out your rib cage and wear it as a hat! 
::sigh:: 
Anyways, I talked to Travis for a few hours last night on the phone... Travis is my Ohio boy. He's awesome as all shyt, and I can't wait for him to get down here. We're gonna have a lot of fun. hehe
I've been like dieting and stuff all since last week, it's weird.... like, I have't had sodas, or much fatty foods... lots of chicken and salads. It's strange... and then friday night I went running, and tonight I'm doing it again... I don't know what's wrong with me... Like, I'm even working on quitting smoking... I have one last pack of cigs left, and they're non menthol, I mean, come on people! lol 
I'm scaring myself. Like, I'm not even concsiously being all like ""ooo, diet, watch what you eat"" blah blah blah... I just am in the mood for the better stuff... I tried to drink a soda today and about passed out from the shock. The frickin sugar and syrup is soooo nasty.... Ugh. 
Oh well... I'm going running again today, any takers? 
Hmmm... guess not... =/ Oh well.... I'm gonna get back to work. Later guys!

"event","So here I sit again, updating this journal.... seriously, I need a life... lol 
::Sigh:: I don't do ANYTHING anymore, it's really sad. And for someone who used to never be home and always had a million people to call... I'm seriously lacking. 
I think I'm just in uber anti-people mode. Maybe getting a little too jaded.... It's strange to think about how I used to be soooooo friendly and always happy.... I was literally, friends with every single person I saw. lol I went out of my way to make friends with people a lot of the time. But anymore.... all I have left is Jessie. And that's just plain sad..... 
I got to hang out with Michele and Brian from work this friday... it was a lot of fun, but such a bad idea.... my crush on Brian is starting to return and that is soooo not a good thing. Mostly because the more I like him, the more a bitch I become. 
I don't know why I've turned out this way... I'm snobby, stuck up, and bitchy. But in a funny way.... kinda. I dunno.... I miss being cute nice lil me. Too many assholes stomping on me though.... I sat down and thought about it today.... my relationship record goes as follows:
Jack; first guy love, complete tore my heart out when he proposed and I wasn't ready.... 
RJ; big high school boyfriend. Cheated on me and turned into a true asshole gay guy. 
David; big time love affair for me, turned really sour when he wasn't ready to come out. 
Joey; the guy I moved in with.... was so wonderful... till he slept with someone else and became some emotionless prick and slut who spends all his time planning his next get off session and completely ignoring my existance. 
Jason; guy I crushed on... had a boyfriend. Wouldn't leave him. But liked having me on the side.

-.-

other Jason; guy I crushed on who turned out to be way too much of a sex freak to even realize I had a brain and personality to go with the penis he was in love with. 
Kevin; actually a really great guy... perfect match in every way. A bit on the jealous side, and very much with the being too far away.... living in new york area and all...
Nick; big love, too young to deal with it... he wasn't ready for it, and we broke up for him to date 12000 other people and yet still tell me everyday that he loves me. 
Ramon; frickin beautiful kid, great in bed, no personality... turned out to be like all the other fags. Use and lose. 
Ryan; crush from after high school... we had such big plans to be together and blah blah blah, inseperable 24/7 and blah blah blah.
He now lives with his girlfriend of over a year and a half. 

Like, just lookin at all this makes me think... what the hell is out there that's worth going through all this shit to get it? 
NOTHING. 
Maybe that's why I'm so jaded.... The last couple of guys I dated.... I didn't connect with at all. On some level, because I just didn't want to. They were great enough all right.... but I just didn't want the drama. The most recent problem... was Jeff. 
Jeff was a guy I met and fell head over heels for. He was smart and opinionated and sweet, and such a beautiful person... we were like mad crazy for each other. Then he moved.... my brother died... and we got busy. We saw each other at a club about a month ago and started talking hardcore again. Then my neice came down and brought up WAY too much stuff about my brother that I was prepared to start remembering. So, I reverted to shell form and cut off a lot of people. He suffered... and I hated that, and I tried to talk to him to get him to understand what was going through my head....
My favorite line he gave me was... ""Everything for you has to be so much drama, and your life is so easy. I would love to see you go through what I go through everyday, you wouldn't make it one day."" 
As if to say that, whatever my probelms are, they mean shit because his must be much more important because they're his problems. And then as we're talking, he's making me feel like a complete jerk, going on about how I fucked up his head, he hasn't been able to date anyone successfully since he met me and he can't figure out why and blah blah blah, I fucked up his head big time, blah blah blah.... URG! Our converstaion ended with him getting mad because I didn't know what he was talking about when he asked if I ""remembered that serious conversation we had online that night""
WHAT NIGHT?
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE TALKED ON THE INTERNET AND OUT OF THE BLUE YOU WANT ME TO REMEMBER ONE SPECIFIC NIGHT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD? I HAVE ABOUT 100 TO GO THROUGH IN MY HEAD BEFORE I COULD REALIZE WHICH ONE YOU'RE TALKIN ABOUT! 
And so... he stormed off, I went and beat up my car, cried for an hour before going over to my friend steph's house to vent and feel like more shit.
::Sigh:: 
This entry is turning out to be a lot longer than I expected it to be....
I guess my point is just.... my stellar history with guys seems to preceed itself.... I just... don't wanna do this shit anymore. I'm tired of it ALL. 
URG.
Ok, venting done, if you're still reading this by now, I'm sorry for you. lol

I just haven't been sleeping very well lately.... It's like the closer I get to my brother's birthday and april it just gets kinda harder.... I dunno.
I'm so over boys. They're all assholes. My ex Jeff wanted me to come and see him and get coffee or something and I decided to go because he was a really great guy, we just didn't click. So we hang out and he spends the whole time telling me how I fucked up his head, I have made it impossible for him to have a relationship since he met me... I am all he thinks about and he can't figure out why and all this other shit that was just really hurtful the way he said it.... And then he just bails out on me. He asked if I remembered some converstaion we had had a while ago and what we talked about and I told him I honestly didn't because I wasn't sure which one he was talking about. He got pissed and just left. I was so angry... Like, what do you say to that? That's why I stopped dating... He's like the tenth boyfriend to tell me that I fucked all their shit up. I'm just done. I'm not meant to be a boyfriend, ever. I will just masturbate like a mofo and spend my life around women. lol 
Ugh... I'm probably gonna go home and like overhaul my room and clean the shit out of it and hang all my posters back up and stuff.... I dunno. I'm kinda in the mood for it... though I'll probably just go home and play Buffy on my xbox.... ::sigh:: oh well, gotta bounce from work now. Later all.

Let's see... critical life updates.... 
And that's the end. 
No boys on the horizon because I decided boys are evil and I'm staying away. I'm just gonna masturbate a lot. 
I think it's mostly been my recent experiences.... it's like, everytime you like a guy and make some kind of effort.... they go all evil on you. It's insane....
Joey is a fucking prick! I hate his fucking guts and the next time I see him anywhere I'm going to bash his brain in with a toothpick just to get the satisfaction of destroying every part... 
Um.... other than that, no biggies goin on. 
Going to see britney spears at the end of march in miami. fun fun fun. Gonna spend the whole weekend there just playing and having a good time. 
This weekend.... completely devoted to my Kelly.... she's having a hard time lately and I need to be there for her... I'm always so wrapped up in my own shit that I sometimes forget she exists.... it's like I kinda feel like she's ok, she's got her own life that I don't really fit in to, and so I don't worry.... Then I hear otherwise and I feel like a dick for not being around.... I dunno.... 
Ok, going back to the Buffy marathon I committed myself to. I'm determined to see all of fifth season by the end of the night.... I can do it. =)

"event","Just don't wanna deal... taking a break from dealing. Happily vacationing in the land of not coping....

That's about where I'm at right now. This weekend just sucked for the most part. 
I'm fairly certain that my friendship with just about everyone is done with now. Jessie managed to complete tear apart the last bit of friendship we had. She was very mean to me Friday night, and I know she was just being her but... at the time, it's not what I wanted to deal with. And as a result... I'm having a hard time focusing on her in a positive light. And then to add to the fun, it feels like Todd and Jackie don't really want me around much. So, I just kinda decided it's time to cut ties. I haven't dropped anyone in a while. 
But it's like... I'm scared to just do that because then where do I go? My life outside of work, is in my friends. Without them, what do I do? And yeah, I have friends at work, but no one I see outside of work. I dunno....
I'm thinking about just making myself retardly busy with work. Take on another job and just be a money machine for a while. I just.... I feel like I don't even know myself anymore. I've spent too much time relying on my friends to help me know who I am, that I haven't taken the time to know for myself. I don't wanna be that person anymore. 
::sigh::
Ok, I'm done with that part, now just details of my week/weekend. 
I got a new phone last week through sprint. I have a beautiful camera phone now. Very sweet. I like it a lot.... Downside, I't gonna leave me broke till after christmas. My first bill has activation fees and service charges, and I still have my other phone till january. Plus my insurance company is wanting more money, saying that the credit from removing my acura has ran out, I have to pay 179 dollars by the 24th to keep my insurance till january. Add that with my mom's rent, and my gas and stuff, and I'll have about 300 for christmas. For everyone. So yeah.... I'll be very happy when christmas is over. =( 
But so, Friday, went and saw Gothika.... OMG, sweet ass movie! It was totally killer! I have major respect for halle as an actress now. 
After seeing that, we went to sacred and then denny's. It wasn't too bad... Saturday, My friend Nikki and I went to go see Matrix Revolutions. Then we chilled at Todd and Jackie's house. I think Jackie was mad that I was hanging out with Nikki.... and Todd was treating me like I was a retard all night.... Sunday I just went home and did laundry and watched tv. I didn't wanna deal with anyone, so, I didn't. 
And today my allergies are going insane. I hate winter. 
I feel completely disconnected from everything today. I just don't feel like me.... Whatever me feels like... 
Oh well, I'm done being a retard. Later."

"event","So, there's nothing like having your ex boyfriend ramble on about how much he loves you while he's drunk at one in the morning. I had Joey doin that last night. He has pretty much shut down since we broke up, so, getting him to use a ""feeling"" word, is like impossible. And last night he was going on about how much he loves me and how much he actually misses me sometimes and blah blah blah. It was pissing me off because it takes alcohol to get him to be honest with me. I don't sit well for that.
Where the hell does that expression come from anyways? 
Ok, so, in other news, I took my other nipple piercing out last night. I just got bored with it. And it was starting to get a lil infected and that was pissing me off more. I'm tired of those damn piercings never healing right. IT's just not worth it to me. So, they're gone. I'm back down to 11 piercings. I think I'm just gonna go get my labret done this weekend and tell Lanny to fuck off. The handbook doesn't say anything about piercings and I plan to exploit that to the furthest. =) 
I am getting tired of my job. It just pisses me off everyday more and more. I was having fun this last week because of ""competing"" with Nichole for orders. But, beyond that, I hate everything here. I just want out, but, I'm terrified to start all over again at another company. grrrrrr
Ok, going back to work now. Kisses all."

"event","I'm at work... tired already. It's been a long day so far. Orders started right away because Nichole had to cover the front. I didn't get my credit cards done till late. I took 12 orders in a row from gary. I took so many elite calls it's disgusting... and I had an asshole sales rep from ace that was just overly rude... I wanted to jump through the phone and smack him with my dick or something. grrrr.... 
So, ""dood"" called me the other night. We're gonna get to see each other again this weekend sometime. Should be interesting.... I haven't seen him in a while. I think we might start dating again.... scary. His penis scares me. It's massive. Like, Ramon.... ain't got shit on this guy and we all know how pleasant Ramon was. =)
Ok, I'm done now. Gonna go hang myself or something."

Remember the snacks? And no, not just the vds.... here's a little song for your childhood enjoyment....

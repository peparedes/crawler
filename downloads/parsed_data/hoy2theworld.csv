"event","There was a time and place,
Where I never thought,
I'd leave my own hometown,
But those days finally,
Are dead and gone,
It was never my intention to stay here,
Oh no,

There was a concious effort played by me,
To disown anything I see,
There was a girl I knew,
Way back when,
Who says she doesnt know me anymore,
These are the lies the things you never mention,
These are my past mistakes I'll stay away from,

These are my thoughts written down on paper,
It's my only savior,
From not saying what I want to say,
These are the thoughts that are on my mind,
Moments that haven't yet been defined,
And I dont know if you could ever understand,
These are the things I cant say when were alone."

Late December back in '63.
What a very special time for me,
'Cause I remember what a night.

Oh, what a night.
You know, I didn't even know her name,
But I was never gonna be the same.
What a lady. What a night.

Oh, I. I got a funny feeling when she walked
In the room and I,
As I recall it ended much too soon.

Oh, what a night,
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me.
She was everything I dreamed she'd be.
Sweet surrender, what a night!

"event","wow...today was...MESSED UP, TRAUMATIZING, SHOCKING! *KINDA FLATTERING*...let me tell u about it...well today, i went to my community service thing which as you all know is when i go help with my sister's color guard competitions...not a good place to be unless ur gay...which apparently a lot of guys who do color guard are...and thats where my story begins...OK, so i'm walking out of the gym...wearing my nintendo jacket and my earrings in my ears...sexy as always...i walk out and i hear this big black guy say ""hey"" to me...so i turn and say ""hey"" back...and we stop and talk...*for the story lets call this black man ""Bubba""*...so bubba says to me ""hey, i'm bubba...""..so i'm like ""i'm matt"" and then he shocks me...he says to me ""my friend over there thinks you're cute""...I'M GONNA REPEAT THIS! B/C IT NEEEEEDS REPEATING ""MY FRIEND OVER THERE THINKS YOUR CUTE!""...so i'm thinking ""HOLY SHIT! SHE COULD BE HOT! AFTER ALL MOST COLOR GUARD GIRLS ARE!""...or so i thought...then he follows it with this comment ""but HE'S too shy to come over...""........DOUBLE U TEE EFF MATE!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH! FUUCCCCCCCCCK! HE!?!?!?!?!? DAMNIT!...i just stare...blankly...shocked...traumatized...and then he has the nerve to ask ""are you gay""...FUCK NO NIGGA!!! SO I TELL HIM THAT...WELL LEAVE OUT THE NIGGA PART...SO HE SAYS ""oh and walks away""...FUCK!!! ok... so after he walks away...i think to myself...I'M TAKING OUT THE EARRINGS! FUCK MAN! HOW CAN THEY THINK I'M GAY...and then i think...but then again...at LEAST SOMEONE THOUGHT I WAS CUTE! which gives me hope b/c if i can manage to get a gay guy think i'm cute *which is prolly very hard to do since they really know style* then i can definitely SOMEHOW FIND A GIRL WHO THINKS THAT!...maybe...anyways thats my story...btw my sisters group ""star lite express"" got 1st place in their division...boca high got 5th =(...oh well...they were nice to me...unlike certain people in certain clubs"

"event","Dear, Benevolent Yuletide Writer:

I am easy. My requests regarding the respective fandoms, as you have seen, are minimal, but if even these seem unduly restrictive, then please feel free to ignore them in favor of whatever scenario you <i>want</i> to write. Like everyone else, I appreciate coherence, good characterization, decent grammar, and the use of spell-check, but I am happy to leave the details of the story itself up to you. Just make it good, please :)"

"event","I signed up for <lj comm=yuletide> and am more or less expecting to be assigned a recipient who wants something re: a particular Japanese TV show, which would be absolutely fine by me, since I was toying with writing something for/about it even before it occurred to me that <lj comm=yuletide> might possibly provide some much-needed external pressure that would push/shame me into producing something semi-concrete instead of merely telling stories in my head. It doesn't really matter what I'm assigned, however - I just like writing for challenges. This is my first time with this particular challenge, and I'm excited (as I always am with challenges) and also fairly confident that I will have some sort of last-minute existential crisis that will have everyone but me believing that I am going to bail. I never bail.*

I know this happens with all challenges - certainly with my beloved remix - but for some reason I'm really noticing and being somewhat boggled by various posts I see scattered about wherein yuletide participants are fretting about what stories they will <i>receive</i>. No doubt my motivations are less generous and more diva when I say that I care much more about what I <i>give</i> in a challenge than what I will be getting, but still...is it really all about the getting and not the opportunity to <i>do</i>? Building up a lot of expectations about any gift--especially one that will probably be from a complete stranger--seems like a virtual guarantee of disappointment. 

There's a new BL/yaoi publisher looking for submissions for a BL fantasy anthology and I'm fiddling around with a story for that, as well. I don't like to read most fantasy books (never as thrilled with other people's made-up worlds as I am with my own), but I've got plenty of ideas and this is a good excuse to write one down (see above: re storytelling in head). 

And since a post from me seems to mean either a piece of fiction or a dead animal, I must report that the male parakeet, Berry, has been put out of his giant-tumor-related misery. However, we seem to have inadvertantly adopted a second dog. Mr. Jones is mostly displeased about this turn of events, but I think he'll come around. 

Has anyone read Gordon Dahlquist's <I>The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters</i>? I'm writing a little coda to it (and who knows when I'll finish it), and I'm curious if anyone besides me has any familiarity with the source. V. enjoyable book, btw. 

<small>*Okay, I <i>did</i> bail on a challenge, sort of, right after I had to put my dog to sleep. I did finish and post the story in the next few days, but I technically didn't meet the challenge, although I think dog-death makes my noncompliance somewhat forgiveable. Also, I am always late with my remix submission. I'd offer to do some sort of penance, but the likelihood is that I'd just blow another deadline in the process.</small>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""CSS vs. hard code""><b>CSS vs. hard code:</b> Despite all my complaining, I am finding the whole Joomla mess very interesting, if frustrating. I wanted to do a site redesign for my fanfic because, well, I just like to do a redesign every now and then, and I wanted to delve into content management systems a bit because they've become fairly ubiquitous. Additionally, the Mr. and I will eventually get more serious about our tiny hosting company, so it would be nice if we had turnkey CMS packages ready to go for potential clients, which means that we have to <i>make</i> them, which means <i>I</i> have to make them because the Mr. has other things to do. Like work.

If for no other reason than marketing, I am having to think more seriously about CSS. I understand and appreciate the flexibility inherent in a CSS-based site, but I am also well aware of the limitations - browser incompatibilities, in particular. I have found several wonderful tutorial sites that will show me how to do incredibly complex things with CSS, but I can't help noticing that a large percentage of these tasks could be achieved fairly easily with hard-coded HTML and...TABLES. I love tables, and the bookendy logic that nested tables require is just my kind of thing (picky and precise, yet cluttered at the same time). However, instead of doing what makes sense to me, i.e., tables and hard-coding, I have decided to start from scratch to re-make my new site template (I used code from a free template as my example for the current version) so that I can perhaps learn something practical instead of theoretical about the superiority (or so one would be led to believe) of CSS coding. 

Regardless of my intent to use CSS for the site, I am still unconvinced that CSS <i>is</i> inherently superior. I am not a real web designer or graphic designer or anything designer, and I have never been to any seminars about CSS, taken any classes about CSS, or read anything about CSS that wasn't either a tutorial or air-puffed propaganda. From my non-pro perspective, CSS is clearly a <i>design</i> ideal, and a very seductive one, at that, but it seems debatable whether it actually represents a <i>functional</i> improvement over well-considered hard coding. What I like about hard coding is that I can depend upon it: it looks like it's supposed to in every browser without work-arounds, and is thus quick and easy. Since I know my understanding of the subject is limited, I would appreciate it if anyone knows of a link to a good explanation of WHY CSS is superior to hard-coded HTML from a end-user/viewer/<i>functional</i> standpoint. 

<i>The above is also posted to <lj user=""oiran"">, so my apologies if you're seeing it twice.</i></lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Supernatural""><b>Supernatural:</b> Watching and enjoying, much to my surprise. I don't know why I'm surprised, actually, since just about everyone I know likes it. It's certainly a much better show than <i>Smallville</i> was at the beginning. Actually, it's not that <i>Smallville</i> was inherently bad when it started airing (that came later), but much of the casting seemed to have been done based on headshots alone. On <i>Supernatural</i>, both leads can act. This certainly carries some dramatic weight when contrasted to a situation where only one lead can act and the other can...stand pretty. And blush.

I never found Jensen Ackles all that attractive in his guest turn on SV, but he's extremely engaging here, as well as more physically appealing, though neither he nor Jared are likely to appear in my more feverish dreams. I'm enjoying their chemistry - they really do sound like brothers with all the bickering and fondness - but I'm not seeing the slashiness that drives the fandom. I <i>am</i> getting totally spooked when I watch (usually in the dark, so the dark video is easier to see on my computer screen), even when I am also noting annoyances like blood that dries red, a not-subliminal-enough crying baby amping up the tension on the soundtrack, or the car that switches from 2-door to 4-door to suit the occasion (thanks to K for pointing that out!). Still, I'll probably be at <lj user=""stone_princess""> and <lj user=""ethrosdemon"">'s house watching when the new season starts, fully prepared to squee and flap my hands with giddiness.</lj-cut>"

"event","I'm going to be moving my fanfiction to a new domain in the near future and will be revamping the site entirely. I have decided that I'm *not* going to put the fan art up again, except for covers made for me, and probably those made by me. All other fan art will be taken offline, so if there's something you like, you might want to get a copy. <a href=""http://www.salacious-texts.com/Glovebox/art/artgallery.htm"">It's here</a>. ""Gift Images,"" ""Crack Van Covers"" and the images posted as adjuncts to my story pages are the only stuff off-limits, as stated below. 

I've never stated a policy re: fan art before, but I will now: Feel free to use my fan art images* to make icons or to incorporate into your personal site designs. I would prefer that you not use my work as a base for your own fan art (i.e., something presented as ""Look what I made!""), but I'm not really in a position to stop you - let your conscience be your guide. If you use my work, I'd appreciate some minor form of acknowledgement - just crediting ""jed"" is enough, no link necessary. 

*This DOES NOT include covers, either made by me or for me. The impetus for making a cover is entirely different than that for making other fannish images, at least for me. They are absolutely off-limits for any and all purposes. 

Upon checking, there are a couple broken links. I have no idea why these don't work, but I'm not likely to fix them, since they're coming down anyway. 

~~~

In other news, I am actually working on finishing up some SV stories, as well as an AnK fic. Expect me to post something...eventually. Since I thought it would be last week and that clearly didn't happen, I'd now be content with finishing something by the end of the summer."

<b>Title: </b>  <I><b>All Is You and Here (Burning Bridge Remix)</b></I>
<b>Author: </b> <b>jed </b>(<lj user=""velvetglove"">)
<b>Fandom: </b> Yami no Matsuei
<b>Rating: </b> NC-17 - graphic sex
<b>Spoilers: </b> Anime and corresponding portions of the manga
<b>Summary: </b> What if there were no knock?
<b>Remix of: </b> <a href=""http://slashcity.org/lorelei/allhere.html""><I><b>All Is You and Here</b></I></a> by <lj user=""ranalore"">

<b>Notes:</b> Rana's original is a sequel to her story, <a href=""http://slashcity.org/lorelei/lonelyplace.html""><b><I>In Your Arms, This Lonely Place</I></b></a>.  My story is perhaps better described as an alternate sequel than a remix.  I would encourage anyone who plans to read my story but hasn't read <I>In Your Arms</I> and the original <I>All Is You And Here</I> to do so.  These are wonderful stories, and it was my fondness for them, as well as for Rana's particular take on the extracanonical possibilities in YnM, that led to my remix choice.  

Many thanks to <lj user=""alee_gothphyle"">, <lj user=""pun"">, and She Who Must Not Be Named for last-minute beta.  As always, my friends are gracious and accommodating, and far more patient with me than I deserve.  

Rana's title was taken from the song <I>Broken Bridge</I> by triphop piano tinklers Daughter Darling.  At the risk of sounding stalkerish, I will admit to enjoying all of Rana's listed music choices, as well as the entire Daughter Darling album, Radiohead, and Spangle Call Lilli Line during the writing of this story.  

There are (very mild) warnings at the end of this post for those who...like warnings, I guess.

<lj-cut text=""All Is You and Here (Burning Bridge Remix)""><I><b>All Is You and Here (Burning Bridge Remix)</b></I>

Too many quiet weeks since Hisoka's last late-night visit, Tatsumi wakes in a panic, half-rising from the bed before he understands that there was no knock, and there is no one waiting at the door.  He blinks, reaches for his glasses and sinks back against the pillow with a sigh.  He knows Hisoka will not come but part of him still hopes, listening past the blood thumping in his ears for Hisoka's light tap.  Shadows ripple across the bedroom wall and he searches in vain for a pattern, anything like a sign. It is possible--no, likely--that Hisoka will never come, but still he waits.  

He tells himself that, if there <I>had</I> been a knock, there would have been no time to heat the water, and thus no tea to warm Hisoka's hands.  He tells himself that it's better this way. 

On fortunate nights, the waiting exhausts him into a dreamless sleep, but tonight the tension in Tatsumi's body drives him from bed.  He pads through the dark house to the kitchen and pauses in the doorway, his hand at the light switch, before deciding he prefers the dark.  The window over the sink provides a view of a lunar garden, but Tatsumi stares without seeing as he fills the kettle.  He takes two teacups from the cupboard, hesitates a moment, then places a third beside them on the countertop.  His hand shakes as he reaches for the jar of tea.  

The three cups are identical, fine, white porcelain and they glow a milky blue where the light intersects their curves.  He isn't certain which cup represents him, which Tsuzuki or Hisoka, until one falls, untouched, to shatter on the tile floor.  As he crouches to pick up the shards, it seems painfully clear that Hisoka will not return.  This knowledge lends him a terrible calm and serves to steady his hands.

<center>~~~</center>

The morning following the breaking of the cup, Tatsumi suffers through a staff meeting while his body tells him vicious lies.  He shivers miserably, recalling caresses that he never received, languorous and silken.  He cannot bring himself to do more than glance at Hisoka, but Hisoka neither notices nor cares.  Hisoka sees only Tsuzuki. 

He has been cast aside, but remnants of the tenuous bond between Hisoka and himself linger unpredictably, asserting themselves without welcome.  While he sits alone at his desk, a feeble threnody interrupts his pulse; later, as he eats a solitary lunch, a phantom hand describes the curve of his spine. These glimpses of Hisoka's pleasure with Tsuzuki are a taunt, a second-hand exultation reminding him that he is no longer wanted.  He was not enough for Tsuzuki, and Hisoka does not need him, after all.  The connection is not something he can seem to undo, but he won't believe that Hisoka maintains it deliberately.  Hisoka would not be so cruel.

The peculiar courtship between Kurosaki and Tsuzuki is of such long standing that no one thinks anything of it, but the sudden bloom of carnality between them disrupts the department in small, awkward ways.  The atmosphere is charged and antic, rich with pheromones, faintly embarrassing for all but the parties most involved. It's impossible not to notice the flushed faces and the touches that linger, but mentioning them would be impolite and serve no purpose.  The partners take long lunch breaks behind the locked door of their office and no one is bold (or unkind) enough to knock. Tatsumi is careful not to react when Tsuzuki's paperwork is turned in completed and on time, even when it bears evidence of Hisoka's tidy hand.  He manages only a polite upward twitch of his lip when Hisoka flashes his beautiful smile.  Hisoka smiles often now, uncountable numbers of smiles. 

At one time, Tatsumi believed he could be satisfied with just Tsuzuki's friendship so long as Tsuzuki himself found some sense of equilibrium.  He likes to think that if it had been his decision, he would have gladly relinquished any hope of a renewed sexual relationship in exchange for Tsuzuki's peace of mind.  He now admits he is not so selfless.  Tsuzuki is happy beyond even the most optimistic imaginings, but Tatsumi is far from satisfied.  
Because the answer should not matter, Tatsumi forces himself stop wondering if Tsuzuki knows and simply decides that he must. Hisoka will have told him the small details of their brief, unimportant involvement.  He does not think Tsuzuki would have been able to keep any secrets, not in the wake of Hisoka's hungry first kisses.  Tatsumi needs only logic, not empathy, to believe that Hisoka would offer up his own secrets as reassurance.  
<center>~~~</center>

If anyone is to blame, it is himself.  When Hisoka first came to Tatsumi's door, he was frightened and fragile, yet as stubborn as always, irritably snapping commands as he pushed Tatsumi back on the bed.  There'd been no time for questions then.  However, never once during the months of their affair had Tatsumi asked anything of Hisoka outside of bed.  They did not discuss what they were doing or what it signified.  Hisoka never said how he felt about Tatsumi, and Tatsumi never asked.  Tatsumi told himself that he did Hisoka a kindness by not asking questions. In truth, he wanted to avoid hearing Hisoka's answers.  

<center>~~~</center>

Hisoka corners him in the file room, slightly frantic after days of Tatsumi's deliberate avoidance.  His hand is terribly white against the sleeve of Tatsumi's jacket.  Tatsumi stares at the hand, the fine bones and hard calluses, and remembers it moving over his bare skin. In his peripheral vision, he sees dark forms leap up the walls, savage as dancers around a fire.  Closing his eyes, he forces the shadows down. 

Hisoka says softly, ""I know how hurt you are,"" and Tatsumi realizes it's true, his secrets leeched by the fingers that grip his sleeve.   

Frowning, Tatsumi pushes his glasses up his nose and pulls his arm free.  Tatsumi knows what Hisoka would say if allowed: that he is sorry; that he did not meant to cause any pain.  He might even add that a clean break is best. He will not need to say that his choice was made years ago, and it has always been Tsuzuki.  

It has always been Tsuzuki for him, too, but the time when they could claim intimate knowledge of one another is long past, and Tatsumi resents Tsuzuki's worried glances.  Tatsumi will not be pitied - not by Tsuzuki, not by anyone. 
Work has always been his refuge, but if he cannot rely upon himself to remain professional and calm at the office, there will be no place left that's safe.  He feels acutely the good sense behind the warnings against office romance.  Department meetings cannot be canceled. Errors on expense reports must be addressed.  Casework requires follow-up.  Tatsumi cannot avoid seeing Kurosaki and Tsuzuki each and every workday, no more than he can block out the sounds of their laughter carried through the office wall. 
<center>~~~</center>

Such occurrences are less frequent now, but on the nights when he cannot sleep, he rises from bed without expectations. In the quiet kitchen, shadows crowd close as he prepares the kettle and boils the water, only to let it grow cold in the cups.  He always sets out two cups. Neither one is meant for him. 
<center>~~~</center>

Watari's e-mail, pocked with an excess of animated yellow smilies, reminds him that there will be a party in the break room at two o'clock, a surprise for Tsuzuki.  Kurosaki ordered in a cake as well as a large box laden with individual pastries, spots of grease soaking through the cardboard.  Tatsumi has been in and out of the break room several times today already, seething with jealous rage, yet compelled by a pathetic need to be part of the celebration.  Restless and irritable, he gets up from his desk and pushes his chair in, taking his cup in hand.  The tea in the cup is still warm, but he pours it on the roots of the dry, brown plant on the windowsill and then heads for the break room with the now-empty cup.

The break room smells of burnt coffee. Wakaba is taping up paper party streamers that are already coming loose from the walls, and a few balloons drift close to the floor, their ebullience already spent.  A few bottles of cheap champagne sit on the counter beside a stack of paper plates. Kurosaki and Watari are arranging pastries on a tray.  The cake sits in the center of the table with two candles planted atop a fluffy field of meringue, big, waxy numerals, a one and a zero.  

""Have you really been partners for ten years?"" Tatsumi asks, although he knows the answer.  He keeps track of such things.  For instance, he also knows that they've been lovers for nine weeks, four days.  

Kurosaki nods. ""Yes, but that's not so long, is it?"" He smiles to himself and licks frosting from the tip of his index finger.  ""Tsuzuki thinks no one remembers.""  He wears an expression of indulgent patience as he shakes his head, presumably thinking of Tsuzuki.  Tatsumi shakes his head too, but the forced casualness cuts surprisingly deep.  He returns to his office with his teacup still empty.

<center>~~~</center>

He leaves the party early, his head pounding.  He can't bear to watch them any more, the two of them together, moving as if connected even when they're on opposite sides of the room.  He stands to leave and voices rise in protest, but Tatsumi cites a quantity of paperwork that must be finished before he can leave for the day.  Hakushaku corners Tsuzuki and Kurosaki, and the diversion allows Tatsumi to slip from the room. 

Nauseated by the headache, he keeps the lights off and leaves his office door open in vain hope of fresh air.  He adjusts the blinds so that he has enough light to work, but not enough to make the headache worse. So long as he stays still, the pressure behind his eyes doesn't relent, but it doesn't worsen, either.  He takes a few useless aspirin swallowed down with stale water, and reaches for the folder atop the pile in his in-box.  He wasn't lying about the paperwork, though he wasn't truthful about his deadline.  He uncaps his pen and begins reading. 

<center>~~~</center>

Tatsumi must have dozed; voices in the office next door rouse him to alertness.  The pain in his head remains and he winces at the jingle of keys as Kurosaki and Tsuzuki move about their office, locking cabinets and file drawers.  Tsuzuki's shape leans next to the coat rack, near the jamb of their open door, and Kurosaki comes to stand next to him, the light from the windows throwing their shadows up on the hallway wall, easily visible from the chair at Tatsumi's desk.  

""How much did you drink?"" Kurosaki asks, amused.  Tsuzuki's shadow wavers a little. ""Will you be all right, Asato?""

Shadow-Tsuzuki reaches for Shadow-Kurosaki and pulls him into an embrace.  He kisses the top of Shadow-Kurosaki's head and murmurs something Tatsumi doesn't hear, doesn't want to hear.  He pinches the bridge of his nose and closes his eyes.  It feels as though his eyes are being prodded from behind, run through with knives.

Kurosaki laughs, a private, throaty chuckle meant just for Tsuzuki. ""Come on. Get your coat. Let's go home.""

""Are we in a hurry?"" Shadow-Tsuzuki wobbles in the doorway, pulling his coat off the rack. ""Are we late?""

Kurosaki's tone is all fond desire as he says, ""Baka. I want to be alone with you.""

It's been a long, difficult day and everything hurts. Tatsumi doesn't think.  He just reaches out and takes.  

Two pairs of shoes are loud against the tile, and their voices recede down the corridor together, but Kurosaki's shadow trails them alone.

<center>~~~</center>

The pressure in Tatsumi's head is nearly unbearable. He tries not to think about what he's done, or how he'll explain his behavior if found out.  Chief Konoe would think it unlike him, an opinion that might work to his advantage, although clearly wrong. The group has been together for decades, but none of his co-workers know him, not even Tsuzuki.  

He goes from room to room drawing the curtains against the setting sun, squinting helplessly against stabs of light.  He undresses in the dark, hanging his clothing by feel.  He puts away his suit pants, but leaves the jacket out. The biting pain behind his eyes makes him shudder and he notes that if he isn't able to light even a few candles, he won't be able to use what he has stolen. 

In the inky, humid air of the bathroom, Tatsumi turns on the taps.  He catches a glimpse of his shadow self reflected in the mirror, dark and dense crouched beside the tub.  Washing in the dark, his hands move slowly but with purpose.  It seems important to be scrupulously clean for what he has planned.  Climbing into the tub, the bathwater is hot beyond tolerance, but the scalding heat eases his headache and he imagines he's  floating in flame, purifying and soothing. When the ache in his skull has receded a little, he touches a match to the candle sitting at the foot of the tub and, to his relief, finds he can stand this faint illumination.  

Shadows move beautifully in candlelight.  

When he's been in long enough for the bath to feel comfortable, Tatsumi stands, water sluicing from his body. The air is cool against his heated skin and he shivers as he carefully towels himself dry.  Still flushed from the bath, he notes that the hollows behind his knees and the small of his back immediately bead with sweat.  He takes time, infinite time, to dry between his toes, behind each ear, any place that might need more attention. He stops, irritated, when he realizes he's stalling.  

Tatsumi picks up the candle from the foot of the tub and carries it with him to the bedroom. The tiny flame softens the austerity of the white walls.  Another twenty or so candles stand ranked on a long, low table running parallel to the length of the bed, and he crouches to light them, placing the candle in his hand back in its place.  The towel drops to the floor and he sits on the futon, slumping a little.  His suit jacket hangs innocuously from the doorknob, but just looking at it makes him feel guilty and ashamed. He hasn't done anything terribly wrong yet.  If he were to stop now, with no harm done, he could forgive himself the shameful, foolish impulse that brought him to this point.  But when he remembers the shadow on the hallway wall, Tsuzuki and Kurosaki merged against the light, he knows he won't stop. 

Easing back to recline on the futon, Tatsumi arranges the pillow beneath his neck so that it's comfortable to look at the wall.  His headache has shrunken to a distant, dull roar, scarcely noticable.  The row of candles is at his left; when he turns his head to the right, he sees the grey velvet shape of his own body stretched along the wall, his limbs and torso distinct from the flat plane of the bed, and his head tilted at a slightly awkward angle.  His neck will be stiff by the end of the evening.  

The wall is completely bare.  There are no nail holes.  There is nothing but pure, white paint on smooth plaster.  The full length of the bed can be seen in shadow, an uninterrupted stretch of sharply-defined darkness in two dimensions, without distortion or fuzziness.  The room is arranged perfectly; it couldn't be better if he'd done it with intent.

Errant shadows try to avoid his notice, overflowing the corners and spilling across the ceiling. They are drawn by even the slightest discharge of his powers, but they should not come unless called.  He will let them be for the moment; if they become too distracting, he'll disperse them with a word.  What he has planned will take concentration, but it's no challenge compared to dozens of tasks he has completed with ease.  His nervousness is due to the singularity of this situation.  He has never been this selfish before, has never used his skills so blatantly for his sole benefit.  

The words that call the shadow out come without hesitation, indecently ready on his tongue.  Perhaps he has been planning this longer than he wishes to admit.  

The air darkens as the shadow unfurls, a shifting ribbon rising from the pocket of his suit coat.  As the shape begins to coalesce, Tatsumi adjusts his glasses and checks his own shadow and the expanse of white surrounding it.  A shadow has only a man's shape; it does not have his substance.  The illusion is all that is here tonight.  He won't look at the vague, blank space where the man should be; instead, he looks to the wall, where Shadow-Tsuzuki stands at the foot of the bed.  That shape is just as solid as Tatsumi's shadow, that body just as real, which is to say not at all.  

Tsuzuki is waiting. Tatsumi inhales sharply, heart pounding. This is it, the last chance to call an end to the game before it goes too far.  Deliberately, thoughtfully, Tatsumi exhales with a soft sigh and speaks the words that seal his intent.   

In response to his voice, Tsuzuki's shadow begins to undress, the flat shapes of his clothing dropping into the dark at his feet.  First, the awkward angles of the long, flapping coat fall away, then the suit jacket is shrugged to the floor.  The shadow of Tsuzuki's necktie whips across the wall and falls in quick, graceful curves through the shadow-shape of Tatsumi's shin and raised knee.  There is a slight, pleasurable sting where the shadows merge; to a certain extent, Tatsumi can shape these sensations to his whim.  This will be his chance to test the extent of that control.

When Tsuzuki belonged to him, Tatsumi would not have allowed him to finish undressing on his own. He took such pleasure in stripping Tsuzuki's clothes from his body, uncovering and tasting the skin exposed by a rumpled, half-buttoned shirt, licking in the narrow vee of an unzipped fly.  However, it is impossible for him to take the initiative here.  Instead, he watches the wall as Tsuzuki's shadow peers down at his shirt and fumbles with the buttons, his hair falling forward, loose and too long.  A small irregularity in the wall's surface breaks Tsuzuki's fingers as they work, then the line of his nose as he bends forward.  Slightly irritated, Tatsumi murmurs an adjustment and the shape steps back. 

When Tsuzuki is naked, Tatsumi reacquaints himself with the lines of Tsuzuki's shape, remembering with longing and sadness the pliant strength of Tsuzuki's physical body.  He knew this would not be the same, but so much is missing, so much more than he had anticipated.   He is determined not to care.  He lifts his hand and beckons Tsuzuki forward.   

There's no sense of weight when Tsuzuki kneels between Tatsumi's feet, nor does the bed shift as he places his hands to either side of Tatsumi's hips.  On the wall, they are one form, amorphous and shifting: bed, man, and ghost.  Tatsumi tentatively stretches out into the vast, confusing shadow space and lets the diffuse, muscular energy of the darkness explore him in return.  The temptation to break control is strong, and he melts a little as he gets a sense of Tsuzuki beside him, just a taste, vague and dilute but delicious.  He moans a command and the still-familiar shape of Tsuzuki's lanky body covers him, warm and present, yet disconcertingly without substance.  Tatsumi grips the bedding tightly, determined not to destroy this thin illusion with an accidental attempt at touch.  

Tsuzuki's mouth seeks his, so Tatsumi squeezes his eyes tightly shut and lets Tsuzuki kiss him.  The touch is hot, urgent, and arid.  The mouth has the correct form but the dry lips are missing Tsuzuki's sweetness and Tatsumi's responses are confused and delayed.  Eyes slitted at the wall, he can't be sure he feels the pressure of fingertips at his jaw, or if he merely tilts his head in response to the illusion of an angular approach as Tsuzuki bends for another kiss.  What he sees tells him that Tsuzuki's hands move decisively, moving in long strokes down his chest followed by vigorous attention to his nipples, pinching and twisting, but all Tatsumi feels is a teasing pull.  A little desperate, Tatsumi arches his neck and whispers an order. Tsuzuki bends obediently to kiss his throat and, even without the wet warmth of a tongue, the contact goes deep and feels dangerously familiar. With a shaky moan, Tatsumi lifts his hand to shield his eyes from the empty space that curves above him, fleshless and hollow despite the slight but very distinct impression Tsuzuki's teeth against his pulse. 

Despite all that is lacking, Tatsumi gets harder and harder, writhing beneath Tsuzuki's implied form with his fingers twisted in the bedding.  Breathing heavily, his balls drawn up tight between his tensed thighs, Tatsumi whimpers and sinks a little deeper into the shadows. Tsuzuki's hand on his side is nearly solid for a moment, his touch urging Tatsumi to rock up against him, to press into his absent weight.  The air folds over them, a hundred shades of gray drawing close and giving weight to the breath in his lungs.  Eyes closed, Tatsumi feels his skin melting wide open as Tsuzuki becomes more solid, more real.  Hard nipples graze his chest and he's stung by the rasp of a day's growth of beard against his cheek.  He has missed this so much. Tsuzuki's cock is hard alongside his own; it won't take long now.  Tatsumi reaches to cup the back of Tsuzuki's head in his hand, to pull him in for a deeper kiss, but the ephemeral body under his fingertips shifts like sand.   

The illusion breaks like china.  Pulling himself up out of the dark, Tatsumi props himself on his elbows and coughs until his breathing steadies.  He prefers looking at the floor to the shifting form crouched between his thighs.  When his breathing slows, Tsuzuki's shape is there on the wall, waiting for instruction.   

He forgot; he can't forget.  He mustn't touch. 

The dry heat of the shadow's mouth envelops his cock. He'd always liked sucking Tsuzuki, liked the hands twisted in his hair and the tremors that wracked Tsuzuki's body.  But this is nice, too. 

It's been decades, but Tatsumi hasn't forgotten anything.  He remembers Tsuzuki's weight shifting across his lap, thigh muscles trembling.  He can almost feel the warmth of Tsuzuki's back, damp with sweat, pressed against his chest.   They were Asato and Seiichirou then, and he was gentler than Tsuzuki wanted him to be, always keeping control.  He wasn't afraid of hurting Tsuzuki; rather, he was afraid of the damage he might do to himself.  Tsuzuki always wanted more, something harder and less loving, and Tatsumi wanted to please him.  Tsuzuki begged for punishment, so Tatsumi pushed him down roughly, a hand between his shoulder blades, and moved hard against him from behind.  While Tsuzuki rode his thrusts and sobbed for breath, Tatsumi's orgasm ripped through him as if he were made of paper.  

He was still learning then, just beginning to understand his powers.  They sprawled on tangled sheets while shadows churned across the ceiling and crashed like thunder.  Tsuzuki wanted to know what damage they could do, but Tatsumi would not let them come close enough to find out.   What he gave Tsuzuki was never enough, but he did all he could bear to do. 

The physicality of the past is neither practical nor possible here.  Instead, Tatsumi passively watches the wall as Tsuzuki's shape kneels astride his hips and reaches for his cock.

As he's taken in, there is warm, diffuse heat and feathery friction.  Tsuzuki's shape leans forward, head resting on Tatsumi's chest, as his hips push back.  It looks more intense than it feels, the wall reflecting a version of Tsuzuki lost in dirty, groveling abandon, yet Tatsumi senses only the vague impression of a penis rubbing against his belly, a chest breathing against his own, and a silky fringe of hair brushing his collarbones.  Fingers press almost tentatively against his shoulders in place of the expected white-knuckle grip. Tatsumi closes his eyes to concentrate on the fleeting sensations as he fumbles back toward that shadow space where he was almost lost, where this was almost real.  

Suddenly, Tatsumi's ears are full of his own ragged breathing, the loudest sound in the room.  Beneath this, there are the soft rasps of sexual friction, then ripples of silence spreading out, filling the house.  The shadow figure makes no sounds of its own.  The silence is unnerving.  

He recalls that Hisoka was quiet at first, unsure of himself and unwilling to admit it, holding his breath so as not to cry out.  He entered Tatsumi's bed prepared for a fight and approached his body with grim determination, as if each encounter were a hard lesson to be learned.  Tatsumi let the insults pass, and soon enough familiarity and pleasure made Hisoka confident, even bold.  His voice, already low and rough, took on a reckless edge with sex, and he liked to growl out breathless commands in a tone that made Tatsumi eager to obey. Hisoka was so sensitive to touch, so responsive, that Tatsumi never regretted the essentially superficial nature of their contact, skin against skin without penetration.  Hisoka could not describe the workings or limits of his empathic abilities, but he seemed able to feed some of his own pleasure to Tatsumi in a long push-pull of exquisitely erotic touch.  With his soft mouth, rough voice, and the pads of his fingers, Hisoka broke him utterly.  

It's funny.  When he was with Hisoka, he always thought of Tsuzuki, but now he thinks of Hisoka.  

He'd imagined orgasm was the point of this, but now it's just something he wishes to be done with.  This isn't the sex he wants, but it is sex, and the outcome is inevitable.  Tatsumi comes and his semen arcs up and falls in hot splatters on his belly and chest.  He looks down at the mess with a brief glance past it to the dark form at his hips.  On the wall, Tsuzuki's shadow is still merged with his, still rocking.  Tatsumi snaps out a terse phrase and the shadow flinches and stills.  He waves it away with an impatient motion of his wrist and it darts from the bed, its tall shape slipping into the wedge of darkness behind the open closet door.  

Tatsumi's disappointment is visceral.  He looks at the shape cowering behind the door and, for a fleeting moment, he thinks to give it the punishment that he never gave to Tsuzuki himself.  For a giddy moment, he considers the possibilities, but then he reminds himself that Tsuzuki's misused shadow is not at fault.  

He removes his glasses and polishes them on the corner of the sheet.  Somewhere close by, Kurosaki and the flesh and blood Tsuzuki are rocking together in the dark. He knows how each calls out in orgasm, how their hands tighten around wrists and grip shoulders.  He knows the taste of both skins, the weight of both bodies.  Individually, they are each as familiar to him as his own flesh, but together they are a mystery.  

Tatsumi sighs.  He feels empty and tired. There isn't even satisfaction in traveling full circle, no sense of closure.  This isn't anything he's likely to repeat.

Random things ask to be noticed. The candles are burning dangerously low, spilling wax onto the polished surface of the table.  The suit jacket must be hung properly in the closet.  He will need to wash again before sleep.  The headache has returned and reasserts itself with rabid cheer.  Perhaps eating something will help.

He heats leftover soup over a low flame and fills the kettle at the sink.  Tomorrow he will return Tsuzuki's shadow.  If its absence was noted, he will have an excuse ready.  His co-workers will not suspect him of wrongdoing, but they do rely upon his guidance when it comes to the habits of shadows.  

A bowl of soup steams on the table.  The water in the kettle is hot and the tea jar waits on the counter.  

Tatsumi takes a teacup from the cupboard, just one, perfectly whole and translucent.  He smiles a little in anticipation.  It's been a while since he last enjoyed a cup of tea.

"event","<lj-cut text=""blue plasma god""><b>blue plasma god: </b>Something that may not be apparent - though will probably make sense when considered in the context of the whole - is that I am ultimately unscientific in my beliefs.  It's not that I'm some sort of creationist (hardly!), but that I resist the idea that the study of physics will reveal the entire truth, or that perception isn't inherently limited and flawed.  As regards natural law, I am always waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Gravity might reverse or double at any time and, while it isn't <i>likely</i> to happen, you won't be able to convince me that it <i>can't</i>, so don't trouble yourself trying.  I can wear a person out with my unreasonableness.  

Mr. Glove is fond of messing with electricity which, to my way of thinking, is akin to taunting vengeful ghosts.  Of course, I can see that electricity works as advertised, and I can operate a light switch or blender or other electrically-powered facet of modern living without needing a little lie-down and a cool drink afterward, but when Mr. G tries to explain it to me, it's...horrible.  Whose idea was it to tame such a thing?  What's to keep it from licking out through the outlets and burning my ankles? I know - <i>I know</i>, okay? - that there are provisions in the system, etc., etc., but I simply don't believe the rules can't change themselves at any time if they choose to.  

Last night provided more evidence to justify my cro-mag superstitions.  

I was sitting at my desk busily photoshopping, the dog lying beside my chair, when I heard a strange hiss and...sizzle in the air above my head.  Both the dog and I looked up and, while I can't say with certainty what the dog saw, I saw a tiny burst of blue lightning, like a handful of twigs, explode above us.  A moment later, the world outside the window lit up cathode-blue and the entire house shook with a crack of thunder.  

Lightning is supposed to happen outside.  Casey, also being perfectly well aware of that purported fact, barked adamantly at the ceiling for about five minutes solid.  

Mr. Glove cannot adequately explain this indoor mini-lightning thing to me, though he vexed and scared me with talk about plasma.  I have decided that I've been marked by the Electricity God (or Gods, whatever), but I'm not sure if it's a positive or negative.  Is it a reward for my lowly, crouching, eyes-averted respect for the Powers Electric? Or is it a punishment for being a wuss and I should stick a fork in a socket to repent? I have asked Mr. Glove to keep an eye on me for a few days to see if any new powers manifest.  </lj-cut>

<b>huh?</b> I was friended by that self-appointed moral arbiter/troll person, and it never occurred to me for an instant that this person's desire to associate with me (whatever the motivation) reflected upon <i>me</i> in any way. I mean, there's ""friend"" and there's ""friend of"" and depending on how you choose to display your info, it's pretty clear whom you have chosen to associate with.  So why are so many people fretting about being tagged? If someone wishes to ineptly impart some ""wisdom"" or a scolding that I don't actually warrant, they're certainly entitled to attempt it, but I don't have to read it, take it to heart, or even care. 

<b>manga disks: </b>Okay, I feel really stupid, but I managed to mess up my organizational system (i.e., a heap of stuff fell off my desk) that told me who I'd sent disks to, and who was still waiting.  I think I've got it sorted again, so if you haven't gotten yours yet...it's in process.

<b>ETA: </b><lj user=""gothphyle""> wrote me a cruel little ficlet about a pairing that horrifies us both to the point of full-body shudders, yet fascinates with its repulsive allure.  So, I wrote her one back in comments :>  She also did a cute QaF one for <lj user=""rhiannonhero""> - they're f-locked, but read them if you can."

"event","I return to tales of injustice and perceived slights, opinions as facts, snubbing and cliques.  Ah, fandom...you never change.  

At the risk of stirring up resentments, I would like to say thank you very much to those who declared their anonymous love for me in the valentine post.  I am flattered, and am also fairly certain that I love you in return :) 

Insert long and vitrolic (and repeatedly revised and ultimately deleted) rant here re: fandom involvement, assumptions of closeness and the fallacy of community, and whether I really do want to continue sharing details of my real life with ~350 people and a seemingly large number of lurkers.  Also, whether or not I am obligated to do so (hint: I'm not).

Yesterday, Casey and I were attacked by a pit bull.  Miraculously, no one was hurt, although Casey's head was soaked in pit spit and I got a light scratch from someone's claw.  I guess the dog park isn't meant for fiercely protective little herding dogs and their very stupid sheep.  I really wanted it to be fun for both of us, as I could certainly use a little more human contact, but it's not worth risking the dog's life.  

Instead, we go on long walks either around the neighborhood or on the greenway trails.  Because he's very pretty, Casey gets a lot of attention when we walk in the neighborhood, though he's not particularly interested in meeting strangers or being petted by them. Some woman in a car stopped me the other day and wanted to know if Casey was a boy or a girl, what kind of dog he was, etc.  It turned out that she wanted me to let Casey to fuck her dog so that she could see what kind of puppies they'd make. She had four kids along in the car with her, but I was very polite and didn't ask if that logic was how she came to have so many children.

Hey, you nice people who have friended me recently because of my SV involvement? Just be aware that most of what I post now is squee about manga, stories about my dog, and pictures of my hair.

<b>tee-vee: </b>Enjoyed both <i>Veronica Mars</i> and <i>Lost</i> this week.  I did actually figure out the VM storyline long before the end, which was a first for me, and I didn't think this episode was the best...but that's really just splitting hairs, since the show is awfully damn good.  Logan's request did surprise me, though.  It's a great set-up for a season-long arc for next year, assuming they're going to use it that way.  I've been wondering how they're going to handle a new season with the promised conclusion of the Lilly murder case, and this is a very natural-feeling way to put Veronica into the thick of it yet again.

We're almost caught up on <i>Lost</i> - we still have to watch episode 12 - and it was nice to see a new episode in continuity instead of going back and forth.  I actually haven't liked Charlie (and I'm not a fan of Dominic whatsit) up until now, but the character is growing on me, and I do love his interactions with Claire. I get the impression that there are a lot of fans convinced that Locke is a dangerous psycho and I'm curious how one comes to such a conclusion.  He <i>is</i> a sort of post-crash spiritual zealot, certainly, but I'm not sure he's endangering anyone but himself.  As for sex, I'm not particularly seeing slash, but I'm loving the Jack/Kate/Sawyer triangle and if anyone has a fic rec along those lines, please comment!  

Even though I'm not watching <i>Smallville</i>, I do sympathize with some of the people on my f-list who are posting about the plague of negativity re: the show.  I can tell you from personal experience that if it really, truly bothers you, for whatever reason, not watching at all is a perfectly satisfying option.  If I ever finish any of the many-dozen SV stories that sit idle at the moment, it will be because I stopped letting the actual program (and its creepy, pandering network) annoy me.  

<b>shiny discs: </b>We got a lot of new music recently, and I've been listening to the new Bright Eyes albums pretty nonstop.  My fantasy scenario had dissipated a bit, but I'm right back to imagining me = art teacher and Conor Oberst = sensitive student in full surround-sound and Technicolor.  Also, Sharon Jones & the Dap Kings are fucking amazing, and we're kicking ourselves for not seeing them when they were in town recently.  We could have seen them for free, even!  We are going to see Elvis Costello at the Ryman in March, and I'm really tempted to drive 500 miles (the closest they're coming) to see Arcade Fire in a couple weeks.  Has anyone seen them live?  Is it worth a 500-mile drive?

The ""wolves"" are two pretty young men in fake-fur coats with attached tails.  They meet and apparently fall in love simply due to proximity, as demonstrated by some shadowy boy-kissing that's mostly hidden by bushes.  Meanwhile, a couple of witches, one dotty and one eeeevil, are attempting to kill a wealthy woman, presumably to somehow assume ownership of her estate.  The woman's family is called in by the local priest to visit with her before she dies, much to the witches' chagrin.  The witches know there are wolves about and make loud noises to the family about the danger.  They then dope up Lady Whosit and roll her wheelchair out into the garden in the dead of night, calling to the wolves to come to dinner.  Tragedy ensues, of course.

There's an effort made to show that the wolves are unfairly persecuted just because they're wolves.  Unfortunately, the metaphor falls apart quickly because, well, the wolves <i>do</i> eat Lady Whosit, and they <i>do</i> steal things, and they <i>do</i> have big, gay disco parties on the beach and keep the neighbors awake at night with their carousing.  So since the wolves are, in fact, kind of evil, then the movie is really implying that homosexuals are evil and deserve to be punished. That the old ladies are evil, as well, doesn't make the wolves' behavior any more acceptable.  

Oh, and the one quasi-sex scene is het.  It's so annoying when the only sex scenes in supposedly gay movies are actually m/f.

Wolves die at the hands of the mean, persecuting villagers, of course, and then everyone meets up in heaven at the end and they dance like dorks.  Like, really dorky.  Boy George is partly responsible for this stupid movie.  What a loser. 

The worthwhile thing is, again, the prettiness.  If (like me) you like 'em skinny and fey, with sad eyes and floppy hair, then circa-1998 <a href=""http://www5.ocn.ne.jp/~maysh/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">Lee Williams</a> is your <strike>man</strike> boy.  He looks a bit like a scrawnier Jordan Catalano/Jared Leto, at least at the time of <i>Wolves</i>. He's a bit more filled out now (not much) and apparently is the designated heartthrob on some British series called <i>Teachers</i>.  The other guy, James Layton, apparently scuttled back behind the camera after ""acting"" in <i>Wolves</i>, but he's also very pretty, although much beefier than wee Lee.  

If you've ever been tempted to see this, please just look at the screencaps available online and don't waste your time actually watching it.  </lj-cut>"

I got my Remix assignment...and I get to remix exactly the person I hoped I'd get!  I must have some sort of special favor with the remix gods, as during the last go-round I was remixed by the participant I most wanted to get my name.  The pressure will be good. It's been awhile since I've written anything--or at least anything that I have then finished.  Apparently there was a WiP amnesty thing in recent days and I (obviously) didn't participate, but I do know I have at least two Ai no Kusabi stories, at least five Yami no Matsuei stories, a Saiyuki snippet, and about forty SV WiPs all languishing.  I am not willing to admit defeat on any of them, though.

I have what is apparently a really bad movie to watch - <i>The Wolves of Kromer</i> - but I couldn't resist the idea of gay werewolves.  We were already calling Casey the ""prettiest werewolf,"" so it seemed obvious (if perhaps inaccurate) to start calling him the gayest, as well.

I am going to wander away again, and probably won't be paying a heck of a lot of attention to anything online for a few more days, but hopefully some of you are receiving your CDs/DVDs from me.  The rest will be mailed over the next couple of days."

"event","<lj comm=""in_my_purse""> was pointed out by the lovely <lj user=""lostarcadia"">, and I am 1) thrilled that such a community exists and 2) mortified to discover that it's mostly teenagers or women in their very early twenties, and now I feel like someone's mom trying to be ""cool.""  I posted a picture of the contents of my purse anyway, of course.

<lj-cut text=""blah blah purse"">There used to be (and perhaps still is) a Usenet group called alt.fashion where I used to spend far too much time.  There was not really all that much <i>fashion</i> talk going on, but the makeup babble was nonstop. No one ever referred to the topic threads as memes, per se, but I guess that's what they were.  Every day, someone (one of the regulars, typically) would post the question: <i>What are you wearing today? </i>and it would result in threads that were hundreds of responses long, people both giving their own outfit descriptions and commenting on what others were purportedly wearing, giving out the giddy compliments, etc.  <i>What's in your purse?</i> was another popular regular thread, and my particular favorite. 

The thing about an active, chatty community where everyone talks about makeup all the time is that suddenly you find yourself needing a lot more makeup.  At one point, I did a response post to the <i>What's in your purse?</i> thread and was chagrined to discover that, between my purse and work tote bag, I had 73 different items of makeup with me (including 20+ almost-identical shades of red lipstick) and was thus prepared for any drag emergency that might arise.  Yet, on that day I was actually wearing only sunscreen and a little bit of lipgloss.  Even people on alt.fashion found that extreme - their response verged on an intervention. Very embarrassing. After that, I put myself on a strict regimen of tiny purses and eventually stopped carrying a purse altogether.  In retrospect, it's not really all that surprising that I was able to survive a day away from my home without having 73 different makeup items immediately at hand, but it was something akin to a revelation at the time. 

After about a year spent mostly purseless, I eased myself back into the world of small leather goods and, happily, seem to be able to maintain a purse-normative state without difficulty.  </lj-cut>

Such a peculiar desire, to want to look inside other people's purses (it's a joke almost making itself - there's a sticky, Freudian glaze practically dripping from this sentence), but it's comforting to see how many others share my strange affliction.  And should anyone reading this wish to share the contents of her purse, please do go post a picture."

"event","<b>yaoi disks: </b>I got all flouncy the other day and said I didn't want to take the time to beg people for their addresses...but I'm going to <strike>beg</strike> ask nicely after all.  I wasn't smart, and I burned all the disks and labeled them and made fancy covers and congratulated myself on my many talents <i>before</i> counting the number of addresses I had actually received from people.  I'm guessing some of you changed your minds, and that's fine...but I've got all these data DVDs languishing in a heap and it makes me disproportionately sad that they are unclaimed.  The CD people were much better about sending me addresses, but some of you need to get with the program, too ;)

So, if you said you wanted a DVD and you still really <i>do</i> want one, then please e-mail me your address.  It will fill my wizened little heart with glee. 

<b>cowgirls: </b>I told Kicky I thought she should do a cowgirl routine, which means making a cowgirl costume.  Making this definitely does appeal to me, though I think <i>I</i> really want to wear the cowgirl costume myself.  I wanted to go the 60s TV cowgirl route, which means a circle skirt and crinoline with the cowboy boots and hat, but Kicky wants chaps. Since she's the one who has to wear the costume, I guess we're going with chaps.  Now I have to figure out how to make breakaway pants that won't be <i>obviously</i> designed to be torn off so that she can still be wearing the chaps when she's down to her bikini bottoms.  We're going to have a moral dilemma about the toy guns, I just know it - but how can you be a cowgirl without at least packing squirt guns?  

The good thing about chaps vs. skirt is that with chaps she can ride a stick horse in a vulgar and suggestive manner.  I'm also thinking she needs a rubber-stamp branding iron with which to claim audience members.  

I also have to pick a song. I'm was hoping to find something from Bob Wills & the Texas Playboys, but thus far I haven't hit the exact right thing.  Patsy Cline might do, but most of her songs are too slow or the lyrics are not conducive to burlesque.  kd lang is another possibility, though again I'm not sure which song.  Ditto Ranch Romance.  Any suggestions for a cowgirlish song that would work for striptease? 

<b>haruki murakami: </b>I broke down and bought <i>Kafka on the Shore</i> in hardcover, even though I prefer paperback, because I just can't wait two years or however long the publishers plan to hold back before the softcover release.  So far (about 100 pages into it), it's typical Murakami, which is exactly what one wants when choosing a Murakami book, so I'm pleased.  I'm very glad I decided to read <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> a few months back because I loved it and much preferred it to <i>Norwegian Wood</i>, the only one of his books I'd read prior to that.  I just read an interview where he talks about <i>Norwegian Wood</i> being different from everything else he's done in that it's a realistic story (as opposed to the whimsical/sinister scrim of magic realism he usually writes behind).  Maybe that's why I disliked it so.  I prefer fantasy worlds to real ones at almost every opportunity.

Kennedy is the biggest Sue I've ever seen on TV and, while I think it's a good joke, I wish she'd go away.  For the record, I so <i>don't</i> hate Spike.  I love Dawn and I have ever since she was introduced.  I think Dawn and Anya are the overall S7 favorites in our household, though Xander's little ""special"" speech in the ep we watched last night made me cry, so he's right up there, too.  We only have a couple of disks left and then we're through.  I wish the series wasn't going to be over, but I can also see that major changes would have been required to make an S8 work.  Buffy's unrelenting grimness makes sense in context, but it's hard to watch with <i>enjoyment</i>. </lj-cut>

I signed up for Remix Redux III, having really enjoyed (in retrospect, anyway!) participating in the last round.  I hope I get to write something other than SV - such as YnM or Saiyuki - although whoever gets me is going to have to remix SV since it's the only fandom for which I have ""three or more"" stories posted.  

Speaking of which, I didn't watch <i>Smallville</i>. I didn't tape it.  For those of you building SV-squee filters, I'm neither an enthusiast nor a font of negativity about the show.  I'm just not watching it any more.  Filter or drop me as necessary although, fwiw, I have no plans to alter my f-list based on fandom involvement or lack thereof.

Burning CDs/DVDs for people is ongoing, but I don't have addresses for about half of the people who said they wanted one.  I'm not going to beg anyone to give me their address so I can send them things for free, so if you really want the disk, please e-mail your address to me sooner rather than later.  Otherwise, I'll assume you have changed your mind.  Also, to clarify what these disks are: English-language scanlations from various groups that I have downloaded, most via IRC.  They are manga, not anime.  They are mostly yaoi - like, 95% (except for the special, man-appropriate disks I am sending <lj user=""seattleforge"">).

I don't know why I feel compelled to show pictures every time I get my hair done, but...I do.  I just do. My hair now matches my dog.  In order to demonstrate the pet-resembling nature of my hair, I crawled beneath my desk in order to take our picture together.  The dog does not like the flash, and has learned that when the red light on the camera goes on, the flash is not far behind, and he makes a <i>lunge</i> for it.  So, there's only one semi-decent picture of us matching, but there are pictures nonetheless: <lj-cut text=""glorious, glorious hair"">

<lj-cut text=""LJ and the elderly""><b>LJ, aging and advice: </b>If you haven't read the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/nostalgia_lj/656744.html?thread=6185576#t6185576"">""old people don't belong on LJ""</a> portion of that anon fandom-bitchery not-quite-meme-thing, it's both amusing and irksome.  The original anon poster, obviously a young girl, believes that people over 30 should stay away from LJ and specifically stop ""telling off"" teenagers and twenty-somethings and feeling superior simply due to age. 

I've not noticed people pulling age rank on my f-list, and if I do it myself, I'm certainly not aware of it.  However, once I finished reading the thread and got Mr. Glove to smack me upside the head  to stop my eyes from rolling, I started thinking about what being ""older"" means to me - if anything - especially in terms of what I share here.

Most of my f-list is younger than me. I'm going to be 39 in a couple of months. (One will note that 39 is just one year short of 40. Eep.) I don't mind people knowing how old I am after we've ""met,"" but I don't list my birth year on my info page because I believe there will be assumptions made about me based on my age, and very few of them are likely to be accurate, either for positive or negative.

Obviously, the very young person who made the anon post is full of assumptions, but they're the sort of inaccurate extrapolations that, while annoying, are forgivable in the very young who are, by definition, ignorant of life, having experienced so little of it.  Although often viewed with a similar degree of disdain, ignorance isn't stupidity.  Ignorance is a raw, educable state.  The condition is imminently correctable, but knowing this doesn't make the company of ignorant people any more pleasant (see thread).  

Age doesn't equate with wisdom, but the passage of time offers opportunities for growth and change that aren't possible during a briefer span.  Knowledge and insight lead to wisdom, and an older person has been afforded more chances at the prize simply by dint of continued breathing. A 16-year-old is extremely unlikely to have faced a similar number of circumstances requiring pivotal decisions as someone twice that age.   

Ideally, we all learn from our mistakes.  However, no one wants to learn from someone else's judgment errors, which makes huge categories of advice (or, you know, age-based lecture) moot or even offensive. Despite being a disorganized fuck-up, I actually do give very good advice, but if my opinion isn't what someone wants to hear, they disregard it based on the fact that I'm, well, a disorganized fuck-up. And if I turn out to have been right all along, then I'm a bad friend for not making a stronger argument in favor of my position.  Giving advice is a losing proposition. 

Still, when people on the f-list ask for opinions about life issues, I tend to want to give them if I think I have relevant experience. Like everyone else, I don't like to see people unhappy or hurt and if I don't think my words will cause more pain, then theoretically they might help.  Probably not, of course, but it doesn't seem wrong to try.  Also, people tend to value opinions from those they don't know well over those they're close to, perhaps with the assumption that strangers are more objective - and in most cases, they probably are - so input I give <I>here</I> probably goes a lot further than opinions I offer face-to-face. 

Reading that thread, I saw rebuttal comments from people I know (either because of their non-anonymity or their writing style) that were all blithely disregarded by the original anon. Not surprising, since that's probably how she responds to her primary example of a Right-Acting Older Woman, i.e., her mother, when they're arguing and her mother is right.  But that's how it has always been, isn't it? When you're young, you're confident in your arrogance and, flush with quasi-immortality (you know you'll live at least until you have sex/graduate college/become famous, and that's long enough), you scoff at the pedantic, clueless adults who obviously have no idea what it's like to be you.  Whereas, as an adult, you believe you have something to offer - not based on a birthdate, but upon your experiences of the world. You might even hold out the vain hope that your own humiliating/graceless/dangerous version of a common mistake might be the last example needed, and that younger generations will learn from your errors.  

It's unlikely to work out that way, though.  

~~~

Our neighbor, Mary, used to drive me crazy.  She'd had six kids and, even though they're a bunch of middle-aged fuck-ups more dire than me, she persisted in offering me unsolicited advice: <I>You'll lose your husband if you don't give him babies.  All women want babies - you'll love a baby once you have it.  Kroger is just as good as Wild Oats, and Kroger has coupons.  You ought to weed that front garden bed more often.</I> That sort of thing. She apparently went nuts within the last year, started wandering around the neighborhood in her nightgown, getting in fistfights with the other old people on our street, and now she lives in a ""home."" One of her middle-aged fuck-up progeny lives in the house now, and he never offers me advice, for which I am truly grateful. 

Perhaps it's perceived relevance that makes us resent advice from someone we believe is pulling rank. Without any identifiable commonalities, I never could see how Mary's advice applied to my life. I'm a type of person that Mary simply couldn't conceive of - childless, focused on notions, and mostly decorative.  However, because I resembled familiar humans in terms of the arrangement of my features and the number and form of my limbs, she clearly believed my life ought to properly resemble hers in its forward progress.  The mere suggestion horrifies me.   But if she'd been 70-something childless artist with too many pets and problematic brain chemistry, I'd have been much more likely to be interested her opinions, even if I chose to disregard them later.  

~~~

I'm sure there are plenty of instances of adults telling teenagers that they know better because they are older, and they might be using the terminology as shorthand for ""I have more practical experience of these circumstances than you do, and I know what I'm talking about,"" or maybe they really do believe that age = non-negotiable authority.  It might not matter re: intent though.  I can easily recall being given  advice that seemed 1) like a lecture and 2) not even remotely related to my life during my teen years and early twenties, and it was mostly ignored. 

The thing about credit cards not being free money, though? Yeah, I wish I'd listened to that. 

~~~

So there was meant to be a point to this, but it has turned out typically blunted.  

Let's try these and see if any of them fit: While aging provides the opportunity for a person to become wiser, the mere passage of time does not commute wisdom.  Anyone who claims to be wise is probably just a blowhard. If you're going to attempt to share your experiences as examples or cautionary tales, be certain they're relevant to the issue at hand. Teenagers should be taped up in boxes until they renounce annoying behavior. 

One of those is bound to work.</lj-cut>"

"event","There's a thread going on in a stranger's journal about what Anonymous Anyone hates about fandom.  There are some names named, but it's mostly bitching about general categories of people who 'ship one way or another, write men as girls, etc., and it is mostly Buffy-related, so I don't recognize many of the people who aren't going anon.  I'm wondering how this thread is any different from just bitching in your own LJ under your own name.  I certainly understand that if you're going to attempt to harpoon a BNF, you might enjoy the anon, but if you're just complaining about 'ships...who cares?  Or is that a huge issue in Buffy fandom? Like, if you pick the wrong 'ship, it will go on your permanent record, and thus your opportunities in life will be diminished? Unfortunately, the converse doesn't seem to be true, and picking the ""correct"" 'ship never delivers the riches and acclaim that really ought to be forthcoming from involvement in a pyramid scheme of media-derivative bickering.  Or maybe it's only the BNFs at the top who benefit...you should have gotten in on the game sooner.  

If there have been those kind of wars in SV, I missed them.  Not that we haven't had plenty of stupid wanks in SV, but I just don't remember this particular version.  If you 'ship Lex/Lana, you won't get as much attention or understanding as those who 'ship Clark/Lex, but it seems more likely that you'll be ignored than villified for thinking that way.  Not that being ignored feels nice, but it's usually fairly neutral in intent.

Bitching is easy.  But so is being positive.

<b>Thinks I Like About Fandom:</b>
<ul><li><b>Source material.</b>  When it's good, it's really, really good, and when it's bad, it's horrid.  But usually pretty, which is why it still has fans despite the quality issues ;) In fact, often the more horrid the source, the better the fandom.</li>
<li><b>Community.</b> <i>Hmmm...I'm a woman who likes to read ""erotica"" about two guys gettin' it on.  I wonder where I could meet other women who share my interest without ending up in a chat room talking to a dubious ""woman"" who will end up stalking me?</i> That place would be fandom. Finding other commonalities with fans makes it even better, but simply having one weird/perverted/dirty thing in common with hundreds and hundreds of people is...validating.</li>
<li><b>Encouragement and Support.</b>  Write, post, get responses.  Do art, post, get responses. Prove to yourself that you can produce material people are interested in. Try new things. Improve through doing more work. Meet other people who do similar work, then discuss and/or collaborate. And if you whine about your life every now and then, people tend to sympathize.</li>
<li><b>Inclusion.</b> Anyone can play. It's more chaotic than democratic, but it's open, at any rate. I know there are jerks who do try to keep others ""out"" or curtail other fans' involvement, but it's really not possible to quash someone entirely if they're determined to participate.  Everyone can find <i>someplace</i> within fandom, as involved or uninvolved as they wish to be.</li>
<li><b>Insidious cross-breeding.</b> My next potential fandom or burning passion may be as close as my f-list.</li></ul>

So, whatever.

"event","Remembering things is something that I'm selectively ridiculously good at, but for general purposes, it seems that I remember nothing. I have memories going back to my infancy, and I remember what people said and did, but I don't remember appointments and, if I'm enjoying myself, it never occurs to me to look at a clock.  I'm late, usually, and I don't have a good sense of how long a given activity will take.  But if I'm not interested or entertained, time drags and my impatience increases until I'm actually angry. I am usually restless before a mediocre movie is over (to the point of just leaving if I'm by myself and Mr. Glove isn't there to protest that I'm wasting a ticket), but I can spend literally hours doing some picky little thing that engages me, drifting in a zone of pure action and wordless thought so pleasureable that it is always a grave disappointment to reemerge into a world regulated by clock hands and expectations.  

I just found my old Palm Pilot in a box.  It was dead, of course, and had purged itself of every single bit of information I'd put into it, including several programs I had purchased and a huge database I'd created to, um, <small>detail commercially available cut rose varieties by name, color, form, grower and a plethora of other infinitesimal factors.  (I was going to be a florist once upon a time.)</small>  While the loss of data is disappointing, I'm no longer needing to compare and contrast, say, degree and type of petal curl between similarly colored varieties from different growers, so I suppose it's no great tragedy.

Obviously, the PP will help with remembering things, scheduled appointments, etc., so I'm very pleased to have found it.  However, while inputting the new data I could not help but note that the PP weighs kind of a lot compared to the little phone and super-adorable little camera that I carry around with me already.  Also, it's has a dim, monochromish screen - black on...that ugly greyish beigeish greenish screen color.  I'd like to have something new and shiny with a color screen and, although I love the little phone I've had for a few months, it's not like I'm married to it.  Mr. Glove and I have been discussing switching cell carriers from Sprint to T-Mobile.  We've been with Sprint for five years, but they don't seem to value long-term customers and their coverage sucked the last time I drove I-40 cross country. If we do switch, we'd consider getting Blackberry phone/organizer things or Sidekicks instead of plain vanilla phones.  I'm leaning toward the new Blackberry phone vs. a regular Blackberry or a Sidekick. 

So: anyone have good or bad experiences with T-Mobile? How about with a Blackberry or Sidekick?  How comfortable are the PDAs used in phone mode as opposed to a regular cell phone?  We're in no big hurry to do this (plus, those phones aren't cheap), but I'd like to gather some empirical data from real-life field testers if at all possible."

"event","<lj-cut text=""I have a hard time throwing things away...""><b>clutter: </b>I have a box, not small, which contains a substantial quantity of ballpoint pens and half-used pencils.  The ballpoints are cheap blue Bic Stic pens which I believe Mr. Glove absentmindedly brought home from a job he had...oh, about nine years ago.  The half-used pencils are, well, <i>half-used pencils</i>. The dried-up erasers on the ends of those pencils are now completely useless.  Why am I not able to just cavalierly dump them in the trash and move on?  I keep thinking that they might still be useful to <i>someone</i>.  That someone, however, isn't me.  I am consciously restraining myself from testing the pens to see if any of them write because 1) I don't use ballpoint if I can avoid it, and 2) I don't use blue ink if I can avoid it, so even if there are still-juicy individuals in this box of nine-year-old cheap pens, I would not use them anyway.  These things are obviously garbage, right?  I'm asking you.  I'm trying to convince myself that they are, that it's okay to just throw them away.  

Old software from the early days of Windows. Floppy disks that may or may not have data on them (though it would be very old data if present). Boxes of form paper for a job I haven't done in years. A non-functioning laser printer for which replacement parts are no longer available.  Ten-year-old bags of cough drops. Little plastic figures that used to sit on top of my monitor three jobs ago.  This is all garbage, too, isn't it?

What about things I just don't want any more? Some of them I know I should/could sell.  Others I ought to give to Goodwill, or to people who might want them, perhaps on the f-list.  It would be easier to throw them out, but I can't do that because it's so wasteful and...squandery.  Squanderiffic.  Whatever.  I really don't want to spend the time to make decisions about these things, so I don't make the decisions and thus the stuff piles up.  For instance, at the top of a nearby heap: Hello Kitty pencil boxes.  Two of them. They've got buttons that make little drawers pop out and such and they're cute--if you're into toothachingly darling plastic trick boxes.  I wanted them twelve years ago, but I've never put so much as a pencil in either one, and they're just...sitting there.  

Anybody want them?

My current methods are basically thus: Evaluate each and every item on its own merits, real or imagined. Rank these unwanted possessions on a vaguely-defined hierarchy of possible utility.  Make decisions - if at all - only after much soul-searching.  This gets a bit tiresome.

"event","<lj-cut text=""six apart and article on salon.com"">So, there's this article on the Six Apart purchase of LJ on salon.com (<a href=""http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2005/01/08/livejournal/index.html"">here</a>) which is entitled <i>Turmoil in Blogland</i>.  The author, a Danah Boyd, characterizes LiveJournal as a haven for misfits and freaks.  In fact, there's the implication that there are no users <i>but</i> misfits and freaks, unstable and off balance, requiring the community support only to be found on LJ to thrive and survive.  Um...okay? I guess you could look at it that way.

A quote from the article:
<i>For those of us who care about keeping space open for anyone who veers from the straight and narrow, this business deal is cause for concern.</i>

Except then there are quotes from Mena Trott - and a direct link to the text of a speech (which was apparently actually delivered in an abbreviated form) - which do not support these fears.  In fact, they put them to rest, if one believes that Ms. Trott intends to behave in congruence with her words.  The article (and its title) seem designed to do little more than fan the flames of panic and disgruntlement amongst a group already prone to panic and disgruntlement, i.e., us.

I get the impression that Danah Boyd is an LJer who approaches every issue with the assumption that she's already been marginalized.  It's a bad position to be in when you're supposed to be reporting facts - or at least reporting opinions congruent with the facts presented.  I'm a long-time salon.com reader, but they're more willing to present opinion as news than I'm comfortable with.  

I'm not worried about my freedom of speech being curtailed. The terms of service, so far as I can see, are not substantially or meaningfully different from the current ToS.  If they are indeed significantly <i>legally</i> different, could someone point me to a link that explains <i>how</i> they are different?  The new set seem basically like the old set, i.e., an ass-covering few lines to allow the company to boot off child pornographers and serial trolls by citing ToS issues.  

I've not seen any evidence that the Trotts/Six Apart have any interest in regulating content.  They want to make money - that's obvious from what they did/attempted with MT, but there are just a few ways they can make money from LJ, and that's by increasing their customer base and/or rates. That's the thing that is somewhat worrisome: Pricing. Mr. Glove ran an online magazine using Moveable Type for a couple of years but had to drop MT when Six Apart announced a ridiculously expensive pricing scheme that would have forced him to turn his hobby into a money-maker just to support the blog.  (Of note, most people use MT very differently than people use LJ, which is something that Danah Boyd's article does point out.  A person who just wants to use MT as an online diary can still do so for free.)

Although MT is still used widely, MT's own TypePad, a sort of blog-lite like LJ, basically tanked.  Apparently, it was easier to buy the competition than to promote or further develop TypePad.  Stabilization of LJ, improvement of infrastructure, and probably a wider array of customizable features are likely results of the merger, but it's also likely that there will be significant changes to the pricing structure in the year or two post-merger.  Hopefully, Six Apart has learned something about community tolerance and pricing after the meltdown following the announcement of MT licensing costs.  

I'm not worried about being booted off LJ because I post dirty porn.  I'm more concerned that free users will eventually be phased out.  Please note: I haven't seen anything to indicate that this is planned, but based on the MT pricing experience, it certainly isn't <i>un</i>likely. I'd willingly pay more for LJ than it currently costs but I'd hate to see ""friends"" be forced out due to rising rates or the elimination of free accounts. </lj-cut>"

A wet sheltie turns into a sort of...feltie.  We had a long brushing session anyway, and he drooled and leaned against me in a manner I choose to interpret as adoring.  

I'm continuing to organize my work area, which is a somewhat daunting task.  I was looking for some empty boxes and was instead diverted by a full box that contained many of the treasures that I've been missing.  Glass skulls and miniature fans and bees in boxes and broken mirrors.  Pictures from magazines, postcards, art projects, a self-portrait (with horns). And photos! Of me! Including one of my all-time favorites!  

I'm indulging in nostalgia here.  I'm feeling very fond of younger me.  Also - <b>WARNING: </b>the all-time favorite is basically a nude photo.  However, you can't see anything particularly ""nude"" in this one, so you be the judge of whether or not you wish to view such a thing.

My apartment, Seattle, 1991-ish. This is one of my favorite pictures taken of me, ever.  I'm about 25 here. It doesn't really look like me, per se.  It doesn't really look like anyone, or it looks like everyone (well, everyone female, white, and chainsmoking with an ashtray at her elbow). Taken by long-lost friend Keith Bingman, who I believe is working as a professional photographer somewhere now.   Keith took tons of pictures of me over the next couple of years, mostly nudes.  Somewhere I have a picture of Keith in the fishnet, but it looks better on me ;)

I had that fishnet bodysuit for a single episode of gogo dancing with the band on my girlfriend's vanity label.  The next day, a Turkish butcher approached me in the park, complimented me on my stage near-nudity, asked me on a date, and mentioned several times how much he enjoyed cutting up meat.  I declined the invitation.

My hair is slicked back with an overabundance of Sebastian Molding Mud which I had found in Xina's bathroom, and therefore I was uncharacteristically without bangs.

Huh.  I can see why people are nuts over this.  I like Sawyer a hell of a lot - I think he might be the first psychotic peckerwood series regular in TV history, so that's exciting. Or exciting-ish. 

I didn't catch names for any of the female characters.  Is Kate the brunette? In any case, she's pretty and quite impressed me with the acting.  It's sad, isn't it, when people actually doing the <i>acting</i> job they're hired to do is remarkable.  But, yeah, she's good, and I like that she's actually a Bad Girl and probably dangerous. 

And, yes, I caught the gay thing with Ian Somerhalder's character, too.  That could be interesting if they use it...

Since I still haven't watched that last SV ep I taped before the hiatus, and since I'm unsure if I'm going to continue watching anyway, I think I'll probably watch <i>Lost</i> and tape <i>Smallville</i>, or maybe just watch <i>Lost</i>. </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Alias""><b>Alias: </b>I had seen part of one episode before this, probably a couple years ago, and it wasn't quite enough to draw me in.  I had a lot (a <i>lot</i>!!) of nitpicky issues with last night's premiere, but it was still a lot of fun.  Jennifer Garner does the Brave, Wounded Hero-Girl face very well.  But I must say, I was quite taken aback by that initial shot of her running in her schoolgirl/whore uniform...what's with the scary man-abs??  And then taking into account the chiseled features...hmmm. I would imagine that everyone who read <i>Middlesex</i> and also watches this show is wondering about Ms. Garner's chromosomes.  

Even as basically a first-time viewer, it was pretty easy to follow along with what is an extremely convoluted plot.  I think it's partially due to the fact that they're <i>spies</i>, so one starts out with the basic assumption that there will be secrets and plot twists and double-crosses and such.  No one <i>ever</i> knows exactly what's going on with any certainty in <i>their</i> world, so why would the audience have omniscience?  The writers did an excellent job of providing backstory in little bits all throughout the show, which helped, too.  

While I did enjoy this, I don't know if I'd go out of my way to watch it.  It seems kind of like a soap opera that I could pick up at any time and still find reference points.  

But, really - the man-abs!  Scary! </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Smallville (with a casting spoiler)""><b>Smallville: </b>I think I've kind of had it with SV.  The other day, LaT made a great post <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/latxcvi/204952.html#cutid1"" target=""_blank"">here</a> about her frustrations with the show (the entry is f-locked), and I agree with her remarks. 

In case you can't read her post, here's my (much shorter) version ;)  The direction the show seems to be heading is uninteresting to me, and I'm actually deeply offended by the way sexuality is being used/abused as a significant program element.  If Millar and Gough want to make Lana a larger part of the mytharc, that's their prerogative, but I'm not interested in watching along. My objections are not primarily to the Lana character or to KK as an ""actress.""  I don't care about an alternative Superhistory wherein Lana Lang is more central, and I didn't tune in for that program.  I tuned in for the story of a friendship being gradually and painfully ripped apart due to differences in worldview, with both parties sure they are right.  Angst! Love! Hate!  Well, and the pretty men ;).  

I still am interested in seeing the story of Clark Kent's friendship with Lex Luthor, and then their epic break-up.  I want to see Clark Kent develop into Superman - which means that he has to learn from his mistakes, but since he never makes any mistakes, I don't see how he can grow.  I want to see Lex Luthor's descent into darkness - and I don't see how involvement in consensual sexual acts or shows of generosity toward a hostile community are leading him down that path.  

And, really, the sex thing just pisses me off so much.  I'm feeling a bit...fundamentalist, I guess.  I mean, this show is completely at odds with my <i>values</i>, and I don't see any way that the situation can be ""fixed.""  I'm glad the Alicia character is coming back for a couple eps, and I'll probably watch those because I liked the chemistry she has with Clark/Tom.  Still, I anticipate yet another insulting storyline that demonizes sexuality (especially female sexuality) from her arc. 

There have been some really fun episodes this season, but they still haven't made much sense.  Characterization changes from week to week to such an extent that I'm half-expecting an episode about how meteor juice in the water supply is making everyone psychotic to try to explain this away.  Watching the ""villain"" character be emotionally tortured every week is uncomfortable, at best. Watching the ""hero"" character behave like a thoughtless jerk is...kinda scary.  I think I might be done.  </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Veronica Mars""><b>Veronica Mars: </b>Oh, how I love this show.  I love how the Keith character is gradually (and believably) becoming less of a clowning dad and more of a smart, badass cop.  I love how the emotional moments have real, gut-wrenching impact...that stuff with Mac and her biological mother, both of them knowing and not saying anything?  Gah! So, so good!  With each episode, I'm surprised anew that there exists a non-cable show where actions have consequences, characters learn hard lessons, and there isn't always a happy ending.  And it's on UPN!!!  

The writers on <i>Smallville</i> should be taking notes. </lj-cut>"

Has there been some cross-fandom kerfuffle involving the already-arbitrary story ratings system?  I have read at least three stories in the last few days that were rated R but had no sexual content, no violent content, and no swearing.  Admittedly, when I see an R, I hope for <i>at least</i> some groping and am disappointed if it's not there, but if there's no sex, then shouldn't there be - at minimum - a few bruises or perhaps a line or two of creative cussing involved to justify the rating?  Are people just afraid their stories won't get read if they're rated PG-13?  

When I read a story that's rated R yet involves no pulchritude, fisticuffs, or off-color language, I feel like my chain is being jerked, hard.  I hate that feeling.  It chafes.

<small><b>Added to say: FYI - All the stories I'm referring to were entries in the Yuletide challenge, were therefore in somewhat obscure fandoms, and I have no idea who wrote any of them because I haven't checked back since the names were posted.

<lj-cut text=""women's work""><b>women's work: </b>I made a skirt today and it's totally cute, if I do say so myself.  I got the fabric I used (charcoal-gray wool with cream stripes of various narrow widths) about three years ago with the intent of making a giant, tent-like shirt to hide my shameful weight gain, but I never got around to doing that.  I'm not unhappy about some of my past motivation issues, because I'd much rather have a bias-cut narrow skirt with a flippy hem than a shirt with issues.

When I got my sewing machine - 7-8 years ago, I believe - I got a lot of attachments and presser feet and such with it.  A <i>lot</i>.  The machine is a Bernina and is a fairly ""serious"" piece of equipment and in my giddiness at finally graduating to a big-girl's machine, I went overboard on the extras.  I have a special gathering foot, as well as one to make rolled hems, and a few whose uses I would have to research at this point as I've never used them and can't remember what important task they were meant to help me with.  Since when do I <i>gather</i> anything?  The most expensive, largest and most complicated of these attachments is the walking foot, and I apparently had never tried using it until today, because otherwise I would have saved myself a lot of hassle and frustration these past few years.  If you need to sew things which slip or shift despite being pinned (i.e. velvet, satin), you need a walking foot.  It's totally worth the sick amount of money it costs.   

I love my sewing machine.  </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""in which I shop""><b>shopping: </b>I've mentioned more than once that I've lost about 60 lb. in the past couple years.  While I'm still 20 lb. bigger than I want to be, and 40 lb. bigger than I was when smoking, I finally decided I needed to get some clothing that would fit and wasn't totally shoddy.  We had a little windfall at the end of December, so I went shopping, specifically looking for jeans.  

I'm now about a size 8-10, which was a nice surprise.  At my smallest, I wore about a 6 due to some rather broad bones (unless you're talking about vanity sizing, i.e., when you try on $500 pants, they're always a size 2 so that you can feel both too rich and too thin). I had gotten up into the range of a size 20 at my heaviest, which was horrifying and depressing, and made shopping the opposite of fun for so many reasons.  I used to really love shopping - but I also used to have a job, and money to spend.  It's not really fun for me anymore, nor does it seem like a reasonable way to spend time, so I guess the enjoyment factor has more to do with money than how big I am.  Or maybe it's just really fucking boring traipsing up and down a mall breathing in used-up air.  

I ended up finding two pairs of jeans I liked and, due to a bunch of post-holiday discounts and a coupon that I actually didn't have but the cashier scanned in anyway, I paid only $65 for them.  One pair would have been $75 if not for the various markdowns, and I probably wouldn't have bought them at full price, even though they accentuate the length of my legs.  I'd sought out the brand (Collins) because Kicky has a pair that I really like on her - my favorites of her vast denim selection, actually.  She is pretty much a label whore, and has all these Seven jeans that look okay but not great.  For $120-150 a pair, I want wildly flattering pants, but I've seen maybe three people <i>ever</i> looking good in Sevens.  It's kept me pretty content in Old Navy, you know?  Hell, I have two pairs of jeans from K-Mart that I bought on sale for $5 each that looked good until they finally were too big for me, but I'm still holding onto them because I love them.  Yes. From K-Mart.  I'll wear them to garden in this spring and use them up down to the last beloved thread.  There are certain things I can't be bothered to be a snob about, and the origin of jeans and t-shirts is definitely on that list.  </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""smile for the camera""><b>smile: </b>Another result of the windfall is a new digital camera.  <a href=""http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=145&modelid=10595"" target=""_blank"">Canon SD200</a>.  Oh my god, I love this thing so much!!!!  It's about the size of a credit card, about 3/4"" thick, weighs nothing, and takes great pictures.

The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have any sort of cover, and I'm convinced it's going to get broken/filthy/infested with sentient grit, so I've decided I have to make a...camera cozy, I guess.  </lj-cut>

"event","We had the pleasure of the company of <lj user=""rhiannonhero""> and Mr. Rhi for a snacky sort of dinner last night.  Both Rhi and I had long been convinced that Mr. R and Mr. G would like each other, as both are guitar-playing audio-geek fine-artist types with deadpan humor, and yesterday was the first time that everything worked out so that we could put them into a cage together to observe their behavior.  They started talking about speakers right away.  

I hadn't seen Rhi since October.  She accused me of being both short and greatly reduced in dimension which is 1) untrue, and 2) flattering and probably true.  The shortness was due to her high heels and my bare feet.  I was required to put on shoes to return balance to the universe.  She's so pretty! and so nice! I was overcome with the pleasure of being with her again, and because I hadn't seen her in so long, I was shy!  After I drank some wine, I relaxed ;)  

Rhi gave me a beautiful woodblock calendar (the very one I had been thinking about buying for myself) and loaned me books on ADD.  She also shared her Obi-Wan/Qui-Gon (is that his name? the Liam Neeson character) doujinshi, which was beautifully drawn and included everything possible in manga sex except for kitty ears.  I insisted on burning a bunch of manga on a disk for her, as well as the YnM anime series.  They had to leave way too soon, but I really don't see why they had to leave.  We have a guest room.  They could live here, after all.

<lj-cut text=""juvenilia""><b>juvenilia: </b>When I was 21, high-strung and feral, with hair to my waist and clumsy bruises all over my bare legs, I met Mr. Glove. At first, I thought he was a dork, but then I saw him in better light and realized that he was pretty. He was coy and resistant to my charms, which eventually became a little insulting.  I finally cornered him by the art studio at the college and stated my intentions with a directness that made his eyes go wide.  He seemed intrigued.  I thought I was getting somewhere with him, but then he succumbed to a fresh cycle of ex-girlfriend wallowing and we were back where we started.  

Early in 1988, he showed me a print he made.  Now when I look at it, I know what it ""really"" is (a section of highway), but I can also see what I saw at very first glance: a temple, falling down, not yet hitting the ground.  When I told him that, he seemed irritated at first, then...interested.  He posted a photo of that print on his non-Glove LJ today.  I referred to it as ""the temple,"" and he didn't know what I was talking about until I reminded him.  

For his 26th birthday that year, I wanted to give him something special, but I had no money, and what I had was spent on cigarettes, so I wrote him a story.  My roommate said, ""You should write something about a little green man.""  I have no idea where she got that idea, nor do I recall why I decided it was advice worth listening to.  My roommate also liked Mr. Glove very much.  We had quite the triangle going for awhile there.  

I put everything I knew about him into the story, and every conversation we'd had, and the temple, as well.  It was the first story I wrote for anyone.  It is still the only story that I've written for a specific person where I was able to be present during that first reading.  I was extremely nervous, and somewhat suspicious that my roommate had let me do something really stupid so as to improve her chances with Mr. G.  

I don't remember what he said, or what I said when he was done.  I do remember that he liked it a lot, and that my relief was like a flood.  I also remember my roommate interrupting our discussion to say, ""You, know, the little green man was <i>my</i> idea.""  

Mr. Glove had me dig the story out of my files today and then typed it into his computer.  He posted it over in his other journal, <lj user=""tubenerd"">, along with the photograph of the print, should you be interested in my juvenilia.  

Mr. Glove and I have known each other since October 1987, but we haven't been a couple all that time.  There were...let's call them breaks, of varying lengths and flavored with different degrees of animosity, and during the times when we were tentatively moving towards each other again, I would give him art and writing, usually mailed rather than hand-delivered.  I would know he'd gotten my missive when he'd show up with a look of fascinated terror on his face.  He always thought I might be telling him something evil rather than trying to woo him.  There was no reason for him to be afraid; the messages weren't that obscure, nor that deep.  

~~~

In the same old file box as the birthday story, I found a high-school art project with smart-ass notes from me to the art teacher drawn in, a large quantity of old fiction written on a typewriter, and a piece of notebook paper with a handwritten joke song called <i>Death Breakfast</i> that I wrote to impress Chuck, the cool guy who worked at the record shop (the first fag I ever hagged).  I found a folder containing saint cards (Catholic and Hindu both) and naked lady playing cards.  There was also a folder with a few half-finished ""tarot"" cards and a bunch of Xerox art made late at night at the 10-cents-per-copy machine at the supermarket.  Basically, it's a box of my late teens and very early 20s. I'm technically and structurally a better writer than that girl, and I'm also a better artist, improving with further years of practice, but we're very recognizably the same people, with the same urges and aesthetic.

The saint cards and naked lady playing cards are still very cool.</lj-cut>"

I woke up rested at 7:30 this morning, a half-hour before my take-a-pill alarm.  I fed all the pets, cleaned the guinea pig house, took the dog out for a long sniff-and-pee session.  I did some minor household chores because I actually <i>noticed</i> they needed doing.  I then <i>made a jacket</i> for Kicky's burlesque costume and did my first bagged lining (so easy! so cool!).  I do still have to decide what I want the collar to look like, but the jacket is otherwise done.  I've also had time to do my usual online perusals.  

Basically, I've gotten more done in the last three hours than I usually manage to do in an entire week.  Maybe even an entire month. I'm amazed.  I'm a little afraid that this is a fluke and I'll become useless again after a few days, but right now I'm really grateful for pills.  This is a gift.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""unexpected gift II""><b>unexpected gift II: </b>Mr. G interrupted me in the midst of writing the above to announce that Santa had brought me something. We haven't done presents in years, so I was surprised, to say the least.  

Back at the beginning of the month, we went to a friend's gallery opening and I fell in love with three photographs: lights on a ferris wheel, a carnival food booth, and star-shaped lights on a tilt-a-whirl.  We could have bought one of them easily but could't afford all three.  However, I really felt that there was no point in having just one without the other two - they weren't being sold as a triptych, but that's definitely what they were - so we passed.  Except not, because <strike>Mr. Glove</strike>, er, <i>Santa</i> brought them here for me.  Yay!

Mr. Glove has surprised me on Xmas before, actually.  The day is also known as Engagement Day in our house because that's when he proposed.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""burlesque eyes""><b>burlesque eyes:</b> So, this jacket that I'm working on? It's a bolero jacket which is all gold sequins on the outside, gold lame lining, and will have big, wide, cuffs and collar made out of ornate brocade.  The skirt is made of the brocade with big inserts of gold sequins, also lined with gold lame.  I've got gold lycra boy shorts done, as well.  Everything is so shiny, yet I'm thinking that it's tasteful and elegant, not garish and over-the-top.  This happened when I made the Carmen Miranda costume, too - sustained exposure making me think that huge expanses of sequins might be just the thing for a nice daytime look.  Logic tells me this opinion is wrong, but my eyes are dazzled.

"event","I have Xmas issues.  It's probably enough to know that without getting into specifics.  

Our first Xmas in Nashville, we didn't want to participate in the holiday, so we ignored it and all of its attendant schedule changes.  Like, say, the fact that the store that was open until midnight on the 23rd closes early on the 24th and isn't open at all on the 25th.  As of Xmas morning, we had no food in the house.  There was surliness all around.  We eventually got in the car and drove around looking for something that was open.  We looked unfestive and ugly, wearing mismatched pajamas and dirty hair, and we blamed each other with both word and pointed glares for the sucktasticness of the day.  Thanks a lot, Baby Jesus.  Finally, we found a place that was open: Krispy Kreme.  We drank surprisingly not-horrible coffee and ate cold doughnuts in sick-making quantities.  Even though it was food, I wasn't satisfied. KK doughnuts have a weird chemical taste, and that thing they call a cruller is a joke.

I think that was the year we had a tree, though.  

The next two years in Nashville, we made sure we had food in the refrigerator.  One of those years, we even fought about whether or not I would ever get over the absence of food in the fridge in 1999.  I think we saw a movie in 2001, but I don't remember what, and it could just as easily have been in 2000.  I want to say it was <i>Royal Tennenbaums</i> but I really don't know.

In 2002, I was living alone in Seattle.  I drove north to my parents' house which took about six hours instead of the usual 1-1/2 due to incomprehensibly huge volumes of traffic.  I watched part of <i>Ice Age</i> with my nephew and was amazed at all the homosexual innuendo.  That is a very gay film, though my sister-in-law rejected my assessment out of hand when it was offered.  The nadir of the visit was the universal agreement that I was the heaviest that anyone had seen me.  Which was true. I ate pie anyway. I definitely felt sorry for myself.  

Last year, I felt sorry for myself and watched both <i>Amelie</i> and <i>Hard Core Logo</i>.  The surliness + PJs theme reappeared.  Mr. Glove made me food and I was unappreciative and cranky.  

I think this year will be different ;)  Rhi and Mr. Rhi are going to be in Nashville visiting relatives and then visiting us!  I am very excited to be spending what is usually a contrary day, at best, with friends.  (Not that Mr. Glove isn't my friend, but in the manner of many ungrateful spouses, I basically decide he doesn't count as one when the truth of the matter gets in the way of me wallowing in self-pity.)  We will have pie and chocolate and real food, as well.  Also wine.  I'm feeling oddly positive.  It's quite pleasant. 

The refrigerator is full this year.  I checked."

"event","Snagged from <lj user=""shaggirl""> - <lj-cut text=""year-end writing round-up""><b>Stories I wrote (and posted):</b> 8 Smallville, 2 Yami no Matsuei, 1 Ai no Kusabi. 

<b>My favorite:</b>  Either <i>White Bees & Sunflowers</i> (SV) or <i>Otsuya</i> (YnM)at the moment.

<b>My best:</b>  <i>White Bees & Sunflowers</i>.  I'm also proud of <i>Huitlacoche</i> (SV) because of the challenges I set for myself in writing it. 

<b>Story most underappreciated by the universe, in my opinion:</b>  In actuality, none. In the light of my grasping, divaish need, all of them.  

I do know that my version of <i>a</i> (as opposed to <i>the</i>) Bruce Wayne was annoying/confusing/unrecognizable to a great number of comics fans.  That's not so much the stories being unappreciated as me coming up against certain facts of fandom and losing.  I really like the stories, but I can understand why others didn't.

<b>Most fun story:</b> Hmmm, if we're talking about ""fun to read,"" I don't think I wrote any fun things this year :)  No silly stories, no parodies, no humor.  However, if the question is actually ""fun to write,"" I loved writing <i>White Bees & Sunflowers</i> and <i>Raping a Slave</i> (AnK).  WB&S had the dream sequences and the fairy tale story, and RaS was melodramatic smut.  Anime fic is fun to write because most source material has so much built-in, canonical melodrama that actually needs toning down to read as even remotely possible.

<b>Sexiest story:</b> <i>Raping a Slave</i> was definitely the dirtiest.  <i>Otsuya</i> was the most romantic and the sex was written accordingly.

<b>Story with single sexiest moment:</b>  One of the above, probably, depending on whether you like non-con or emotional sex scenes better.

<b>Hardest story to write:</b>  The ones that were started and remain unfinished. Of the finished pieces, <i>Huitlacoche</i> was the most troublesome because aspects of canon kept changing while I wrote, and then a canon character briefly developed the ability to ascertain truths, and I just about gave up since my plot, as such, had been used.  Except not really.  And then I calmed down and finished the story.

<b>Most unintentionally telling story:</b> <i>White Bees & Sunflowers</i> is not <i>unintentionally</i> telling, but I think it's the most telling.  Dreams, fairy tales, stream-of-consciousness, conclusions drawn from inference rather than solidity, and porn.  All my favorite things without the negatives that do show in other stories.  For instance, I wrote <i>Huitlacoche</I> based on things people said they hated in fic, just to prove that I could get people to read and enjoy things they claimed to hate.  It was a fun challenge, and I really like the way the story turned out, but it was written with a lot of expectations and ego weighing on it, which isn't necessarily the best way to write. </lj-cut>

If you write fanfic and haven't done this meme yet, I would encourage you to do so.  I love knowing what other writers think of their own work."

<lj-cut text=""sometimes I just start typing and don't know what I'm going to say - or - fumbling art share with a brief TMI"">

<b>art, purpose, interactivity and response: </b>Tell me something that interests me and we might never ""discuss"" it, but I'll research and poke and walk the perimeter until I can come away with my own piece of the puzzle you've presented. So, this exchange <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/velvetglove/205491.html?thread=2500019#t2500019""> here</a> led me to look for a clearer image (as yet unfound) and ultimately, <a href=""http://www.davidsmithestate.org/statements.html"">here</a>, where the following questions got under my skin, easily adapted to writing as well as visual arts:

<ul>
<li> How do you spend your time? More talking about art than making it?  </li>
<li> <b>Do you think your work should hold within tradition?</b> </li>
<li> Do you trust your first response, or do you go back and equivocate consciously? Do you believe that the freshness of first response can be developed and sustained as a working habit? </li>
<li> When you accept the identification of artist do you acknowledge that you are issuing a world challenge in your own time?</li>
<li> How long will you work before you work with the confidence which says, <i>What I do is art</i>? </li>
<li> Do you think acclaim can help you? Can you trust it, for you know in your secret self how far short of attainment you always are? Can you trust any acclaim any farther than adverse criticism? Should either have any effect upon you as an artist?</li>
</ul>

The bit about holding with tradition is like a burr, and the rest is a challenge.  If I tell myself that the story I want to write is too unlike anything already in existence, and thus will never be published, then I don't have to write it.  But then I also remember the incredible sense of possibility I felt when I read <i>Neuromancer</i>, and recall the (r)evolution that occurred in the sci-fi genre (at the very least) because of that book.  

And then I started thinking about art response, and how the response itself is, of course, part of the art.  Years ago, Mr. Glove and I went to a Very Important Show of art by young persons.  Included in the show was a (needlessly, cheerfully) large machine, furnacelike and sprawling, which served a single purpose: blowing sheets of 8-1/2 x 11 paper up toward the ceiling to see-saw down to the tile floor, skidding underfoot.  Mr. G kicked a pile of random, loose sheets as if they were dry fall leaves and, much to our surprise, the exhibit security asked us to leave.  

My visit to the Guggenheim this past May was a hoot for many reasons, but what I found oddest was the absolute novelty of the small amount of interactivity available in the face of such temptingly inert art.  I so wanted to fuck shit up, and I can't believe that feeling wasn't prevalent.  Among the heaped goods (hazelnut pollen, sugar, or salt [twice] in tidy pyramids of sizes from tiny to ton), colored lightbulbs, and slabs of sheet metal lying in carefully taped-off sections of floor, there was a nook filled with wrapped hard candies strewn across the dusty floor.  The plaque explicating the piece (all about endless abundance, or so we were told) encouraged viewers to take candy.  My friends and I took candy, and the high school kids there on a field trip warned us with loud glee that we shouldn't bother to eat it because it sucked.  

Mr. G and I saw a Joseph Beuys exhibit in, of all places, a shopping mall.  The museum in Bellevue, WA, is in the very upscale mall, which is basically the downtown for the city, so I guess it makes sense.  Beuys' art often looks like scrap paper with faint doodles, but it does grow on you.  At first glance, they might appear to be the handiwork of a particularly beloved retarded child, but a playful sense of menace eventually takes over. Beuys used a peculiar selection of art supplies - beeswax, felt, a strange ""ink"" made from dirt and detritus, various fats - as well as more traditional materials.  Organic and messy things.  After spending quite some time in the exhibit, becoming more and more excited by what were basically grease stains and scribbles (and knowing this, and still being excited), we passed through a ""response"" room before hitting the gift shop (yes, we bought a book).  To record one's response, there were pencils and a ream of white paper on a folding table.  I had just reached the end of my period and, in a moment of inspiration, I stuck my hand under my skirt, smeared a faint bloodstain on a sheet of paper and pinned it to the wall among the earnest, handwritten critiques.  I like to think Beuys would have been amused.  

This is the image that I intended to be the inspiration for my wedding flowers, <i>Judith</i> by Yasumasa Morimura.  This was done sometime in the early 1990s.  Morimura took pictures of himself, almost always in the guise of a woman, as the central figure in famous (and a few obscure) paintings.  Since then, he's branched out into actresses of various eras, and a truly horrifying dual portrait of Madonna and Jacko.  He's lumped together in my head with Cindy Sherman for obvious reasons.    

<center><img src=""http://www.crayons-to-perfume.com/pix/Judith.jpg""></center>

In addition to the photograph, I also gave the florists what has, over time, become my standard speech about flowers being the sex organs of plants and how prominent that is for me in terms of their appeal.  I think they wanted to cancel with us right then and there, but we found out later we were their first big, paying job and they didn't want to pass it up just because I was scary.  As it was, they did really lovely flowers, although not...brutal enough for me.  Not wet enough, and odorless, too.  

I had never seen the original until I went looking for it today, and here it is, painted in 1530 by Lucas Cranach the Elder.  Oh my god.  I am so glad Morimura had <i>his</i> art response, because I hate this painting:

<center><img src=""http://www.crayons-to-perfume.com/pix/CranachJudith250.jpg""></center>

And it occurs to me that perhaps Morimura made Judith a cabbage and Holofernes a potato because this particular J + H image is so fucking bloodless.  She's a bored, Saxon princess in heavy bling who's too polite to say that this severed head business isn't really to her taste.  He looks stoned primarily, beheaded second.  <a href=""http://courses.washington.edu/danz/wi03/images/judith_beheading_holofernes_caravaggio_1598.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Caravaggio's foxy Judith</a> looks a bit dubious about the undertaking, while the <a href=""http://courses.washington.edu/danz/wi03/images/judith_holofernes_gentileschi_2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">capable Gentileschi version</a> seems resigned to slaughtering troublesome livestock, but they both seem at least <i>possible</i> saviors of Israel.  

Not only do I like the Morimura version better, it's also much more fun to say Yasumasa Morimura (so bouncy!) aloud than Lucas Cranach, which is certainly a major factor in my critique.

And, yeah, I didn't know where I was going with this, but at least I went.</lj-cut>"

I went and picked him up this afternoon, and let him ride mostly in my lap on the way home, even though that's obviously a bad idea all around.  He's very cuddly.  

We picked Mr. Glove up from work and Casey sat in his lap for a change.  

These pictures are the result of some very hectic play in the kitchen.  Unfortunately, the camera refused to work while Casey was rocketing straight up in the air after the elusive spit-soaked blue fur doughnut, but at least we got a good crazy tugging picture ;)

So far, he loves to be brushed, doesn't quite understand the treat-stuffed Kong toy concept, is a little intimidated by the birds (excellent!), and is frightened of the stairs.  He has never lived inside a house before, though the kennel he's been in for the last ten months does have an indoor section.  He's doing okay with the few stairs down into the back yard, but he's very wary of going down the comparatively long inside stairs.  He's going to have to get used to them, since I spend most of my time upstairs.  

He really, really, really needs a bath, which I am going to try to take care of before Xmas.  I have been petting him so much that I reek of dirty dog - much more than he does, actually.

They're having a ""guilty pleasures"" theme at the moment, and I posted the songs behind the cut...

<lj-cut text=""guilty pleasure songs"">This is the post I made there:
<blockquote><b>guilty pleasures</b>  I'm new to this community, and I've already rediscovered several shameful favorites in the posts today.   Actually, I'm not a person who feels much guilt about musical taste.  I do, after all, have a domain named after a line in Lulu's <i>To Sir With Love</i>...

<a href=""http://www.crayons-to-perfume.com/singsong/Belfegore - All That I Wanted.mp3""><b>Belfegore - All That I Wanted</b></a> - In the mid-80s, I used to frequent a scummy ""goth"" dance club in Vancouver, B.C., called Luv-A-Fair.  Circa approximately 1986, you might have found me on the Luv-A-Fair dancefloor in pointy Fluevog boots and a big, black pancake hat (yes, a hat, indoors, in a nightclub) doing spooky gyrations to this song.  It's not even dance music, really.  It's metal cheeze by failing-to-cross-over Germans.  It almost rawks!!!

<a href=""http://www.crayons-to-perfume.com/singsong/Kylie Minogue - Cant Get You Out Of My Head.mp3""><b>Kylie Minogue - Cant Get You Out Of My Head</b></a> - I'd only even heard of Kylie Minogue because she did a duet with Nick Cave on his <i>Murder Ballads</i> album.  I was not impressed with her voice on that track - and I'm still not impressed with her voice.  It doesn't matter, though, because this song is like hiccups you can't get rid of.  Plus, whenever I hear it, I picture her ""performing"" it on Saturday Night Live with her Human-League-robot dance team, host Ian McKellen doing a form of chair-dancing off to the side, and it makes me happy.

<a href=""http://www.crayons-to-perfume.com/singsong/Neil Diamond - Cracklin Rosie.mp3""><b>Neil Diamond - Cracklin Rosie</b></a> - What the hell kind of nickname is Cracklin' Rosie, anyway?  It doesn't seem like a complimentary thing to call a girl.  Still, this song used to drive me wild with excitement when I was kindergarten age.  I recall running around the living room in my nightgown in some semblance of rhythm, wild-eyed and breathless in hectic ecstasy. These days, I'm just not feeling the frenzy, though I am still fond of the song.  After all, I went out of my way to track down a .mp3 of the damn thing.   

And, finally, the perfect prom song circa mid-80s: <a href=""http://www.crayons-to-perfume.com/singsong/Spandau Ballet - True.mp3""><b>Spandau Ballet - True</b></a>  Swoony, melodramatic, overwrought <small>but still kinda gorgeous</small>.</blockquote></lj-cut>

I really don't have a lot of song guilt.  I genuinely love a lot of things that are apparently high cheese, but I don't understand why.  For instance, Petula Clark's <i>Downtown</i>.  What's wrong with it?  It's expansive, celebratory, catchy and happy, and it's well-done on all levels.  Plus, there's old footage of Petula lipsynching it on the Ed Sullivan show with a big, blonde beehive in a little, black dress all alone on a bare stage - I like it because she seems so oddly brave trying to fill that space with the spread of her skinny, girlie arms.  

I don't think that music has to be obscure to be good (a lot of obscure music is obscure for a reason) but I do think that anyone who believes they actually care about music owes it to him or herself to go beyond what commercial radio has on offer.  And here's where I erased a long diatribe about what's good and what sucks because I was just saying elsewhere yesterday that fighting over aesthetic choices is pretty much pointless.  But let me just say, if you love Good Charlotte, you really need to listen to more music ;)"

Most of the ones I thought would be easy were unguessed.  I thought for sure someone would recognize the <i>Ted Nugent</i> song and ding me for being 1) a dork and 2) old.  Keep in mind that Ted was not known to be a right-wing, bow-hunting nutjob back when the song was new, try not to listen too hard to the lyrics, and it's pretty sexy.  I mean, it even includes a bit of a Ravel homage, if I'm not mistaken.  If, like me, you have seen the terrible Mark Wahlberg/Jennifer Aniston movie, <i>Rockstar</i> literally dozens of times on cable, you will note that the producers found it sexy enough to use in the scene where the happy couple start making out with strangers and Ms. A eventually loses her macrame dress so that everyone can orgy.  

You just really lost a lot of respect for me there, didn't you?

"event","Hey hey hey!
   whats been going on all you crazy pepole? Not too much has happened here, other than the day after I got back from Washington I drove up to Helena to see Kat and did, YAY!! ( Love you Kat!! ) I also saw Nels there too which was cool, I hadn't seen him for a while, so we hung out for a while, that was fun. Went up to his place in Boulder. Not a bad little place, just the road is terrible, OMG. So yeah, then we went back into Helena after he and Eric...talked... and picked up a friend of his and drove around some and went to Anchor and left there because everyone was either high or drunk or both, so we left. Then we went to Ambers house...eh... thats all I have to say about that. SO yeah. then we drove around a little in Nels's car and had left mine at Friendly's and then came back a while later and I headed home ( it was abotu 1:30 ) so that was interesting, but it was allright, I had cigs so I that gave me something to do other than drive. I got home around 3 since I wasn't really in a hurry.

   Nothing much has really happened since untill last night when I went to the fair ( Rockin' Ride that K99 puts on ) It was great. Did some rides, drank a lot of liquids, saw a lot of people I knew, it was nuts. and walk aroudn the little shops, and then went Dancing, that was so much fun. Normally I don't dance around other people, let alone in a large crowd of people I don't know, and a few that I do, but last night I didn't care, I just did it, even though I swear I suck at it.. I dunno, it was fun though. I had a blast.

Well I am off, byes

"event","Hey all, whats up
WEll as you all know I hav been flat on my back with mono, so not fun. Ugh, but on the plus side I have gotten to spend quality time with my folks, who cares if I am vomiting some of the time though. Anyways so yeah, but the other day I had to pick up my best friend Ivory from her Choir camp at flathead lake, god that was interesting. I got abotu 3 hours of sleep before I woke up at 4:30am and got all my shit and got out to my car and got gas and left at 5:00 am ( not bad if I say so myself ) and was readin my map for the millionth time, and I was driving and driving, about 250 miles in about 3.5 hours or so, something like that, was too bad, a bit cold but I knew it was going to get so hot later on I soaked it in. It was so weird and kinda freaky because that was the first trip I had taken by myself, at least that far, I mean Helena had been the farthest I had gone without my family, but this was a enw record, but I was excited, me and Tawanda were road tripping, hell yeah. And she did great Imight add, not one problem the whole time. So I got there, finally, that place she was at was the hardest place to find the sign was at the road you turned at when you are going like 70, good planning folks, I meant he writing wasn't even big, small letters on a small sign. So I get there after turning around and then I am driving aruond this camp place ( after getting stuck because of some damn truck taking up the whole road jsut sitting there talking ) and everyone was in yellow shirts so I was like holy shit am I in the right place? and I didn't see Ivory or anything so I was freaking out and then I drove through a second time and finally saw her and so I saw her sing and all that was there a few hours adn then we drove home and OMG  Iw as right it was fucking hot. I mean when you rolled downt he windows and the air was fucking hot. I sweat so much it looked like someone hosed down my seat. Disgusting I know. and so I got to Gt Falls 12 hours and 15 min later ( but I had to take her to Belt ) so I got home about 30, 40 min later. but yeah, about 500 miles in around 12, 13 hours. I went home ate and then fell asleep for abotu 12, 13 hours, and omg did it feel good to sleep."

"event","WELL! This certainly has been an interesting time. Since I have posted last I have gotten to blow things up, nearly been killed by 2 rouge fireworks, turned 17, gone camping, mono signs started while camping, and yeah...doesn't sound like too many things, but OMG the mono...My throat was so sore and so swollen that it hurt so bad to eat or drink ( because I had to swollow ) that I didn't not even my own spit, got a bucket. Thats how bad that was, and not to mention the fevers, that I got over and over, and the dehydration, and the small ability to do shit about it, and the 6 week high risk of rupturing my spleen for whatever reason.Oh god then there is the sinus infection and the headaches that come with it, jeses christ! I must have taken 30 showers in a week because they were the only thing that helped me feel better for a little while, aside from sleep but waking up was bad, almost choking on saliva, my tonge so dry it litterally feels like sand paper, things like that. Wow...turning 17 really sucks. Oh yeah and the fireworks thing well 1 was an artileryshell that was done wrong so it got about 3 feet from the ground spun and blew up while I was right there, that was fuckin odd. then one of thsoe diamond things that fly nearly shot me in the head, good thing I was on my feet from the art shell. OOOOOO!!! I got new tires for my car for my B-day :-D White walls, they are perdy. My old ones were so bad that they were on 1% tred, all the belts were snapped in each one, the car litterally wabbled when it drove, there was a nail or screw in each one.....need I continue? And yet I never had a problem. Talk about a good driver, or just dumb luck. so yeah. anyways, I am goin to bed, night night, and  Kat, I hope you read this and if you do e-mail me because I will be commin up soon and I wanna see ya :-D Me an Tawnada Both do

"event","Well hello once again boys and girls.
I just got back from my 3 day trip to Belt, again, and it was interesting as always, Ivory was paranoid about moving out the whole damn time and keeps asking me if she is doing the right thing and all that, I dunno. That girl is crazy. But yeah, today before I left I had to help move all her damn furniture into her new place, large, heavy and awkward shaped things in a small door and awkward porch. Talk about a pain in the ass. But I got a shower after words so I felt pretty good after that. Came back home and then saw Hayle that was fun. We went to her house at 11pm and had some of her brothers BBQ ( they had nothing better to do ) good hotdog though. Then we set off fire works in the street, and  some loud ones at the Bitch Next Door's house, then set off an artilery shell, and did that as we walked around then block and some other bitch comes out in her bathrobe yelling some incoherent non=sense about turning the fire crackers off before she calls the cops. I wanted to and should have yelled ""Not in that bathrobe your not!"" but I didn't, oh well. I will get over it. So I think I am going to goto bed soon. M'kay, nite nite

"event","Holy shit, ok,  today has been an allright day, I got up early too my mom to work took ehr car to get fixed got  a ride home took them van to get fixed, got a ride back and rightaway had to get my moms car again, then a little break, then the van. Kinda busy, but not bad at all. hungout with Hayle and all. Then someone knocks on the door, and it is a kid Chris I know from like elementary school. I see him at school every now and then ( highschool now I would like to point out ) and he is asking about some Nintendo that I borrowed, 4, 5 years ago because his dad wants it back. Well hmm...I remember in vivd detail having a conversation with him years ago about 4 actually, saying that his dad wanted it back and that he needed to come up and get it. I said well I have to go though because my dad and I are going somewhere... so he said well ok, put it all in a bag and put it on the porch. well ok, so I did, and when my dad and I got back the bad was gone. Logical assumption - Chris got the bag. Well I guess that isn't the case...4 years later I find this out... why wasn't I confonted like 4 fucking years ago? Anyways, I remind Chris of this and he says oh yeah, ok I will talk to you later then. and he left, ok. So I am sittin down here singin to music and shit and my dad calls down sayin his dad is hear. I just thought to myself well this should be interesting, but if I remember he is a logical resonable guy. Well I get up there and explain to him what happend, so he goes on a kick about how it wasn't Chris's but his ( I don't think I said it was Chris's....nope didn't ever ) and so he is just gonna have to ""take it in the shorts"" so I apologized like 20 times as he is disrespecting me in my own fucking house. Blaming me saying its my fault it got stolen for doing what I was fucking told. Oh and that Chris has been trying to ever to get that from me and I have been, blowing him off, hmm ok, odd how that works since I have talked to him on many occasions and given him rides home from school and what not like that. Not once had he mentioned it...and also that doesn't sound like I am blowing him off, does it? But so yeah, he is trying to get something because he just keeps repeating him self and I am running out of patience because he is acting like I sold the damn thing or am simply not giving it to him, like I am holding it randsom. so he just says ""So that is what I get then, huh? I try to be a nice guy and help the kids out and they screw me over everytime. and YOU as the father ( to my dad ) Should offer to replace it, or at least that is what I would do. but thats just me. Oh well, thats what I get for being nice.. He then walks out, which was good because I was losing my patience VERY fast and was about to tell him to stop fuckign disrespecting me in my own fucking house. I have alwasy shown him respect in his house and had up untill that point been showing him respect. here is the kicker, I  have 2 playstaions, right? Both work. Well maybe had he not been such an asshole I would have brought that up and asked if he wanted one of those instead...Hmmm well nah, he was bein a dick so no need to mention it. So now I am really fucking paranoid about my car. I am so sure he or Chris is going to do something do it. And if I find one thing done it I will call the fucking cops so fast because it would be way to conicidental for my tastes. yup. Well I am done venting now, still pissed off though. I mean shit, lets just wait 4 fucking years."

"event","WEll Hello, just me as usual. I am so un beliveably depressed today, and I don't know what triggered it, but who knows. But yeah, I have just been really sluggish and very passive all day, and just very...non-responsive, and I have nothing going through my head, and that is odd since I usualyl always do. all I have right now are memories of good and band things from the past, just playing through my head like a movie in a movie theater. Yeah, today has just been bad, since it was fathers day I was trying to be home, but I was in Belt so I had told people that I needed to be back early because I wanted to spend time with my dad. Sure no problem. Well it kinda turned into one, but in the end I got to use Ivory's car and come down here, but when I get here my folks are no where to be found. So I was here for a while they were, as it turns out, at Applebee's. Oh well. So I got some money and got gas for her car adn some food and had Hayle follow me to Belt so I could a ride back. So we did that. Then we drove around and hung out with people. That was pretty fun. I would say that was definately the time when I was the most responsive. I was laughing and shit, but I wasn't really happy. I just am so tired of everything. I wish I could press reset and try it all again. I wish I could just kill myself and that no-one would care, because then I could do it with a clear concious. But unfortunately it would affect other people. At times though, I don't really care I get dangerously close. Today isn't quite one of those days, but it is in the vacinity. I dunno. I am just so blah. Goodnight

"event","Well hello there, it has been a while thats for sure. Things have been so crazy, so I might as well start from the top. As ya'll know I don't have my car, so still having arguments over that, and so Nels and Eric came up here and got me and tooke me to Helena. It was only supposed to be for a day or two, but that kinda backfired so I was there for over a week, mind you I am not complaining because I enjoyed spending that time with Nels. The only problem with me being gone so long was that I need to be in Gt Falls because I needed to get some community service done before I went to PRIDE WEEKEND and maybe even get some money for it and possibally the money for my car insurance, but that didn't happen, so I now have 19.5 hours of community service to complete by monday. Its do able so I am not worrying I just have to do 5 hours a day for 4 days. It will kinda suck, but ohwell, 1-6pm I can deal with that. I pulled longer shifts at B.K. At Salvation army I do practically nothing, I do get bored and that kinda sucks, but its ok, and I really hate mopping ( thanks BK ) and I had to do that today, so I kinda did a chinsy job on it, because it hurts my back and I just plain hate it. Anywho, back to the weekend; So I was in Helena had a little bit of drama but we dont' need to go into that, and then later me and Nels got into an argument and all that, but we talked it out and what not, so it was all good. Then we went to Pride Weekend which was really fun. It was my first gay activity and I loved being around so many gay people ( except when they were drunk and hitting on me telling me that I am the hottest one there, and I have beautiful glasses. Yeah Right ) And then Nels and I once again got into an argument so I, last night, decided we shoudl break up, at least for now, because I have too much going on here in Gt Falls and too much on my mind and everything else, so I just need to take some me time, and not worry about anyone else. I have been doing that since I have had my car and I need a break. It makes it a lot easier because I don't have my car, so I really don't have to worry about it at all. But it also sucks at the same time because I need my car for community service, and I cannot use it or any other car in the house so it makes it difficult, other wise I would have started the other day or two and had to work less hours, but ohwell. My bad on that. So yeah, now I am single, doing community service, and car-less. Woo-hoo get me while you can. Yeah, as if. I don't think I will be doing any dating or anything like that for quite a while. Yeah, so thats the exciting world of Kyle right now. I will talk at you later."

Yeah, thats realistic. I will just find a job at all the thriving businesses around my house. Sure mom. And so I asked her if she would pay for like a month's worth of insurance and I would pay her back on my first paycheck. Of course the answer was no because she is a royal bitch. She wont even let my drive my car. I don't see why not, it is my ass if I get pulled over for doing something stupid. Then she is bringing up the shit about the car still being hers because it is still in my dads and her name so they still have ownership and will report it stolen if I drive it anywhere. What kind of shit is that? Oh and that the only reaon I still have my car is because of my dad and that he feels sorry. Otherwise the car would have been sold by now. GOD IJUST REALLY FUCKIGN HATE HER SOMETIMES!!!

Anyways, that is my little vent for now. Imight add onto this later today. hard to tell. I am goin to a movie with my dad. Later

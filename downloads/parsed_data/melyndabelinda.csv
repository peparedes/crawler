Angela, the woman I&nbsp;spoke with, suggested we get started on the preliminary paperwork.&nbsp; To me that sounds vaguely daunting.&nbsp; I also need to procure a recent copy of my baptismal certificate from the church I&nbsp;was originally Baptized at.&nbsp; For this I&nbsp;must call my mother.

At least now I&nbsp;feel like I'm actually doing something constructive."

"event","Truong and I&nbsp;planned to go look at Wedding Invitations/&quot;Save the Date&quot;s this weekend because I&nbsp;want to send the &quot;Save the Date&quot;s as soon as we have the church reserved.&nbsp; We're asking nearly everyone to travel for this wedding and we want to give them as much notice as possible.&nbsp; 

Sadly, it appears that the Stationary shops are only open M-Sat., which is not exactly ideal.&nbsp; Sunday is the only day both of us currently have off together.&nbsp; It looks like if we want to be able to look at this stuff together he's going to have to pick me up from work on Wednesday (his other day off)&nbsp;and go straight to the stores, as they all close at 7pm.

My other big irritant being that St. Bernadette in Seattle never called me back last week and St. Laurence in Sugar Land will not allow us to reserve our wedding day until they receive notice from St. Bernadettes that we've started our pre-marital classes here.&nbsp; I am going to call the woman here again this morning but if she is as uncertain and disorganized as she was last week I'm not holding out much hope.

I&nbsp;suppose if worse comes to worse I can find another Catholic church in Seattle to work with.&nbsp; It just seemed logical to go to St. Bernadettes, as they're the closest to us and the one that we attend mass at.

I told Truong last night that I&nbsp;have a feeling I'll be gray by the time we actually get married."

"event","I&nbsp;haven't written in this journal for months.&nbsp; Or any journal for that matter, as this is the only journal I've ever kept.&nbsp; I think it's because I&nbsp;don't feel like I've had anything useful or interesting to say.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know this is supposed to be my journal to write about whatever, but I&nbsp;can never make myself forget that I&nbsp;have an audience, and I&nbsp;always feel like whatever I write should entertain them.

I am not particularly entertaining, but oh well.

I&nbsp;am engaged!&nbsp; 

It didn't come as a giant surprise. I've been waiting with increasing impatience for over a year now.&nbsp; Either way, though, I'm increadibly happy.&nbsp; I've known I wanted to marry Truong for many years.

We're planning to get married in October of 2011.&nbsp; I was leaning toward October 8th but I&nbsp;have since discovered that it's the day of the UT/OU game.&nbsp; I may have to move my wedding one week back.&nbsp; Is that bad?&nbsp; The game is usually in the morning though, and my wedding wouldn't be until 2pm, so I&nbsp;guess I&nbsp;don't really need to move it.&nbsp; I'll have to decide later.

And, despite having about 18 months to plan, I&nbsp;feel like I've made a good start.&nbsp; I have already called the church in Sugar Land I plan to get married in and put a tentative hold on my date. &nbsp;They won't put it firmly on the schedule until we start our pre-marital classes at the Catholic church up here in Seattle.&nbsp; I've also called the church here to get the ball rolling with them, but sadly the people in the office are not as organized and knowledgable as the girl I&nbsp;talked to at St. Laurence so I'm still waiting for a call back.

I've also looked online for possible reception venues. &nbsp;I need to call them and make appointments to view them at the end of May when I'm in Houston for my dad's 60th birthday.&nbsp; I&nbsp;can already tell that planning a wedding long distance is a giant hassle, but I still can't imagine getting married anywhere else but Texas.

Truong and I went looking at wedding rings last Sunday for fun. &nbsp;I mean honestly, jewelry shopping is by far the best part of this... besides the actual marriage itself.&nbsp; Truong even found a ring he liked, but the woman at the Zales was VERY&nbsp;unhelpful. &nbsp;I want to keep looking for that reason alone, and I&nbsp;hope if he does decide on that ring we can find a different Zales to actually purchase it from. &nbsp;I&nbsp;was not impressed with the service at the Southcenter location.

I'm still not sure what type of ring I&nbsp;want yet.&nbsp;

I plan to look at invitations/&quot;save the date&quot;s this weekend.&nbsp; As soon as the church is booked I'm sending out the &quot;save the date&quot;s.&nbsp; Pretty much everyone I&nbsp;know is going to have to travel for this wedding and I&nbsp;want to give them plenty of time to save up for it.

I have a feeling I will be updating LJ&nbsp;more often in the next 18 months.&nbsp;"

"event","For those of you who don't know (and you should!), tonight is the big National Championship game between the #1 ranked Alabama Crimson Tide and the #2 ranked University of Texas Longhorns.&nbsp; Most people I&nbsp;have talked to (other than the Longhorn faithful) believe that Texas doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of winning this football game.

To all you doubters out there, here are a few reasons why you shouldn't count Texas out so soon:

Fact #1- Texas has NEVER lost in the Rose Bowl. True, they've only been twice, but I bet there is no other team in the country who has actually played in the Rose Bowl and can make that claim.

Fact #2- Texas has NEVER lost to Alabama. They've played one another 8 times in the past and their record is 7-0-1. A tie isn't a win, but it's not a loss either.

Fact #3- Everyone expects Texas to lose.  In 2005 everyone expected Texas to lose too... USC&nbsp;had the game called before the fourth quarter even began but if you look up '2005 NCAA&nbsp;Football National Champion' you will not find USC&nbsp;listed.

Fact #4- An Alabama player won the Heisman this year. In the last 13 years only one team with the current Heisman winner on it has won the National Championship if they played in it. In 2004 Matt Leinhart won for USC and USC also won the national title. But in 2005 when Reggie Bush, also from USC, won the Heisman and they played in the National Championship... 

For other examples of Heisman winners who lost National Championships see:

2008: Sam Bradford of OU- lost to Florida in the National Championship 
2006: Troy Smith of Ohio State- lost to Florida in the National Championship
2005: Reggie Bush of USC- lost to UT in the National Championship
2003: Jason White of OU- lost to LSU in the National Championship
2001: Eric Crouch of Nebraska- lost to Miami in the National Championship 
2000: Chris Weinke of Florida State- lost to OU in the National Championship

Needless to say I&nbsp;have no doubts that this time tomorrow I&nbsp;will be saying &quot;I told you so!&quot; to a great many people."

Anderson - I keep reading these books because I love Dune so much, despite the fact that they aren't very good.</li><li><em>The Golden Compass</em>, by Phillip Pullman - I enjoyed this movie so I&nbsp;thougth I'd give the book a try. &nbsp;I enjoyed it more than I&nbsp;expected to.</li><li><em>The Subtle Knife</em>, by Phillip Pullman - The story of Lyra and her demon got a lot weirder in this book.&nbsp; I liked the book when I&nbsp;finished it, but in retrospect I'm not so sure I'd recommend it to anyone.</li><li><em>The Amber Spyglass</em>, by Phillip Pullman - I did not like the conclusion of this series.&nbsp; The religious undertones slapped me in the face in this book and I&nbsp;had serious problems with the message I felt the author was trying to convey.</li><li><em>The Demon's Lexicon</em>, by Sarah Rees Brennan - I&nbsp;picked this book up because I&nbsp;read the author's blog and enjoy it immensely. &nbsp;It started out sort of slow but I&nbsp;liked the end and intend to read the next installment in the series.</li><li><em>Brisingr</em>, by Christopher Paolini - This is the third book in the series that began with <em>Eragon</em>. &nbsp;I loved the first two books but had a hard time getting into this one. &nbsp;I don't know if it was just slower than the others or if, during the wait between books, I&nbsp;lost the thread of the story.&nbsp; I&nbsp;plan to read the conclusion to the series though, as I&nbsp;feel invested in the characters.</li><li><em>Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife</em>, by Linda Berdoll - I was at a loss for what to read and picked this up from one of the little display tables at Barnes and Noble.&nbsp; They should have classified this in the Romance section, not as literature, as the book was basically about Darcy and Elizabeth having sex.</li><li><em>Darcy and Elizabeth:&nbsp;Nights and Days at Pemberly</em>, by Linda Berdoll - Clearly I&nbsp;enjoyed the first book enough to buy the second.&nbsp; I chock it up to needing brain candy.</li><li><em>Naamah's Kiss</em>, by Jacqueline Carey - I love this author and she could write about leaves growing and I&nbsp;would read it.&nbsp; Go buy her books!&nbsp; They're in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy section.</li><li><em>The Winds of Dune</em>, by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson - Again, I&nbsp;can't help but buy these books.&nbsp; I do not mean to imply that you should buy them.</li><li><em>Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone</em>, by J.K. Rowling - I&nbsp;need to read these books once a year for my mental well being.</li><li><em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em>, by J.K. Rowling - Please see above.</li><li><em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>, by J.K. Rowling - This is still my favorite!&nbsp; The first 50ish pages have finally given up the ghost and fallen out.</li><li><em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em>, by J.K. Rowling - Please refer to HP:SS.</li><li><em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</em>, by J.K.&nbsp;Rowling - While not my favorite, I&nbsp;still think this was probably the most well written book in the series.</li><li><em>Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</em>, by J.K. Rowling - Yay Draco, finally get some dimension!</li><li><em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em>, by J.K. Rowling - I&nbsp;still cry at the end.</li><li><em>Chronicles of the Black Company</em>, by Glen Cook - I&nbsp;picked this book up randomly and plan to read everything this author has written I&nbsp;loved it so much.</li><li><em>The Books of the South:&nbsp;Tales of the Black Company</em>, by Glen Cook - I&nbsp;really thought the story was over at the end of the last book. &nbsp;I love the way he was able to pick it back up and keep going without feeling like the story was forced.</li><li><em>Best Served Cold</em>, by Joe Abercrombie - I&nbsp;read the author's First Law series last year and really enjoyed it. &nbsp;This book stands alone but borrows some minor characters from the previous books and occurs later chronologically.&nbsp; I think this is the best of the four books he's written and highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor.</li></ol></lj-cut><br /><br />I plan to continue tracking my reading list in 2010.&nbsp; Hopefully the activity will encourage me to read more.<br /><br />If anyone has any books they'd like to recommend I am always open to suggestion.&nbsp; As you can probably tell from the 2009 reading list I&nbsp;have a strong preference for Fantasy."

"event","Truong and I&nbsp;have been taking Zoe to obedience classes every Wednesday night for the last month.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't know what I&nbsp;was expecting, maybe that they'd turn her into a marvel of docility overnight or something, but what I'm actually getting is quite different and surprising.

They're not training her for us, much to Truong's initial displeasure, they're teaching us techniques to train her ourselves.&nbsp; I&nbsp;read through the manual they gave us the first night and thought to myself that we would never get her to do half the things they were describing.

We've been working with her on various items since then. &nbsp;Some of it is pretty basic stuff, like sit and roll over.&nbsp; I was really astonished, though, last week in class when we were working with her on transitioning between different commands without giving her treats and could see the other dog owners around us with their dogs, how much more responsive she was being then the vast majority of them.

Last night was the biggest breakthrough yet, in my mind!&nbsp; We've been working on stay with Zoe and she seems to have that down pretty well as long as she can still see us and as long as she doesn't have to stay still for more than a minute or so.&nbsp; They want us to try 30 minute stays and I&nbsp;really have my doubts about ever mastering that one.&nbsp; 

But another trick they wanted us to try they called a &quot;ring of fire&quot;.&nbsp; They want you to get your dog to lay down, tell her to stay, then place treats just out of her reach in a circle around her, and all the while she's not supposed to move toward them. &nbsp;I know my greedy little dog pretty well and she is not the type to ignore treats in easy reach, especially when it's cheese, which is what we typically use in training exercises. &nbsp;However, much to my astonishment, Truong managed to teach her the exercise in a matter of 5 minutes last night.

I know she's just a dog, and I&nbsp;know it's not that big of a deal, but I&nbsp;was so proud to see her lying there staring at her daddy surrounded by cheese. &nbsp;She didn't even look at it, she just watched him entire time."

What date from 2008 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</strong><br />None.&nbsp; I started to put down dates that were significant but none of them will remain in my memory forever.<br /><br /><strong>8.

What was the best thing you bought?</strong><br />It's a toss up between my couches (that are super comfy and wonderful) and my new TV (which is huge).<br /><br /><strong>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</strong><br />My cousin Nina, who graduated from USC&nbsp;with her Masters degree, and my cousin Nicole, who got married.<br /><br /><strong>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</strong><br />No one really appalled me. &nbsp;I&nbsp;was a bit depressed over the way things fell out with Tyler though.&nbsp; We have been very good friends for most of the time we've known one another, and I&nbsp;did not expect things to turn out the way they did.<br /><br /><strong>14. Where did most of your money go?</strong><br />Plane tickets. &nbsp;I&nbsp;flew to California twice and Houston twice, and the second time (Christmas) the ticket cost almost as much as the other three flights combined.<br /><br /><strong>15.

Compared to this time last year, are you:</strong><br /><br />i. happier or sadder? Happier<br /><br />ii. thinner or fatter? Fatter- time to join a gym.<br /><br />iii. richer or poorer? Richer- having a job will do that for you.<br /><br /><strong>18.

What do you wish you&rsquo;d done less of?</strong><br />Crying- there were some times when one thing or another overwhelmed me and my natural stoicism seems to have deserted me. &nbsp;I've cried more in this year than the entire rest of my life it seems like.<br /><br /><strong>20. How will you be spending Christmas?</strong><br />Spent it in Houston with family and friends.<br /><br /><strong>22. Did you fall in love in 2008?</strong><br />No, I&nbsp;was already there and nothing has changed.<br /><br /><strong>23. How many one-night stands?</strong><br />None.<br /><br /><strong>24.

What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</strong><br />I had walking pneumonia at the time, so nothing.&nbsp; Actually, I think we made it out to dinner but I only ate about half my meal.&nbsp; I turned 29, it was depressing.<br /><br /><strong>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</strong><br />My friends living near by.<br /><br /><strong>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2008?</strong><br />Is it comfortable?&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>34. What kept you sane?</strong><br />Truong<br /><br /><strong>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</strong><br />No one stood out to me.<br /><br /><strong>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</strong><br />The election.<br /><br /><strong>37. Who did you miss?</strong><br />My friends, and sometimes my family too.<br /><br /><strong>38. Who was the best new person you met?</strong><br />My coworker Amanda.&nbsp; She makes work fun.<br /><br /><strong>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2008.</strong><br />I learned that you can't always fix things, even if you really want to, and sometimes it's just better for your sanity to let it go.<br /><br /><strong>40.

Last winter in Seattle (my first one!) the snow was like that.  Granted, it happened with more frequency than it ever did in Texas (it snowed 3 times I think, as opposed to once in a blue moon), but it still melted the next day.

I was just telling my family the other day how mild a winter we were having too.  Last year it was below freezing in November and it snowed December 1st.  Up until Saturday it hadn't even hit freezing yet.  Apparently I should have shut my mouth.

It's freezing today.  It was freezing yesterday.  It froze the day before that, and snowed.  The snow didn't melt.  Why didn't the snow melt?  Apparently it will be freezing tomorrow.  And the day after that.  And the day after that.  It's supposed to snow again on Wednesday and the weather could remain the same until after Christmas.  It's the coldest sustained weather it's been in Seattle since 1990.  I really hope this doesn't affect my flight out on Friday."

There was nothing of any real value inside the wallet, I don't even carry cash, but canceling all the cards etc is a huge inconvenience.  What is really making this situation horrifying is that I am supposed to be flying to California this weekend.

According to the airline, and I've called twice now in my paranoia, I just need to bring my social security card and birth certificate, both of which I <b>do</b> have, and everything will be fine.  I am anticipating having to jump through major security hoops.

What really sucks is that I had a Texas license still.  I've looked into trying to get a Washington license, or at least a WA ID card, but how do I prove I am who I say I am without the old TX license?  I've been trying to contact TX all day about this and have had ZERO luck getting through to a live person.

I am going to go down to the WA DPS office tomorrow to TRY and get a WA ID card, which should hold me over until I can get a new TX license and switch to a WA license, but I'm feeling quite pessimistic about that working out for me at the moment.

"event","I've been having Tyler related frustrations again.  They're actually pretty much ongoing but this is a specific irritant.  When we moved in we had a deal to share chores.  Tyler was going to cook meals, I was going to do dishes, and Truong was responsible for taking out trash.  

Tyler hasn't cooked a meal for anyone other than himself in probably 5 months now, which is fine really, because it forced me to learn to cook for myself and this is better.  However, he doesn't do anything now.  He doesn't take out the trash ever.  The few times our apartment has been tidied, dusted, vacuumed etc (including when <b>his</b> friend visited from out of town) Truong did it.  And in terms of dishes he barely does his own.  He leaves food in Tupperware in the refrigerator to rot and then when Truong and I clean it out once a month or so we end up throwing it away and washing those dishes ourselves.  Then last weekend he cooked a bunch of food for himself and left the dishes, saucepan, bowls, silverware and frying pan stacked up in the sink, not to mention several lids to pans lying around on the counters.  They sat there for over a week.

I guess you could say I could do them.  We washed the frying pan so we could use it and put a few of the items in the dishwasher when we ran it, but that still left a 2 qt. saucepan and several other items in the sink.  However, my stubborn side kicked in.  I'm rather sick of doing his dishes and picking up after him.  So this time I chose to put the dirty dishes on the floor of his bedroom.

I have no doubt started a fight but I think I'm pretty much past the point of caring.  Two months left on this lease and then no more selfish roommate."

Super comfy couches that you can sink into and nap on and we got them for a good deal thanks to the Labor Day sales going on.  

We don't actually have them yet, since there is no room in our current apartment we're having them delivered in two months when we move, but at least I know that we won't be sitting on the ground in our new place.

Next purchase, coffee table.  It's not so imperative that I get one right away, but I did see one I really liked.  It was metal legs and the top was tile.  I think I'd prefer it with a darker color, because they were light tannish tiles, but I decided I like that style, and Truong seems in agreement.

I am happy about this, because otherwise I might only get to see the OU and A&M games, since those are nationally televised.  However, in one of those ""it truly is a small world"" sort of moments I came to the realization that the guy who's in charge of the Puget Sound chapter is none other than my ex's college best friend.  At first I assumed it was a coincidence of two guys just having the same name, then I saw a picture and sure enough it was Chris.  Last I heard he was safely ensconced in Austin working for Dell.

I kind of wondered at first if he'd actually remember me, but it's not been <i>that</i> long and we were around one another a lot for about 4 solid years, so I'm thinking yes.  I think Truong was kind of weirded out by the idea of meeting him, but Chris was a nice guy (to me at least, I know Erin will argue).  Apparently I was thinking about that portion of my life a lot before I fell asleep last night because I dreamed about moving into that little house they all used to live in near the I35/183 interchange, only it was somehow magically in Seattle.

It looks like this weekend will have to be the quiet one I was hoping to make of Labor Day weekend, because Sat. August 30th is the first UT game and that Monday Truong is finally going to get to skydive (we hope).  After a month of Oregon, camping, the beach, and turbo shopping I need a break."

Amanda drove down Friday afternoon.  In the morning I had breakfast with my dad, took Samson to the groomers, and just generally enjoyed the gorgeous spring weather in Texas.  I got to put on sandals and a tank top for the first time in 5 months, and I very much revelled in it.

We had dinner at Chuy's, where I indulged in a margarita, queso, and many other yummy things I can't get in the Pacific Northwest.  Then we went to Valerie's house and played Settlers of Catan with Val and Jake.  That game rocks, I went out and got it for myself on Saturday.

Saturday was pretty uneventful, brunch at La Madeline's, lots of coffee and conversation.  I think Amanda and I got to say pretty much everything we needed to to one another; it should hold us over for a couple of months at least.

Sunday it was more mexican, Pappasitos that time.  My mom and I went out for coffee in the morning so we could chat.  She was busy at the rodeo all weekend so that was about the only time I got to see her.  It was a nice conversation, all told.  I think we came to an understanding, finally, about why I felt I needed to move and what I intend for my future, so that was a good thing.

What surprised me, though, was how much I missed Truong.  It felt weird to sleep alone.  I don't think I want to go back to visit anymore without him."

We're excited, we really like the floor plan.  It also comes with a washer and dryer already in the unit, which is most excellent in my opinion.  I gave notice at my job today.  My last day is Friday, October 26th.

I talked to my dad a bit more.  He knows I'm moving to Seattle, he just doesn't know when.  Now that I have the specifics, time to sit down and hash that one out with him.  When I told him I planned to move he didn't really react, but I imagine when I give him a date, and he realizes I'm entirely serious, he'll have something to say.

Three weeks to pack.  Ugh."

"event","Well I was very proactive and found about 5 or 6 apartments that looked promising for us to live in.  Truong said he'd go check them out for me, and let me know if they're inhabitable.  I've also sent my resume out to 6 or 7 places I found on Craigslist.  No responses yet.  I'm not letting this discourage me though, I have a month and a half still to look.

I finally got around to telling my mother what I planned to do.  She didn't react in quite the way I expected her to.  She isn't too pleased with what I've decided, but she didn't yell or try to forbid me to go (fat lot of good that does when talking to a 28 year old).  She did cry a bit, and told me she's worried about me and such, but she also said she understands why I feel like I have to do this.

She agreed that my father is going to blow a gasket.  She tried to warn me, as if I didn't already know.  Oh well, Sunday should be interesting, as that's the deadline I've set for myself."

"event","I think somewhere along the way in the last few weeks I've gone crazy.  My boyfriend asked me to move in with him a couple of weeks ago.  We've only been back together for 4 months now, and he lives in Seattle.  I told him I'd think about it.

Now I'm scoping out jobs and apartments and I'm moving by November 10th.  I haven't told my parents yet.  I probably should.  I guess I can blame Tyler for this anyhow; he's the one who informed me that I was moving and that he was coming with me.  It's far easier to do something crazy (like move half way across the country for a boy) when you're not doing it alone.

My boyfriend is happy.  Tyler is ecstatic.  I'm both, and scared.  I have never made a decision to do something this crazy before.  I've always rather liked to see the safety net before I jumped, if you know what I mean.  But I'm not getting any younger, so I better do any wild and crazy things and get them out of my system before I get so old it's ridiculous.  Or something.

My dad is going to fly off the handle when I tell him all this.  Part of me wants to do it now and get over it, and the other part wants to put it off to minimize the amount of time I have to listen to him."

"event","Both of the babies I expected this month are finally here.  Both of them quite late.  Valerie's son Jonah arrived on 8/11, 6 days late.  I haven't seen him yet, I haven't even gotten to speak to Val yet.  I got all the news from her brother and won't know anything more until she charges her cell and starts answering it again. I briefly considered dropping by, but new baby... I can wait.

Julie's daughter (she who was convinced the entire time that it was a boy), Grace Elizabeth, was born 8/19 at 1:19pm.  She was also 6 days late.  Poor Julie was in labor for over 12 hours and Grace was 8lbs. 8oz. 21 inches long.  I'm going over there next weekend to play with my ""niece"".  Well, as much as you can play with any newborn.  I was going to just drop in for the afternoon but Julie's husband told me to stay over night.  He said it will offer the perfect excuse for Julie to send her mother home.

It seems strange to me to look at the picture of Grace.  Julie and I have been friends for 23 years now.  We planned our weddings at the ripe old age of five, vowing to dress one another in pink and have perfect children when we were all grown up.  And now we are, and it's terrifying sometimes.  It was very strange to me to be in her wedding 6 years ago, and I imagine it will be stranger still to hold her child next Saturday.

I admit it makes me somewhat jealous.  I don't want to have a baby right now, but I do want one some day, and I always sort of imagined that our children would grow up together, as friends, like we were.  Now I feel a bit as if I'd been left behind."

"event","Last weekend I spent in Seattle with my boyfriend.  I have never really been to the Pacific Northwest, and I was surprised how absolutely beautiful it is, especially in light of the fact that Truong hates living there.  I didn't notice until I got home, but there were no mosquitoes!  I think I'd be sold in a heartbeat on any place that could offer me a safe haven from those blood sucking little bastards.

Saturday afternoon we visited the Snoqualmie Falls, which is a gorgeous waterfall about 30 min north of Seattle.  I have never seen a waterfall before, other than in pictures or on television.  I must admit I was fascinated.  We parked at the top of the cliff, looking down at the water.  Then we noticed people on the shore, so we went off in search of the path down.  All I have to say is, I was being remarkably dense that afternoon.  Even as I was congratulating myself on the forethought of wearing tennis shoes instead of sandals, because it would save my feet on the walk back up, I was not really considering said walk.  We made it down to the bottom, picked our way down to the shore, and sat on a rock in the sun for about an hour doing nothing.  And when I say ""picked"" I mean the shore was a bunch of broken rock and I was afraid of falling and twisting my ankle.  Then we decided we were ready to go back.  I thought I was going to die.  I don't think the repercussions of my decision to smoke have ever been so clear or so insistently demonstrated to me.  It didn't help that we forgot to bring water.  Safely at the top again I thought to ask how far down the shore was.  Half a mile.  At least I can say I did it right?  I nearly collapsed afterwards in exhaustion.

Sunday night he took me to dinner at the Space Needle.  That was very very cool.  Our reservation was late, 9:00 pm, so the sun was down completely and all the lights from the city were spread out before us.  The restaurant rotates too, a full rotation takes 47 minutes I think they said.  Half of that view is looking out over the river below.  I wish I'd had a camera with me.

We did some other things too, had dinner with Gene on Saturday night, went to see a few movies, but those were really the highlights of the trip.  I was surprised how chilly it was in Seattle.  I didn't take Truong seriously when he told me to bring a light jacket.  It was just too difficult to imagine I'd need anything other than a tank top when packing in the heat and humidity of a Houston summer.  I have a feeling when I go back to Seattle again this winter I'm going to be in trouble.  I don't think I own any real winter clothes."

"event","<lj-cut text=""So I don't ruin this for anyone..."">

It's taken me a couple days to write about this book.  I finished it at 8:30 am on Sunday morning and I spent the rest of the day numb.  I feel like I've lost someone I love.  Reading these books, watching those children grow up and learn and change... all I can really say is that I became incredibly emotionally attached to them, and now, knowing that I will never see them again, I am hurt.

I was incredibly bothered by Hedwig's death.  Especially in light of the fact that she was obviously upset with Harry, and I feel like when she died they were on bad terms, and that's not something you can go back and change.  I kept thinking that he should have let her go, to fly on her own to the Burrow, or wherever.

Mad-Eye I was proud of.  He died as I imagine he wanted, fighting Death Eaters.  I feel like he set himself up for that, or at least knew precisely the kind of danger he was getting himself into.  Far more than any of the others certainly.  The fact that his eye was in Umbridge's door... just no.  I wanted to see that bitch die.  I feel cheated that I didn't get to.

Ron I wanted to punch in the face.  Hard.  Multiple times.  But I really appreciated seeing the Riddle-Ron come out of the locket, talking about the disappointment of not being a girl, and the feeling of not living up to his family's or his own expectations.  I don't often stop to consider how extraordinary Ron is for being the youngest of 6 boys.  Bill was Head Boy, and smart, and <i>cool</i>.  And he had the advantage of being the oldest, of setting the standard instead of having to match it.  And Charlie was the athlete, Fred and George the comedians, Percy even had his own unique niche, even if it wasn't one Ron wished to emulate.  I wonder sometimes if I wouldn't have been even more resentful than he was, with his two best friends, the famous athelete and the smartest person their age.

I also wanted to hit Hermione at times, especially early on, for her close mindedness.  About a Horcrux being hidden at Hogwarts, about the reality of the Deathly Hallows...  I can't help but think that it has to be hard to be that skeptical when you're a witch, and impossible things occur around you daily.

I also kept thinking that there was great emphasis placed on trusting Harry's instincts, especially by Dumbledore, which were communicated to the others, but which no one seemed to do.

Lupin was one of the few things that rang really hollow for me.  The idea that he would leave his pregnant wife to follow Harry in to danger was something I didn't buy.  He seemed to me to be the person with the largest sense of responsibility, of all James' friends, which I believe he demonstrated admirably in PoA.  I just can't see his worry of having a werewolf child, and what it will do to his wife, pushing him that far out of character.

I absolutely loved the Dumbledore backstory, and the doubts that Harry experiences.  I have always appreciated the fact that the heroes of these books are not ""good"" in the lily white sense.  Harry breaks rules, he gets mad, he lashes out, Ron is even worse, and even Hermione has her moments.  I remember in OotP when she led Umbridge into the woods thinking, ""she's going to get her killed.""  Maybe that wasn't her true intention, but she's a smart girl, she'd seen the centaurs earlier, knew their feelings, their degree of anger towards wizards, knew Umbridge enough to know she wouldn't be able to handle them tactfully, so I have to think subconciously she didn't care.  So that left Dumbledore in somewhat the position of the ""good"" guy, the one that everyone always believes in, who never seems to do anything wrong.  And then you have Voldemort on the other side of the coin, the ultimate evil.  But she humanized Dumbledore, and in a way I think she humanized Voldemort too.  When Harry walks into the forest at the end, imagining he's going to face his death, he refers to himself as the abandoned boy, and lumps himself into that category with Voldemort and Snape.  Certainly he knew then that Snape was not the evil betraying murderer he'd imagined him, but he had no illusions to the opposite about Voldemort, and yet I think seeing them as sharing something made him more than just someone to be destroyed, even to Harry.

I wanted Snape to die a heroic death (I have never believed he would survive this book).  It wasn't what I hoped it would be, but it was enough.  Him asking Harry to look at him, wanting to die looking into Lily's eyes, broke my heart.  I cried through the entire chapter of Snape's memories.

I expected Lucius to die, and I hoped to see Draco do something redeeming.  I was very surprised, and gratified, by Narcissa.  She has always been very interesting to me as a character, even though we see her so seldomly, and I feel like I read her, even as far back as GoF.

I wish Neville could have been the one to kill Bellatrix.  Or at the very least his grandmother.  I was gratified that he got his moment to shine, and pleased to see Mrs. Weasley as something other than ""mum"", but I felt like Neville had the most right to that.

I am a bit skeptical about the whole wand thing.  If merely disarming someone is enough to make a wand switch allegiance then it seems to me no one would have their original wand anymore.  Certainly Lupin and Snape both have a claim on Harry's.

It was disconcerting to watch Harry stripped of everything comforting to him in this book.  He can't return to Hogwarts, he has to avoid his friends, he loses his owl, his wand breaks, Ron leaves.  I kept remembering what Dumbledore said to him at the end of OotP, about not telling him about the prophecy sooner because he wanted to let him stay happy a bit longer, and of not making him a prefect because he had enough on his plate already.  And also Harry's determination at the end of HBP not to allow anyone else to stand between him and Voldemort, and I can only marvel that someone put through so much could still remain that kind.  I know if I was him, having been through all that, I wouldn't have been so sanguine about marching off to die for everyone in the end.

There are so many more things I think and feel about these books, but everything is so muddled at the moment, I feel like I need to go back and reread the whole thing to make sure it all sank in. </lj-cut>"

"event","Krista finally spoke to Bob at about four this morning.  He called her from Germany, where he underwent more surgery.  She says he sounded okay, but in a lot of pain.  He'll be back in the US sometime later this week.  He's not coming to Texas after all; they're sending him straight to Fort Carson, Colorado.  Krista and his mother are just waiting for a definite date for his return to buy their plane tickets.

Of the five people in the truck with Bob three of them survived.  The two guys on the back, and Bob, who was in the middle gun turret.  The driver, Bob's friend Elias, was killed, as was whichever high ranking military person they were transporting.  Bob told Krista that Elias was alive when they got him back to the hospital, but that he wouldn't have wanted to live like that and he doubts Elias would have either.  He wouldn't say any more about it.  I just keep thinking of the man's poor wife, finding out the day before Christmas that her husband is dead; and a small part of me is thanking God that at least my sister isn't going through the same thing right now.

Bob had to have multiple surgeries to remove the sharpnel from the left side of his body, as well as to fix his leg.  Apparently it'll be awhile before he'll be able to walk again.  He said he thinks the tattoo on his calf is screwed up, which Krista said he sounded vastly annoyed about.  He also told her he'll likely have a harelip for awhile from where his gun hit him in the face.  Apparently they pulled one of the truck's bolts out of his thigh and he kept it in a jar for Krista.  She told him he really shouldn't have.  I think it's his way of finding humor in all of this."

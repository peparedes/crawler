"event","hm.... do you ever get teh feeling tha people arent really your friends? that they pretend to be just becasue you are really nice and basically let people take advantage of you? sometimes i do......... i know a few of my frinds are my REAL friends. but some of the others i get teh feeling only are because 1)htey like me in a sexual way 2)they want to use me 3)they feel it is their obligation becuase we have a lot of mutual friends 4)because they think they can get into my pants[ha] or 5)because they want to get with one of my friends. 
i hope this isnt so. i dont realy think i am all that bad of a person. i do have faults, all people do. but i think that basically i am an ok person. im just super shy so i dont make freinds as easily as some people. also, i have a tendency to be really nice and trusting to people. no matter who they are. and i also dont mind ""lending"" people money. which i have realized that you shouldnt if you dont really know the person. i haven had a bad expericence recently but i was thinking about it and it is kinda stupid. ho-hum."

Your lack of ""traditional"" gay pride is interpreted by many queers as internal homophobia, but in truth you just want to be your true self. Not just gay.

and, to end teh crazyness of the night, i fnally talked to david. he apologized for hurting me and we tlaked for over an hour aobut everythign. about our friend ship and how we dont work as more and about how he has changed. it made me  so sad. i just wante do hug him  and tel him that it woudl be ok, that eveythign  would end up fine, taht i didn hate him and never could. it is just impossible. what is sad though, is that i still have feelings. maybe they will go away when we FINALLY see each other and everything. like, i looked at a pic i have in my room from valentines day and i almost started to cry. not from me wanting him, but because it was almost gone. becuase i had thought i lost him forever and i was so sad for that. I MISS DAVID!

6th grade
we meet, fall in love and pledge to never be apart. we chill with our teacher, and make fun of me for my one exploit into boyfriendland {yucky kenny]. we end teh year ina movie . austin powers to the first power

7th grade
we ""magicaly"" get clases to gether. we obessess over teh same guys[although now they are strangly uncute to us]. rinna dances teh class away in pe and our obessession iwth the beatles begins to really take hold of our meager lives. we end this  year in yet anothe rmovie, austin powers to the second power

9th grade
we start the year of ""beleiving"" tha we will meet many new people and actually be challenged in our work. we discoverwe were wrong, not only is it mac all over agian, but we both get mrs. poer and rinna gets into the retarded block class. we meet david, molly, and paul. all of which has their own little story

10th grade
we split up. we only get one day of one anoter before ""the man"" breaks us apart. but, our friendship is to much for""the man"". we retain it and it grows. although we dont see each other much, its still there. just chiling iwth all of its ""when toys attack"" nonsense and boufriend madness.

we have been through so much!!!!!! hah. some of the stuffis just too much. remember that night with christi? and the gross bugs? when we threw water balloons at you when you were sleeping? haha. all those times? or when we signed EVERY PAGE of one anothers year books. or when we were obsessed with the pokemon gameboy game? and played the card version iwth your little bro? or when little makhi thought his belly button was an apple? or when we accidentaly stole teh outfit from jc penny for his pics? haha

"event","well...i am tired. and i have tomorrow off.meaing i coudl stay up all through the night, doing what ever i felt like [ya right] and wake up when ever i wanted to. but, im not going to. for one, because my little puppeis have jus awoken i have the feeling that i am going to have to be taking care of them soon and becuasei dont feel like it. i just want to sleep. that, and for some reason i feel like writting. but, so far all ihave written has just been what ever happens to be floating around in my head at that moment. hm...its much easier to type it than write it. forone, because its much more legiable. usually, if i were to write this down, i wouldnt even be able toread it. secondly, because its easier on the hands. writting a lot makes my hands cramp up and get all uncomfortable. yuck yuck


well, now i am going to write about waht i did um...i think last night. that would be firday, right? anyways, on whatever night that was, paul came and picked me and melissa up cuz we three were going to go bowlign. so, there we were, on our way when he gets teh great idea to get molly and jeff. well, really only jeff but where ever he goes so does she. anyways, so we go out to riverside and its all full so we drive all the way from camas to battleground to go to this place called tiger bowl. omg. i have never seen a cooler, more white trash bowling place before in my life. it was about eh size of like 2 or 3 minit marts together and it only hadl ike 8 lanes. but, it had the most awesome vidieo games. it had this one taht was like 10 different ones in one. on it was the original mario bros and duck hunt. duck hunt?! i havnet played that since iwaslike 7! it was almst orgasmic. then, there was another video game there taht was pac man! yes yesyesyeysyes. and they had a bunch of pin ball machines. my god. that place is a must for everyone. it was so great. and, when we went at least, there were some little 7th grade hoes there. so, if any of you fellas out there are inneed of some head, and were not talking about the bathroom, we all know where your headed. tiger bowl. gimme a white, gimmie a trash, whats taht spell? TIGER BOWL!"

Goddamn you half-Japanese girls
Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello, baby

But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me
I'm the epitome of Public Enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me

I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

I asked you to go to the Green Day concert
You said you never heard of them
How cool is that??
So I went to your room and read your diary:

""Watching Grunge leg-drop New-Jack trough presstable...""
And then my heart stopped:
""listening to Cio-Cio San fall in love all over again.""

I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

How stupid is it? I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
How stupid is it? won't you gimme a minute
Just come up to me and say ""hello"" to my heart
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say: ""I'm falling for you""

I wish I could get my head out of the sand
'Cause I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean

But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes Without shakin', and I ain't fakin'
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon

I'm a lot like you so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me"

You are seeking an affectionate relationship, offering fulfilment and happiness. You are capable of powerful emotional enthusiasm. Deep down, you are a kind loving person, always helpful and willing to adapt yourself if necessary to realise the bond of affection that you desire. But you need the same consideration and understanding from others...and it is this need that sometimes will hold you back ... so let go - trust and you may pleasantly surprised at what happens ... 

Being impulsive and irritable, your desires and needs are paramount. You do things with insufficient thought - with little regard to the consequences that may follow. As a consequence of this attitude, you may be experiencing stress and conflict.

Conditions are rather confusing at this time. You would like to involved with a particular person or a particular situation..... butyou are holding back. You find it difficult to make a decision...

You are trying to prove yourself .. not only to yourself.. but also to everyone around you...There is much that you would like to say and do .. but the situation warrants self-restraint .. and that is the last thing that you have on your mind..It would seem that you have an unsatisfied need to ally yourself with others whose standards are as high as your own. You want to be different - to stand out from the crowd. This is subjecting you to considerable stress but you tend to stick to your attitudes despite lack of appreciation. Of course, you are finding the situation uncomfortable and would like nothing better but to break away from it. But you don't like the idea of compromise. Your main problem is that you are unable to resolve the situation because you continually postpone making the necessary decisions ... You feel that if you make the wrong choice this would lead to such opposition that you would not be able to command the esteem of others. It is essential that those around you are prepared to comply with your wishes and respect your opinions. Only when this compliance is established, will you feel at ease and secure. 

You would like to be respected and valued for yourself and this can only be achieved from a close and harmonious relationship.

"event","Well I'm finaly back in the U.S. I got back home on Monday the 7th. My trip to Spain was awsome though. Alot of stuff went wrong of course. First, I missed my flight going there because we got on a 3 or 4 hour detour off of I-20. Later I found out there was a chimical explosion and the cloud was covering the interstate. My first day in Spain I got realy sick. I couldnt see strait, stand up, or talk. It sucked. But I got better and did ALOT of sight seeing. I mainly just went to historical places and art museiums. Most of the places we really wanted to go though were under reconstruction. Of course they wait till I decide to visit to start all of that. I got to see Christopher Columbus' grave though, so that was kool. I tried a ton of new foods and almost tried a chicken heart but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I took 9 rolls of film that I need to go pick up today. I'm sure I got a couple of good pictures atleast. The day after I got back, I had a band meeting about the show we want to put on for this manager. We got an awsome deal from the Imperial Theatre and a sound guy named Trey, who has worked with us many times before. The only thing is that if we don't get at least 200 people to come, it's going to look like no one came. We aren't charging anything to get in so hopefully that will get more people in there. It's going to be on Saturday, July 24th. Doors open at 7pm. There are alot of details we have to work out. This week we are going to try to get some sponsors to help us pay for all of this. We want to try to get a compercial on regular air time on 95 rock but I'm sure that will be really expensive. I got the sample contract from the manager also. It looks pretty good with a couple of changes that I would make. The contract says that we have to sign with her for 5 years though. But on the upside, it promises to have us signed to a major record label with in the first 2 years. Dallas left for Canada or something and wont be back for a couple of weeks but me, keith, and Chris are still going to try to practice and make sure the music and the show is perfect. We have to play 2 sets that will last about an hour a piece and there will be an intermission. I hope we can get people to come. It has been a really long time sense we played our last show. Maybe a month or so. Anyway, mark that date on your calander and bring everyone you know. I'm out.

#5. Nothing is as good as it seems. Read between the lines and find out what's really going on."

"event","In about 20 mins, I'll be headed out the door to the Atlanta Air Port to hop on a plane and fly across the world to Madrid, Spain. I'm alittle nervous because my parents arn't comming with me and the other person I am going with has never flown before. I'm also nervous about all the terroristic activities that have been going on in Madrid lately. But I figure, if its my time to go, then it's my time to go. I have only been out of the country once before in my life and that was on a cruise with my parents going to the Bahamahs. This year I've gotten to go all over the place. Las Vegas, New York, Spain. Maybe even a trip to Las Angeles at the end of the summer. Speaking of which, the LA manager is comming to hear us play on July 23rd. I hope we can pull everything together and I hope that if we all don't agree to work with her, it won't cause the band to break up. I'm sure it won't though. Well, I'm out.

"event","I think today was my bands last practice for a long time. So much is going on thats not letting us practice and we really need to. Here's whats goin on...Tommarrow I have to go to school for my last exam and I'm going to the movies with my gf and keith and this girl that hes talking to. Friday, me, Dallas, and Chris have graduation practice and Chris has to work again. There is a chance that we can practice Friday though. Saturday is graduation and we all graduate at different times and Chris is leaving to go out of town. Chris gets back the day that I leave for my senior trip. Me and my gf are leaving for Spain for almost 2 weeks. Im very excited. The day I get back, Dallas leaves to go out of town for a looong time. He comes back sometime in July and we get a week to practice before our show. We have to make this show really good because the manager from LA is comming to watch. She sounds like she has alot of good contacts and can help us out alot. Hopefully things will work out and we can strike a good deal with her and then hopefully soon, get signed. If we can get signed before I have to start school in the fall, then things will be great. I only want to play music, although I know I have to have a fallback plan. Thats why I'm going to go to school for Graphic Design. We had practice today though. We worked on transitions and some new songs. We are getting ready for a 2 hour set. I hope we can pull things together in July. 

#3. If you want it bad enough you can get it. Although, you may have to work your butt off. Lifes not easy."

"event","Well, today was my last full day of high school. They made the anouncement today that seniors didn't have to come to school tommarrow if they were exempting both exams and sinse that is what I am doing, I don't have to come. I sat in 6th period thinking about all of my friends that I will never see again. I even wrote a song about it, but I wont share that with you just yet. It was a bitter-sweet feeling thinking about how great it is to finaly be graduating but at the same time thinking, ""Did I do everything I wanted to do? Did I make the most out of my high school experience? Is anyone going to remember me next year? What about all of my friends that are going off to college around the nation?"". Just stupid stuff like that. I graduate Saturday though so I'm very excited about that. I've also gotten word of an LA manager wanting to come and watch my band sometime this summer. I don't have many details yet so I'll have to write about that latter on. Once again I shall leave you with a piece of advice.

"event","Well this is my first journal entry. I'm new to this whole thing but hey, every bodies doin' it! Most of my entries are probly going to be about my band so I'll give alittle bit of background info.

My band is made up of Keith(lead guitar), Chris(bass), Dallas(vocals), and me(drums). We are all about to graduate high school on May 22nd. The band is fairly young, only about 1 1/2 years old. We play alternative rock music. At least, that's what we have been labeled as. We take our music very seriously. Because we take this so seriously, we spend alot of time together and like in any relationship we have our problems. Usualy it's only one person at a time causing the problem. We are very lucky though and have really been working hard on sorting out all of our differences. We have some big oprotunities comming up for us so this weekend we had a band meeting to make sure everyone was still on the same page. The meeting went well and everyone seems to have basicly the same plan. Some compromising will need to take place on everyones part to make things work but I'm sure we can do it. 

That's all I'm going to wright for now. There's still alot I have to write about though. BUT I shall leave you with a bit of advice...

#1. Don't hide anything. Let everyone know how it is up front. Some feeling may get hurt but it's better for everyone in the long run."

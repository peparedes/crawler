"event","It's updating time...working again thank god...Tony and I are no longer together. He said he never wanted a relationship in the first place. It hurts, and I'm being as strong as I can, but on the inside, I'm crumbling.  Not just because of Tony either, im not sure why. each day...i wake up and i tell myself that i have to make it though, but everyday it's harder and harder. I'm tired of being hurt, not just by ""men"", by family, by friends, by ""the ones i hold dear"". Can't take it much longer. As much as i hate it, i'm starting to realize what it's like to be emotionally numb/void. which ever you choose is fine - they both apply. this is more than i bargained for, this whole lack of emotion thing. it's quite decieving you know, you really don't so much have a lack of emotion, it's more of an abundance of hatred. I'm becoming cold and inpenitrable. But it's when I don't want to feel at all that I feel the most."

"event","TONIGHT:
   Went to sleep after I ate but Nessie called to talk with me at about ten o'clock or so. We talked about her and Chris and how McAuthor is trying to hit it but it's not going to happen and then she mentioned how pissed of Antonio got when Mike told him what he said and blahdy blahdy blah. But it made me realize how much I really like this boy when I got as upset as I got last night and how happy it made me when I found out it didn't really happen. Either way, while talking to Nessie she made the comment that she was so hungry. I know they don't have any food in their house, they don't really have that much money, so I offered to bring her some food seeing as how we had a shit load of left overs. I called Antonio to see if he would come with me because I didn't want to be in that house with Justin...cuuuuz he's a pompas asshole. So he said yeah. We went to Nessie's...she rolled a joint I DID NOT SMOKE. ^_^ yay to me I's proud. Then Antonio and I went to Rick's and just chated for a while. He's really growin on me ya know. :P good night everyone. oh my how I love the ""artistic mouse""for my mood."

"event","There comes a time when an assement of one's life is needed...good or bad.  For some odd reason the random events of tonight has put light on this subject. It started off when I had to go and pick Nessie up from work. I knew something was going down, wasn't sure what it was, but I knew SOMETHING. The plan was for me to pick up Nessie, go get Tony, pick up a few beers, and just - chill/relax- at Nessie's house. Well, I pick her up, called Antonio because we were right up the street didn't see the need in bringing her home and then coming all the way back to pick him up. He didn't answer so we figured he was getting ready. We went to her brother's house so that she could get some clothes and also because it was just a block away from Antonio's. She changed did all that good shit and calls Antonio, Mike answered and said he was busy. Well about fourty five minutes later we called back and I hear Nessie's side of the conversation. 
""Where's Antonio? He's what?! Well let him know that we are leaving and he's not included anymore."" So I asked her what was going on...but I knew. We get in the car and she lets me know that he's fucking one of kelly's friends who's like 16 or something. I cannot lie, it hurt. But I was just going to brush my shoulders off. So I'm bringing her home, we were still going to chill even though I was feeling down and I'm driving on West Esplanade and a cop pulls me over. He didn't give me a ticket but he said I cannot drive my car anymore until I get it fixed. Well guess what - that's not going to happen. I do not have two thousand dollars. So I'm bringing Nessie home and we get to the apparment. Justin was home. *sigh* Her roomate is an asshole and I cannot stand him. Not just because of his rudeness towards me, but towards Nessie. Well...as usual he's cold towards us and doesn't say anything. He comes upstairs because he has to talk with her about the situation...he doesn't like people over there. Well, I had had a pretty shitty night and I just exploded on him. Granted he didn't deserve everything I said to him, it sure as hell felt good. Regardless, I had had it. I left and went home. I started drawing like I always do when I'm upset...didn't come out to shabby I might add...either way, it got me thinking. I'm not sure how it did, but it did. I'm very disapointed in myself. I could be doing so much better right now, and I'm not. No, not all of it is my fault, but I've made some pretty shitty disicions in my lifetime. I got to thinking about so much shit. I through the rest of my weed down the toilet too. I said I was quiting when really I was just ""slowing"" down. Well, I've decided from now on there is no middle ground for me. I will not settle for anything anymore. I will try my hardest instead of doing the least I have to do. I'm tired of being the fuck up in my group of friends, this isn't going to cut it anymore. I have a lot of plans, I'm not sure how I will go about fulfilling these plans, but I will. I know I can. I have a headache right now...it's seven in the morning, well quarter to and I have no been to bed. I cannot sleep, but maybe with this I will be able to. I feel like sucluding myself for a little while...so my friends...I love you, but I need time. Do not think I'm ignoring you if I do not call, there are just a few things that I need to do."

"event","I think there is something wrong with me. I have this urge to travel. i always get this way but some times i cannot ignore it. this horrible urge to pack a bag and just go and see where it will take me. not far im sure but who knows ya know. so i talk to mike about it, hoping ...i dont know what i was hoping. and the response i get is ""just dont go"" and then something or other about the game he's playing...i do believe it went like this:
pie [2:31 A.M.]:  *random thought* i want to go somewhere
pie [2:31 A.M.]:  i want to like..travel somewhere
mike [2:31 A.M.]:  i cant help you with that one anytime soon
mike [2:31 A.M.]:  lol
mike [2:32 A.M.]:  this dragon is a bastard
pie [2:32 A.M.]:   no i hate this feeling though
mike [2:33 A.M.]:  well just dont leave
mike [2:33 A.M.]:  thats all
mike [2:33 A.M.]:  im gonna have to cheat the system and steal me some potions
pie [2:34 A.M.]:  you steal you some potions

I'm not exactly sure what it was that I was expecting. It's not his fault, he didn't do anything...wrong. I just ...UGH this is some faggoty ass shit I do tell you that much. Why am I so restless? Where did it come from ya know that's what I want to know. I get so jealous of people who can do what they want and go where they want. Joe for example...don't really talk with him anymore, just have nothing to say. But I ALWAYS read his journals, I get excited to read about where it is he's going next. It must be so great. Or my friend Simon who lives in Aussie...He's nineteen and travels all around the world. He's not made of money or anything, but he still does it. Why can't I be like that? Is something holding me back or is it not right to move around like that in the first place? I just wish this urge would go away. I do not sleep, I sit up all hours of the night. My mind wanders...I wander. But nothing ever happens."

One being, ""God I'm ready for college"" and the other one is just...*sigh* how I've hurt people in my past. I've changed, I know I changed, but they do not know this...nor do they probably care. They don't know the Pie now is different from the Pie then. I wish I could just go back and right all of my wrongs. There is one main one that is bothering me the most. Kevin...you all know who he is, my ex boyfriend who I fucked over and made a bad mistake. Bria, you know who he is...I'm sure you recall many a nights when I told you I was thinking about him. Or that night you picked up the paper off your living room floor and I jumped up so quick lol really did look like i had something to hide...but that was a letter to him. I do not know how to go about saying I'm sorry. How to go about proving to them that they can trust me now, and that I want them to so badly. So...here I go. I'm going to admit my mistake to whomever wants to read it. no lies, no sugarcoating. kevin and I were going out...i stopped calling, i stopped seeing him...without a goodbye without anything. sounds harsh huh? well it was. why i did this...wow. im not quite sure. why i thought i did it was different from why i did it if that makes sense. i convinced myself that i wanted to die..when i didn't. and so i felt like shit. yall all know how i was at that point in my life. and so i just rejected the world. sounds like a crap load of shit im sure...well im sorry if it does, but that was me, humiliating myself to a lot of people. im not even sure some ofmy friends knew how that whole kevin and LeeAnn thing went down. now they know. i was a bitch about the whole thing and i am TRUELY sorry and i can only hope you will forgive me. going onto the other thing. god im ready for college. *does a dance* soon my lovelies....soon. woohooo. need to get my car fixed the mother fucker is gettin more ghetto by the day. the damned stankin lankin. :P ta ta for now everyone. i love you all! raaawr"

i do it for the joy it brings
because i am a joyful girl
because the world owes me nothing
we owe each other the world.
i do it cuase its the least i can do
because i learned it from you.
i do it just because i want to,
because i want to.
everything i do i judged,
and they mostly get it wrong
but oh well
the bathroom mirror has not budged,
and the woman who lives there can tell
the truth from the stuff they say.
she looks me in the eye,
and says would you prefer the easy way?
no, well ok then,
don't cry.
heyy...heyy. yeah, yeah
and i wonder if everything i do
i do instead
of something i would rather do more
the question fills my head.
and i know there is no grand plan here
this is just the way it goes.
i do it for the joy it brings
because i am a joyful girl


this song oddly reminds me of myself and i love it and im not sure why. odd but i do love it so DOWNLOAD IT it's totally not my style so i don't get why i like it. but i do love it"

Jessica: I'm sorry I was not there for you when you needed me. I didn't know I was going to leave as soon as was. *sigh* I don't know how to put this in words...this is why I haven't apologized yet. You're one of my best friends...you've been there for me when other people weren't growing up, and the one time you needed me, i wasn't there. i feel like i owe you more than an apology and i don't know what to say...except that i fucked up and i love you more than you will know. and i hope that you can forgive me. i love you

Katie: we've made our truce, but regardless, im still very sorry about how i over reacted. i love you yo!

rob: i fucked up and he's upset...i understand. but I'm very sorry about the whole situation. you have no idea how much i just want to see you and start a friendship back up. i've said what i need to say to you, yet you won't listen to me. i can only keep trying

"event","Life is harder then they wanted us to know, I'm sure of it. Finish High School, go to college, be something they said. What they didn't tell you is that there would be things thrown at you, they never told us about the ""go back three spaces"" card. If they had, what would our motivation be, right? Yes, I'm well aware of the fact that there are people out there eating rice off the curb in the back of some suppa asain buffet out there, and that I shouldn't bitch about the simplicity of my life in the big scheme of things. but daaaamn! who the fuck had it out for me when they signed the release form for LeeAnn to come into this world. They were like, ""how about we put all the good cards on the bottom and make her work for it"" yeah bitch, i done rolled the dice one too many times...i want a do-over! I'm confused and need some insight on my life...call me lame for resorting to some lame online journal to ask the general public for information, but maybe they know something I don't know. Let me lay it all out on the line for you people who don't know why it is I have no direction in my life and need signs to know where to go.

    I left for Georgia on December 28th 2004, it is now March 11, 5:27 in the morning, and I am sleeping at a friends house, on her sofa, because I can't sleep where I live because my ex lives there. My ""home"". I left New Orleans for a number of reasons. One, my brother was released from prison in August of 2004. For anyone who doesn't know I hate my brother, and for those of you who do know...know it's a well earned hatred. If you do not know, just know that it's well passed sybling rivalry. I couldn't stand the site of him. I would wake up late just so he'd be off to work for the day. I would leave the house when he got home so i wouldn't have to deal with him. Two, my mother...as much as I love her, would hurt my feelings...yeah that's pussy what of it. The little things. I would bust my ass. I cleaned the house all the time and cooked. I paid rent...yet she never appreciated these things, or at least she didn't let me know. It was only noticed when i didn't do something RIGHT. RIGHT = her way and no other way. I want to go to college, and she would love it if i did, but remember, I'm just a failure, so it's not so easy. I thought maybe if I started anew that things would be different. So I moved to Moultrie fuckin Georgia. What happens? I cannot find a job because apparently I do not fit a certain social acceptance that I should. So, I go running back to Mommy and asking if I can come back home. Like a good Mother she sends me the money to come back home. So then I'm home...one week later I'm wanting to leave again. I actually cannot put my finger on exaclty why I wanted to leave. As much as it sucked, I got a taste of the REAL world and what it was like to be on your own. What I had wasn't much, but it was mine, and that's more than I could ever say about anything when I lived with my mother. So I move back to GA, hook up with my roommate, everything is dandy. Then  we break up, and things start to go to shit. I live with him...which is hard so I sleep on Bria's sofa...next door neighboor/friend. That doesn't help anyone's confidence. I STILL cannot find a job and I won't be able to go to college for another year if I decide to stay here. There is a job that I have a good chance of getting, yet I still want to come home. But then again I don't. I want to make it on my own, but I want my loved ones there with me. To cheer me on i suppose, I don't know. But why is it so hard to make it on my own back home. Is it because I have my mother to fall back on? Is it because it's so much easier living with my mother than trying? Am I just lazy. Where is the motivation? I don't understand things...I have a splitting head ache. What should I do? Should I stay here and TRY or go back home and TRY. or should i go back home and do what i have to do...not try. become determined and do what the fuck i have to do. because im 18 years old...soon to be 19, this living at home with my mother shit isn't going to cut it. Maybe I'm just too impatient. What should I do...someone, anyone? help me."

"event","ok, pie isn't a how to book so this isn't gonna work. i've tried to devoid my life of drama, and it only becomes worse. worse i tell you WORSE.
Good news:
*coming home as soon as my income taxes come back
*katie and i settled stupidness that never should have happened
*going to college as soon as i get back home

...that should be enough good news to last me a while

BAD, EVIL, NONINCOURAGING NEWS (in order of importance)
*until i get my income taxes im pretty much stranded with no place to live
*i want to make things better with Rob...but he won't really speak with me. don't blame him, but im trying.
*can't find job in moultrie cuz they think im a freak
*my mother doesn't know im coming home and i hope she wont be upset.
*situation with ex is a little awkward

...hmmm that actually puts things into perspective. It's not all quite as bad once you put them down infront of you. i would still like them to be handled...but not quite so bad. but where would the interesting things happen if there were no drama. other than that i am content. im sittin here drinking a beer, smoking my cig, and listening to still by brian mcknight. i find myself wondering how people who don't know me and put my thoughts into a song better than i can into a conversation with myself in my head. music r god and i heart you so. and this might sound like bull shit and i dont care who see it. but i miss rob. i loved rob, i still do. hope we can be friends and settle things. i also miss everyone else. and this is why i must come home. yall are all my home without you i am lost. and call me lame for quoting one of the age old quotes...but you don't know what you ahve until it's not there anymore. and with that...i will go and dance to some good ol bob marley and let me remind you people i haven't smoked weed in like..too long!!! lol i love you all

""still"" by brian mcknight
Funny when you stop and think 
times goes faster then you blink 
nothings ever like it was 
but girl we've got a special thing 
all the happiness it brings 
is more than enough 

I know its hard to believe 
your still the biggest part of me 
all I'm living for 
I still think about you 
I still dream about you 
I still want you 
and need you by my side 
I'm still mad about you 
all I ever wanted was you 
your still the one (2x) 

It's hard to breathe when were apart 
your like sunshine in my heart 
I keep you here inside 
you've been everything to me 
you've been and always will be 
the apple of my eye 

And I know its hard to believe 
your still the biggest part of me 
all I'm living for 
I still think about you 
I still dream about you 
I still want you 
and need you by my side 
I still mad about you 
all i ever wanted was you 
your still the one (2x) 

If you love me 
look into my eyes and say you do 
I've been waiting all my life 
for someone just like you 
baby all that we've been through 
girl im still in love with you 
and I want you to know I do, I do 

I still think about you 
I still dream about you 
I still want you 
and need you by my side 
I'm still mad about you 
all I ever wanted was you 
your still the one (2x)"

"event","ok so considering that last update...this should be interesting. i no longer live in new orleans, i now live in moultrie ga...DIFFERENT. marc...i love you to death but i hate you so bad. we got into a fight two nights ago because i had entirely too many shots of tequila.annnnd...i wound up in the hospital for trying to kill myself last week...stupid yes i know. so i called marc, cuz he's one of the only ones that can help..he didn't. we haven't really been talking. well i get out and go to talk to him, he got engaged to renee while i was in the hospital. should be interesting considering he asked her when he was drunk. fucked up, i've been there for him for three years and he's gonna do me like he has. so...tequila night...i had something to say about it and we got into a fight. not an arguement...a FIGHT. obviously we're not friends anymore. then the night after that *last night* my boyfriend and i broke up. not only did we break up but before we did he called my friend to tell her that he was breaking up with me. lovely eh? so i walk in my neighboors house cuz i knew he would be there and i say ""how many people were you planning on telling before you broke up with me"" his face was like O_O and he says ""we have to talk"" so we're broken up or whatever. but let me remind you of how awkward this is. I LIVE WITH HIM. well im sleeping on my friends couch...his neighboor. this too is awkward considering he left me for her. so im taking it all in strides. a friend of mine just pissed me off because she said ""i dont love you anymore"" because i posted an entry about a friend of mine on myspace when i moved about how much i love her and that i would miss her. I DO LOVE HER AND I DO MISS HER. so...what! she's my best friend what the fuck do you expect me to say...*sigh* childish indeed. but because she IS my friend i still love her, regardless of how she feels of me. when you love someone you just don't care. even though it did piss me off QUITE a bit. so now im sittin here at bria's house..it's a little after five in the morning and i can't sleep. why? i dont know. haven't been doing much of that lately. but on a brighter note...my mother sent me a kick ass package today!!! i heart my mom and i heart katie. cuz she doesn't care who my friends are!!!! well that's not the only reason. ^_^"

Possum come a-knockin'
by nancy van laan

Possum come a-knockin' at the door, at the door.  Possum come a-knockin' at the door.

Granny was a-sittin' and a-rockin' and a-knittin' when a possum come a-knockin' at the door.


Ma was busy cookin' in the kitchen makin' taters when a possum come a-knockin' at the door.


Pa was busy fixin' and a-bangin' and a poundin' when a possum come a-knockin' at the door.


Pappy was a-whittlin', makin' play toys for the baby, when a possum come a-knockin' at the door.

Sis was tossin' baby while pappy was a-whittlin' when a possum come a-knockin' at the door.

Brother was untanglin' all the twiny line for fishin' while sis was tossin' baby and pappy was a-whittlin' and pa as busy fixin' and ma was busy cookin' and granny was a-knittin' when a possum come a-knockin' at the door.


Coon-dawg was a-twitching' and a-scratchin' in the corner when a possum come a-knockin' at the door.


Tom-cat started sniifin' and a-spittin' and a-hissin' when a possum come a-knockin' at the door.

""what's that?"" sis said.
""dont know,"" brother said.
""what's that?"" pa said.
""don't know,"" granny said.
""but that cat!"" she said.
""that cat oughter go!""


Then dawg started sniffin' nd a-pawin' and a-growlin' while the cat, tail a-twitchin', was a-hissin' and a-howlin',
makin' granny stop a-knittin' and pappy stop a-whittlin' and baby start a -fussin', sis and brother start a-cussin', 'cause a li'l ol' possum was a-knockin' at the door.


""what's that?"" granny said.
""dont know,"" pappy said.
""what's that?"" ma said.
""don't know,"" pa said.
then i creepy-crossed the floor and peeked under the door.
""it's a possum come a-knockin on the door!"" i said. ""it's a possum come a-knockin' on the door!""


then brother cam a-leapin and sis came a-runnin' and baby came a-crawln' and dawg started howlin' and pappy was a chucklin' and granny's eyes was twinklin' as ma followed pa to the door.

""now, hush!"" pa said.
""now, hush!"" ma said.
and slowly pa opened up the door.
""now, y'all stop your hollerin', your fussin', and your cussin', 'cause there's nothin' that's a-knockin' at the door.""


""no possum?"" papy said.
""no possum,"" pa said.
""no possum?"" granny said.
""no possum,"" ma said.
then we all started doin' like before.

Granny was a-sittin' while pappy was a-whittlin'.
ma was a-cookin' while pa was a-fixin'.

brother was untanglin'
while sis was tossin' baby.
coon-dawg was a-scratchin' 
while tom-cat was a lickin'.

and i was just a-sittin' and a-lookin' out the winder when i saw what i saw scoot up the old oak tree.


A possum was a-scootin' and a-scramblin' and a-danglin'. that possum that was knockin' made a fool out of me!

dear diary, tonight will be our last
my hands are itching for razors
my angel, this knife shall carve thee wings
consumed by sickness, i ache to see your blood
the hour approaches when i shall lay a nest inside of you

sliced open i lay waste to my desires
sweet entrails are scooped onto the tile

and in my dreams i hold your head beneath the waves
after you've died, i kiss the nape of your porcelain neck
you enter me in death's perpetual embrace
skin tightens in the throes of lust

and in my dreams i cut your mouth from ear to ear
dissecting your angelic body in the quiet of your room
how splendidly i carve into your tender heart
shuddering between the sheets

for weeks i've watched you, perched above your sleeping form
as i caress your perfection
my angel, i'll tear your insides out
my mind is flooding, the marrow of your bones
i cannot subside 'til i have suckled every inch of you

your features now glazed in your own blood
my fingers find home amongst your guts

and in my dreams i hold your head beneath the waves
after you've died, i kiss the nape of your porcelain neck
you enter me in death's perpetual embrace
skin tightens in the throes of lust

and in my dreams i cut your mouth from ear to ear
dissecting your angelic body in the quiet of your room
how splendidly i carve into your tender heart
shuddering between the sheets

whisper your name as you awaken your throat gasps, your skin recoils
we shall be intertwined, entangled in our love
murder beckons as time stops with your voice

""i'll love you forever"" -- and forever it shall be
the knives begin singing, they're weeping for your flesh

the pinnacle of obsession is clawing at the fibers of my mind
the rampant state of elation is heightened by the paleness of your cries
with a promise of absolution, my thoughts are tangled in my creations
with a promise of unequaled pleasure, reason is twisting
the knives are crooning for this perfect end

for weeks i've watched you, perched above your sleeping form
as i caress your perfection
my angel, i'll tear your insides out
my mind is flooding, the marrow of your bones
i cannot subside 'til i have suckled every inch of you

i feel the fibers stretch and tear
unbridled climax is achieved
i've waited so long for this moment
the euphoric act of suicide -- suicide!

~Black Dahlia murder


....my friend paul showed me these lyrics, while im not one for death metal and shiznit...just because of the constant screaming, i love the lyrics. woo go paul."

"event","I feel bleh. You ever get the feeling that you're depressed and you want to just let it all out and tell someone in the hopes that getting if off your chest would do some good but then when you sit down and think about it you don't even know what's depressing you, or that you've just got so many things bouncing around your brain you're really not sure of anything? That's the best way that I can describe how I'm feeling right now.  My mom asked my what was wrong and the best that I could do was shrug. I don't know, I can just go to sleep and hope that in the morning things will be better. I suppose that's all that any of us could do. 

This kicks so much ass, my friend Justin is the singer for a band named Genes Of Distruction...or GOD, and he wrote this, soo kicks ass.

                    A Beautiful Massacre: 


The smell of semen filled the room as I entered my home, I noticed your blouse on the cofee table. The moans got louder, the ripping covers screamed in my ears.. I knew this would be the last night I'd see her... I gracefully walked in holding the flowers I'd bought for her, surprised she quickly apologized, I said hush and pulled out my knife.... how much fun was it to steal her womb, to use his genitals as a tool, its okay, my tears made it look beautiful, like watercolors.... - me - Genes of Destruction


    Oh so beautimus. I give my whodi props. hehe Alrigty yo, I'll talk with yall later."

You need  safety in your relationship.<br>You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing<br>that he will protect you and you can be totally<br>devoted to your other. At this point you are<br>very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont<br>even think that he/she could cheat you. You<br>totally trust your partner in every single way.<br>SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or<br>played a game this trust is broken. You may try<br>to forgive your other but this will be very<br>difficult.He/She has to be friendly and<br>trustworthy.

Katie, they're right, that new song is really good, I loved it. So, to sum up my night, her dad sniffed my crack, ate a lot of pizza, Tony, as always, is a dirty mexican  and I don't know how he manages to find woman, Kevin is awesome, Jamie and I are cool...and Control issue makes me cream my pants. ta ta for now."

You don't remember me,
But I remember you.
I lie awake and try so hard,
Not to think of you.
But who (who) can (can) decide,
What they dream ?
And dream I do...
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
Have you forgotten all I know,
And all we had ?
You saw me mourning my love for you,
And touched my hand.
I knew you loved me then.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
I look in the mirror and see your face.
If I look deep enough.
So many things inside that are just like you are<br>taking over.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me.
I believe in you.
I'll give up everything just to find you.
I have to be with you, to live, to breathe,
You're taking over me,
(You're taking over me),
You're taking over me,
(Taking over me), Taking over me.

"event","wooo...I'm so happy. I ran a mile tonight, it's been so long since I've ran, so it makes me happy that I was able to do it. Now, I'm all energetic and shiznit. I stopped by Kevin's house to see if he wanted to come...but no one answered. *shakes fist* damn you kevin. anypoo...mandy and joe got into two fights today, count em...*holds up fingers* two...I don't know what's going to happen with all of that. Actually, I do...they're going to make up, then find something else to argue about. That's how it always works with them. *sigh* Anyways, I'm lookin for a roommate to share this appartment I'm moving into with. It was going to be Joe, Amanda's fiance because her dad is kicking him out within the next thirty days...but with the way it looks with them, I think if I gave him a place to live when they were arguing she would hate me. Because she would feel ""awkward"" when she came over. I don't know what to do, I need a roommate though, sooooo...yeah. lol I dont even think any of my friends are looking to move out anyway so it doesn't really matter. Alrighty yo, I shall talk to yal later, buh bye."

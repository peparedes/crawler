Heres a post for all you no-lifers that get on here and read live journal like me whenever I'm on.


We play Alexandria this week at Alexandria. They're good but I think we'll win.


Other than that, a lot of things suck right now. Nothing goes right, or if it is, then it all of a sudden goes wrong.  I also don't like how a lot of things are right now. I hate it and I also miss some things and wish things could have just stayed the same and I dont understand why people and the way they are have changed. Yea I understand a lot of things are different because of certain things but just remember what it was you had before that change......That probably won't make any sense to some of you but maybe to someone.


I think I'm getting sick too. I can't breath, I keep coughing, and I don't feel good at all.

I also need to straighten back up and have God 1st in my life again!

Thats about all I can think of..."

This is my once every few months post!


ROOOOLLLLLLLL TIDDEEEE RROOOLLLL!! The Alabama game was awesome except for Prothro getting hurt but they will still be good. they have a lot of talent this year.

Alabama will win the SEC.


Dora beat Montevallo other night 41 to 21. Another region win but next week is Chelsea. After the game me and valdez went over to Twilleys for a little while but I had to hurry up and leave.


Also, I can finally walk now without having a brace on but my knee still doesnt bend a lot.



Thats it.."

"event","I guess my junior year is good so far..I haven't been there enough to know yet. I haven't went a full day of school yet and now I can't even go until whenever??  For those of you that don't know, I tore my ACL and had to have surgery on it Thursday. I got hit in my knee and didnt think anything was wrong other than it being bruised very bad and just hurt a lot, but I knew it wasn't broke because I could still walk so I didnt tell anybody or the coaches and I went back out and had to go in motion on a play and as I was going in motion it gave out on me and snapped and I fell..Thats when I finished it off and tore it. But yea...Life is pretty boring right now. I can't do anything and it's killing me. Luckily people have came over and gave me some company lol and Thanks to all of the football team and cheerleaders for that huge card and all the candy and stuff and just everything and thanks to everybody else.  Dora also won Friday night at St. Clair County. I was there in my wheel chair lol and I cant wait for Thursday night against Cordova. Hopefully I can stand out there instead.. That's what I get to do all season lol. I cant play any.



I need the computer now hunter..come over"

"event","School's started back again and it's alright for now. All my classes are pretty good (I guess).   This summer has been the best summer yet! I did a lot of things with friends and just had a good time. I dont believe their was hardly ever a dull moment in the summer, other than when I was in bed.

Football season is about to start. We have a game on Thursday at St. Clair County and then after that is Game 1 against Cordova. We had a scrimmage game other night and we looked alright. I can't do anything right now because this year is sucking really bad for me so far in football. 1st I get a neck injury and I'm out for almost a week, then I come back & I'm able to hit again and I get a knee injury the first day I'm able to hit again. My knee was popped out place and possibly stretched or torn some ligaments in it. I have to go therapy now for a little while and on Monday for an MRI. Maybe when I'm able to play again I won't have anymore injuries the rest of the season. I also hope we have another perfect season and finally get past the 2nd round of the playoffs!!!

Another thing that's about to start is COLLEGE FOOTBALL!!!!! and I'm ready for that too.  Nothing like Alabama game days!  Maybe Alabama will do good this year too.

I'm ready for it to cool off also. I'm tired of this 90 and up degree weather with a humidity hotter than hell all the time. I hate the hot weather. I'm ready for fall!"

"event","<P><FONT size=4>I hate the end of the month when all of the Old people get their checks and make all their monthly stops to walmart, to eat, to the drug store, to fill up their cars, to buy groceries, and etc... As for the rest of the younger people, like me, all they do is severely piss me off and slow up everything for me. They think it's perfectly fine to pull out in front of me while I'm driving 60 mph and they are too afraid to go above 30 mph, which causes me to slam my brakes on and begin road rage as I pass them! Then once you pass them, It's fine for the old person to speed up then.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Another thing I hate is when I have to go get gas. Pumping the gas doesn't bother me at all but paying for it while their is 30 people in front of you and every one of them wants to buy a months supply of ciggaretes DOES! First of all, if the cashiers or clerks are going to keep the cigarettes with them, They need to know WHERE they are! People are on shedules, like me, and I'm having to wait on someone to kill thereselves before I can pay for my gas!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Another thing I dislike a lot is the fact that some people like to drive as close to people as possible and get as close to you as possible while stopped at a traffic light on a hill. I guess they've never heard of a 5 speed vehicle. Incase they've havent, well They ROLL sometimes just a little. Not a lot but but if sure feels better knowing that i have a foot or two incase I do roll, rather than an inch.</FONT></P>

Then Allison and Kayla Twilley came over and we went to eat with Allison's mom at this Chinese place. After that we went to the Galleria for a little while, then we went to Old Navy, and some shoe store. After that we were driving down the road and they think its funny to steal my money and hide it in places I cant get to lol. They wouldnt give it back till I worked for it and believe me I had to work lol. It was hillarious! Allison and Kayla were about to pee in there pants (I guess) lol but that's all I'm saying about that. We also went by Jakes and paid him a little visit that I didnt want to do lol. Then we went over to Kayla's and now I'm home! 
During work last night Kayla and Allison came there and tried to harass me even more lol!  After I got off work I went over to Kayla's house and watched a movie and was also forced to tell Carrol Twilley I liked her boobies lol"

We went back to the car and decided to get another grape so we went right back in and bought another little grape lol.

Tomorrow I'm leavin to go to the beach and wont be back for a week. This will be another week of no workouts for me so I'm gonna be dieing of soreness when I get back to start football workouts!

After that I came home and the door to my room had tampon things on it and when I opened my door my room had been trashed BAD. It got rolled, my bed was saran wrapped with a million tampons all over it and it had aloe vera lotion all over it, everything was in different places and turned backwards, all the junk under my bed was out from under my bed and all over the place, my windows were window chalked, my sheets on my bed were short sheeted and I didnt realize that till last nite when I tried to get in my bed and I couldnt,  and etc.... IT WAS HORRIBLE!!! And it could only be one person that did it, ALLISON MICHELLE OWENS, but only because I rolled her room the day before lol

It was funny... I told her I jus stop by to say hey but I gotta go now HAHAHA. You know you loved it Caity lol

I study Geometry and think I know it and I still do bad in that class. This sucks. All I've ever made is A's and now I cant even make a C HAHA! The second part of my stupid day was when I had to work out. That killed my arms today for some reason. Its just stupid to do A lot of benching and then they make you do push ups. I hate that but at least I know its makin us all even better lol. The 3rd part of my terrible day came when I got my New computer today. One of my other ones jus stopped workin so I bought a new one and today when I get it and try to turn it on It doesnt work either. I called the company and they told me to buy some new stuff for it and I told them everything is new I jus gave them $850 and Im not payin any more. They can either give me a new computer or give me my money back lol so they are going to give me a new one lol.

"event","The Patriots win again! It's getting old now. 

Yesterday I went to church and then I went to eat and a bunch of other things I cant remember and then I went over to Allisons house to watch the Super Bowl!

On My way to Allison's house I get stopped by a state trooper. He was following me for about 5 minutes and when he pulled me over he said your tag doesnt match your truck??? I had no idea what to do so I thought to lie right then and tell him I just bought my truck yday HAHA & it WORKED lol..He said thats kool and then he asked me where I was going and I told him to Allison Owens house and he told me to hurry up and go get my tag changed over sumtime soon?? Thats stupid..I dont know what hes talkin about. I have the right tag.

I NOW HATE GEOMETRY..I cant pass that class with a decent grade..I've failed every test that I've taken in that class and right now I have a 60 average but all A's in my other classes. Today he gave us a make up test to see if we could do better on it this time. Last time I made a 60 and this time I make a 40. That sucks!



Valentines Day is almost here and yup I dont have a gurl but thats kool..more chocolate candy for me LoL. Theres a bunch of gurls that are sexy as hell (to me they are). Just wish I could get one of them lol


...........................I'm drawing a blank now. GUESS I'm DONE!




Later KIDS!"

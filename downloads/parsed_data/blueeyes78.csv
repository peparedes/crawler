"event","Went to work today, they asked me to work a double, works for me less time I have to spend at home! Plus overtime, so I have more money to put aside for my dream life. 

Those are going to be the days. Me, my huge house in the middle of nowhere and my best friend my computer. LOL 

Oh well doesn't hurt to dream right?"

"event","I am so sick of my life! It's a never ending darkness that I have little control over.
My mother is driving me crazy. It's like I am living the life of cinderella only I will never be a princess and there will never be a prince to rescue me.

Off to work, it sucks but at least I get away from this hellhole!"

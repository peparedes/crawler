If it weren't icy I'm pretty sure that I would have made it down the hill without falling (as many times as I did). But when I went down the bunny the first time I got there I had a really bad fall and my board twisted one way when my legs twisted the other way. 
Well to make a long story short I either pulled a musle in my left left or tore it...I can't bend it that well and hardly walk on it, so I'm going to see what its like tomorrow and then determind if I want to go this friday to Bristol. 
Carli said that Bristol is much bigger and stuff, so I don't want to go to it if I can't really walk on my leg to begin with. 
But I don't know...

Then when I fell once I pull a ligiment I thing&nbsp;in my leg where it conects to&nbsp;the hip. Its hard to walk, but I don't&nbsp;mind. And at one point when I was with Carli and Chris (Treat) I hit ice and fell&nbsp;landing on my wrist, I thought I nearly broke it, but then I&nbsp;felt my fingers after about a minute.

THe most beautiful thing I saw today was when I was waiting for the bus. The sun was rising over the trees and with the colors purple and pink vibrating in the sky. It was beautiful no doubt, but the air was still and all I could her as silence, as the snow lay gently on the ground and trees....

Then all that can be ruined when your science teacher yells at the class because we are suppose to adomatically know everything....
And when you break your sister's car door...

But the world still holds more beauty that theres still yet to see...

For now:)"

School, gah, I'll skip that. 

Then after school....heh

Carli Jo came over and we worked on Science then I cooked her some eggs, a grilled cheese, and made orange juice for her. Then she played ping pong with my brother, I watched....(felion refexes Car...heh:) Then I cracked her back, like 218794792347293 times and massauged it. She did the same, only instead of massauging my back, she decides to beat me up instead....heh. Theeeennnnnnnnn we had some more fun, she decides to pull a magic trick that makes me want to scream in fear. Instead of pulling rabbits out of a hat, she swallows her ring and coughs it back up...omgosh it was so scary, I thought she was going to die...I was freaking out....heh, I nearly had a mild heart attack...
After a while later, she left...aka like five minutes ago. 
Annnddd I'm leaving too

I put up my Christmas Tree, but never finished decorating it. I hate this, I am so not in the Christmas mood, I think I had more enthusiasm for Halloween than I have now for Christmas. I wish I could be ten again, because Carli was right, I was more excited about holidays when I was still a child than I am now. Maybe when the 25th starts to roll around I might show more excitment, for now, I continue to read Hard Love and ignore my moms pleads for help with decorating the lights.

Anyway....a Hallmark movie is on tonight and it has my name on it, its either Hallmark or It's A Wonderful Life, I like that movie, but I prefer White Christmas.

<P><FONT color=#ff6600></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6600>I slept in till like noon, than got ready for two, however no Gray family arrives on time. We actually ate quite early this time, thats surprising. I loaded up on my grandma's white bread, and some turkey (I am a very picky eater). Then I drank too much Ginger Ale and Orange soda. After we ate, the dad's came in and put on the football game, which I was forced to watch for about 20 mins instead of Harry Potter. I couldn't take it anymore, so off to the kitchen. I bonded with my sister some more, when the Ginger Ale started to kick in. I was sort of hyper by than, it was kind of funny. I ate a lot of brownies with mint chocolate chip frosting for desert and drank more soda. I feel bloaded now....I want to puke. Anyway, part my dad and my uncle went on and on about our&nbsp;Globale Warming, which than got everyone in the kitchen to talk about it, and when my dad gets talking he won't stop&nbsp;until&nbsp;he proves that hes right, when half the time hes actually wrong. In my head I was like ""Oh boy..."" That was an interesting conversation. Since I was utterly bored seeing as my sister and me are the ownly teenage girls there, it wasn't very fun, so I came home early...and left my cousin there...ha! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6600>Side note: my cousin Sarah that lived with me last year came up, it was quite a surprise, and now I have to entertain her...which means all the plans I was going to make I can't do....this sucks....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#009900>I got up early to go shopping. Carli helped me pick out snowboarding pants, I got black ones. Then off to <FONT color=#ff6600>Borders Books</FONT>, (if only I had all me money) <FONT color=#ff6600>I could have bought out the store</FONT>. I ended up getting, <FONT color=#3333ff>born </FONT><FONT color=#3333ff>confused,</FONT> by <FONT color=#cc66cc>Tanuja Desai Hidier</FONT>, after <FONT color=#cc66cc>Carli recomended it,</FONT> it sounds really good. I am currently reading <FONT color=#000099>True </FONT><FONT color=#000099>Believer</FONT> by <FONT color=#000099>Virginia Euwer Wolff</FONT>, for the second time. <FONT color=#3366ff>True Believer is a mix between Hard Love, and Speak</FONT>. After Borders, we went to a Chinesse Shop for <FONT color=#993399>dumplings, my favorite food in the world</FONT>. Then off to Greece Mall, to find a birthday present for my friends, 16th birthday. I was successful, and I got Carli's gift for Chrismas. By the time shopping was over, I was exausted, and now my parents friends are over and were are having a fancy dinner. Tomorrow I get my hair cut, I can't wait, maybe I will do something drastic, or not. </FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>I am going to deleate my yesterdays entries. I may be able to delete my words, but I won't be able to delete my feelings. If I could, than life would be easier. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>I shouldn't be punished for talking about what I feel, if this is what happens than how the hell am I suppose to open up and let people understand, how the hell am I suppose to show who the ""real me"" is all about?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>When I&nbsp;posted my entry yesterday, I wasn't looking for a battle among my friends, I wasn't looking to end a friendship that means so much to me. All I wanted was for people to understand, but I guess that wasn't possible and&nbsp;instead you guys took it in the wrong way. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>I am going to start over, I am going to let people see the real me, because I am tired of these&nbsp;games of trying to fit in so everyone will like me. Only&nbsp;I forgot who the ""real me"" was. I haven't been 100% fake all this time, but I haven't been 100% real either. It's&nbsp;funny, because I don't even know what real is&nbsp;either. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>I feel that if&nbsp;I try this then things can get better, because thats how I made friends with Emma, Carli, Casey, Chrissy, Jamie, and Claire. Even Dale, but I don't think he remembers much. These are friendships that I don't want to loose, not over this. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>I'm not asking for us to forget all about it, I just don't want it to tear us apart. I'm ready to change, because you guys are right, I do act differently around certian people and I don't want to do that anymore. But I don't want to do this alone, please, I am sorry and all I want is forgiveness. Can you just give me that...</FONT></P>

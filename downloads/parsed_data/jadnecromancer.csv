"event","I have come to notice a few odd little yellow bird type creatures. they seem to be made out of some soft substence.

I cought 3 of them and began conducting some experiments. One melted wich was an intresting reaction, while another had a unique reaction to liquid. I have cadged the off spring in a sepret container lableing them gen 2. 

I wish I had a more sutible lab to use... but, sometimes we must slum it.

If anyone out there is intrested in asisting me I would be greatful, its rediculous trying to start and set up a lab without at least one assistent."

Ive forgotten what its like to try and convince people they want to hire you as apposed to convincing them you don't want the job. 

Hopefuly one of my options will pull through, I would hate to think what I would need to do if they did not.

Now that I have more or less have aquired started the rituals of getting an income, I should look around this fair city and get to know my way around."

"event","It seems I find my self in an entirly alien place. Not that I am put off by it. but... adjusting to the idea of making a perminent stay here is not apealing at all. My work will be set back, and the idea of looking for a job is rediculous. 

I can only hope Peony will not fall apart on his own. 

Though the first line of bussness should be securing an income. and one that will suport me idealy. I supose I should put out an add, there must be something a scientist acomplished fonist, as well as a military comander could do. though, I would hope to find something kind to me since I am getting on in my years and would rather not have to do grunt work or rise up through the ranks."

"event","man today has been pretty busy.  i woke up so sore because of working out yesterday.. so i messed around til my 10am class.. which is now west. civ.  its a lecture class of like 200 people, but its cool.  i have a lot of friends in there so yay.  then i went to my earth history class which is a bore to me but oh well.  after that me and bryant went to foosackley's and got some lunch.. i came back and went and got my menigitis shot which, actually, didnt hurt at all.  then i went to picklefish (food place across campus) to put in an app.  i had an interview for an office job today but i decided i love moving and talking to people at work and well.. thats a waitress.  so anywho.. went and saw bryant before he went to work.  then i came here and actually accomplished stuff!  took the trash out, went to the gamma commons to wash clothes... while there i read/outlined chapter 1 for my social problems class.  came back and walked to the student center to get a mailbox but they were closed (ARGH) came back.. filled out application for freshman leadership council club.. then while i ate dinner (celery, carrots, tomatoes) i searched the phonebook for possible restuarants to work in.  so now im about to type up a short paper for my social problems class then do some math homework.  try to get to bed early tonight.. maybe go for a walk before i get a shower and stuff.  tomorrow night there is a skate party, hells yea.  going skating.  i miss my friends.  ;(  i am thinking of making this a friends-only jrnl.  what does everything think?  yay or nay?  no one comments anymore.  bleah."

"event","man i cant even believe im in college, it just doesnt seem right.  my first class was an 8am, but it is jogging so i like that.. wake up and run.. good stuff.  we just went over the syllabus and we came back.. and we dont meet again til next monday so w00!  it is just a mon/wed class anyway.  

so i came back here and lolligagged around.  then i decided to drive to the humanities building to go to my us history class.. BAD IDEA.  there were so many people!!!  so after nearly crying, i parked and run up 3 flights of stairs to go to my class about 10 minutes late.  lovely.. the teacher seems like a dud.. which sucks bc it is an awesome topic.  us history since 1877!?  fuck yea!  anyway im gonna go read some of the book and outline the chapters here in a second..

then i go to earth history.. my class with bryant.  this class he LOVES.  it is like, the history and origin of the earth since the big bang theory, going into evolution and stuff so he is sitting next to me all amazed while im having to stab myself to stay awake.  good thing he does like it though, because we have lab homework and he is definitely my study buddy ;D

after that me and him went to laidlaw then to the book store because i had the wrong history books somehow.. so i got the right ones then i came back here and looked for jobs.  i went and put in an applications at the UCOMM (where communication majors spend their days) for a desk job at the publications office.  hopefully i will hear back from there ::crosses fingers::

so anyway im just sitting around eating a snack/lunch (celery, cherry tomatoes and carrots) and about to do some history work.  it is about to storm again.  i do love these afternoon thunderstorms.. they're nice.  tonight i have a gamma housing meeting (ugh) and then there is an SGA (student government association) party over in the front lawn of epsilon so im gonna mosey on over there.  then early to bed for another day of new classes.. wooo"

"event","you know.. not getting in chi O is hitting me a lot harder than i thought.  i guess for some reason i just feel like i wasnt good enough, or something is wrong with me or something.  i guess i was looking forward to that family feel so much, and now i just feel like im not cool enough or something.  i dont think i have ever felt like this.. and i know i shouldnt because some of the people i met still wanna hang out with me so.. i dunno.  tonight made it better, i went and hung out with clay and levi, two cool guys i met at orientation.. while there the guys across the hall came over, there were 4 of them so i met all of them then i met 2 other guys that came by... so i guess i feel better now that i am making friends.  one of the guys i met tonight is in my tennis class so that is cool too.  i guess im just really nervous, im sure it is nothing but my expectations of college and of me are so high and i feel as if i have already failed.  im sure in a few weeks from now, i will feel so much better about everything.  i will be exercising and making friends, hopefully working and joining different organizations.  i just need to set my mind straight, but i just feel like a failure.  i wish i could stop it.. but it is just hard.  i shouldnt take it personally, but i do.  well, time to lay down.  class tomorrow!  will update tomorrow =)"

im on my mom's computer.  i came home tonight because i was pretty upset over the sorority thing.. i didnt get in chi omega.  there are complications with it, they wanted me however there were a lot of girls who wanted in that one and they got it over me.  its long and boring just know im really upset about it, but i dont regret it at all because i met so many great people that im going to continue being friends with and it was a great experience and i had a great time.  this just means this yr im gonna have more time to work, get some money, make sure my academics are awesome, and do some other organizations.  but im just happy i made some of the friends i did.. but man oh man did i cry! ;(

anyway so i came home to go out to eat with my mom and sister and then going out with some friends tonight.  i think we're going bowling, at least i hope so.  i miss my friends.. i love mobile but i have been so lonely over there.  im so ready for classes to make some friends and what not.  but i will NEVER EVER forget the friends i have here.  i love those guys (& gals!) wayy too muchh!!

"event","'Lindsay's Light' to shine on Pas Beach

PASCAGOULA -- The spirit of Lindsay Miller continues to shine in her hometown. 

The 2003 Miss Pascagoula High School who was killed in a traffic accident last year will be remembered with a community bonfire and praise and worship concert on the Pascagoula Beach on Sept. 11, the one-year anniversary of her death. 

Jen Russell, one of the organizers, said the date may bring negative images to many, but those who knew 19-year-old Miller will instead have ""a celebration"" to mark the date and ""we kinda want to bring some joy to that day."" 

     
Russell will ask the City Council tonight for permission to place signs around town promoting the event, called ""Lindsay's Light."" 

The event will be on a Sunday and Russell said that should spark added attendance of area church groups. She said organizers may sell T-shirts and other items with the proceeds to go to a local charity dear to Miller. 

Charlotte Underwood, 18, saw Miller's work up close in the PHS Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Judgment House, a yearly theatrical performance depicting why young adults need to make wise life decisions Miller spearheaded at her home church, First Baptist Church in Pascagoula. 

""She was always someone I looked up to and admired,"" said Underwood, who is beginning her freshman year at Mississippi College. She will travel to Mississippi College soon with Miller's twin brother, Josh, Mr. PHS of 2003, who was seriously injured in the accident that also killed the Millers' friends, Maksim Sisoev, 20, a senior at MC from Uzbekistan, and Beth Finch, 19, Mississippi's 2003 Junior Miss from Clinton, while they were traveling from school to Pascagoula. 

Krystal Teston, 22, of Slidell, La., will appear in Harrison County Circuit Court in October to face a DUI charge in the death of the three students. 

Lindsay Miller's commitment to God and others was well-known, solidified when she helped save the life of transplant recipient Elizabeth Carpenter, 25, of Magee, who received Miller's heart. 

Underwood, also known for her gospel singing talents, said Miller was full of grace and the community-wide event fits that spirit. 

""You couldn't be around Lindsay for five minutes and not know everything she stood for was the love of Christ,"" Underwood said. ""She just glowed with the love of God and that captivated her."" 

Miller -- also known for accepting others -- was opinions editor of the Mississippi College newspaper, The Mississippi Collegian. Her formative years in Pascagoula were also special. 

Missy Abston, teacher sponsor of the PHS Student Council and co-sponsor of the school's FCA, said current student council members were already wanting to do something to honor Miller when they heard organizers of ""Lindsay's Light"" had already begun preparations. 

""She meant a lot to a lot of students and was a strong leader and (they) looked to her for a lot of strength,"" Abston said. ""They were looking for some closure, and this is a way to not let her memory fall. Her memory and everything she stood for needs to be carried on."" 

Hundreds of young adults and others attended Miller's funeral despite the evacuation of the Mississippi Gulf Coast for Hurricane Ivan. 

Lindsay Miller worked at Hebrew's, a coffee and pastry house owned by Russell's brother and Miller's friend, Josh. Jen Russell remembers talking in the bakery about life with her sometimes until 2 or 3 in the morning. 

""Lindsay was very much an old soul,"" Jen Russell, 29, said. ""I miss her to pieces."""

"event","so last night was the first night of rush.. and i absolutely loved it.  i have been hearing that the sororities here are completely different than other schools and their right.  the girls are so nice, it isn't your typical ""aha im a sorority girl hehe!"" type thing.  the one i am most interested in is chi omega, which has held the dean's cup for 10 yrs for the highest academic acheivement and their philanthropy goes towards the make-a-wish foundation.  i really liked a lot of the girls i talked to last night.  if i get invited for chi omega, i just might do it.  of course, who knows, i might not.  i doubt i would pay to be in any other one though.  

anyway right now it is like 5:45 am.  i woke up at like 4:30 and i was wide awake.  i feel kinda sick, stuffy nose and stuff so i couldnt really go back to sleep so i decided just to go ahead and get up.  what the hell, right?   so im drinking some green tea, thinking about going for a walk here in a second.  then yanno, shower, work, rush party

woo!

i cant believe i start classes monday.  crazy stuff my friend, crazy stuff!

apparently the computer doesnt like playing dvds... so no dvds... i have no books.  but now, i am a free cell queen as well.  that game can be hard ass but i love it.  im about to nod off here, im pretty damn tired.  i would love to get in the shower right now, i took one last night, but i usually like one in the morning.  I CANNOT BELIEVE I MOVE IN TO THE DORMS IN 2 DAYS I CANT WAIT!!!

im really excited.  im working til 1 tomorrow then heading home.  ah, home.. i do miss it.  as much as i love bryant im getting tired of staying at his apartment.  its so lonely over there, MARSHALL HURRY UP AND MOVE.  but oh, what bryant did the other night was sweet.  we kinda had an argument sunday noon before i went to the movies and stuff with my mom, and i get to the apartment and there are red rose petals, EVERYWHERE.  GAH!  i had to follow a trail to the bedroom where there was a rose and a really sweet note and it was just like, petals!  ah, it was great.  then last night he didnt have to work so we had planned on getting a pizza and just watching a movie and relaxing bc i was tired and stuff, and i get home and he had went out and bought stuff to cook a romantic candle-lit dinner.  it was very very sweet.  and the food wasnt half bad.  then we watched beyond the sea w/ kevin spacey which is just an amazing movie.

speaking of movies i cant wait to see 40-yr old virgin and RENT (YAYY!!!) and and HARRY POTTER !!!!  only 3 months my friends, only 3 more months!

anywho.. i really wanna go to the perk preview thurs night but i have so much stuff to do and i dont feel like driving over there and stuff.. sorry robi, but i love you!!!  you can come see me in my dorm since you know how to get there now!  merherher

anywho so i move in 3 days.  hooooly crap!  for some reason, i dunno why, i am so sad.  i just cant get happy.. i think i just woke up in a bad mood.. didnt sleep well at all, was cold.  i was really lonely for some reason.. i dunno why.  i just wanna kind of cry but i have no real reason.  i am happy about saturday though.  for the afternoon rachel, anna, and mary v are coming over to see my dorm and then we're going out to eat.  i need a good outing with the gals, it will be our last time together which makes me really sad.  these 3 girls have really been my best friends this past year.  i dont think me and rachel will ever lose touch, hell we made it this far.  then saturday night me and bryant are going out to celebrate 3 things: him living in the apartment, me moving in the dorms, and our 7-month anniversary is the next day.  we're going to see must love dogs (second time for me but it is just that good) and out to eat at zea... my FAVORITE #%*#$%&*!@!  woo exciting.

so yea.. its only 10 am!  and im already bored!  but as long as im not cold i am happy.. i guess i have things i can do, i've been making a list of things i need to do thursday.  i am coming home thursday to pack and stuff.. maybe i will see if rach wants to go out to eat or something.  i need to go up to the highschool to get my yrbk since the bastards didnt tell me they were doing it at registration.  i want to go up to perk to see the preview but i dont wanna drive over there since i have been driving back and forth to mobile and me, and my gas tank, are tired of it!!!  but i would love love love love to see my friends that i miss so much.. -sighs-

i am very excited about this tabula rasa i get soon.  should be quite an experience

well i think i will go play some solitaire.  adios"

"event","yanno, it feels erally good to be home and kinda recharge my batteries and what not.  i've been kinda sick, i was really sick last night when i got home.  my throat hurt really bad and i laid in bryants bed in long pants, long sleeve shirts, socks over my feet and hands and freezing freezing cold but i was running a temperature.  and my entire body was just aching with pain.  IT SUCKED!  i took some advil and my temp went down and i felt a bit better.  

so today hasnt been much of anything productive, which is exactly what i intended.  had a hair appointment at 8am.. went for a swim which was stupid of me bc my throat hurts really bad so being under water made my throat/ears hurt more not to mention it has been raining so the water was like -283182 degrees and me, being the person i am, didnt test the waters and just dived in.  needless to say i didnt swim long.  

oh i might be buying my sisters camry.. it all depends.  someone was going to look at it today and if they dont buy it, then im getting it in september after chad boswell buys my car.  awesome, huh?  i really really hope i get it, i will be oh-so-happy!  

so tomorrow im going BACK to mobile, im taking some of my crap so it will be something less to move friday.. then me, kristen and my mom are going to the movies and out to eat and to go see karen and the new baby.  speaking of which here are some pictures <a href=http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/sfblake1/album?.dir=/f0a6&.src=ph&.tok=pho8OaDBtK.icn6b target=""_blank""> sarah rose</a>

anyway im dying for a whirlpool bath and i think tonight will be spent in bed.. playing leisure suit larry followed by an early bed time.  my batteries are completely drained!

ok adios!

ps... i dunno if anyone has heard/heard of the spin doctors (if you heard the song little miss cant be wrong you'd know) but i won tickets to go see them tues night at a restaurant in spanish fort... so me and bryant are going but apparently you have to be like 19 or something but im gonna see if i can get in anyway since the radio station where i won the tickets got my age.. ::shrugs::"

"event","sudhfjsksfd holy crap.  i got curious with the mase and now im like choking and crying.  i didnt even spray it in my face, just in the area where im at.  where am i at?  working in mobile!  this job is so boring, i basically finish all my work within 2 hrs then the rest of the day i sit here and do whatever.  of course, im on dial up so i cant stay online. i have harry potter book 4 in my car but that is in the parking garage across the street and im not about to go over there.  i've already had like 23984 bad experieces.  got lost on the way to work (never driven here) then got here, something was wrong with the computer so my 2 hr work took about 4... then bryant got messed up coming over here then we eat lunch, find out they dont take visa, so they tell me to go to regions bank.. wouldnt take my card.. neither would southtrust.. or compass.. finally amsouth did.  did i mention this was all walking.. in the pouring rain?  and now im soaked?  in a freezing cold office where i have no control of the air?  now i have nothing to do?  yea, NOT MY BEST DAY.  adSFKU@#J$U! 

anyway so im living with bryant basically, im coming home fri/sat then coming back over sunday to work mon-thurs then thurs night im going home to wash/pack then i move friday and start living in my dorms.  exciting, aye?  i went shopping yesterday.  oh and the day before, i dunno if i told you guys that but i got some AWESOME capris.  they're brownish and they flare at the bottom, omg hot.  well i found a coralish shirt to go with and its really cool too.  and i got a multi-layered tank top and it is really long so that is cool.  AND I FOUND GREEN CURTAINS!!!  they're from jc pennys and they're like strips of fabric, yanno what i mean?  meh, anyway

so yeah, thats about it for now.  i bascially sit here until 4:30 then i go back to the apartment.  which bryant has to work so i just kinda sit there by myself.  i will probably watch anchorman and go get some food for me and bryant (to eat when he gets home) other than that not too much is going on.. just.. sitting

ok well perk people lemme know how it is and RACHEL I WILL MISS YOU WHEN YOU GO TO MILLSAPS

"event","hey you guys!  i just thought i would let my fans know my status, since you havent heard from me in what, like a day?  so yesterday i mosied (sp?) on over and babysat while karen went to the doctor, then about 5 went to go help bryant move.  man that boy has a lot of crap!  we got a pretty good bit over to the apartment, it was so much fun moving stuff but man it wore us out.  it was nice though, we just ordered a pizza and watced kevin smith (from jay and silent bob) and it was hilarious.  we passed out around 1am, which only lasted an hr for me when karen called at 2am because her water broke.  so i drove over, somehow made it alive, and crashed over here.  got up around 6am.. and slept off and on til 8:30 when my mom got here and we woke up joel (karens son.. about.. nearly 2 yrs old) and he has been teething so he is kinda running a fever and not really happy.  from 9-11 i took a nap since i only had like 3 hrs of sleep prior to that.  then i got up and found out karen gave birth about 10:48 to a girl named sarah rose.  :D

so me and mom took joel and we went to eat at applebee's then to babies 'R' us to go shopping for some little outfits then came back here and joel is napping.  it is (or was) raining pretty hard and i need to go out to USA to pay for my tuition and stuff.. i might go in a bit.  i dunno what my plan is for tonight.. or the rest of the week for that matter.. though i wish i knew.  but anywho, hope everyone is doing great.  still cant believe i move in 9 days, ahhh holy crappers!  ok guys, im outtie"

"event","yesterday was good.  me and bryant went to malbis to go to the eastern shore center.  world market didnt have my lime green curtains so im really sad about that, but i got some string lanterns and artworks and a cute skirt and some earrings so its all good.  of course, i cant find lime green curtains anywhere else it seems.  oh well.. then we ate tgi friday and went back to his house, took a nap, and we went out to usa so i could walk between the classes i go to in order to ease my anxiety about not getting to class.  i feel better now.  woo!

these next few days are gonna be kind of busy.  today i have the dermatologist at 10, gotta come home and pack and junk, go to mobile... babysit for karen while she goes to the doctor.  she is due today (she is preggers for those that didnt know) but they arent going to induce today.  then im going to help bryant move stuff in his new apartment (wee!) stay the night with him.. then i work in mobile tomorrow.. *ugh* then hang out with bryant, but not for too long.. come home tuesday night, wednesday i have rotary club luncheon for my scholarship but my mom isnt going to be there with me so i dont even wanna go anymore.. then i probably have to go back to karens because they are going to induce her if she hasnt already gone.  then thursday and friday are probably going to be spent over there or something.  major suckage

and robi, i totally know what you mean about not feeling like its time and what not, i feel the exact same.  =X"

on other words, tonight was awesome!  the sneak preview was really good, still a shock not to be down there.  oh well, afterwards was so much fun though.  me bryant robi scott and donovan went to china garden (MMMM) then to see wedding crashers (again for me and scott) man i LOOOVe that movie.  personally though, bryants laughter was probably one of the funniest things. but it was great to be in such great company.  and that movie is just awesome.  anywho so i dropped everyone off and me and bryant went to jerry lee's.  other than all this, not much going on.

blah.  eveyrthing has just been blah to me for the past few days.  i dont know what it is but i cant really snap out of it.  i guess i just need something adventerous or new or exciting or something.  maybe im just weird but this sucks yanno.  its like that episode of family guy where they talk about purgatory.  it isnt good but it isnt bad.  thats been my state of mind lately.

so tomorrow talent show/womanless beauty pageant at band hall.. maybe hang out with some friends afterwards.. friday is the sneak preview .. then once again hang out.  saturday im working.. not really much else going on.

you know what i love?  being in the most random place and realizing bryant is so perfect for me, and that he is all mine and nothing will change that, and that he treats me so amazing and he is just all-around great to me.  i appreciate him more than i show sometimes, and i love him to death.  i love realizing it all, just to know he is always gonna be there for me, with so much love.  all i want is to return it, which i plan on.... for a long time

he got me the new harry potter *squeals* HOWEVER i didnt re-read #5 like i needed to so im zooming through #5 so i can start on #6.  but im uber-excited.  im gonna be reading all day tomorrow.

"event","im telling ya man, rachel has got some serious balls (not literally, yanno) but man... i went yesterday to kaoz where she was getting her tongue pierced and oh buddy *barfs* i imagine watching it was probably worse than getting it done, and seeing the needle go through and hearing her kinda... moan in pain?  yikes.  she is one hardcore bitch ;D thats a compliment rachel.  btw you seriously need to post the pictures i took, perhaps as soon as your tongue stops swelling.

i, on the other hand, am absolutely loooooving my nose ring.  

so yesterday i went to bryants fairly early.  we spent most of the afternoon out.  ate lunch, went to the pet store (trying to find mice!) went to target, then to kaoz to support rachel.  afterwards it was dinner time so we went to bangkok, being the first place we ever went out on a date to, it was really nice.  then we finally went home and just chilled.  it was so nice to be in his arms.  things have been so amazing lately, except for perhaps the distance is really starting to get to us.  of course, we've waited 6 months now, only one more month before i am finally over there.  well technically, im going to be working in mobile for like 3 weeks or so prior to school starting, so actually i dont know where im going to be living.  its gonna be a weird 3 or so weeks.

its like 8:10 and im seriously dead tired.  i thinking i might jump in a hot shower, come back and climb into bed (in bryants pajamas that i stole/he gave me) and CRASH considering i've been up since 6am!  bryant is coming over tomorrow, i am going to hayley's party for like an hr then to work.. which is probably pointless then who knows what.  sunday i have nothing planned, hopefully read the new harry potter. monday im working with karen again and tuesday is DCI, wee!  uhm i think that is about it.

man i wish bryant was here.  i saw him for like 45 minutes today at satori before he went off to work.  the poor guy is gonna be surrounded by harry potter freaks (proud one) and im not sure he is gonna be able to handle it.  although he is just as big of a dork, but of course, he has to do this til 2am.  that sucks for him =X but he will get over it.  merherher!  anyway i am SUPER tired and i think i might go write an email

oh i changed my schedule AGAIN for south.. now it is:

MW 8-9 Jogging 
MWF 10:10-11 US History Since 1877
MWF 11:15-12 Earth Sciences 
M 12:15-1:45 Earth Sciences Lab 
 
TR 9:30-10:20 Tennis 
TR 11:00-12:15 Social Problems  
TR 12:30-1:45 Finite Math  

not bad not bad.  especially since friday i only have classes from 10-12 basically.  wee!

ok cold feet need hot shower.  ciao!

so this week, lemme see.... im supposed to work tomorrow (if we're open) then this week im gonna be in mobile training with karen.. she is going to be having another kid soon and while she is on 4-weeks of maternity leave, her boss actually wants me to work for her, 5 days a week (i think) and im getting paid.  woo money!!  =D so i will basically be living in mobile for a while. then school starts, kick ass my friend, kick ass.

so although my eyes are glued to the tv, i think im gonna go work on a ""project"" .. i wish bryant was with me, i have an aching to use my mad scrabble skills and no one here will play with me.

  Well last night was not the greatest night!! The guy I thought I could actully have something with turn out to be an asshole too!! He started talking to his ex again so he might get back w/her. Well good luck to him ...but it really got me mad cause I got sick for going out with him and he told me all kinds of nice stuff and now it's like he never meant any of it. Well I don't know why I'm going through so much shit but it better all be for a good reason. Well I'm just giving up on guys right now there too much drama...I rather stay single and just have fun on my own. Well it turns out that I might go to Orlando Florida for vacation!!:D I'm really excited about that...I hope we do go ..at least I can have something to look forward on. Well gtg now bye!!
                                    Luv Lots!!

Well A lot has happened This past year!! Let me start ...One of my ex-boyfriends wanted to hook up with me again during the school year ..well we begin talking and I waited 4 months for him and now all of a sudden he doesn't want anything to do with me!! I was really sad at first cause I dissed a lot of really nice guys for him and now it's like all over!! He said we can still be friends and that's cool n all but I think it's messed up that he made me wait this hole time and then change his mind!!Well I told him I moved on to another guy and guess what ??!! I did!!! I'm so happy ..the guy I moved on too is one of the guys I had to diss b4 but it turns out he still like's me and well I like him too!! We already talked about everything and well were hoping we can get together later on !! I guess everything happened for a reason!! Well I don't want to get my hopes high cause that's what I did before and it turned out bad so im just gonna let everything happen when it's suppose to happen. Well I gtg now !! Bye!!

                                Luv lots!!

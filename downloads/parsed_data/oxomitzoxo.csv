"event","<font size=""2"">in a relatively rushed fashion the holiday season is upon us.&nbsp; this time, i'm in a good place - mentally, emotionally, and physically.&nbsp; i feel stable, grounded...happy.&nbsp;&nbsp; and i'm more excited about the holidays than i have been in quite some time.&nbsp; we've already started putting up some mchristmas decorations.&nbsp; i love it!!&nbsp; i've even bought a few christmas presents already!&nbsp; fabulously enough--thats not what the season is about.&nbsp;&nbsp; for me, its a good thing to show appreciation for your loved ones...but you should do it all year long!!&nbsp;&nbsp; and at this point in the year, especially this year--i like to look back on myself..&nbsp; and realize all that i have to be thankfull for, and think about all the many things that have brought me to where i am right now (layin in the middle of MY living room floor typing on my lap top watching rent on dvd with dana)&nbsp;&nbsp; i'm sure many many people do this at this time of year, being thanksgiving and all~but, for me..i just need to!!&nbsp; <br />so, the things i'm thankfull for - everyday..<br />my little man wyatt--the most beautiful little boi i have ever encountered.&nbsp; his soul is simply amazing.&nbsp; his laughter is infectious.&nbsp; and his hugs make me melt.&nbsp; he is everything to me.&nbsp; &lt;33<br />my dana--the most amazing boifriend i have ever experienced (which of course goes without saying).&nbsp; he really and truly is an amazing person.&nbsp; he grounds me when i get flighty, and checks me when i'm over stressed, and loves me unconditionally.&nbsp;&nbsp; without him, even for a day or two, i feel...sad.&nbsp; he's my half.&nbsp; &lt;3<br />my friends--all of you.&nbsp; as far and distant as we may be, or as close and constantly in contact as we can be.&nbsp; i think of you everyday.&nbsp; and my heart is always with all of you.&nbsp; (and thats not just a line--i really and truly mean that)&nbsp; sm,hs,bh,sm,kk,jv,id..(if i left your initials off its not cuz i don't love you!!!)&nbsp; strength is always drawn from places unseen...i have a true and earnest believe that that place is from the hearts of your friends...though distant as they may be...their energies, love is always there--and ready to be shared when needed.<br />my family--without them i would never have climbed my way up from dirt poor single mom sharing a room with her tiny baby to a relatively sucessfull employee at a fantastic cardiac office, working on getting an associates degree to help people, living in an apartment and standing again on my own two feet.&nbsp; there will always be arguements and disputes, but at the end of the day--my family is always there...to love, to standby, and to accept.&nbsp; thankyou.<br />and this year--the biggest thing to happen to me, was massage school.&nbsp; my girls at mcintosh college.&nbsp; The Weekend Warriers!&nbsp; never did i think that school would change me as much as this year has.&nbsp; it helped me find myself, get comfortable in my skin, and realize where my heart and soul are routed in life outside of my home.&nbsp; where my passion for medicine can bloom into something bigger than i am.&nbsp; where i can learn anything new, and make suggestions and be un-judged, and guided to a better me.&nbsp; though the hours are long and tiring, and the homework is intense and bothersome at times.&nbsp; i truly have found who i am through the help of my mcintosh girls.&nbsp;<br /><br />i will never say that i am complete.&nbsp; because i am of the belief that growth ends and completeness come only in the moments before death.&nbsp; i am not complete, and i am no where near done growing.&nbsp; but at least now i can identify with myself, and i feel good in my skin.&nbsp; i feel good about what i do.&nbsp; and who i am.&nbsp; :o)&nbsp; i wish that feeling for everyone in the world.&nbsp; its a beautiful feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />when i feel that comfort, that understanding in myself.&nbsp; which fades and grows with each changing day.&nbsp; its when i can be enlightened and whole.&nbsp; when i can learn the best, be open to new ideas, be open to allow new people into my close-knit circle that i keep shut to avoid being hurt to this day.&nbsp; (thanks to the past for that little trigger)&nbsp;&nbsp; and its when i can realize...that no matter what plans i had in the past, and no matter what i thought i was supposed to become.&nbsp; this is what i am--and i wouldn't change it for the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; its very easy to be bitter when your life-path is changed by something external.&nbsp; i have a much easier time now not being bitter.&nbsp; as a matter of fact, i love where i've ended up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />my little man, my schooling, my future path of employment, my love, my friends.&nbsp; i wouldn't change any of it.&nbsp; i have no regrets.&nbsp;&nbsp; and thats a beautiful thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />that seems to be my biggest goal in life.&nbsp; is to never give up.&nbsp; never get down.&nbsp; and never regret.&nbsp; because truthfully enough--though cloudy as the appearance may be--everything works out the way its supposed to.&nbsp; just keep going, stand strong, and you'll find that place...where it all makes sense, fits, and is beautiful.<br /><br />i could probably go on for hours about my new philosophy on life, and where i stand with myself.&nbsp; but that would be boring...so i'll keep my thoughts to myself, for now.&nbsp;or, at least some of them.&nbsp;<br />i'm just glad that...i am.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />something bigger than i am.&nbsp; something bigger than any of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />just a year in the life.&nbsp;&nbsp; a bat of the eye.&nbsp; growth.&nbsp; love.&nbsp; life.&nbsp; a flip of the calandar.&nbsp;&nbsp; where will we all be next year??<br /><br />in anycase...<br />to all of you, whomever listens to my ramblings and takes the time to read my chilled typed words..&nbsp; happy holidays.&nbsp; happy year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

who knows..&nbsp;&nbsp; i guess, i just want to preserve our friendship.&nbsp; i want to be sure that, if we truly aren't meant to be together...not saying that we don't love each other - just that..who knows what could happen?&nbsp;<br />so, we're playing it cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; hanging out on occasion - but not nearly as much as is usual for us.&nbsp; just giving it time.&nbsp; mostly cuz my feelings are hurt.&nbsp; crushed really.&nbsp; and i need the time, space, air to breathe, and heal, and think.&nbsp; in the meantime...<br />we're still very much excited over our apartment which is fast coming.&nbsp; moving day is 18days away now.&nbsp; -yikes-&nbsp; i have barely anything packed...nah, make that NOTHING packed.&nbsp; but, i do have new things stored away.&nbsp; and i have been getting rid of lots and lots of things round here.&nbsp; so its nice.&nbsp; a nice little change of pace!&nbsp; ahh i can't wait.&nbsp; i just hope that Dana and i can work things out so that...if nothing else, we're respectfull friends.&nbsp; &lt;3&nbsp; hopefully more?&nbsp; :o)<br /><br />this weekend was isabelle's christianing.&nbsp; so yes, i am a Godmother.&nbsp; -yay-&nbsp; :o)&nbsp; she was adorable.&nbsp; and i HAVE to post pics at some point of my little GQ man.&nbsp; Wyatt was simply a casanova at the party after the church service.&nbsp; he was soo suave in trying to ""make friends"" with Shannon's 18month old daughter Brooke.&nbsp; adoreable.&nbsp; we have pics of him with his arm on her shoulder, and giving her hugs/kisses, and gently touching her cheek.&nbsp;&nbsp; gettin the moves on early!&nbsp;&nbsp; omg was it hilarious - and wicked cute!&nbsp; &lt;3&nbsp;&nbsp; sorry shan...prom nights coming..&nbsp;&nbsp; hahaha&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />other than that.&nbsp; school is winding down for the semester - only 2weeks left.&nbsp; thank goodness.&nbsp; this one has been rough rough rough.&nbsp; i can't wait for the *break* (not that i have time off really - the one weekend we have off..i'm moving) but, whatever.&nbsp; only 24weeks til graduation!&nbsp; hahaha (24 school weeks that is)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />its funny.&nbsp; i'm actually no where near concerned about my ""love"" life right now.&nbsp; i feel like i should be..but i'm not.&nbsp; i'm kinda at the point where i'm resolved.&nbsp; if we're going to work, we will.&nbsp; and if we don't, its not for lack of my trying.&nbsp; so i'm okay.&nbsp; will i be upset? will i cry? oh yea.&nbsp; especially once the stabbing feelings of hurt are gone.&nbsp; but i know deep down that i've done all i can.&nbsp; sometimes fate really just guides the way.&nbsp; or maybe--this is all just a test to see how strong we really can be.&nbsp; but at some point, some point relatively soon - things need to be made clear.&nbsp; we are, or we aren't.&nbsp; and i'm not talking long term.&nbsp; we've been dating for a very long time.&nbsp; its time to grow up a little bit.&nbsp; i'm not saying today-tomorrow- but within the next year or so.&nbsp; definitely.&nbsp; &lt;3&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless.&nbsp; i thought i'd be more upset having words come out of my brain about us not being together...but really, i kinda have that ""it has to be"" feeling.&nbsp; like when a person is really really sick, suffering, and they die.&nbsp; does it hurt that they're gone? yes...but deep down, and maybe on the surface too - you know that they're better off not suffering, life wasn't fair anymore to have to live in pain/disease/whatever.&nbsp; ... this is kind of how i feel.&nbsp; will a miracle happen and save us?&nbsp; i don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp; but if it doesn't...i know that i loved with my everything and i gave it my all.&nbsp; and sometimes people - no matter what love they have...just don't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />2weeks from now the words that i'm saying may ring true.&nbsp; they also may have been brushed off as a ""HA - we beat that test..""&nbsp; i'm not sure.&nbsp; we've been through a lot.&nbsp; we've been tried a million times.&nbsp; i have faith.&nbsp; but i'm not clinging to string either.&nbsp; i guess..i just feel strong right now.&nbsp; i like it.<br /><br />meanwhile.&nbsp; (don't you loVe that word?)<br /><br />jaytee has been at college for what feels like forever.&nbsp; i hear he's doing well.&nbsp; AIM is not working at my house - i feel so disconnected.&nbsp; i work too much.&nbsp; i don't do enough yoga.&nbsp; and i hate the fact that its getting cold.&nbsp;<br />i love fall.&nbsp; don't get me wrong.&nbsp; seasons are why i stay in new england.&nbsp; despite the fact that come January i will be cursing the weather, the snow, the cold.&nbsp; but, i love the sweater-wearing, snow-ball making, season.&nbsp; i'm just not ready for it.&nbsp; i feel like summer was sucked away, passed by with no attention paid.&nbsp; my tan lines are barely-there.&nbsp; i miss the sun being out at 9pm.&nbsp; i love that.&nbsp; though, i am looking forward to folliage.&nbsp; i do hope to make a car ride jaunt up the kangamangus this year.&nbsp; though, i hope that nearly every year...&nbsp; and it rarely happens.&nbsp; we'll see.&nbsp; my photography skills have been slacking lately.&nbsp; lack of use.&nbsp; seasons are weird though.&nbsp; i remember being little, and having distinct clear dilineation.&nbsp; winter was cold.&nbsp; snow was enormous.&nbsp; spring was muddy.&nbsp; boots were necessary.&nbsp; and it was warm.&nbsp; the budds came out.&nbsp; summer was hott.&nbsp; iced tea and frozen juice pops were a must.&nbsp; days were long and nights were a hastle in the middle of the playtime.&nbsp; fall was cool-but fun.&nbsp; apples were abundant, so were chestnuts.&nbsp; and then winter came again.&nbsp; now...they feel like a fast blur of colors and temperatures that lead back to the beginning and we start again with the ""i cant believe its twothousandwhatever""&nbsp; time bites like that.&nbsp; i want it to slow down.&nbsp; i want to go back to the time tables kept in younger years.&nbsp; but know what i know now, and live the way i do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />ah well.&nbsp; reminiscing does the heart and soul good.&nbsp; but it will never bring back that past.&nbsp; right?<br /><br />on that note.&nbsp;&nbsp; i'm off to clean, and homework, and do whatever else comes to mind before i pass out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />enjoy tomorrow.&nbsp; wednesdays are always beloVed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />-peaCee and loVee-</font>"

"event","<font color=""#003366"">today was the basic bare epitomy of a manic monday.&nbsp; from the moment i stepped out the front door to the moment i dragged my feet out of the office..&nbsp; it was a text book day.<br /><br />going&nbsp;into the day short staffed by 2employees is never a good way to start...as it puts you behind and at a fault should anything such as an illness overtake another employee.&nbsp; but alas, this is how today would start.&nbsp; two on vacation.&nbsp; and then...the fault line crashes.<br />kellie's mom was admitted to the hospital yesterday - so she called to say she'd be late.&nbsp;&nbsp; and then there was a meeting at the hospital she had to attend at 1030.&nbsp; so she left.&nbsp; and came back just after 130.&nbsp; and at 230 her husband arrived at the window.&nbsp; i didn't speak to her but...hearsay would have it that...her mother has been given mere hours to live.&nbsp; -tear- so she left.&nbsp; firstly, my heart aches for kellie.&nbsp; her mom has been through so much, and kellie has been through so much at her bedside.&nbsp; and yes, she's on the hospice bridge program, and yes the inevitable must come someday.&nbsp; and yes, that someday would be soon...but who was to say that someday could be today.&nbsp; i feel horrible for her.&nbsp; i wish there was something i could do.&nbsp; i think i'll make a caserole or something for her family - and perhaps send some ""thinkin of you"" flowers.&nbsp; or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />ahh the helpless feeling of knowing all resources have been exhausted.<br />however, on my end of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />heres how things ""normally work""&nbsp; kellie edna and i rotate seeing patients, always 2people with each doctor -- we work them up, and are present during each patients visit...so 2days a week i see patients ""alll day"" but only 1/2 the patient load (as the other person ""on"" would see the other 1/2) and the person who is ""off"" would do any blood pressure checks, random ekgs, holters etc that don't require a doctor seeing you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />well today -- i worked up every single patient who came to the office, saw some of them..mostly the consults and the ""toughies"" and i did all the ""non-doctor visit"" people.&nbsp; as well as everything on the doctor's desks, and answered the phones a bit..since the other girl on vacation is a ""phone girl"".&nbsp; needless to say - i was at work FAR longer that i want to be..ever.&nbsp; and i am Exhausted!&nbsp; the overtime is nice though.<br />but damn..i never used my chair today - save to put some charts down, and i took a 15minute lunch, during which i was also trying to organize some of the chaos that had overtaken my desk.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />hah.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />before i sleep tonight i have to do at least one load of laundry - clean some things...perhaps make something for kellie's family.. and i most definitely need to clean my room.&nbsp; oh, its 8pm..its also time to put wyatt to bed, and maybe i should eat something??<br /><br />oh i do hope today is not an indicator of how the rest of the week will be.&nbsp; i have a HUGE paper i have to write this week, and a test on saturday.<br /><br />-gasp-<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />well..off to work myself to exhaustion.<br /><br />peaCee and loVee<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />p.s i really am not trying to whine..but damn it feels good out of my brain!</font>"

"event","<font color=""#000080"">it became apparent to me this evening as i drove home from beverly in the rainy darkness that summer is coming to a grinding screetching crash of an end.<br />no subtle change to a gentle fall - but a seemingly harsh smack across the face of the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />we went to the park today - and there are actually leaves crumpled and dried curled in little piles on the ground.&nbsp; it was cool too.&nbsp;&nbsp; we wore jeans, and sneakers, and long sleeve shirts.&nbsp; fall-esque.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />we drove to the beach, because even in the rain - its my favourite place to be.&nbsp; and went to our fav. lil place to get chicken fingers for lunch/dinner.&nbsp; and there was next to no one there.&nbsp; granted it was drizzly, and overcast.&nbsp; but to see the beach abandoned, is also...a stark reminder of the emminent end of summer.<br /><br />i feel as though nothing was accomplished.&nbsp; i didn't get to the beach enough due to inclimate weather,&nbsp;i have a rather sad looking tan, and wow..i never even went camping this summer.&nbsp; its like the entire thing just slipped by in a couple of sunnydays and raindrops..&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />just means we'll have to embrace fall and wring it for everything its worth before the dredge of winter attacks.&nbsp; i've never been a winter girl.&nbsp; i like sledding, and i'd love to be good at snowboarding, and i like snowball fights, and romantic-style walks in the snow...but being cold, and having wet feet from walking into work, and having to get up 45minutes early to shovel out the car, and getting out of work 1.5hours AFTER it gets dark...just doesn't sit well with me.&nbsp; never has, probably never will.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />cestlavie&nbsp; right?<br /><br /><br /><br />in other news..<br />spent the weekend at dana's..well, sorta.&nbsp; Friday my brother moved to college - go you jaytee!&nbsp; so i took the night off of school, and saturday i took off also...so, friday night dana stayed here and we did stupid things, looked for dishes and what not...saturday he took his bike out and we played outside...then, we headed out that way.&nbsp; we had some pizza, and went to the park..and OMG did we have fun.&nbsp; mostly we played Chase...but we did some swinging and sliding and all the good stuff.. and then walked back.&nbsp; poor lil wyatt man was exhausted!&nbsp; he walked in the apt. asked for some milk, let me change him into his pjs, laid down and went to sleep.&nbsp; -greatness-&nbsp; this morning, i went over to Shaws at like 8am to get stuff for breakfast..and i made Cinnamon French Toast, and cut up strawberries and blueberries and what not, and we had breakfast, wyatt, dana and i...and derek ate some when he rolled out of bed too.&nbsp; and then we spent the morning lolling about..until we went to this awesome park in some town that begins with a W...i forget.&nbsp;&nbsp; but it was rocking.&nbsp; then to the beach for lunch.&nbsp; and icecream for dessert...and then back to danas.&nbsp;&nbsp; dinner for wyatt, a bath, we watched GIJane, and then came home.<br />all in all - a perfect weekend.&nbsp; DAMN is it nice to have the weekend to do..whatever..instead of being trapped in a classroom.&nbsp; don't get me wrong, i love my classes...but ahh, freedom is bliss.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />newayz.<br />i think its about time i go pass out for the night.&nbsp;&nbsp; kinda a boring entry..but whatever.&nbsp; :o)<br />back to the grind tomorrow...-eep-<br /><br />peaCee and loVee<br /></font>"

i choose that line of thought.&nbsp; its best in my book.&nbsp; maybe because its the easiest wayy to be - or maybe because i'm a sucker for the fate theory.&nbsp; probably more the sucker notion.&nbsp;

and then the complex has&nbsp;a wicked nice playground that we can use, and a pool area that has both a little-kid 1 1/2foot pool, and a regular olympic sized pool.&nbsp;&nbsp; :o)<br />so now we're playing the ""get ready game"" for 2months.&nbsp; gathering things we need, like dishes and silverware, and storing as much money as humanly possible, like chipmunks gettin ready for the winter...its nice though. gives me PLENTY of time to go through things, and do that infamous cleaning out of things that one never does because there are better things to do, and it gives me another 5paychecks or so to get my savings account in a better place for rainy day emergencies.&nbsp; loVee it!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />thats enough for today i think - but know that, for the next 2months i'm sure you'll be reading my *apartment style* updates!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />peaCee and loVee</font></p>"

"event","my mind is restless tonight - my body is fidgety - and my heart is just exhausted..not the best of combinations in the world for 1030at night.  
ever get so confused by what you want in yourself that you're not sure where you're going?  i'm like that lately.  i want some things, and other things, and in all reality i'm not sure where to go - and i don't have the time, nor the correct thought process to figure it out.  i feel like days are slipping by uncontrollably, and yet..my life is standing still.  when i'm happy-i'm happy, when i'm not-its an unbelievable low - i find myself getting worried over nothing, obcessing over everything, and simply feeling out of control in my own skin.  its the worst thing in the world.  the worst.
i used to know.  to know who i was, where i was, where i wanted to go, and how i was going to get there.  now..now i find myself doubting everything.  every decision i make is agonizing, every minute i don't know is killing me, crying is an option that isn't there.  in my life - i feel alone.  and it tears me up inside.  mostly cuz my conscious knows that isnt the case.  i know that i'm not alone, and i know that i'll get some place good someday - its just going to take some time.. i know that.  but then again...  
its just the weirdest thing ever. and its starting to hurt.  
i can't concentrate on school work, or house work, or even a conversation with a friend for an extended period of time.  i get distracted.  i live my life distracted.  my brain doesn't work like it used to.  i write everything down for fear of forgetting.  thats not me - i usually remember things, photographic style even.  i used to be driven to accomplish, i'm growin more non-chalant about things each day.  loosing my passion.  
that was one of my favourite things about myself.  i could pour my heart and soul into whatever i chose, and it was always more than one thing - and get it done correctly, well, and lovingly.  now, i find myself saying ""eh, whatever"" or ""forget about it"" a lot.  i hate that.  i just, hate it.  

i wish there was something someone could say to make it better.  i've tried all the pep talks in the world.  tried every angle i can think of.  i hope someday its better, and things go back to being..normal, being the way they used to be.  
i miss being in control of me - loving my life - loving whole heartedly, not listlessly.  i want not to feel drained.. 
maybe there are just too many things in my life now.  too many important things.  
No damnit.  There are just as many important things as there always have been. 

why can't i handle it any more??"

all tucked away - into be graded by joanne.  nothing bad to say about them really.  i did some serious ass cramming last night, until far too late-and to be entirely honest, it probably wasn't all that necessary.  nonetheless i went in confident and came out the same way..  its a good thing, a good feeling.  so yay to that.
only 5more weeks of this semester.  they go by so quickly.  i have so much to do still.  a term paper, a massage therapist interview (any takers??), and a history form..  not to mention finals and of course practicums.  :o)  it'll go well though, i have the utmost confidences in myself. 
lil shout out to my girls @ McIntosh..  all of you!  i heart you muchly.
oh - and to the girls who went to Asia tonight..i wish i could have stayed and gotten blasted with ya, but i had a kicken good time - we'll have to repeat someday soon.  -muahs-

this weekend has the potential to be the best weekend i've experienced in a long time.

"event","i had one of those nights that you live for last night.  it was beautiful in its sheer simplicity.  there was no extravagant date, or a party, or anything really.  it was quiet, and simple, and i didn't want it to end.  <3
got out of work at 6, came home and threw a bunch of things in the car.. and then wyatt and i drove down to beverly.  this in and of itself was an adventure.  97, which someone told me was open and clear between here and beverly, was not.  so i detoured back by baldpate, got slightly lost, and did manage my way back 133, and onto 95.  the long way to beverly, might i add.  so, finally arriving at danas, we went to the ""local"" wendys to get chicken cesar salads..my favourite! and back to his house to eat, and watch stupid tv in anticipation of the CSI finale at 9.  around 845 derek johnson came over, blast from the past, it was good to see him.  the bois played darts, wyatt and i hung round and had good conversation with the bois.  it was good.  CSI was on, and it was such a damn good episode-i love that show like woah.  good old fashioned hangin out with friends is always good for the soul.  'round 11, derek went home - and dana and i went to bed.  watching stupid clips on the computer and just laughing til about 1, and then it was passing out from exhaustion, holding each other.  <3 my favourite <3
this morning-dana had to work.  so, he got up early and went off as usual - me, i stayed behind, passed out until like 8am when wyatt got up.  ahh, it was soo good to sleep.  then, i cleaned dana's room up, made his bed, emptied his dishwasher, and cleaned up the living room.  and came back to my house.  
last night was nothing of grave importance - but it was such a good thing.  laughter, pure and simple, jokes, hanging out with friends.  i loved every second of it. i hope it happens again soon.  :o)

and that leads to tonight.  a night like any other to a college kid.  tied to text books, cramming for mid-terms, living off of diet coke and the occasional rummage through myspace.com to break the monotony that is studying.  
wyatts sleeping peacefully.  my parents are out on a movie date together.  my sister is off with her boyfriend.  and jt is at the movies with friends.  dana is off hanging out with his friends at the pit.  and i'm home, doing homework and intermittently attempting to clean some of the house.  this seems to be the theme to my friday nights.  i like them.  they give me time to think, to be entirely alone in the house, no one to interrupt my thoughts.  its good every now and then.  to have some soul time.  especially after a night where you get to laugh with others.  

ah well.  back to hitting the books soon.

dana and i have been doing well.  i'm not sure what we are - and to be honest, the title simply isn't important right now to me.  he makes me laugh, i make him smile, we love each other - no, we don't know when things will change, or if they ever will.  can we honestly say ""i'll be with you til the end"" sometimes yes, sometimes its more of a ""i think this would be good"" we both have a lot of growing up to do, a lot of soul searching, maturing, and life living to do before we're really ready.  but i do have the faintest idea that we will do our growing together, and our living together, and eventually it just doesn't make sense for us to be any place other than, together.  <3 and thats all good with me."

i have never been happier to get a letter from college in the mail than saturday - when i got my ""you made the Deans List"" letter.  :o)



things have been alrightish lately. 
wicked busy - with work, and school being back in full swing, and wyatt is gettin crazy..especially now that we get to play outside.   oh, do i love playin outside with him..its so, great.  it tires ya out like nothin though.. hahaha.. and then, there have been the stupid doctors appointments. -gah-  i've been to the doctors 3times in the last month, and for me..thats enourmous.  its gettin annoying - i just want to get to the bottom of whats goin on.  oh well, soon enough.. i just wish i wasn't so god damn tired all the time.  
other than all of that..i'm doin okay - dana and i have been talkin a couple times a week on the phone, and usually every-other day via IM messages left for each other or whatev.  its making it difficult to move on, but - its okay.  i'm not in the mood to move on and date anyways, i'm okay just..being alone for now.  and besides, loosing him as my bf hurts enough-loosing his friendship too would probably kill me.  well, not literally but..ya know.  so, we're gettin along alright.  who knows what will happen.  its weird - there is still that element of caring behind our conversations - and i'm sure it will never go away.. but it makes it, so, comfortable. safe.  he's still the first name i think of when i'm down, or when somethin good happens..i just want to share it with him. and he's the same..   ah well, just ride the waves and go with the flow - right?  

i realized this entry is soundin whiney. 

i don't mean it like that at all.  things are just heavy in my life right now.  the whole single-mom-super-hero thing is startin to weigh on me.  not that i really think i'm a super-hero.. but damnit, it feels like it sometimes..  eh, i dunno.

maybe its gettin near time for a lil vacation.  <33

"event","after miles of circles have been run, and thousands of rehersals of our end, though i will never be entirely sure that our goodbye means goodbye for good, and i'll not know until it happens whether i'll answer the phone should you call.  but for now, in this moment, i think the circles have ceased-the lines of worry formed by the same question have been dug to their finality.  or at least, i think so.
i always thought our end, should it come (and we all know it has been coming slowly and painfully for sometime now) would be bittersweet.  a tear, a kiss, and a goodbye.  painstakingly beautiful.  instead, it was abrupt, and to the point.  a very simple over-bearingly hurt heart which blurted the words, ""whatever, when you're ready..if you're ready, you know where i am, until then i'm done.  so very fucking done"" and a click of the reciever.  
72hours have past..and we haven't spoken.  sure i got an email-and an im. but, i was strong and brave.  i didn't respond.  i didn't initiate.  nor do i plan to.  damnit, i'll do anything not to.  
i love you til death. simple and beautiful.  i will remember the good, and not the bad..or at least, i'll try to.  you captivated my the day we met, back in the JCs days, and you had me since.  but i can't do it any more.  you know that.  i just..can't.  the heart can only break so many times.  the wounds can only heal so often, until they become permanant tears.  forever there.  scars to remind us.  salt may as well have been constantly pouring over stab wounds.  now, its raw..and calloused around the edges.  someday, when the scars are white and shiney, and the feelings buried beneath the rubble of years - maybe rekindling will be our future.  heck, it happened once already.  but i can't live looking for the future anymore.  i can't live on the hope-string of our maybes and our could-bes.  i just--can't.
its not gonna be easy.  not writing or calling has already been a ridiculously hard thing for me to do.  but damnit, i have to.  so please-if you care to call, do.  but don't be hurt if i don't answer, and don't be mad if i don't call back.  just understand that time is a necessary component to unremembering you.  time. 

thank goodness its april now.  the sun is out.  the flowers are poking through the ground.  there are so many positives in this world right now.  thank heavens for small blessings and beautiful timing.  
we're gettin ready for so many things right now.  Easter. The Boston Marathon.  Spring.  JTs Graduation from HHS.  Wyatts 2nd birthday.  My dads 50th.  granted, many of those things are distant happenings.  but theyre positive.  and theyre something to look forward to.   

to anyone else who reads this.  i do appologize that many of my entries are contradictory - but thats how my life runs.  i know i quite often write bout breakups and reunions.  but that is the vicious cycle i have been living for..quite some time now.  any smarter person would have jumped ship months back.  but i, am hopelessly romantic, and i cling endlessly to the things i love.  i recently ran across some of my philiosophical style quotes i had bundled up in a notebook and one struck me stunningly.

Hold onto your dreams tight enough and you'll squash them - Hold onto anything tight enough and you'll kill it.

so perfect.  i can't hold on anymore. i can't cling listlessly to love.  i've chosen instead, to let it go.  set it free, and see what comes of it.  should it disappear and be gone forever, so be it.  should it come back someday blooming and golden, embrace it - but don't hold it, nurture it - but don't coddle.  

enough jibberjabber.

this week brings a lot of things.  i'm rather excited for them all.
Monday-Thursday brings the normal work with, minus one luck employee who is on vacation. should be frantically amusing.  
Friday - good friday.  some time will be spent with the family.  and shopping-gonna have to shop for school supplies etc.  
Saturday - my first day of Second Semester.  the roster?  MT A&P Lab 2, MT1 lecture and MT1 lab.  i'm rather excited for the actual MT classes to start.  damnit its gonna be fun!
Sunday - Easter.  there will of course be church going, and easter egg hunting, and then dinner with the family at The Hungry Traveler.  this in itself is bittersweet.  
Traditionally-Easter is hosted by my dad's parents.  After his father passed on, his mom started taking the whole family out to the hungry traveler.  its been this way every year since i was 17.  (i know, its only 4years-that is not the point) this year however, my dad's mom has passed on.  so, my dad will be takin us this year, and a void will be at the table.  in addition-there will be a seat set for a certain someone whom i am not speaking to at the moment, and that in itself will most certainly pull at my heartstrings for a period of time.  but, wyatts excitement i am sure will glisten.  <33
Monday - a holiday.  no work! and, Dad is running his SECOND Boston Marathon.  So everyone, keep an eye out for my dad, and keep him in your thoughts as you spend your day off, think of the hundreds of thousands of runners out there...skidding across the pavement for 26.2miles.  :o)

yea, it should be a good week.  hopefully each day will be better than the last, and at the very least - this gloomy weekend will be *in the past* just a simple memory..."

"event","i used to sit at the computer in my UNE dorm room just itching to update.  now, i run around cleaning up toys and cups and whatever else has fallen to the floor throughout the day, and clammour into my bed before the idea to update even trapses through my brain.  my heart is itching for a letdown, for a release, my soul is aching for drainage of my baggage, of all the ridiculous thoughts that run through my life each day.  
ever feel like you're just running in circles?  physically my life is moving forwards, i have physical proof of growth.  a semester down at school.  papers, written and printed long ago, ink dried and starting to fade.  pictures post dated, paychecks cashed and spent.  the calandar changes.  personal growth on most levels in pretty obvious.  
and then there is the emotional loving part of my soul that keeps running in circles.  never getting anywhere, moving away and then finding itself right back where it started.  i'm making a rut.  a dent in the world around me that i'm finding it impossible to fight my way out of.  i simply don't know what to do.  
i love him with my heart and soul.  my body aches when i'm near him.  butterflies still race through my veins when we kiss.  but, if you had to look through an objective lens, you'd say...its never going to happen, its never going to work.  which i kno, describes every great love story ever written.  but it also describes a great deal of heartache and lonely elderly people who never could muster the courage to move on in their lives.  you can't say i love you, and mean it, and not want to be with someone - or can you?  can you, after soo many years, simply be unsure of what you want to become of a relationship?  or are you simply unsure - because you know that it shouldn't be, but you're afraid to move on, afraid to leave, unwilling to give up on something you truly love?  i don't kno..  its why i keep runnin the same track over and over again.  
""we'll work on it""   ""forget it""  ""we'll be friends""  ""we'll date""  ""i love you""  ""we can't be friends, we can't talk, it wont work""  ""i can't do it without you""  ""i wanna be with you""  
its enough to want to scream.  yell.  throw a fit.  just get it out.  
so many words, and thoughts, pulsing through your veins.  you don't know what to do.  
passion of a strong love mixing with the disappointment of uncertainty confusing you to the point of not caring anymore.  
damnit. 
god damnit.  
i wanna be cold.  i wanna not care.  i can't do it though.  i'm not built like that.  not programmed to be the uncaring stony girl.  i'm always going to fall for it, talk myself into moving on, and then hearing your voice...turn back.  i always will.  i can't say no to you.  i'm not built to do it.  its so damn dumb.
i've always been like that. 
i'll always give anyone the benefit of the doubt.  chances are nearly endless with me.  when you say you're sorry-i'll believe you.  maybe thats what people like about me, i'm overly accepting of human flaws, even when they happen over and over again to the point of hurting..i'll still accept them, and deal.  
i'd love to get some stony in me.  i'd love to get some cold.  some fuck you in my veins.  some, you're not worth it, some you can work for it..
gah.  i annoy myself sometimes. 

love is an amazing emotion.  don't get me wrong. 
i really don't think i'm all that bad. 
and i'm always going to love you.  and its not a bad thing. 
but damnit. i want some sort of certainty.  i want, something..

i wanna be that girl.  the girl you don't want to be away from.  the girl you want to call just to say hi during work.  the girl you want your friends to meet.  the girl you don't want to live with out.  i wanna be the girl. 

will it ever happen with you? i don't know.  i'm starting to doubt it."

windows barred shut 
no sunlight let in 
no darkness let out 
how much can we change 
in just a few months 

 i have never in my life wanted something to be wrong.  but now, as i count down the days til the doctors appointment i have the end of the month, i'm hoping that she'll find something wrong.  why?  because if there is something wrong-then there is a reason for me to feel the way i do.  if nothing is wrong, then there is no explanation and that in itself is unsettling.  i've just..not been myself lately.  tired all the time, kind of emotional for the wrong reasons, having headaches everyday, not to mention all the other stuff that i don't feel like talking about.  the simple idea in itself that i want to go to bed at 830 at night is a ridiculous change of pace from my normal me.  i'm usually a stay up til 1am, and get up whenever girl.  not stay up til 830, sleep, and then wake up still tired..  i don't get it.  i'm discouraged.  but, my doctors appointment is in a mere 20days.  though i hope nothing bad is going on, i hope there is a reason for me to feel the way i do.

 dana and i are good-we're being friendly..and dating here and there.  i'm enjoying our time together more.  and more.  which is lovely.
 i went to see Anna Nalick with justin on sunday at the paradise.  it was simply a fabulous night.  a *save this memory* type of night.

 well, i'm exhausted (and its all of 9pm) i think i'll get some sleep.."

"event","wyatts watchin monsters inc.  i'm workin on homework-and takin a lil break from my a&p homework.  i hate the fact that i'm retaking the lab for that class.  its wayy different than the first one i took but still...
in anycase.
things are alright.  everything has changed since my last entry.  
dana and i broke up.  we still hang out about once-a-week, and talk everyday on the phone.  and we're talking about a possible date in coming weeks. but, i'm not puttin any eggs in a basket.  just takin things as they come.  we're young-we've got plenty of time.  and besides-between my new work schedule and my school, i was startin to feel bad that i was turning down every ""wanna go out this weekend?"" he threw my way.  take some time to just be me and wyatt, focus on school-and throwin money in the bank-and if we get to hang out, cool, if not-then its not meant to be.  simple as that, well-at least on paper its simple like that.  
work is..incredibly busy.  the new way we see patients takes a toll on your day, and my new 10hours shifts are rough.  but they totally pay off when i have fridays free to spend with wyatt instead of working.  its probably the best thing ever.  and someday-when i'm done school-i'll have 3day weekends, and that will be fabulous. :o) can't wait.  
i got two turtles on wednesday.  they're 6months old, and approximately the size of a large watch face.  they're sooo damn cute.  i named them Spike and Belle.  they live in tank on my dresser.  and i love them.  wyatt thinks they're pretty cool too..he always points to the tank and says ""hi tutu""  super cute!

school is honestly going fabulously.  one of my first classes has already ended.  i got a 105 on my final..giving me a 4.0 for now.  yay me!  haha..i kno, its only one class...but still, i'm proud of me.  if i keep going the way i think i am-i'll be incredibly happy with myself.  incredibly.  i love my classes this term, and shelley (teacher) is amazing.  it helps that we have her for all the classes this term.  -whee-  its going by fast though.  our finals are march 18th (i think)  eep!  i'm also really loving what i'm learning  so that helps immensly.  a nice change of pace from the necc/nursing/crap classes.  nursing school will come someday-but, today is not the day.  :o)  i should get back to that homework waiting for me though...
aiight-back to my fabulous movie and homework.

"event","things are changing - very quickly.

we went to disney world.  mom, dad, grams, me, dana, wyatt, amanda and jt.  had a wonderful time. dad ran a marathon in 537.  go him!
the trip was fabulous.  coming home was terrible.

got into work 815am-thursday.  boss was there, asked to talk to me.  they changed my job all around.  now, i'm going to see patients, and be medical-assistant, instead of medical-secretary.  fine by me.  i have the skills.  possibility of 6hours spent in billing department also.  thats huge-possibility of a pay raise? maybe.  i could really use a few extra dollars for my hours.  
school starts tomorrow - 830am.  i'm excited.  actually, i can't wait.  i have an idea i'm going to love mcintosh-and i'm going to love the new major.  *massage therapy*  any takers?

dana and i are doing well.  we had a rocky time before florida.  but, florida was good for us.  i think we're tighter now.  we love each other dearly.  we make each other laugh.  things might not be perfect, but i don't want perfect - i want love.  <3

i'm incredibly tired..and i have to get up wicked early tomorrow for school.  ugh-i wish i was a morning person more than i was a night person.  ah well.  
off i go..

excited for my changes, and my new direction.  here i go, flowing with the tides.

"event","sometimes life gets hectic and you want to step back..take time for yourself.  sometimes my brain gets too full, and i feel like i'm going to melt down.  and i'm sure everyone feels this way sometimes.  i know everyone does.  i just wish i handled it better.  transitions aren't always the easiest things in the world, and the worst part is..they can take, as long as they need to.  thats where i am now.  i'm in a transition.  between hyped out college kid and grown up.  i'm working on changing my life in a million different ways at once.  it almost seems like too much, and yet, all the changes go hand in hand.  dropping out of school, getting a full time job, changing my outlook on the world, thinking of moving out of my house, re-evaluating my relationships, and re-evaluating my lifegoals in general.  i'm such a different person than i was 2years ago at this time.  2years ago i was making a huge change too, i was leaving UNE forever, i was coming home, i was gonna be a mom.  now, i am a mom-a single mom, who works really hard, studies her ass off, and isn't happy with any of it.  i want to be a single mom, who loves being a mom (cuz i do) who works, and comes home to be with her son.  who loves her life, and her job.  its weird, the medical field...as in, being a doctor/physician assistant has always appealed to me..its been my dream forever.  and now, i'm not so sure.  is that where i belong?  i've found such a love in other areas of my life...i'm so wanting to gravitate toward them.  to embrace them, and make them a part of every aspect of my life.  i have no idea.  i'm babbling.  but i do know that big big changes are coming in my life.  and i'm okay with it.  its just the tumultous class five rapids that are kicking my ass right now.  i've been neglecting the basics for so long and focusing on the big picture.  i need to step back inside the pixels and focus them first.  forget where i'm going to be in 10years, or 5years, or 2years.  focus on today. on the task at hand. focus on making me happy, and being a good mom, and a good friend.  thats what i really need to do.  find your bliss.  anyone feel like going searching with me? it might be a long road..but i'm sure we'll laugh along the way.  i'm positive.  
ever want to run until you throw up, and then keep going til you can't go any more..then turn around to head home.  thats how i feel sometimes.  like i just need to get something out of me.  i don't know what it is.  sometimes i just want to...i don't know.  do something different.  play by different rules.  be something else.  i guess thats where i am right now.  redefining. 

randomness. 

i put snowflakes up in my room today (thanks to jt for reaching the ceilling) they're awesome.  and festive.  i need to buy new lights for my walls.  i love christmas lights.  i tend to leave them up all year long..the white ones have a romantic glow to them.  gorgeous.  
one month from today we go to disney world.  i'm excited.  i can't wait to see wyatt's reactions to the parks, sights, everything.  i can't wait.  that will be so much fun.  
i want to go to boston for new years eve.  i'm hoping that will finally happen. i've always wanted to go to first night.  always.  hopefully this year, i'll get to add it to my, been there - loved it, things.  

i'm done rambling, i think i'm going to go pick up random things and crawl between my sheets."

"event","things have been just, different, around here lately.
i'm not loving where i live. which is why i'm extremely excited that..i'm in my last semester of school for a while.  i'm taking some time away from school and starting full time in january (hopefully) it'll be a nice change of pace.  then i can focus on being a mom more than anything in the world. which is what i want to do. 
plus, i really really want to move out-get a space of my own. a little two-bed room apartment on the second floor of some run-down apartment building.  who cares where, or how. just that i'll have it, and it will be mine. a place that me and wyatt can call home - our home.  <3 i can't wait. 
so. recently i reconnected with a long lost friend.  funny to say that at 21years old. but its the truth. 
i was friends with brian in middle school.  matter of fact, we were very good friends.  i set him up with his first girlfriend and everything.  so, on tuesday november 15th we went out to dinner.  he was home from Iraq, yeah he's a marine, for 2weeks.  and we basically spent the next 2 weeks together.  we had a ton of fun, replaying old memories, and making new ones.  i had sorta forgotten just how cool of a kid he is.  the night before he left, i even met his mom.  *weird*  a guy who'll introduce you to his rents, within a couple weeks.  hehehe.  newayz.  so, he left november 29th...he's back in Iraq for a couple more months.  i'm wishing him well, and praying for safe return everyday.  i hope anyone who reads this will do the same.  
so..heres to you brian. not everyone agrees with the war-and thats cool. but we'll always be grateful people like you exist.  <3 
not to mention the fact that i think you're awesome.  *come home safe*

lets see.. what else is going on..well, a whole lotta nothing really.  just gettin by day by day..slowly.  

blahh i'm tired  i think i'm gonna get some sleep.  *sweet dreams*

"event","so, my little bug is home-and in my possession-and beautiful. 
poor thing though. having to be driven, er..sputtered, around by me all day long.  standard driving, though i get the basics, is not coming naturally to me. though, i did make it all the way to NECCO and home today..with only stalling once, on a hill! whee. 
ah well.
so, yes. my bettle is beautiful. blue. sunroof. all the essentials i.e. wheels, seats, a trunk, a rather alright-speaker-system.  
perhaps you'll see her sometime. 

otherwise.
i joined GoldsGym. and i love going. saturday morning i met with heather, a trainer, cuz its free for 2times, and we had a good time. i learned a lot. afterwards, i went for a 20minute elyptical journey. then dana picked me up. 
sunday i went again. wyatt played in play-care. he LOVES going there!! and HATES leaving there!! which, is a good thing. so i spent an hour or so getting myself buff. hehehe. elyptical. resistance. crunches. bike. home. it was good. 
i meet heather again on wednesday night-and then i'm going to get some actually *personal training* from her, with her pushing my ass to do things. 
its very very nice. 
i love going to the gym. 
beth and i used to go periodically at UNE. and it was good. and when she was gone, and i was bored, i used to go. i forgot how much i liked it.

ah..well.
wyatts nap is done!  :o)

"event","tonight i drove standard for the very first time in my life. 
it was horrible.
not only did the car shake, sputter, and stall countless times. but, my father - who was trying to teach me - was completely and totally stressed out by the entire thing. not helpfull at all.
i better figure it out soon.
since i'm buying a standard once i get the insurance check on my jetta.

yep. you heard. a standard. 

watch out if you get behind a girl. driving a blue car. with massachusetts plates. on a hill.  stay back.  very very far back.  :o)

dana comes home tomorrow! whee. 5pm. i can not wait. we shall spend saturday evening at my house. and he has promised to take me out on sunday-and not only let me drive his car, around a parking lot, but also to teach me the ligistics of how a clutch works, what it does, and why its important. 
dana understands my brain.
he knows that i can't do something unless i understand why it must be done. i'm very logical in some aspects of my thought process. i've been told it is the quality about me that will someday make me a good medical person(i.e. a doctor if i ever get there..hahah..funny) anyways. he will draw out in great detail what this whole clutch thing is about. i will ask him a million questions. and he will answer them. and when all is said and done. 
hopefully.
i will be able to drive standard.

wish me luck. cross your fingers for dana's car! :o)

when i have everything finalized and my car is in my possession i will reveal what it is. excited? you should be! hehehe.

sweet dreams.

"event","been a very long time. soo much has happened. 
the biggest thing is that i got into a huge car accident with my jetta and it was totalled.  its a sad thing-but at least i'm okay-and wyatt wasn't in the car. and the accident wasn't my fault, so thats good too.  
right now, i'm driving a rental. its not so bad, but i would't pick the car out for myself in...a million years. i did find a car that i want. i'm pretty sure i'll get it. and i'm excited about it. but, i don't want to jinx myself, so i'll say no more about that.  :o)

dana's birthday was a few days ago. we had a good time celebrating it. him and his brother are born a day apart from each other, so they had a big joint party at the pit. it was a good time, though i was kinda freaked about driving at night. i'm still having issues from the accident. but i don't want to talk about that. blah blah blah. the party was a good time. saturday we went car shopping, and then i went to his house for the night.  i took him out to dinner, and then we spent a quiet night together. it was romantic, and fun. and i loved every moment of it. finally-on sunday, his actual birthday-i drove him to the airport early early early in the morning.  i do hope he had a good birthday. <3
so, right now..dana is in virginia beach living it up on the executive floor of a hotel that has 2pools (yeah, 2..c'mon now!), a hot tub, and a bar *on the ROOF* how killer is that??  i'm jealous.  he's sent me some pretty sweet pics though.  

speaking of pics. photography class is going really well. i'm having so much fun, and learning a ton. i'm a little behind on my rolls. and a little behind developing since i had to miss a class cuz of being all sore and what not. but, i can catch myself up. i'm hoping to have some really good prints though. hopefully some really good ones of wyatt. especially since they're all black and white. oh do i love black and white photos.  :o)  
happy girl.

i think i'm done rambling. and my pain killers are kicking in. yeah, i still need pain killers to sleep at night..my accident was 2weeks ago tomorrow. my poor wrist tendons.  maybe tomorrow i'll write the account of the accident. maybe not.  :o)

ahh well.  latah dayz!

"event","so here we are. another monday. ewww. i think everyone should have the summers completely off. like we did when we were in school-and irresponsible, so we didn't have jobs or anything. we just chilled. hung with friends. slept til whenever. monday, tuesday, saturday..it didn't matter-and most of the time, we didn't know what day it was. it was just fun. i miss that. 
oh well.
i guess on the up-side...now, weekends are a highly coveted event! :o) and this weekend was pretty good. friday night dana and i went to a party at dan's. always a good time. always. saturday i had a stats meeting-which was a complete and total waste of time. followed by an afternoon of nothingness. we went to OldNavy again (i'm addicted) and to Boarders...yay chakra book! and then we hung out. we were gonna go to hilary's but she was feeling icky. so we just did..well..nothing. i wanted to see beth on sunday-but i was lazy..so me and wyatt just kinda hung around all day, we played in the back yard etc. nothing too exciting. but still..it was a good weekend.
as of tonight all my classes will have started. they're all pretty cool so far. 
my yoga teacher is a hippie. and that class is just going to be good for my soul.
my english teacher is a slightly different version of a hippie. and that class is going to be good for my conversational analysis skills, as well as for my writing skills.
my statistics teacher talks way too fast, and way to much. but that class is online, so it really doesn't matter. it will be a challenge though. muchly.
and tonight..i will explore my photo class. hopefully he will be an artsy-dorky guy like my painting teacher was at UNE...i loved that class :o)

well..wyatt is sleeping. and i'm in need of doing laundry. 
so i'm off.. till next time!

"event","this weekend was very good. and long so thats a super-plus.  friday night was spent at dana's house. he made a candle-lit dinner for three, chicken broccoli and potatoes, some wine, and icecream for dessert. very romantic. wyatt had a wicked good time. saturday we went out to breakfast-yummi-and then wyatt and i headed home. we went out to dinner with some extended family members, and had a quiet night here. sunday was spent erranding. eww. film to be developed, school supplies to buy, and the normal house-hold errandy stuff. yuck. but, on the bright side-we finished everything. sunday night dana came here. we did absolutely nothing. and then today-yay for having monday's off-we went to the beach, and the mall. :o) its gonna suck going back to work tomorrow.
work is so...tumultous lately. there's just so much rough water to wade through.. just so you can get your job done. its a pain really. a huge pain. 
you see-katie, the boss. is leaving. gone as of..thursdayish? she's doin her rotations for her masters (nurse practicioner) and the *big guys* have known of this forever. but they waited..forever to replace her. finally sorta made a move and chose a new manager-and she said ""no"". so-way to go. no boss. :o) sorta. unfortunately on top of this change in managerial personel (which really is of no matter to me. all i do is say g'morning to them.) we're having enormous issues with a single employee. simply being a bitch. not pulling her weight, causing more work for others, and generally bringing down the morale of the office staff. she's hurtfull with the things she says, and the way she acts. and despite numerous complaints to our present manager-not a word has been said to the employee. its rather annoying. but sooner or later..i think something big will happen. she's hard to approach. she is automatically defensive, and hostile. its just who she is. but its annoying as all hell to work with.  for example...friday-me, and two other people worked, and thats it. and one of them was ""problem employee"" (PE for short) and damnit it was busy as could be cuz of the impending holiday-weekend. i almost lost it a couple times. phones ringing off the hook, doctors calling, messages pilling up, people walking in off the street, and PE sitting there ""i have to confirm my patients. i need to read my charts. i can NOT answer this god damn phone""  fuck you!!!!  -ewww- 
alright. enough work bitching. i just hope tomorrow doesn't suck hardcore. -please-

classes start wednesday. my schedule is pretty cakey.
english mwf mornings
photo mon nights
yoga thurs nights
stats online  
should be good. i'm looking forward to it..for the most part.  gives me plenty of hours i can work, and a couple afternoons to spend with wyatt :o) yay!

"event","this weekend has been a whirlwind of amazing events. absolutely fun. one hundred precent. 
friday night wyatt and i went to dana's for the evening. we went to salem willows for dinner, chicken fingers of course, and we hung out til late watching the sun set over the bay and watching the darkness set in. wyatt had a great time running around in the grass and playing with dana and i. stayed out wayy late for wyatt. but he was sleeping peacefully by 930. i know, sounds wicked late, right? whatev. back at dana's we kicked back and watched our beloved spongebob. and started to watch constantine, but decided it was going to require too much thought, so we reverted back to our cartoons and curled up for a good night sleep. in the morning, i made pancakes and hashbrowns for my bois and we had a lovely breakfast. after our morning nap, we packed it up and headed back to my house. where we chilled, and ate dinner, and i spent like 2hours trying on outfits to go out for the night. yeah..my floor is littered with jeans i chose not to wear, and shoes. i'm a dork. and its okay. when the outfit was decided upon, and wyatt was tucked snuggly into his bed, dana and i jetted. to dan's for a house-warming party. -whee- it was a killer time. tons of people. lots of beerpong and flip-cup. gooood times. i'd never played flip cup before..but its fun. its soo good to get out-and just be a 21year-old every once in a while. to know that, for five-hours, you can just be yourself, let your hair down, and party. its..liberating. and it causes major headaches for your sunday. but its so worth it. just cuz it doesn't happen very often. it was also good to hang out with dana's friends...who cross over into some of my old high-school friends. so its cool to see them..and have the conversation be normal. and fun. alright, you get it, it was a kickin party. it was actually a completely kickin night. all the way home. and when dana helped me walk up the stairs, and tucked me into bed. and thank god, wyatt must have known our plans...cuz he slept til 915 this morning. -thank you- :o) so when we finally got up this morning..it wasn't a pretty picture. but at least we were moving. today was spent kicking around the house in our pjs til like 1250..when wyatt finally went down for a nap and i got to shower. oh god, do i love showers. then we drove dana home and came back for an afternoon of completely wyatt-mommi time. absolutely no one else home. it was..awesome. much needed alone time for us. goood times. its weird. often i think that weekends like this, when i let myself go..and have a good time. are sort of irresponsible. and maybe it sounds that way. but-i always have a sitter for wyatt. and i'm always responsible. i don't drive when i party, and i don't party without best-friends present. so..dont judge that. cuz really-every once in a while..everyone needs to let themselves free. let themselves have a really-really good time. 
so that was my liberatingly fuzzy weekend. it was an amazing whirlwind of fun. and laughter. of friends. of family. of perfection. and i loved every second of it. <3

on a different note.

~we're going to disney world!~
and we really are too! my dad is running a marathon down there. so, my family (me, wyatt, mom and dad, grammie jean, jt..and hopefully dana) is going down for a week in january. i'm soo excited to take wyatt!!  i know..he's only going to be 18 months old. and he wont remember it. but, i know he'll have a good time while he's there. i know it! and i can't wait! can't wait! i feel like a little kid. i get more excited about things like this now. its like christmas, i woke up soo early cuz i couldn't wait to see wyatt's reaction to everything. everything is good. :o)

alright.i need to de-litter my floor of jeans. and make a list of stuff i need for school. -ewww- school shopping awaits. -ewww- only a few more days of freedom. september 7th will be here veryy soon! but, my classes look to be promising..
English Composition 2
Statistics (online course)
Introduction to photography
Yoga 1
its going to a good semester. and hopefully a high gpa semester! :o) thats my goal. although, deans list should always be a goal.

"event","last night was to be an event. a night on the town for dana and i. we were to go out to dinner, or to a bar, or to a club. or something. perhaps travel the roads to boston. we had the night to ourselves. free and breathless. beauty in itself doesn't get better. so what do we do? we clean ourselves nicely. and look all beautiful. pack ourselves into my lovely vw. and we pick up an extra-cheese pineapple pizza from prinzis, sit around eating it and laughing for hours while watching spongebob on the couch. and then pass out around 10. :o) and it was beautiful. at midnight we sleepily wandered into his bedroom, watched the fishies swimming happily with the turtle for a little while, and drifted back to sleep until thunder and lightning woke us this morning. no, it wasn't a night on the town where we wandered in tired, sweaty, and drunk at 4am. but it was beautiful. we have that ability together. to take anything we do, and make it worth talking about. make it beautiful. 
i guess they weren't kidding when they said *beauty is in the eye of the beholder* because i imagine there are people sitting at their glowing computer screen, reading my words of dribble cuz they have nothing better to do. hey, i know i do it when i'm bored. saying *thats the most boring night, ever, LAME* but no. it was beautiful to us. 
i find beauty in showers, and in laughter. lots of beauty. love. :o)
i hope that we will always have this quality. to find beauty in our actions. always. we seem to always have. i can remember a night, years ago (literally) when we were working at the icecream stand, and it was pouring out-thunder and lightning-and it was a bit on the chilly side. our exit was flooded. and we played in the rain. despite having to clean up our muddy foot prints. despite being stuck at work on a horrid evening. we had an amazing time. we made sandwiches with the boss. and let her go home for the night. we stayed. for the few customers we had. we made boats to float in our flooded exit. and we had a grande beautiful time. <3 
our first dates didn't include anything costly. we watched fireworks from the middle of the road. we would sit on the beach, near our staircase for hours just talking. we would drive for hours, just cuz we could. we would sit on the floor of my living room, in the dark, watching jaws-movies at 2am, and laugh. and he'd drive home-far too late, climb in his window so to avoid the rath of his step-dad. 

i hope there is always beauty. always."

"event","changes are brewing. i'm not sure why. but its time for a change. for a new ray of light to shine in my life. cuz everyday's the same. i don't like it that way. i can't handle when i look at my life and see reflections of days gone by in the future light. so as the winds of a storm will shift on a dime, the winds of my life should.  instead, they'll be hesitant, and i'll be cautious. and one day i'll arrive in an entirely new place. i'll look around refreshed, awake, revived, and think fondly of the life i left and eagerly of the life i'm living and not of the life ahead-cuz the future matters not when you enjoy your present.  <3

my present now though..well
*took my micro finals today. lots of work. my brain is has been mushed up and chewed. its rolling around in my head, facts dripping instead of being sorted and stored. tomorrow i'll store them. tomorrow. 
*work is cruddy. i'm tired of people whining. whining about the work they have to do. about the employee number. and, well anything they can whine about. and i say-if you hate it.leave it. you know? whatever. its not worth the time it takes to think about it.
*my skin is peeling. and my legs are still burnt from vacation. but damn do i have a nice tan. so worth it. yay. i loved my vacation-every single second of it. i want to go again. i've never had a better vacation in my life. honestly. dana and i had a truly amazing time. we made memories upon memories and had laughs upon laughs. our 7hour canoe ride on sunday was the best time i've ever spent. <3 love. 
*wyatt is doing amazingly. his little brain is so amazing. he likes to hide in the closet and play. peek-a-boo is fun. he's a very good dancer. his chinese is beautiful. and his kisses are precious. until teeth are involved. then they suck. his hair has curls. his stomp-stomp-dance is the funniest thing you'll ever see. i can't believe he'll be 14months old soon.
so that is my present. my life. *these words are my diary screaming outloud and i know you'll use them however you want to*
and now. i must sleep. for in your sleep. you regain consciouness only experienced in infantile-amnesia, and sleep. <3

"event","in the fleeting moments of day.  when dusk is upon us but we're not ready to surrender to the nights calm.  in those few brief moments, when children hush their play and the stars come out to dance..i like to think. to reflect upon the day, the weeks, the years.  its sentimental and corney.  but its mine.  all mine.
buttefly kisses have come i droves this week.  -love- peaceful and perfect.  
funny. i never thought i'd be where i am. not in a million years. never thought the most abrupt change of my life would be the best thing to have happened to me. but it is. and it always will be. <3
sometimes dreams are just that, they're dreams. nothing more nothing less. the visions you have of yourself years from now. don't always come true. but change is never a bad thing. change teaches you to be stronger, to stand in a different light, to dance to a different tune. change is thrown at us from the starlets of fate, and then they sit back and see where we take the dance.  do we embrace the new music, make up our own steps, and flourish in the limelight? or do we shy away from the change becoming a fixture im the background, collecting dust like a relic desperately trying to escape into the comfort of the past? or do we fight the change with a fierce vengence that sends us into a tailspin we can't pull ourselves out of? its those choices that we have. those choices that we make. that are the true test of our character. of strength, or weakness.  keep dreaming. dreams keep us going. but know that sometimes your wildest dreams come true, and sometimes your most wanted dreams become nightmares, and your nightmares become dreams.  
we watched a movie last night. 40daysand40nights. a movie we've watched before. dana fell quietly asleep early on. but i stayed awake, curled in his arms to watch the movie.  the idea of the movie-a sex ridden movie really-is beautiful if you ask me. to give up something that you love, that you're obcessed with, for any amount of time, in order to free yourself from it. is such simplistic, genious idea.  what empowerment comes from conquering something that your life is about.  so, most people aren't completely controlled by sex, or food, or whatever. but i think we should all do things like that.  to deprieve our bodies of something we love.  not for a religious reason. not only during lent.  but whenever we need a change of tunes. whenever we need our own starlet intervention.  i plan to give something up. soon. what i don't know, i need to think of it tonight.  but tomorrow-being August 1st, is a perfect time.  i'm enticed. what can i say?

ah. my application is finished printing. i'm off. to fill out my life's story onto a piece of paper in hopes of furthering my academic career.

"event","memories flooding back through my walls are piercing my brain and stabbing my soul.  thoughts i never wished to think have been evoked.  a dark veil placed long ago has been lifted off of hidden chapters in my life.  despite it all, the flashes of long off times and images of hidden dreams and secrets, i feel no different.  not at all.  hatred bread long ago has slowly been disappearing over the months until now when its no longer a hatred but a indifference.  will it change, i don't know.  many a night i did spend wondering what things would be like if way back things had been different..but i've been living my reality-and i like it.  what ifs, though sometimes fun to ponder, aren't really worth it because if given the choice-i don't think i'd chose a different path.  simply because i've lived this one, and i like who i am because of the rocks i passed and the turns i've taken.  and for you the same exists.  if you hadn't taken your path, your life wouldn't be what it is today.  who knows who you'd be instead.  so let the memories flood, and let the thoughts be provoked.  maybe its just another turn in the path.  another bend.  another rock.  another stream.  do we chose to follow?  lets see.

you came in like a storm 
a fury of emotions 
there was no eye to the hurricane
only extreme ends 
happy, sad
enraged, enthralled
i felt inebriated,
infuriated
and with out the eye as warning 
you were gone before i knew
gone
you left me standing alone
so in your wake i woke up
i threw debris away
i built stronger walls 
a better foundation
and now 
i stand by myself
proud of where i am 
no storm will knock me down again
not yours, or anybodys
so long as your coming now
as the eye you never had
the calm
the reprieve
so long as your coming without wakes
and floods
without torment and destruction
so long as your coming well intentioned
and humbly
realizing your past furor
so long as this is so
youre welcome
come in 
no shoes allowed 
shoe souls leave bruises on the heart
don't trespass within my inner walls
expect nothing and you'll get more than you wish for
yes, come like that
and you 
shall be welcomed

drunken nights with friends are the best nights to have.  small party at my house.  not too many people.  enough to have a good time.  jt got stupid.  he had to be put to bed.  it was hilarious.  i think people had a good time.  i know i did.  though the sunlight was brutal on my alcohol-drenched eyes this morning.  i hope to always remember the beer pong played in my little kitchen, and the most ridiculous game of asshole played by me since the UNE EMS trip to washington dc.  that game goes down in the record books.  there were many chips eaten.  and many bottle caps strewn in my ""caps here"" jar.  <3  clean up wasn't so bad.  the house looks good as new.  
friday night was a lonely night.  quiet.  serene.  boring.  whatever you want to call it.  it was a reflective sad night hot and sticky it was difficult to sleep.  
sleep-i should sleep now.  my legs are restless.  and i'm thirsty.  but sleep does sound good.  yes?

"event","its a good weekend.  one of those times where you feel like life is good.  the sun is out today - we had a thunderstorm yesterday.  i <3 thunderstorms.  went to hilary's wedding shower yesterday.  lots of people in adam's family who i don't know, and probably never will know.  but, i got to see brooke, shannon's daughter, who is 3.5months old.  she's adorable.  wicked.  so, i chileed with shannon and erin for a bit.  it was good fun.  weird to think that in a couple weeks-2from yesterday to be exact-hilary will be married.  and her and adam will move away with audrey and olivia to live in the bottom of conneticut.  strangeness.  i never lived more than a couple miles from hilary-in my life.  except when we were at college.  and even then - it was only 2hours.  now it'll be more like 3-3.5 i think.  -eep-  its weird the different stages of life people around me are going through.  it all seems so-grown up.  and yet, i don't feel any different.  yes, i have wyatt-and i'm a mom-but i still feel like me.  i still act like me.  i'm in no real rush to get engaged, or married, or have more babies.  nope.  i mean-maybe someday.  maybe even someday in the nearish future.  but, i'm not planning it, or thinking about it.  and then there are people around me-who think about having more kids, and getting houses, and husbands, and puppies.  white picket fences.  i never wanted one.  i still don't.  i just want to be.  to be happy. and healthy.  to never loose my youth-despite getting older.  to never become crochety, or bitter.  to be a friend to my son-a mentor-and a mom.  and to be with the one i love-because i love him, and because he loves me.  yep. i just want to be me.  i'm gonna do it my way.  and thats good.  i don't want to think about planning weddings, or finding gowns.  not now.  maybe not ever.  maybe tomorrow.  who knows.  thats the way my life is.  and thats the way i like it now.  :o)
its late. i haven't showered. dana left a few minutes ago for the carshow.  i hope the debut of his car goes well.  i plan on visiting.  i plan on checking out the vintage cars.  i have until 8.  at some point i'll go.  ..vrrroomm..
this week looks like an okay one.  workin. and schoolin. gettin my first lecture exam back on tuesday. and taking my first lab exam on thursday. -ew- i think i did rather well on my first exam. but lab practicums are not my forte.  especially since there is a lot of identifying organisms under the microscope involved, and i seem to have issues with the colors under the microscope.  blue-purple-red.  they all sorta look the same.  hopefully it wont be so bad.  -luck needed- and then, this weekend-my 'rents are going to stowe vt. my dad has a roadrace to run.  so i wish him luck.  and i'm going to have a good weekend.  me, jt and wyatt.  and then dana.  and maybe some friends.  a small party may ensue.  i think it sounds like a wonderful idea.  i haven't partied in a long time.  since new years.  so-hopefully-we'll have a small gathering of people and a bit of alcohol and some good times. <3
alright. time to get unstinky.  SnHaOkWeEdR   my fav!  :o)

"event","three years ago today-i worked the night shift at jc's icecream stand with a boi. we closed at 10, and boss-lady mrs. cena let us go after a quick clean up (since i was working the next day).  that boi and i watched the fireworks from the tennis courts-which was silly because we couldn't see the fireworks, just the illumination in the sky, and then from the lovely yellow-line in the middle of the road.  and it was beautiful.  it was the night we had our first kiss..and the night a lot of things began.  today-me and that boi went to the beach with my family, and at our favourite chicken fingers from our favourite beach-front resteraunt.  i love that boi.  so yay to us dana.  yay to us for making it through so much.  for traversing adverse conditions.  for being good to each other.  for always laughing at our stupidity, and finding beauty in everything we do.  yay to us.  -happy anniversary sweetie-  one million sweddish fishies, always.  <3

okay. done with that. 

a lot has happened since my last post.  
wyatts birthday for one. 
we had a big party the day before his real birthday *because his real birthday was on father's day and its not such a good day to have a party* so.. it was good.  the weather was inclimate so we jammed 35+ people into my little house.  and it was crowded.  but fun.  if i knew how to post pictures-i'd post them of wyatt eating cake.  because it was a beautiful thing.  maybe someday i'll learn.  :o)  so his birthday was a great sucess.  i was a happy mommi.  i can't believe he's one though.  it really does go by very fast. very very fast.  <3  
8days later, was my birthday.  not such a big deal made.  but still, a good day.  my twenty-first birthday.  -yummi-  i haven't used my legalness since that day, when i went to dinner with my 'rents and wyatt and go a drink.  but tonight-later-i might go to the bar with dana and some of his guys.  so that will be cool.  so, happy twenty one to me.  thanks to everyone for their birthday wishes...  -and here they are-

so, today.  the beach.  wyatt's first true time going.  i mean, we took him last summer, but i don't think that really counts.  especially since he generally slept the entire time we were there, never touched the sand or the water.  yeah, that doesn't count.  but, today was awesome.  he really enjoyed the waves, even though it was cold in the water.  and the sand didn't bother him a bit, he had such a good time.  he's exhausted though.  -me too-  so, today was a good day.  i'm a little on the lobster side of life, but its all good..in a couple days, it won't hurt any more and i'll be a sexy-tan girlie.  hehehe  oh well.  i <3 the beach.  dana and i need to buy a surf-board soon  *we have to go in on it together cuz they're uber expensive for my budget*  :o)

"event","thank goodness friday always comes! 
this has been a tremendous week.  good one really.  other than the baby-throwing-up part, that was yuckie.  yes. its been a good week. 
dana is gone to bonnaroo.  last i heard from him, which was just before they pitched their tents, they had made good time and were having fun already.  i don't expect to hear from him.  he best be having far too good of a time with his guys, the music, the beer, the atmosphere.  oh my am i jealous.  perhaps next year i'll be able to venture with them.  -maybe-  he should return monday or tuesday...depending on what time they make driving.  so we shall see then.  i do hope he brings lots of good stories, and pictures so i can live vicariously through him.  :o)
work is..busy.  katie, my boss, is leaving.  -sadness-  i've been with her for so long.  6 years.  and yeah, sometimes i hate her and can't stand her managerial skills or her attitude or whatever.  but for the most part-actually, all the time-i really do like her.  love her you might say.  i've grown up at new england cardiology.  they've seen everything.  my 15th birthday, my permit, my license, my graduation, my prom, my social, getting accepted to colleges, going to college, coming back broke from college, getting pregnant, having wyatt, not to mention all the guy emotional garbage they've heard about, and the dramatic teenage bullshit.  they've seen it all.  and katie has seriously been a huge part of my life.  and an amazing boss, especially when it comes to being flexible, and teaching me new things.  from day one it has been katie, me, michele, and lisa.  after august-it will only be michele and i left.  and the doctors of course.  i guess someday i'll leave to..and it will be a sad day.  if it weren't for these people, for their intensity in teaching me--i never would have even tried to get into medical field, let alone apply as pre-med...and get in!  who'd of thought that a simple after school filing job-that started out as ""yeah, my daughter will help you move your charts from your old office to your new office one saturday in august"" would change so much?  in anycase.  its sad that she's leaving.  good for her, cuz she's going to do her clinical stuff-and then she'll have recieved her masters in nursing, therefore being a nurse practicioner.  i'm proud.  <3

wyatt is doing amazingly.  he stood up-in the middle of the floor-all by himself for the very first time tonight.  until now, he's always needed to hold something or whatever to stand.  and now...he doesn't.  he's getting so big.  i can't believe what a whirlwind the last year has been.  things just happen so quickly.  -whee-

i have nothing else to say.  but i do have a lot to do tonight before i sleep.  -have an amazing weekend-  i hope the weather proves to be beautiful.

"event","called in to work today.  cuz wyatt was throwing up this morning.  he's all better now.  :o)  so, i could go into work..but, the sun is shining, and i never get to spend real ""alone time"" with him.  since on weekend's the family is home.  so today-we're just chillen together.  building blocks, and reading stories.  we just made some jello -yum- and i think soon enough we'll venture outside with some blocks.  i need to go and buy some more out-door toys.  he has a swing, and a slide.  he's not so into the slide right now.  maybe i'll wait til after his birthday though--thats probably a good idea.  :o)  i'm so excited about his party.  its gonna be crazy fun.  i can't wait.  and to think - 8days after he turns one, i turn twenty-one.  -whee-  don't know what i'm doing yet.  probably nothing that day-maybe party during the weekend? i dunno we'll see.  
dana is leaving tomorrow for bonaroo.  he'll be back tuesdayish.  but-tuesday i have the open house for band, and then wednesday we have a performance during a middle school play.  so maybe i'll see him thursday?  depends on when he's leaving to go to laconia.  he's doing a lot of fun-with-the-guys traveling in the next two-weeks.  good for him.  i'm jealous.  hehehe.. not so much, but whatev.  
jenn and simmie came over last night.  it was soo good to see the two of them again, to hang out and talk, and watch a movie, and whatever together..again.  its been so long.  we might do a dinner outing this thursday too-cuz simmie leaves for Ithaca on friday.  we shall see.  we shall see.  :o)  no matter, i'm a happy girl.  

its weird to think how much we evolve in a year.  how much things change-and yet, remain relatively the same.  how much we grow.  how we gain friends, and loose friends.  people float in and out of our lives, leaving their little foot prints so that maybe someday we'll think of them-we'll miss them.  or maybe we'll hate them.  who knows.  i know i'm in a very different spot than i was a year ago.  and no, things aren't perfect-and maybe they never will be.  but thats okay.  cuz everyday i wake i up there's an itty-bitty smile to be seen (itty bitty smile = very loud boi) and more things to discover.  thats whats cool about life.  sometimes i feel bad that one particular person missed everything.  but most of the time-i don't think of him at all.  mainly around holidays etc.  probably because i feel for wyatt.  not for the ones now, but in the future.  but then again...we all make choices.  and no matter what we think, they work out for the best.  and me and wyatt - are the best family i could ever ask for.  <3  

corney time is over.  

oh!  i forgot!  this past saturday was the kickingest saturday!  (kickingest? yeah, whatev)  my 'rents watched wyatt over night, and i went to dana's cuz i'm not going to see him for a lil while.  so we had a party.  we were supposed to go to a cookout..but instead, he cooked me dinner -yum-  chicken, and broccoli, and mashed potatos.  but, before that-we went shopping...finally.  *excitement*  i'm a happy lil girl.  :o)  and after dinner, we sat around talking-drinking a bit-watching spongebobsquarepants the movie!  and just chillen.  then, we slept til...get this..  11:30!!!  i was in HEAVEN!!!  you never realize how good it is, until you haven't done it in a months and months and months.  and by it .. i mean sleeping past 730am.   really, i do.  

alright, snack time is over.  gotta go

began the work week.  and led to the next three days of insanity.  worked 8-530  *repeat wednesday and thursday* since michele was on vacation - down one girl, and a file clerk, and kate was in the stress lab 2days, and sonia has wednesday off.  -phew-  i'm tired of being at work.  wednesday was supposed to be practice..thank god.  cuz i should have gone home and crashed in a little ball on the floor.  instead, i cleaned the bathrooms, kitchen and living room, did 2loads of laundry, and passed out a little after 11.  thursday brought the same insanity at work.  and then a dinnah date with boi.  yum.  we played pool-and tried to go shopping, but the store was closed.  -sadness-  it was much needed.  then today-more work.  lots of work.  played catch up.  though i'm still far-far-far behind. ewww.  and then me and mom went shopping with wyatt to the mall-and got him all cute summer clothes.  he desperately needed shorts, and tee-shirts, and romper-type-boi outfits.  so, he got them.  and its good! :o)  in anycase.  in four days this week i worked 37.5 hours!  -eep-  so add in holiday pay for monday, and last weeks hours (of which there were quite a few)  means... i can't wait to get next weeks pay check! it'll feel soo good to have a little bit of money - my money - in my account.  just to be there.  plus-i should buy my microbiology book sooon! :o) 

but whatev.  i have a lot to do tonight.  gotta finish my laundry, and put it away of course (ewww)  and then...finish a grocery list, do some yoga maybe and work the ab-lounger.  going on the southbeach diet monday with my 'rents.  should be good.  when ""everyone"" in the house is on a diet-its WAY easier to comply.  plus-dana is going to bonaroo (yay crappy spelling) and laconia.  so, he'll be gone for a while.  so hopefully i'll get in some walk/run time.  <3  yay.  i'm pumped. and motivated. and woohoo!  

starting to plan wyatt's bday party too.  whee!  so much fun!  luvin it!  i scheduled a pic-appointment for a nice little thursday.  so hopefully that will go extra-super-well.  and we'll get awesome happy birthday pics.  and even better, if i can get a little weight off...maybe i'll be able to get in pics with him.  i haven't had them taken with him yet.  i actually don't have much more to loose since i had him.  more toning than anything - thank you ab-lounger.  :o)  -wish me luck-  hehehe   whatev.  beauty isn't just skin deep right?  

oh! i got the best fortune today.. 
*then can not take our self-respect if we do not give it to them*   
take that fuckers!  hehehe  yeah..whatev.   i'm hyper (can ya tell?)  i'm gonna go do something more productive than this.   ttys.

-peaCee & love-  

...and kisses too  MUAH..."

watching your son knock down block towers with his forehead  PRICELESS 

corniest update ever!! woohoo!
no seriously.  wyatt started today knocking down block towers you build for him, with his forehead.  a nice little head butt to the blocks.  
funniest thing ever. 

other new developments?
he does motions to certain songs.  so far - twinkle twinkle little star, and the itsy bitsy spider.  but we're working on the fishy song, and a few others too. 
and walking is getting closer and closer to the main mode of transportation.  
its so cute to see him walking around - sooo cute!

"event","this past weekend was such a good weekend.  possibly one of the best i've had.  <33  it was soo good it deserves a play-by-play.  

-friday-
after working til 430 (yeah...boss let us out 1/2 an hour early.  how kick butt is that?!?) went home, and changed real fast.  it was jt's social.  so we all were going to liz's with him to take picz etc.  and my lovely boi dana was driving the lovely couple to the dance.  he seriously worked on his car too.  talk about shiney! (gotta love shiney things!) so.  we drove.  there was some good talk at deburro's bout dana's car.  it was nice.  and i think that jt & liz thoroughly enjoyed it.  :o)  then it was back to my house.  dana was supposed to drive down to zacks for the night-so he left like he was gonna.. and instead ended up coming back here for the night.  reasons need not be discussed.  but he did.  so he stayed over - and it was a good night.  we passed out early, and wyatt slept straight through til 530.  
-saturday-
at 530 wyatt and i got up, played for a couple hours-ate breakfast-the normal stuff.  and at 815, it was back to bed for a nap.  *a 2.5hour nap*  we actually ended up being late for what we had planned because wyatt slept soo well (i've never ever ever had to say anything even close to that before!) i actually woke up in a panic before wyatt got up from his nap thinking something was wrong.  so..  11am dana bolted from here, back to his house to pack for virginia beach.  i finished getting ready and left around noon.   wyatt spent the night with nana & grampa.  <3  drove over to dana's, hopped in his car, and we drove down to westfield.  *party*  *party*  *party*  -happy graduation zack-  it was such a good time.  just hanging out with other couples, chillen.  its so nice to feel that ""freedom"" every now and then.  eventually, around 8? i think? we drove back up here...its like a 2hour drive so..ya know.  we got up to dana's house, cooked up some chicken kiev and pasta, ate in front of the tv sprawled out on his bed.  and then passed out.  literally.  i actually slept all night, i my jeans, on top of the covers.  yeah...it was that good of a day.  :o)
-sunday- 
up far too early again.  515.  with a massive headache, completely confused as to why i was still in my clothes and sleeping on top of the bed, but thankful that dana was sweet enough to put a blanket over me... then, getting ready.  we even had a lovely crazy search for dana's cell phone, which we're pretty sure we left at zack & chell's (go figure).  and then we drove the lovely drive down 128,95&93 to logan airport...again.  and he was gone.  back to virginia beach for another week.  -tear- so i came home, played with wyatt-who was cheerfully awake and playing when i got home (yeah, home at like 730am) and at 845am we both went down for a nap.  another really good one.  2hours!  it was great.  so then we spent the afternoon chillaxin, and then we went shopping with my mom for outfits for the band banquet on tuesday.  i got a seriously cute outfit.  i'm actually excited to wear it.  the rest of the night was pretty normal.  and i just got outta the hot tub with jt.  -good times-  

so yes, this weekend was fabulous.  i completely loved everything about it.  spending time with dana - just the two of us - can be so perfect.  i love being with wyatt, love it, but every once in a while its beautiful to be a couple.  and just a couple.  

this week should be good. absolutely nothing stressfull going on.  work.  band banquet.  colorguard open house.  practice.  the normal stuff. 
OH!  hilary is engaged...getting married in July, and their expecting their first child together in february sometime.   i'm so happy for her!  and him!  they're both so excited.  i'm excited for them.  its so good to see things work out for people.  you know?  plus - adam is amazing with the girls.  :o)  so happy :o)
i think thats all the news i have for now.  i have some ""loose ends"" i should tie up.  cuz i'm tired of being made into a bad guy and trashed on.  i feel the need to set a few things straight.  but, i'm going to be decent and do that so that not everyone on the internet can read it...cuz thats what grown ups do.  right?  :o)  

alright.. i think sleep is a good idea.  no..cleaning.. and then sleep. 
it seems like i always have to clean.  nothing ever stays neat.  oh well, at least there is always something to do..  hehe

-peace & love-"

"event","the extremes that days and months and years can take in your life are what make it life.  right?  the fact that you can have the lowest low you've ever felt, and the highest most elated moment of your existance in the same relative time frame.  that makes life interesting.  it makes life, life.  right?  what i hate most about this lovely phenomenon is that once you've felt a low-you work your way out, generally by hitting an amazing high first, and then starting from the second wrung from the bottom.  but, along your climb you must first take two steps forward one step back, or maybe one step forward two steps back.  who knows.  thats the part i hate.  the part that feels like just when you're getting to where you need to/want to be something comes and slashes you back down.  i don't think thats fair.  to anyone.  but, more over-to people who work their butts off everyday.  who are dedicated to working, and to living, who do their very best, who sleep minimal hours and play hard.  those people deserve breaks of fate.  how come fate doesn't feel that way?  someone should talk to fate.  tell him whats what.  we should revolt.  refuse to be pushed down, to run into the wind when the storms brew.  to fight the current.  i think in many aspects of my life i'm able to do this.  but there is one..one very complicated, very important, aspect of my life where no matter what happens i feel like i'm always behind, and i can try and fight the current all i want-i'm still going to loose.  for now at least.  and that current, that terrible aspect is money.  who the fuck decided we'd use a currency anyways? and who decided that working full time hours being called ""per-diem"" would be legal...so that companies could get out of giving you sick time, vacation time, and of course maternity leave.  who decided that?  -dumbass-  who decided it was okay to not support children? that moms would have to jump through hoops to ""chase down"" dead-beat dads?  thats dumb.  thats majorly dumb.  not to mention, in my opinion, not worth the hassel.  i mean, money's money.  and you either have it or you don't.  so you can stress it out (and sometimes you have to) but, why make it worse by worrying about court dates and paper work and checks from the child-service department?  i can't bring myself to do it.  though i should-i know i should.  people tell me all the time.  why let him get off without having to be responsible for anything?  but, i guess i thought..in the beginning at least..that he'd step forward and take responsibility where it was due.  i was wrong.  go figure, another thing i was wrong about.  thank god i didn't want to be a psychologist.  ewwww.  so thus is life. somehow things all come down to money.  vacation.  do we have the money?  dinner.  how much does it cost?  caught speeding.  pay up!  money money money money.  i hate it.  everyone should hate it.  but, thus is life.  
my life right now? other than money. is good.  
work is busy-and i'm working ten extra hours a week.  so thats good.  it helps them out, and i like the pay checks.  i haven't gotten my grades yet.  i really need to start applications for nursing school.  i'm ready to go in the fall-but i probably wont be headed that way til spring. but thats okay.  i should be done within the next two years.  thank god.  wyatt is doing amazingly.  he's so big.  eleven months tomorrow.  he takes steps here and there.  he loves to do the stairs.  he might be getting more teeth nowish.  which is good cuz, i'm trying to get him on ""real"" food-but he only has two teeth so chewing is difficult.  we're having problems with biting, but thats normal.  and he still doesn't sleep through the night.  but, i'm sorta used to that now.  it sucks, but i deal.  i can't believe how close his birthday is, this year was so amazing and it flew by.  dana and i are doing well.  he's going to virginia again, which sucks.  he leaves sunday (wicked early) BUT i am staying at his house saturday night..so i think we're partying..i'm rather excited about that.  and we're planning to take a lil five-day vacation, just the two of us, this summer-camping.  i'm rather excited.  so yay for that.  we got a hottub at my house.  it rocks.  completely and totally.  maybe you can visit it..if ya ask really nicely!  so yeah, i think thats pretty much my life.  i miss beth-i need to go and visit her soon.  -muahs to you girlie-  
i think i'm going to do some yoga and go to bed early.  cuz that sounds like an uber good idea.  i ran 1.5 miles yesterday, and i plan to do it again tomorrow and then again on saturday.  i severly hope i keep it up.  gotta be a sexy mama for my baby's first birthday party!  -yikes-  
alright, i'm outtie.

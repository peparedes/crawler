i always think about the guy with such a pretty smile
the kind that replaces any thoughts you had in your head before he came along.
i think about the older mature, faithful man
one with modesty in him, true nature of sensitivity. i think about him, i think about him understanding me but never getting it and it's okay because he is loyal, he is wonderful. he doesn't need to know anything about me, all he needs to do is hold me, smile caringly like he means it. 
remy, a character in the movie i've just watched was played by the actor in the picture above. he has a french accent though sounds sexier speaking english without it. he's 39 and wow! okay i'm done. ehehehe he's so fucking beautiful and soft spoken, it's totally adorable.
the picture is a HORRIBLE one of him OH WELL."

well not so much giving up as becoming passive

there is just no use for being ""passionate"" all the time 

i'm like the floppy corners of a wet page, slowly bending down to shred off."

well... seeing that physics requires a lot of math, i'm a little behind in the nearly begun course, and of course i've failed grade ten math. which i skipped today. so, i doubt they are changing courses anymore, though i REALLY need to because i will fail. but i've decided that taking the time during physics to improve my drawing might be handy. also, i can read. 

lately i've been listening to so much electro
i really don't know why.... the music is appealing to me so much

that is all to be said. k good day."

"event","<center>poetic madness drains from my mind.
you've fucked me there too many times.
heart in throat.
I'm all choked up.
I wish I was.
now give me sanity.
this is the love I can't control and now you've lost it.
and you're just so fucking crazy.
you make me crazy.
dopesick and depressed, but she's magnetic.
she's so magnetic.
you make me crazy.
you make me so fucking crazy.
a bittersweet orgasmic mindfuck
or the smoothest sheet of something stainless will pleasure me for now.
and now I find myself where the needle was too weak.
and now I find myself where the razor couldn't speak.
now cover me in your green essence lovely.
distance where I can't touch you.
that's where the gun will touch you.
paint up that pretty face you're something I wish I was.
paint up that pretty face.
give me this agony.
paint up that pretty face.
her makeup smears away with the tears.
that eye-liners runnin and she's runnin away from me.
the lipstick stains like gold and for that moment I wanted to be her.
feeling how I failed her.
and now the drama bites hard.
you're the poison in the bottle in that just knocked me out.
a simulcast signing off yeah mind controls a bitch.
I'm on that downer depressant.
that overcast chill and she's just so fucking sexy.
yeah. lips like sin. die like sin.
I'm on that downer depressant.
that overcast chill.
she's dressed in black and dressed to kill.

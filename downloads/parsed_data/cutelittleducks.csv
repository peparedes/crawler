"event","My roommate Sara has been really sick since Sunday. She went to Health Services on Wednesday and they told her that she probably had the flu. The weird thing is that she doesn't have any cold/flu symptoms. She has pain in her neck and back and she has a lump behind one of her ears. So today she went to Doctor's Care. I hope she'll be okay.

I'm also getting sick. I just have a cold, which is not as serious, but I still feel pretty miserable. I have a presentation to give on Monday. I'm almost done with it, but now that I'm feeling sick it's going to be a lot harder to get it done. All I want to do is go back to sleep, but I know that I can't. I really need more cold medicine, so if anyone can give me a ride to CVS, I would greatly appreciate it. I decided to stay here this weekend so I could get my work done, but I'm starting to think that it was a mistake because I don't want to get my roommate or anyone else sick."

A friend recently asked me this question. It scared me that I didn't know how to answer it. So my friend asked me my name and a few things that I like. But there's more to it than that. I am a living and breathing human being with a unique personality and unique opinions. However, instead of expressing these opinions, I'm the kind of person who will go along with what others say even if I don't agree with it. I'm always afraid of saying something that's stupid or offensive and so I end up not saying much at all. 

This keeps people from knowing who I really am and what I believe. The greatest moments in history happened because individuals chose to go against what was expected of them and express what they believed to be true. So what do I believe? I believe in a lot of things. As soon as I figure it all out, you'll be the first to know. I hope I can find myself...whoever I am."

Today a miraculous thing happened. I had been stressing for weeks trying to figure out how to pay for my books for this semester. My dad and I thought that we would have to pay for them ourselves. Luckily, we talked to the people in the financial aid office and they gave me an SEOG grant of $500 which covers the balance that I owed and the cost of my books. I'm so relieved! I know Columbia College couldn't have made this happen so it must be a miracle from God. 

So now I'm back at school getting ready for a new semester. I was a nervous wreck all day today but now things are finally calming down. I have a super cool roommate now and I know that this semester is going to be good."

"event","Hey everybody.
It's Sunday night and I'm just hanging out here at home. I decided to go back to school tomorrow instead of tonight since my sisters will be out of school and I didn't want my mom to have to deal with them by herself for the whole day. I actually have school though and my butt (which is really big according to my sister Sarah) needs to be in Spanish class at 2:00.

This weekend was definitely crazy. I came home Thursday night and we had pizza for dinner. It was really good. Not like the pizza at Columbia College...lol. Anyway, Sarah and Lydia basically took over my computer for the weekend so they could play games online (Bratz, MyScene, Polly, Barbie etc...) and Sarah complained for most of the weekend because I didn't bring home my printer. I swear that child only loves me for my computer and printer. She kept thanking me over and over for bringing the computer home. I'm going to be so glad when we get a new home computer that will actually work with our sucky internet service. My dad did say that we could get better internet service when we get the new computer, but there's no guarantee on that especially since our finances are so bad right now. 

Anyway, I'll be online for a little while longer and hopefully I'll get to talk to Cathy. If you want to talk to me, feel free to leave a comment or send me a message on AIM. My screenname is shewontbeback. I will give a prize to the first person who can name the song that I got my screenname from."

"event","Today was definitely crazy. I woke up this morning around 7:40 and had to rush my 8:00 class (Business Law). I didn't get much sleep last night. I went to bed around 11:30 but I couldn't get to sleep and I finally got to sleep a little after 12. I usually need 8 hours of sleep so of course I couldn't get up in time. Since I overslept, I didn't get a chance to take a shower and I felt gross for most of the day. (Ew, Kelly!) So anyway I had Business Law, Survey of Popular Music, and of course lovely American Literature. 

I decided to go to the cafe to get lunch so I could have time for some last minute studying for my  economics test. This is a nice theory since the cafeteria lines are usually pretty long, but today the cafe was crowded too. I finally got back to my room at around 12:45 and quickly ate my sandwich and drank my large sweet tea. I love sweet tea, so it's probably a good thing that I live here in South Carolina. 

I went to class and took my test and got out by 2:30. Then I decided to go to my Spanish professor's office to get my rough draft of my paper. I walked all the way across the street to Parker House and I was a little out of breath. Of course my professor asked me all kinds of questions about why I wrote certain things on my paper and I honestly couldn't think straight since I was so tired. She seemed to feel sorry for me though and finally let me leave. I took a shower when I got back to the room. I played online for awhile and then took a nap before dinner. 

As I was leaving the cafeteria there were these girls standing by the conveyor belt. They were waiting to see the ""seam"" of the conveyor belt. One girl said that an alumnae told her that if you see the seam then you'll get asked out on a date. I thought that was kind of funny but I kept my opinion to myself. I walked out of the cafeteria and started talking to two of the girls. Their names are Nicole and Leanne. They are both first year students and of course they are a lot taller and prettier than I am. It made me sad. But they were nice and maybe I'll see them around campus.

So now I'm hanging out with Brienna. Cathy was hanging out with us too, but I think she has homework to do. I should be doing homework too, but I think I might slack off a little since I don't have any classes tomorrow.

It's very frustrating to try to do what you're supposed to do and not being able to. I'm going to talk to Dr. Love and get more specific instructions about how to use the listening room. Hopefully it will all work out.

<lj-cut text= ""details"">
I went to my Spanish class at 2:00 but when I got there no one was there. So I walked down the hall to see if anyone was on the way there but I didn't see anyone. I waited until about 10 minutes after 2:00 and finally gave up. I called my professor to let her know that I at least tried to go to class. I guess the class was moved or something but I'm not sure because I was absent on Wednesday. 


I also tried to get my Survey of Music homework done today. We were supposed to go to the Listening Room (Spears 105) to listen to a CD and do a worksheet about it. I went there last week but the only person who was there was from the Art Department and she didn't know how to help me. Today I went to Spears 138 to get the key and then headed for Room 105. I knocked on the door (not too quietly) and no one answered. So I unlocked the door and went inside. I waited for a few minutes to see if anyone would come back but of course they didn't. So I looked around and tried to find a CD or something that had either Dr. Love's name or Music 205 on it. I didn't have any luck finding anything and I gave up.

The day did get better though. My Orgy poster came in the mail today!!! OMG! It's so cool. I love it! It has a picture of the band from the Vapor Transmission era. I put it on the wall above my bed.

I got my green ""express student"" card in the mail from Columbia College. This meant that all of my financial aid was taken care of and all I would have to do on Saturday is pick up my key. Sounds too good to be true, right?

Unfortunately, this was too good to be true. Today I got an orange card that says I have a hold in the Business Office. So now I have to go up there and try to sort all of this craziness out. I got my hopes up for nothing then. I was so happy and excited! I was bouncing around my house like a crazy person (in a good way) and now I have to hope and pray that everything will turn out okay. 

I'm not the only one who has to deal with this though. Two of my friends are facing similar problems. I'm not going to give up though and I hope my friends won't either. I was in the Business Office last year up until the last possible minute and the school still managed to help me out. I'm hoping that they can work with me again this year too."

Today was definitely interesting. My parents and I drove up to Winston-Salem, NC for my mom's doctor's appointment. It's not the most exciting thing to do, but I was glad to get out of Columbia for awhile. It took us about 3 hours to get there, but only about 2 hours and 45 minutes to get back. It rained most of the way and it was kind of awkward to sit in a car with parents for so long. We finally got back home around 2:30, so we went to pick my sisters up from school and then came home. I've been helping Lydia with a project this week -- just a little bit every day -- and it's finally done. I wanted to print out pictures in color for her, but my stupid printer messed everything up. So we printed the pics in black and white. They still look pretty good though and I'm hoping that ""our"" hard work will pay off. I will cry my eyes out if she doesn't get a B or better.

"event","Hi everyone. I hope the summer is going well for you. Things are a little better here. I'm starting to get used to the idea of babysitting my sisters for the rest of my life (just kidding) Only 6 weeks and 2 days left until my sisters start school! In a way, I am thankful that I have this time to get to know them better, but like I said before it's a lot of pressure to have to be a mother-figure for them. 

My friend Amanda is babysitting kids too and she has to deal with some of the same pressures that I do. It makes me realize that not everyone is having a ""perfect"" summer. I didn't really expect to have a perfect summer, but this year is less than ideal. I was hoping to be able to work for pay, but I'm not too worried because my dad says he will make sure I have enough money to go back to school. I will get 2 weeks  to myself after my sisters start school, so that will be my time to do what I want to do. 

I miss all of my Columbia College friends. I know I haven't been keeping in touch with all of you, but I promise I'll be better about that. I can't wait to get back to school. I know we're going to have an awesome year!

I really do love my sisters, but babysitting them for the entire summer is bit much to ask. So instead of taking care of them 10 hours a day, it's more like 8 hours. Though it would be better if we could actually go places instead of staying home all day. The work from home job isn't what my dad expected it to be and I think we're going to give up on it. So no money for me. I was really looking forward to working. I tend to be less irritable when I have something constructive to do. Maybe it won't be so bad though."

I really do love my sisters but they really get on my nerves. They fight with each other over the stupidest things and expect me to be a mediator. I try to calm things down but most of the time they have to work it out on their own. 

Like today, Sarah found a little toy truck in my room (don't ask) and started playing with it. Lydia wanted to play with it too and somehow she got it and took it back to her room. She went into her room and wouldn't let Sarah in and I had to tell them to please share it. That's nothing compared to yesterday though. They were fighting over the chair in the living room. Lydia was sitting in the chair, but got out of it ""just for a minute"" and screamed her head off when she saw that Sarah was sitting in it. There was a lot of yelling and door slamming before things finally calmed down.

Children fascinate me. They pretend to be sweet when someone's watching them, but the second the parents turn their backs, kids turn into little devils!
Now do you see why I don't want kids? Hopefully you'll respect my decision.

So that's my life right now. Trying to keep the house clean and keep my sisters under control. This isn't going to be my ideal summer, but somehow I'll get through it.

<lj-cut text="" I love these guys"">
I was looking on Ebay for Orgy merchandise and found an awesome copy of Candyass. It says that it's a ""still stickered CANDYASS 12 trax CD foldout booklet"" which really caught my attention. I thought that the album review was especially good. Here's the website:
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=1574&item=4723329310&rd=1
<BR>
Album Notes
Orgy: Jay, Ryan, Amir, Bobby, Paige. Additional personnel: Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar); Josh Abraham, Jay Gordon (synthesizer, programming); Elijah Blue (synthesizer, background vocals); Dieter (drums); Anthony Valcic (programming); Jonathan Davis (background vocals). Recorded at Donner Pass Cabin, Truckee, California; N.R.G. Studios, North Hollywood, California; Josh's Garage, Hollywood, California; Westlake Audio, West Hollywood, California. Detractors will undoubtedly peg them as Marilyn Manson imitators, but that's like putting down Stevie Ray Vaughan for his Hendrixisms. 

<font color= ""blue"">
The band works well within the parameters of their chosen genre, and if you go for the industrial-inflected synth rock of Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, etc., you'd be foolish to overlook CANDYASS. The sonic assualt is almost unrelentingly brutal, as pounding drums, jackhammer guitars and wailing, buzzing synths (all heavily processed) pin your ears back. The cold, detached vocal style matches the uncompromising electro-rock arrangements perfectly. Apocalyptic, iconoclastic and willfully abrasive, ORGY is the worst nightmare of every teen's parents, and that's what rock & roll's all about. </FONT>

""the worst nightmare of every teen's parents"" LOL! Yes indeed. :-P

Tuesday

I don't like the idea of sitting in the house by myself for 4 months. My mom will be at home with me for the next month or so and my sisters will probably have to stay home with me at some point, but I am not looking forward to that. Unless I get my permit and start driving, it's not very likely that I can get a job. My advisor said that I don't really need to take any summer classes right now, but I wish I could anyway. I am going to be bored out of my mind. There will be plenty of dishes and laundry to wash but that gets old after awhile. I wish I could do something more with my life.

I think you all know that I'm not a sick pervert or anything. The DVD includes live concert footage, a photo gallery for each band member, and a question-answer session. It's going to be so awesome. The poll is for people to vote on a price for the DVD. It's going to cost around $16 - $17. And it will be available in stores!!! Yay! I can't buy anything online anyway. I know I'm the only one who is excited about this, but I just had to share.

"event","Well, not exactly small...just young.
I know I'm 19 and that makes me an adult but I don't feel like one. I swear I'm the only person on this whole campus who doesn't drive yet. I don't feel like I've experienced everything that normal 19-year-olds experience. I'm missing out on so much.

So if you insist on having children someday, please keep a few things in mind...
<lj-cut text= ""10 things"">
1. Let your child get his/her permit at age 15 or very soon after - the law allows this for a reason!!!
2. Let your child get his/her license at age 17
3. If he/she can't drive by these ages - don't allow your 19-year-old to go to college without reliable transportation--he or she will get tired of sitting in the dorm all day.
4. Let your child think for himself/herself. Don't pressure him/her to have the same beliefs that you do.
5. Respect your child's tastes in music, movies, clothes, etc.
6. Allow your child to socialize on a regular basis...people skills are very important no matter what career field you go into and being around people gives you an all around good feeling
7. Don't make your child feel guilty about not coming home...let him/her come home when he or she is ready to.
8. Call your child often to make sure his/her life is going well. Ask about school, friends, life in general...
9. Send money to your child often...he/she will appreciate it and you'll feel good knowing that he/she can get what he/she needs and wants.
10. Let your child know that you love them no matter what they do.

It's just something to think about...

Management class was ok today too. We talked about motivation!!! fun stuff...someone needs to motivate me to get my work done.
Faith, Cathy, and I went to Faith's house and ate really good food. We sat around and talked (well, they talked and I listened...lol) and we watched House. I got to see Faith's cute little puppy named Gabby. She is so precious. I'm not really a dog person, but she's so sweet. So now I'm back on campus and hanging out with my cool friends. They rock! Cathy still hasn't taught me how to play ""Blue Monday"" yet though. It makes me sad that she can play it and she's not even really a fan.

My roommate and I got locked out of the bathroom this morning. We called our suitemates but they weren't there. We called Pam and she wasn't there. It made me sad. I hate getting locked out.
I have to give my bio presentation at 3:00. It's supposed to be 10 minutes long but I doubt mine will be that long. I can't even talk for 10 seconds, much less 10 minutes. I hate presentations, but I guess you probably knew that already. I'm hoping that my presentation will be good even if it is short.
I might be going to dinner at 5. I'm really not sure yet. I have accounting at 5:30 so I might just wait and get a sub after class. I also have to do my english journal and finish my economics paper tonight. But if I get done with all this shit in time, I will go hang out with my awesome friends and Cathy will teach me how to play Blue Monday on her guitar. That is going to make me very happy. :-)

UPDATE:
The presentation wasn't as bad as I thought. I could have done better but I didn't die and maybe I'll eventually get used to being in front of people.

I know you don't want to hear this...but I honestly feel depressed right now. I also feel guilty. I really should go home and make sure my parents still know who I am. I haven't been home in 2 weeks. I'm out of food and money, so I probably should go home but I would be much happier staying here. I'm such a bad daughter. I also have to do my bio presentation which is due Monday. Maybe I should stay here and get it done. I know I won't get it done if I go home. I know I'm an adult, but I feel like I don't have control over my life. Is that crazy? Well, at least it's honest. So now I will work on my lovely presentation. I hope you all have a great weekend. 
<3 Kelly

I have a little bit of money saved up, but when I do go shopping I can't find what I like and want. Rugged Warehouse seems to have nice stuff, so I will go there. Until then, I will be a fashion failure."

Cathy and Kaleigh are awesome friends too.
They bought awesome CDs for me. Cathy bought Punk Statik Paranoia and Kaleigh bought the Vague single. I'm so happy. I have all 3 Orgy CDs now. They said that the CDs were a gift, but my birthday is 4 months away."

However, today got much better when I went out to eat with Kaleigh and Cathy. We had chinese food which was pretty good. I really like sesame chicken. I ate crab rangoons also. They are gross. I'm so sorry...I have tried them several times, but they are just gross.

About Room Selection:
I will be living in Mirse 207 with my awesome new roommate Stephanie.
Our suitemates will be Shavone and Shaytoria who are living in 205.
Cathy and Kaleigh and their suitemates will be living across from us in 206 and 208. 
It's going to be so cool! I'm so excited!!!

And I don't have to buy giant speakers now...yay for me! :-P
there's a story behind the speaker thing, just in case you were wondering.

Anyway...I bought a very cool CD today. VAPOR TRANSMISSION!!! Yay for me! Orgy kicks ass. They really do. They are an awesome band and they are badasses!!! LOL! 
Sorry...I am so obsessed with them. But they are awesome. So yes, I am very happy. :-)"

""They secretly have a thing for you because they find you to be dark, mysterious, and full of secrets, not to mention being the prettiest person in the world!"" ha ha...yeah right. God forbid that Donson ever liked me. I would rather have him hate me.

Everyone tells me that I'm quiet and sweet, which doesn't mean a thing in the real world. It's a lot better to be loud and funny (not that I know anything about it) because it makes people interesting. I'm not saying this for the sake of getting attention. The last thing I want is to be put in the spotlight. 

No one likes me because I'm boring and stupid. I can't even carry on a normal conversation. So now I am going to crawl in my hole and be alone forever. Goodbye."

It went ok, but I'm really not happy with my schedule for next year. There's not much I can do though. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I'm going to have an 8 am class. Business Law...fun stuff. Also, on Monday and Wednesday nights from 7:00 - 8:15, I have Advanced Accounting...blah. I would do so much better in Accounting if I could take it around 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning when I'm actually awake...lol. But at least I'll have a very cool roommate (Stephanie!!! <3) who will cheer me up when I am sad. 

here are my plans for the evening...I personally choose #3
1. do english homework
2. start studying for biology test on friday
3. hang out with my awesome friends (call me! 4-7-7-4)"

The reason I say this is that I wrote a possible part 7 -- It ends tragically so I don't think I'm going to use it. It's bad...very bad. I'll post it later so if you think it's any good, please let me know. Here's something that's a little less depressing...

<lj-cut text= ""quotes"">
these were taken from http://www.angelfire.com/band/orgychamber/ <BR>
People think I'm crazy for listening to Orgy, but their music is surprisingly upbeat. I promise! Well, not all of it...lol

""A lot of the lyrics aren't as negative as you might think. Downers aren't a part of this band. Uppers are more our style. Fuck being depressed, you know?"" - Jay Gordon, vocals

""[our music is] a collection of short stories, stories about parents, stories about good relationships and stories about bad relationships, different ways of thinking and everything told in my rather abstract language."" - Jay Gordon, vocals 

""Image wise, we are more influenced by Duran Duran, as they were always so stylish."" - Amir Derakh, guitar synth

""Basically I'm just a guitar player, but the thing is, using my guitar I have pretty much unlimited sound. By the next record, my setup's going to be amazing. I can only go so far at this point because, first-off, it costs a lot of money to have a rig like I do. Plus I've been feeling it out as I go along. It's a learning process, too. Not that it hasn't been done, but it hasn't been done in the way we're doing it."" 
- Amir Derakh, guitar synth

""Now we're much more sure of what we wanna accomplish and what our style of music is and what our way of dressing is. The first record seems like an experiment."" - Bobby Hewitt, drums

""Never give up, but be ready to go through some hell."" - Bobby Hewitt, drums

""People are people, man. If they're into us, we're into them."" - Paige Haley, bass

""Playing live really cemented what we are. It helped us to truly discover ourselves and our sound. And what we discovered is that live, no matter what we did, we couldn't keep down the fact that we are a heavy band."" - Paige Haley, bass

""You're not allowed to look like a normal person in Orgy."" - Ryan Shuck, guitar

""Kids need to start raising some hell."" - Ryan Shuck

<br><br>
You tend to ignore relationship problems, until they are too big to handle<br>

If someone does you wrong, you'll coldly and cruely break their heart
<br><br>
<b>Your ideal partner:</b>

Someone high status enough to bring you more attention - but not so great that they upstage you<br>
Makes you laugh and brings excitement to everything you do together<br>
Is aggressive and confident enough to butt heads with you every so often
<br><br>
<b>Your dating style:</b>
<br><br>
High expectations. You need to be impressed with an incredible first date for a second one to occur.
<br><br>
<b>Your seduction style:</b>
<br><br>
You like to make the first move - you're fearless about initiating things<br>
Passionate. You really get into any intimate act.<br>
Aggressive. Most of the time, you find yourself wanting sex more than your partner.

<br><br>
Try to not need so much attention. You'll feel less ignored, guaranteed.<br>
Learn to love your parnter for who they are - not how they help advance your life.<br>

"event","wow, it's been quite sometime since i've updated let alone checked this thing. anywho...here's what's new with me. i've been working two jobs this summer, enjoying both of them right now although i would like to find something else but for now they are fine. i like having mornings and evenings off when i can but i would rather have a set schedule. that's def one thing that i miss about college was knowing where i was goign to be and not having to make plans a few days ahead of time. 
i finally bought my own car, it's all my own :-D. it's a red 1999 pontiac sunfire. i absolutely love it. i had to have my mom as the cosigner but that's ok, it's still my car!!!
i moved out less than a week after getting my car. i picked it up on saturday and began moving my stuff out of my parents on tuesday. i'm now living on the other side of saratoga with my friend amanda whom i have known since i was in high school. we work together at rue which is cool too. it feels so good to have my own place and be independent and not have to drive back to my parents' every night that i'm out. the only thing that does suck besides having to pay bills of course is i have to get up a little bit earlier when i have to work at hannaford because it's now 20 minutes away instead of 5 but that's the price you pay when you move out. 
i'm definitely missing all my ec friends. sorry i never called you back michelle.....i miss you soooo much and now that i have my own place you can come and visit more!!! lol...:-P anyways i gotta get back to cleaning my room so i can move the rest of my furniture in tomorrow...lata"

Written by M. Carey and Babyface

I won't see your smile
And I won't hear you
Laugh anymore
Every night
I won't see you
Walk through that door

'Cause time wasn't on
Your side
It isn't right
I can't say I love you
It's too late to
Tell you
But I really need
You to know

No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby

Baby, can you hear me
Wherever you
May be tonight, oh
Are you near me
I need you to be by
My side

'Cause I never said goodbye
It isn't right
I should have said
I love you
Why didn't I just
Tell you
God knows I need
You to know

No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby

Somewhere I know you'll be
With me
Someday in another time
But right now you're gone
You just vanished away
But I'll never leave
You behind

I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories baby"

"event","it's been a really long time since i've updated this with anything significant that's going on with me. i rarely even write in my personal journal let alone this. there really isn't much worth writing about sometimes. i'm not gonna sit here and write about a typical boring day in my life. what's the point. i really don't care if people who read this know that i went to class today or that i have a paper due at the end of the week. 
I have almost three months until i graduate. June 5th at 11am. i can't wait but at the same time i am so scared. i dont' know what i'm going to do after graduation. do i want to start teaching right away or do i just want to relax for a while and stay at hannaford and get another part time job or something. do i want to move down to north carolina and get a job down there? it's frightening not knowing what's waiting for me. it's also goign to be so wierd not being a student anymore. since i was four i've been in school every september to june. what am i goign to do when that cycle stops?
to be completely honest though i am not completely afraid. i know that i will have to get a job and that i will be moving out of my parents house - to where though is a big question. i'll worry about that when the time gets closer though. i can't really do much about it until i have a steady job. 
im curious about what the palm reader in canada siad too. when i asked him about my love life he said that i will have to wait until i finish with my professional training which i assumed meant college. but what i'm worried about is that he meant grad school or even my phd. i wouldn't mind going back to him to see if things have changed. They changed with daved and nina so i'm curious. but i guess i will have to wait and see."

That saved a wretch like me....
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.
T'was Grace that taught...
my heart to fear.
And Grace, my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear...
the hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils and snares...
we have already come.
T'was Grace that brought us safe thus far...
and Grace will lead us home.
When we've been here ten thousand years...
bright shining as the sun.
We've no less days to sing God's praise...
then when we've first begun.
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,    
That saved a wretch like me....

i may be new at running a newspaper but i think i think i've done a decent job so far. i've worked my ass off and done everything that i could possible do without running myself completely ragged. i have classes to take, i have other obligations, i need a little time to myself here and there but i get the fuckign job done when it's supposed to be done. 
i also expect people not to give me an attitude about it. when things need to get done i expect nothing less than for people to do what needs to be done."

"event","it has been soo long since i have actually felt like a college student. the last time i took an actual class and had to write an actual paper was the beginning of last april. that's a long fucking time. i didn't realize what i have not been doing until this week when i have to start actually doing work. this is so wierd and i didn't think it would be this hard. i can't seem to find my groove. i dont' remember how long it normally took me to write a paper. i don't remember how often i stayed up late the night before something was due to finish it. the only thing i had to worry about getting done on time last semester was the newspaper. thankfully that is getting easier since i have a full editorial staff and more people are workign and writing for it. 
i have a paper due on thursday, a test on thursday, and a test of friday and then next thursday i have another paper due plus this weekend i have to work on the octagon cause we are scheduled to print for wednesday. 
craziness....."

"event","well it's a friday night and i'm sitting in my room doign nothign but watching tv. i'm actually watching the divine secrets of the yaya sister hood...good chick flick...it started making me think about my mom and her relationship with my grandmother and then my relationship with my parents....
the tuesday before i came back to school i got into a fight with my parents and finally told my father off. they keep treating me like i'm a kid and i finally got sick of them talking to me about responsibility. well i've just had it and i blew up at my father and told him never to talk to me about responsibility until he fixes the roof that is caving in around his head and his family's head. (our roof is leaking and caving in in places...it's been like this for a really long time and he has yet to do anything about it)
i've been thinkign about my childhood and the way that my parents treated each other and me and my sister. they constantly fought and i remeber nights where i would cover my head with my blankets and pillow and i could still hear them yelling at each other. my entire life i never felt love in that house. the first time that i felt love and really knew what it was was that night in april before i left for scotland when me nina daved josh and nicole were sitting on the monkey bars on the playground down the street from where nina used to live. it was that night that i finally realized that there are people in this world that actually cared about me and loved me. 
my father has never been able to express his emotions. he's told me my sister my mother and daryl that he loves us but i have never known him to say it and actually mean it. it felt forced every time that i said it to him
i was never physically abused by my parents but it feels like i've been emotionally abused. 
my mother never did anythign to compensate for my father....maybe because she never felt loved by her mother or something like that. she was never involved in anythign that i did or wanted to do. i'm closer to my mother than my father but i still resent her for all the things that she said that she was going to do and never did. i can't really be mad at her for failing at things that she wanted to do but i can be mad at her for making promises that she never kept. complainign and bitching to me about my father and expecting things to jsut fix themselves. she has never done anythign to better herself or her situation. nothing that has been realistic. 
i dont' ever want to do that to myself or to the people around me. i hope that everyone that i love and that i tell that i love know that i actually mean it and that it's not empty and emotionless. it's very hard for me to express my emotions but when it comes down to telling the people in my life that i actually love them i hope that i am able to say it and that they know that i mean it....that i really do love them and that love will never change. 
what if i had had a happy and love filled childhood? would i be the resilient, strong, independent person that i am today? would my love life be different? would my friendship with my divas be different?


all i hope for myself and for everyone else that i love is that everything that we hope and dream about and strive for and work hard for all come true and happen

daryl, nina, daved, josh, and nicole....i love you guys and i know that you know it...."

"event","wow it has been a really long time since i have written anything in here....it's always quizzes and brief stuff saying that i will write or update soon but i never do. 
anywho.......here is what has been happening:
yesterday was my last day of student teaching. i was teaching 11th grad us history regents and ap at corning east high school. my cooperating teacher and i got along really well i really liked workign with him. i took over the classes completely and he let me do whatever i wanted. it was really nice to have that freedom. you never realize how hard teaching actually is and what it takes out of you until you actually do it. your day doesn't go from 8 am to 3pm. it lasts 24 hours. you even dream about your students and your lessons and everything like that. you have to plan and grade and consider what you can do to help this student or debate what you want to do if this student acts up again and blah blah blah. you have to be constantly aware of your behavior and what you say in the school and outside of it in public jsut in case you run into a student on the street or in the mall or whatever. student teaching gives you only a small perspective of what it will be like to be a teacher and it's made me think hard about what i really want to do. ultimately i want to be a university professor of history. there are different paths that i can take to get there. i'll be graduating in june and moving back home (saratoga/albany area...not my parents house....omg that's another story). i have many options of what i want to do when i get home. i can start teachcing right away if i get hired or i can start teaching in the fall and spend the summer planning my curriculum. i can not get a teachign job and just work at some random place that has nothign to do with teaching or history. OR i can try to get a job workign in a museum. the last option is the one that i am considering more than the others. i've been debating in my head lately if teachign high school will be somethign that i would be good at. i dont' want to do soemthign that i'm not good at. i'm a perfectionist sometimes and i want to be perfect at teaching and i know that i won't be...not now at least. not at the high school level. if i could start off teaching college i would be in heaven. i don't like having to hold anyone's hand like you kinda have to do with high school kids. in college you just give them the assignments at teh beginning o fthe semester, lecturee during each time you meet, and grade the assignments (papers, tests, etc.) and give them a final and if the students dont' do the work it's their own fault and not mine. i jsut dont' know what i want to do.....if i had time to sit down and do nothign but plan my curriculum, one that i would actually use and know would work and be successful. i do know that i will continue to work on getting my teachign certificate. 
now on to the whole parent thing. so my great-grandmother is 94 and we dont' know how much longer she will live. personally i think she's gonna stay kicking until she's 100 but who knows...anythign could happen. also, my aunt colleen and uncle ed (who i haven' tseen in 7 years) are coming up for christmas from north carolina. they will be goign to vermont to celebrate christmas on new years weekend. that's when my parents, sister and i will be going up also. howeever, new years eve i will be in a hotel in clifton park with nicole, nina, daved, josh and a few others. i do not want to miss this new years. these friends mean jsut as much to me as my great grandmother and aunt do. they mean more to me than my actual parents do. i just turned 21 and my parents are still treating me like i am 16. they are telling me that i have no choice in the matter and that on friday when they are going up to vermont i am goign with them.  there is no reason why i cannot drive up to vermont on saturday. yes i will have been drinking the night before but unlike my alcoholic father i know when to stop. i know my limit...i have self-control. hopefully my sister will work with me on this and she will convince her boyfriend jessie to drive up on saturday so that i can still have my new years with my friends. 


who knows..........:("

so last night me and guv and michelle went to oneonta cause guv's parents live jsut outside of oneonta so we go and visit josh and then nicole randomly calls me and then we decide that we are going to surprise daved and nina by showing up in albany.....it was fun.......it was soo good seeing everyone. i miss them all so much. i wish i was closer to home so that i could do that more often but not much i can do about it now.

"event","well i'm in my third week back at elmira and student teaching is going really well. yesterday i taught my very first lesson and i'm getting along with my teacher, we talk about politics alot. lol. it's been hectic lately but tonight was stress city
i'm editor-in-chief of the octagon this year (our student/campus newspaper) so i have a lot of responsibility and duties and what not. yesterday i was in the office for six hours editing shit and getting all of our pages to the printer. it was stressful but not as much as tongiht. we had our meeting tonight and i also found out that both my sports editor and my arts& entertainment editor have quit because they can't deal with the pressure and the time that it requires to be a part of this paper. it's not helping that our business manager is busy as well and hasn't had the time to send out information about placing ads in the paper and whatnot. i also don't have any writers. no writers means no articles. no editors means i have to do the layouts. me doign the layouts means no sleep, poor lessons, and high high levels of stress. 
the former editors and everyone that has worked on the octagon that is still around talked tongiht about the paper and we came to the consensus that if we don't get the support that we need from the students and especially from teh administration (particularly in the area of compensation for our time and effort) the paper will diminish in size as well asfrequency. we are currently publishing a new edition every two weeks. it's gonna slowly go down to once a month if this pattern keeps up. the staff is going on strike.
i had so many plans for the paper and i expected them to all just happen and that hasn't helped. but all these ideas and plans for what the paper would be this year and i brokedown tonight because the idea that what i had planned CANNOT happen tears me apart. i only started working on the paper last year and even then i only wrote like five articles all together but being editor-in-chief i expected things to go exxactly the way that i planned. i expected more writers and more articles and expanding the news section to world and national news (news outside the campus) but because we are weakening in staff numbers and the administration refuses to compensate the editors through a journalism class or free credit hours or even pay like many colleges do ..all the plans that i had are not goign to happen and it's not a matter of it won't happen it's a matter of CAN'T HAPPEN. if it was a won't happen the i would have att least some hope but it's a matter or can't.....

i'm gonna look over our constitution and see exactly what i can do to change things so that the paper can at least survive to some degree but i won't be shocked if the paper disappears completely...no one cares...the administration mostly. i know alot of students who like teh octagon and enjoy reading some of the articles. but the administration and even our advisor dont' even say ""hey that was a really good issue this week"" or ""thanks for making a special issue for dean neal last year when he died"" or even ""thanks for all of the hard work and long hours that you editors put in...here's a coupon for $200 off your books for the semester"" the editors are getting shit for thier work and it's not even the octagon...it's the yearbook as well. none of these groups get any compensation for the work and hours that they put in. it's not fair and i am not goign to put up with it. 

today has just been a shitty day in general. i was supposed to be observed for student teaching today as well and the car broke down on the way to school this morning so we had to call a tow truck then wait for that then wait for a ride back to campus so we tookt he day off. then i found out that the issue of the paper tha twas supposed to come out today couldnt' be delivered til tomorrow and then i foudn out that i needed to resend a few pages cause they were screwed up. today has just been a really shitty day and all i want to do right now is go home and sit in starbucks with my friends and spend the night at josh's and not worry about all of this shit. i can't let this all get to me and stress me out or i'm not gonna be able to function properly for student teachign which is more important than any of this 

why can't things ever work out the way that i want them too"

"event","well it's that time of year again...back in elmira. i'm student teachign this term and i'm the editor-in-chief of the octagon and i am running for dorm council president and i'm tutoring and i'm workign for encore again so it's def going to be a busy year for me. i'm so happy with my room this year again. i basically have the same room that i had last year just two floors down so i only have to deal with one flight of stairs. it's been a hectic week cause of student teaching and trying to get settled in. i finally cleaned my room today and the only thing i have left to do in my room is get my dishes out of the box and hang up all of my magazine clippings and absolut ads and such. 
it's so good to see and hang out with everyone that i know here. i have missed them so much. i love the fact that this college is so small and that you can't help but know everyone and everythign that goes on. 
so the teacher that i'm workign with i really like. i'm teaching at corning east high school and i'm teaching 11th grade us history. i will eventually be taking over all four of his classes. two regents and two ap level classes. they all seem like great kids who are well behaved and have the capacity to do really well in the classes....if they do the work. lol. but the teacher i'm workign with is mr. hurd and we both have very similar points of view and opinions and classroom philosophies and what not so we are goign to work very well together. i'm starting to work on my planning and scheduling but it's a little hard cause of the type of textbook they are using. the periods that i will end up teachcing take up only one unit out of the nine that are in the book so timing is a little difficult. i have yet to see what his plannign schedule was laid out like and i don't want to screw up his schedule for when he takes the classe sback in december. i'll have to discuss all of this someitme this week. cuase once i know what topics i will cover for each day i can start writing my lesson plans. 
on the downside, my supervisor i think will clash with me and i know i'm not the only one. she seems like the type of supervisor where if you don't do everythign the way she wants you to do it she will try to make you change it and i can't do that. i have my ways and other teachers have their ways and you can't tell someone how to teach, they have to do it on thier own and all that fun shit. i'll make it through though. it is only 12 weeks but they are goign to be a long 12 weeks but at the same time it feels like its goign to fly by cause it is my senior year. 
so over the summer i started seeing this guy names josh and i'm sure that i havev talked about him before and most of you who read this know about him cause i've talked to you about him...anyways we saw each other the night before i left and we talked about us and we agreed that we were not gonna be exclusive and that we could see other people and so on and so forth. but the thing is is i really wish sometimes that we were kinda serious. i really like josh and i want to stay in touch with him as at least a friend but there are those times where all i want is to have someone next to me, holding me, kissing me. i miss those nights sleeping next to him. both of us constantly refer to the second night we spent together there on amandas couch watching fuse. we havev been trying to remember the exact songs that were playing and we have a few but there were so many that it's hard sometimes. i really want him to come out and visit me but it's hard cause he works two jobs so who knows. 
however, there are so many hot guys here that i would love to hook up with but if anythign were to ever happen i dont' know what i would say to him. like how do you bring that up with someone...even if you aren't dating but how do you tell someone that you've slept with that last ngiht you fucked someone else? and i'm not the type of person to keep that in and hide it. especially if you feel guilty about it? how do you even tell them if you don't feel guilty about it? how is something like that even brought up in a conversation. do i just randomly call him one day and say ""hi josh, how are you? oh i'm good especially since the night of hot sex i had on friday""...honestly???
anyways i havev to go to bed now so that i can get up at 5:30 in the mornign and go teach......nite all"

"event","sorry that i haven't posted in a while. it's been a little crazy this summer. especiially august. i'm working two jobs now....hannaford in teh mornings and the city tavern on caroline street in the evenings. i've also been seeing someone but it's been a little difficult getting together with him because of work and sleep but the time that i do spend with him i really enjoy. i just wish that all of thesegood things that are happening in my life would happen at the beginning of summer. i wanted a second job in june not august. i really wish that josh(the guy) and i had met earlier also so that we could actually spend the time tryign to get to know each other instead of trying to find the time to even see and speak to eachother. 
i wanna thank amanda for introducing us(in a way). i don't really expect this relationship or whatever you wanna call it to last when i go back to school but what's happened so far i wouldn't trade for much of anything. i might trade it for a new car but i would at least think about it first. lol....

i'm starting to put together a scrapbook of my pictures from scotland. it's gonna be sooo cool when i'm done wiht it. i have one more roll of film to develop but i dont' know where it is. i think it's still in my camera but i have no idea where my camera is. it sucks cause it the roll that i took while i was in st. andrews and i got some gorgeous pics of the ocean. i'll find it eventually i'm sure

only three more weeks and i'll be back in elmira. it seems like i have done nothing to prepare for student teaching...oh wait..i haven't....i haven't been able to really cause the fucking director of the education department never contacted the school to get me my textbook and other materials so that i could start thinking about what i want to do let alone prepare any lesson plans. it doesn't help that i haven't really looked at any history books this summer either but i guess i will just have to do alot of work in those first few weeks and borrow lesson plans off line. i'm a little nervous because i will have an entire class all to myslef for 12 weeks and this is def different than student teaching in scotland. for one i am actually teaching history and i'm not working with middle schoolers i'm workign with kids who are only a few years younger than me. it'll be scary at first but i just have to be dominant and stay in control and i will be fine. 

i'm doign really good with my tips from teh tavern so i think by the end of summer i will get my stars on my hips. i might even do it tomorrow with natalie if i end up hanging out with her. 

bedtime for me and hopefully soon i will update again and elaborate more on certain situations. ;)"

Deliberate Brutal Love Dreamer (DBLDf)


    Mature. Responsible. Aristocratic. Excuse me. The Priss. 

    Prisses are the smartest of all female types. You're highly perceptive, and confident in your judgements. You'd take brutal honesty over superficiality any time--your friends always know where they stand with you. You're completely unfake. Don't tell me that's not a word. You're also excellent at redirecting internal negative energy. 

    These facts indicate people are often intimidated by you. They also fall for you, hard. You have a distant, composed allure that many find irresistible. If only more of them lived up to your standards. 


Your exact opposite:
The Playstation

Random Gentle Sex Master
 
    You were probably the last among your friends to have sex. And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners. A supportive relationship is what you're really after. Whether you know it or not, you need something steady & long-term. And soothing. 
 

ALWAYS AVOID: The Playboy, The Loverboy 

CONSIDER: The Manchild"

<h2>The Aphrodisiac You Should Try Is: Honey</h2>
Honey is an ancient aphrodisiac... seen in the Kama Sutra and used by Cleopatra<br>
And honey is even the inspiration for the term honeymoon - where newlyweds drank honey wine<br>
Honey can be found as a the first Viagra in practically every civilazation!<br>
<br><br>
Sweet smelling and smooth, honey is perfect for spreading around naked bodies<br>
What you do with it after that is up to you!<br>
It's often said that the sugar and B vitamins from honey gives you energy to keep going all night...<br>
<br><br>
Try mixing your honey with a little nutmeg, a potion designed to heighten orgasm.<br>
Or mix it with ginger like the ancient Indians did for sexual potency<br>
And if you're looking for a kissable bod, try getting some honey lotion or powder

Religion - everyone has the right to believe in what they want. just don't criticise me for my religion or try to convert me
Children - i dont' like kids. my mind may change later but right now in my life i can't think about children. 
Occupation - if you dont' have a job or are not looking for one or are not making somethign of your life...keep walking. you need to have goals in your life and if you're not working for them then how can you support me in my work towards reaching my goals. 
Family Ties - i'm not close to my family except for my nephew. if you're close to your family then that's fine. everyone's relationship with their family is different. 
Level of Education - same as with occupation. if you're not workign for your goals then keep going. high school diploma is important in life in general and if you have your phd or whatever ....mmmmmmm.....lol...overall if i can't have an intelligent conversation with you then keep walking. you can have an intelligent convo without haivng a phd ;)
Pets - if you dont' like dogs keep walking. i don't like cats but any other pets are fine as long as they won't bite me
Personality - i don't like people who are dull and have no personality. again, i have to be able to have an intelligent conversation with you. sense of humor is a must. if you don't get the joke you won't have any idea whats going on. mostly though you have to be yourself and unafraid of what other poeple think. dont' judge others as well without judging yourself first. 
Music - you gotta love music because i listen to it all the time. 
Instruments - not necessary but will earn brownie points
Where to live? - preferably in the city cause i'm a city girl. i do want to move to the uk at some point in my life so that option has to stay open.  
Sexual Drive - oh hell yeah...you gotta love sex and not be afraid to try new things. keep me pleased and i'll keep you pleased. remember how to be romantic. jsut because you are in a long term relationship with someoen doesn't mean that you can't be romantic. 
Age - i dont' want anyone younger than me but no more than 7-10 years older than me
Vices - smoking and drugs are slight turn offs, don't ever touch my feet, dont' tell me what to do or smother me. i am independent so don't try to hold me back. get along wiht my friends or get out of my life. 

SUMMARY

i am looking for someone who will care about me deeply. i need someoen who will get along wiht my friends because they are the closest peopel to me in my life and i will not lose them over a guy. have an openmind and don't try to control me. respect my decisions and my beliefs and don't judge someones actions until you judge your own. if you dont' know where you are going in life then you need to think about where i will fit in. 
don't be afraid of who you are or what other people think about you. all that matters is that someone in the world cares about you."

"event","ok so i've picked up a few guys while i've been here, the first ones didn' exactly work out but i got a little action anyways there's this one cafe that we have gone to about three times already and on the third visit one of the waiters who had been flirting with me hardcore and staring so much i'm surprised that he didn't walk into a wall or chair or something anyways the third night we were there he invited me and amy (we're the bad girls but i'll explain that later) out for drinks at a pub just around the corner (apparently they go there after work alot) anyways we go and then we meet all these other people and it was this one guys bday so he invites us to go to another bar with them cause the one we were in was closing. so we wnet somewhere else then we went to this other club to dance for a while and that closed at 3am. it was a fun night and we didnt' ge5t any sleep whatsoever and it was a monday night so tuesday in school we are both trying to stay awake and teach 
so the more important information the hot waiter's name is brian but for some reason they call him joey becuaes there are like five different waiters and people that they all know that are called david but i'mgonna call him david....i like that name better. i had a suspicion that he was a leo and i was right. leo's are so much fun. he's a little bit shorter than me but i'm not letting it get in the way at all, at home that would never happen but this guy is so hot that i'm not gonna let a shallow thing like that stop me. 
the club that we wnet to was really fun it was called cube and was a gay bar...the guy who's bday it was was very flamy (he needed an entire bottle of aleve...hahaha) he asked me to be his faghag...he spouted shakespeare sonnets and hamlet to me and i melted omg. anyways david loved the way i danced....i tried to get him to dance wiht me the entire time but he kept backing up to check me out....he's a pretty good dancer too. nice arms and chest....good kisser too but it didn't go any further than that and i don't know what i'm gonna do tomorrow on our date....maybe go to 2nd with him but i'll save the good stuff til friday when we go to another club that we went to last saturday (b.lo) it was really nice but it'll be better with some hot guys to dance with. 
i need to stop spending so much money at the bars and start getting guys to buy me drinks and shit...i'm running low on money and the exchange rate is absolutely horrible. it's almost 2dollars for every pound. at least when i get home i will think that i am rich cause the amount of money that i will have will be double what i'm used to"

"event","So, got my nipples done.. A while ago actually. In fact, its been so long that i think the left one is growing out.. Whatever, doesn't matter.. So tomorrow i go in for surgery! Wheeee, two weeks off work, and all i hafta do is get mah' tonsils out. Yeah... so i'll be throwing up blood for the next few days, and not talking at all.. whatever, doesn't matter.

So, now the dirt. The interesting stuff.. Kelsey.
  I told her how i feel. Everything. I didn't hint at it, as usual, i came right out and said everything that was on my mind. She doesn't feel the same way. Thats fine, I mean, you can't expect love to work like the movies, right? But now we've got a better friendship than ever, because thats out of the way. Its pretty cool... tho, honestly, i'd prefer to have her as my girly.
  Kelsey has this friend that she met online.. And she's seen pictures of him, but never really met him or anything.. But you should see how bad she wants this guy.. She always talks to me about him, and how great he is, and how he writes her poems, and how he's so pretty... And i play the good friend usually, pretending not to care.. Listening, like i should.. She knows how i feel about her, is she just doing this to toy with me? *sigh* but anyways, back to the story. The boys name is James. He claims to be 20 or something.. but the other day he says ""I don't think i can talk to you anymore. I'm not the person from the pictures""
  Now honestly. If somebody you knew really really well, all of the sudden said that... you'd be angry, right? I mean, maybe you could be friends with them still, but it'd take a bit. They lied to you! This guy.. he's a 24 yr old Chinese guy named vincent. So she finds this out, and what does she do? She doesn't even care.. I think she beleives its some sort of a test he's putting her through.. I don't know what the point of this story is really.. It just pisses me off, because i'm a jealous person. I do everything for her. I carry things, i follow her everywhere, i buy things, i do everything i can to please her... and this guy.. He lies to her, and doesn't treat her like she deserves, and who gets the girl? Him. She loves him. I can tell by the way she talks about him.. Why do the good guys always come out feeling screwed over? I'm starting to think i should just swear off girls for the rest of my life...

I know i just sound like a whiney brat, but honestly, this situation doesn't add up in my head. I put my whole self into our friendship, and I know she's happy with me.. but fuck, the lying chinese guy gets the girl. Girls are stupid. No offense Julie, but girls really are."

"event","So, its happening. I'm getting pierced. Where tho? Where where where? I know what i WANT, but nobody DOES it! What i want is piercings starting at the top of my neck (see piercing, Nape) and then down my spine.. They'd reject, but they'd be cool for a while.. But nobody around here does surface piercing.. So, that being the case, its gonna be either tongue or nipples. Bryce wants me to get the side of my lip pierced, Steph wants me to get a tattoo, and Kels wants me to get tongue, stretched lobes, bridge of the nose, or under mah' lip. I d'dno.. I want tongue, cuz i know it heals in no time at all, and it'll be something to play with while i'm bored.. But it wreaks havoc on the enamal on the teeth.. My nips would be alright, tho i'd be getting them done different than everybody else. Everybody goes THROUGH the nipple, mine wouldn't technically touch the nipple. It'd be a barbell right behind the nipple.. Would be really painful, but its just pain, aye? If I could find a place to do that... course, they'd also do nape. If i could get my nape done i'd be content with that for now, but since nobody DOES that!!! Gurrrrr.. Well, we'll see. I might wait till i go to vancouver, and then i can get me spine done.. I'll post pics later!"

"event","Soooo... I bought a video camera. Don't ask me why, cuz i have no idea. It was an impulse buy. A 400 dollar impulse buy.. I've decided i'd rather have a $400 digital camera, so maybe i'll take it back.. Maybe i'll just buy a camera.. I'm so bad with my money.. Grr.. I'm trying to save, really! I know i need to save for when i go, but i just can't save money... *sigh*... Well, at least i have something to show from this paycheck. Usually it goes to rent, and lunches, and taking Kels out to dinner.. Tho i wish i could be spending it on dinner for Kels and me.. Thats the REAL reason for the post..
Okay, so, me and Kels have gotten really close (obviously) and I want to ask her out.. But I won't get to see her for a long long time, cuz her schedule changed, and now our schedules conflict.. and it really wouldn't be fair to her to ask her out if we won't even get to go out.. So once again, life dangles happiness in front of me, and pulls it away... Like those bad gag shows on TV, where they tie a string to a dollar bill.. yadda yadda.. Anyways.. Also, i guess its not fair to ask her out cuz she doesn't WANT a relationship right now.. I guess she could say no if she didn't want it tho.. Or maybe thats what i'm really afraid of.. I've never had anybody turn me down for something like that.. Prolly cuz i usually make sure they really REALLY want it. And I make sure. I make DARN sure.. I'll be spontanious.. Or maybe i'll just take her out on some more dates, and play the situation by ear.. *Sigh*
Okay Julie, what should i do? I know you don't like this situation, but you're still my friend, and you haven't yelled at me for this yet, so what do i do? What?

We were WAY early, so we went to the beach, and tanned, and I tried to help her study, but seeing as i don't know how to study, and I have NO attention span, i sucked at that.. And then we got some raspberries and blueberries and fed them to eachother.. Then the party for a few hours.. And then we went for dinner.. Excuse my language Jewels, but damn that girl for not wanting to be in a relationship.. Its not me, i know that, she just really doesn't want to be in a relationship.. I know thats a probably a good thing because of what happened to me last time i was in a relationship with her... but i am falling for her again. I know Jewels, i gotta be careful, and i know you're gonna worry.. But this is what makes me happier than i've ever been. I'm happy with who i am right now.. Church just makes me feel like a failure as a human, and i'm surrounded by all these people who just ASSUME that everybody is as good as them, and they make jokes about people like me, and i hafta laugh along like I think its funny.. I hate that atmosphere. Sure, i believe the teachings mostly, but the people..? They don't even know they're doing it, but they're so judging. Guh.. Well, life goes on.. we'll see what happens, aye?"

And they're okay with how weird i am, which is great. Theres tonnes of down time at my job, to just sit and talk, and surf the web, and practice writing backwards, and learn how to read runes, and look up rare diseases, and weird words.. So much fun. I really love my job, and i really don't want to quit, but i REALLY REALLY want to go to clinton wars! 
- - - Guh! Stupid Clinton wars... Its the last 2 days in july, first 2 in august.. thats a long weekend, and since i'm new, theres no way i'm getting a day off. Oh well.. theres always next year? Yeah.. And theres other events.. Its not so much that its SCA, its that i've never been away for 4 days without family.. Well, thats not true, i went to EFY, and i was away for 2 weeks.. but i was with nay, and at this thing i'd be practically alone the whole time. I just need to get away from everything and everybody, and find who i am.. Cliche, i know, but thats what i need. 
- - - What else.. Things with Nay are on the rocks. Whenever i ask her about us, she avoids the answer.. Its like 
""Nay, could we ever be together""
""Keep working on yourself shaun...""
- - - Maybe she's playing hard to get, but she knows i'm dumb about that... What i really thing is that she's using my crush on her to get me to ""fix"" myself. Yeah, i have problems, but they're my problems, and she can't just play with me to get me to fix them... 
- - - Maybe thats why i'm with Kels. She always liked me for who i was around her.. She knows more about me than anybody, honestly, and she never wants me to fix myself.. its just so great with her. Oh, and i'm not ""WITH"" kels, we've just been hanging around alot lately.. I want to be with her.. I don't know if i love her, but she makes me happy.. Happy in a different way than anybody else. Everybody else made me happy cuz i had somebody.. Kelsey gives me that, and she makes me content with who i am, and that makes me happy.
- - - Tomorrow (well, technically today) I'm going to a party. Kels is taking me.. Its after church, and i'm not saying what kind of party its going to be, cuz i know Jewels wouldn't approve, and she's the only one who reads this.. No worries Jewels, i won't drink, or go home with anybody who is drinking..
- - - Hehehe... I went out with Kels on Thursday, just to get away (thats what me and Kels do) and we went to the mall.. but first we thought it'd be fun to get a leash and collar... yeah, like goth kids do.. anyways, me and Kels walked all around both malls, and the super-store, and went to the movies with me on a collar, and her leading me around. You shoulda seen the looks we got! It was a riot. I honestly suggest every girl do that to her boy, just cuz its the most fun you'll have in a long time! 
- - - Oh... but somebody from church saw me on the leash, and they're prolly gonna tell me mummers, and i'm gonna get in crap.. oh well, my life, my rules, right? Not like i was doing anything illegal.. Still, i don't want her to think i'm MORE of a freak than she already thinks i am.. And no jewels. Don't comment on the leash. I know i'm a freak, and i can display it how i want :P

It wasn't hard, and he had tought us how to do it the previous day... Ugh, i just locked up... then i felt like i was letting him down... finally i cheated and asked one of the trainers who came in the room.. Well... i didn't ask.

I didn't cry on the phone call, but then it ended, and my teacher came and said i could go back to class... its like, a 30 step walk to get back to class.

I think that was my problem with helping people before. I wanted them to see what i was saying... but people think. People reason. People are unreasonable.. Unique.. What would work on me won't work on Nay. 
   Yeah, I just had one of those conversations with Nay.. The one where she's upset and i can't help and it usually makes me angry... But I didn't get angry. Nothing i said helped, but i tried my hardest, and what more can I do? At the end, i did resort to a ""reboot"" though... i told her to go to sleep, lol. Not exactly a reboot, but like a reboot, it can solve up to 80% of problems. I hope she's okay.. 
   She's planning to move a 8 hour bus trip away, so I won't ever see her... But she needs to get away. I don't want her to go, but i can't stop her. Anyways, this plan is falling through. Her room-mate decided its too expensive.. And thats the main reason she wanted to move, was to be with her room-mate.. *sigh* I want to help, but i can't.

   Anyways, like i said before, about Nay and Kori. Stop your worrying julie, Kori is 40+, so she's not another girl.. lol. Kori is a lady i work with who is training to be a counsellour. She's got a bit of work to go, but she's really easy to talk to, which is something lotsa counsellours need to work on. Anyways.. She made me look at myself, and see things i didn't really want to... I talked to her about Nay, and she said I don't hafta be depressed to keep Nay. (Oh yeah, another self-realization: I make myself depressed cuz i think people will like me more if i'm depressed.. I do get more attention, but do they like me more? hmmm) 
   So, as i was saying... I don't hafta be depressed to keep Jenae. Nay once told me that if I didn't need her, she'd disappear from my life... I took that to mean that I hafta be depressed, or have problems.. Kori made me see that Nay meant, as long as I need a friend. Everybody needs a friend, and Nay is my best friend, so i'll always need her. Kori also made me see that I can't MAKE Nay go out with me. I can't MAKE Nay do anything. (another problem of mine..) All i can do is tell her exactly how i feel. If she feels the same way, good. If not.. I can't make her like me. I'll still be her friend forever, but why use all my energy on trying to make something that Nay wouldn't want. Make sense? 
   Yeah.. Kori is a great lady.. Prolly my best work friend. There are guys my age, but they're..... um... ""Square"" I didna wanna use that term, but they just don't understand lotsa stuff. They're like Robert or Eric. They're good friends, but you canna really talk to them. Kori understands EVERYTHING i say, and usually she agrees. She's been through tonnes, and she's in my desired field of work. Counsellour. She's a great lady."

Or at least thats one theory, eh? Thats a bit of my convo with sky after she broke up with me. Other theories are like...
- I'm afraid that they'll end up leaving me anyways, so if i push them i don't feel so bad about it, cuz i was pushing them. They left cuz i was pushing, not cuz they hate me
- I don't want them to find out too much of what makes me, me... cuz lots of it is really personal, and old bad memories..
- I like being depressed. Having friends makes me happy. I don't wanna be happy.

Me and Sky are over. She felt that i wanted to break up with her, so she broke up with me. Lots of you will think ""she did that on just how she THOUGHT you were feeling? hmph!"" But breaking up with somebody by how they think i'm feeling is my signature move. I'm a jerk that way... i don't wanna be a burden or anything, so i just leave them before they finally get up the courage to leave me. Plus, she was kinda right. I wasn't sure if i wanted to be with her... I dunno.. I like her and all, just... i dunno... So ya, any hot single ladies out there, gimme a shout! lol..
   What else... Umm... I got a job! Oh yeah! I'm working at a call centre here in town. I canna say much more, cuz i signed something saying i wouldn't, but its a pretty good job. The training hours really really suck, but i only hafta stick with them for the next 2 weeks. Ohhhh geez, you should see my class.

Lotsa fun.
   Nay.. This is half of the reason i kinda wanted to break up with sky. I love Nay. I would do anything for nay.. She didn't exactly ask me to break up with sky, but i told her once that i thought sky was breaking up with me, and nay said ""Well, i think we both know thats prolly for the best"" So she didna want me going out with sky.. Eeeeenteresting... But yeah. She's movin to Kamloops for the summer, so i'm hoping and praying she won't meet anybody.. lol, is that wrong? No... I just want to have her all to myself.. Thats okay, right? yeah..
   Now, you may be asking me why i restarted my account... wellllll... With work, and sleep, and playing my new computer (new computer!!!) I don't go on msn much anymore... in fact.. hardly ever at all. And when i do, its after i get home from work, so its like... 12:40? yeah.. not many people are on that late, except the people i dun wanna talk to.. lol. Sooo i figured i'd start up my account so people can watch over me, even if they can't talk to me. I watch one of my friends accounts, cuz i never talk to her.. and if something went really really REALLY wrong, i'd wanna know. Y'know? so yeah... anyways, thats the latest & greatest!

I could tell her a billion times... i could show it through words, actions... She'd just forget, or ignore. She doesn't want to be helped... but then why would she try so hard to help herself? I'm so bad at this, its not her, its me. I can't fix her, but i hafta try, because she's my best friend. Then when i can't, i feel bad, she feels bad, i feel useless, and she thinks i'm useless. I am useless! No i'm not. No i'm not. I've helped people, i just can't help her... do i help people more than i hurt them tho? I mean, I bring Nay down so much, and take so much energy, and what do i give back? Words that don't mean anything to her... I should just stop trying... but where would that put her? At least if i try, theres a chance of me saying something that sticks with her, and helps her. Well... heres hoping."

Sky loves me, and i'm trying my hardest to love her, and in my books that counts as love... and if we're not supposed to be together then it won't work out. Yeah, i have feelings for Nay, but she'd never return them... Well, she told me once that she likes me, and i beleive she still does, but... I dunno, i don't think she'd ever actually go out with me. Today we talked about how it'd be if we ended up getting married, and I think it'd be weird... i mean, yes, i like her... but she's my best friend, and it'd be weird to switch from 'friend hugs' to kissing. Lol, she giggled tho, that was cute.. She said ""Why would you be thinking about kissing me"" and i said "".....i dunno....."" and she giggled.. Thats something Nay doesn't do. Giggle. She's kinda a tom-boy, y'know? Okay, well... we'll see how we're doing tomorrow, lol."

"event","Whats wrong with me? I mean really..? Like, i hardly let anybody get close, and the people who i do let get close, i push away. Then, i'm rushing into marriage... i've been wanting to get married since elementary school. Thats not healthy. Now i'm getting ""cold feet"" about Sky.. I mean, i like her alot... I want to say i love her, but i don't know if i'm even capable of love. I say i love her, and i think i love her, and i feel like i love her... but you should know, right? Like, if you love somebody there should be no doubt in your mind, right? I've never been sure of anything in my entire life. Well... i'm sure that theres something very very wrong with me, but other than that i'm not sure of anything. I wish i knew that i loved her... i want to love her, so much.. Does that count? I mean, if i want to love her this bad then that hasta count for something.. Whats wrong with me? I spent a day with Nay and i fell in love with her again.. Not like ""in love"" in love, but like... i would spend my life by her side in a second. No, i don't mean i'd marry her (well i would, but thats not what i was talking about) i mean that i'd just be there, by her side, for whatever she needs. Is that love? How are you even supposed to know?? Ughhh...!!! I'm depressed... seriously depressed.. It's been worse before, but i thought i'd left it all in the past.. I guess you can never fully get over it... I hate my life sometimes. I'd never kill myself, because theres too many people who ""love"" me.. Nay, Sky, Julie, Mum, Dad, grandparents... Chris maybe? Yeah, he loves me like a friend i guess.. And i just couldn't stand to make them feel as terrible as i know i would if one of them died. Oh well, what can ya do..."

I'm really insecure, so i assumed she was having doubts about us... Thats what i ALWAYS think when somethings wrong. I prolly need to see a therapist for alla my problems... My best friend told me that i should, lol. She was like ""I really think you should go to a therapist"" and she was dead serious. Prolly true, but i dun like the new therapist here in my home-town. The old one was nice, even tho she asked me if i was gay that one time.. We got along really well. Then she left, and this new one came to town, and theres something in her eyes that i just can't trust. Oh right, i was talkin about Sky. I'm not gonna worry about her leaving anymore. I know she loves me, and i love her. If she leaves, it'll hurt, but i'll hafta learn to live without her. I mean, she'll always be my friend, i know that, but i was afraid of her leaving as in not being my girly anymore. Not worried anymore.. Nope.."

"event","Things with Sky are... weird. Not bad, i can't say bad, cuz we're not fighting... she's just a little distant i guess.. I know it may not seem like much to most people, but heres how it is. ""Pretend that you've never been happy your whole life... everything you do has a dark lining around it. School, work, friends, family; nothing is untainted. You've been 'happy' but in the background you know that what you're doing is wrong (like when i was with my ex). Now... now pretend that somebody comes into your life, and they bring with them the sun. They lighten your life, help you live, and grow, they help you make choices... and they make you warm inside... Now, pretend that you might lose that person.""  Its all kinda obvious who everybody is in this scenario, lol. I'm me... Sky is the girl with the sunshine.. My ex? Well... different story. It has to do with my first entry..

Ohhh, and here's something julie said while trying to calm me down through this whole Sky incident.. ""You can always tell someone you love them, but there's always those special times where it completely truely sincere and the other person seems to know it"""

I would have rather had her yell at me, cuz then at least i feel that its somewhat resolved, but she wasn't mad, or anything.. Thats my lady.

"event","*sigh* Okay... So much to say. Nay and Julie started talking to Sky today... i didn't even know they knew her addy. Anyways, I told her about what happened between me and julie... ""What happened between you and Julie??"" I kissed her.. I'd like to say that she kissed me, cuz that'd be easier to get away with, but i kissed her... Actually, i'd like to be able to say that none of it ever happened, but it did. Anyways, so I think i lost Sky. Yeah. I know its my fault, but it still really hurts... I love her so much... ""Then why'd you kiss Julie??"" Well... Julie has never been kissed before, and she wanted me to be her first kiss. I knew it was wrong, yes, but i did it anyways. I've only kissed one person before Julie, and i just wanted to feel that again.. But it just felt wrong. I knew i shouldn't be doing it. I knew it was wrong.. Anyways, Sky made me talk to Jnay, and then we got in this huge fight, and i had to tell her (again) that us being friends was pointless. Then she called, and mum picked up... I told mum to say i wasn't home, so what did mum do? She butted into my business. She was like: ""Oh, shaun's gone to bed... did you two have a fight?"" And then, when she hangs up the phone, she's like ""Do you wanna talk?""
No! I already told you i didn't want to talk.. 
""Well you shouldn't have put me in the middle of it."" 
YOU ASKED HER! I didn't put you in the middle of anything!!
      Grrr.... Anyways, then Nay told sky what i had said to her online (which wasn't too bad, but sky has only seen me happy, cuz she brings out the best in me) and Sky was like ""I can't even imagine you saying these things... I mean, you're such a great person"" When i've clearly been telling her from day 1 that i'm a terrible person. She just refused to beleive it... Anyways, 3 friends down, wonder if i can screw up my life any more... Well... Prolly."

Julie told me she wanted me to hate her, so i'd leave her and we wouldn't have to be friends... and Nay? Nay doesn't care about me. Not as a friend, not as an anything. Yeah, it hurts, but i'm getting pretty used to losing people... Its funny cuz at some time, they each promised that they'd always be my friend... lol, oh well. This is why i told them ""You never know!"" but nobody listens to poor ol' shaun. He's has no life experience, he's just a joker, a clown. Doesn't know anything, or anybody. Yeah?

I hate the new year, cuz for about 2 months i'm writing the old year on alla my papers and junk. Yes, most people catch on to it sooner, and it only lasts them a few weeks, but i'm not all so bright, y'see? Hmm... well, hopefully this year is better than last.. Though, lotsa good things did happen last year... okay, last year wasn't so bad, but i'm still hoping for a better this year. New years resolutions...? Hm.. I'll stop being so lazy. Yes, thats right. I'll go driving, and get a job, and get around to filling out those papers so i can graduate (Stupid school lost the papers last time). Kay, well... Until next time, adios!"

I honestly can't figure it out... i mean, obviously its my winning personality or my rugged good looks... riiiiiight... lol. Oh yeah, I forgot! Also, yesterday i heard her voice for the first time. Nice voice too. She sounds a bit young, but thats prolly just cuz it was over the phone. Anywaysss... I'll post a picture if i can figure it out, lol.

Okay, her real name is Chantel, but I've always called her Sky, so I'll refer to her as Sky 99% of the time. Sky and me met about 3 or 4 years ago, and we had an off and on friendship, meaning we were really good friends while we were friends, but we'd kinda fade in and out. I've had a crush on her for most of the time i've known her, which is tough cuz she lives in Saskatchewan.. Yeah, and internet girl... But recently we've been getting closer. Like... we're not a couple, but we would be if we lived closer together. Anyways, a while ago i asked her to marry me, and she said yes.. until about a day ago, i though she was kidding, but she'd really marry me. I meant it, i want to marry her, but i thought she was kidding. Also, the same day i realized she wasn't kidding about marrying me, I told her i loved her. She didn't say anything for a while, so i made a stupid joke (its what i do in weird situations) and she told me to shut up cuz she was enjoying the moment. Then today she told me she was in love with me. Soo yeah... thats about all i'm posting for..."

No question with this problem, its just a problem.. I'm really starting to miss her, even though we talk every day.. I miss her because she's not the care-free fun childish Nay i'm used to...

Welll.. Okay, my best friend is J'nay, and I kinda have a crush on her... Thats a complicated situation that i'll get into later, but thats not the problem. The problem is that a week or two ago, she pressured me into telling her a huge chunk of my past, including the fact that i'm not... Dunno if ""pure"" is understandable enough, but yeah. I've done alot in my past that i regret, alright? Having ""relations"" is a big thing i regret... but yeah, the problem is that now she sees me as a totally different person... a worse person. Like, i'm not as trustworthy, and she sees me as less of a person, and she doesn't think i'm the same person i used to be.. I mean, if she wasn't such a good friend this wouldn't bother me as much, but as i said, she's my best friend and she's seen me go through mental, and emotional changes... and when she says that i'm different in a bad way, i really don't like it... it hurts... anywayss, for anybody reading this, i guess the question is... no, i dunno. Um.. ""Should your opinion of how good a person is change if you find out they're not a virgin?"" Okay, but don't get me wrong, of course you'll see the person differently, but... they're no less of a person, right?"

I don't really remember the last time I updated this thing, oh well.<br /><strong><em>Band is driving me nuts!</em></strong> I love and hate it at the same, how the hell does that work, I do not know. The show is good, the people are cool-for the most part, but yeah. It is just unfair some of the things that get done. If you let one person or group do something, let EVERYONE do it. Also, don't break up parts if you want to hear them, there is this thing called time delay-it sounds bad. Other than those two things, it is alright.<br /><strong><em>Theatre~Macbeth</em></strong> I forot about rehearsals on the stage side. Is that bad? It has been since 2003 that I was on stage stage for a major production. So this is interesting, fun, but interesting and amusing.<br />TBSPMA-yeah. Haven't really been to anything for two weeks because of rehearsal-so I have just&nbsp;about know clue what is really going on with any of it.</font>"

It was fun, my section rocks! But, it did take a total on my body thou.&nbsp; Waking up at 6:50am and then not going to bed until anywhere from 12am-2am didn't do wonders for my body; but I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />Classes for me today were alright, my first one being at 11am, second one at 12pm, and then band at 4pm.&nbsp; Not that bad of a day, then tonight I had a Phi Mu Alpha meeting-and then Wednesday,as of now, I have a Tau Beta Sigma meeting at 8:30.&nbsp; Tuesday/Thursday classes are going to be fun! Or not. My first class is at 9:30am, second at 11am, third at 12:30pm, fourth at 3:30, then sectionals at 7pm, and last song rehearsal at 9pm(Last two only on tuesdays) fun..fun..fun..<br /><br />This coming Wednesday is going to stress me out, it had better be a good day at band. I have auditions that day, and then the meeting, urgh.&nbsp; You know, I wouldn't be this stressed out if I didn't have to sing.&nbsp; A month ago we were told that we only had to try out for either MacBeth, or The ThreePenny Opera-or both if you wanted to. No No No.&nbsp; Now, last week, I believe Tuesday or Wednesday when I could finally get into the damn theatre department(Man. was waxing everythin) I found out that I have to do both, try out for both of them. URGH.&nbsp; I really suck at the whole singing thing, I really do.&nbsp; So, Wednesday is going to be fun.</font>"

Speaking of <strong>that; </strong>it now seems it will be <strong>even</strong> longer till I get one. After looking around the area, with the money that I will be able to make during Thanksgiving, winter, and summer I might have enough money for a somewhat ok car and maybe a month or two worth for insurance. So, I figure I'll pay off the one bill I have left-that I know about, I better not have any fucking more-and then my credit will start to get better again so I can hope for a loan or just monthly payments on/for a <em>newer</em> car.<br /><br />I've been thinking about the apartment up in&nbsp;Clarion a lot lately.

 this 4th of july wasn't very exciting this year. I didn't like it a whole lot. I saw the fireworks in a far off distance, and I could scarcly hear them....it made me sad. but.......i got to spend a little bit of it with my darling Erica, Brittney and Brianna. they are all so cute. This was the first time I'v seen the girls since Erica's birthday. But I was happy i got to see them last night. They were fun, they helped serve while Erica and I did dishes with this jerk, Kevin. He was al mean to the three girls but nice and all touchy-feely with me. eeeeeewwwwww.
  then the girls left around seven so they could go hang out with Chris, which Erica was totally thrilled about. Chris and Erica are soooo cute with each other. i hope they'll get married.....haha.
   but I was sad when they left. Brittney and Brianna wanted to live with me in the little hose that I stay in at work. I wish they would, and Erica too. That would be fun. 
    but........anyway, after the girlies left, I wondered around camp a little bit, then went up to the top with everyone so we could go introduce our selves to the new campers. It was crazy, but some of the kids had to go home because of pulling pranks on one another, such as....putting crickets in the cabins, itching powder in the sleeping bags, and messing around with ths kids expensive bed, since he's in a wheelchair. then some other kids got booted out for bring beer up here to camp. Yep, pretty exciting.
    Then, hmmm...oh yeah. Laramy or how ever you spell his name, well we hang out for a little bit. he kept telling me, ""You need a bed, you look like your going to fall over from being so tired.""
 and I was like,""Yeah, your right.""
      well, I gotta go serve right now. i'll write later.

i want to change.i want to be diffrent. not in a bad way, but in a weird...way...
 i cant explain it. my heart feels like its wanting to rip from me so i can follow it into a new path of finding a new me.
 why does it want this? why do want it? i dont know why. thats the thing i cant explian, and obviosly cant describe it in words.
 im feeling funny, just kinda tickly inside my body, i cant get it to stop. maybe its just me. 
 but every time i look at something, im looking at it in an odd perspective. like everything is slow-mow. like, when im outside...just looking at the sky, the sun slowely fading behind the grey shadows of the mountians,...its like thats the last time im going to be outside, or when the wind brushes against my face, its like thats the last time that will happen. ever. i just have mixed feelings all about it, like im going to luagh then cry, then wonder....
  i cannot describe this feeling. its too fake to be real, yet its too real to be fake.
  ughhh.............its frusrating.
     well, i gotta go. 
 happy fourth of july every body who reads this. have a good time and be safe too!

 well the campers are leaving tommorow. im so sad. i jut now tonight got along with thisreally ute kid, jeshua. he LOVES the strokes and the faint and a ton of other bands that i love.
  this is how it started:
    i was walking up to the assembly hall, and i walked inside, put my camalpack down then sat on this big table box thing. then like 3 mexican boys, one really stupid kid and jeshua walked up to me all at the same time. they were all like "" can we have your phone number?""
  i just started luaghing and they all looked at me like i was going to shoo them off, but jeshua shoved a peice of notebook papper in my hand and asked for my phone number. i gave him my email address instead. he wasnt so thrilled, but hey, what can a woman do? so he was gwalking away and i grabbed his sholder and asked if i could sit next to him. he just blushes and said of course.
  so i sat next to him and the  worship band started playing and he stood up n his chair and started dancing real funny. it was really cute. then he was totally flirting with me after that. i just giggled and smiled ay him and he'd smile and say ""what, am i ugly or something?"" 
   then, when the sermon started, i got out my scetchbook and flipped through the pages while jeshua was looking over my sholder, looking at my scetches. then we started writing notes in it. he asked me what my favorite bands were and all this other stuff.
 but yeah...it was really cute. i just wanted to kiss him on the forhead.he said when we got out of chaple that i reminded hin of his older sister who lives in alaska. he said that she knows everything about music and also said that she was a really cool sister.
   then, i walked over to my house then went with eric to the pool to watch the kids get baptised. and guess who did?
  jeshua!
   i was realy happy. hes really sweet and funny and.....gross in some ways.........
     but yeah, i have to go to bed. im so wiped out.
 goodnight.

 hmm.......well, erica left for summer camp in cali for a week, and i just applied for a job at UCYC (united christian youth camp) here in prescott. its crazy. i thought i would work for a couple of hours and then go home, but once i got here, they showed me the house i was going to stay at and the room i'll share iwth some other girls. i was like..""whaat?...oh my goodness! im staying over night!"" 
so, yup, here i am in the cute house filled with 10 girlies. its fun. tonight after all the camper kids went to bed, we celebrated a girls birthday, Kierra, shes a sweety, then we played this game called startripper. its so funny. you spin in circles, look up at the sky with your arms steched out, then some one tells you to stop and shines a flash light in your face, and you fall over instanly. its sooo funny!
   this house is cute though. the girls are thinking of putting us togetheron bunk beds, so im excited for that..if erica spends the nights over here. but all i did today was help out with the crafts, bb guns, and archery, then after dinner, i cleaned up the dinning area. but, this man who kinda runs things here told me that the crew members, (me) just volunter, but the kitchen staff9erica0 gets paid. but, i'll help with crew for a while, then when erica comes back, i'll see if i can work in the kitchen.
 but, this will be a fun experience.
 well, i don't have anything else to write about, so im going to go scetch a little bit while listening to morrissey, then i'll hit te sack.
 goodnight.

oh- and by the way, tis mine and bens 6 month anniversary today. yay! half a year and i pray alot more!"

'huh, cool, mr. deligadio (or however you spell his name, or say it for that matter..) is in the news paper!"" 
 then it twas in big bold print saying he died. it was so so sad though....but we will stil go...if it doesnt shut down, which would really suck..but yeah, aaany wayss....

 i had a great time last night. dimondbacks 8 points, san fran, 6 points you suckas!! hah, we totally whooped thier little fruit-cake behinds!
  it was a fun game though. i treid to call erca when we were there, but she was at church, so that sucked.
  aand i got some even better news!!
 im gonna work at that summer camp place with erica!! yeay im sooooo happy!!!!
  its going to be so much fun, i can hardly contain the excitment! its gonna be a good summer though, my george. it will be fun.
  well,.i dont know what to write next. scholls finally out. the last day of school..well it actually wasnt at school, it was at the snyders house, but i kept repeting alice coopers song ""schools out"" in my head. a great song to listen to at the final hours of the end of all your tourment. oh, and i wsnt feelin all that great either when i was there, and when we got home, i told my dad that i was gonna lay down for a bit, and i went into my parents bedroom to get advil cause i had a headache and i passed out cold right there on my parents closet floor. i dont know how long i was laying there, but dad kept calling me and he finally found me...but yeah...it was pretty excellent.
    yup.

 its been a long time since iv written in this thing. i was mad last time i wrote in here, but it faded after a while, and now im back!
  okay, an actual update.:
 the saddest thing happend yesterday. i found my birthday cake in the freezer at the church...two weeks after my birthday, and mind you, it was one of the worst birthdays ever, besides the fact that i spent it with my erca and i got a birthday kiss from my ben.
 but yeah, i came out with the box and said to my mom, 
 ""hey mom, look what i found..""
 "" Oh!,"" she exclaimed, ""i forgot that we didnt give that to you!"" 
  that word ""forgot"" gave my chills down my spine. this is what they really think of me, then. i thought to myself. 
 yeah, so that hurt....bad.
    now i just found out that erica's uncle died. she made me cry after i read her journal entry. i feel so bad for his family. for his two duaghters and his two little sons. they'll never get to see him agian, spend fond and fun memories with him. just look back on all that they did with each other. its the worst feeling in the world. loseing someone that you love so much, and then one day, unexpectedly, they're gone. and you cant see them agian, they're beautiful faces, they're sweet smile, the gaze in they're eyes. the voice that slips out of they're mouth, that makes you so happy and warm inside.
 thats why i never want to get in fights with someone that i love so much. just over stupid, pointless stuff. becuase if i lost erica and ben, i dont know what i would do. i dont know how i would manage, day after day, without seeing ben smile at me, just a loving smile and the gaze in his eyes that you can almost hear him say to himself, "" i love her sooo much."" and then it wants to make you melt inside, becuase your so overjoyed.
 or never listening to erica talk over the phone again. her sweet, smooth voice, that i cant wait to listen to evry day after school when im really beat. i love to hear her talk about what happend at school, or how she and we-know-hwo tickled eached other or were so sarcastic with each other. id die if i couldnt listen to her voice. not see her happy face after we fly into each others arms to give each other a hug.
  or to watch her wondering eyes scan everything in her view, how she looks at at something so pationalty, gives that object, that animal, that someone so much love and care, just form looking into her comforting eyes.
  i dont know what i could do without her.
 but i thank God everyday that shes in my life. and she IS alive.
  



okay, i need to stop writing anymore, or im gonna make my self cry....
 well, its the last week of school,...FINALLY. friday night, erca and i are going to burry our friendship box. im so so so excited!!!
  then ben and i are gonna hang out before he leaves for micighan....:(. im gonna miss him soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!
 well, i should go....
   im really tired all of a sudden. i think im catching up on my sleep since we've gotten out of the grand canyon. that trip was okay. the bottom was beautiful! it was like being in a jungle...minus the elephants and monkies....
   but it was neat. i dont think i'll go back for a while. but its nice to think that i actually hiked 10 miles and down and up agian.
 and once i get my license, im totally going back to seligman. the snow cap is the best restruant EVER. its sooo cute, and fun. everything is decorted with pottys and route 66 in the back of the building and everything inside is decorated with every holiday. christmas, holloween, easter, you name it, they've got it. but yeah..it was cool.
 well,hmmmm....i dont know what to write next, soo....yeah.

 one reason is because somone pulled a really stupid prnk on us. it was a long term prank too. stupid. we're really not that dumb. we can figure out a lot of things. you just really never know who your going to meet on here. you think they're really nice and you'd like to end up meeting them someday, and all they turn out to be are fakes and they're really shallow.

"event","today is probably one of the worst days of my life...
 i knew she would die someday..but i wasnt expecting it to be today.
 i was sick all night long and this morining. i slept in as my throat was throbbing. my mom came in to say goodbye and that she would call me later. i just nodded my head and mummbled ok. i heared her pulling out of the drive way. then i heard a scream. not even two seconds later i heard mom screaming ""NOOOO!!"" 
 i jumped out of bed, and ran down stairs. mom was across the street crying really hard while hugging bill williams, our consrtuction builder friend, since he's building a spec house across the street from us. then i turned my head. Dusty was lying on the ground. i gasped and ran back up stairts to put some pants on. then i ran back down and ran to Dusty. she was breathing slowely, her pathetic droopy eyes looking up at me, asking for help. tears streamed down my face. i ran to my mom hugging her. when we got back to dusty, she was...gone. dead. never coming back. i would never spend another day with my old dog. she was gone forever. i cired harder as bill hugged my mom and i.
 dad and wyatt got to the house. wyatt cupped his hand over his mouth and walked slowely over to us. mom couldnt stop saying "" ooh duddy, oh my poor baby. im so sorry""
 we got mom inside. then wyatt,dad and i walked back out. i asked dad if i could get her collar. he said yes. i walked down to dusty as she was wrapped up in some towels. i sat down next her, put her head in my lap and took her collar off. then i hugged her and stroked her head and kissed her face, underneath her eyes as i always did. i petted her head, knowing i was never going to get that greasy furry feeling back in my hand. dad was digging a hloe in the ground, under my bed room window, by the juniper tree. pine tree and oak brush. mom came out later. i kissed dusty one more time, so did mom and wyatt. dad picked up, carrying her to her grave as mom, wyatt and i followed. mom cried really hard, sobbing hot tears. as my dad laid her down in the hole he just mummbled, 'oh gosh"" and stared crying too. we all started crying harder as dad piled the soil over the hole. i saw the dirt civer up poor old dysty's wrpped up body, and i knew i would never see that agian.
 mimi and papa came over just a fw minutes after we burried her. they were crying too. we talked a little bit and mimi told me, "" Julie, when you were a tiny baby and you saw dusty, you would always point to her and say, ' thats my dog.'"" i cried again, thinking, i know, she was my dog. yes, dad did get her for mom exactly a year and a month before i was born, but she was my dog.
 so, in all of this, although i have shed many tears over Dusty, we know she wont come back. she was the greatest dog there ever could be, and we wont forget it.

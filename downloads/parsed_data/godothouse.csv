""It's like the city just wavers outside my daily routine. I walk these streets, thinking about being and time, not Heidegger, but the real thing. The lights just run around my path and snake into the future, where I just might reach them. I sort of hope not, the chase is half of the fun."""

"event","Living in the basement of a suburban shack, I find the grit on the walls to be more revealing than the layers of paint that I have slathered over this place.  Where do I go from here?  I can't bother falling in love with foreigners, they never return my phone calls.  How do I get home when there is no word order proper to that sentence? My chapstick is drying in my pocket, no reason.  My head cradles soft images of hair and head on chest and pillow.  Forget, forget.  Stand at attention and write bad letters that you will never send or read over crackling answering machines.  Pay attention to meter and walk the shore line to herald the dawn.  Speak in cliches and mean them.  Write choppy sentences without remorse.  Just go home."

"event","""one should, moreover, say <i>model</i> rather than <i>structure</i>""

What, throughout Derrida is meant by ""structure""? Is there a single coherent definition of structuralism? In the sense in which Derrida calls the ""representative determination"" a model (paradigm), is there any <i>determination</i>(substantive) that is not model (ideal)? Is not the very notion of a ""system constructed and functioning perfectly"" consonant with the transcendetal logos, and therefore is not all <i>perfect</i> structure abandoned? I may be simplifying but it seems that all Derrida is an ellipitcal, complex argument against rest, veracity, truth in the classical sense, (and thus is a metaphysics in reverse (of absence): all is the moving-one of the play of diff&eacute;rance) that is, a one-many, a synthetic unity that exemplifies itself in its very statement (it is undividable, unabstractable, and in this sense unexpressible; the completion that Pascal senses and attributes human inadequacy to).  The flaw in Plato that Derrida seems to argue against is the notion that somewhere, sometime, somehow, there is a logos (speech, words, a statement, account) that is not cutting, limiting, dividing or abstracting. He points out that language always fails us (though he would object to the moral in this ""failure""). Plato sees and is aware of this, but has a greek faith regardless, (although in a different way than in Aristotle's dismissal of infinite regress): he sees the wretchedness of the misologue, the aporia, angst and dissatisfaction, and opposes it to the eudaimonia of the philosopher. His faith then comes not from a simple ignorant sense of the good, his logocentrism is tied up in language itself, which whether <i>&eacute;criture</i> or <i>parole</i> (to rephrase Sartre on nothingness) adds a shimmer of truth to all things. Language seeks to put things at rest through the as-yet uncovered mystery of the copula ""is."" And it is not enough to reduce this to evolutionary convenience (substantiation, declaration, logos as <i>power</i>, mind-power or sexual prowess, aggression). This interpretation itself falls victim to <i>Macht</i> and is as old as speech itself (but finds its greatest known expression in Nietzsche, Freud, Foucault)...

An elitism of decay, a private club of self-destruction reigns. Only I can die, only I can live. angel's trumpets. devil's trombones."

The space between here and there is up for grabs and my thumbs have fallen off, so I traipse precariously across the past with my arms held in an anticipated embrace.  What kind of anonynimity can I expect when i take off my clothes in public, show my peripheral vision to the spectators?  What if there is a blemish on my back that I cannot see?  Will it have been better to have left my clothes in place, maybe wet them a bit.  Of course, I am not sure.  I waste words in the ether."

Nothing ever happens here.  Banter.  Irony.  Liz (who has been quiet as of late).  Uncivil activity from one of the members, or two if a pun is intended.

At the house of sam a milky thigh served us a burrito, and fast, too.  Some of us weren't there, but the milky thigh sure was.  

It is better not to do anything when the chance arises.  It is better to just distract yourself by talking about Liz.

We have also determined that the constitution made sense after all, though it turned out that a founding father didn't like it so much.  In short, beer was spilled and porn enters into any healthy relationship, and currently does very much so: how do you think we found Liz?

I like the three of us alone here, lying to no one out of necessity.  We can talk of past love or recent and rediculous crushes.  I tell the stories of last semester, my confessed crushes and the folly in which I conjured them.  I have made my mistakes and in the end my aplogies will probably not mean anything, but I will make them, maybe in vain, maybe in love.  I can't quite make out the rest of the year with these fellows, the tests our friendships will traverse, the failures that i will betray.  I want this to be titled ""maybe""."

"event","&nbsp;The year is 2007. There has been 2007 years since the birth of christ. Long time for people to still talk about someone.
I would presume I am not nearly as important as Jesus though. Based purely on how long it took many people to forget about me. Yup, it's true legends die, even the living legends. In the three short years since my last actual post I have gone thorugh manycircumstances and explianing the differences and occurences would be a waste of everyones time. The most major event though is some thing I may reference from time to time, which is the recent year I spent abroad in Germany. It went like this, imagine life being almost unbearable everyday, then all of a sudden everything is exactly how you want it to be. You have everything you need to be happy. Then after and a little while, just enough time for your new life to soak in, you leave it, not because it is a choice but because there is no choice. And when that life ends it is replaced with a world that has forgotten and does not care to ever recall the past which took so much work to build. That was the last year few years for me.
Now, don't get me wrong, I am fully aware that no one is reading this. I hold no dilusions of my own importance.&nbsp;
Since my truimphant and uncelebrated return I have been working towards rebuilding a former life without the negatives that it had. Well, all I could find where the negatives really, and hardly and of the people I knew could I call a friend.&nbsp;
Life goes on though, so, big deal. I learned a lot in life and one of those things is that I shouldn't give a damn. So, yeah, I dont give damn.&nbsp;


So damn it all."

And thats all I have to say about that! 


This weekend I had one hell of alot of work to do, I mean seoursly. I had to create a world, and write an entire report on Elizabethan Swordplay. I did it though and still had time to hang out in gardiner with my good pals HannaH, Matt, and Corinne. That was fun, we had lunch, went to the store, watched kill Bill, listened to stuff, made sexual comments. Discussed a nice play over the summer.

and for those of you in the area who are interested:

This Wednesday, that of may 24, at 6pm, is an informational meeting concerning a production by The Waking Dreaming Theatre Company, an original prodution. At the gardiner Commons (""The Park"") at the Gazebo. All planning on auditioning are requested to attend. Auditions shall be thrusday, June 3, 2004 at 6pm, also at the gazebo of the Gardiner Commons. 

I have'nt hung out with Corinne and Matt in a while so it was lots of fun. And of course HannaH is always a joy to be near. 



Now for the depressing stuff. My mother doesn't seem to want me any more. She is selling our house and forcing my brother and I to live together in a small two bed room apartment. This means she will be able to lively happily ever after way up in her other home, living her other life, without children. I am feeling very abandoned, alone, and generally bad. How can some one give up on raising their kids? Living in the apartment won't be easy, if you have read my past entries you will know the contempt I have for my brother, living alone with him will be plain awful, he will probably never allow the phone to be used by anyone but him, he is really messy, just leaves half-eaten meat ball dishes lying around. Which is a great thing for a vegetarian such as my self. I probably won't be able to go anywhere outside of the immediate agusta area until I get my license, which is still a ways away. I have a tendency to ignore my problems till they get so big there is nothing I can do, I think that is exactly what I am doing now."

But why you ask is it an end of an era? Well, it isn't but in order to get your attention as readers I needed something catchey. So now your attention will slip away.................. CONTRASEPTIVE!!!! There I have once more. This is like juggling, only I am not really good at juggling. That reminds me of a story, it was when I wrote a pointless Live Journal entry and nobody commented or cared.

"event","I am in drivers ed. and doing quite well I think. I was just out on the roads and manged to parralel park quite nicely, and switch lanes going down western ave. Ok, so that doesn't seem like all that great of a task but I think it is a reasonably large one. 

I have a new hat, yes a new wonderful hat. Now normally I wouldn't mention something as trivial as a hat but this one is special. It is a hand knit red and black hat. Hand knit by the HannaH Frankel. I must say it is one of the greatest hats I have ever owned. I got alot of wonderful comments on it today as well. Anyway enough of the hat.


I am in a better mood lately, and I think I know why. It is spring and with spring comes summer and with summer comes:


A complete lack of school!

Theatre in gardiner with Matt!

Spending countless hours in downtown Gardiner! 

A possible job at a Black Smith Shop!

HANNAH FRANKEL and a whole hell of a lot of wonderful days with her!!!!

Staying up into the wee hours of the morning just because I can!

Tree climbing!!

A driving permit!

FREE TIME!!!

Eating icecream when it is actually warm outside!

HANNAH!!! AGAIN!!!

Yes it appears that summer is certianly the best time of year for a teenager. And, as a teenager myself, it is a great time of year. Not long till then either, not long at all. And a message to Matt, WRITE A PLAY ALREADY!!! Ok, so you usually write it as we go but I think it would be better if you had time to edit it and make characters more believable, but I know coming up with plays is hard. I have to write a play for my theatre class and I just came up with my idea last week. I will have the script able to read if I am proud of it. Well, I am gonna stop writing for now. Later dudes!.....sorry about that, Bye."

Line is here, she is really cool. Lot's of fun. I brought her took a rock show, that was fun. I had not been to a show in a long time, I think I will start going again. 
Yesterday we went down to portland to meet some people at the mall. I don't really like malls so Anna Pilsbury and I spent our time either in the massage store sitting in the chairs, or just walking around. 
That night was a party for the Germans and there partners. It started out slow but then Anna, Bobby, and I had the idea to collect all of the red balloons then dance along to 99 red ballons. So we moved all the red ballos to a corner. Then we moved into a secret hiding place and discussed our plans. Eventually we found a new hiding place, we liked it better because the lighting was red. Eventually we figured out the people who were doing music didn't have the needed song so we got all the german students who knew it to sing it. We tied strings to the helium balloons and tapped the others to Bobby and froliced while the germans sung. It was fun. I think we did a good job of making the party worth while.


But...

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH........

Russell had talked of suiduceing Line before she got here but I figured he would be decent enough to just leave it at talk. But no he has to lose all his diginity. He has been shamelessly hitting on her. It's pissing me off so much, I don't care if Line finds a boyfriend her but Russell is being a complete asshole. He was my one reservation about even appling to the exchange, and sure enough he has pulled through as the biggest fucking ass hole alive. I can't ewven do anything about it, if I say something he will just laguh and do it even more, but I hate just sitting and watching him do it. This whole experiance would be so much better if it wasnt for him. AAAAAAAAAAAHH!! If any body knows where I could hire a good assasin please tell me!!"

 Chizzle Whizzle ball was tonight, and I didn't go. I didn't want to though so don't feel bad. HannaH said she didn't want to go which suited me fine. Buying crosashes, tuxedoes, dinner, tickets. I might go to the ball one year but I won't do any of that crap. I had a bad experiance at homecoming though.

Well my computer is on the shits so I'm gonna go."

"event","Hello good people.

I'm sorry that I still dont post to often, the play is over so I guess I don't have to much of an excuse, not that anyone has any real need or desire to keep up with the events in my life. 

Well I am wearing belts on my arm. I spent a nice day yesterday with HannaH in Hallowell. Interesting, eh? Well, I like it. I was recently lent a book on ""exploring witchcraft"" I don't really have any desire to become a practitioner of magic but it is interesting still. 

Today the school struted it's pointless pride in itself. Crazy red and white day... One of those things that high school sucks because of. They are ussually acompanied by cult like ritual of a pep rally. Thankfully the majority of these are not mandatory but todays was. Yet, when things are mandatory and incredibly awful there is always another way out. Skipping. Steve, Julia, Emily, Brian, and I left out of the student parking lot went dwon the street and hung out behind a building till school got out then we all went our seperate ways, I to my bus. It was really fun though, I am not one for skipping and being pointlessly rebelous but I enjoyed this. It wasn't any big thrill to leave it was fun because of the people and stuff. So that was the main event of my day.

Well Molly Ladds birthday party is sunday. I FINALLY GET INVITED TO A PARTY! Ok, I might be a bit to happy about that, but I am a big loser.

Well, I just realized that I have started pretty much all my paragraphs with ""Well,"" and that I have nothing to important to say, well nothing that comes to mind."

"event","Today HannaH came to my house at about 11:40, we are kind of in rough waters now because we are both really antisocial as of late and we are having trouble talking, I think it is more my fault. I have, as of late, been feeling completely and utterly out of place. It is as if there is no place that I can truly relax or be myself, I'm just going through the motions and not really living. Or as HannaH put it, I am like the earth, and the sun is everything that matters to me and I am now slowly spirally out of orbit, watching my life but not truly living it. I seem to have lost all hope for the future, for mankind, and for me. I can not even carry on a conversation for more then a minute or two. I just don't know what to say so I end up depending on the other person to say something, and they end up walking off, for someone more interesting then me. It is as if I am living just to die."

"event","Well, here I am again, sitting in my grandmothers house. 


I'd first off like to apologize to Corrinne, for three things.
1. I didn't mean to make it seem like I don't like that you are here, in fact I really do like that your here. You're one of the coolest people I have met in a long time, please don't hate me.
2. I am quite positive I spelt your name wrong, sorry.
3. I am sorry I could not make it wendsday, I had rehersals and they lasted longer then I thought they would.

Vacation has been fun. Ok, not really, it's been boring long and I have no life outside of HannaH. I'm not complianing she is the greatest person EVER! But I can't spend all my time with here, mainly because she actually does have a social life. 

So Evan Martin has shown me the wonderful world of animation, I posted two of my works on newgrounds.com but both got shot down. It is kind of upseting but I just started and so it's not to bad. One of the cartoons was a politacal animation about animals, most people gave it a bad rating because the sounds wasn't good and they don't like my message, but those who did like it gave me a good rating and some good advice on how to make it better. My other animation got better ratings, it was a musical piece, kind of sad and gloomy, some people liked it and scored me good, along with good advice but there were more people that just wanted a funny, voilent cartoon. Oh well, I'm working on a really good one right now, which I want to go back and revise some of.

I have felt really out of place lately, not just at school but at home to, I don't seem to fit anywhere. Ok, that sounds whiny and very teenagery but oh well.


See you all later, or the four people or so who read this."

"event","Hello agian all, I'm at the office now (suprise suprise). Well let's dive in. 

My largest personal worry at this point: Matt Bear-Fowler. I don't mean to bash Corine, to whom I do like, but it's been quite different sense she has arrived. Matt has always been a bit shut it but he would always wake up and go places to see us. But on sunday he cancelled our plans because he wanted to sleep. They have been sleeping all day and staying up all night, I don't object to this but it is a quick way to lose all your friends who don't work like that. Matt also seems to be getting less done, I know he can't really get a job but for the past two years he has written and put on plays, I sinceraly doubt he will this year, and if he doesn't then last years will probably be the last. This being very disappointing becuase it literally was my life for the past two summers. He also has a book of mine I really want to read...


The augusta school board wants to cut all non essential classes for next year. Meaning no mythology no creative writing no journalism no computer classes. Basicly making the school the dullest place on earth. I will find a way to stop it, some people and I are tossing around protest ideas.

I'm going to books and flicks soon, I think I have nothing else to stay right now."

"event","How many people can guess where I am? My moms office! WAHOOO!!!... I am leaving at two of clock to see HannaH. I'm not sure what we will do but it will be fun, garanteed. She may bring a Hall-Dale person or two or more, depending on her mood. If she does we will check off something on our ""To do this year"" list. We made it a while back, we each chose ten things to do over the year and we shall attempt to accomplish all of them. After I return home I may or may not be going somewhere else, the people aren't wonderfuly dependable. Saturday shall see me at my fathers home, and a family birthday party for Russell. I hate family events, I can't talk to anyone. If somebody attempts conversation with me they use one of the following lines:

1. Are you in any plays right now? (most common, my family asociates me with any kind of dramatics, my only known hobby.)

2. How's school? (The old standard.)

3. What do you want to do when you're older? (Not ""What will you do when you're older?"" As if my failure is already fated.)


And as if my failure isn't completely sure already I have just gotten the college talk, about two years early. Evedently my mother has no doubt what so ever that I will pursue an acting career, I won't. She also believes the sooner I am positive what I want to do with my life the sooner I can choose a college the sooner I can prepare for that college and impress them the better chance I'll get in the better chance I'll make more money (oooh money...) the better chance I'll be famous and rich and happy, and if I don't decide my future now I will die poor and lonely. Poor, most likely, lonely well I hope not. I am more worried about who I am now then who I will be in twenty years, not that I will live that long, the end of the world is in 2012 and all. 

I think I support Dennis Kucinich in the election, mainly because he is the only one to have an Iraq exit plan. My brother came into my room the other day and told me that i am now supporting John Edwards, I think, who ever Micheal Moore is supporting. That was Russels justifacation for it too, ""because Micheal Moore supports him and I'm for whoever he is."" Way to think for yourself Russ. When you first meet my brother you may think him to be a free thinking liberal guy, wrong, he buys all his clothes at hot topic, he enjoys cars, cars, skateboarding, and being irratating. His ideas are all spun off of far more intelligent actually independent minded people. Every once in a while he tells me I'm ignorant and don't know what I'm saying. I may only be 15 but I think I'm fairly intelligent and I don't have a tendency to talk of things that I don't understand. He also has the tendecy to put me in a bad mood with whatever he says. Even the sight of him puts my mood a few notches lower.

"event","First off I'd like to correct my last music selection. WILLIE NELSON SUCKS! Not to be critical but the songs are dull and he just can't play guitar. 

Second off I would like to thank HannaH for such a wonderful coed sleepover on saturday. We made curry and went to the air port, ok so the airport its self wasn't to great but we picked up HannaHs brother and mother there. Surprisingly enough it didn't really feel like I was intruding on a family event. This, of course, makes me quite happy, I'm being accepted as a Frankel, well kind of. 

I have been given the role of Interviewer in my schols play for a regional theatre competion. I don't think I'm well suited for the role but I'm working on that. The role is kinda neat in that the character makes everyone he talks to confront a part of themselves that they have not confronted before. I also am quite proud of HannaH for getting a major role in a play at gas light. 

I left HannaHs at noon on saturday, curry in hand, from the I went to clinton, made a good old soup, and watched the movie ""Under World"" It was alright. I then watched a really awesome movie on the history channel. It was a movie which was the story of Attilah The Hun. (To whom my mother believed to be female) It was great movie but I had to miss the end so I could go to augusta. Where I went to bed, woke up did my showering routine and had lunch at thai star, spicy bamboo, very good. Which brings me to here, my mothers office, sitting at a person desk to whom I have no affiliation. 

School is dull, I am supposed to help out with next symkesters mythology class but I have the disinct immpression that that will fall through. I did however gain entry to an advanced cooking class without taking foods 1. Mid terms are next week, I haven't really studied yet. Though I am not very nervous. School gets out early so that will be good. Next semester starts after that, it should be fun, I have intro to theatre with a boat load of cool people. I just sent an email to my exchange partner in germany. Hi Caroline! She will be here in March. 

I wish I could vote, this election won't probably turn out to well, another four years of our good old texas terrorist. All I can really do is find out who can vote and plead with them to do so for a democrat. Did you know that the only two animated disney films with boths poarents present in the movie and they don't die throughout the films is 101 Dalmations and Peter Pan (Wendy)? 

Best of luck to all, and I am sorry for not posting more often."

I've been struggling with the idea of christmas for a long time, like most people, so this year I'm making most of my gifts. So last monday I stayed after school to pick up fabric and I was getting picked up downtown, which is not a long walk from Cony. Lets just put it like this, cold, no money, standing on the sidewalk for an hour and a half. I got the flu. I have been sick fo 5 days, though now it has reduced to mostly a rough cough. Started with a head ache, progressed and I eventually couldn't get out of bed, only threw up once though. Well, I missed the holiday party like event at Matt's house, ok so it wasn't a party just Matt, Corine, and HannaH, damn. 

I am got into the regional theatre compition I am the interviewer, a voice from somewhere of stage. I was one of two guys who auditioned in a 2 guy 7 girl play. I think if the other guys who usually do theatre tryed out I wouldn't have a part, but they are doing Chizzle Wizzle, Conys pride and joy, the longest running high school theatre presentation, the thing teachers stop giving homework for and every excpects you to participate in, theatre for jocks. They always have the stupidest themes, food was last years, this years is chizzle wizzle goes west, the year before that a day at the beach... in the 50's... what the hell? But that's not really important.

HA! Does anybody else appreciate the irony? The cows get slaughtered, torn to peoces and devored so they go mad. There are now mad cows in America,and its already been eaten, your meat as safe as you thought? Saddam Hussien is caught, I'm split about it on one hand it is one step closer to the end of the oil war, but it will also help Bush in the election of 2004, please vote against him... please...

I AM DATING HANNAH! I AM DATING HANNAH! I AM DATING HANNAH! We have been dating ever since november 11, yup that's right vetrans day. It happened through a long process, I had been asking her for a long, long time so that day she commented on songs and certian memories. So I played a song, sang along and then asked her, she said no, so I did the same with another song, she said no, and then the same with several other songs, she said no. So I improved a song with my bass, she said no, I improved a song on my mandolin, still no. So she asked why I wanted to and I explianed, then asked, and she SAID YES!!! It's been just about the best month of my entire life, I love her so much. HAPPY HAPPY. Oh, we don't plan on telling our parents, if we did we would have no chance to be alone together, so if anyone who reads this could take that into account.

I auditioned for the regional theatre compition, I did ok I think, only 4 guys are auditioning so I will probably get in. We gave HannaH her Puppet last thursday, I also had yet to see it. It's incredible, the man who made it modelled it after HannaH and did unbelieveable. The hands even have finger prints. Scott Radke was our artist, his puppets are wonderful, kinda creepy and erie but still wonderful. Everyone needs to look at his stuff, I forget the site though. Life is generally good Holidays are coming up so I am making all of my gifts. It feels good to make useful stuff for people. Holidays should be ok, I don't usually have good one. My impression of christmas has been forever traumatized, my parents split 3 days before christmas. So it has never been a fun time of year. Well I have to go, bye."

     On other subjects, HannaHs birthday was thursday, thanksgiving, so I couldn't see her then but we had a small party for her at my house on friday. It was great, not the big event we were origanally planning but it was super. The party goers were myself, Matt and Corine, the only two people on my friends list, HannaH, of course, Zachary Snowden, he is not a very social guy and I'm surprised he came, good for you Zach. He honestly worries me, instead of going out and living he stays at home and watches tv, plays video games, and paint small plastic figures, I scared that pretty soon he won't be able to find a way out of his current life, we have been friends for a while, it concerns me. I have plans to get him out the, the party was a step in the right direction. I know some people with cars that are willing to get him out and  experiencing  life. Also at the party is Jon and Erin, a nice young couple, ok they are older then I but still. They were both in my summer play ""Steal Fire"" directed by Matt, also there. Nice people. Thats everyone. It was great fun. Best party I ever threw. That's not saying much last one only 1 person came out of the dozen or so I invited.

HannaH, HannaH, HannaH. We are super, she is super, I don't mean to brag but I'm just really happy that I have got such a terrific girl. She is just, wow."

I know this is stupid to wonder but it's important to me. I've recently turned vegatarian and that's fun. The food is great. Well, I have gotten a couple people to swear not to buy Procter and Gamble products on the grounds that they kill and torture animals. Such products are Hawiian Punch, Dr. Pepper, and pringles. But it just made me feel that I have made a slight difference.

I SEE HANNAH TODAY!!! I adore her so much, it astounding.

Well here's the biggy. Yesterday the school had an assembly about veterans day. They had 4 veterans to speak. The oldest man was in korea he is also a member of Veterans For Peace, a really great orginazation, well he talked about his orginazation and then he said he had to peoms he read the first one it was about a man who shot another man, then began to think that the person he killed was similair to him, out of a job, with a family, no where but the military to realy go. And before he got a chance to read his second peom they cut him off. The others talked about how great america is, that they are proud and blah blah right wing crap. They all also got much longer to speak then the man with Veterans for paece did. Not to mention when I refused to stand during the national anthem teachers forced me to stand. One person was threatened with suppension if she didn't stand. It's so awful they can't make us stand. But of course according to the constitution we don't actually have rights, people under 18 aren't realy people.

My internet is still down on both computers and fixing any of them seems gloomy. Sorry once more. My medical health is improved. I'll be going to surgery soon to fix the perferation in my ear.

I've been trying and suceeding for the most part with home work and school but it's hard and I don't know if I can keep it up, I've always had a hard time with school. But I am doing theatre at school and I'm in 2 plays, Compition peice, and two small fries to go, both comedies. I apologize to SEANCHAIBEAR for not being able to do his harvest festival play but I am streched as it is. 

Today in Science a kid showed me some poems he wrote and one of them was about a crow, it was very good. I really like drawing but I can hardly ever think of anything good, but his poem gave me the inspiration to draw this crow standing on a tree branch at night with the forest fading into darkness behind him, I think it's one of the best drawings I've ever done. So if anyone would like to please send me some poems or short stories or anything and maybe you'll inspire me? I'll see if I can email a copy if a can scan it to whom ever sends me stuff.

Life over all is ok, there are already people at school who wish me dead, but there are some who wish me living and occasionly near them so it's not to bad. And big big big news, I got a mandolin and am learning to play. It's incredible. Unlike guitar or bass you can play it anywhere and don't need any space and it sounds great.

Eventually I figured out that it happens mostly after I'm lieing down with me leg striaght so I've been trying to sleep with my knee bent but it's not to comfy. Before that at Zachs house I fell of his stairs and hurt my big toe real bad, then I fell of his stairs again and hurt it more, one always comes back in worse shape when going to zachs house, but I've been taping the toe to the one beside it so it doesn't hurt so bad. Last night as I was walking around my left knee suddenlybegan to hurt, it seems to do so only when I walk.
     I'll be getting surgery soon for my perferated ear drum so I can finally go swimming! Well, I'm not really that excited but it would be nice to go into the pool when everyoine else is, not that I'm ever invited places with a pool. Well thats the recent stuff, oh wait GERMAN CLASS ROCKS!!!"

"event","School; Crap, Yay, Damn, Whoo, Suck suck suck. Well that sums it upp but detials are fun. School has started and I am a lonely little freshman. It's not to bad so far, I'm even having the occasional conversation with an upper classman. My old friends are there to and though they aren't in most of my classes they do find themselves in some. Like Zach is in my wellness class which would awful if not for him. Unfortunately I can't take sewing which I was realy looking forward to but I think I'll take mythology instead. I haVE MET A FEW NEW PEOPLE ONE OF THEM INCLEDING THIS GIRL, WHOSE NAME i DON'T REALY WANT TO SAY INCASE i'M WRONG AND SHE STUMBles upon this, but I have a feeling she's interested in me. I have no feelings for her besides a potential friend but when ever a girl seems to like me it messes with my head. I'm not technically dating HannaH but I feel a very strong connection with her and it would basicly be cheating if I did something with someone else, I don't want to do anything but I'm just mentioning it. On top of that I told Zach that I would help him get a girlfriend so I feel really bad because from what I can tell he's got no one interested in him, I'm hoping to get this girl to like Zach. My brother played my baNDS MUSIC IN HIS MUSIC IN THE TWENTIETH CENTuary class so we are becoming more known, though we kinda need to practice. 


     Last night I found myself in a pretty awful mood, not really angry or sad or anything just all negative feeling combined itno one bad mood, then I realized that I'll probably be in a mood like this for the next 4 years, I've yet to break the mood of negativity."

"event","First entry, eh? Well I'm happy to have a live journal, thanks to Matt and whoever gave me the code. Today Has been uneventful so far but yesterday was quite a happening time.

I arrived in Gardiner at the mini-park to find HannaH, my very best friend it the whole world to whom I cherish and adore, crouching on the curb wrapped in a blanket. It was cold and windy and early so we decided to lay down and rest in the grass under the blanket, after a while two police officers showed up woke us and began asking questions, both of us a little dazed sense we had been lying there for some time. He asked us our names, where we are from, what we were doing, why we are in gardiner, then he asked for identification, Hannah was at a loss and all I had was my theatre resume, he then got our addresses and phone number telling us that he is going to call our parents to make sure everything is all right. He explained that we can't sleep on public property, we told him that we couldn't get a ride any later because our parents worked. He then asked us if we had partied the previous night and had alcohol and drugs and the like, we said no. He then told me I was ok but that HannaH looked and I quote ""a little Errrrrrrhish.."" He left us there wondering ""Don't they have ANYTHING better to do?""

    Later a man thanked us for being us outside of the grocery store. We also saw Jerry Marichno (forgive my spelling) who is a person we met at rehearsals one day for the play ""Steal Fire"" which by the way was incredible. Well he asked if he could photograph us, he used to do it a lot and is taking it up again, nice guy. And we visited Matt which was also a swell time. He's a cool guy and a good friend, HannaH is my best friend and I adore her things are going really well, besides that summer is nearly over and school will start soon. The good thing about summer is that I can easily avoid people who I don't like and who don't like me. At school they are everywhere, and that when my mood plummets into the abyss of negativity."

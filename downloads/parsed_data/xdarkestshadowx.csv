I wanna make a post on <a href=""http://www.frobba.com"">frobba.com</a>, but the server's down. It's been down for about an hour. I have some mods to add and make a post and I need to read an old post BUT I CAN'T!

Ah well. Here's a worthless post to get me through the next half hour."

"event","yeah, so, i was thinking today. i wanna change. no, not entirely and not like you fuckers think. i like me and my personality and all. but i'm too planned. everything i do needs to be blue-printed out. i can't just up and do something. like, i want to get in my car and drive on the interstate untill i get bored. and maybe come abck the same day. i want to do that. but will i? not without mapping it out on mapquest and buying a bunch of food first.

one of these days im going to be spontaneous.

I think I'll start tomorrow, around noon."

"event","There are two things I need to do right now:

Scream really fucking loud to break the tension
Smoke a cigarette as it's been like 12 hours and I'm jonsing, bad.

I can't even put into words the emotion I'm feeling.

I'm seriously going to kill someone if I don't get a smoke in the next 2 hours. I can't sit still. GOD does this suck my ass. Not to mention the cause of all this. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. All typed. No copy/paste.

This is getting fucking ridiculous. It's been like 3 days. But what's more is I can't do shit about it. That's why it's pissing me off. I can't fix it. I hate when I can't fix shit. It irritates me. I usualy go have s moke when this happens. But I live at home. And my parents would flip out if I went on the porch for a smoke. Which reminds me. I'm out of smokes. GAGAGAGAHAHAHA. Even if I could, I couldn't. Oh the fucking irony.

EDIT: Aside from the smoking, I'm over it. I've calmed down. Maybe I'll head to Nick's tonight and unwind.

EDIT 2: Everything has been taken care of. I suck at handling situations that aren't much of situations to begin with. Life is good."

"event","Think about all the times your life has sucked ass.
Think about every time your parents yelled at you
Every time you failed a test.
When you wrecked your car.
Lost your job.
Girlfriend broke up with you.
Grandparent died.
You got so drunk you pissed on a cop car.
The time you broke your arm.
The time you found out you were adopted.

Wanna know what will make all of that worse?

The fact that my life is so fucking perfect right now. Sucks to be you, and it's fantastic to be me."

"event","<i>The Rules:
1) On your current playlist, hit shuffle and pick the first fifteen songs on the list.
2) Write down the first line of the song.
3) Have your friends comment and see if they know the songs. (No cheating, cause that would be dumb.) And it might be a song done by several, so any one of those are alright.</i>

1)&nbsp; Your gentleman caller, well, he's been calling on another.
2)&nbsp; And he always wrote, and he always called, and he never lied cause he never said anything at all
3)&nbsp; Yeah, I am the super-eye, a blackened dream, a golden eye. Trapped in a fantasy. A silent clown, a villain see
4)&nbsp; First, there was this guy, we were dating, we broke up
5)&nbsp; Everybody is looking at me, I can't get out of bed, there is evil in my head
6)&nbsp; Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
7)&nbsp; Should I know what we're missing, what's to stop and they're missing
8)&nbsp; I gave into the stress in life, I can't escape, The pressure seems to get me down
9)&nbsp; So what's with your kind, you scavenge to find what makes you supreme in design
10)&nbsp; I waited for you all winterlong, you seemed to be where I belong,&nbsp; It's all illusion anyway
11) And know I wait my whole lifetime for you
12) You move like I want to, to see like your eyes do
13)&nbsp; Vital signs are slow and steady, so attentive and still not ready
14) I'm trying to find my home to you, I'm gonna wipe all your tears away
15) Childhood living is easy to do, The things you wanted, I bought them for you

It's a pretty varied list, so, see what you can do."

"event","i quit smoking.

how fucking retarded is that? i want something now. like...like...a fucking cigarette...fuck!


i hear after a week, things get easier... i hear the third day is the worst. tuesday (today, now) is day three. fuck my ass i'm craving... i hope i done FUCKING DIE from withdrawereerawerel.

right now, rj renyold's tobacco is looking at me, pointing, and wearing a trucker hat and hollister clothes and screaming ""YOU GOT PUNK'D!!""

Yes, RJ Renoylds Tobacco, I haven been dutifully punk'd.

Have you noticed how ""punk'd"" has the same number of characters as ""punked"" but MTV thought it'd be cooler to substitute the ""e"" with an apostrophe? I guess Macy*s has the asterik market cornered. What about the tilde? No one uses the tilde. Or the carret. Carrets are a more rare punctuation mark than a tilde, I think. What's weird is seeing all these different punctuation marks spelled out. Apostrophe? '. Tilde? ~. Carret? ^. Crazy how we get used to seeing the symbols and not the words. Like, when someone says ""exclamation point"" I don't picture the words. I picture a !.

This sucks. I guess since I gave up smoking, it's customary for me to take up some other habbit in its place. Chewing gum gets boring. Mints get expensive. Straws are tacky. Beer will fuck me up, and I don't think I could take a beer break at the office.

I want this post on Frobba.com, but after the Retif fiasco, my parents frequent my site, and I don't wanna hear shit about smoking that I already know. Unless they can come up to me and say ""Smoking makes your cock longer!"" I don't want to hear anything on the matter. Then again, hearing my mom say ""your cock"" is pretty bad, so I guess a smoking lecture wouldn't be horrible.

Wow... I think this is my longest LJ post since my website is better.

Maybe I'll start being addicted to chocolate. I could stand a few extra pounds. BTW, chocolate and peanut butter is the best marriage between two foods EVER."

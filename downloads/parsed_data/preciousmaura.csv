"event","<P><FONT size=2>so last i wrote i believe i was 16 - i say this jokingly because my birthday has passed. i was going to write in this at work but it slipped my mind- more than once. i dont really want to write about what i've been up to but i guess i should fill you in a little bit. 9 more days of hell and then the summer comes - the headliner in my car is bubbling down and it is bothering the shit out of me, i need to make a girls night soon, and i've shed some tears more frequently lately. no i'm not a baby- i just care too much. so anyway - i'll tell you about my day today. Its thursday and tho i did not realize it - a lot has happened today. this morning i woke up late and rushed around and i made enough time to grab a yogurt which is good because i perk up a little more with food. me steve and sara made our way to school and i had treacherous physical education first period. nobody in their right mind&nbsp;wants to play frisbee at 7:30 in the morning. but they make us anyway. in gym is when i usually have good chats and walk the track. anywhoo - so i went to chem with psycho loh and took a quiz that was a joke - yet she drops the bomb that we have a huge test on things i cant even pronounce - let alone memorize. school kills mee - so lunch was pretty gross considering i had to watch&nbsp;the half retarded freshman boy be provoked by the unbelievably&nbsp;sophmoric sophmore boys. (irony? i think not) anywhoo so this kid who i call beetlejuice because he reminds me of that guy ate about 9 packets of butter, creamcheese, ketchup and some other average condiments provided by jj's cafeteria. anyway so right at the end of the period this kid threw up and that was it- everybody ran- atleast he made some money off of it. the rest of the day wasnt too bad - tests and notes . the usual bullshit of school. after school i came home and ate and chatted with mommy - i havent been sleeping good because i've been pretty stressed out lately so i took a nap . chatted on the phone with ren for a while. went back to sleep then i had to force myself out of bed to go to work - ugh -- work sucked i spent an hour and a half reading and the rest working and pacing until i got to go home. so i drive home and i must say it was a very peaceful drive i listened to some blink and just mellowed out. so when i got home i had to throw on a wash, do some homework, take care of the dogs, clean my room, fold some laundry, get ready for bed, and fight with timmy and kev. SOMEWHERE in the midst of it all i got electricuted. and i felt high - although my hand has been spiratically spazzing i must say i feel a little strange *smiles* wow i got in a fight with t & k over towels. see i do all the laundry in my house (ash remember that surprise party when i was like ""oh come do laundry with me?"" hahahaa) yea so i hate doing all the towels that they use and waste - it just pisses me off .. they called me a towel nazi - i just lost it-- so i usually just update for ashley because she reads this and i love her for it. i need sleep now - love youuuu [ashley] mwah*</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=2>5 days until my birthday- happy birthday to hanna!!! and my gammy RIP -- so i'm having an off day today.. and livejournal of course is the place to vent - haha mainly because people can choose to read it or dismiss it&nbsp;- idc as long as i get it out of my head. school wasnt too bad today its just that my fridays suck when i know i just have work that night. after school i decided to go for a walk with scruffman and sara because its been a long time since we've done that. me and sara have a peculier relationship. we have these massive fights that widdle away to an unspoken apology and we go right back to the way we were. we chatted about her prom tonight and how exciting and of course i complained to her because shes the only one that will really tell me to shut up and get my shit together when i need to hear it. i was supposed to pick up my lovely boyfriend today at 3:30 as usual and he called me at 2:40 to tell me to get him at 3 which was physically impossible for me to get ready to get him and make it there - i dont want to get into it&nbsp;but i ended up not getting him and i havent talked to him since and i want to kill somebody right now. so when he hung up on me i brought the garbage cans in for mommy and got dressed to run errands. i got a birthday card from my grandma obrien which is awesomee!! so i went to the bank and cashed it and went to nissan and finally ordered my new sun visors!!! i love ittt .. so they will be in on ...mmm tuesday? after that i drove down 9 and got through every light and i started to perk up . i went to miss sara's house to see how beautiful she looked for her boyfriend's prom and i must say - she should have worn that dress to jay's junior prom because it was sooooo pretty - sara if you read this anymore i loveee youu* barcia showed up too to take some pictures of me . just kidding - but she came to see sara. we all took pictures and laughed and then i had to be off to work *sad face* -- on my way to work i got sad again. i was stuck in traffic by the little playground by fishkill elementary and i was watching the little kids play. i saw this little girl with long brown hair on the swings and she had that little ""i wouldnt want to be anywhere else right now"" smile on. i remember when i used to go on the swings and swing as high as i could and jump as far as i could get and usually landed in the dirt but i had that same smile on my face. i really do miss when i was a little kid with not a worry in the world. i moved up about 10 feet and i was still watching- the girls mother came over and told her it was time to leave and she started to cry. her mom told her the swings will be there tomorrow- but that girl has no idea that in a couple tomorrows they won't be there - she wont be there. she'll be sitting in her car watching another little girl play and she'll reminiss like this - i hope whoever reads this can relate - or maybe i'm just talking randomly. comment if you love me* mwah-</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=2>hey guys - it's been a while . if you don't already know i'm grounded for 2 weeks due to my retarded&nbsp;situation&nbsp;last saturday&nbsp;. january 22nd is my day of freedom!&nbsp;- it's not like i'm counting or anything [6 days left] -- i know now everything is going to be different. no trust with my parents. no sleepovers for a long ass while. as renato says i'll be ""needing permission slips and a chaperone for everywhere&nbsp;i go"" - haha it won't be that bad i swear. atleast i have school to see everybody, and work to go online. but i'm missing my love like crazyy&lt;3** --&nbsp;for the first time in a week i saw barcia and talked to her for more than 35 seconds. were both pretty much&nbsp;screwed . i didn't get to go to stratton this weekend so i'm pretty bummed about that. oh well it was no skiing or 1 more week. fuck that i need to get out of heree! - anywhoo all week nothing has happened that was special. [well maybe some things :)]&nbsp;i have&nbsp;3 projects due and i just keep putting them off, my windshield wiper&nbsp;broke and i&nbsp;can't get this stupid piece off to look at what happened, i&nbsp;haven't talked to my dad- i've given up on it because it's useless we've never gotten along. as long as me and my mom are talking then i'm good. if your wondering why my mood doesnt exactly&nbsp;match my tone of writing thats because the only thing i have to be excited for is saturday! [6 more days] well i would write about my renato but i'll keep it to myself *smiles* i love you** okay i'm going for a walk with sara - i'll write again soon tho&nbsp;. loveyou's--</FONT></P>

""we have our tight-knick group and i wouldn't want it any other way* &lt;3"" riight collz? lunchroom talks love ya* -- anywhoo so thursday me and barcia and mommy went to jersey to go shopping with my aunt . so me and barcia bonded with the fam and went to see meet the fockers - they're movie theatre was hugee . not to mention freakin' expensive . it was a good movie though! -- friday i came home and left with barcia to go to walmart to get food . i brought her home only to discover her mom went nuts and decided to ground her . she had to sit home on new years [barcia if you just ran away i would have came and got youu!] -- i went home and got all pretty-pretty and waited for my love&lt;3* had a niice loongg night together [sorry no details kiddies] . anywhoo newyears day we woke up with lots of laughter and major hangovers . i went home to drop my stuff off and we went to his house to sleep . well i went home eventually only to go back again sunday . we cleaned my car because it was rather gross&nbsp;- monday school started again and it was interminable . today wasn't so bad . my mom called me during 7th to let me know i accidentally ordered the grille&nbsp;. oops! i went to renato's and we went to the mall to return some clothes that we both needed to return . went to his house and i had to go to work -- i was seriously about to call in!! ahh well i need the money and i think he's stopping by soon - wow that took long . so i'll talk to you kids later . love you's*</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT size=2>It's amazing that George Carlin, gross and mouthy comedian, could write something so very eloquent. A wonderful Message by George Carlin:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness. We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life, not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things. We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less. These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete. Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. Remember to say ""I love you"" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you. Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there. Give time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind. AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away. &nbsp;&gt;George Carlin</FONT></P>

"event","it ended up more as always but still not too bad and everything i had at dinner was low fat.

bf: biscuits 330
    v8 70
lch: nothing
din: 1/2 caesar salad 187
     bowl low fat chicken noodle soup 98
     bread 108
dessert: fat free gelato 60

TOTAL: 852

I had planned to just get the salad but I calculated that it would be less calories if I got the half soup half salad thing with this really tasty low fat chicken noodle soup that I was pleased with.  I usually wouldn't eat the bread but the other day I discovered that I like it, so I ate it, unfortunately.  My friends wanted dessert and I always complain and stuff, so to appease them I said we should go get gelato.  I knew if I was there I'd get something, so I figured I might as well steer them towards the fewer calories.  And I was so happy that there were lots that were 100% fat free and only 60 cals.  If it had been more I wouldn't have gotten any.  But surprisingly it was some of the best stuff I had ever eaten and I didn't even have to feel too guilty about it.  So anyways thats why my total is 852- I'm blaming it on the bread that it went over 800.  But whats the point in blaming?  I still did it.  I'm gonna do some cruntches and push ups now and then go to bed.  So sleepy.

V8: 70
caesar salad: 374

i should have just not eaten anything this morning, but i knew that when i got home from school this afternoon i'd have ended up eating more which is way worse.  so this way i wont be hungry till we are meeting for dinner.  i swear why do i agree to go out so much... its just that i want to be out and play with my friends and usually people want to get food... stupid.  and i cant sit there and not eat something b/c 1 they'd all be suspicious since they already are anyways, and 2 i have no self control.  but i figure i'll only allow myself a caesar which is the skinniest salad they offer at panera, which is where we're going.  and i like it and won't have to eat it all, and prolly wont.

so anyways the total will be 774 and i'm not complaining.  ok well i complain no matter how many.. i'd rather it be like 100 a day but i cant do that.  too bad huh.  keeping it under 800 is a/b as good as i can do on a normal day with parents and friends, which is most days.  anyways thats all. *lara*"

"event","well i said i was 680 but i forgot something else i ate so its prolly more like 780 but still i'm ok with that cuz its under 800.  i got hungry but for once i had some control and didnt give in.  my friend bought this lemon poppy seed muffin that i had a few bites of and i did drink a/b a 1/3 of a snojoe at joe muggs, but that can't be too terribly much.  so i'm 'clocking in' at 800 for today and i actually feel it.  i haven't done good in so many days that i can actually feel the hunger pains.  usually they dont hurt.  i need to drink more h2o.  i also need to remember to take my weight smart pill/vitamin.  i think it helped for a while there while i was taking it.  so anyways i just got done doing crunches and push ups.  i wanted to run today but i didnt have enuf time.  tomorrow i am going to the zoo so we will be walking a lot, and i'm not gonna eat when i can help it.  i am so bad a/b saying things that will make ppl suspicious of my ed.  things that just come naturally out of my mouth like when i know on the spot exactly how many calories something is or when i get upset over have a certain amount of calories, or today when my friend was a/b to get something to eat at 11 at night and i was like dont do that dont eat.  and earlier to the same guy i said i was hungry and he was like eat and i was like i'm not going to eating is overrated.  like idk why i say those things and they might go unnoticed, but they just come out naturally.  i wish i could skinny and not have to obsess over so many things.  but its like my life.  i have to know how many calories everthing is and if anything is over 300 by itself i cant eat it.  and of course nothing over 800 if i do good.  when i eat at 1000 i feel and look fat.  but then of course i always look fat.  i dont even want to set a goal b/c i feel like i am really big right now.  the last time i weighed i was 108 but i am sure its more like 110 or 111 now.  which is so depressing.  so fat.  there is like this layer of fat everywhere i wish could just go away but idk if it even can no matter what i do.  my abs are really hard and strong but theres still that layer of fat.  well i did good today so i think i'll feel better tomorrow.  i am going to bed hungry and that is one of the best feelings.  anyways thats all *lara*"

"event","it would have been so easy for me to skip lunch today.  but did i? no.  ridiculous.  i am still obsessive over counting cals but i am geting more lenient with myself.  like sure lara you can have some more, etc etc.  i am so stupid sometimes.  i tell you i am gonna do better tomorrow.  my mom and i had this mini fight today over my eating.  she still tells me i dont eat enuf and i'm anorexic yada yada even tho its obvious i've been eating way more than normal lately.  she told me i had to eat before i left and i refused and i actually won.  i didnt have time to eat and i didnt want to.  i told her i'd get something at school 'like i always do.'  so i didnt eat anything till 330.  so i was doing good right?  then i get home and i knew she'd ask what i ate etc so something compelled me to make something, easy mac 250 cals.  i dont know why i dont know why.  it would have been so easy to just not eat.  i could have just lied.  then to make it worse we went out to dinner tonight and i got the healthiest thing i could find which was grilled shrimp and i only ate 3 out of the 12 they give you.  but i did eat the entire baked potato also... with butter.  smart huh?  ugh i wish i could just say no.  then i was hungry so i just had a packy of goldfish 170 cals.  so i am prolly like over 1000 cals RIDICULOUS i am sick of being fat.

on a happier note 2 people said i looked different and that it was cuz i lost some weight.  i am kinda sick of hearing it.  i wish i hadnt' been so fat before that its this noticeable.  but on the other hand i'm glad i look better, if not where i want to be, but i kinda wish ppl could just notice and not tell me a/b it.  makes me feel fat again.  

tomorrow all i'm going to have is a fat free yoplait 100 cals no matter how tempted i get.   my mom will make dinner but i will make a point to eat as little as possible.  i almost want to learn to purge but everyone discourages it.  i just hate eating.  i really do.  i wish food didnt taste good or that i had the control to spit it out."

"event","i feel like crying and idk why i must be hormonal.  i'm also still sick and just barely made it thru my show tonight w/o becoming hoarse.  the pathetic thing ab it is that the director told me to project more and i swear if i talked any louder either my voice would crack or nothing would come out.  so idk i just hope its even better tomorrow. 

as for eating i feel depressed and i haven't felt really depressed a/b my fat in a few days.  i had to have chickfila today with my friend who is moving to college in 2 days and i got a kids meal with 6 nuggets and sadly, i ate them all.

6 nuggets: 217.5
small fry: 290
diet coke: 0
arby's sandwich: 388

TOTAL: 895.5

absolutely disgusting.  and i feel it but i can hardly care cuz i feel so sick and tired and i could only manage 20 crunchs and 10 push ups... pathetic.  im gonna try to do more.  it makes me feel better anyways even if its not doing anything.

on a side note, several people told me i was tiny today.  too bad its not true.  my mom says i am too skinny and i dont need to lose anymore weight.  i think she's worried a/b me but not sure enuf to actually confront me a/b having an ed.  and i'm glad.  i dont want anyone to try and 'help' me.  im just fine the way i am and i want to be thin.  i havent even reached my main goal of 100 but its coming.  9-10 more pounds to go and that shouldnt be too hard.  something thats a little frustrating is that none of my pants fit b/c they are too big... i think i wrote that yesterday.  its definitely a good thing but i cant afford to go out and buy new stuff.  but most of what i have makes me look like a clown its so big.  stuff that used to be tight... sadly enuf.

anyways thats all i've got to say.. ive got to get some sleep.

"event","well yesterday the scale said 109 and that is so effing HAPPY.  i have been doing really really well- almost fasting, but eating just a little to keep my stomach from growling.. but its gotten to where my body just rejects food, or my stomach has shrunk considerably enuf that it doesnt need as much food.  a happy thought is that i've lost 13 pounds in less than a month.  but what isnt happy is that i still see fat in the mirror... will i ever see what i want to see?  i do see a difference, a good difference, but really will it ever look good?  idk... its weird not being able to fit in my pants b/c they are too big... usually its the other way around.  it makes me feel good but also gross that i used to be that big.  tomorrow my friend asked me to go to chikfila with her so i'm planning already to get a kids meal with a diet lemonade or diet coke thats a/b 300 cals right there but then i wont have to eat anything else all day b/c tomorrow night i have a show and i dont have to eat dinner at home during show days.

in other news, saturday and sunday brett kissed me backstage and i haven't known what to think for the past few days... i've been mostly wondering what he was thinking.  so tonight at our pick up rehearsal we went to swing on the swings togther afterwards and we talked a long time and he kissed me and we just kinda realized that there is some kind of connection between us.  i dont think either of us really know what it is or where it will go or what, but he wants to find out.  i dont want to lose control of my feelings by giving them to him so i am being very cautious.  i think he senses that or knows it.  idk... idk how i feel its weird.  but i just know that i feel comfortable with him and good when he holds me... and i esp like it cuz it makes me feel small and skinny.

anyways thats all i've got to say... this is pretty long and i dont think anyone really reads it anyways.  nini *lara*"

"event","well i'm back mostly b/c i just feel like i need to talk.  theres no one i can talk to a/b my anorexia.  i've never been diagnosed or hospitalized but i am pretty much full fledged ana.  and i like it that way but i wish sometimes that i could tell someone.  but i just cant.  sometimes it almost comes out... like i want to have someone i can share my excitement with when i reach a goal.  but if i say anything ppl will just be like you arent eating enuf.  they wont be happy for me... they'll think i have a problem.  its not a problem.  i know that i have to have some food to live and i'm ok with that.  but keeping the food intake at a super low level so i can continue to lose weight isn't a problem.   its not a problem that i want to be skinny.  its not a problem that i want to see bones.  its just i wish someone could understand.  i like being a part of my ana lj community but its still hard b/c they are people you can't see and talk to all the time for support.  i just wish i had someone around who would be happy for me when i say i've made it to 110, 105, 100.  b/c it makes me so happy but no one to share it with.  its weird like i dont really have to have as much support to achieve it, its more like i want someone to share the victories with.  idk... i guess thats all.  bye.

"event","not going too well today... its cuz i'm not doing anything.  for the past week + i've been on the go so much with my show that i haven't had to eat, or not much at least even when the cast goes out to dinner.  i can get away with not eating cuz no one cares or notices.  some of my friends notice but then they forget.  but since today and tomorrow and most of wed we are off, i am stuck at home with my mom watching and bringing me food.  so i'm prolly at a/b 1000 cals almost for today so i'm not even going to count them up.  tomorrow i will do much better.  i have a cold or something so i have an excuse.  yesterday the scale said 110 and i do not want it to go up.  on friday i want it to say 105- thats prolly pushing it but if i eat very very little i might make it.  so thats all thats going on.

I only see it when I haven't eaten and i can feel my bones and look slim in my clothes.  and then i eat and i feel almost miserable.  not completely miserable bc i know i am restricting and limiting myself a loooooot more than i used to.  i can remember not caring what i ate or not reading labels, but now i can't eat a thing w/o seeing how many calories it is.  and i like it that way yanno i dont feel like i'm missing out.  i know i'd rather be thin and beautiful than eat anything!  i want to be skin and bones and i swear i've got to lose 10 pounds and hopefully then i will be skin and bones.  i know i can do it i just have to be harder on myself.  it will be worth it.  i think once i'm 100 i'll be content, altho getting to the double digits would be nice and some accomplishment.  but we'll see when we get there.  maybe i'm setting my goals too soon and hoping for too much.  i dont know.  all i know is i want to be thin and im going to no matter what. ok gg to sleep.

i'm also taking these one a day weight smart pills... they aren't supposed to make you lose weight, but its supposed to help you control it, with diet and exercise.  i just have a fear of diet pills altho they are so tempting.  luckily today no one bothered me a/b my eating when i didn't eat much.  i just picked at it and swished it around.  i talked with one friend who is attempting a diet (she never gets any farther than a few hours with it...) about eating and i was pretty convincing with explaining how i am 'horrible at dieting' which is absolute bullshit b/c when i put my mind to it i can lose weight fast.  i just want her to shut up a/b my eating!!!  110 is for thursday I HOPE HOPE HOPE its there otherwise i will be depressed.  anyways thats it.

"event","well i didn't weigh today b/c i'm positive i didn't reach my goal.  it shouldn't have to be so hard to get to 110.  but i actually binged yesterday and ate too much the day before.  like <em>really</em> binged yesterday... and i usually don't.  i succumbed to the <em>taste</em> of food and that is so pathetic.  i could not stop.  i wont even go into what all i had.  but today was much much better.  luckily and not luckily i'm feeling sick, which makes me not want to eat.  i did bad and had 2 pieces of pizza from cici's which was a mistake in more ways than one.  not only did it make me feel fat and stupid for doing it when i know very well that goal 110 was today and i obviously didn't make it, it also upset my stomach as most grease-infested foods do and i couldn't get off the fucking toilet for a/b 2 hours.  so it makes me feel better that i shit all the damn food out (sorry so gross) but not good at my lack of self control.  i had the worst sinus headache all day so i took some meds for it which made me feel tired and everything seemed really funny.  the unlucky part is i had no desire at all to go run/walk which i usually want to do after i eat anything.  i just laid in bed.  i had rehearsal tonight.  our show is in one week and i wanted to be 100 lbs by opening night... not gonna happen unless by a miracle.  but i felt so bad and tired at rehearsal but at least i know that with all the work there, i burned at least <em>some</em> calories.  so thats whats going on... i'm gonna try and look up how many cals i had today- i dont think its too bad.

our regular internet service is still out so i can only get on at night.  i dont really care too much a/b having the net all the time but it would be nice to be able to get on for some support during the days.  but until next monday *hopes* we still won't have the internet in the day time.  at night we get on dialup.

"event","first a message to anyone i dont even know who wants to 'help' me by giving me advice, just leave and go elsewhere b/c i don't want to be told that i am making myself miserable when that is bullshit.  you don't know me and you don't know my life therefore you dont know how i feel.  i am perfectly capable of taking care of myself.  thank you

i cannot seem to control myself the past few days.  i am so good when i am focused.  but then people bring donuts into the house or they make cake.  usually i can have some self dicsipline but my period must be coming or something b/c i've felt so damn hungry.  i've got to stop thinking a/b how things taste and think instead a/b how great it feeeels to be thin.  and i am such a fucking porker.  i need to make a plan of exactly what i'm going to eat for the next few days so i can just do that and not be tempted to eat anything extra or anything else.  its my only hope for reaching 110 by wednesday.  maybe lower if i'm lucky.  anyways gg for now

"event","i just weighed on the scale i usually weigh on and it said 115.4!!!!!  subtract the .4 and that is my tuesday goal!!!  earlier today i weighed on a different scale that said 117, but the one i usually weigh on is newer and more accurate so that is a relief.  still a long ways to go but HELL i have reached goal number one.

ok i'm done

"event","well i thought i was a little over 500.  i forgot a/b the damn donut i had to have.  if they are in the house i am gonna want one i swear i have no self control.  but i worked out like an hour so i think i at least worked that off.

fried chicken thigh (a killer): 230 cal
2.5 oz pork tenderloin: 116 cal
5 oz mashed potatoes: 151 cal
broccoli: 78
0.5 tbsp margarine: 49

"event","the minute i get up this morning my mom comes in with groceries, not only groceries but fried chicken from publix.  and when i just sit in the den like i'm not going to eat any she starts asking me ""are you not gonna eat?""  and it would definitely look weird if i didnt since she knows i love the chicken.  sooo i ate one thigh, felt extremely guilty, but luckily (and unluckily) it upset my stomach and again i was on the pot.  so idk if that got flushed right out of my system or what but thats 230 cals.  GEEEEZ.  and tonight she is making pork tenderloin which isnt too unhealthy b/c she makes it with marinara sauce- which i need to look up.  

fried chicken thigh 230 c
~3oz +/- ~200 c
~1 cup mashed potatoes (can't see myself eating a whole cup) 223 c
0.5oz cheese (that she's bound to put on the potatoes) 55 c

which is 708 calories!!!  yes, under my limit.  but damn.  i just dont want to lose my skinny streak.  i mean i still look in the mirrow and see fat but i do feel a little better in my body.  i can actually see and feel the change and i like it.  so after these 708 i am stopping for the day definitely.  i want to run or something but my stomach is still fucked up which makes my body feel so tired.  

mom also brought donuts home- I SWEAR this house is like one big temptation island or something.  if i had my own apt this would be so easy and i would be 100 lbs in maybe 2 weeks.  as it is, i haven't weighed since friday and my goal of 115 is tomorrow.  i hope i get it.

"event","ive calculated that today i consumed approximately 577.5 calories and worked off 200 of them.  thats not enuf working out.  i am mostly pathetic.  i wish my mind didn't make me like paranoid... or idk what the word for it is.  its like i think about food so much that i end up eating something i dont even want to eat.  tonight i ate a piece of cake but it really grossed me out just to eat it that i ended up only eating half of it, then this is really gross but i could not get off the toilet for at least an hour.  it really messed with my stomach.  i told myself thats what i get for eating it, stupid.  so anyways heres the breakdown for today:

12 cherries: 70 c
~3.5oz grilled salmon: 161 c
~1/2 meduim potato: 58.5 c
1 tbsp butter: 98 c (ridiculous, i know)
1/2 slice cake with icing: 160 c (AHHHHHHHH)

which equals: 577.5 calories for the day

which is under my limit of 900, but omg could i be more of a pig?  why does that seem like sooo much food?  b/c it is!?!?  and i worked out 200 calories so idk if it counts to subtract that for my day which would make it 377.5 for today.  idk... that doesn't seem like it would count but idk.  it feels so good to be light and hungry.  but it doesn't feel good to look down and see all my flab everywhere, and my ass jiggling when i run- sickening.  i wanted to work out some more tonight but my stomach is so upset that i dont want to make it worse.  so until tomorrow...

"event","well so far so good.  

breakfast/lunch:
12 bing cherries  ~70cals

i worked out for 30 minutes on treadmill/weights ~200 cals byebye

i have to sing at church and running around putting up the damn numbers on the board always works up a sweat (cuz i'm so damn out of shape) so that'll be something but not much.  then they are making me go out to eat which i dont want to, but at least there i can plan ahead what i get.  i swear calorieking.com is wonderful.  i'm planning on getting the 7 oz grilled salmon which is +/- 321 cals and i most likely won't eat it all, but if for some crazy reason i do i still won't be going over my cal limit for the day.  i'm doing 900cals a day right now and i'm gonna work down.  its sad how tempting food is, but i am doing so great right now and watching the numbers on the scale go down is just more and more inspiration.  i am going to reach my goals!  and i'm already happier.

"event","well this is my first post just cuz i only wanted this journal to join a community.  today was a decent day... not really with the eating but still.

i had to take the cat to the vet and then my mom and i went to tmobile and got NEW PHONES!!  which is so awesome cuz the fones we had sucked really bad.  but then she wanted to go eat and its just so frustrating cuz i know when i get there im gonna eat.  i always order water and lotes of it with lemon so maybe i'll fill myself up a little before the food comes.  luckily the lunch portions were small anyways.  but i wanted to go cuz my friend works as a hostess there so i thought it would be nice to go see her.  so it was ok and i didn't feel too upset with myself afterwards.  a happy thing is i reached one of my goal weights yesterday of 120, which is still a lot of fat i know.  i want to be 115 at least by some time next week.  i know i can do it- i feel motivated.  i'm gonna try to right in here what i eat so i can keep track of how many calories i am consuming.  i need to work out more but i have no time.  i know, excuses.. ah well.  thats all.

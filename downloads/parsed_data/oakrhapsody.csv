Thanks Sis ^_~.  And to Acorn, for showing me the wonderful picture of her pride and joy.  You and Isaac will be together Sister, I have Seen it."

You are a visionary with<br>unmatched intuition and spiritual<br>consciousness.  The mystical world and<br>unexplainable forces fascinate you. There<br>resides in you a true dignity and nobility, and<br>others see you as a worthy leader, and loyal<br>friend. You are often very mature, with a deep<br>understanding of human nature, and you will<br>instinctively encourage and guide others toward<br>their full potential.

You find it natural to express yourself<br>aesthetically and artistically, you may be<br>involved in the artistic professions, a<br>religious organization, or in activities that<br>have a degree of ceremony and ritual. You would<br>make a good therapist, healer, psychic, or<br>entrepreneur.

"event","Just a post here.  My day was great, went to look at some the new apartment and finish up the nursery for the baby.  Also found a silver circlet with a tigers eyes to rest over the Third Eye, very nice, with an oak leaf design for the circlet.  Very nice!  Also finally got a good statuette of Nike, greek goddess of Victory.  Finally!  Lemme see what else?  Found a long lost friend today, and also finalized plans for a trip to Jamica!  Wonderful!

"event","Yes I have returned.  Sorry for the long delay.  i'll try to post more regular now.  I was having some issues, but they are solved now, thanks to both my mundane and magickal families, that I love equally.  A certain Raven has posted that her time with the Witchschool and also the Correllian Trad is up, but we shalt see about that.  I am back in full force, and I have yet to have my say in the matter.  Not to say that my word is law, but it comes pretty close when it involves my Sisters.  Speaking of Family, the Coven of the Souls Family is now complete.  It includes:  Me, Raven, Kati, Kestra, Krestole, Mystics, Natalie, Gardenia, Acorn, Celtic, Stormy, Laneth and Tan.  A full cyber-coven of Thirteen.  We are all different, but I love them all the same anyway.  And we are very attuned to each other, so that is even better.  And there are alot of empaths in there also.  So that is my family, along with Tamuril, who is new, and I have yet to get to know her, but she seems nice.

"event","I'm an inborn empath.  I never really had any trouble with it until I began actually practicing Wicca.  Since joining the Correllian Tradition, my empathy has really started to show.  Lady Wendy, head of the Correllian Herbal Order and a High Priestess of the Correllian Tradition in Australia, believes me to be a highly developed empath, and so do some others.  She has given me an exercise to help with my psychic shielding, and also told me about the shield of mirrors, with mirrors facing inward and outward protecting me from others emotions.  Today I felt exceptionally drained and my 'Sisters' were worried about me.  One was so worried she almost told the girl we believe to be draining me [not intentionally] to leave.  It was a big mess, but it is all settled now, and though feathers were ruffled, and claws extended no one was really hurt, thank the Goddess."

"event","This week has been great so far.  My respitory infection that has been effecting me for so long is finally tapering off, and my doctors say if things keep moving the way they are, I may actually see the end of my asthma before the beginning of next year.  Also, one of my students through witchschool.com passed her Final today and is now an ordained First Degree Priestess of the Correllian Tradition.  Nothing makes me happier than seeing my students complete what they started, and I get even happier when I speak to them when they are further along the Path, and telling me of experiences and such."

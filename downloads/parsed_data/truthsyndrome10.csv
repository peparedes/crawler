"event","If you were to ask me what I've been doing for the past few years, I couldn't tell you... It's been a year of groundhog days and the only way to differenciate the days has been staring at the kitchen calender when making yet another simple meal for one at some ungodly hour. I know that nearly every day for the past few years has presented the same morning wake-up call - a feeling like a leadweight holding my body down, making it hard to move one foot from the bed and start with the day ahead which I know will hold no pleasantries of any material, form or substance. I feel anything I do is a diversion to stop the melancholic thinking. People will tell me to see friends, go shopping, get a job - but I feel un-capable of doing all such things. My mind is elsewhere, even the most simple tasks such as working as a Londis check-out girl proved difficult. My focus was elsewhere, all thoughts on concentrated on negativity and morbid thoughts and there was nothing I could do to stop thinking of these things - no matter how much fun I was meant to be having or how much work I was meant to be doing. I feel self-indulgent talking like this - everybody being in the same job and the same 'born + work = die' cycle but at least the majority there find worth/reward at the end of a task. I simply see no worth in anything. At the risk of sounding like a bored, middle class depressive - I have tried everything and nothing, NOTHING at all gives me any kind of hope for the future. 

I need to turn off my mind. 
I'm sick of labouring in this vicious circle where my body is exhausted and my mind over-active but not in a productive sense. I am un-inspired beyond all colours, frustrated beyond bile and bored out of my fucking mind. The worst thing is not being able to sleep, it's a different kind of insomania when the clock is ticking, you know your time is running out and you're plagued with thoughts of a hapless future. 

Somebody give me a dose of sanguine to go with this melancholy... please?"

"event","The concept of writing my life out for the judgment of others seems like an alien concept to me all of a sudden.. so I feel that my final 'hell j' entry should set the zeitgeist for how I'm currently feeling at the moment. Modern Sara - (or post-modern Sara - as funnily I thought that in order to be modern you must actually be post-modern - hah!)needs to look to the future, to the real friends who take her flaws and all, to the job she has in the summer, to the university years starting in September and to the rest of her life. Recently I was diagnosed with BorderLine Personality disorder (let the un-educated have their laugh...) but it's put a lot of things into perspective. My focuses have changed and I've realized to some extent you can look to other people for your happiness but at the end of the day - you're the one who has to make the most effort - there has to be happiness within, peace with yourself, harmony and all that jazz. Admittedly it being hard with chemical imbalance but happiness is a choice for a lot of people (bar excruciating circumstances) and I envy the blank vessels with choice. You start an existentialist, get thrown back by fate and end up a sour nihilist... well that was the case for moi anyway. But I'm determined to start believing again...cognitive therapy anyone? =P 

               This entry will not stop short self justification to a few and and I could sound condescending by saying I have hold copious amounts of pity for aforementioned people but it's better to take a skitzoid, Asperger like stance when talking about people who feel they always need a nemesis. Don't judge them too harshly - it's what get's people through the day, it gives them a chance to feel something inside, it's what makes a bloody good movie - good VS evil - but I refuse to play anybody's enemy. The manipulator of the chameleon club has always been of some fascination to me. If you're 'down' with this nasty little character then all is well - you're the Mussolini to her Hitler but if you so much as have one flaw then Einsatsgruppen to you with a very public (well cyber public) knock-down reminiscent of standing in the school play-ground whilst Mistress manipulator ring-a-rosies around you with her heard of gullible advocates. The biggest amusement for your's truely is that anybody I've ever introduced to this acidic little girl  - she's done her best to ruin any sort of decent relationship I once had with these people. At first I questioned myself as a person, as there was - Hannah, Chris, Laura - was I really to blame for our friendships going to the pitts? Odd that before she corresponded and dug her talons into these people, all was fine. Just as all is fine with all my other friends that she never got a chance to manipulate via msn or some other sneaky two way style. I have no problems with anybody else, I've had friends for years who haven't met Mistress Manipulator and all is well with them... coincidence? Nein, I think not... 
This child likes to think of herself as some sort of supreme truth-teller on behalf of the people but as blame worthy as it seems - she really does bring out the bad side of people and even admits to 'head fucking' being quite a hobby for her. She won't go far in life and lordy she sure isn't at the moment and I suppose that should give me some pleasure, but to be honest - it really and truly doesn't. I sincerely hope she stop's poisoning the minds of others and make them behave in her manner only for her to whip out the halo at the last minute and pass the blame to expose the devil she made under her fine tutelage. Even better - Miss Compulsive Liar should seek help before it's too late. 
             It end's here - I move on - so I wish her all the luck in the world..no matter how many 'ARP's' are thrown my way. =D Good luck in life little girl, and I hope you stop putting on your school uniform one day soon.

"event","Five years ago, director Christopher Spencer made a film for Channel 4 about people who have sexual relationships with animals. Featuring extraordinary case studies, Animal Passions revealed that these people are forced to the very margins of a society that can neither understand nor condone their actions. After the film was shown a number of zoophiles, as they like to be known, wanted to tell their stories and open the lid on a strange and often shocking sexual subculture where these passions are not limited to lone individuals, but include women, couples and even animal relationships within families. So Christopher returned to tell their stories and talk to experts about the deep forces and early frustrations that push these people to break such a strong cultural taboo. Mark lives with his 'wife' Pixel, a pony. He has paid a high price for his chosen relationship, shunned by society, friends and family. Michael and Laurie's marriage foundered when he continued to have sex with horses, although Laurie had lost her virginity to a dog and enjoyed a relationship with their golden retriever, Baby Golden. Ken and Ellie's first date culminated with her having sex with her horse. And Sarah gave up her comfortable middle-class married life to live with her dog."

"event","To myself I am expressing penitent feelings today but in a sense... I am thankful! I feel as if there are two halves of me as a person inside. One who is releasing these feelings and the other deeper inside who listens to the muddled discourse. I'm thankful in a sense that I can can acknoweledge these feelings as being melancholic and can repeat them to 'my other half' without slipping under psychosis. But I'm not so greatful because some people need never to reflect on these feelings or dwell such as I. My Mother called me an 'inward character' the other day... anyone agree? Life is a paradox of complications and only few are willing to acknowledge this, but sometimes I wonder if the over-analytical, observant people are the stupid people? They are the one's who feel like trash afterall. How I wish to live a life in the oblivious style of Kinga from Big Brother. Sure, she's ineloquent, tubby and could even push a Saint to murder BUT she's happy and is leading a full, fruitful life in my view of the 'half empty/half full' debate. I'm not making any sense.... (again) But even good fruits rot in time and everyone has their regrets.


Thoughts running through my head today: 

1. Drama the poor relation to poetry? 
2. My over-active mind and my shiftless body. 
3. To leave the house or not to leave the house?
4. Why?


After having to look into many Jacobian Renaissance drama's for revision - I think I can safely claim that all renaissance drama's follow the convention of revenge once being a tool of justice becoming the tragedy. And tragedy is the outcome of injustice and therefore turns for redress to revenge. You could sum up most of the Jacobian back catalogue like that.  

Am currently in a state trying to perfect my hosanna to Llewelyn - 'Menai Straits' (working title). Cilmeri rip-off ahoy? I'd say the poem was more defeatist in style of Seamus Heaney than like Geraint Lloyd Owens. Am trying to track down some works of the Gododdin tribe in the native language though as I believe as a Cymro this is the way to read it and appreciate its full concernment.

"event","Well nobody can accuse me of not making the effort! I stepped out impartial and stepped back in full of contempt. They had all already preconceived what I was due to one persons representation and with no elucidation came the ardent, scathing, BITCHY comments. Was I really going to waste my night out around these people? They'd already pre-judged me based on one persons POV and were all ready at the draw with their amusing, empty threats to apparently 'fuck me up' or the like. 
It wasn't totally capricious of me I suppose when I walked out, I was not going to stand there and be spoken about like that when I've really done fuck all and these girls had not even spoken to me once in their lives. No doubt I will get the tag-label of a brain washing Charlie Manson type because Maria decided to follow me out, but she was just doing what a decent friend would do because if anyone was treating any of my friends/acquaintances in that manner - I'd do exactly the same. I'm not going to get vexed about it but I must say my jaw dropped to Lurch like levels when I received a text condemning our departure with all the blame being put on yours truly. EXPECTING me to hang around with all that hostility that HE, HIMSELF created? No way Josey! 

Lastly I must make apologies to fair Lawzy and valiant Maria as our late night escapade's were put on hold due to my passing out in front of the small screen.  I will prostrate at both thy' feet if thy' will forgive me? Would flexing be out of the question tonight, girls?

"event","I just sit in my lessons listening to the blithe 'discussions' that my psuedo intell classmates have in a Glasnost manner as they discuss such issues as The Columbine Massacre and The Iraqi War with such confidence when all they rely on is RE-PRESENTATION. And don't we all? 


I just don't even bother to be part of it, am like the malcontent figure who sits scoffing everytime somebody mentions the words 'Saturday night' whilst reaching for their slick new Orange Pay as you Go models to text greasy haired mates to finalise their duplicate to last week's mad 'weekender bender' plans. I wish the only thing I had to worry about was where to go on a Saturday night. I'm not claiming to be some tortured mind with my soul in purgatory but I do admit to being over analytical and shamefully over sensitive to the point where I can really feel my heart shrinking whenever somebody gives me a side-ways glance or ignores my phone-calls. Small things that an alpha human or even a feeble imbecilic like could shrug off without a second thought.

I also must stop counting the amount of times people say 'I' or 'Im' or 'Am' in a sentence... 
The sunnier it is, the more flaws that are exposed in my opinion. I don't want to go outside, I don't want to pretend anymore. It's just like I've reached breaking point and I can't find a window high enough, I'm sick of every fucker around me and if this is all there is to this life then I wonder what's the point when life's troubles will be forever linear? Have the ultimate Marxist outlook on life, the whole ""born + work + die = empty."" Can one really change their head-set through learning or meditation or perhaps even rehab? At the moment I am content with few aspects of my life but know that in a matter of weeks things will be all change and my security that I've just warmed to will be replaced by uncertainty and another long adapting episode.
Colour me vexed - am sounding like a lank haired adolescent here, but to be honest we don't so much 'grow up' as go through different stages and some people stay in same mind-set, stuck in a rut longer than the general society obiding hoi polloi and perhaps my downfall is not actually being able to move on. 
Was watching MTV2 the other day and the video for Kylie and Nick Cave's - 'Where the wild roses grow' came to my visual view and I just burst out crying, unheralded out of the blue because it reminded me of a certain someone from my past. The past is a weird thing and I sound like the most pretencious vagina of them all when I quote  that the way forward is to embrace change (according to Gloria Steinam)but it's hard when the rose-tinted specs come out to play. I know I'm not going through anything different to any other human being and there is no such thing as pure happyness but only occasional bouts of it, but I wish to be content or indifferent like the majority and stop living this anxiety driven half homosapien/half medicated life I'm currently 'living'. *Goes off on totally different subject* I wonder what is actually poignant in time though?

Starring:

Bendster.
Laughnie
Brookie

(Names changed for legal reasons, all similarities to names and events are pure coincidence)

'Little misunderstandings were key on such a trip Brookie kept reassuring himself. Hands stroked hands and breaths crossed breaths, it was just like a love story waiting to be told. Brookie the smallest of the lads had always felt vulnerable around the big boys but with an air of completion he felt at home resting his head tentatively on Bendsters manly chest, listening to his humid breathing fill the warm night air.
Brookie staring up at Bendster in wonder, boxers tightening,something throbbing, pulsating as he bowed to his knees. Bendster gave a moan of appreciation as a smooth hand ran fingers through his crowning mane of hair....Laughnie had come to play this time. Bendsters gyrating hips swayed in the breeze as he stared up at the starry night sky, it wasn't what he had imagined at all. As he stifled a moan and bit his cherry lips, as strong pawing hands ran themselves over his monumental albastar like skin. These pawing hands anxiously yet carefully tore off his Asda's boxers in anticipation, letting out heaved gasps of awe at the result'

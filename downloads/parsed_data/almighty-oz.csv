"event","Hey Guys,
I know I haven't updated in a long time but I do actually have stuff to write about.  For starters congrats to the cast and krewe of Arsnic. I hear you guys are doing a great job and I'm really proud of all of you but on a sadder note I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it down to see it as I'm on double run crew and have tech all weekend, but I will be down for thanksgiving so don't worry, and I'll be working on jeckle and hyde  so.....  On a really good note I've made it this far with out being on probation so thats a really good thing , and on an even better note, my friend Clarissa the one from the accident is doing alot better shes walking around and stuff and even considering returing to school next semester yay! other than that after thanks giving I have like two weekes of school left, and then I'm home for christmas break, we're done the 17th.  Thats all I have time for now maybe ill write more later see you soon

I KNOW THAT MY ENTRIES HAVE BEEN FEW AND FAR BETWEEN BUT IM WORKING ON MY NINTH STRAIGHT DAY OFF CLASS INCLUDING SAT AND SUN SO...  BUT TO BEGIN I HAVE A KIND OF SAD NOTE MY FRIEND JACKY'S UNCLE PASTED AWAY YESTERDAY SO PLEASE PRAY FOR THE KEMP FAMILY.  
NOW RIGHT SO YESTERDAY WHICH STARTED OFF PRETTY GOOD, WE WERE IN THE THEATRE DOING RIGGING STUFF WHICH I THINK IS THE COOLEST THING EVER.  WE WERE USING A PIN RAIL FLY SYSTEM WHICH IS SORT OF LIKE THE FLY SYSTEM IN SCHOOL FOR THOSE OF YOU THEATRE FOLK, EXCEPT THAT ITS LIKE ""OLD SCHOOL"" SO SAND BAG WEIGHTS, AND SIX-TEN PEOPLE FOR ONE FLY BAR IT WAS SO AWSOME.  BUT THEN WE WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO THE SCENE SHOP,  IM ON CARPENTRY ROTATION, AND THAT SUCKED.  THE CARPENTERS ARE TWO WEEKS BEHIND ON BUILDING THE CURRENT SHOW, THREE SISTERS, THATS FIRST OF ALL, SECONDLY WE CUT WINDOWS OUT OF 2 SHEETS OF 3/4 INCH PLY WHICH IS THICK SO THE WINDOWS ARENT LEVEL... THUS THE FRESHMAN HAD TO SAND DOWN THE WINDOWS TO MAKE THEM LEVEL... ERGO 6 FRESHMAN INHALING SAWDUST FOR 6 HRS... NOT GOOD.  I AM SO SICK TODAY I FEEL LIKE I HAVD A LUMP OF SAWDUST IN MY LUNGS ISNT THAT LOVELY.  AND ASIDE FROM THAT WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER WINDOW TO BUILD OUT OF THE SAME CRAP... GRRRR. AND NOW HAVING SAID THAT, IM THINKING ABOUT CHANGING MY MAJOR, IM MEAN STILL BE A DT CAUSE I LOVE IT BUT IM NOT SURE IF I WANT TO BE A LIGHTING DESIGNER ANYMORE... IM REALLY TORN BETWEEN THAT AND TECHNICAL DIRECTION... FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DONT REALLY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE IT LIKE ELECTRICS V. CARPENTRY... I LOVE THEM BOTH.  I WANT TO DOUBLE MAJOR BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO DO BOTH BUT YOUR NOT ALLOWED TO BECAUSE LEAVE IT TO ME TO PICK THE TWO HARDEST MAJORS IN THE PROGRAM... SO THE BOARD OF STUDY WONT AND CANT LET ANY STUDENT DOUBLE MAJOR IN THOSE TO FEILDS AND THOSE R THE ONLY ONES THAT YOU CANT.  ALSO JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I REALLY AM CRAZY, OVER WINTER BREAK... WHICH FOR ME IS THE MONTH OF DECEMBER IM TAKING A 4 WEEK LIBERAL STUDIES COURSE... BUT THATS TECHNICALLY TO GET IT OUT OF THE WAY FOR JUNIOR/SENIOR YEAR.  
IN OTHER NEWS I MAY BE ON RUNNING CREW FOR THE UP COMMING SHOW WHICH MEANS I REALLY WONT BE HOME FOR LIKE THREE WEEKS AND YEA UNFORTUNATELY THAT MEANS IM NOT COMMING HOME FOR HALLOWSEEN WEEKEND... SRY GUYS
BUT NOW THAT IVE GONE ON FOR A WHILE I HAVE TO GO  I HAVE CLASS IN 20 MIN AND I WANT TO BE KIND OF EARLY SO I CAN GET COFFEE  SO ILL TALK TO YOU GUYS SOON... TELL PPLE I SAY HI... ESP GURLEY AND COULTER AND ILL SEE YOU SOON
LATER DAYS... YES MELISSA THE WEEKENDERS

"event","Hey guys,
So I had a pretty fun weekend, Friday after crew, was the opening night party for the first so The Moons a Baloon, its a show about ee Cummings potery, I didn't see it so I don't know, but the party was awsome.  I was out till like five in the morning, at around 1 two of my friends got sick so I took them home and went back, it wS so much fun.  The only part that wasnt good was that my parents were commung up at 1030 so I had to wake up early to pack so I got like 3 hrs of sleep and my eyes were really blood shot.  Umm so home was fun, I saw melissa Im glad you lke the shirt honey, and I hung out with my friend Cat sat night, That was fun we shot some pool, went to cappichino bar, nd then hung out on her stoop.  I get home at like 2.  Sunday was un eventful, It was mostly homework and sleep, and movies... resting up for the next couple of weeks I have class from 3-10.. production, and we have ad load in and strike this weekend sat and sun.  But so going home back to campus last night was fun, I was drinking coffee and i was way to hyper and ended up doing like 80 on the hutch, my mom was in the back like kate? how fast r u goin? I was like 65  don't worry, that was the most fun Ive had driving in a ling time.  Ummm lets see I think thats it, I hope every ones ok and when yoiu get a chance e mail me and we can have a more one on one convo... umm and if ne one knows sarah rebecca gaglio tell her i said hi and that she should email me... shes a fresh.  Pk ne way i have to go i have class in an hr so i just kinda want to chill b4 then Ill talk to you guys soon

"event","Hey Guys, 

For starters....GLBT & straight alliance thing, if u dont care scroll down.  This is a call for a nation-wide boycott in the traditions of Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King. They are asking all GLBT Americans & their Straight Allies to ""drop out"" of the United States economy for one day to demonstrate that we are vital & important members of our communities with significant economic presence. There are three elements to the boycott: No Work, No Purchases and No Cell Phones.
On February 24, 2004, the President of the United States declared war on gay/bisexual/transgendered Americans when he decided to support a Constitutional Amendment banning Same-Sex Marriage denying gay & lesbians over 1000 rights & responsibilities that all other Americans currently enjoy.
In addition, the Congress & State Legislatures have refused numerous attempts to pass employment non-discrimination laws. The discriminatory Don't Ask Don't Tell policy continues to make a mockery of the service of lesbian & gay service people, when other democracies (i.e. Great Britain) allow gays to serve in the military.
GLBT citizens pay taxes everyday to support our government & society, just like heterosexual citizens. As such, they will no longer be treated as second-class citizens without the full protection of the law in employment non-discrimination or legal status in marriage, adoption or other rights. They should be able to serve our country with distinction without fear of discharge.
Gay people do not choose to be gay -- who would logically choose to be despised by the majority. They do not choose to be homosexual any more than straights decide to be heterosexual. Left-handed people do not choose to be different than the right-handed majority -- they just are.
So in conclusion its like a silent protest. Like Rosa Parks did when they boycotted the buses. All you have to do it not use your cell phone, buy anything, & go to work. Just hang out. Its that easy. You dont have to be a gay male or a lesbian female to do this. If you believe that gays & lesbians should have the same rights as straight people then you should participate on October 8th.

Ok so in other news, umm lets see its cold up here, or at least its colder here than in brooklyn, and on tues.. it was like 45degrees out and my design fundamentals professor made us sit out side, it the middle of campus and sketck , and as kool as that is... its not fun in the cold.  Lets see, last night we cooked dinner in the common use kitchen, which is in the basement of my dorm, it was awome having something like a home cooked meal.  Oh and BTW, if any of you are interested in applying to purchase, I'd be happy to show you around one weekend if you let me know in advance.  Hmmm.... I miss you guys, and I miss having rehersal, I know that sounds like it couldnt happen but its true.  Anyway im goin back to sleep for a while so Ill talk to you soon
Kate


OH AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY MELISSA!!!!!.... im so sry I can't be there to day but I'll be home maybe this weekend, or at least in 2 weeks, so I'll see you soon Honey."

So...today is my day off...I'm bored, last night a bunch of girls on the floor, includung my hot RA Cassidy ;P decorated the hall bathroom... which dosent really matter to me to much b/c my suiet has its own bathroom, but it was still fun we had milk and cookies... and decorated.  We stuck lots of pictures on the wall and my rubber duckie.  umm what else, my design fundamentals techer is the set designer for the good morning america show, and did the house modles for the oj simpson trials, how cool is that.  Its raining here... the mall  which is the main campus is under water, it like a big puddle, and the walkway outside the dorm looks like a stream or a really small river.  Oh anyone who would like to send me mail or pic. or stuff should send it to

So anyway... lastnight was the GET LEID party, hosted by the GLBTU   gay lesbian bisexual transgender unity... it was interesting, the most fun was watching the gay guys dance, they had some good moves. SO i guess that was good even tho clarissa wasnt there.  After about an hr, all the dt's left we had our own party called ""freshman roundup"" that was interesting, everyone was drunk except me and like two other people, one of the guys in my class had something like 24 beers and some shots and was so sick... it was actually kind of funny, cause we had to all get up fpr an 830 class. now im not saying that when you get to college or even now you should go and get drunk, but im not saying not to...just what ever you do please do it responsibly, be careful. Im comming home tomorrow so if anyones around and wants to chill for alittle while just give me a call.  
OK  im going back to sleep for a little while  im done  with class for the day
talk to you soon

Secondly i didnt really  know what to say to her... i hate this, this stupid bull...then after about 10 min. of silence, i was like ...i have to go inside, so im closing the window and she yells my name  so i reopen the window, and shes says that she never kissed anyone  while we were in florida. I didnt know what to say ...im so over this crap already, is not in my mind anymore so i was like whatever...and walked away from the window...ahhh"

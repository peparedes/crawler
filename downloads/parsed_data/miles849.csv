"event","For those of you who haven't talked to you on the phone, I am officially enlisted in the army now.  I will ship on June 24, which gives me 22 days to get everything in order, which leaves me with a lot to do in very little time.  YUCK!  Today I took care of student loan stuff, and am waiting for documents to give to the army people.  I have one last job to resign from.  I'll be leaving work earlier, just cause I have to.....  But, that's all fine.  I'll get it together.  Today I went back to Fort Meade, completed the final processing, signed the contract, and was sworn into the Delayed Entry Program.  I also received my list of bands, and I think I'm probably going to go to Germany for the first two years.  I don't think I'll ever have another opportunity to live abroad, but then they'll just toss me wherever they please I suppose.  I changed to a 4 year enlistment, increasing my bonus to 9,000 dollars, and reducing my reserve commitment to 4 years, but regardless, unless I absolutely loath it, I'll re-enlist, since I'll be playing all the time (or so they say....)  I am however happy that I'll be done with the shit shack Sunday.  That is thrilling.  I can't take it anymore, just too much crap for me to deal with, way too much crap.  So, everything is wrapped up, I just have to get my bills all in autopay and make sure there's some money in there to keep things moving while I'm not able to take care of them, but that shouldn't be to much of a problem.  I'm tired, and going to bed now."

"event","Well,
When nothing happens except good stuff for a week, you know it's coming.  Building on the events of the last entry....after my car was towed, I drove to Woodbridge to discover that it wasn't there.  They logically towed it to the one in Falls Church, but they told me differently. BLAAHHHHHHH!!!!!  So, after driving around in my aunt's car (incidentally her AC doesn't work, and it's 95 degrees here with 100 percent humidity) for three hours, and on the verge of heat exhaustion, I went back to work and parked my car to wait for the recruiter from the army to take me to MEPS so I could receive my ASVAB and physical.  I took the ASVAB, and incidentally, think twice about going to music school if you ever consider it.  I don't know anything about car engines, capacitors, alternators, or convection.  My math and verbal were fine though.  By the time my fucking asshole of a MEPS roommate brings his latest jack-off buddy to our room at 2 am, and makes a lot of noise, I'm absolutely thrilled with MEPS.  Then we have to get up a 4 am for breakfast.  We arrived at the hotel at 8 PM, were briefed for almost an hour and fed around 9 pm, giving us the opportunity to get 5 and a half hours sleep.  Thanks to the shit head I was blessed with as a MEPS roommate I received 3 hours of sleep.  Then we had some crappy ass breakfast, were searched, and loaded onto school buses to get back to the MEPS station for an early morning round of poking, prodding, and general molestation.  Anyway, of course my recruiter forgot to send a form in, making it all the more complicated.  I hate incompetence more than almost anything(at this point breathing has replaced it as number one on my top ten list of things about life I hate).  So, after I've been violated in every possible way, they feed us more nasty food, this time in the form of a ham sandwich, which was really, really bad.  I mean, slimy ham, like the kind that my grandfather stores in the fridge for 2 weeks, and washes off so it's ""edible.""  He would still eat it long after the dog refused it.  Except I'm not so sure they washed it off.  YECK!!!  So after this is all done, I'm ready to go home.  But my recruiter isn't there, and when she arrives, she informs me that another recruiter will be carting me home.  He arrives at 4 PM, and we then proceed to sit in rush hour traffic for 2:30 hours to go 50 miles.  YAHOO!!!  He was incidentally the nicest man in the world though.  All of the army personnel that I've met have been very respectful people, and quite genuine, or so they seem.  I've been quite impressed actually.  So he drives me to the lot where my car had been towed to, and surprise, surprise....both of the cars are there, mine and my aunts.  So I get mine, and drive it home, and am hoping to get her's out before 1 am, so it doesn't cost me an extra 25 dollars storage.  But, 100 dollars hasn't magically appeared in my account, so that may not happen, and now I can't drive to work, and I can't go to bed yet, and I'm tired, and pissy and want to blow something up."

"event","So sorry about the week without posts, but nothing dramatic has happened until this weekend.  Well, as usual, things start at the shit shack around 6.  A bunch of illiterate El Salvadorians come into the store and start babbling at me in their hideous language.  Of course I don't understand, so I let the other guy deal with them, and vacuum.  Since we close at 6 pm, I'm especially pissed, since this caused me to be here until almost 7 pm, then getting home at 7:30 pm.  Anyway, that's minor.  The events of the past week include:

My car has a coolant leak into a cylinder, and that means the head gasket is going.  This is shitty because I just had the engine replaced 2 and a half months ago.  So, I left my car parked at work, so that when I found out about the warranty, I could have it towed to the mechanic and fixed.  Well, it got towed, and not to the mechanic.  Now I have to drive to Woodbridge (30 miles from here, of course they took it there, that makes perfect sense, considering there's a Dominion in Falls Church five miles from here) to pay 100 dollars to get my car back, and then have it towed to Lorton to be checked out by the people that put in the engine and have it fixed/replaced again.  I'm pissed needless to say, really pissed.  And there's an exhaust leak besides some potential brake issues.

Happy day"

"event","Well, it's official, my sub-woofer no longer functions.  Miles used it as his personal toilet.  The cat survived (considering this is a powered sub, this is a surprise) but there won't be any bass for a while, at least until I have more than a 45 cent balance in my checking account.  Another day at the shit shack has passed, but definitely not a profitable one.  I did however go grocery shopping thanks to the generosity of my aunt.  La Choy Pepper Steak with vegetables is not worth $4.69, plain rice was definitely tastier.  But, I have pasta and eggs and Dr. Pepper now (my new found favorite soda).  I don't really ever want to see an Ipaq after disassembling it to find out what battery it used, and then discovering we don't carry it and can't order it.  Waste of 1 hour.  Then, a business phone upgrade, potential for another round of grocery shopping, shot down, he wasn't the authorized signer.  So it was a very unproductive, unprofitable day.  I could have slept all day and done nothing, which you already know about if you read last nights post.  Anyway, the army band sent me my information packet, so I e-mailed to set-up an audition.  I have to play a Grade 4 piece, major scales and sight read marches.  Really challenging.  But I'd get a 6,000 dollar signing bonus for a 3 year enlistment.  YAHOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  Also, it rained and it is no longer hot in Northern Virginia.  It is breezy and mild."

"event","Well, unfortunately I didn't update last night when I got home as anticipated, but here I am.  I had a normal putrid weekend at the shit shack.  After playing with the bad commencement orchestra Saturday morning, I went to work.  They were surprised to see me, as it seems, the manager didn't think I'd be in till Tuesday.  A long line of profanity ran through my mind as I imagined myself not doing anything for three days.  Well, so much for that.  I then proceeded to work until 7 pm, and then we went to another store to help with their inventory.  Incidentally, for those of you who don't know what inventory is like at the shit shack, it involves counting button batteries, regular batteries, and other special batteries.  That's in addition to a plethora of cables, and connectors.  Now, it's bad enough that we have to do this at our own store 4 times a year, but then they pop in extra ones when other stores are low on employees.  I have a long list of things I'd rather be doing at midnight on a Saturday, one of them includes peeling off my toenails with rusty tweezers.  So after my 17 hour day from hell, sleep was very necessary.  Did the cat take this into consideration?  No, he would not leave me alone.  At 2 am, he's poking his head in my face, and trying to get me to pet him.  Very annoying, quite cute, but very annoying.  Furthermore, I had to open at eleven am,  I get to work, I'm like 2 minutes late, but no one else bothered to get up and come to work.  So I'm stuck at the shit shack alone for an hour, and of course we have a rush of customers.  My manager finally gets there, and as I'm dealing with the ever growing line of customers, walks to the backroom and does paperwork.  Think Customers First my ass.  And what's more-so, they probably received another notification from Tandy Security because the alarm was disabled after 10:30 am.  And the DSM said whoever was scheduled to open would have to go talk to her at her office, which is in Woodbridge.  That fat ho can go fuck herself with a steak knife.  I was scheduled to be there at 11 am, but then, the manager updated to schedule for that week, allotting me to work at 10:30 am today.  This is of course after the store has already been opened.  So I'm going to get shit for this, and I am very pissed needless to say.  I did however have a nice customer who appreciated my service and tipped me.  Anyway, I'm working from bell to bell tomorrow, and I don't have a day off till Friday.  If anything particularly wretched happens (which I'm sure it will), I'll be updatin' soon."

"event","Today:  Well, not too much exciting happened today.  Went to the shit shack, worked for four hours.  Made 16 dollars or so.  That'll pay for the gas to get there and back maybe.  Then I had to ship something I sold on Ebay.  The people at UPS are so slow.  It takes them forever to do the simplest things.  In the DC area (where I happen to reside), there is an abundant population of black people.  That's right, there are many single mothers named Shanika, with that wonderful attitude we all know and love(the world owes me everything because Tyrice left me with his three children, except two of them are not his, and I'm still quite not sure about the third, we'll have to wait till I can get a free paternity test).  Anyway, not to be a dick about the African-american population here, but there are gobs of them like that, I teach with a bunch of great black people, but that has nothing to do with UPS and how long it takes for them to do their job.  Anyway, there you are.  Then it was back home, where I managed to combine rice, chicken, zucchini, and tomato sauce into dinner.  It was quite good, unfortunately I'm running out of food, and I don't get paid till Thursday.  I guess I'll be eating rice with soy sauce.  It's ghettofabulous, in a Hong Kong sort of way.  Then off to sit in DC rush hour traffic for an hour so I could go to a rehearsal at school for the commencement orchestra, where I was informed that we would hopefully be paid in two weeks.  I thought, hopefully I won't be homeless by then.  It was wretched as all musical events are at the nameless school I'm currently trying to obtain a degree from.  The Army Band is starting to look real good."

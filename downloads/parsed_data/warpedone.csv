"event","Nice little heading there..pretty much says it all about my mood.

Lesse, where to start. Things went down and people wanted to impeach AJ. Rob and the rest of them put up their argument to me and Vikki, and we both asked alot of questions. Vikki asked if their was any other way, like just talking to him..finding out what's going on and getting a temporary fix till everything was back on the up and up. We both went along with it, being told that it was the first step and that it didn't really mean anything except that we wanted what was best for the Frat. Turns out that AJ is now on a Hiatus until his life get back in shape; and I really hope that's soon. He's too good of a guy to see suffer through things.

Next up, we have melodrama with the Ex. She's a nice woman, and I love her to death, but between her and my mother, I swear, I have enough drama to make a cheezy soap. She's going through hell because she wants to see if what she feels for us is real, and she's putting us both through hell to do it. She's seeing this other guy now, guess that's ok. Can't say I'm not jealous because of it...Don't care if I'm not with her. Care more about her being happy than anything. Don't want another guy to fuck up her life, or destroy that self esteeem that's she tried so hard to build up... Whatever, all I can do with that is hope for the best for her heart, and just hope it falls into place into what my heart needs.. Never know what you have till it's gone. It's so true and so sad, but it's the way things are. Oh well, I'm going through that grieving process in the best way that I can handle and I havn't killed anyone yet, so I'm proud of myself for that. Strange, I get to sit here and console her for her thoughts and fears about this new guy..having to keep my own heart in check. Man, having a heart and conscience really sucks. Whatever, it's worth it to see the people you care about be happy. I can bitch and moan about it, but nothing makes me happier than to see someone I care about be happy. Though it makes for a very lonlie path for me..

Some things you don't forget, some feeling or thoughts or people who have had an impact on your life. It's hard for me to forget the people who have changed my life, made me who I am today. Those people probably know who they are, but alot of then will probably surprised.

Anyway, I'm tired, and groggy, so I'm going to bed"

Lesse I talked to Lisa about the resort she would love to create. I personally think it's a wonderful idea. Not many places like that, that I can think of. Got my own little idea of something that I'm almost positive would be a good success. Maybe one day when I get the money to risk.

Had a strange dream last night, but I guess that's what an hour or so of sleep will do to ya. Figure that it's probably just me working through being torn between so many different worlds. It's hard to keep your head in reality when things you feel don't nescessarilly match up to what's really there.

Working on rebalancing my energies. Think these last two years have fucked me up when it comes to my energies...been too scattered and unfocused. Not to mention the few vamps I've run across. Bloody have a part of me crippled because of it.

Strange, most human being would never notice things like that going on through their lives, yet I do. Wonder if that makes me crazy. Heh, if it makes me crazy, it makes most of my closest friends way off the deep end.

Thinking of starting work on my Halloween costume. Gonna sew it together this year cause I think I can do a better job then these $40 pieces of garbage that I see in stores. Got this cloak and this trenchcoat I want to make. Should come out real nice if I take my time on them. Got no clue what I'm gonna make that I have the skill to touch. Can't vacuform for my life and my claywork leaves a bit to be desired anyway.

I really think I need to get into shape. I need to start stretching and get that agility and strength I had in highschool back. Hell, could do a backflip at that point; now my back would kill me if I tried. Maybe I'll grab those martial arts classes I was thinking about. Don't like mass teaching like that, but it accomplishes the means, I guess I don't have a choice.

Need to get some 480 titanum of Steel one day. Really want to make a sword like the ones in my head and that dragon dagger I have in my sketchbook. So sue me, if technology crumbles I'll be realy to be gladiator. I just like swords better than gun. Which reminds me, I need that leather plate armor. Bah I hate riviting those things together. Figure it will cost me at least 400 less if I can do it myself. 

Maybe that's the kind of stuff I should do with my life. Should make things like that. Way out of practice with things like that and sewing. Maybe in 2 weeks when I get some money together. Heh, wonder how my art prof would like comming in with custom body armor, bet she's never had that happen before. Might haveto do it now just to see the look on her face.

Anyway, things are going like the should in my life. Can complain, but I don't feel like complaining today. It's been a good day overall. Anywhol, I should go to bed for the night. Got a day of classes taht I want to be awake for and have patience for."

"event","This probably won't make sense to alot of people, and for that I apologise, however, people will know who this applies to...
   I'm going to tell you all a story, a story I've kept locked in my heart for several years, and I feel that this is the best way to say thank you for it. So many years ago, I was very new to the game that I guess you could call life. Like several in life, I gave up a good portion of my childhood to grow up sooner than I had to. Being a child like this, it is difficult to control feelings at that age...including the feeling of desperation and lonlieness. At one point, I think everyone questions that reason to continue; that reason to continue existing a life that seems to be constantly be filled with newer and increasingly difficult challanges. I definately did. I wondered what could cause that sort fo pain, a pain that I blame partially for my anxiety in life today. Looking back on it now, I undestand it better now than I ever did, but when I was that young, I didn't understand it at all. I had gotten to the point where I became apathic and stoic to everything..fighting against my own feelings and needs. It has gotten to the point where I bother figuratively, and literally fell. I found myself surprised who was there to help me stand up again..a relative stranger I had only met a few months earlier, who was willing to give everything that they had and more to insure that I did not give up. For that, I am eternally greatful, and I just want to say thank you.

   I do have anxiety and it is something that is crippling in my life and unfortunately it is something that has slowly gotten worse as I have gotten older. I refuse to go to a doctor for it because I don't want to take those medications..they ruin who people are, change their personalities, and I would rather be a little fearful and uncertain than not know or understand who I am. So, I'm probably going to be spending alot of time in the near future trying to conquer this anxiety, or at least curtail it. Strange. I have no qualms physically fighting with someone, but when it comes to being judged I become terrified..start shaking and everything. Definately something I'm going to haveto work on to fix in the near future.

   Thankfully I'm working on my art this semester. I'm hoping that I can become confident in my abilities to open an art store for some comissions by may of next year. Sort of a suppliment to what I make now, but with me doing something I can really enjoy. Gotta map out a website and all that, but I don't think that's too hard..got alot of that built into my head already.

  I think someone up there must really like me, cause when I've needed people the most, they've come out of the woodwork just in the nick of time to remind me of things I have forgotten. It's so rare that I can meet people that understand me completely, my motivations, and my reasonings for everything..even the BS I throw around sometimes. I can probably name 3 people, maybe 5...if I really, really stretch that know me..and two at best the really understand me. Thanks you guys for being you. You've had that impact on my life that I don't think I'll ever really forget.

  Hmm, for a quote today...hmm ""Everything happens for a reason."" Simple, sweet and fairly deep.
   For a game of the day..how about Tetris. Everyone's had that one game of violent competition with a friend who you cursed out when they just barely beat you..
   Finally, a site of the day..give pennyarcade.com a go. A pretty funny site. Favorite line from that ""The tube is civilization!"" Meh, but you wouldn't understand that unless you read it, so go give it a good read."

"event","Bah, just getting around to updating this things. How to start..well, work sucks, life suck and school sucks is a nice strong start. My brother got married, was the happiest day that I can remember. Ceremony was really nice, but it makes me wonder how in the world my parents could have afforded it when we can't even afford a new roof in our house. 
Started a new job in June. I can definately see why the people before me quit; the bosses don't do anything and push back the work onto everyone else. Sounds like real fun, don't it? Anywho, I'm already in search of a new job cause working 5 hours a day, 7 days a week and always clocking in 10 hours of overtime for my paycheck, leaves a bit to be desired.
In other news, I've been working on BE on Star Wars Galaxies. Bote seems happy about that one and guarantees that he'd be a customer to me. Just gotta figure out how I'm going to price things on that merchant...
Still trying to get things about my school and life organised. Way it looks, on tuesday I'm spending 10 hours there till Christmas. Not my idea of fun, but hell, I wind up spending that much time there normally just hanging out. Just getting life organised after my nervous breakdown last year. And lemme give a bit of advice, if anything is going to push that to happen to you, it is NOT worth it at all. Your health is not a good way to pay for anything, nomatter how much you think you may like it.
Looking to pick up an Envirnmental Science Degree now. Really puts be behind the 8 ball, so I'm definately going to haveto work my but off to get what I haveto get done, done right.
Been playing Doom 3; and it definately isn't a bad game. A bit dark for my taste, but it definately sets up that ""hopeless"" mood for you. Can't wait to see what the mods for it look like.
My girlfriend, well, I probably haveto thank her alot for the way she's been with me. Almost 3 years with her and I don't think I could be getting through life without her. She definately knows how to put things in perspective to see what hasto be done, and know when to stop being so brash, and baby me a bit. She had alot of doubts about us, and our relationship, because of the bloody distance between us, however, I'm glad that she recently realised how much she did care, and is slowly realising who she is, compared to who people tell her to be. Can't tell you how happy it makes me feel to see people grow like that.

Anywho, I'm going to be late for work, so I better close this up. So a real quick game and quote. 

Game of the day: Starcraft...The first strategy game I feel was ""done right"". Different feel of races and no ""uber"" weapons or units

Quote of the day: ""I felt my heart jump for joy when I saw the shotgun laying under my buddies corpse. Sorta like a bithday gift. Made me feel like my odds of getting out of this just rose alot""

Give a cookie to whoever can figure out where that quote is from."

"event","World must be comming to an end...oh well, Praxa  did bring up a good point, that I never said exactly what's been making things so hard, so I suppose I might as well elaborate.
Where to start? well, I suppose the best place to start is last semester at school. If you know me, you know I am a dedicated worker and quite a perfectionist. Things started with me trying to juggle work and and school and having some sort of life. Well it goes without saying that I failed. My GPA went down and I wound up being more frustrated because everything I found myself doing was unfufilling. 
Maybe it was fear, or just stubborness, but I refused to listen to my heart and continued on the path I was on; a path leading toward self destruction.  One thing I should have learned a long time ago that I'm only just now forcing myself to learn is to love myself. Yes yes, arrogant Chris has alot less self confidence than I would have most people believe. I like to think I'm overcomming that now..I sure hope I am.
Things got interesting this semester, because I didn't try to fix anything that was wrong, and things just got worse and worse. Now, I find myself dug into a grave that will take nothing short of a miracle to dig myself out of in time; but it can be done, and I'll just haveto do it, simple as that.

Anyway, enough about school, and onto something I don't really enjoy talking about. Some of you may know this, some of you may not, but I am an adopted child. Most people that aren't probably think that isn't a big deal, but it really is, at least to someone as inquisitive as me. Think about it like this, imaging yourself not having a past or future..not knowing a thing about where you're from or where you're going. I've always lived off of the belief that family is in your friends, but blood is still blood, if only for health reasons it is something that should be known, least I feel so.. People can look at their parents and get an idea at what their good at, about how their going to look when they grow up, about whether they have a higher risk for Cancer or AIDS. I can't do that. I haveto rely on myself for that. However the question still remains in my mind, and no, it isn't something I can simply put off to the side, and I won't until I get those answers; be them for better or worse.

People have always asked why I treat my parents the way I do. How I can be such a nice person but still be so rude and immature to them. It's not on purpose, it's mental...guess a bit of subconscience resentment.

I do apologise for all of this ranting, I know most people don't care about it, or care to read it, but still, it's what I'm thinking.

Lesse, what else is eating me...well, I'm not happy with the path I've chosen in life. I chose a path of logical idiots. That path doesn't meet my heart and I'm only just now realising it. My path lies more with the natural than the logical. It's not an easy transition for me because I was always taught to do things logically and only logically, yet I always tried to act by my heart, creating a conflict...I'm just a living paradox, aren't I? Sorry if this still seems vague, but I'm working through it, so not everything has fallen into place just yet. Hopefully it will and I'll be able to move on with this chapter in my life.

Quotable Quote of the Day:
""Friends tell you what your afraid to tell yourself.""
""Love is the greatest weapon. It can bring life and destroy worlds.""
""Pressures, understandings, stresses, in the end, doing what your heart tells you is what takes them away.""

Alright and Finally, my game of the day:
Keeping once again with my old school theme, Zelda. This game stirrs up childhood memories in everyone. Who can possibly forget that overworld theme

Oops, I forgot a website of the day yesterday, so here's 2!
www.bakaneko.com Very good artist

"event","I'd like to start this off by saying I'm sorry. I sorry for everyone I've hurt and worried in life so far, particularly with the disappearing acts I tend to pull when things get tough. I don't mean to worry anyone and it does mean alot to me that you people do care. You people know who you are, and for your kindness, I thank you.
Life is a strangee thing, it always tosses you a curve right when the timing couldn't be worse. I'm finally noticing the circle of self destruction that I've been living in for suck a long time; and it amazes me that the friends I do still have, I well, still have. 
So, what's been going on in my life, for those I don't get the chance to inform every week or so? Well, I'm still trying to figure that out myself. I'm just really not happy with life right now. Probably one of those emotional breakdowns that people said I would have eventually, but I'm recouperating from that. I'm really lonely, having my girlfriend so far away still, and it makes me worry that she's ok and hurts when I know I can't be there when she needs me. Just yesterday was her birthday, and I couldn't do anything more than call and say Happy Birthday.
Ever get the feeling that you're in a place where you don't belong? That you would rather be someplace else. I'm feeling like that more and more. Guess I'm not as much of a city person as I've been raised to be.
Anyway, I need to say I'm sorry again for seemingly being so cynical all the time. I'm really not. I do like to look on the bright side of life, it's just easier for me to write down the bad things than actually say them.
On the brighter side, I am getting things in order, slowly but surely, and hopefully by the end of this summer I'll be set for a while, so long as I keep my stress level at a minimum.
Y'know, I think that's my problem, I keep too much stress in my life and I worry too much. That's what I get for being nice, I guess; but that's who I am, so that isn't going to change anytime soon. I think Kamal said it best, ""It's all just a part of growing up."" Funny, how you always get good advice from where you least expect it.

Anyway, enough Gripeing, onto the last little tidbut I seem to be in a habit of doing. For our quote of the day:
""It's better to live on your feet, than to die on your knees.""

Next item up, my game of the day, week, month, whenever I update next:
In keeping with nostalgic games, I'm going to haveto go with DooM. It created the FPS popularity that wolfenstein and several others helped lay the foundation for. Thank you ID Software, without you I'd probably not have nightmares of being trapped in Human BBQ surrounded with Imps and Pinkies. Thank you for the ambience the scared every 9 year old, and thank you for making such a kick ass game that I continue to torture myself with each day.

Anyway, I'm gonna head out, I have some work to do, so I will talk to you all when I do."

It's stupid little things that do it too; little acts of kindness and thoughtfullness. People really don't appreciate those little things enough.

Anyway, it's been a good weekend, but I still havn't been feeling like myself. Maybe it's the weather, or me frustrating myself. I don't know. I'd say I need a vacation, but I don't really think I'm that stressed; just not all that focused on this, but at least that's getting better for me. 

If anyone can think of something for me to rant about, feel free to IM or Mail me your ideas. 

Before I forget, I have a character on Go-Gaia.com which is my website plug for the day. It's interesting. I would like it if it were a bit easier to make some gil though.

"event","I am such a weak person; physically, mentally, and emotionally. Over the last few months, I've been torn and pulled through so many different emotions..loss of loved ones, troubles at home, with friends, with the people I love and care for. I have nothing left. I have nothing left to give. No more strength to try and help people with their burdens. I can no longer carry my own. I hate weakness; hate incompetance; and I am both. Biggest problem I've always had was being to arrogant and thinking I could handle everything. For a long time, I believed it. I believed that I could pull off anything, that the strength of the soul was more than enough to keep me going until I could finally get some rest. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. 
     I have fallen. I fell a long time ago. Only now am I realising it. How ignorant of me. I've been such a fool for so long. Always being nice, always giving everyone the benifit of the doubt, and turning the other cheek. But now much cheeks are raw and bloodcovered. One can only turn the other cheek so many times before it's all they can stand. I think that now I understand why people can be so selfish and self serving; it's just so much easier seeing everyone and everything as something inferior that you should rule over. That isn't me though;  hopefully it will never be me.
     Every part of my body is exhaused. Why do I go on? most people would try hard to find a reason; but I have those people I love, whom I would in an instant give my life to them, that I would trust my life and future in their hands. Friends, family, life, love..they do exist for a reason...hope.
     Long ago, when all was innocent and pure, a young princess found a mysterious golden box. In her curiosity, she opened this box and from it sprung forth all the evils of the world: Lust, greed, envy, hate. All that was left in the box was a single thing, a single ray a light; a ray of hope. That is why I live, to be that light to those who can't find it on their own. To help them find their path when all they see is darkness.
     Now I find that my light is fading and I look around and see no one willing to shed some of their light on me. What a lonely path it is. Such a hard path to understand that I chose to undertake. Yet it is my path and I shall stick to it, nomatter what. To do otherwise, would be a crime in and of itself.
     I used to pride myself on being able to be strong for everyone. To always be that pillar to lean on. Now I feel myself tumbling with nothing to stop me from shattering like glass.  I'll live though. I always do.


Because I'm feeling like a thinker right now, three quotable quotes:

""For what good is it to a man to inherit the world but lost is own immortal soul"" (Matthew 16:26)
""A man is at his tallest when he kneels down to help someone""
""Evil may lie in the hearts of man but good rests in their souls.""

Next up is my Web page recommendation:
http:://www.elgoonishshive.com
Comedy with a plot on the web. Who knew?

Finally, my Video Game recommendation:
I'm going to go old school with this one. You people can flame me from now until doomday but the fact still remains: Final Fantasy 4 is one of the top 3 RPG's of all time. If you havn't played it, you're missing out on alot. You people that started RPG's with Final Fantasy 7: play 4, ignore the graphics and watched the plot. You'll realized you've come across a treasure of storyline equil to that of an award winning novel. 

Oh and one last thing. Play 4 so you at least can understand when the level 65 bard in EQ is calling you a Spoony Bard."

Oh BTW, I'm looking for stuff to draw and may actually start doing comissions soon so if you have an idea, feel free to message me or leave a note on my journal. One of these days I'll need to get a better gallery for my art, but until then, I'll post what I can. Anywho, I think I'm not making sense any more so Goodnight

"event","well, another day, another waste of time. Sitting here at my computer, watching people argue. Is humanity really that ignorant? To start fight over things so petty as them wanting to fight? Doesn't make sense to me. 
Been writing my paper for English. I'll hand it in on Wedenesday. I don't have the patience to sit through it.
On the plus side, my friend might be moving up here to go to school. To say I havn't see him in a long time is a understaement. Hope things go through.
Been talking to Allie alot lately. Probably going to call her again tonight. I swear, she really brings out alot in me. I cry alot more now that I know her, and I'm glad I do. I have a few promises I haveto keep with her that I think I'll make good on tonight.
Found out that everyon is going over Jason's house. Funny how I'm specifically alienated from all of my friends. Kinda makes you rething what you call a freind. But they are allowed to go and do whatever it is they want, so I have no right to complain."

Not much to reallly say. Been a really up and down day. Was supposed to hang out with my friends like they promised, but they'd rather hang around with Jason. Must have  a really bad ability to choose friends. Oh well, can't let that keep me down. Spent too long digging myself out of that hole for me to go back into it.

"event","Things in life are very tedious, and monotonous. People live in their own little worlds, expecting everyone, and everything to bend to their will. This is the problem with the world, we are afraid to fail. 
   Someone at work quit today, she couldn't handel the pressure and plain nastiness of our manager. I can't blame her. I would have been gone a long time ago, but I need this job, if only to keep my promise. On another note, my manager is pregnant with twins, amazingly enough, so congrats to her, and good like to Terisa, she'll need it to put up with everything.
   Is it wrong to miss people? I really miss Allie. It's been so long since I've been around her, yet, she is one of the only things that can get a real smile out of me. The only thing that can get me to keep going and working. For that, I thank her more than anything. If you ever do read this Allie..Kris, I love you, and miss you.
   Sorry in advance if this suddenly gets depressing. I'm finding that I do suffer from bouts of depression. Probably from thinking way too much.
   My friend came down tonight, I got to see him. He came in with Jay and Jay, unfasionably late, as always. Me and that kid don't get along anymore. He says I've changed. Have I? I just don't know. I'm guess I'm the kind of person you either love, hate, or couldn't care about. Personally, I really don't think I'd care, so long as they were honest enough to tell me.
   Well, before I talk myself into a depression, I'm going to go and get my English HW done. Take care all.."

"event","Another day with just about no revenue. It's horrible not having a full college education. The job market is murder, specially since I can't drive anywhere. Oh well, nice day at work and school. Only went to one class today though, swear, college is a waste of money. Everything I'm being taught I already know. Will probably get harder, so I might as well count me blessings. Wonder if it's good that my feet are still throbbing from not siting down. Is that a bad thing?
Had a nice conversation with Jeff today after work. Kinda funny having a scientist and a mage comparing notes and agreeing. Think I confused him with my philosophy though. Maybe that's just cause I think too much.
Then again, I'm so frickin filled with magic theory and thoughts, it's ridiculous. You'd think I'd been studying for years, but, oh well, to each their own. Not like I have the strength, of resources to pull any of it off. Who knows, maybe one day I will.
You know what, that's something I'd really want to do. I'm want to teach people things like meditation and magicks, and occult. Heck, my beliefs don't really fit into anything, and I can't write them, someone would haveto help me get them down. I'm sure this isn't surprising Ani for me to say. I tend to sound redundant in my thoughts, but, oh well.
Well, my train of though is totally shot, so I'll proably post again if I can get this thought out of my head."

new things in my world:
i live in houghton with a roommate in a sunny and nicely sized apartment.  i work in two labs doing water testing for the portage lake/ lake superior waterways that are so crucial for this region.  my labs are biology and chemistry and i test water with fluorometers, spectrometers, conductivity meters, i test for the thermocline and try to determine the amount of mixing that goes on between the different bodies of water including feeder rivers like sturgeon, pilgrim and traprock.
that is not very interesting to you i am sure.  
other than that i spend most of my time chilling with friends.  we do a lot of community cooking and having each other over for dinner and some beers.  the weather is finally summer here, so swimming in portage lake and on lake superior are regular activities.  the water here is so clean (i know because i test it!) and so is the air.  
twice a week i go and play soccer with the grad students and international kids, and i love it because i can only usually understand a third of what is said on the field.  we'll go and have bonfires or whatever together too.  
before i came up here i went on a road trip with brendan from scotland and roderick from spain.  we hit every state from here to tijuana and back.  
highlights:
arches national park in utah and climbing on the arches after driving all night the night before and stopping to look at the stars
getting drunk with bryan hart and nikki in the grand canyon.  bryan was a stoned out guy who loved jumping.  he would jump on anything... over picnic tables, up trees, off cars, onto cars, probably into the grand canyon, i dont know!  he spelled his name bryan because ""there is no i in brian"" and he said that people that listen to fast paced music live longer.
seeing an amazing lighting and thunderstorm near a lake in oaklahoma.  we slept in the car that night to the sounds of rain and thunder.  
brend the mongoose and roderick the pirate prince in their aviator shades trying to pick up the ladies.
all of san diego
getting waay burned on the beach in san diego
swimming in the lake in amarillo texas and not seeing any ""boofallow"" (as roderick pronounces it)
going to las vegas, seeing the lights and playing beer pong in a bar/casino there
meeting sandy as i was upset and drunk outside and hearing her story of living in thailand and coming to america alone eight years ago
seeing wide open lands and huge skies
accidentally going to tijuana and getting drunk there on a monday night. we hit a rock bar, a local's bar with an old drunk woman and a horney drunk man.  i told the horney drunk man that i was married to both brend and roderick and he called me a puta.  i jokingly yelled at him in spanish for it. then he asked the boys which one was first!
then we hit a gay bar and i danced with some gay men until they asked the boys to dance and the boys wanted to leave.
then to my very first strip joints... the second one we were so wasted we all were falling asleep in the bars!
on our walk back the boys were patted down twice by police men.  the second time i stumbled up to an officer and said 'hablo espanol, pero estoy muy barracha'  and they laughed at me for a long time.  i dont remember it.  i'm not evensure how we made it back to our hotel... but we did.
getting back out was sketchy too.
picking up a lady hitchiker who had conceiled in her purse a tarantula.  she was fuckin psycho.
it was an amazing trip.
more happened, and if you want details you'll have to ask because i am sick of typing things in here."

ugh.

its like looking at a picture of yourself from a very awkward stage in your life. 

in any case, college has been a very wonderful experience so far.  i'm also ready to visit home for a bit.  its amazing how easy it is to adapt to a new place and new people.  it feels like i'm living a double life: my home life and my here life.

"event","today, a fun day, was worth rising early for.

i captured my brother and shaunae, and went to school to direct traffic for yearbook, which was fine.  instead of parking in student parking, i left my car in visitors, in front of school.  i am so badass.  i'm even more badass because i didnt wear the lame yearbook tee shirt that i was supposed to.  it was purple and said ""live for the moment"" on its front.  so i wore an old one to show that even though i was lazy, i was old and therefore still had senority.  after first hour started and all our customers left to go to class, kari and i went to micky d's and had a breakfast date.  we read the sports, and all of the results of monday night's track meet.  Its nice to see friends of yours in the paper.  it makes me proud.

then i went to third hour, which was relatively painless, and didnt go to fourth, because i am done with media study.  then, hoooray.  they most badass thing i did today:  i took a DOUBLE LUNCHHHHH  hahahaha. yeah, i am the kid who doesnt skip school a lot, so i had never taken a double lunch before.  yes, i had skipped, but never a double lunch.  so i joined the tuesday lunch girls at china buffet.  Kari, April and Amber are good lunchmates.  we pretended to be in middle school and had to be in a giant herd.  

and then physics, where max taught me how to make paper talk.  and i made it move its eyes.  and then art, where i realized, wow, i am not going to finish my project, and hopefully mrs mannenbach will take pity on me and not give me a C.  yeah.  i can deal with b's, but c's are too low for me.  i am not accustomed to not doing well.  

then soccer, where we did some fun stuff.

and then i made cookies for all the teachers who wrote me reccomendations for college to thank them.  i also made cookies for mr walker, because i am his guardian angel.  i bet he'll like them better than anything i could buy for him. those are damned good cookies.

i want to write about physics day.  as much as rollercoasters make me scared, i had a blast that day.  Stephanie Weber and i Hung out all day, being wild and riding rides.  i was so glad she was gung ho about going on rides, because it made it so much easier for me to just go along.  every time i hear the ""hips dont lie"" song i think of that place and the good times and good  hummus we had.  and you know, when you stand in lines for most of the day, its really good to have pleasant and interesting company.  i'm glad i decided to go.

this weekend i saw berken at the lorelei.  the resturaunt is more a pub, and well known by erich bacher for its guinness,and small.  the band played in this tiny corner, and everyone else stood or sat crammed into the little room.  and yet, while it was like one of those sliding puzzles where you have to make a picture but only have one blank spot,and to move one peice all the other peices have to move, i enjoyed myself.  i went with ruthann, and we saw a a bunch of people there.  John Krouth (brother of the guys in the band), danielle stoll, katie tyson, Patricks Kenny and Fritz Morkin, Bridgette douthett, lisa Zychowski and erich bacher.  From Erich we learned many fun stories about Ruthann's Sister carrie's exploits as a teenager, and old Mr walker stories.  some teachers came too, including mrs huelskamp, mr polka and MR KREIG.  hah.  i pounded his fist and he shook his head.  apparantly he doesnt pound anything.

speaking of which:  once, as i left physics, i almost walked into Ben Russ high fiving with Mr. Krieg.  Mr. Krieg would put both his hands low, and ben would slap them, then he would put his hands up, and ben would slap upwards, but awkwardly.  and then they would try to do a complex handshake, and mr krieg would confuse his fingers and just smile.  hahaha, it had to be the funniest thing i have ever seen coming out of a physics class.

now i have a black toe.

and i cannot wait to graduate."

"event","Ruthann and i finally finished the retirement video.  we made a video of all the retired teachers to show at the dinner, which was this past wednesday.  the number of hours we put into that thing are astronomical.  i was a complete pest at ruthann's house, keeping her up to all hours of the night multiple times a week.  pretty sure it never would have been done if ruthann hadnt helped me!  i wasnt able to (and didnt desire to) go to the dinner to see how the movie was recieved, but nonetheless, i was apprehensive about the teacher's reception of the movie.  

so i had this dream about it.  i had a dream wednesday night that i was at school thursday morning and a
lot of teachers liked it.  they gave us nice compliments.  then missy nelson came up to me and said ""Mr. thompson really liked the movie, and he wants to go on vacation with you.""  

wierd."

in my khaki pants, 
nothing better 
whoo whoo whoo! 
girls ask the guys, 
always a suprise, 
theres nothign better, 
baby do you like my sweater?

we play a lot of soccer, given that we had a tourney this past weekend in janesville, and three games this week.  two games on this weekend and three games next week.  thats a hella lotta soccer.

i went running after our game last night because i hadnt gone for a run in awhile.  it was intended to be a really easy nice calm relaxing one, but instead it became a race between myself and the streetlights.  i got a little excited, i would say.

then i snuck up on my brother, very low to the ground, crouching and scuttling and shifty eyed.  so sneaky i am.  my father said that i must have had a good run because of how silly i was acting, chasing him around the house like that.

now daniel is gone, because he is with ben russ at trees for tommorow.  i am jealous, estoy celosa porque cuando yo era ese edad, yo no tenia interes en arboles para manana.  y yo no vaya.  

i cant remember conjugation.  whoops.  brain in the toilet.  there are so many young girls interested in that boy ben russ, and he doesnt even know it.  aww, its cute.  ben russ and i really like the onion, because its amazing.  read the one about evagelical physicists if you havent yet. no, its not preporting to be a real newspaper.  if you think that, you are not paying attention.  they take real news, and spin it in a hilarious but satirical manner.  sometimes they are just absurd in their character creations.

speaking of characters, i've been a member of the comedy city high school leauge (an improvisational comedy troupe) since i was an impressionable freshman and the club was downtown.  now i am a senior, and the senior show is coming soon.  may 6th at 6 o'clock to be exact.  show up, because the cost is nothing and the entertainment will be provided by all the most experienced members of the troupe.  this includes myself, and my best friends, amber, ruthann and allison.

my mother left her purse at church.  i just got the call.  i left my purse in my calculus classroom once.  how scary that was.  i am not a girl who carries a large purse wiht many things inside.  i carry a small one containing only important things! a loss of my purse catostrophically alters my day.

someone said today that they would be lost wihtout their cell phone.  others agreed.  what an odd phenomenon.  

so there is that sadie hawkins dance.  anyone going?  apparantly sadie hawkins means girls have to ask boys to this dance.  too bad i just learned today.  i am a senior, so i go for free!  plus there is ice cream.  i wouldnt want to ruin my girlish figure.  oi!  who am i joking.  i'd eat the ice cream anyhow.  i like to dance, dancing is fun.  i'll probably go, just to dance.  plus, who can turn down free?  

and then there is the car.  its died on sunday, and i almost had a fit.  you know when something stupid happens at the wrong time and you just become so enraged that you annoy yourself? well, the car died right at the wrong time.  we gave it a jump and its all better now, but i had to drive over 20 miles before i could turn it off.  so ruthie and i went to freedom.  FREEDOM!  yess.  its a much bigger town than anyone ever expected.  three gas stations, man!

done talking for now.  this was really pointless except as a time waster in avoiding teaching myself double integrals for polar coordinates.  we have a test tommorow.  i'm going to fail."

i am so glad the media study project is done, because it was such a stressful project.  another thing to keep me awake at night when i glaze over the events of the day, and worry about the things not finished.

this is the time to start to feel like quitting life.  to decide to skip going to college in favor of being a bum.  to do nothing with my life.  will the work be worth the reward? and what if its not?  what if the work is all a waste?  thats what i worry about in life.

i'm pretty sure i'll take math over again in college.  whichever college i decide on.  probably michigan tech.  probably not eau claire or carleton.  

hey.  can i ask you a question?

what do you do when you want to escape monotony?"

"event","The largest ski race in america, and the fifth largest in the world, the Birkebeiner took place on this past saturday.  The Birkie spans the 52 kilometers, or approximately 26 miles, between the cable airport and the main street of hayward, wisconsin.  I skied the kortelopet, the younger sister of the birkie.  It's a mere 23 kilometer (or 13 mile) race, referred to by racers as ""the short one"".  i finished in about 1:42, which isn't  great, but everone's times were about seven to nine minutes slower than normal, so hopefully i make second wave.

Other members of the team competed: rachel demerath, kyle demerath, brian pliner, melanie hoffman, jojo sumnicht, robyn lauritzen, aron block, my brother daniel, and max renner.  if you see any of them, tell them they are awesome.  this race is one of the most amazing things you can experience.

if you ever have a chance, just come to watch.  watch the start, and watch at the top of one of the powerline hills.  then go into hayward and watch the finish. the italians won again this year, but they crossed holding hands. 

a variety of things besides just ski racing went on this weekend.  my family and max stayed in a condo at the main lodge from thursday night to sunday morning.  the lodge is the place to be on birkie weekend.  they have expos and free stuff.  i got a free back massage, some stickers, cookies, and an awesome hat, which i raced in.

max and i volunteered at bib pickup and saw a lot of people, including abby paye.  its fun to volunteer there because you are a part of such a huge and complicated system, as well as meeting really fun and wild ski people.  max always says skiers are the wierdest people he has ever met.  its true.  we  met a french canadian couple, and we asked them about a few phrases that we knew.  i asked them about (please exuse my french) ""ce ruelle me puelle""  which supposedly means ""roll my chicken"".  the woman laughed uproariously.  i am hoping it was at the pure absurdity of the phrase, and not that it was some sort of obsure french come on.

max was also able to ""obtain"" a huge fisher banner to hang in his room.  the security guards almost caught us, but we went out the back way with the banner up max's coat, but hanging suspiciously out the bottom.  

i also almost crashed the car again.  max, daniel and i were going to the cottage of our former ski coach on saturday night and i was driving much to fast around a curve.  the car started to weave  back and forth across the road, until we sideswiped a snowbank on the side and i remember that i had brakes.  everyone was completely silent and unpreturbed until we thought about what had happened afterwards.  then i was completely freaked out and drove 25 the whole rest of the way.

my favorite part was when Ruthann and her parents flew in her dad's plane to the race, and landed in cable.  Ruthann and i cheered on the top of the last hill for all the tired tired people.  they were really funny and happy about us cheering for them.  we sang ""we are the champions"" ""eye of the tiger"" and that one song that says ""aint nothing gonna break my stride, aint nothin gonna slow me down...""  the people liked it.  afterwards, i talked to one of my best skiing friends, dawn passineau, and ruthanns dad offered to take us for a ride in his plane.  ruthann, dawn and i went flying!  we saw the finish, the lodge, all the tiny skiers!  then we flew three minutes to hayward (usually a half hour drive) and watched the birkie finishers from the air.  flying in a private plane is nothing like the pressurized cabin of a jumbo jet.  its small and bumpy and completely awesome. 

this has been really long.  if you made it here i hope you enjoyed it!"

"event","state cross country skiing:

we left thursday morning after calc, and drove to the shwann center.  The schwann center is a retreat convention center with the ski trails used for the state cross country ski meet.  thursday we skied the course in our beautiful pink cheetah print tights.  we looked amazing.  i'll post a picture as soon as i upload one.

skiing meets run are a little different from most other individual competitive sports.  We ski two races, skate and classic on back to back days, and have awards for skate, classic and the overall pursuit time.  on friday we raced skate.  two at a time, every thirty seconds races left the start line.  this makes racing much less a chase, and more a mental ""push yourself as hard as you can go"" game.  you dont have anyone to race except the person you are seeded against, whoever you catch and whoever catches you.  if someone catches you, you can be sure they have already beat you, because they started at least 30 seconds behind you, if not more.  its difficult to push yourself when you cannot gauge where you are in the pack.

the day was really tough.  it had snowed four inches overnight, and although they groomed the course, the uphills (of which there was a proliferation) were chopped and sandy-snowed.  the course was slow!  i did not prepare myself mentally to give it all that i had, and dissapointed myself with a 62 place finish.  i was mad.  i was upset.  i have been skiing the state championships for seven years, and i should know better that to let myself start with a race like that.  so i cried, and i resolved to have my best race of the year the next day.

for the classic day, it was amazing.  it was my last high school race ever.  i was jumping around and singing before the race.  in pursuit format, wherever you end the day before is where you start the next day.  if your chip time was five seconds slower than the person in front of you, you start five seconds after them.  Its really exciting, beceause you can see the people you need to catch.  i left the starting line double poling like a hurricane.  when i need to double pole fast, i count to myself in sets of eight, as quickly as a can.  i caught ten people in the first kilometer.  in the next six and a half, i caught 10 more people, including two in the stadium, where everyone could see i was burning up the track. i couldnt stand after my race, and that is such a good feeling. 

my overall pursuit place was 42, a place i am not happy about, but willing to live with.  my classic place was 34th, a place i am proud of.  i skied my best classic race ever, and took another step closer to skiing as hard as i possibly can, and performing to the apex of my abilities.  improvement is all i ask of myself."

"event","According to my dove chocolate, yesterday was a day for a long bubble bath.  The dove chocolate said that i deserved the bubble bath.  i chuckled when i read that.  i hadn't had a good day, and no one really cared.  although i didnt expect anyone to.  we all have our troubles, some greater than others, and that is our lot.  we must deal with it.  
so, had i attempted to describe my day, or the past set of days to anyone, they would not have been impressed with its magnitude of upsettingness.  In reality, nothing that happened in my day had been particularly awful or unusually bad.  so i conclude that the only difference between my good days and my bad days is how i react to the things that happen in those days.

i'd take this into examples, but i have to leave.

so make your day the best you can."

"event","going to madison this weekend was fun!  we went to ski, and they brought in all this snow from area parking lot mountains, tyrol basin, and a bunch of snow that they kept on a frozen lake and put it on the streets surrounding the capital.  we skied our loop around the capital and a bunch of people came to watch. 
 
i like how many people are in madison, and how they will talk to you.  so we went shopping, maxwell and i.  i bought a shirt and he bought some supercool glasses, a bandana in yellow and sweet glasses.  we looked at so many hats, and almost got him a haircut.  we met a fellow who had once been a dj, and he said his worst djing time was for a group of 11 year old cheerleaders.  i felt so bad for him.  hah, when i asked him if he had been one of those kids in high school who could play any and all instruments, he said, ""no, i was the kid who read all the time"". hahahha. we also met a guy who told us to enjoy life, and that plays were better than movies. he composed a song for us about skiing.  we had to tip him, or he wouldnt play it. 

we also had a dance party, which half the fun of was convincing all the people it was okay to dance in front of other people.  we had kids from minnesota, madison, hayward, lakeland, and some other places that i dont remember.  it was a good time, and we had lots of smiles.  however, i am looking forward to next weekend, after this week of finals.  damnitall.

we had two races this weekend in conserve and rhinelander.  back to back.  one saturday and one sunday.  thank god we have such a fun team this year, or we all probably would have died!  

i took 8th of 60 or so at conserve and somewhere like 15th out of 70 at rhinelander.  if i was just a couple seconds faster per kilometer, i would have been top ten probably.  its a point i need to work on. 

we stayed at a place called treehaven out in the middle of nowhere.  we played darts. i am really bad at darts.  and max and kyle had the slowest, most boring game of checkers ever.  but it was fun to watch and make fun of.  
literally no one else besides us was there.  we arrived in the dark, and we all were thinking about the shining and scary men in the woods.  we couldnt even lock the building or our room.  its a wonder any of the girls slept.  i dont think boys think about stuff like that, so they werent scared and screaming. 

all in all, a good weekend."

it feels wierd now to be so old.  to be a senior.  i went up to third floor, just for the hell of it, so i could walk and see all the underclassmen, and remember when i spent a lot of time there.  i tried to remember what things were like, and what my freshman year was like. i dont remember most of freshman year.  its like a black hole or something.  

i remember meeting ashley v. in gym and being embarassed for never remembering her name.  i also remember tanya and tessa and ashlyn in mr rosinski's class.  i hated that class, it was boring and i hate mr rosinski.  i bullshitted all of my assignments for that class.  i had 6th hour lunch, which was terrible.  i remember we would sit around and everyone was bitchy.  then i went to math with caitlin and dave and the girl who played ado annie.  dave did calculator tricks and caitlin and i talked all the time.  or slept.  hah.  

i think i lived in a world all my own that year.  i didnt talk to anyone really, and did basically nothing.  i wonder about how the freshman for this year.  if any of them are like me.  they seem so young, some of them fourteen or thirteen.  i wonder how different i am now than what i was.  i used to stumble out my words, which is why i didnt talk a lot, because of feeling helpless and having nothing to say, which i am assuming is normal.  i was terrified of upperclassmen and had some strange tendancies.  you wonder how you get to being where you are in life.  ""how did i get here?""  (the talking heads) sometimes is the theme song of my life.

its good to be a senior.  its good to be almost done.  who ever said high school are the best days of your life was completely wrong.  they are good days, and i dont mind school, but i dearly hope these are not the best days of my life.  i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come."

hung out the 22nd and 23rd. went sledding and some other stuff, i cannot remember that far back.

i cleaned the 24th and 25th.

26th-31st i was in calumet michigan
i played pool, sheepshead, watched most a dodgeball, talked about music, and read this book about bob dylan.  i also skied and sat in the sauna and went out to eat a lot.  i sort of feel like i dont have to eat for a couple days.  the people i hung with: jojo, aaron b, mitch and daniel from the team.  ryan from las angeles or something, dane from chicago, allie and mara from milwaukee.  there were a lot more fun people than i expected, so it turned out to be not just five days of complete nothingness and mind numbing boringness!  

came home and went to allisons b-day party/ new years party.  good times!  i came home way tooo late and i am really glad i dont have any homework for the break.  well, none that counts anyways.

went to best buy to use the $5 gift card, and bought nino rojo.  i went with daniel and we were music snob hooligans. bob dylan and yanni are next to each other on the wall there. hah.  

then we went to office space max.  and looked for a good notebook, but even with all that damn paper, they didnt have one.  not one good one.  so we sat in ""big boss"" chairs and held our cigars at length, watching them carefully that they did not explode.  we fired and rehired for twice the salary, sold company shares, asked for more coffee and generally acted like big head honcho big cheese hooligans.

after that, we drove to michaels, but daniel wanted to go to shoe carnival and we spoke in heavy russian and french accents.  we were listening to nino rojo so that helped too.
daniel (regular voice): ""i am going to look for spraypaint""
Me (heavy french accent): ""don' get lost!  i will not come fine you!""
daniel (regular voice): okay.
i found my notebook, and i bought daniel some spray paint.  that is another thing you can only do at 18, buy spraypaint.  the color was basil. please remind yourself that we are standing in line at the michaels checkout, neither of us does drugs, and neither of us would ever consider huffing anything:

daniel (stoned voice): ""lets go home and huff this stuff"" 
Me (stoned voice): ""yeahhhhhhh, i bet it smells like basil""
stoned pause
daniel (stoned voice): ""did you already try it?""

then we sang in low mournful spanish voices all the way home about yo como el arbol de navidad!  then we came home and rapped about eating sandwiches."

calc is so worriesome right now, i cant think of much else.  i am so afraid i will blank or forget small things like +C's and how to integrate stupid easy stuff.  its pretty much all consuming, it makes me want to sleep all the way from now until past the test so i wont have to take it.  It sounds so dumb, like "" get over it, just take the damn test and dont worry""... but it doesnt work that way.  for another class i might say ""fuck it"" but this class i cant.  its important because it is a challenge.  this is the class i have worked the hardest in my whole life.  i never work hard, and when i do, i want to see results and the result makes a bigger difference to me.  i will be crushed if i do a bad job on this exam.  

school is never condusive to lack of worry.  school aggrivates everything bad.  it makes anti-socialness worse, studying worse, concentration worse, its uncomfortable, cold, sweaty and artificially lit.  artificial light will kill you.  humans need real light to survive, and improve morale.

so, how about that for cup half empty? i say we need a smaller cup.

okay: list some good things, to make you feel better.
i like 9:00 as an AM time (and a PM time)
i am a better skier this year
i sometimes accomplish things
i love unexpected phone calls or emails
i love music
smiling makes your day better
laughing doubles its value.
sleeping in has its perks, and no one can fault you for it
i love the sun, and the snow, and that we have windows in our kitchen so we can see the sun and the snow together
i can cook
i have wonderful friends, who are really awesome people.  everytime i meet someone i dont like, who is shallow, who has no sense of morals, i think of my friends, and i say to myself, what wonderful people i am surrounded by, and am grateful to have them in my life.  people who help me to see that things are never as bad as they seem, and who show me the good things i might have missed if i had been hanging my head at the uselessness of the world.  the people who talk to me when i think i want to be alone, and prove to me i really dont want to be.  please know you are loved, i think we forget all too quickly.  i know i do."

"event","last night in the snow allison, sabrina and I sledded on saucers.  we had races, and went down on our backs and bums and tummys.  we sat on each other, and made sled trains.  most of all though, sabrina and i are xxxcorexxx, because we can stand on our saucers like they are snoboards and slide down the hill.  the velocity you attain is amazing, and its scary!  if you fall you bruise and hurt yourself.  Sabrina, she knocked the wind out of herself, it was a sweet crash!  
and then these fellows from arkensas came.  Bishop and Roger and Matt and someone else.  
""this is colder than my freeezer!""
""one flake of snow falls in arkensas and everything is closed""
were the ways the fellow described how cold it was here.  he was completely bundled up, like a giant fluffy puffy pillow, almost as round as he was tall from all the layers and his giant coat.  apparently the one person from green bay was teaching the arkensonians how to ski because they were going to ski brule the next day.  
then we went home and drank tea and cocoa and went to sleep.
sabrina and i had yumme fat panks this morning wiht rasperry sauce.  i am still so full from them.  those chubbers. :)"

history is my least favorite subject, mainly because i dont bother to learn dates.  i would rather hear what happened, and determine its impact on the further course of history than to know what date exactly it happened on.  if you like dates, fine, i will buy you a calendar and you can record everything that happened in the world on any given day.

"event","so i made a myspace... finally, i guess.  i sort of feel like i am selling out and not sticking it to the man like i should be.  

sticking it to the man is my number one job in this life, and it controls a lot of my life.  it makes me feel guilty about driving, about living in a warm house, about wearing clothing made in third world countries, about buying anything new, about wanting new shoes, about using hair gel, about going to dances, about extravagance, and about wastefulness. i could go on, but i think you catch my drift.  shopping is tedious with these stringent regulations, and i wish i could just say i didnt care.  i love fashion and style, but i fear wearing leather because it makes me feel like a bad person.  wearing any sort of animal fiber makes me feel like a bad person, and guilty and like i should be shot.  i dont understand how people can just not care about where their leather comes from, or where their angora rabbit hair sweaters come from. i dont understand and cannot sympathize with the attitude of ""animals were made for us to use"".  its not true.  i feel like money is corrupt and our world is corrupt and there is no way to change it.  it makes me want to reject society as a whole and live on my own in the woods and eat only fish i catch and berries i find.  and i dont even know what i would wear, old race tee shirts i suppose.  electronics also scare me, and the computer scares me and television freaks me out too.  i think i am probably nuts."

"event","I walked into Erbert and Gerbert subs, not intending to buy anything.  Friends of mine wanted dinner, and I decided to join the journey to find some. i read the Sign that named and described the subs, and i saw one, the Jacob Bluefinger, that had AVOCADO on it.  My eyes alit with the prospect of a good avocado sandwich.  while not particularly hungry, i hadnt eaten since lunch, it was dinner time.  I desired the sandwich.  except, i am a stingy little money pincher.  i dont spend any money on unneccesary things, like food or clothing.  i knew that i could go home and make myself dinner, and if i waited till the morning and skipped dinner i wouldnt die either.  Like i said, i dont spend money.  Its really really hard for me.  the draw of the avocado grasped me by my squiggling id, and my superego fought with a gnarly tooth to subdue it.
so i said to the cashier boy, ""i will pay 3/4 of the price of that sub""  the sub costed four dollars.  he looked at me like i was nuts.  i said, ""it was my birthday a few days ago."" and he started to kid me that if i wanted $1 off, i would have to give him a lot of information, and he was going to steal my identity.  it made me a little nervous.  he gave me half off the sub and it was delicious.  yummm.  $2 subs.

other than that, i have been dabbling with the violin some more, and it isnt too horrible sounding.  i am going to play the violin part to Iris, by the goo goo dolls, while ruthann plays one guitar, dylan plays the other and amber plays drums.  this consists of me transposing all of the notes from the third violin part because its in octives that violins cannot play in (or i cannot play a violin in)  to octives i can play in, and then learning to read rhythms and how to count with the switching times.  all you crazy music people out there probably think this sounds really easy.  hah, two days ago i didnt even know the scales... let alone any of this other stuff.  i learn by hearing.  i hope it ends up sounding cool and we can put it together."

in other news, my grandfather is here for the holidays, my family plans to celebrate a traditional pilgrim thanksgiving, sans the buckles and caps, because we are all new englanders at heart and in lineage.  we like sweet potato and succotash and we left england because the king was being nasty.  my ancestors came over on the mayflower, no joke, and another one of them was tried as a witch later in the witch trials.  Apparantly, according to my mother, i come from a long line of eccentrics.  as if you couldnt tell.

i enjoyed seeing the turkeys today, and dissapointed i was too under the weather to be really peppy about it.  Ashley and Rachel can attest to the fact that i zonked out during study hall.  i actually woke myself up because i was twitching and jerking.  everyone looked beautiful (in an outlandish sort of way), and if anyone wants to give me copies of pictures, i will surely take them.  my personal favorites:

simon dick- slutty schoolgirl
kari bacher- light ninja fighter
max renner- dark ninja fighter
ruthann masse- she looked like the 70's with velvet pants
Amber Wallace- beautiful in her green velvet dress
ben villewock's prince and princess who carried him around (pwkbs and justin w.)
Tara Cribb- Aldo Leopold Cheerleader
Rachel Caiti- 80's seductress? idk, it looked cool
Ashley- i could have done a much better job had i won her!
the boys in dresses freak me out a little bit...  hah
Matt fisher-m&m

and the boys in wrestling suits.  those freak me out a lot.  spandex is used en masse on turkey day.  probably the biggest day of the year for kids at east high in spandex, no joke.  good thing its only one day."

"event","Listening to Black Balloon surfaces so many old memories.  We used to travel to the southwest for two weeks of every August to visit my father's parents.  we'd spend a week with them, and a week driving around Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.  while we were there, we would drive throught the rural barren desert and you would always see small circles of decrepit campers with tumbleweed and dust and tires on the roof so it wouldnt blow off.  Much of the time we would drive through extremely poor southwestern indian reservations, with barbedwire fences that had posts which would stick out at every different angle like teeth that had come in wrong.  the people mostly sold the jewlery they had made at all the tourist attractions.  looking back, i was staring poverty in the face, and i didnt even know what poverty was.

one trip we went to a still existant zuni pueblo.  the people lived at the top of a mesa, and still in self made clay and stone houses like the old anasazi ruins i had been familiar with visiting.  i thought these people were just living like the anasazi because they wanted to, because that was their culture.  they had no running water, no radios, batteries, electricity or k-mart clothes.  i dont even remember what they wore.  we went with a bunch of other middle to upper class white people to look in their houses.  i dont even know what this was.  it makes me sick to think about it.  we looked in their houses, and i remember this one old and fat, dirty haired, wrinkle faced woman who lived in the sloppiest tinest hut with rocks sticking out everywhere.  she had rotten teeth.  Another woman was selling pottery, and a clean shaven, dockers wearing man wanted to buy a pot from her.  they can sell their beautiful, patterned pottery for 60 dollars or more.  he had only a $100 dollar bill, and he handed it to her for a 70 dollar pot.  she smiled and laughed a little, and said abashedly that she had never seen so much money in one place, and didnt have enough money in the house to change the bill.  we left, and my dad was really mad, i think he might have cried, or at least wanted to.  our whole car was silent, and i didnt know why.  i tried to ask and my  parents became agitated and upset.

i thought the zuni people lived this way because of tradition, and because they wanted to.  I didnt know it was because they couldnt afford anything else.  to this day, i cannot imagine living like that, especially as i sit here at my computer, in my fabrics with my easily accessable music.  i can drive wherever i want, and go to college and school and brush my teeth with running water.  i guess i write this in the spirit of thanksgiving."

"event","while making a really awesome mix cd last night eric asks me if i want to go to the play.  i tell him i dont, because i dont want to spend five dollars two nights in a row to see a play i saw the last night.  so i continue to paint and create the cover for my mix cd for ruthann.  he continues to complain about being bored.  he says ""i am bored""  and sometimes i ask him if he is still bored.  and he always replies yes.  if i ask him if he has found something to do yet, he replies no.  so i say, ""do you want to go do something?""  its a fairly vague sentance, and for good reason.  there is nothing to do in green bay if you are under the age of twenty one.  so we go to barnes and noble, after a jaunt about the town.  we go there and mingle amongst the books, talking and solving problems.  and then we go home.  

my mother tells me ruthann has called, and she was who i was waiting for!  so i call her back and then go over to her house, where ruthann allison and i watch footage of a night last winter when allison, ruthann and i hung out.  its funny know that allison will react the same to the same situations, regardless of the time that has passed between the reoccurance of the situation.  and we also decided that we are easily amused.  ruthann attemped to teach me to play some songs on the guitar, but then she found her violin and music, and i played violin for the first time in ages.  my fingers are too small and inflexible to play guitar.  and i dont want anyone musically inclined to hear me play (violin or guitar, or anything!).  because i suck really badly.  my intonation...ugh.

and today, i went for a run with my brother, and it felt a lot longer than it was.  but it was good to run, so enough said.  comedy city went alright tonight, caroline and i reffed.  basically, caroline reffed, but i assisted her, to keep things moving.  i felt strongly about the show, that gains were made, and laughs were had. 
 
i would extend an  invitation to everyone to attend a comedy city high school leauge show.  every week, from six to seven, highschoolers, yes, people your age, mount the stage and perform improv to the best of their abilities.  although these people are not professional, they are very talented, and the price is also free.  if you are interested in directions, talk to me, and i can tell you all about how to get there.  if you are interested in becoming an improv comedian, on saturdays come at four to the club, and you can attend practice.  

we made some movies, short shorts, as we like to call them, at nick's house. and had some good laughs on account of steve ludy, nick's father.  i cannot wait to see the movies in edited format.

tommorow is a trail cleanup and traveling to visit colleges.  i wont be around monday and tuesday, and i am excited for that."

"event","the watercolors and watercolor brushes in the art room scrape the pit of the lowest quality implements ever created.  its like berry juice and sticks with a few wisps of dead animal hair attached.  the color is weak and the brushes lose hairs into my paintings whenever i try to make a wash.  all my washes streaked instead of blended.  the colors dont mix and the artist is left with crayolaesque color in her peices.  i wasnt aware of the nature of the problem intially, i thought it might be me, regressing into having childlike absence of technique.  however, after using my own brushes and paint at home, i realize that the problem is not me, it is mrs. mocco's equipment.  
I told her this yesterday.

""mrs mocco, you know i dont like your brushes... but i think the paint is weak too.""  she looks at me puzzeled.  
""whats wrong with it?"" she asks dissapprovingly.  
"" its weak and doesnt mix well""
""how do you figure?""
i explain to her that i used my own paint and brushes at home and came out with piece that had nice subtleties of color and no streaking.  she demands to see the paints, and suggests that i bring them into the class room.  
""if i bring the paint and brushes here, i cant use them at home."" i protest. she ignores my problem, i dont think the lady listens well.
""you could bring them here and use them here"" she insists.
""i know i could, but then i couldnt use them at home.""
""the nice thing about watercolor is you can re-wet it,"" she explains knowingly. i am no dunce, and of this fact i was fully aware.  obviously you can re-wet watercolor. ""so just bring it here, and you can do your painting."" she continues.
""i dont think i will"" i say firmly.  she gives me a hard look, and walks away.
in an aside to sarah i say ""shes getting really saucy with me,"" and we both raise our eyebrows and smile wierdly.
""bring in the paints anyway, i want to inspect them.""  shes says, so she can compare my old paints that i like to the paints she bought for the classroom.  shes really competitive for an art teacher.

- adventure with mickhail to the dark woods, it was great!  i have to commend him for being so gung-ho on doing somewhat foolish things in the middle of the night.  most people would have said no, flat out.

-class the next morning, and lots of college application stuff.

-watched amityville horror, which I was scared of.  queer similarities between my family/house and that of the movie amityville horror: my father has a beard, i live in an old house with lots of woodwork, some one died in our house, my father chops wood a lot.  in the light of day, that sounds really dumb and amber, allison and sarah laugh at me, but at night, in the dark, to me who lives in the house, its scary!

-we tried to go to hotel hell, but no one was interested in getting out and looking in the hotel.  they were too afraid.  so then I tried to tell scary stories, but i am no good at that, so they laughed at me and amber told us about the giggling grandma serial killer.  we went and sat in the park and were circled by a wierd red car.  so we freaked out.

-when i entered my house that night, around 1:15, someone called,and hung up when i answered, which really scared me.

-shopping yesterday with ruthann and amber.  I found a nice purple long sleeve shirt.

-comedy city, ya'll... i played, and tried to do gibberish, and i feel like it went well.  then we played football in astor.  Sabrina is a very good quarterback, and the grass was really slippery, so sarah fell a lot.  Sean had a very good running game and jessica made up plays called the candycane.  Even though nick didnt pick me for his team,  he still started losing, but eventually won (when he picks me, its our jinx that our team will lose).  everytime jessica yelled ""hooker"", nick dropped the ball.  when she didnt yell it, he caught it.   then we had a fire at mi casa.  i fear i was a terrible host because i was quite tired from all that running around.  i dont trust neil with gasoline... and i dont care that he made a fire!  so we roasted so shmallows, and ate dog buiscits (scooby snack gram crackers) and heard some more stories of hotel hell. and one story of a scottish pirate that no one listened to.

i'll miss cc a lot, and the girls in it, but its time to move on to new things.  that chapter of my life is over, and i am happy about the way it ended.  its not like this whole sorrowful detachment thing, but i will miss seeing their happy faces every day after school, especially because i hate winter.

When John Cusak says that he ""always entered relationships with one foot out the door, looking for other prospects"" i understood that intensely."

"event","dont bother reading this, its just me talking to myself.

i havent spent a day where i dont set foot outside in a long time.  

sometimes people say they feel better when they keep to themselves for a day or so.  i usually feel worse when i dont leave the house.  i havent been this inactive in a long time.  like, all i did today was sit and read and watch bad news bears and do homework.  

all i think about when i am not doing something or otherwise occupying my mind, is running.  i think about running constantly.  i run the colburn course through my mind over and over.  i remind myself of the splits i want to hit.  its making me moody and morose and worried.  and being concerned about a race is one thing, but i am afraid now that worry will turn to tension and i will be too tense and not relaxed enough to run the sort of race i want to run.  and being nervous about being nervous just makes it worse.  i need a guarantee to put my mind to rest, and the only one who can give me that guarantee is myself.  

then other people complicate the business.  they ask you questions like ""why do you look so tired"" or ""how do you feel today"" and they wont understand if you try to tell them.  people hear but they dont listen.  they say, well, just do your best and it will be fine.  doing your best... not an easy thing to accomplish.  running a race is so delicate, you cant go out too fast... nor too slow... and the second mile is all grit.  and the last 800 is heart.  so i watched part of the four minute mile hoping to learn some of those techniques, but they really arent teachable.  you have them and employ them if you can, and if you dont have them, you dont.

i dont lack these things, but sometimes i am afraid to push myself to the next level, or push myself harder than its easy to go.  i have never hit my maximum, or my limit... i dont even know how far away it is.  all i really want is to get closer to the limit.  i dont even have to hit it, just to get closer.  my mom told me that everyone else knows i can run faster, and they dont understand why i am afraid to try.  she says i am the only one who doesnt believe i can run fast.  and the only one who can instill confidence in you is you.  if you dont believe in yourself, no one else will.

i will give myself propaganda, and make myself believe what i may or may not believe right now.  i have to believe i can hit my splits: 6:45, 7:15, 3:30, and that i can run with ilse.  because i can.  i cancancan can can cancancancan. grarrrr.  if i were a beast right now i would run up the side of the house and tear apart the roofing material.  i wish i had claws so i could tear something."

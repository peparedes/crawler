AND THEN they had this contest at kmart where all the customers had to like find me in the store advertising the clothing and if they did they got a giftcard. AND THEN they would make announcements like ""look for krista in low rise levi flares! with a pink skull b akcpack!!!"" AND THEN people would be like ""THERE SSHE IS!!!!!!!!""

nothing new has been going on really
schools over thats about it
working like everydayyyyy i wanna shoot miiiselff
except tonight at work was pretty chill. me lauren kayleigh and melissa were the only cashiers
work is so funny like i cant handle it. its prety much all i talk about too. yesteday there was a blackout and everyone freaked out and the registers all went CRAZY! i dont know everything is funny. whenever anyone buys something funny we always have to be like COME BAG FOR ME! so we can see waht the customer bought. like these mexicans with man thongs. and then today kayleigh put all the registers lights on blinking and was like ""its christmas!"" and the common conflicts mothers were all like ""hahhhh is this place hiring"" os good and nicholes like ""UM why are the lights blinking?!""  um hello? um hi. english is gonna be hard and i studied vocab with lauren for such al ong time. we even studied at work what nerds. had such good steak and potatos and her house before. thats pretty much all the excitement in my life.

at work today an 8 year old boy bought his mom a mothers day card, chocolate and then he donated $4 to the march of dimes (sick babies) and he paid for it all wit hhis own money.
it was so cute it made me so happy. cause noone ever donates theyre always like ""I ALREADY DO!"" and usually i dont even ask the little kids cause they dont know what i'm tlaking aobut but the little boy comes up and goes ""i would like to donate $4 please"" it was so cute aw.

i dont think anyone even reads this but i dont even care.
i cant sleep cause i had caffienated orange soda today.

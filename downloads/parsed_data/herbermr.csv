"event","So I've been sick for what seems like forever...even though it's only been about two weeks.  I just called the doc and they are going to see me today!  I was going to wait until next week, but it's the ears that are bugging me.  I don't know if I've ever been so congested that I actually can't hear!  The OTCs have quit working, too.  I've gone through three boxes of Kleenex!

This week has been a blast, as is obvious from my description of ilness.  I worked Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Spanaway, which really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  When I would get home, though, I'd drop like a rock.  Yesterday I subbed and I thought the cold was going away, but alas, last night and this morning have been pretty bad.  I just took a shower and that helped, I can actually breath right this moment.  Yay!  I am back to regular work tomorrow. 

I haven't even been chatting with anyone I've been so 'dead.'  So, other than work, it's been a boring week...  It sure would have been a great week if I wasn't sick!  I could have gotten so much done...oh well."

"event","Yuck, in general I feel crappy.  I got this cold...last week and it was totally in my throat and causing body aches.  I was encouraged when it seemed to go away...but then a resurgence of some other form of illness...this time all in my head (ears, nose, etc).  It also kills off my voice...I sound like some old geezer.  I got home from work today and eventually I sat down and ended up taking a nap.  When I woke up, I was freaking out (as usual, which is why I try not to take 'real' naps).  I hadn't taken any DayQuil so I was just feeling horrible and then my head was running a million miles an hour about Travis, money, job, etc.  I hate it when that happens.  Now I am feeling better since I took some DayQuil and I'm watching 7th Heaven and writing this, too.

So what's up with Travis?  He came over on Friday.  I'm so boring, though, so I'm not sure if he had a good time or not.  Today he wasn't much for conversation, but oh well. (He wants a new job...Quizno's isn't floating his boat anymore.)  I'm vowing not to worry about this whole thing and not let it get to me like it could, so I'm not!  We watched a movie and did lots of talking on Friday (in the morning...it was weird watching a movie!).  Nothing really out of the ordinary.  I wish I wouldn't have had to go to work since it would have been nice to be together longer.  We hugged :)  but I didn't dare kiss him since I had just gotten over a cold (and now I know another one was forming).  I'm hopeful he will want to do something on one of my days off this week (but, again, not fixated about this).  I never got to ask him before he headed off for work...maybe he'll be online later and I can see.  If not, I can sub (if I'm feeling better) or work on my sub application for Federal Way since Shonda's dying for me to get registered up there.    

I'm working at a different store for three days this week, which is both cool and weird.  Getting there at 7 a.m. is not a favorite thing to do, but it's nice to have nights off.  I'm just working in the store's backroom getting it all organized.  It's tiring stuff, though, especially with this cold. I don't have to dress up, which is nice.  It's lots of manual labor...I'm surprised that I was able to do so much to day with this cold! 

Since I've been sick, everything else has been sliding!  I forgot to pay a bill so I had to pay by phone, which costs extra, and boy, that sucks.  I need to go grocery shopping, but tonight I am just beat.  I haven't even fixed anything for dinner, but these colds have really been killing my appitite.  I missed church on Sunday so I am going to feel so 'in the dark.'  I'm sure I'll catch up some on Wednesday."

"event","It's funny...I completely, yes, completely forgot about this thing.  It's not like in the past where I have just not updated because it's hard to remember...I totally forgot.

So, I don't know where I left off...but I'm sure it was back in July...I guess I'll look when I'm done.  I'm working at Rite Aid mostly right now, and subbing on occasion.  Diane's in or on her way back from Las Vegas where she found Match Game machines (we are planning a trip down there for spring break :)).  So that's the boring stuff, not that most of my life isn't boring.

I'm finally not thinking about the Steven thing too much...that was a real mess, and it should have been, but he made it that way.  So far so good...and I don't want to talk about it too much or I'll jinx it or I'll start remembering things I don't want to think about!

I finally got up the courage to talk with Travis at Quiznos.  Yeah, I know, Diane told me I should have talked to him way back at the beginning of August.  Oh, well.  We are gonna hang out on Saturday (I don't like to get to hopeful on these things, but I just checked with him last night and it's still on).  He works until 4 and I work until 6.  I'm going to spend the rest of the time before work today getting the place cleaned up since it sounds like he'd like to come back here.  I'm not exactly sure what we'll be up to, maybe watching a movie or something.  

So that whole thing went down very odd...  Marissa, at the store, knows him from school sort of.  She claims they had some of the same friends.  Anyway, she was yakking one day about knowing his AIM name and so then I went over to Quiznos and I was telling Travis about her bragging.  I didn't know what his AIM name was at that time, so he whipped out a sharpie and wrote it down for me.  I was like, 'whoa.'  If that's not a sign...  So we chatted and I found out what he knew, he found out what I knew.  Cool.  

Also, through this whole thing, I found out that Marissa, Stormee, and Garrett all knew that I like guys!  Garrett already talked to me about it, but now I know about the other two.  The story Garrett told was pretty funny.  I'm glad I'm not hiding things too well (Travis said he picked up on it pretty quick).  

Well, that was a good story...What else is there to talk about?  Um...I'm still thinking about my endorsement thing.  I need to get Social Studies!  I really need to work on that.  I got a call this morning from White River asking me if I want to sub up there (I didn't answer it, she left a message).  The phone call woke me up, and then I couldn't get back to sleep, which made me mad.  Shonda's been begging me to register at Federal Way so that I can sub for her and her friends.  She also things there is a dude that's gonna bite it soon and that maybe they'll be looking for a long term sub.  I promised her I would work on that next week (it will cost me $50 for fingerprinting :().  It's not too big of a deal, I already have an application on file.  Also, in spite of everything, they are still requesting me out at FP.  Fun times.

Like I said earlier, today is get the place ready for company day.  I also have to put on new license plate (don't get me started).  Today is payday, so it's time to pay bills and rent, too.  I should get started on all this stuff!  I am so looking forward to tomorrow, but I'm not sure what to expect, so I hope it's not a let down.  At least I know Travis more than a name on the computer."

"event","So Sunday was a busy day for sure...here's a run down.

I went to chuch in the morning and then swung by to see my dad and pick up some wood for the fireplace.  I came home and rested a bit and then unloaded the wood (a trunk full).  At 6 I went to my pastor's home and we all talked about the big church event that is in Portland starting next weekend.  All 16 people were there!  It sounds like it will be a good time.  After that I went to the grocery store and here's where the fun begins...

I knew Steven was working at 10 p.m. and I hadn't been able to contact him via phone so I went by his work and luckily got a few minutes to chat with him.  I told him I'd give him a ride after work at 1 a.m.  So then I went home and relaxed a bit for a couple of hours.  I had a ton of E-mails to write and I got that done.  Yay.

At 1 a.m. I picked Steven up and we ended up coming back to my place.  We did a little bit of nothing for a while...we read some magazines I had lying around and he updated his website (he doesn't have web access at home).  We then watched some QaF and boy I was getting tired.  

Eventually I went to bed, but Steven was Mr. Hyper so he stayed up...I think he fell asleep around 9 a.m.!  I got to sleep about for about four hours and actually I'm surprised I feel as 'awake' as I do now.  I have to work at 9 a.m. tomorrow, though, so maybe that's when it will hit.

In all this chatting with Steven it became clear we of different minds on things.  He's also planning on moving.  I told him today that he can call any time, but, basically, I was not going to go out of my way to contact him.  He doesn't want a boyfriend and I guess I'd have to say I do. It was really weird talking to him about things, since he doesn't consider anything we've done even close to 'dating' or even 'going out.'  I wish I would have asked him exactly what he did consider all of this...probably 'hanging out.'  

He actually made it clear that he still wanted to do stuff (?) and that's just fine with me, but I feel so much better (and yet not) that I know more about what he's thinking.  Of course it will take a while to get over this...it always does for me.  I get so attached so quick it's really a let down when even something as mild as this happens.  I am so hungry right now...I haven't really had anything since the picnic last night.  Stress always goes straight to my stomach!  I am going to try and have some toast in a bit.

So things with Steven have become more clear.  I will probably still check in with him later this week in case he wants to 'hang out' since that's fine...and now that I know that's all he wants I can handle it.  I promised I'd call sometime during my trip just to say hi, as well.  

Like I said, he's moving anyway...so I guess it's good to get this all figured out now rather than later.  It doesn't matter though...I still miss him.  Fortunately, since I'm so tired, I should sleep no matter what tonight!

Oh, the main thing I was going to mention was Steven's thoughts about love...He got messed up in the last 'relationship' so that's one of the reasons he won't let himself fall in love (not that he was even close with me, but I was much closer to that with him).  I told him that that's just the way I am and I haven't figured out how to change that.  I guess I learn more every time I get the broken heart (which is more like broken stomach to me!).  I have definitely gotten better at this since the first time...but I still have a long way to go.

There is so much more to say...but I'm ready to not talk about it.  This was enough to clear my head (no matter how cloudy it is with only 4 hours of sleep in 40 hours)."

"event","Today was a day off!  Yay!  So I didn't do a whole lot, but I got a lot more done than I normally do on days off.  I started out by calling Steven, and I left a message.  I guess I will come back to this later since it's a whole different story.  I started working on laundry and I got the dishes done too.  I had a ton of papers to shred after the big search for chuch, so I did that (and took out three bags of garbage!).  I got two new frames at work yesterday (75% off) and fixed the broken frame and replaced one other one.  That took longer than I thought it would!  Later, I went by church and changed some posters related to the search and then went by my dad's.  We went to IHOP as usual.  We would have gone to Ivar's but the traffic was heavier than normal in that direction.  When we got back to his place we had this idea about taking some of the wood from the building of the apartments he's doing.  That way, I would have some would to burn this winter.  I loaded up the van with what was there (they had to be small pieces) and took them over to my apartment.  I had to move some things around in the storage closet, but I got it all set.  I will get some more on Sunday, maybe.  It will be cool to not have to worry about wood for the fireplace!  On my way back I stopped at Rite Aid and got some new towels (not why I stopped) that were really cheap and they are nice.  I spent over $60 for new towels and I found out they sucked...and I spent all of $12 on these ones or something and they are at least as good.  Makes me mad about those other ones, but they are so used now I could never take them back.  Since then I've been on the computer or watching TV.  I had to do some folding too...I played match game interative and I got my name on the TV!  It was pretty cool.  I've chatted with Diane (broken computer), Lucho (moving), and Allen (had a date with another guy).  Earlier I talked with Chris (has attachement disorder for Allen) and Lindsey (likes a guy but he lives too far away and she doesn't have a car to use).  

Now I am watching Jimmy Kimmel and the new towels are tumbling in the dryer...fans are on too.  I also taped an hour of loveline tonight so I will have a complete set for the trips coming soon!  The chatty with Diane proved she is ready to get out of NO.  I am ready to rest on the train, but that's the last part of the trip!  First, our new pastor visits...then it's off to Portland, and then I fly from Portland to Houston and then to New Orleans (NO).  After hanging out there for a few days, Diane and I will hop the train to Chi-town where we'll switch to another train from there to Seattle.  Sheesh, when I get back from that it's back to work!  Oh, I almost forgot, I called White River today about a job, and again, there was no answer!  This time i left a message.  I hope this one works out, I haven't seen anything else coming through that i'd even be able to do.   I need to get on the stick and do some of the stuff I keep forgetting about...like updating my placement file at PLU and doing more research on add on endorsement (social studies). 

So now back to Steven.  He was in Idaho last week (we hung out before he left) and he called me on Sunday night.  After I wrapped at work (10:30) he came over and we watched a ton of Queer as Folk.  He'd never seen it and now I think he's addicted.  Maybe not, but he really likes Everwood, so it isn't totally out of line.  He stayed the night.  Actually, he stayed the day since we went to bed so late.  I didn't have to work until 2, so that was no big deal...the next day (Tuesday) though, I had to work at 7 a.m. and i didn't know if I was going to make it (I was soooooooooo tired), but I did.  Anyway, back to Steven.  He was supposed to call me 'sometime'--which I thought meant some time Tuesday--and let me know what his schedule is for the rest of the week (I told him I had Tuesday night off, all of Wednesday and Thursday).  As of now (12:23 a.m. on Thursday!), he hasn't called, and yet I called him once last night and then once early today.  The main thing is that he comitted to going to a movie on Friday, but I don't know what time he has to work or anything so we still need to figure that out.  I work until 5:30 so I figured I would pick him up or something, but I need to know before then!  I am such a planner...I just can't handle not knowing what's going on.  

Tomorrow i hope to get more done on the big 'to do' list I built this morning.  I might even call Shonda and see if she wants to do dinner or something(unless Steven comes around).  I really need to vacuum, and now that laundry is done that should be possible.  I need to hit the grocery store one of these days soon...and do some cleaning in the bathroom (the floor is getting gross!).  I hope Steven calls tomorrow...I just can't handle this suspense (I am such a lightweight).  I will probably call tomorrow night--one more time--since it will be the 'last chance' for Friday.  I'm also worried because I will be working like crazy next week and then gone for nearly two, so there will not be much down time, if Steven's even interested any more (who knows!  I speculate in my head so much!).  

I think I'll finish my cherry 7*up and go to bed...after I do a little more folding..."

"event","OK...today was a good day...yay!  I had today off, and tomorrow, too.  I went to church and did a lot of stuff and then I got a phone call and had a 'date' this afternoon.  That is much better than when Lucho was over since he is not interested in anything in particular.  We went by the hospital so he could see his mom for a few minutes.  After that, we just went for a drive and talked.  He is too busy to get out much so we drove past where he used to live so he could 'relive the memories.'  We grabbed some fast food...and came back to my place and  watched a movie.  We were going to see a real movie, but since we were so indecisive we ran out of time...thus having to resort to the (cheaper, at least) home+vcr combo.  I took him back home after the movie so he could head off to work.  I came home and slacked off...and now I am writing in my journal which is just like slacking off :)  

I had today off...which is really odd...but tomorrow is a big deal at church since we will be doing phone interviews of perspective new pastors.  We will be doing that at 6, but I have to get ready for that by organizing all my stuff.  I am out of milk so I need to get some of that...and then there is also my never ending list of things to do around the apartment and/or car.  

It's time to finish planning the big trip to NO and so on.  It sounds liek we're coming back via Chicago again...which is more boring, but probably less expensive and less time involved.

So what else is there to talk about?  It's nice to not have school any more...I get a little time to do nothing!  I got a call about a job ain the White River District but it sounds like the principal will be on vacation next week (maybe 2?) so I will have to wait until he gets back to see what is up...  I need to do more looking tomorrow for sure... I keep forgetting.  Maybe Shonda and I can work out an interview plan like we talked about a while back.  That would be a big deal.  I should call her early tomorrow and see what she's up to either in the afternoon or maybe Tuesday morning since I'm working at 3 that day.

OK, over and out."

"event","You can look at the last entry to see what I had on my mind all day...but here's what I really have been up to.

School ended last week so there is no more subbing.  I am doing Rite Aid all the time now.  I had today and yesterday off.  Yesterday I worked around the house a lot...it's really starting to shape up.  I have the closet virtually organized in the bedroom and I got vacuuming, dishes, laundry, cleaned the kitchen, put up a picture that fell down, cleaned the windows in the car...many other things done.  

I went to dinner with dad last night, that was cool.  IHOP, as usual.  

Today I went and picked up a sign for church and I'm not very happy with it.  We'll see if other folks like it or not.  If not, I'll take it back.  It's the font that's messed up.  So then after picking that up I went to church and did about a million things.  I had to go to the postal connections store and mail some stuff too.  I got lunch at Taco Del Mar and that was tasty.  I got home and I sort of chilled a bit...I even fell asleep for a few minutes.  Later, I decided to go groceries and that cost me $80.  Everyone was grocery shopping tonight.  I got back here and unloaded the groceries and then the fridge was like dead!  It finally turned on, but it was very warm in there.  I'm not sure what the deal was.  It's running now.  I started watching a movie I will have to finish tomorrow night since I think I will be going to bed soon.  

At 11 I decided I better get some E-mails out... I had nearly 20 to deal with in my inbox.  I think I'm down to 10 now, and they are not important ones.

Tomorrow it's Rite Aid early and then a church meeting.  Maybe I will address the problem in the previous entry after that...we'll see.  Friday it's workday at church in the morning...then Rite Aid.  Saturday...I'm not sure what in the morning and then Rite Aid.

Oh, did I mention that Lucho left stuff here when he came through last time (and stayed the night?).  So I go look at my phone on Tuesday afternoon and it said I had a missed call.  It was from him, but he didn't leave a message.  Apparently he was heading back to Ellensburg but didn't want to leave a message (?) to let me know (so he could get his stuff!).  Maybe I should throw his pillow and shirt away, just to spite him.  You know I won't though, I'm way too nice."

"event","Tonight I went to a graduation party for the student teacher that was out at Franklin Pierce.  It was kind of cool, but also pretty weird since I didn't know anyone except her!  I stayed around for an hour and a half and they had a bonfire so that was fun.  I guess it's fun to make a new friend :)  We talked about FP a lot, but she really wants to work in a middle school.  So that was tonight...earlier I worked at Rite Aid and that's always a blast (yeah, right) but I am off for two days so I don't care.

Lucho stayed over Wednesday night and that was pretty cool to have a guest in my new place...the second one!  Diane was here a few weeks back.  We pretty much went to bed right when he got here (around 11:15 p.m. after I worked at Rite Aid) and then we hung out on Thursday ... we played Kart on Gamecube, went to the mall and Baskin Robbins.  Now he's home in Port Townsend for the weekend.  He needs to come back through here though...he left his pillow and a t-shirt!  

Tomorrow is a busy church day.  First, I have a meeting at 8 a.m. then the actual service at 10:30, then the whole church has a meeting.  After we're done with all that, then we head off for the church picnic, which should be fun, if it is good weather (they are saying it will be, which probably means it won't be!).  I'm not sure what I'm up to after that, but I made a new to do list on Friday and I can get started on that.  There is still plenty to do around the new place.  I did get another lamp set up in the bedroom last night...that was cool.  

I don't know if I'm subbing this week!  I will go in for sure on Friday since they are having a pot luck and I want to say goodbye to a teacher that is retiring!  I so want a job out there it isn't even funny, but I probably wouldn't be hired even if there was a job.  I have days at Rite Aid, though, so that will keep me busy.  Who knows, maybe I can even work an extra day out there (yeah, like I'd want to).  Thursday is my 10th anniversary (send gifts directly to my house).  10 freaking years.  Who would have guessed."

"event","I finally got some sleep!  I have been behind for so long.  I guess I will start with that and backtrack.  Last night I went to bed around 12:30, which is pretty normal.  I didn't know if I'd be subbing today, but, as it turned out I didn't.  I could have, but none of the jobs were worth getting up for :)  So I slept until 5 a.m. and then there were calls from the sub line.  It called until around 7 so I didn't get much sleep for those two hours.  I fell back asleep.  When I work up, I figured it was almost 9 a.m.  Little did I know it was nearly 11 a.m.!  Amazing.  I must have really needed some sleep.  I haven't been doing anything this morning...just sitting around.  I am off to Rite Aid in a bit and I will run some errands on the way.  Diane wants me to go to 'burg tomorrow but I don't think I will, I think I will finish unpacking the house.  I will shoot to visit 'burg next week.

     OK,  now the backtracking.  I don't even remember when I wrote in the journal last, but I will take it from moving.  Everything went fine with that, but I have been going non-stop since then.  Any days I have had 'off' I have been unpacking.  I am down to only a few things left to truly unpack (bedroom and pictures, mostly).  Since moving I have been subbing all the time, basically, and working at Rite Aid 26 hours a week.  On top of that there is a lot of stuff going on at church that I am very involved with (we are looking for a new pastor, and that is more challenging than it sounds).  There is also full time job hunting going on.  I turned in an appliction for two different open positions in the Federal Way district.  Shonda is dying for me to get on there.  One of the jobs is at her school.  We'll see.  I should have applied for a job open in Sumner and one in Auburn, but I just haven't had time.  I need to buckle down and keep my eyes peeled now that I think things are starting to slow down.  Oh, and there is also the fact that the French/English teacher at FP interviewed for a position in Bellevue on Monday and I'd love to take her place if she leaves.  I really do hope she gets a job for various reasons.  That would be my dream job for sure.

     I've also been talking with a few guys...as if I've had time for that.  One has seemingly vanished off the face of the earth, but he doesn't have 'net access so it's tough for him to keep up.  I hope he's online soon and maybe things will work out.  If not, oh well (yeah, right, as if I ever give up that easily).  The other guy is older so I'm not sure he's my cup of tea, but I will write him some mail today or tomorrow.  There are others too...my how popular I have become...and no time to be popular with!  
I'm still thinking about the big trip to NO to get Diane moved back.  I have done some research on $$ and it is a pretty penny, to say the least, but I almost think it's worth it because if I don't use this as a vacation I probably  won't do anything 'vacation-y' and that would be bad.  I need a break...and more than just not working.  I need to see how the money works out at the end of the month and see if my dad needs some dough back that I borrowed.  With all this subbing I ought to be able to get ahead...you'd think.

      So what else to talk about?  I got my full deposit back on my last apartment and I will use that toward the deposit for Dingo at this apartment.  She is adjusting quite nicely.  She doesn't really like going outside, which is fine, but sometimes she does get on my nerves she is inside so much!  I still really like it here, but the person above me just moved out and I hope I don't get a noisy person upstairs now.  It is just night and day compared to the old place.  I got my deposit check--like I said--and they just threw it in an envelope and sent it...no note...and they didn't even write the address right on it!  The post office corrected it and it finally got to me...7 days after they sent it.  AT least I did get it.  I am so glad to be moved from there.
      
     I'd say things are looking up.  I've been a wreck (it seems like) for the past few weeks because it just didn't seem like I was going to be able to keep up.  I did, and now I am finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.  Things are still a little tenuous at Rite Aid since the other shift supervisor quit/got fired.  She got hired over at Safeway, so I am happy about that.  I talked with the manager yesterday about her vacation check and he is going to check on it today.  They are such slackers when they owe pay.  I should call her today and give her an update.  I hope they find a new SS soon for us...it's very stressful out there when there are only three members of management and I'm only part time!  

     So I better get to it...E-mail writing, picking things up, and heading off to work.  It sure has been a restful morning.  Yay!"

"event","You'd think I could keep up with this thing...I should have written you something more substancial over the past, say, month. But, alas, I have not. Well, my weekend was acceptable, I guess.  I don't really remember very far back.  I worked at Rite Aid on Saturday and then I didn't hardly sleep at all that night.  Sunday I usually go to church in the morning, but because I didn't sleep I slept then, sort of.  After that I finally got my new apartment unpacked after two weeks of sitting in boxes.  It's actually starting to shape up.  I ran some errands, also.  So is that exciting?  For me it is :)

I should be preparing applications for full time teaching, but I never seem to have time!  

I went to Seattle a few weeks ago (did I write about this already?) for a friends birthday and we went to Gameworks and then to R Place.  I guess you could consider that my once a year trip to a club.  Not really my cup of tea.  

That's about as much as I can fit in right now..."

Jack--

A couple of things before I get to the phone call.  I am very upset about not having profiles!  Last time we talked, we had talked about 'unfilterd' profiles, and that's not really what we need, I was willing to go with it.  Then to hear we weren't going to get any profiles really upset me.  We plan out out meeting way in advance because everyone on our team is very busy with numerous other tasks, jobs, and families.  We CANNOT put off meetings and to think that our regional support is not there almost offends me.  I sent you the profile from our church over three weeks ago.  In my mind there is no reason that we shouldn't have had at least a half a dozen profiles upon my first request and another half a dozen for tomorrow 4/21.  We need to have our next pastor in place by the end of August!  We have very little time!  By not having the profiles before tomorrow's meeting so I can edit, copy, and distribute, it is setting us further and further behind.  I'll be honest with you, I don't really care what events are going on at the regional level, I expect everyone at the regional level to be working with the local churches all the time, including Sumner FCC.  If there are events precluding that participation, then there needs to be a reevaluation of the necessity of the events and/or your involvement in them.  We have had rumblings within the church of perhaps moving away from DoC and becoming independent.  The main reason for this rumblingspecifically has to do with lack of support from the regional level to the local church.  I, personally, am against moving away from DoC, but unfortunately this whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. 

So that said, I still am not sure what, if anything, we will be getting for our 4/21 meeting.  The two profiles I have are not even worth sharing with the team, but I understand that they must be sent becuase the applicants requested that.  I would have appreciated it if you would have looked at them ahead of time to give me a heads up on them.  In looking over them I pretty much ruled them out, but some added information from you could have changed my mind.

Please let me know if/when I will be receiving profiles.  I may be working tomorrow in the morning and afternoon, so you may have to leave a message if you call.  My phone number is 253-229-xxxx.  We are meeting at 7 p.m. so, if possible, get the profiles to me by then.

Please accept my apologies for not writing sooner, but I have plenty of other things on my plate to deal with, also.

Regards,

Mike Herbert"

"event","So here is what I wrote to Diane, about last night, only re-edited.  


[11:59] herbermr: so ... I left here, got there, parked (It cost me $7!) and we hung out at game works.  It was really fun.  Paid $20 for three hours of play, but we were only there for like 2 1/2 hours
[12:00] herbermr: I can't believe how spendy the games are if you don't get the unlimited play.  Never go to gameworks on a weekend.
[12:00] herbermr: That was lots of fun.
[12:00] herbermr: then it was off to JitB and I got a breakfast Jack and a lemonade
[12:01] herbermr: Went to R place and got my yearly fill of secondhand smoke
[12:02] herbermr: so we watched the porn Kareoke and the wet undie competition, which was the most interesting thing there
[12:08] herbermr: hahaha there were only four contestants!
[12:08] herbermr: and three were pretty good
[12:09] herbermr: they did dance
[12:09] herbermr: and I am judging on physical appearance too
[12:10] herbermr: there was one really hot one, but I couldn't actually see his undies
[12:10] herbermr: he was shorter than the others and the camera was not at the right angle
[12:10] herbermr: I was watching it on closed circuit
D:  So how many people went?
[12:11] herbermr: four
[12:11] herbermr: including me
[12:11] herbermr: which is the only reason I agreed to go
[12:11] herbermr: any more than that is too many
[12:02] herbermr: then I watched people dance to horrible rap music and we left
[12:02] herbermr: yes, they show porn and someone fills in the sounds
[12:02] herbermr: hehehe it was cool :)
[12:03] herbermr: I couldn't actually hear the kareoke
[12:03] herbermr: but I was picturing the sounds in my head
[12:03] herbermr: hahaha well, I wasn't in the front row
[12:04] herbermr: yeah, well, I guess it's the thought that counts
[12:04] herbermr: it was pretty funny
[12:04] herbermr: so then we left around 1:15 or so
[12:04] herbermr: which was none too early
[12:04] herbermr: I hate the smoke, the booze, the tight quarters, the music
[12:05] herbermr: what does that leave?
[12:05] herbermr: my ears were ringing when we left
[12:05] herbermr: they are better now...I think
[12:05] herbermr: there were drunk people and there was plenty of booze
[12:06] herbermr: of the four I listed, I guess I care least about that
[12:06] herbermr: It's just scary to know thatmany of those people go there every night and do the same thing
[12:06] herbermr: I went back to the car and the parking attendant was asleep ;)
[12:06] herbermr: well, now it's 1:30
[12:07] herbermr: but i found an automated machine that was working
[12:07] herbermr: and I paid
[12:07] herbermr: went to the car
[12:07] herbermr: drove home
D:  no cake?
[12:07] herbermr: got home at 2 something
[12:07] herbermr: no cake
[12:07] herbermr: he had cake w/his family
[12:07] herbermr: we didn't really go anywhere where there would be cake
[12:08] herbermr: then I turned off the computer
[12:08] herbermr: got ready for bed
[12:08] herbermr: and watched some TV before drifting off
[12:08] herbermr: I was sort of 'awake' when I got home
[12:08] herbermr: I didn't know if I was going to be able to sleep
[12:08] herbermr: so I think I heard my watch click 3
[12:09] herbermr: and I got up at 10:00 or something 
[12:09] herbermr: I ate breakfast and took a shower
[12:09] herbermr: yes, I was just ready to roll, i guess
[12:14] herbermr: so that was the night (and this morning)"

"event","Diane told me that I need to write since I have such an unboring journal.  I guess that's good!  Today was a lazy day.  I did pay bills and I got the cable TV taken care of for the move.  Then tonight was a meeting at church so I got things ready for that.  The big news was what happened yesterday and it spilled over into today.  At church I am the leader of a group hunting for a new pastor.  Our current pastor is retiring.  I got a call yesterday from him and he told me all about this mess concerning profiles (resumes) from potential candidates to fill the position.  I had talked to the regional minister by E-mail (the one who is supposed to distribute the profiles) and he was going to have his staff send all that he had (ones he hadn't looked at) down for our team to look at on Thursday.  I said fine, assuming there would be maybe 20 of them.  Apparently he passed that task off to someone else in the office and she told him that just wasn't doable.  So then the plan was for her to limit it down, which is totally not her job.  She got upset and so someone else 'volunteered' to look at the profiles and limit it down to send.  She's apparently not supposed to do that, but she took it upon herself.  It's very political, so the current pastor called me and told me all about it last night.  He's sort of been working behind the scenes so that we have something to look at on Thursday.  Whew.  I got an E-mail from our regional minister (oh, I forgot to say that he is in Indiana for some reason, not in Seattle) that he wasn't going to have any ready for Thursday.  Ok, so this is a big deal. I know...you are asking 'why?'.  It's a big deal because it's been over three weeks since we sent in our profile and all they really need to do is start matching them up!  Tottally his job.  He knew at that time that our meeting was this Thursday.  he also knows that we are on a tight schedule and that we need to have someone by the end of August.  That means there is no time to waste.

There is my long story.  Fun, wasn't it?  So now I am just hoping that we get something to look at on Thursday otherwise I will be a very unhappy camper.  I should probably write the regional minister back, and maybe call him tomorrow, but I am afraid I will go ballistic.  Hahaha.  

Speaking of tomorrow, I'm not sure what I'm doing.  I haven't even gotten a sub call.  I could start packing things up.  I really need to do laundry.  No meetings tomorrow either!  What am I to do!  Right now I think I will watch the Everwood I didn't watch last night and then maybe a QaF.  I should pop some popcorn.  Ug, I am so ready to move.  Double ug."

"event","Just got home from work...yay.  I am all 'set' to move now (not that I am prepared, but I have my new address, at least!).  I guess I should talk about what happened today (no matter how uninteresting) first, though.  I had a meeting at church this morning and that went fine.  I am so ready to be done with a few things at church and this is one of them...it just keeps drrrrrrrrrrrrraging.  I finally did the dishes after that.  I was completely out of everything.  Everyone knows it's not like me to do that, either.  I have just been so busy and/or so tired every day.  I headed off to work around 1:30 and it was pretty busy today!  We did get a lot of stuff done around the store even though April, our cosmetics person couldn't work due to her daughter being in the hospital.  I hope she's back tomorrow of we are not going to be in good shape.  We got the ad pulled and I even got some cycle counting done (as if anyone that doesn't work at Rite Aid has any idea what I am talking about).  Now I am home and typing away at the keyboard.  I haven't even changed my clothes yet.

So it's back to chuch tomorrow morning...and guess what?  Back to work tomorrow afternoon!  Monday I am not scheduled to sub, but who knows...and off to Rite Aid at 4ish.  I can start packing up things after that I think.  I am off Tuesday through Thursday from Rite Aid, so we'll just have to see if I end up subbing.  If not, I could really get a lot done.  

Is that all that's up?  I'm not sure...I hope so!  There are always jobs to apply for, too.  I applied for two on Friday.  One I know I am not qualified for and the other I am, but no one likes me so I probably won't get hired.  I really want to be at FP, but for that to happen another teacher would have to quit, and that just doesn't seem likely.  Then I might actually have a chance.  Just keep hoping!!!"

"event","After I watched QaF and ate dinner I went back to chatting and paying bills and cleaning off the top of the desk.  I got a call for subbing in May and then I went through and put important dates on the calendar (including that subbing date).  I wrote more E-mails (mostly about church stuff) and talked to Diane and Allen.  I am watching (listening) to Family Feud and they have these really stupid people on there, but those are the best ones.  It's sort of like on Match Game when the contestant gives a really dumb answer...sometimes it's very funny.  So maybe that makes the first part of my last entry more complete.  I hope so!"

"event","Wow, I didn't do a whole lot today but I didn't just sit around, either.  I got the car completely clean after church...which was quite a task.  I had really let it go too long.  I vacuumed it, cleaned the windows, cleaned anything that wasn't fabric, then armour-alled anything that wasn't fabric.  I got all the garbage taken out also.  I got all the car CDs organized and they are ready to return to the car.  

After all the car stuff (over an hour!), I came in and played SimCity on the comupter.  Then I chatted a bit and eventually ate pork and beans and watched QaF.  I chatted with Diane, of course, who is working on a million projects down at school. She didn't work on them much today, it sounds like, but she is still busy with them!  I chatted with Allen, who works at a Rite Aid in Redmond.  He called in sick today and was all worried about it.  He made me sort of mad (not like screaming) because he went out last night even though he was feeling sick and was tired...he was supposed to work at 10 this morning and yet stayed out until 2.  I told him that he shouldn't have done that...he might have felt fine this morning if he would have chilled out last night.  So we chatted quite a bit.  I think he's pretty nice, but obviously not the sharpest knife in the drawer.  I talked to another guy that lives in Seattle and is anxious to meet me.  He wants to do 'coffee' sometime.  We'll see...he sounds very nice but he is older and is a business man, sort of.  I think he is in his lower 30s.  

I can't wait to move...have I mentioned that?  I would go into details about the challenges of where I am, but instead I will look forward to leaving here at the end of the month.  The new place is very nice compared to here, but it is in a pretty big complex.  I have never been one for big complexes.  It has a washer/dryer in the unit, fireplace, lots of closets.  It has a deck or patio (depending on if I choose an upstairs or downstairs) and will let Dingo live there too.  It is larger than the place I have now and is newer (yay!).  Like I care, but it also has a pool.  I will be dropping off the application tomorrow and I hope to hear back from them Tuesday or Wednesday.

I am back to Rite Aid tomorrow (yippie).  I am not scheduled to sub tomorrow, but you never know what will happen between now and then.  I am scheduled on Wednesday and I am off from Rite Aid on Tuesday and Thursday so maybe I will pick a couple days up then.  I'm not sure what to do about White River...I need to get my namebadge back before i can sub there.  I have still been too busy out at FP anyway, though.  I need to apply for a couple of jobs...I guess I will hit those up on Tuesday.  There is a position at Washington High School called 'language arts' but it says that an English endorsement is OK.  At FP they are hiring for a Language Arts/Drama position...but I don't know what you have to have to teach drama.  I was really hoping they'd post a simple English position and then I could be a shoe in.  Shonda came over and gave me some tips on updating my portfolio for if I ever get an interview.  I need to update the resume' for the new jobs, but other than that, they should be easy to submit (they already have a file on me since I sub out there).  I should write an E-mail to the English department chair at FP and see what is up with that drama stuff.  Good thing I rehashed this otherwise I wouldn't have remembered!

OK ... time to watch TV or do something else.  I am getting computered out."

"event","So I am in the 'middle of vacation,' right? I guess I should update then, right?  I will start with today and then maybe I'll backtrack. Today I got up and went to look at a duplex in Puyallup.  I had high hopes for this one!  I really did like it, except it had no dishwasher!  Can you imagine no dishwasher?  I can't.  So right now I am looking online at countertop dishwashers.  Does that sound like a good idea?  I hope so!

After that, Shonda came over and we went out to Quiznos for lunch.  It was very busy!!!  It was good, though.  Then it was off to Snoqualmie Falls in the rain.  It was a good time, for sure :)  They were doing controlled slow downs on I-90 for work on powerwires, which was pretty weird to see.  The falls were gorgeous and would be really cool to see in the summer (and possibly hike to the bottom).  We then toutled through Snoqualmie and North Bend and all the way to Rattlesnake Lake (a name which Shonda was uncomfortable with).  Then it was back to I-90 and Issaquah.  We went to the Boehm's candy factory!  Oh my...the chocolate.  We each had a hand dipped ice cream bar and wondered around the Swiss estate.  I am upset that I have never been there before after driving by it a million times :)  We returned to my place after that and worked on compileing some information for job applications.  What fun :)  Shonda took off after that and I went to gather up a phone number for another potential apartment.  I also needed gasoline ($$$ :( ) so I got that on my way.  I went up to Lowe's and Sears looking for countertop dishwashers, but I couldn't find one there.  I guess I should have gone to Target since I just searched online and found one there.  I just watched two episodes of QaF, which I got in the mail today. 

So now back to yesterday?  Sure, why not.  I went to pick up my mom at the airport around noon and then we went to lunch at Mitzel's.  I got her home and then I ran up to Bellevue Community College to meet Deb and her girlfriend for a talk about homosexuality and choice or not, etc. etc.  I'm sure you're getting the drift.  We went to dinner at Cuchina Presto (which I had never been to before) and then I headed home.  I didn't sleep well at all last night and I think I need to work on that.  I am still messed up from the time change.  I think I'll take an excedrine PM and that will help tonight.  

Tomorrow it's off to the doctor in the morning and back here to work on housing stuff.  I have plenty to do with that, still.  Pay bills, clean up around the house, and laundry are also important to get done before I head out to Laura's for an evening of games with Laura, Deb, and Heather.  That should be fun.  I can't believe how quick vacation has gone.  I am not back to Rite Aid until Monday but I was informed when I called that I will be working Sundays forever more starting NEXT Sunday.  Oh, boy, I can't wait.

So what else to talk about?  I think I am way too cheerful.  I mean my life sucks, but it doesn't sound like it, does it?  Now, if I could just find somewhere to live..."

"event","Well, today was the day of my grandmother's memorial.  Everything went great.  She will definitely be missed.  I got to see a lot of old family and old family friends...none of which were particularly outstanding.  It's unfortunate that she lived to be 97 because all of her friends are already dead!  Could have been quite a funeral if she had died 10-15 years ago.  My grandpa's was very well attended, I do believe.  Everything is said and done now...back to regular life.

I took today off as a funeral day so I can get paid for it.  I only subbed a day and a half this week and only worked two shifts at Rite Aid.  That makes for a pretty odd week in itself.  I have next week off as vacation.  I am going to finalize my moving plans and work on getting a full time teaching job.  I had dinner today (after the funeral) with my dad and Marc, my brother.  We went to IHOP and got a lot of talking done.  I don't get to do dinner with both of them much.

Tomorrow it's off to Ellensburg with Shonda and her boyfriend (Carter).  They need to go over and check out the cat they are adopting.  Shonda invited me along to give them a tour of the town :)  We will stop by and say hi to Marc at work...  Also, tomorrow is church and I am worship leader.  It's back to daylight savings time tonight, which means it's really 12:49 not 11:49 :(  Not much sleep I guess.  That doesn't matter since I have been up lately all night coughing.  I might have to swing by the doc and get something for that this week.  I am supposed to stop by there anyway (they sent a letter and it said they want to know what medications I am taking).

Now...time for bed!"

"event","After ages, I am actually sitting down to write something!  

This has been a crazy week and it's just starting.  My grandma died yesterday so today it's been all about working things out for the funeral.  Today I was supposed to go on a hike with a 'girl' friend of mine, but I called her this morning and canceled.  She is going with her girlfriend, anyway.  I didn't sleep well at all last night, which is pretty odd since I have been sleeping great lately.  There could be two reasons why I didn't sleep well...I have grandma on my mind, and I have a very mild, yet irritating, cold.  I got up and took some Alka seltzer cold and cough and then I actually fell asleep.  I got at call at 6:30 from the manager at Rite Aid and he wanted me to work on Thursday evening (to make it so someone could work Saturday since I will be at the funeral).  I told him I would work on that...since I already have a million plans for Thursday.  After I got up (late, since I wanted to get some sleep!) I started working on balancing everything out.  I am having lunch with my friend Shonda today, tomorrow I am going to see an apartment, having dinner with my dad, and then going shopping with my mom for a suit to wear to the funeral.  Whew...I know it sounds easy to work all that out, but believe me, it wasn't.  I canceled my subbing on Friday and wrote an E-mail to the teacher requesting me to explain things.  I can still sub tomorrow, maybe.

What's cool is that after Friday night I don't work again for at least a week!  I am cashing out my remaining week of vacation from Rite Aid.   The funeral is on Saturday, Sunday is church, so I will still be busy through the weekend...but then...ah...bliss ;)  No kids, no Rite Aid.  I do need to look for jobs and also for a new apartment.  I really want to get that hammered out next week.  This place is driving me crazy.  Unfortunately, everything has to fall together perfectly for that, too.  I'm not going to move into a place that doesn't have washer/dryer (or at least hookups) in the unit.  It needs to be a one bedroom and I hope it will let Dingo move with me too (she is asleep on top of the couch right now).  If I don't get to bring her, I don't know what I'm gonna do.  We'll see.

It would be nice to do some fun stuff next week, too, but who knows about that.  I haven't 'seen' anyone in ages.  It really would have been nice to have someone to cuddle up with last night....maybe I would have slept better.

Well, there is an update Shonda just called and so I better go meet her :)"

"event","I don't know if I've been as jazzed in a long time as I am tonight.  I went to graduation for FP class of 2004 and while the ceremony itself was run of the mill the afterward time was amazing.  Two kids from the French class I am currently substituting (also in a class I substituted frequently last year) were thrilled to see me (why?  I don't know...a question I have yet to get an answer for).  Also kids that I had when I did my student teaching are graduating and one was especially happy to see me (see question in last statement).  Anyway, the thing that amazed me the most was a girl running up and giving me a jumping hug yelling ""Mr. Herbert"".  So I am thinking who is this girl? after she does that.  It was a student that graduated last year that I had when I was student teaching.  It appears that I made a big difference in her time at FP.  I really had no idea.  She insisted on having her picture taken with me and she even mentioned something that I wrote in her yearbook.  I'm flabbergasted to say the least.  Now I know why I am (or want to be) a teacher.  Now, if I can just keep remembering that every time I throw a kid out of class (like I did today) I'll be fine.

I'm also jazzed because of church last night.  I don't know why but everything seems to be falling in place right and left.  Now if I could only get a job.  Anyway, church is great since things are running so smoothly, especially with all the Leadership Team stuff.  Then I also think about the trip to New Orleans coming up soon and I almost get a tear in my eye I am so ecstatic right now.  Too bad I have to get up and go to school in the morning :(  I'm sure all this good news and good vibes won't last, but I hope I remember it.  Another good thing from tonight was listening to the student speakers at the graduation (they do it like EHS...no validictorian or anything like that).  Good stuff to say the least.  I'd almost like to see a copy of it.  I guess that's just an FYI.  Back to subbing and Rite Aid tomorrow and then play ketchup on Saturday and Sunday to get the apartment in to shape and groceries probably, among other things.

Yippie skippie!"

I wrote up three kids from yesterday and there was one kid that was swearing constantly and I wrote him up too after giving him numerous warnings.  He really bugs me.  The other guys just left early from class, which only bugs me because two of them have been pretty nice so far.  I'm not going to take any crap though...especially from the class with the three kids in it.  They were treating their other teacher very poorly so I don't have any problems dishing it out.  I think they are lucky they didn't get the heave-ho since I've been there.  Lucky them.  One more thing about school was that is was the seniors last day and a few of them are begging me to go to graduation tomorrow so I think I will do that.  The kids that are graduating are the ones that I had in class when I was student teaching sophomores.  It will be nice to see some of them wrapping it all up.

Today was a busy day.  Two meetings at church afterschool, but they are monthly ones so it really sounds like a bigger deal than it really is.  The evening meeting went pretty long tonight but everyone had a lot to say.  I had to present a couple of things myself.  It went OK though.  

I had Taco Time for dinner tonight and it was tasty...I went to the grocery store on the way home but I forgot to get something to put in my lunch to drink so I'll have to drink a pop tomorrow.  Oh well, the Pepsi (caffeine free, of course) will do just fine.  I got some cookies...I've been craving those for some reason.

Tomorrow is another fun day of school :)  Not really anything out of the ordinary other than 'connections' time where I meet up with students and give them a reading test.  They get the results back next school year.  It's the same test every year...they are supposed to improve every year, also, I think.  Anyway, I don't mind.  I am getting tired of the students just sitting around anyway, so the shorter period will be OK.  The last class of the day is always the challenging one....lots of screwballs that don't care about their grade.  Oh well, I guess I don't care either :)  I only care if the students care.  Well, at least I try to play it that way.

Tah tah for now."

"event","Amazing!  Anyway, there is so much to fill in that I'm sure I won't be able to do it all.  I've been subbing constantly and it's been a tough road to hoe.  I won't go into details now, though.  I've been working at Rite Aid, too, so I'm going crazy with busy-ness.  That adds up to about 55 hours per week plus other things too, like church stuff.  Thankfully, I finally have tonight off so I can at least update things.  I also did so some stuff around the house and even got some sleep.  I'm playing catch-up in that department.  So there is this week and next week at school and then a 'week off' if you will, and then I am supposed to be subbing a week of summer school.  I haven't gotten all the details on that yet, but it's coming up soon.  It will be good to have the extra dough so that I can afford the trip to New Orleans in August with Diane.  We're going to take Amtrak down and then I'll fly (yuck) back.  Diane gets to stay there for school.  Lucky her.  She was happy until she found out that Tulane is in a high crime area of New Orleans (actually, after some research, most of New Orleans is high crime).  Now she is a bit concerned, but I'm sure everything will be fine.  Just have to watch our Ps and Qs.  I'm not really there that long, only a few days.  The train ride down takes up the bulk of the week.

So what else is up?  The dream job at Franklin Pierce has vanished...actually, it was changed to a math position.  Sucks to be me, I guess.  I did apply for a position in Fife, but I think everyone and their brother applied for that one.  I need to do more scouting.  I'm not sure what else there is to talk about in this respect.  I am pretty frustrated.  If something doesn't come up for fall I AM going to register for some sort of classes in Jan or Feb and try to broaden my horizons.  I'm not sure what I'll do, but maybe I'll try getting certified in different areas.  I don't really want to think about that now, though.  I just want a full time teaching job!

Ack, so much to do, and so little time.  The place is pretty messy since I've been so busy.  Oh well.  The neon needs some work and the extra dough from subbing should come in handy for that too.  Also, it will be good to pay down some credit cards.    If I keep talking the subbing money will be all gone!  I should stop while I'm ahead, I think.  

I really should get to cleaning up things around here before bed time.  I'm cleaning out the E-mail box, too."

Favorite Library Aide memory...well, of course, there is putting the newspapers on the sticks!  I wonder if they still have those sticks?!?!

Funniest story I haven't told you?!?!  I've told you everything, haven't I?  Let's see...  I can't even think.  I don't do funny stuff, do I?  I actually used to think Mike Moore was cute in high school.  Not only is that funny, but weird.  Not really a story, but funny nonetheless.

"event","Everything is going so peachy there isn't anything to write about.  Ok, there really is.  Let me fill you in.  I have applied for my dream job and I am very hopeful that I get it!  The problem is that none of the teachers  know anything about it so it's the mystery job.  It is English and I got a few letters of recommendation turned in with some updated stuff.  I want it so bad I can taste it!  I subbed yesterday and today at the school I want to  work at.  I am starting to really know how everything works after doing this over two years!  Now I need a real job.

So let's see...I'll go back a bit, but not too far...if I don't remember it it must be too far.  Saturday I worked at Rite Aid and the manager wanted me to do about a million things and I wrote a little note and said, yeah, right, like I was ever going to get all that done.  It was insane.  It's been very busy out there.  Busier than it's supposed to be, but we've had really good weather and that may be making a difference.

Then Sunday I went to Seattle with my mom and step dad and had dinner with my step dad's mom since she is still dealing with the loss of her husband.  We ate at Outback.  Boy, there are some cute guys working there.  I need to remember that if I am ever looking for somewhere to eat in Seattle. Go to the Outback on Aurora.  Also working on resume and letter for the job I want.  It looked good to me and my mom took a look at it and we did some revision.  Yay.

Monday I subbed and tried to get all my letters of recommendation in order.  Then I was supposed to go to 'lunch' with Shonda but she was home sick.  Instead, i went to the doctor and he took a look at my eye.  I have a bad stye that I've had for over a week.  Today it is doing better after getting some medication and also applying warm washcloths to it for 15 minutes at a time.  I went and got the rx filled and picked up some dinner and then came home.  Last night I typed up a bunch of stuff (for church, subbing notes, resume and letter wrap up).  I don't remember what else I did.  Today I subbed again and then dropped off my application and also got gas, stopped by church, and also went to see my dad.  After that I came home and took a nap.  Tonight I vacuumed, cleaned windows, loaded up the dishwasher, among other things.  Then I wrote some E-mails and chatted with Diane.  Mr. Date now known as Chad was thinking about coming over tonight, but it's pretty late now so I guess not.  

Tomorrow a bit of a rest, I think.  I am working at Rite Aid in the afternoon/evening.  Not subbing as of now, but that could change.  I am subbing again on Thursday.  Quite a week, really.  I need to grab a bite to eat now and then take my antibiotic for my eye.  I hope it goes away so I don't have to deal with it anymore. 

Enough for now...I think..."

"event","There is actually stuff going on and I just haven't remembered to log on and write about it.  Maybe now I can catchup.  Today I took my brother and three friends to the airport (VERY early) so they could go to a wedding in Florida.  My mom is meeting them there.  They are all flying back on the same flight.  Get to pick them all up on Sunday!  Went to dinner at IHOP with my dad tonight.  Very good, as usual.  I didn't sub today, napped after that early morning trip to the airport.  Tonight I got another media shelf put together (third one this month) and did some rearranging in the bedroom, too.  Vacuumed a little and did some laundry, too.  Tomorrow I am subbing 1/2 a day and then a church meeting in the evening.  I got all set for subbing in the White River School District yesterday...with one exception.  They may have lost my 1/2 of my application!  Grrrrr.  I suspect they found it today since I didn't get a phone call.  If they don't find it then I need to gather all that stuff together again...which is not an easy task (I would tell you more, but that would take all night, seriously...you don't know how much teacher's have to have in their applications!).  I want a full time job so bad!  Hopefully something will open up at Franklin Pierce since there was an English teacher there that didn't get his contract renewed.  Even the other English teachers are hopeful that I will get a position there!

Ok, now to backtrack.  Today is Wednesday, right?  Yesterday I did the White River thing and worked at Rite Aid...a pretty full day, actually.  Monday was forgettable...since I don't remember what I did.  I think I did a couple of loads of laundry, though.  Sunday was much more interesting.  I went to church and then to Ellensburg and hung out with Lucho.  I tried to fix his watch but I think I broke it.  I guess I'll get him a new one when they go on sale.  I did treat him to ice cream for being a good boy...I would go into details, but I won't.  I'll just say this, good boy for himself, not for me :)  We actually saw his old boyfriend driving somewhere and he freaked out and then thought he was seeing him on every street!  We swung by Rite Aid and I checked in with Carol about a couple of things.  Their sales are up after down-down after Fred Meyer came into town.  Our store is up too, so that's cool, Rite Aid must be doing something right, finally.    We went out to Diane's house, but only to drop off packing peanuts for her Ebays.  She was in Wenatchee for some relative's wedding reception.  If she would have been in town we would have hung out some of the time.  Lucho and I played a round of Sorry! with one of his friends...and I haven't played that in ages.  Also watched Chicken Run (not very closely) and played with Trivial Pursuit cards.  Ate dinner at Perkins and then it was pretty much time to head home.  Yippie.  Oh, on the way home I stopped by and saw my bro and that's when he told me he needed a ride to the airport.  So now we've made a full circle.  Yay.

One more thing...I talked about Mr. Date last time ( I Think).  Well, I haven't heard a word from him in days.  Since we met last Monday ( a week and a half ago) I got one E-mail from him and that's it.  No phone calls...and before we met he was E-mailing me at least daily!  Oh well, not the end of the world, but another one for the 'liar' pile.  This should not be surprising...but it always is to gullible me.  Go figure."

Today I had a leadership thing at church from 9 until 1 so then I went by my dad's place for a few minutes and I came home and took a nice, long nap.  I woke up about an hour ago and I have been playing SimCity 3000 and then I chatted with a guy from Seattle.  Now I am working on making dinner.  I don't really have anything going on tonight, but I am planning on going over to Ellensburg tomorrow to see Lucho and maybe even my brother.  Diane will be in Wenatchee which is really a pain in the neck since I have a big bag of packing supplies for her E-bay stuff.  The Daffodil Parade was today but I didn't have anyone to go with so that's why I came home and napped.  So there's filling in on what's going on...I heard back from Mr. Date and he is all for getting together again.  I should E-mail him back.  I was starting to wonder since we got together on Monday I hadn't heard from him.  Apparently his work called him in one day and that made him very busy...too busy to write E-mail.  

So there is some valuable information for you all.  Now I just need to find something to keep me occupied tonight :)"

Nobody has any consideration for anyone else and it drives me crazy.  Maybe I just attracted people that aren't considerate?  I don't know.  So I guess I'm not to upset at Mr. Date since I haven't even met him anyway, but it just really gets on my nerves.  Lots of fish in the sea, right?  Sure whatever.  

Instead of doing anything fun, I went to the grocery store and spent $80.  That was sort of fun in itself.  Very busy...and so late!  Everyone must go grocery shopping on Wednesday nights.  I did get a lot of stuff picked up around the house.  I'm not sure if it's allergies or if I'm catching a cold, but I have had the sniffles all day.  I took an Actifed and then took a nap and that seemed to help.  We'll see...I hope it's just allergies.

Why don't I think my life is a waste of time?  I don't know.  It's interesting to note though that work has gotten me into that mood.  I think that's why I decided to devote more time to subbing.  I mean, come on, after four and a half years of college and another two of subbing, I am finally ready to be a teacher.  I'm not in college...I'm not doing something meaningless right now (hehehe I mean subbing doesn't seem meaningless).  So I don't feel so bad. Maybe I should feel bad that I haven't found Mr. Right.  Well, that will happen in due time, I have to believe.  There is nothing more I would want right now than that, but that will take time.  I am so sort of unsocial that that's a hinderance.  Something to work on.  It is nice to see some people going after the things that they want and not letting their mood keep them down.  It just seems like those people are a minority.  Everyone has their ups and downs, I guess, but I have been fortunate that the downs have not taken over my life.  I still have a positive attitude I'd say and maybe that's what keeps me going.  Here's knocking on wood hoping everything stays that way!

Today I am doing more clean up around the house.  Maybe a date toight.  I got a cryptic message from Mr. Date and so I'm not really sure what's going on.  He said he didn't have 'net access so he needed my phone number.  I gave it to him.  We are supposed to see a movie or come back to my place for a movie or something like that.  Until then I have vacuuming to finish, cleaning to do, errands to run (post office, grocery store, maybe even an oil change).  Wish me luck :)  Next week I start my reduced  Rite Aid schedule, which should be nice...except I have a million other things going on now!  Sunday is Easter...which is actually a pretty normal day.  It would be nice to find someone to hang out with in the afternoon since it's going to be so nice (74 maybe!?!?).  Monday I'm off...ok yeah, some free time...unless I'm able to sub.  I need to find out about the application I took to White River and find out why they haven't gotten in touch with me.  Tuesday night I have a meeting concerning church, two on Wednesday (one in the afternoon and one in the evening), and a mini retreat on Saturday.  Whew, quite the schedule.  Hopefully, subbing on at least 3 days, too.

There, now everyone knows what keeps me going!  Sheer busy-ness.   Sounds like fun, doesn't it?"

I shipped a book I sold, did some laundry and ironing, went to dinner with my dad (IHOP was very tasty) and wrote a ton of E-mails.  I've finally cleaned out my inbox after four months.  It sounds like I might have a date for Wednesday night (another night off!) but we'll just have to wait and see.  I also got a bunch of notes typed up for church which is a relief.  I'm glad I was only the fill in secretary!

So it's back to Rite Aid tomorrow.  Yippie!  It's shipment day so that means things should go by quickly.  I ordered quite a bit of stuff for photo and school supplies.  I can't tell you how tired I am of even going to the store.  Good thing that next week I should be dropping down to around 20 hours a week instead of my normal 37 or so.  I hope I can sub a more next week.  I got a call for today for May 6 and I have a whole week towards the end of May.  I soooooo want a full time subbing job...I can't wait...give me one now!

I got a call this afternoon and found out the one of the teachers I usually sub for had an emergency and wanted me to sub Thursday and Friday.  So that makes eight days in a row at Rite Aid and then two full days of subbing and then two more days at Rite Aid ... what does that total?  12 days in a row of full days (two of which I subbed 1/2 a day and then went to Rite Aid).  Whew...I'm not trying to make a big deal out of it, but it blows my mind :)  

Today I worked early and so I had tonight off.  I have to figure out how I am going to pay my taxes!  Yuck!  I'm still not sure, but I did balance the checkbook, get two loads of laundry done, and pay bills.  It's getting late now so I should take a shower and get ready for subbing tomorrow and then sleeeeeeeeeep.  

Anything else happen today?  I don't think so.  No more time!  I did order a pizza for dinner.  I haven't had pizza in ages.  It was very tasty.  Listening to '90s music on the TV ( I have digital music channels) and that sort of made my night.  I did play a round of online Canasta with Diane...which I won!  Yay, I am on a roll.  OK, only two wins, but that's better than I usually do.  

Like I said, tomorrow subbing.  Then home for a bit...maybe to vacuum like I've been putting off for ages?  and then a meeting at church.  Doesn't sound too bad.

I looked at the key to the door and it was bent to form a 90 degree angle!  Very odd.  I tried to bend it back and it still doesn't work.  Luckily, I left the front window unlocked so I just opened it, reached around to the door handle and unlocked it.  Nobody get any ideas...I don't have anything valuable anyway.  It might be cool to find someone at home for a change, though :)  

So today was a major drag.  Nothing big, just boring.  I got up and hung around the house doing absolutely nothing, in spite of the fact that I really need to do some cleaning.  Then I went to work where I worked my butt off on a million different things.  Went to Arby's for lunch, which is something I do no more than once a week.  There are a couple of reasons.  One is that Arby's is rather expensive for fast food (in spite of it being very tasty) and another is that it is on the other side of the gridlock on weeknights.  I treat myself on the weekend and head on over to get a roast beef.  

So that catches you up on the day.  I was dreaming on the way hope about actually having a boyfriend.  What a silly concept.    Can't say I don't try.  Looks like no date #2 with the guy I was talking about earlier this week.  I don't like thinking about all this silly finding a guy stuff...I just want one, enough said.

Like I said...enough said."

"event","Nothing going on.  Hehehe.  I guess there is stuff going on but it seems so unimportant in comparison to what other people are dealing with or something, so I just feel like everything is run of the mill.   Worked today and it wasn't quite as bad as it's been.  I kept myself busy.  Tomorrow I work early and then have a meeting for church in the evening.  Friday is a bit more interesting since I sub and then off to Rite Aid.  I got some laundry done today and help the neighbor move some stuff out.  The aparments on either side of me are empty!  Nobody likes me :(  She wanted to pay me $20 for helping her for maybe 20 minutes.  I was like no way...it was no big deal!  Anyway, it was a change of pace.  I still have two loads of laundry I need to do but I forgot to get quarters at work!  I can't do any tomorrow or Friday anyway...but maybe Saturday.

That's all for now.  Time to relax for a bit and then head to bed."

"event","I can see that question coming from a mile away.  So the answer is (que drum roll) I drove to Everett.  It was very fun actually...much better than sitting at home, that's for sure.  So I left here at about 6:10.  It only took me an hour and 10 minutes to get there!  I am as surprised and shocked as you are, I can tell.  So I got there at 7:20 and of course Mr. Date is still busy at work (not really work, but a work related thing) and I just drive around aimlessly for 45 minutes in which time I get to know downtown Everett and also the nearby Rite Aid (can't NOT go in if I have the extra time) and I also got gas.  So then Mr. Date is done and I hop in his very cute SUV.  Nice and new...I like it.  So we drive around a bit...we stopped to let him go to the bathroom.  We talked a ton.  We parked overlooking the water (it was a gorgeous night) and then we went back to his work for a bit...just to hang out, but it was getting late by now.  He did have to work in the morning and I had the short...eh...I mean long drive back to Sumner.  All was well.

The drive home was OK...the only problem is by 12 midnight all the construction projects are started.  Of course, every time the road is down to one lane I am behind a slow poke.  Oh well.  I stopped off in Renton to grab at bite at the BK...I'd call that a mistake.  Tooooook forever!  When I got to Kent I realized that that BK is open 24 hours too so I should have stopped there (easier access, closer to home, probably people that know what they are doing running the place).  Oh, I forgot to mention my experience with the cashier at BK.  My total was $1.73.  I give him $5.03.  He gives me back $1.35.  Do you see a problem here?  I did and he was like 'what, I owe you a dollar?"" and I was like ""no, I gave you $5.03 and the total was $1.73 so you owe me $3.30"" and he was like ""huh"" but he did give me the right change.  I swear he must have been 1/2 asleep.

Anyway, got home and In-Demanded the E! true Hollywood story of Mariah Carey.  It is cool to watch shows with no commercials.  Only took me 40 minutes to watch a 1 hour show.  Then it was time for bed (the BK had settled by now).

Today I have a whole list of things to do, let's see if I can get them all done.  Lucho is supposed to come by sometime and if it's before dinner or after dinner maybe I will check in with my dad and we can grab a bite.  Well, if I am going to get anything done, I guess I should quit typing!!!

BTW, whoever is reading this, thanks...it's amazing anyone would care about my ramblings, even you Diane :)"

"event","Don't have chicken soup much, but I just finished a bowl.  It was pretty good.  Actually, I couldn't find anything that really looked good, and the soup looked OK, so I picked that.

I have something up with my eyelid today..it's been bugging me for a while but it was finally swollen this morning.  I haven't done a thing all day except dishes.  I did go out and get the mail, but nothing but a Fred Meyer 'how do you like our store' questionaire.  Oh, mom said she thinks the eyelid thing is just a sty so I shouldn't worry about it.

The minute I turned on the computer this morning the guy I was supposed to see on Saturday night messaged me.  He was all appologetic and I was very honest with him about how I didn't much care for it.  He didn't take a lot of responsibility (lots of excuses) but at least he did say sincerely that he was sorry.  Anyway, it seems like we've been chatting on and off all day.  Eventually, he wants to know if I want to come up today.  So a couple of things are running through my mind...go and maybe you'll have fun, I think.  Then there is the whole Saturday thing that makes me mad...and then there is the traffic.  He is doing work related things until 8 in Everett so I would meet him there after work.  Hum, who doesn't like an hour and 15 minute drive that takes over two hours?  Well, that's what it would be since to get there at eight I would be leaving around six.  Couldn't be a worse time to drive on 405.  Anyway, I nix that idea...and anyway Lucho was supposed to come by on his way home.

So Lucho finally calls.  Not surprisingly he doesn't really want to stop by today since he is already late for getting home to Port Townsend.  Can't blame him there...but this is all typical Lucho :)  I let him off the hook since he says he will be by tomorrow (I am off that day too!).  So now I am actually thinking about doing the drive to Everett just to spice up my day.  And still thinking...and thinking...and remembering that since I am one person I can't use the HOV lane...thinking about taillights and road rage and thinking I really don't want to.  We'll see what I actually decide.

I could always stay home and do laundry and vacuum.  Sure, now that's real fun.  I think Seventh Heaven and Everwood are reruns tonight but i should check.  Maybe that should be the decision maker...reruns, go to Everett...new episodes stay home?

So maybe I will sub tomorrow and maybe not.  Either way, back at Rite Aid on Wednesday (shoot me now).  It was so dead yesterday ... I did stupid stuff all day, but I never felt like I got anything done.  Oh well.  I should vacuum now so I can clear my head."

"event","Today was the day for Dave's (my stepdad) father's funeral in North Seattle.  Started out the day fine, but it just ended up being OK and that's all.  Was headed up north and I ended up in a big traffic jam, which isn't surprising for Seattle.  So I got off the freeway.  I really hate sitting (as opposed to at least moving slowly) in traffic.  I took Airport Way into downtown and the cruised through Capital Hill (if you've been to Capital Hill you know that you can't actually cruise since the streets are barely wider than the car) and got back on I-5 at Mercer.  Actually, I took the express lanes from there.  Upon reaching the exit I was supposed to take I tried to call my mom for complete directions but there was no answer.  So I am sitting on the exit ramp (which it was pure luck that I got to since I had to cross four lanes of traffic from the express lanes to get to) wondering if I should go left or right.  I choose left.  Wrong move.  After about 10 minutes I finally got ahold of mom and spend at least another 10 minutes heading in the opposite direction--back towards the church.

Well, at least I made it.  The church was crazy old, but not pretty old, old like outdated.  I won't go into details, but since I am on the 'leadership team' at church I am starting to notice things about churches.  I told Marc, my brother, that they need to do a SWOT analysis on the building (stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) and come up with a plan since the current building is falling apart at the seams.  Anyway, that's what we've been doing at church, but not just for the building.  Lots of information to provide at the next Lteam meeting.

The Funeral was good...not too long and not too short.  And another good thing/bad thing is that I know practically no one on that side of the family.  That's good 'cause then I don't have to talk to anyone.  That's bad since there is no one to talk to :)  So Marc and I took off and I brought him back to Sumner to meet his girlfriend since they drove over together.  Then off they went back to Ellensburg.  I got home and was just picking things up a bit since it's been such a busy day.  I messaged someone I've been talking to online for a while and we talked a bit and then he was all freaking out that he had to go since he had a wedding reception to go to.  Alright, no biggie, I think.  Anyway, he wanted to call me.  I was like, why?  Long story short, I don't like talking on the phone and I talked him out of calling and instead we sort of arranged a date.  He would call me when he was done with his shindig and we'd go from there.  Probably a movie, so I told him I'd check into it and we'd hit one of the theatres near Alderwood Mall.  All well and good...he takes off for his event.

I'm minding my own business and I get a phone call (actually, it is almost immediately right after another phone call--church related and no big deal) and it's him talking about how he's on his way to the reception.  I'm like OK, good to know, hear from you when you're done.  I continue buzzing around the house and I look up the movies and find a couple of at least OK ones (they couldn't be scary or sad as per my date).  Not a lot of good movies playing, by the way.  Finally, after a couple of hours I get the call, and he's ready to head for the theatre...or so I thought.  We talk about what movie to see at what time...no problem there...sounds like it's a quick trip for him but I have to spend an hour to get there (which isn't the end of the world, but I realized I should have had him drive a little further just so we could catch an earlier movie...all afterthought, of course).  I hop in the car after a few more minutes, including making sure my hair and clothes are OK and grab CDs and a bottle of water for the drive.  Off I go.  After about 15 minutes on the road low and behold mr. date calls and has changed his mind.  Actually, not really changed, but definately not wanting to meet but since I'm on my way, fine, let's do it.  I was like ... no no no... not a big deal i am still close to home.  That's sort of a cop out on my part but who wants to go on a date with someone that really doesn't want to go.  His excuse was that he had a few drinks and he wanted to be on his best behavior for someone he's meeting.  To him I say ok and then he says how about next week.  Well, I'm working nights pretty much all week so I was like no that's not gonnna work...but he was like OK I will check with you during the week...sure whatever I say.  

So now I'm sort of pissed, even though I'm sort of not.  Let me explain.  I am upset since I was all set on seeing a movie, which would have been a nice change of pace.  And it also would have been nice to meet up with someone.  Check.  Also upset since doing something was his idea and he changed his mind after I freaking LEFT!  I talked to him three times before he called and cancelled.  I'm sort of not upset, though, since I would rather not meet up with someone that really doesn't want to.  Or maybe I'm also not upset because if he had a couple drinks and is worried about making a bad impression actually makes a bad impression in itself.  

OK, so there is a good story for tonight.  We'll see what he says next.  Let's just say I'm not going out of my way for this one.  On other cool thing was on my way before I turned around I saw a truck on fire in the other lanes.  It was fresh, too, since there weren't any emergency vehicles yet.  I did see one when I got off the freeway that was on it's way there, though.  Now I think i will find something on DVD to watch...if I can keep from falling asleep."

"event","I know...two days in a row.  What can I say, but true devotion to the cause.   Well, last night I got to talk to this cute guy.  It was fun, for once.  Anyway, of course he lives in Ellensburg.  I am destined to be in Ellensburg I think.  I mean it seems like I'm always there, and the only people I 'meet' live there (curses on CWU).  He even knew Lucho.  It's true though, I should get over there to visit...I haven't been for a while.  Diane is back from Las Vegas, but she vanished last night when I thought we might play a game.  I'm sure will find some time this week to play...

Work was boring as usual.  I so want to quit, it's not even funny.  I am planning on writing a note to the manager tomorrow asking him to drop me down to 15 hours a week until summer.  Then I can sub mostly and not deal with it too much.  I just can't deal with it anymore!  I'd quit, but then I would definately have to track down another job for summer.  And at least this way I can keep my benefits for a little while.  

Tomorrow I'm subbing.  Yay!  The teacher says she has one devilish class and specifically wanted me to 'handle' them.  We'll see how I do.  I've had some pretty challenging classes, but it's odd that the ones the teachers say are challenging to them usually aren't to me.  Case in point Friday at Washington.  The fourth period class ended up being horrible while the second period class that the teacher specifically mentioned being difficult was actually better than the average class.  Thankfully, the most difficulty most classes give me is just being noisy.  Other than trying to get out of doing work, that's about the only thing that they really abuse subs with.  They don't superglue the chair or put kick me signs on my back so it's all good.

Right now I've gotta start getting ready for bed since it's an early day.  I'm really not that tired, though.  It's pretty warm in here...I forgot to turn down the heat before I left for work.  I just realized that I work at 8:00 to 4:00 on Tuesday and then don't work again until 2:15 on Wednesday so that will be a nice break.  Any time out of work makes me happy I guess!  More tomorrow if I'm not slacking..."

"event","I was updating this for once (other than the survey) and I closed the window and it was gone.  I gotta start over :( 

This week I took vacation from Rite Aid.  Not really much of a vacation though, since I subbed 3 1/2 days.  I also subbed Thursday and Friday of last week and I will be subbing on Monday so I've been pretty busy.  I also vacuumed the car and cleaned the house this week, but you can hardly tell now since the house could use cleaning again.  I had tons of church stuff going on this week, which is both good and bad (keeps me busier!).  I have to go back to Rite Aid tomorrow and I really don't want to.  Sometimes I wished I still worked in Ellensburg, but that store isn't the same any more, really.  I miss the good old days.  No Fred's or Rite Aid...PayLess all the way.

Since I haven't updated in forever, I should say something about real work.  I applied for a long term sub gig at White River, but alas, they filled it.  I am still planning on regular subbing up there soon.  All I have to do is take my immunization test results up there and they should be able to complete the application.  I am dying to work full time out at Frankin Pierce, but I don't know what I can do to take some nice English teacher out with a baseball bat or something so I can get a gig :)  Just kidding, of course.  They want me out there too, but there has to be a POSITION available!  

What else should I talk about?  How bored I am?  How much I wish I had a significant other?  Ha, that's just the same old blab.  I did play SimCity 3000 the other day and that was sort of fulfilling.  I hope the survey results below don't scare anyone, especially me!  

I've been watching Q a F the third season and I only have one episode left.  I guess I will start over with season one again after that.  Boy, I wish I had a few more new ones to watch.  There are bonus features to go through, though.  

Upcoming--I'm subbing on Monday like I said, and then a couple of regular and weird shifts at work.  I might be able to sub on Wednesday and/or Friday, but it really does make for a long day when you leave home at 6:45 a.m. and get home at 10:45 p.m.  Yeah, I do get 1/2 hour lunch all alone at Rite Aid and some travel time between the two, but still!!!  Not a fun day.  I wish I could just sub, but I have to have benefits and those only come from Rite Aid.  

I'm sure I have more than made up for not writing for three months with this entry, right?  Plus all the pearls of wisdom in the survey (like you really want to know what my last meal would be!!!).  It's time to load up the dishwasher and have a bite to eat.  Don't forget the last episode of QaF...and some prep for Sunday School tomorrow.  Gotta have something to fill my time..."

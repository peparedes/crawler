"event","I think I've been computerless for three weeks now.  

I need three parts to be back in business:

$101 - Motherboard (the part that actually died)
$206 (from $236) - Processor (because the old one won't fit a new MB :o  )
~$70 - Memory (also because the old stuff won't work, and it would be a bottleneck if it did)
total right now, approximately $377.  Ouch.

But I do have the motherboard on the way now :D and the processor price keeps dropping so by the time I save up enough for that it may be under $200 :D

I realize I haven't posted here in a month.  hehe oops :\

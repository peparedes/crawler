"event","Referring to my previous statement, my amazing adviser has managed to get my pass/fail grade for Intro to Terrorism reversed into an actual, which means that I will graduate if I pass all my classes. AWESOME! That takes alot of pressure off of me. Telling my mom I might not graduate was terrible, but the fact that it opened up a whole new can of worms about whether or not I will walk at graduation was almost worse. She's determined to get me to walk at graduation, and quite frankly, I don't want to. It's a long, stupid, boring ceremony where we're told that we've accomplished so much, and then they give us a diploma that will very likely help me get an extra fifty cents an hour from whatever fifties diner, chain hotel, or family gym I end up working at. My mom see this as her oldest daughter graduating from college---something she always regretted not doing. Slap on more sympathy why don't we?<br /><br />Yesterday was my day of no classes. I picked up Cassie and Hope from after-school and we went to the playground. I pushed them on the tire swing until they were giggling and screaming that swinging with their eyes closed felt like they were floating in the sky. We played hide and seek. I did a lot of seeking. Once it got too cold to play outside, I took them to the cafeteria. Two hot dogs, two helpings of french fries, two fortune cookies, and two ice cream cones later, I had them back at their house completely exhausted from two five year olds. <br /><br />Last night I couldn't fall asleep, and I'm pretty sure that I only got one or two hours of sleep. I woke up to a text from Cristina that the girls didn't have school so she needed me to babysit. I trudged over here in ankle deep water to watch them. We played some games, watched some <b>Goodburger</b>, and ate some pizza. The two of them devoured an entire large pepperoni pizza themselves. It was disconcerting. The good news is that I got my laundry done, and that I'm periodically distracted by the events of Blues Clues. Apparently this episode explains the change from Steve to Joe. I'm convinced Joe is hitting on me.<br /><br />I missed LOST at its regularly scheduled time, but I watched it this afternoon. I was slightly disappointed because it told us nothing that we already didn't know. There was no new information revealed. I was sorely disappointed. Plus, I miss Charlie. He was my favorite. But the funyn thing about LOST is that one mediocre episode is infinitely better than a phenomenal episode of any other show."

"event","School is starting soon and I'm excited to get back into the swing of things. I miss having something to do. James and I have become so bored with nothing to do that we're beginning to get stir-crazy. I'm looking for a job right now. It makes me sad that I can't work for Cristina anymore. I have a mandatory class from 3-4 on MWF and so I can't get Cassie off the bus anymore. I really enjoyed that job. It paid just about as well as any job around here will and I got to spend my days playing Power Rangers and taking a five year old to the caf. I must say that going to the caf with Cassie is always an amusing experience. I promised I would take her next semester as soon as the cafeteria opened. <br /><br />But back to the job discussion, I have looked all over the internet for decent job prospects with nothing coming up. It really is a terrible time to be looking for a job. Any place that would look favorably on my 5 years of retail experience have already hired all their employees for Christmas and are keeping those for the new year. However, I am looking to work somewhere outside of a store. I have had a job consistently since I was fifteen years with maybe a month or two where I was unemployed, and most of that was spent at a cash register. I really don't want to do any more of that. I really do love working with children; it'd be nice to get another babysitting job. <br /><br />On a different note, I'm going to be making my livejournal friends-only. I realize there are alot of people who read this that aren't livejournal users, however I really would like to avoid any drama associated with this. I write down my thoughts as they come to me for my friends to read and comment on. Yet, some really mean people like to use it to poke fun of me. It really hurts to see someone, who I once considered to be really close friend, be happy that I am unhappy. I like straighten my spine and stand tall and pretend like words don't hurt me, but they do. It really hurts that a good friendship disintegrated over a stupid argument and somehow turned into biting livejournal entries about how I'm a worthless human being. So perhaps if he continues to stalk me he will read this.<br /><br /><i>Dear You: <br />I'm sorry for whatever I may have done that makes you dislike me so intensely. I thought we were on good terms, but perhaps that was my misunderstanding. I <b>am </b>confused about what I want to do in June. I'm not confused over whether or not I'm going to be employed or unemployed. I don't know where I want to live. I don't know what kind of job I want to have. I'm 22 years old, and I do not know what I want to do with the rest of my life. Perhaps that makes me ambitionless. I think it makes me human. I'm glad you have your future lined up, but in my opinion what job I get does not define how successful I am. I was really angry at you at first. You made all these assumptions about how you think I live my life, but you're basing those assumptions on how you live your life. I live my life really differently. You might not approve, but I don't care. Just like I might not approve of many of your decisions, but it doesn't fucking matter--as long as you're happy with them. <br /><br />There is a large part of our friendship I miss. We had alot of laughs and alot of fun together, but the feeling of you constantly judging me and my decisions is one of the things I don't miss. Perhaps I am making assumptions and if I am ignore this, but maybe you should do some soul-searching and thinking really hard about how harshly you judge people. I would never laugh at your pain.</i><br /><br />And from now on, Heather McCartney's thoughts will be friends only."

"event","It's good to be back in Selinsgrove even though I had one of the best Christmas breaks on record. The break started well. I moved out of my dorm and into James's house for a week and a half where I periodically babysat Cassie and did alot of chillin' with James most of the day. I left for home a few days before Christmas. Every year we have a Christmas Eve party at my grandma's. It was nice getting to see the family for the holidays. Visiting with family always brings up the dreaded question of what I plan to do when I graduate in a few months. I'm getting sick of that question--or perhaps I'm getting sick of not knowing the answer to that question. I'm being pulled in alot of directions. I could move to Cape Cod, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Selinsgrove--there are a number of places I could live and people who would want me near them. It's just deciding where to be and what career to follow. Too much to deal with right now.

I spent the beginning of my trip to Ohio with Sarah, Kevin, Alissa and Amber. Kevin spent a few days at the house and that kid makes sitting on my ass in Rogers, Ohio enjoyable. Seriously, if it weren't for Sarah, Kevin and grandpa, I don't think I would be able to spend more than a day in Ohio. Alissa and Amber visited alot this time and it was great just talking to them. Alissa is awesome because we're so dissimilar yet strangely similar to one another. She also has one of those faces that is always smiling and it's infectious. I spent most of these days between Christmas and Joel and Curtis's arrival watching way too many vH1 reality shows. I have an addiction to watching people fight over the affection of a D-List celebrity. It's comic genius in my opinion. The addiction is apparently also shared by Joel. I Love Flavor Flav became the theme of their visit. It was so great seeing them. I missed how funny and awesome they both are. I couldn't stop smiling during their entire visit and it made me feel like it was last summer again--when Curtis lived in our basement apartment and Joel ate Captain Crunch off the floor. Like the last semester didn't happen and I spent my days selling liquor. We only had 2 days to hang out but it was exactly what I needed to relax. 

We spent New Year's Eve with my sister's friend Kathy. We had a great time drinking and watching more vH1 until the ball dropped. We spent the early morning hours reenacting the show. Joel was Flava Flav and we all had to compete for our clocks. I won the challenge where we had to make him the best drink. Grape juice, vodka, and Dr. Pepper. I forget who won the first round, but Sarah snuck in and won the round with Curtis as Flava Flav. Sarah and I got into a mock cat fight. She pretended to spit in my face--in text it's not nearly as funny as it was when we were drunk. 

We went to bed early because I had to wake up at 6:30 to drive Curtis and Joel to my grandma's so they could leave for Massachusetts by 8. I was probably still legally drunk at that point--that was not my wisest choice. Definitely not my least wise choice ever either.

Dan surprised me with a visit from Columbus. We spent the day after New Year's in Pittsburgh together. Dan and I have a habit of randomly going to Pittsburgh and getting pleasantly lost in the city.. His boyfriend Charles came with him and we had an awesome time. We found a stack of complimentary New Years coupons for Hoolihan's. We stole a stack of coupons in hopes of finding the $50 gift certificate coupon. We did find a 3 $10 off coupons only to be thwarted by the fine print: one per table. The waitress tried to get it to slide by, but her manager vetoed it. SInce was eating with two waiters, so we tipped her 40% for trying.&nbsp; I thought I saw Sal Pane in Pittsburgh for a minute, but it was a different skinny emo kid. 

We then went on an expedition to try and find the Mt. Washington Trolley, only to discover it's half a block from our parking garage even though we just paid $4 to get out of the garage. We took some random turn that said something like HDVM HOC--that's probably way off base, but it was a random one way road that required 2 or more passengers. It took us up the mountain and through a tunnel and miraculously arrived at the top of Mt. Washington right next to where the trolley stops at the top. The trolley station is right next to a walkway on Grandview Ave. and leads to an overlook where you can see the entire city in all it's glory. It was beautiful. I dared Dan to pee off of Mt. Washington but he declined due to the people on the street. So we stumbled upon a strange bar before taking the trolley down and back up. It was really fun and definitely something every visitor to Pittsburgh needs to do. We got back way too late for me to drive back to Selinsgrove, so I woke up at 7:30 to drive home in time to pick up Cassie off the bus, only to find out that Cristina's boyfriend was sick and didn't go into work. It was worht it thought--i seeing my friends again was much needed.

Cristina told me that she ran into James Kelley at the mall and he asked her how she was and she said, ""Missing Heather. You?"" and he said, ""Ready to kill myself."" It feels good to be missed,to know that people really care, appreciate, and want my presence in their lives. The people who cut me off because they're not old enough to deal with adult concepts don't matter like these people do. Emotastic, I know. It just feels really good seeing the people in my life who wanted to visit me so badly they drove several hours and then returning to people who genuinely missed me."

"event","Christmas Break 2007-2008 began with a rather depressingly early departure of Chantal Notarstefano. James, Chantal, Zane, Zane's mother, and I spent the evening chillaxin' in the hookah room. I don't even remember when or why I went to bed, which probably means I had a good evening. Finals week was terrible. Far too much studying and work to do for us to completely enjoy it. However, it was a good week, I can't lie. 

Zane and James helped me move some of my crap from my dorm to James's house. I spending most of break here. I really don't want to go home for break. I know I'll just sit on my ass for a couple days until insomnia kicks in and I start sleeping for ten hours every forty-eight. And Jerry Springer-like fights with my mom would eventually begin if I went home. We have a great relationship as long as we're hours away from one another. I have a hard time handling being home for too often. I don't have the patience for my parents and their parenting. I've taken care of myself nearly exclusively for the past five years, so whenever I go home and my mom starts telling me I have chores and when I can leave the house and how I can spend my money--I go a little insane.

I am returning to Ohio for Christmas and New Years. I'm excited about seeing my family for the holidays, and I could not be more excited about seeing Uncle Kevin, Kristy, Curtis and Joel in two weeks! I miss those fucker, and I can't wait to hang out with them. 

The other day I found a Star Trek XP theme that made my cursor the Entrerprise and whenever open a window Picard says ""On screen"" and whenever I close a program Picard says ""Discontinue Program."" Perhaps this makes me the biggest loser ever, but it puts a smile on my face everyday, so fuck off.

Also, Eric and Ed are potentially visiting this weekend. And then I think we're going to Nicole's house either tomorrow or Friday--depending on weather and whether or not they show up.

By the way, where did this fucking snow come from? I woke up completely flabbergasted by the sudden weather change. I spent most of the last few days not wearing a coat. But isn't that central Pennsylvania weather? If you don't like it today, wait a couple days and it'll change.

I just wish James Kelley's heater actually heated the house."

"event","I do not know why I continue to blog. No one reads them. No one comments. However, I enjoy it, so I shall continue.<br /><br />James and I returned to Selinsgrove late Saturday evening to a very cold house and a very alive cat. Hanzo was up our asses most of the night, having been deprived of contact for about four days. James didn't heat the house while we were gone, so we had a slumber party in his bedroom. We cuddled close to the space heater and I eventually fell asleep watching the Star Wars episode of Family Guy. <br /><br />I intermixed writing a paper and visiting with Chantal throughout the day, and then stopped by to introduce my new car to Cristina. They seemed to hit it off. I still need to name my new car. <br /><br />Anyway, the week started out with me spending six hours of Monday playing Final Fantasy and then six hours of Tuesday playing Final Fantasy. I can't lie, it was fun. But that is exactly the problem. Remember when I became addicted to <b>Diablo II</b>? I didn't leave my room for hours. I talked about <b>Slayer CrunchySocks </b>as often as I talked about other people. It was a sickness. Am I ready to get into that again? I'm not even that long out of rehab....<br /><br />Yesterday was fun. I spent the afternoon with Chantal and Cassie. We had dinner together at the caf. It's quite amusing to hear a five year old beg me to take her to ""the caf"" for ""chocolate ice cream and hot dogs."" The three of us had a good time. We played the ""Raise your hand if you have..."" game. I made Cassie laugh so hard she almost peed so we had to leave her ice cream cone in Chantal's reliable hands and run to the bathroom. While Cassie was in the stall, I put on my hood and pulled the strings tight so that all you could see was my eyes (picture Kenny); I figured it'd make her laugh. Well, before she came out, three girls came in dealing with the major crisis of a cut open finger. And I look up as they walk in with their serious faces on, and I look absolutely ridiculous. So I fixed my hoodie and waited patiently for Cassie to make sure she didn't see any blood. Perhaps this is a lame story, but it was really ridiculous to me when it happened.<br /><br />Last night, I got to show off my Halo skillz to some under-Halo-ed white boys. Maybe this is just me, but nothing makes me feel better than to own guys in video games. Especially when they're holding onto the rocket launcher for a good portion of the game. I must admit that I did get my ass kicked by my friend Eric. But in my defense, I had one of the mammoth sized controllers that do not fit well in my hands and also I suck playing stoned. I would be intrigued to see an Eric Rowe v. Eric Koellner Halo 2 dual. Who would win? No one knows..."

"event","I found this really great website online the other day that I've become obsessed with. It's www.urbis.com and it's kind of like a deviant art, but much cooler. You submit your writing for people to review, the catch is that you can't read any of the reviews for your piece unless you review other people's work. You earn credits when you review other works that you can spend on opening the reviews of your pieces. It's kind of like being in a Gary Fincke class, but you can actually skip over any piece that is terribly bad. My only complaint about the site is that you can't just upload from word, you have to copy and paste--which fucks with formatting. 

It's done wonders for my self-esteem. I already have a fan. 

I highly suggest it to anyone out there who likes to write. Even if you use this site for nothing but hosting your writing. Oh, and if you want to sign up, you should let me send you an invitation. Then I earn free credits for signing people up, and I'll all about free credits."

"event","I kidnapped James Tiberius Kelley and crossed state lines. He gets to experience Ohio. Poor kid.

The trip was long and dangerous. We crossed Interstate Buttrape on multiple occasions, and we stopped at a roadside general store that was littered with animal pelts. I really wanted to pee, but I was terrified by the sheer number of animal carcases so waited to find a BP. We took this backroad route rather than my normal trip across I-80 because we were visiting my sister in Pittsburgh. We got there much later than we had intended, and I demanded Sarah take us to Chipotle. Chipotle is a gourmet Mexican place that has the burritos of the gods. We nearly killed ourselves eating them, but it was worth it. Every bite was worth it. Ed and Brittany know.

After dinner we ended up in this ghetto-ass apartment complex where we picked up some stuff from deaf lesbians. Perhaps it was my inebriation, but I decided at that moment that if deaf lesbians can find each other, then anyone can find each other. Truth be told, James and I were pretty sure one of the deaf lesbians was a dude. But surprise, surprise, she was just a very short, very round, bald, deaf lesbian. Interesting thing, deaf lesbians are. We spent the evening with Sarah's friend and her new girlfriend. I barely remember the turn of events except that some chubby girl in a very tiny sweater tried telling me that Adaware was a virus scanner. Whatever.

Wednesday was relatively normal. James and I were fortunate enough to eat Chinese food for both lunch and dinner. It gave us something to be thankful for. Thanksgiving was interesting. James had the pleasure of meeting the entire family. My grumpy grandfather. My grandma who didn't wear hear teeth most of the day because her gums were hurting her. Nearly every annoying cousin I have. Etc. James fell into a turkey coma early in the afternoon and watched two and a half hours of A&amp;E documentaries with my grandpa. My grandma liked him. She likes anyone who will let her feed them. We went to my dad's in the evening. My father took great pleasure in kicking James's ass in chess, but James took great pleasure in kicking my ass in chess, so he deserved it. 

Friday was a hectic day of running around trying to figure out how to get my new car. The leg work required for transferring titles and getting license plates is simply exhausting.&nbsp; But who am I to complain? I got a new car. 2001 Chevy Impala. It's nice because all the windows work--which is much preferred over the one working back driver's side window in my old car. She drives so smoothly. I thought she stalled for a minute at a rest stop, but it's just that the engine is so quiet because it's not angry. I'm still trying to decide what to name her. I'm figuring it'll come to me eventually.

We drove back to school today. We both have way too much homework to do, so we're spending tomorrow deep in study mode. I'm hoping to escape the life of an academic for a bit to visit with Cristina and Cassie. I miss them."

"event","I've started about fifteen blog entries in the past week, but every one was too emo to actually post and retain my dignity. Alot of shit has gone down and I'm still reeling from it. But I'm doing better thanks to my terrific friends. I've decided that despite my penchant for picking the wrong boys, I'm pretty fucking awesome at picking friends. Despite our differences, despite our occasional arguments, despite the desperate acts of childish girls to fuck it all up, the great people in my life have been there for me everyday this week. I love them. 

I love James and Chantal for happily witnessing my emotastic break down in the middle of the night, at the river, in the rain. 
I love Brittany for going with me to the diner at 3 o'clock in the morning so I could smoke cloves and vent. 
I love Cristina for never tiring of me talking about myself. Man have I been self-centered lately.
I love Sarah for always making me laugh when all I want to do is cry.
I love Ed for offering to step up and defend my honor, even though I didn't need it.
I love my mom for giving me the ""No boy is worth it who doesn't appreciate how great you are"" speech.
I love Cassie Tolmer. Because it's impossible to be self-centered and depressed around an energetic five year old who sings Beauty and the Beast songs at the top of her lungs and kills everything that moves in Fable.
I love all of them for letting me be moody and listening to me whine uncontrollably--well except for Cassie. I didn't think she was ready to hear about my relationship problems.

Trying to quit smoking through all this has been surprisingly successful. That's not entirely true, but I have only had one cigarette a day since Thursday (with the exception of my 2 hour chain smoke-a-thon on Friday night.). Although I have been smoking about 3-5 cloves and flavored cigars a day, but that's nothing compared to the pack a day I was smoking. I'm cutting back on those too. It was way too hard going cold turkey. I would constantly be thinking about cigarettes and how little I cared about not getting cancer. But after having that hacking cough for the week before, I decided I wasn't okay with the possibility of getting emphysema. 

I almost forgot! I helped organize a protest that happened on Wednesday. SU Republicans sponsored pro-life speaker, Bay Buchanan (sister of Pat Buchanan) to come and speak. She had alot of inflammatory and unfounded comments about abortions leading to breast cancer, and she totally refuted all the points pro-choicers brought up during the q&amp;a. She was quite good at saying nothing at all, but making the Republicans in the room clap their asses off. At one point she asks a pro-choice girl what would be a good reason to have an abortion. The girl stumbled over her words and said something about rape and genetic birth defects. I wish Bay Buchanan had asked me. I would've responded confidently with, ""Because she wanted to."" I also really wanted to ask my question. I thought perhaps it wasn't one she could weasel out of as easily. ""You asked us to open our minds enough to realize that we might be pro-choice today, but after getting an abortion, we could decide years later that it was indeed a child. Would you we be okay with dealing with those consequences? So I ask you to have that same open mind. Who are you to say that in a few years you might decide that we're all right and it is just a fetus, a collection of tissue if you will, and you've spent your life's work trying to limit the rights of half the population? Would you be okay with that?"" I imagine her response would have been something along the lines of, ""I would gladly give up my rights if there's a chance I could be saving a life."" Which I would respond with something along the lines of giving up rights because of the moral and religious reasonings of right-wing fucktards is pushing America dangerously close to authoritarianism. But the dumb bitch quit taking questions before it was my turn. 

Oh! Let me not forget Bay Buchanan is also for abstinence only education. Because it's the parents' job to teach kids about sex. Not the school, and her teenage sons don't have sex. Oh really, Bay? I'm curious, what brand of chastity belt do you lock them up in?

It's nearly five a.m. I have no intentions of going to class in the morning, but I do want to sleep off this headache. I wish I could stop getting these headaches too. 

I feel good. I hope this weekend is better than last weekend."

"event","<i>I love you. And not, not in a friendly way, although I think we're great friends. And not in a misplaced affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm sure that's what you'll call it. I love you. Very, very simple, very truly. You are the epitome of everything I have ever looked for in another human being. And I know that you think of me as just a friend, and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option you would ever consider. But I had to say it. I just, I can't take this anymore. I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you. I can't, I can't look into your eyes without feeling that, that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are. And I know this will probably queer our friendship - no pun intended - but I had to say it, because I've never felt this way before, and I don't care. I like who I am because of it. And if bringing this to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me. But God, I just, I couldn't allow another day to go by without just getting it out there, regardless of the outcome, which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable shoot-down. And, you know, I'll accept that. But I know... I know that some part of you is hesitating for a moment, and if there is a moment of hesitation, then that means you feel something too. All I ask, please, is that you just, you just not dismiss that - and try to dwell in it for just ten seconds. Alyssa, there isn't another soul on this fucking planet who has ever made me half the person I am when I'm with you, and I would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau. Because it is there between you and me. You can't deny that. Even if, you know, even if we never talk again after tonight, please know that I'm forever changed because of who you are and what you've meant to me, which - while I do appreciate it - I'd never need a painting of birds bought at a diner to remind me of.<br /></i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Holden McNeil, Chasing Amy</b><i><br /></i><br />Nothing like a movie quote to epitomize my life.

"event","Sobriety just doesn't work for me. I get into too much trouble when I'm not confining myself to James's hookah room. 

Thursday night I was almost arrested. Even though I was almost hauled off to jail, it was a really great night of chillaxing and talking about our lives. We all grew up so differently and it's so interesting to hear their stories. We bonded alot that night--which is good, because now I know Chantal will have my back in the event that we're in a women's prison together and I'm all out of soap-on-a-rope. We went to Kidsgrove Playground and explored for a couple hours. As we were leaving, we are immediately pulled over by a very unfriendly cop. He took our IDs and ran them through the ""system,"" and after several weirdly anticipatory minutes, he returned to tell us he wasn't going to arrest us this time. ""I'm not going to find anything in there suspicious, am I?"" What do we look like? Drug Addicts? Exhibitionist Threesomers? Criminals? Anyway, he's sending notices of trespassing to our houses, (can't wait for my mom to get that) and threatened charges if we were ever caught in there again after dark. I knew we weren't suppose to be in there after dark, but I didn't think it was so harshly enforced. We go back to James's house and talk until five in the morning when we decided to have a sleepover. The three of us cuddled up in James's bed and harmonized our snoring. Sleep was sporadic for me. I never sleep well away from my bed.

Tonight seemed liked it'd be one of those wild crazy party nights. At one point there was seven people huddled around two hookahs in James's living room. We were smoking mango tobacco which tasted incredible. However, people scattered off, and by midnight it was just James, Chantal and I again. We went for a scenic walk to the river and stared up at the stars. I get really into nature sometimes. Despite having had no intoxicating substances, I became really sick to my stomach and end up throwing up on a tree on the way back to James's house. I'm a big believer that you know who your friends are and who you can trust by whether they watch you get sick. Alot of people would walk away or leave them alone if someone was barfing up white rice all over a Maple tree. However, Chantal was right there rubbing my back and James kept asking me, ""Are you okay, boss?"" I don't know why I am suddenly the boss. After hurling several times, I felt much better and spent some quality time with Listerine. The night continued on, and we enjoyed the rest of what Tom had left when he went back to NYC. A hazy hour later, John arrives, but we are already pooped. I just got back and, of course, I have this sudden burst of energy.

I think I'm going to spend some time with Orson Scott Card before bed."

Then James brings his katana outside. So the three of us took turns throwing water bottles at each other and then slicing them with the sword. I remember saying, ""If these were people, I'd be covered in blood."" As it was, I was completely soaked. So much for putting on make up and dressing nice for the day. It was definitely worth it though. I chilled with them for a bit, discussing romantic woes and watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Then Brit, John, Chantal, and Liz showed up, and we did that thing we do. I spent the evening in John's car listening to good music and smoking too many cigarettes. I love those kind of evenings.

My little sister moved into her new dorm today. Well, I guess that's not true. Her dorm is being remodeled so she's being put up in a fancy hotel until their place is ready. She's going to a 2 year technical school, so their first quarter starts tomorrow. Apparently her roommate is really nice and she met some friends. It's so strange that she's moving away to college. It's like she's a grown up. I guess that some of my friends at school are her age, so it shouldn't be so weird.

"event","I haven't posted in a long time. Mostly because I've been too busy and also because my life has turned into a series of moments that I'm too intoxicated to remember. Some of the memories are coming back to me slowly however. For instance, I recently recalled caressing my friends in seductive manners after a half bottle of Arbor Mist. And I also recall talking to Ed last night, but I cannot for the life of me remember what we spoke about.

I think I need to slow down.

Cristina has recently offered me the position of Cassandra Tolmer's bitch, aka her babysitter. That child can twist me around her little finger until I'll let her get away with anything. Case in point, allowing her to eat her chocolate ice cream cone before she had to eat her dinner. Cassie is five, and I take her to the cafeteria frequently. She loves it and always goes straight for the ice cream machine. Her standard meal is a hot dog, ice cream cone, and fortune cookie. I probably shouldn't let her eat such junk, but it's really hard to say no to someone so adorable. Apparently there were many people who were under the impression that I suddenly have a five year old daughter. Cassie and I have the same hair color and there may be a rumor going around campus that I have kids. Lovely. I don't really care. Most people don't know me and those who do should know otherwise.

Midterms is this week, and I'm entirely under-prepared. I should be studying for my two exams tomorrow, but instead I'm wasting time before I have to get Cassie off the bus at 3:30. I'll probably pull an all-nighter to compensate for my procrastination. 

I'm going home on Friday for break. I get to spend about five days with my family and then Sarah is off to college at Pittsburgh Technical Institute on the 17th. I'm really excited for her to get away from everything familiar. I think that essential for transitioning into your young adulthood. Otherwise you never really spread your wings at all. 

I didn't mean to make that sound like a Bette Midler song.

I've been hanging out with The James Kelley alot lately, and I heart that kid. James, John, and Jason keep me sane now that most of my core group of friends are the girliest of girls. I've learned to hate it less and be more patient when they want to do things like spin in the rain. I can politely say no and judge inwardly instead of announcing outwardly that such an idea is incredibly silly. Maybe a little girliness is what I need right now. Who knows?

Well, I'm going to shower and then study before D&amp;D. Who wants to make bets on whether Heather actually studies?"

"event","My birthday weekend was pretty fantastic. i made reservations for ten at Applebees for Saturday, but they were dumb mother fuckers who gave away our reservations to a party of 10 they thought was us. So we ended up having to split up the party into two tables. That really sucked, because I felt like I didn't get much time to hang with Chantal, Liz, Brian, and Nicole. But that wasn't so much a problem, because I spent a good portion of the evening with most of them. I got some amazing birthday gifts from my amazing friends. Brit, Chantal, and Liz bought me a trio of some fabulous board games. Apples to Apples, which was made famous at Amy's; Monopoly, a game I love, because I cheat my ass off and blame it on the game of capitalism; and Scategories, a game I am literally undefeated in. (There was that one time that Eric beat me in Scategories, because they didn't believe ""Nicholas Nickleby"" was a book. Fuck you guys, it was, and so I won.) Brady bought me a fantastic hookah--which I plan to utilize at James's house soon. And as lame as this is, I got some really meaningful cards from people for my birthday. My dad sent me a really sweet and heartfelt card about being proud of me, and my mom sent me a lovely one about how she cherishes our close mother-daughter connection. Marcie wrote a very nice note in her card about how I'm one of her best friends. Brittany's card was a perfect representation of one of the best parts of our friendship/roommategasm. They were all very nice. Brady also supplied me with my next week's worth of cigarettes, which was like saving my life, because I was running out. Cristina and James are now paying for me to become addicted to FFXI, which may or may not be the end of my good grades. 

My friends are fantastic. Nicole drove 45 minutes to come see me--leaving her baby and husband at home. Cristina ran over after working 9 hours. This is so fucking emo, but it really touches my heart that my friends made such an effort to be there for me. I love them for that.

Oh and to all those who bought me food and drinks at Applebees, you were fantastic.

After Applebee's, we went back to the room and drank some more (this is after my 2 Mango Martinis, a mudslide, and a strawberry banana daquiri). When the party started to break up, James fucking Kelly saved the day by inviting us to his house. We drank some more, laughed at our own inebriation, and smoked flavored tobacco from his homemade hookah. I heart James. Apparently we're all doing it again next weekend. Woot!

Sunday, on my actual birthday, I went over to Cristina's for the Heather and Cassie joint birthday celebration. The focus was more on Cassie, because her 5th birthday was far more epic than my 22nd. I bought her dollar store ninja and pirate costumes that barely fit her, but she really loved. I also got her a power rangers costume. This little girl loves power rangers and swords, but hates barbies and dolls. She reminds me so much of me as a child. 

Joel and Curtis couldn't visit because of Joel's sister and grandmother being in town unexpectedly. I was sad, but my birthday turned out pretty fucking awesome anyway. 

Now we're preparing for Brit's 21st birthday. I need to figure out what to get her. Maybe I'll get her some board games and we can be Board Game Central."

It started out with a drive to Bloomsburg to pick up James. We came back and picked up Cristina at work and went to Denny's for my birthday dinner #1. Yummy buffalo chicken strips. Then I let Cristina and James rekindle the romance after a week away from one another. So I picked up the <b>Hippy </b>and the <b>Republican </b>(unfortunately sans the <b>Sorority Girl</b>) and we went for a nice drive in which we passed public safety and almost shit our pants. We decided to hit up the diner for the Hippy's first time, and we had a very nice waitress. Aren't all the waitresses at the diner awesome? Wait, no, that&nbsp; lesbian one that kept hitting on me and Marcie was kinda creepy. I get back to the room and play some Flyff and watch some Nip/Tuck. As soon as I climb into bed at three in the morning, my phone rings. John and Jason are calling to wish me a happy birthday. They are drunk and incredibly sweet, so I didn't have the heart to tell them it wasn't quite my birthday yet. <br /><br />I had to work today, and I complained all day about having to work on my birthday.

I can, but won't be able to after I've had all three. <br /><br />And the best news of all? My dad didn't forget my birthday as I had originally thought. I find that to be good news."

I went out with Marcie and her cousin Jenny tonight and had quite the time, despite my creepy 40-something former EB Games boss watching my every move. I think he may have been checking out my friends, but that also might be my insecurities about going to a bar with two girls far more attractive than I.

I might also mention that the walk from Bots to Sassafras is brutal when you do it alone, drunk, w/o an ipod and with only your vitamin water to keep you entertained. 
 

I have also recently been very into Orson Scott Card's ""Ender's Game"" and the free online multiplayer game Flyff. Two things I have decide on a daily basis how to spend my time with. It's nice only having three classes. This means that homework doesn't really have to factor into the equation.

We still need to do some rearranging, but air conditioning, bugless bathrooms, and an all girl suite are things that Brittany and I fucking deserve. Normally an all girl suite would annoy me.

Our closet is fucking enormous, another thing Brittany and I deserve after sharing that horrific closet last year. Squeezing behind dressers and standing on desk chairs to reach our clothing was unbelievably annoying.

My first day on campus and, with the exception of Brittany, I have seen 3 people I recognize. Sarah Heath, Jalon Something Greek, and Meg Edmonds. It's ludicrous how many people on this campus I do not know or even recognize. I spent so long in a little bubble of my friends, that I pretty much know no one left here.&nbsp;

I visited Cristina yesterday and fell in love with her daughter. I think the feelings were mutual, even though Cassie wouldn't sit with me at Perkins. I told her before we left that I wasn't an adult, just a big kid. And so when we went to Perkins and the waitress asked how many, Cassie said, ""One big kid, one small kid, and two adults."" She's adorable. James and Cristina are moving me into totally dorkdom by getting me into D&amp;D soon. I'm suppose to recruit supercool people to play. I'm working on it.

Brittany and I had one of our famous late night girl talks last night. I missed that, and I feel like alot of my fears from the summer are being resolved already.&nbsp;

"event","Would you buy the horse if you could ride it for free? Just an overanalytical thought running through my head at the moment. One that makes me feel quite emo at the moment. So I'm going to attempt to update on the great past few weeks I've had in order to remind myself that even though shit happens, my life is pretty good right now.

Some amount of weeks ago, Ed and Eric came up to Cape Cod for a visit. I stocked up on booze for their arrival, which was about five thirty in the morning Saturday. We braved the early morning and headed to the beach for the sunrise. Unfortunately I did not think to take into effect where the sun rises, so we didn't get to see it over the ocean. Dumb Heather. We went home for a couple hours sleep and woke up late morning to go swimming in the lake. Eric and Ed decided to kayak, which I found mildly amusing. We then headed to the grocery store to plan our barbecue feast. We bought way too much food, but we were hungry. So whatever. We then spent some time in Seaweed Kingdom which is also known as the Mashpee Beach. We fell asleep on the beach, I turned into a radish, and then we returned home to grill up some burgers. That's when the drinking began, and by eleven I had thrown up on myself. I somehow ended up fully clothed in the shower with audience telling me to get out and to take off my throw up shirt. I had the presence of mind to not disrobe until I was in my room. I spent the rest of the night throwing up everything my stomach had to offer. Didn't miss the trash can once. Go me! The next day we had shrimp and steak skewers for lunch and made the hour drive to Chatham so Ed could see real waves. I got massacred by said waves; I still have the scars. On the way home we forgo our original plan to get good seafood and instead detoured in Yarmouth for mini golfing at Pirates Cove. Without a doubt the coolest mini-golf course. Even if Sarah and I did both hit our balls into the little river.&nbsp;

They left shortly after that, and Sarah and I began the incredibly stressful job of packing for our week-long West Virginian camping trip the next day. I got like four hours sleep before I had to drive the 12 hours back to Ohio to drop off my stuff before going on to Burnsville, WV. It was a great camp ground, and we were right on a lake. I swam like six hours a day four seven days. I felt so completely waterlogged. And let's not forget the night of Tragically Drunk Curtis. Sarah and I sat outside in the rain for 2 hours because my uncle didn't want someone puking in his camper. We were soaked. We finally dressed Curtis and got him inside and my incredibly religious grandmother started to pray for him by shaking his head violently. This made Curtis ill again, and he was literally thrown from the camper into a styrofoam cooler where he proceeded to throw up all the water I made him drink. We sat out in the rain for another fourty five minutes before he was safely inside and we were able to shower and change into dry clothes. Of course as soon as we're done it stops raining. The rest of the camping trip was uneventful. I bonded--on multiple levels--with Curtis and Joel the last week before I had to move away for college. I'm going to miss those guys. Joel is like the little brother I never had and Curtis and I had so much in common that he was awesome to be around. Not to mention Kat, Caroline, Ashley, Wes Penn,&nbsp;the drama twins, and Joel the Mole DDR champion of Massachusetts. That last one I honestly&nbsp;won't miss much. Oh yeah, and my Uncle Kevin and Kristy. Joel's mom Kristy is one of the most amazingly liberated and intelligent women I've ever met.&nbsp;

We've been back from WV for a few days, and we've been making up on lost time with Alyssa and Amber. I went to Badfrogs tonight to cheer on Amber in her karaoke contest. One piss tasting Busch made me ill and so I came home to chill. I dont like facebook much anymore. It mostly bears bad news. Don't you love it when your Stalker Feed on facebook tells you something you didn't really want to hear. Announcing one's relationship via facebook is a cruel way to tell the world.

"event","<p>I haven't updated in many moons because my computer is broken to the extreme. I've been fighting with fucking HP over the issue for about three weeks now. They refuse to replace the power supply in my laptop without wiping my harddrive. Their policy is to ""return the computer to it's original condition"" when it is being fixed during the warranty period. Fuck that shit. I have most of my computer backed up, but I've personalized my computer so much that it'll be so fucking irritating to get the harddrive erased. I may have found a loophole. I have an insurance plan through Office Max and they won't fix it while it's still under manufacturer's warranty, but they will fix it if it was broken due to accidental mishandling. So I told them a woeful story of how my computer was damaged during a move, so I think they're fixing it without erasing the harddrive. Although they said if they find that it wasn't accidentally damaged they'd return it unfixed. But I think they're bullshitting me on their ability to determine whether the computer was indeed mishandled.<br /><br />In other news, I was in a car accident yesterday. Driving home from work in torrental downpours made me quite the cautious driver. However, the eighteen year old girl behind me hydroplaned and rear ended me. My back is giving me alot of pain today, so my mom is insisting I go to the ER incase it was accident related.&nbsp;<br /><br />What else is new? Oh yeah, Eric, Ed and possibly Luke and Chelsea are visiting this weekend. As fun as it'll be, I wish the whole gang could be together again. I realize, sadly, that there is very little chance that all of us will be together again, but at least I have some of them there.&nbsp;<br /><br />I desperately miss alot of people I have very little chance of seeing for quite some time. I have already made plans in my head to visit Jon and Amy in Maryland. Maybe we'll finally get to Chipotle.<br /><br />I'm leaving Cape Cod to go camping in West Virginia next week and then immediately leaving Cape Cod to drive back home for a week, and then I'm back off to Susquehanna. I'm going to miss Kat, Curtis and Joel so much. Not to mention Kristie, Uncle Kevin, the drama twins, and the random other people who constantly make me laugh up here. I'm seriously considering moving back up here after I graduate. </p>"

"event","I look like a beet. And not the cool Beets like in the Doug cartoon, but a very ugly beet. The kind that is bright red and always in pain. So yeah, I got a sunburn. My sunburn, however, is nothing compared to the redness that was the lobster yesterday. Yes, I had lobster for the first time, and I was not impressed. I thought it tasted kinda slimey, so Brittany, who is allergic to lobster, ate most of my lobster while I waited to go to Wendy's later. I'm not a lobster fan, which irks me alot considering I paid about $30 for it. But I figured I had the money for once and I was in fucking Cape Cod! I would've much rather had 90 second rice.

New Heather Rule: Do not eat anything that still has eyes.

Brittany and Cassandra came up late on Friday 13th. We went over to where my uncle is camping to visit Joely and go for a late night swim in the lake (clothes on this time). We came back home late to discover that both Brit and Cassandra brought their laptops for a weekend visit. Fucking nerds. So we sat around on the computers for a while before hitting the hay somewhere in the vicinity of 4 a.m. Typical Brittany and Heather behavior.&nbsp; We woke up way later than expected and hit the beach where I received my spectacular sunburn. Brit and Cassandra were smart enough to lotion up, but I was too lazy to take the time. After taking turns getting clean, we grabbed seafood at a particularly unimpressive restaurant. Yes, yes, we should've listened to Joel and not gone to Cooke's. Last time I will ever say those words. 

Let me just say KATHY GRIFFIN is amazing. I love her. She didn't crack me up nearly as well as she did in Columbus, but she was still fucking funny. I want to be that woman's friend. Her Paris Hilton stories are hysterical. Many people may disagree, but I have a love for celebrity gossip. I don't know why, but I find it highly amusing. Nicole Richie's pregnancy is fucking hilarious. Lindsay Lohan doing coke off the bathroom floor of a nightclub almost made me pee my pants. It's dumbest/girliest thing about me. Get the fuck over it.

The girls are leaving today. Probably in like an hour, because Brittany expressed interest in leaving before 2. But they're still in their pajamas reading facebook."

"event","I love my job at the liquor store, because I'm always getting free stuff. Free margarita glasses. Free Jim Beam BBQ sauce, Not to mention all the alcohol they give me for free. The other day I went to the cash register with a six back of beer, a pint of whiskey, some mt. dew, and a pack of cigarettes. All I paid for was the six pack. It's pretty awesome. Plus all my co-workers are really nice people who are constantly making me laugh. Oh, and let me not forget that I was invited to a birthday party by an older black gentlemen who lives behind the strip club. Those kind of invitations make my job worth it. 

Speaking of alcohol, last night Sarah and I were determined to get drunk. We haven't partied since we got here, so we invited Curtis, Joel, and Kristina over for some alcohol. I pick up a couple Smirnoffs and beers for the kiddos, and one of my co-workers gives me a big bottle of wine for free because there was no label and we can't sell it without a label. I taught everyone how to play Kings Cup, and we all became suitably hammered. We go outside for a cigarette and come up with the brilliant plan of going swimming in the lake at 11 in our psuedo-inebriation. We realize that no one has swimsuits, so we just decide to go skinny dipping. Carrying nothing but our cigarettes and a citronella candle, we head to the lake and I'm the first one in, because the water just feels so damn good. Paranoia convinced us we were going to be caught when we saw passing car lights, but we did not get in trouble. We did, however, have five drunk people come back to my house, semi-wet and semi-dressed, to watch Saw 3. By this time, the water had sobered me up, so I watched the first few torture scenes and decided that it was time for me to go to bed.

Moral of the story: Go skinny dipping. It's juvenile and silly, but it's super fun.

P.S. Brittany and Cassandra are coming to visit this weekend and we're going to see Kathy frickin' Griffin!!! I'm pretty excited; I'm not gonna lie."

Then I warned him away from Tortilla Gold and told him it causes immediate gag reflexes in nearly every human being who hasn't drank gasoline before. He laughed, and then left.

One might think with something as official as a bank that they'd make sure they got my name right. How ridiculous is that?

"event","Here's a news flash for the folks at home: I'm a control freak. I do my best to not control people, but sometimes I am so frustrated by my lack of control in other people's decisions that it makes me want to punch a wall. <br /><br />The past few days my uncle took us camping with his girlfriend and her son Joel. Joel brought his super cool friend Curtis and the four of us had some fun doing illegal things in the campground playground. Camping Uncle Kevin style isn't for me. I like to camp, but a 36' motor home on a plot five feet from another person's 36' motor home doesn't ring true for me. Why sleep on a cramped pull out bed or take showers in a tiny camper shower when we can just go on trips to the woods and sleep in our homes? I like the sleeping in a tent or under the stars kind of camping. Although making smores and sitting around a campfire is some of the best fun a person can have. So it was totally worth it. <br /><br />My sister just informed me that I have a crooked big toe. Well she has Flinstone feet. Not to mention she's a fart terrorist. She likes to fart in small enclosed spaces and trap me there. She's very unkind. When we were sharing a bed during our camping trip, she farted under the blanket and then trapped me under there. Lesbians are gross.<br /><br />I started my new job at the liquor store and I enjoy it thoroughly. Alcoholics are funny. And wine <font size=""-1"">connoisseurs are even funnier. Also Stop and Shop is starting to suck less. Whenever my bagger is not mentally handicapped, the time goes so much quicker. I have someone to talk to who talks back, and I don't have to constantly remind them to continue bagging. Also an old lady came up to me today and told me I was adorable, which made my day. Because I am adorable. Then later another woman asked me what grade I was in, and was startled to find out I'm a senior in college. So I look like a child, so what?<br /><br />Sarah wants the computer. I'm going to go read before going to bed for work in the morning.<br /><br /><b>Monday</b><br />Liberty Liquors 11-7<br /><b>Tuesday</b><br />Stop and Shop 1-7<br /><b>Wednesday</b><br />First day off in 8 days </font>"

"event","I am currently offering free online classes entitled ""Handling Conflict Like an Adult."" I personally think Susquehanna needs to offer some sort of class in this, but they've dropped the gun. So here are a few handy tips until classes can be scheduled.

1. Think before you speak. Sure, you're mad. Everyone's been mad, but saying things intentionally hurtful or unbelievably stupid will not help solve the conflict.
2. There are certain venues that are not acceptable to argue over. Arguing via one's personal livejournal (which I have been guilty of) are not acceptable. Neither are any venues that charge, such as text messaging and long distance phone calls.
3. Lying does not solve anything.
4. When you ask someone to be honest, and their honesty hurts your feelings, who's fault is that?
5. Defriending people on facebook and myspace are some of the stupidest ways to vent your anger. Especially when you put your tail between your legs and refriend them a week later.
6. Intentionally trying to hurt people just because you're angry makes you a bad person. There are no exceptions. So if the main goal of your words is to hurt someone's feelings, you might want to change who you're letting yourself be.
7. See both sides of the argument. Even if you're right, you can't effectively argue your point without seeing the other's point of view.

This is all I have for now. Please feel free to add any advice on dealing with conflict like adult that you may have."

"event","Sure, I use my livejournal to vent about people who piss me off, because I really hate allowing my anger to hurt other people's feelings. Anger is temporary, and so instead of flipping out, I choose to vent. So, I'm going to do it again. And if you think this about you, perhaps it is. But really how egotistical are you to think my livejournal posts revolve around you?

People need to start acting like adults. Just because you're in a bad mood, something didn't go your way, etc. is not a reason to turn me into a villain. Not just me, everyone in your life. What is the point, other than constant aggravation, of having a friendship that turns on and off like a like switch? There is no point. I'm sick and tired of being someone's superhero one minute and a villain the next. Perhaps my comic book metaphor is a bit egotistical, but you know what I mean."

I don't want to be like this, but when it keeps happening, I feel like there's no other way to be. <br /><br />My hands smell like cigarettes. I guess that's what happens when you chain smoke on the back porch. Sarah and I sat outside and discussed how badly we wanted to meet people our own age. I love my uncle and I adore Joel and Kristy, but I need some friends.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also need to find a job. I quit Environment Massachusetts. My job was to walk around neighborhoods and knock on doors and ask people for money. They call this ""canvassing,"" but I hated <b>hated </b><i>hated </i>asking people for money. If people weren't rude, they were uninterested. Or the worst were the people who didn't believe global warming existed. I just wanted to hit those people. The point is that no one was giving me money, so I just felt like I was wasting my time making $7.50 an hour when I could easily have made much more than that working at Papa Johns or some shitty retail job. After the first day of cry-worthy pain, I started to enjoy the five mile hikes. No, honestly. It got me out in the sun and seeing parts the Cape that I hadn't seen. Yeah, that's right. I called it the Cape, as if I'm a townie. lol. Not to mention I had a tan for like the first time in my life.

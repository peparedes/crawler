"event","&nbsp;Annoyingly anxious tonight. What's new.&nbsp;

Had a mostly awesome weekend. Friday night I&nbsp;drank lots of wine with Cliff and Christine and played rockband (not very well after a bottle of wine). It was nice to sit around with friends and just talk. We all were probably a little to drunk for our own good, but it was thoroughly wonderful. Saturday night we went dancing. Jakes was a little lame and the dj wasn't great but dancing was awesome. Me and Christine seriously rocked it. I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;had forgotten how much I&nbsp;missed my friends. &nbsp;

Saturday was a little bit of a disaster. Went for a walk with my friend and her boyfriend. Problem is I&nbsp;really really can't stand him. Like he is everything I&nbsp;hate. The only thing that could make it worse is if he were a republican. Anyway, things were fine and I&nbsp;was being nice until he brought up a subject that really pisses me off. He was being seriously atagonistic. He could have just stopped at any point, so I&nbsp;don't think that this is really all my fault. But anyway. I&nbsp;lost my temper and went off on him. I&nbsp;literally told him how stupid he was, that I&nbsp;was smarter than him and that he was an idiot and should really stop speaking and listen to somebody more intelligent. Bitchy, but true actually, he is really ignorant and not all that bright. Anyway, after 10 minutes of yelling at him we went out seperate ways. I&nbsp;would have just stopped the whole thing and walked away but we were walking around the lake... not really anywhere to go.&nbsp;

Anyway, I&nbsp;don;t think she is talking to me. I&nbsp;did call and apologize... but i dunno. I&nbsp;am torn because on the one hand I&nbsp;actually believe everything I&nbsp;said, but on the other it was probably a little out of line for me to say it. But isn't it fair for me not to want him in my life? I&nbsp;love her but I&nbsp;don't like him, so why do I&nbsp;have to be around him. I'm just frustrated I&nbsp;guess. I&nbsp;have lost a lot of girlfriends lately. A lot of friends in general. And part of me is beginning to wonder if it really is 'cause I&nbsp;am a bitch. I&nbsp;always assumed it was because these people were unreasonable/immature/crazy. But what if it really is me?&nbsp;

Enough whining. Love to all of my friends who still speak to me :-)&nbsp;"

"event","So I am having a tattoo dilemma. I want to get a tattoo of the quote &quot;Don't Worry. Or worry but know that worrying is about as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.&quot; It is from my very favorite piece of writing, Wear Sunscreen, and of all the pieces I think this one means the most to me. No matter how many times somebody has told me &quot;what is the point of worrying?&quot; it never made a difference, mostly it just pissed me off. They clearly don't understand having an anxiety disorder. But this quote has always helped calm me down. I would love to have a tattoo of it, where i could just touch it, know it was there, and remember not to worry so much. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Details and Examples"">I want to put it on the inside of my left arm, but unfortunately my job doesn't allow it. I can't risk some future unknown job on a tattoo. We are not quite that accepting of tattoos yet, even in Seattle. So I decided to put it on my back, running down my spine. Sort of like this: <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i707.photobucket.com/albums/ww73/satinprincess87/2194236009_aaa25d38bb.jpg"" /><br /><br />I like the font, I don't want that font specifically but I don't want the text to look typed, but more personal and hand written. But my quote is quite a bit longer, so I am trying to figure out a good format. Keep in mind that I don't plan on sticking with this font, it is just the best that I could find on Word's limited selection. <br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://i707.photobucket.com/albums/ww73/satinprincess87/tattoo1-1.jpg"" />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://i707.photobucket.com/albums/ww73/satinprincess87/Tattoo2-1.jpg"" /></lj-cut><br /><br />I can't make up my mind, although I like number one a little better and chris likes number 2 better. Alright, enough tattoo obsessing, back to work in the hopes of going to bed before 2am. <br /><br />Adios!"

"event","I have decided that I need to begin getting my life in order so I started trying to clean my apartment. I also read all of my mail that I have been ignoring for a few months. Mostly medical stuff that I don't understand and can't afford to pay anyway. As far as I can tell, for one procedure I owe money to three different offices (all within UW med system). I used to have state insurance, and I just handed them my medical card and that was it. No bills, no statements, no paying things to every damn department I went to. Just went to the doctor. My insurance runs out at the end of the month. I can't really afford to get new health insurance but I am also really scared that this thing I have been having all of these useless tests for will turn out to be serious and that I will need the insurance. I think I will also have to start seeing a new psychiatrist... which will be expensive and annoying, because I like my current psychiatrist. I see her tomorrow so I guess we will talk about it then. 

Being an adult is a pain in the ass. I am constantly broke, I have to many things to pay for and it is ridiculous. It astounds me that some people don't have to worry about things like that. HOw is it that some people just never grow up? never grow out of the crap they did when they were young? I mean growing up is a pain, but my worst days are the ones where I ignore all of my grown up stuff and pretend it doesn't exist. How can people live like that? Sometimes the thoughtlessness and immaturity, the pure selfishness of others, completely astounds me. 

Things at home are good. Ferrets are adorable, Chris is as wonderful and sweet as always. He takes way better care of me than I have any right to deserve. I would say more but it is my bed time.

"event","It is really amazing what a day off can do for a person. Like an actual, no email, no phone calls, out of town sort of full day off. Until Saturday I hadn't had a day off in literally over a month. Not just working from home, I actually had to come in to the office every day. And I had pretty much turned into an emotional bitch. I feel slightly less crazy after a day off, although the 2 1/2 days I was promised would have been nicer. 

On my day off me and Chris went to the beach, which was a soooo nice. I had forgotten what it was like to be fun and relaxed and sweet. Poor Chris, I must be a bitch to put up with most the time. I wish I could be like that more often, and I handle the stress better than I used to, but working 7 days a week with 10-12 hour days is just wearing. Anyway I think I need to plan my life in a way that lets me spend more time at the beach, because honestly there is nothing so relaxing for me as sitting on the beach. It is hard to express how much I love it. Maybe it is from growing up in San Diego. 

Saturday evening Chris and I went to Cliff's for a much needed evening of wine, chatting, and video games. Just like old times and so very much fun. Although, as my tragically misspelled LJ entry demonstrated, I had an entire bottle of wine to myself. Really though, it was a totally fantastic day. And to Cliff, I have seriously missed you and we will have to do that more often :) 

In worky sort of news, our percentage of the vote keeps going up every day, so now we are within 6 points of or republican opponent. In a field of 4 democrats and 1 republican that is fucking amazing. We raised over 400K in the primary. This month alone we will have raised over 75K. So basically I rock. I am going to get a raise, although I don't know how much. Even a couple hundred would make a hell of a difference. We are also going to hire somebody else full time, so hopefully I will be able to take a day off here and there. 

Also I get saturday and sunday of labor day weekend off. Might even be able to fanangle Monday off as well. We shall see. 

So there... there is pretty much my life. The only other things I have to say involve long ramblings about the skill of various political consultants in Seattle, and I wont bore people with that. 

Oh, two more things. 

1) on our way to the beach we had to go through Hoquim. One one block was an incredably obese woman selling crispy cream donuts for some sort of fundraiser. On the next, this man steps out into the street with a fully drawn recumbant bow, which he is aiming at his house... Oh Aberdeen. *shudder* 

2) please oh please watch this horrible video. It is one of my opponent's adds. You have to watch it until the end to get the full creepy effect. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys6KrkAQVco

We went to the beach and I really love the beach. I didn't kill taras babt which is a plus to some people I suppose. And now I am at cliffs, wearing a tie and drinking wine.

"event","&nbsp;Another wave of debilitating anxiety the last day or so. Started last night around 6 or so and hasn't go away. I haven't eaten much because of it. I&nbsp;kinda bring it on myself. I wouldn't be so anxious if I&nbsp;kept up with my work and did my job the way that I&nbsp;should. But then my anxiety gets in the way of me doing my job right. Vicious circle. Complaining doesn't really help. But my god it hurts.&nbsp;

Chris is in Olympia for the weekend. It is weird having the apartment to myself. I&nbsp;have litterally never in my life lived alone. So being alone in the apartment is novel and not entirely unpleasant. But I&nbsp;do miss Chris and his hugs. On the other hand though, if he were here I&nbsp;would probably be a bitch, as I am wont to do when I&nbsp;am anxious, so maybe it is good I&nbsp;am by myself, since I&nbsp;am not fit company.&nbsp;

Now I&nbsp;am watching LA Ink which I&nbsp;adore although I&nbsp;think it has gotten to be more about the drama and less about the tattooing. But still an awesome show. I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;should put some pants on and go buy some wine. This is the kind of night where that is appropriate. And I&nbsp;have a fuck ton of work to do.&nbsp;

Sometimes, when I&nbsp;feel like this, I&nbsp;wish I&nbsp;could talk to somebody who would understand the exact way in which it hurts. The closest thing I&nbsp;can think of is a combination of stage fright and the utter, inescapable desolation of a major loss like breaking up, something like that. But that isn't really the way it feels, just the closest I&nbsp;can get.&nbsp;

Anyway, time for work and wine. Or more likely, wine and work"

"event","I think that from now on LJ is going to be somewhere where I&nbsp;record complete randomness rather than morose, self-pitying depth. Don't get me wrong, for all of you who like that, I&nbsp;am sure it will come up here and there. But here comes some randomness for today.&nbsp;

I&nbsp;have a love hate relationship with coffee. On the one hand, it makes me anxious and crazy. But on the other, this is the first time I&nbsp;have felt truely awake in about 5 days. I&nbsp;have been coming home and just passing out, in this scary kind of coma sleep where it is really hard to wake up and I&nbsp;can't think. And sleep seems like the most important thing in the whole world to me. And that sounds like a blood sugar problem. But I&nbsp;have been eating okay. So basically I&nbsp;need to eat better, and workout more. I probably have blood sugar issues because I&nbsp;grew up eating crap, weight to much, and my workout involves me walking up three flights of stairs to my office. Anyway, I&nbsp;like coffee

My boss is still out of town. I&nbsp;don't see her coming back anytime soon. Which means that we are all on our own... which had me really stressed this morning. Then I&nbsp;thought, fuck it, it is just a job, I&nbsp;will figure it the fuck out. Besides, at least my brother isn't unconscious in the ICU.&nbsp;

It is way to fucking hot, and there is no air conditioning in my office. There is air conditioning in the place where we do call time, so that almost makes up for me having to spend so much time here. The poor ferrets look really pitiful. Chris keeps dunking them in water to keep them cool, which they don't like much but at least it keeps them from heat stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;told Chris to go to his parents so he and the ferrets could stay cool until this heat wave was over, but he wont go because he says I&nbsp;don't know how to feed myself. Which may or may not be true.&nbsp;

23 days till the primary. 22 if you don't count today.&nbsp;

There was something else I&nbsp;wanted to say, but I&nbsp;can't think what it is, so I suppose that I&nbsp;wont. Getting back to work now. Hope all is well with everybody else."

"event","&nbsp;but instead I&nbsp;am going to spew random thoughts.<br /><br />I&nbsp;am both envious of people who can sit around all day and do nothing, and not. On the one hand I&nbsp;think it is crap that some people get to spend their day screwing around all the time. But on the other, I&nbsp;take a lot of pride in what I&nbsp;do and not doing anything would drive me crazy.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;have decided that a lot of people have children for the wrong reasons. If you are in a stable committed relationship and you are ready then that is one thing. I&nbsp;am now going to list the three worst reasons to have children:&nbsp;1) because you don't want to have to go to work anymore, 2) because you have nothing better to do, and 3) because you think it will somehow make you get you're shit together. &nbsp;My mom did the first, believe me it doesn't work out. The other two are a combination of selfish and just plain stupid.&nbsp;<br /><br />My job has gotten easier since I just committed to being here through november. My meds are working better so I&nbsp;am more mellow, at least a little. My boss is out of town again. I&nbsp;feel really bad, she called me this morning from a plane to tell me that her brother had broken his back in a car accident and she had to go to florida.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;am still deliberating on my next tattoo. I&nbsp;am thinking about the phrase &quot;Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is about as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.&quot;&nbsp;it is from Wear Sunscreen. I think it might be a little bit long... and don't know where to put it, but I&nbsp;was thinking on my left shoulder blade, same sort of place as my horse shoes... I dunno though, I&nbsp;don't want to overshadow the hoof prints. Still contemplating. Idea's appreciated.&nbsp;<br /><br />Only &nbsp;25 more days until this primary is over. 25 days and 20 fundraisers.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;miss riding my horse. My ferrets are adorable.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;think this is all of the thoughts I&nbsp;can get down on &quot;paper&quot; right now. There are plenty of deeper things that I&nbsp;could talk about but am actually doing some work, so they would be hard to get into.&nbsp;<br /><br />p.s. Paramore is absolutely terrible live. Like Avril Lavign if Avril Lavign sucked more. But No Doubt was absolutely amazing and awesome to see live. Chris buys good birthday presents. Appearntly my favorite highschool teacher was there, I am sad that I&nbsp;didnt run into him. Oh well.&nbsp;<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><br /><br />*edit*&nbsp;<br /><br />Just found this on texts from last night:&nbsp;<br /><span style=""font-size: small; "">(303): God I'm so bored.

No, that is wrong, I&nbsp;do care, in the sense that I&nbsp;am indescribably irritated.&nbsp;<br /><br />He was a celebrity. That's it. Get over it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;wonder how many cops died in the last week and a half. Or how many soldiers. How many firefighters. Or how many fathers and mothers and other great people.&nbsp;<br /><br />All of those things are more news worthy than Michael Jackson dying. But here is CNN playing an entire day of Michael Jackson. Let me list off a few headlines today that aren't making CNN:<br /><br />Obama Calls for New Relationship with Russia (washington post)<br /><br />New Protests in Western China after Deadly Clashes (NY Times)&nbsp;<br /><br />US loan defaults hit record level (BBC)<br /><br />And oh, that right, Robert McNamara died today.

Okay I wont lie, I prefer being a grownup... but it is still a pain in the ass. Funny thing is it is a little like I woke up and realized that I had better start living my life because college was over. I always said that I would ""do things"" or ""fix things"" later because I was in college and busy. Well I guess I can't keep making excuses forever. Time to fix shit and do shit.

Two Christmases. The ferrets. My friends. Family. Horses. The entire Norm Dicks campaign. If I didn't put it on facebook or LJ it is gone. And I haven't posted a lot of pictures because I have been busy. I know this might not seem like a big deal to some people, but I am extremely heartbroken about this.

I have been wearing heels for 12 hours and my feet hurt like crazy. There are an absurd number of hills in Seattle. I think my brother is moving to San Fransisco. I found this out through facebook, which made me think I should call my brother more often. So I called him to tell him that I am blaming him for all of my health problems because he stole all of my blood in the womb. This is because when I went to the UW medical center to have my kidney's ultrasounded and I explained to the doctor all of my various body defect (heart, kidneys,toes, thumbs), health problems (mental and physical), and the fact that my mom thought she was having two boys because the doctors only ever saw a boy, she told me that she thought maybe it had been a blood flow issue. The moral of this story is that it is all Casey's fault because he STOLE MY BLOOD!!!

"event","Well, I am officially 100% done with my bachelors degree in Poli Sci. I am going to be working as the part time campaign manager for two Seattle Port Commissioner candidates and I will keep doing some of the things I have been doing for Dow. I think that I am more or less subcontracted through Northwest Passage, the PR company I was working with. It is pretty cool because it will give me a wide breadth of experience with a little less stress. Then in June or so I may take a more permanent and specific position depending on what they need. Either way I will be making a little bit more money after then (I hope). 

Saturday morning I burnt the crap out of three inches of my pointer finger by dropping my 400 degree flat iron on it. So now I look all damaged and am trying not to mess with the blister. But my magic burn cream worked again, and while it looks horrible it doesn't hurt much at all. 

There is more drama in my life than I would really like lately. I am just so tired, and my life and health have been so exhausting lately that I am just not in the mood. Something is wrong with my kidneys and I was supposed to go have them looked at tomorrow but it turns out it is the wrong time of month so I have to cancel :(  I don't imagine it is going to be a very fun appointment. My blood sugar has been wonky, probably because of all of the sugar I have been eating. And my mental health is still rough, I don't know how well the medicine I am taking is working, although I am not up to the full dose yet. 

I have spent nearly the entire day watching America's Next Top Model. Nothing to fuck with your body image like 12 hours of size 0 models. On another, not entirely unrelated note, I have decided to start doing Bikram (hot) yoga. There is a studio right near my office so I think I am going to try and go in the mornings before work a few times a week. I think it would be really good for me both mentally and emotionally, and something about working out for 90 minutes in a 105 degree studio will make me feel really bad ass. If anybody wants to go with me, I like company :) 

Anyway, today has been a good day. I haven't had to put pants on yet today and that is always a good sign. I have written a lot, and for the first time in a while. I will try and update more in the future. Maybe while I am in boring meetings? But hello to all my friends on here. And also... I HAVE A JOB!!!"

I&nbsp;have always wanted to go see PBR so I&nbsp;am excited. I&nbsp;am excited to act like a cowgirl and listen to country music<br /><br />-Friday I&nbsp;am planning a girl trip to Neighbors as a birthday celebration<br /><br />And here is a cute story...<br /><br />When we first moved into our apartment, Chris' mom went to Costco and bought us like a 50lb bag of flour. No way in hell I&nbsp;will ever get through that. Two years later we are only about a third of the way through, and it doesn't fit in any of the cabinets, so i just sits on the floor. Last night we were sitting on the couch and heard a weird noise in the kitchen and Chris went to see what it was. This is what we found:&nbsp;<br /><br /><img width=""280"" height=""350"" alt="""" src=""http://i707.photobucket.com/albums/ww73/satinprincess87/P3080002-1.jpg"" /><br /><br />He was diving head first into the bag... you could just see his butt sticking out the top. He was sneezing a lot. It was very cute... very very cute.&nbsp;"

I&nbsp;am confident that this would cause the stock market to rally. Just sayin'.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;need to redesign my journal. I&nbsp;think the whole black thing is just a tad more depressing than is really necessary. So is my music, i have been trying to listen to happy music today but I&nbsp;am having a hard time finding any on my ipod. What I&nbsp;do have is mostly from the 50s and 60s.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have gotten a little more productive and so far have turned in all of my papers. That has been nice.<br /><br /> I&nbsp;saw a psychiatrist yesterday. She thought I&nbsp;might have some sort of cyclical mood disorder, essentially a depressive heavy, mild form of bipolar. She put me on a new medicine to compliment the Wellbutrin and Klonipin. It is called Lamictal and it is a mood stabilizer (and anti-seizure medication). Hopefully it will help though.&nbsp;<br /><br />Funny thing though, the new medicine has a very slight possible side effect of a fatal rash. Seriously. The warning just says &quot;possibility of a rash which may become fatal.&quot; So this medicine should really help me if I&nbsp;don't get a flesh eating rash and die. But hey, at least I&nbsp;wont have any seizures.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am at a really (good) weird spot right now. I&nbsp;literally have no idea what I&nbsp;am going to be doing after this quarter is over. But I have like 5 or 6 options and all of them are good. There is essentially no way for things not to go well. Generally I&nbsp;would be freaking out, because I&nbsp;am a planner and I&nbsp;need a plan damn it, I actually feel pretty okay. Although I&nbsp;guess I&nbsp;do have a plan, just instead of one I&nbsp;have six. I'm a dork.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;have also been getting back in touch with a good friend of mine lately. Me and Lillie have been best friends since the third grade. But we are the kind of best friends where we call each other that even though we rarely hang out or talk that much. But whenever we do we are still best friends. It has been really nice to see her more, since she lives like, less than 5 minutes from my apartment. Also I&nbsp;only learned how to spell minute correctly about a month ago. Spelling is for chumps.&nbsp;<br /><br />After re-reading this post I&nbsp;realize that it is an entirely random catalogue of &quot;shit I am thinking about right now&quot; and also that I&nbsp;wrote it horribly.

Also, you need to go back to high school if you can't figure out how capitalism is an example of hierarchical society. &nbsp;I have a certain lack of tolerance for stupid sorority girls named Candi, who clearly spent more time on this morning's outfit then they ever have on vocabulary, wasting my time. Anywho.&nbsp;<br /><br />Nichole and I&nbsp;went out this weekend. Highpoints: best/strongest long islands ever, like liquid candy. Nichole's awesome eyeshadow. Lowpoints: I got lost. A lot. And there was no french bread at safeway. It really was a lot of fun. I&nbsp;will try and post a couple of pictures later, but they are not on my computer right now and I&nbsp;am in class.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have been attending class WAY&nbsp;more often this quarter than, well, since like the 6th grade. Turns out class is a lot easier if you actually go. I&nbsp;don't know that this would have been true in high school, but in college if I&nbsp;attend class then I&nbsp;don't have to do the reading and I know what the professor actually cares about. And in the end, I&nbsp;suppose attending class is less time consuming than doing all of the reading. It also helps that all but one of my classes are really entertaining this year. Engaging lecturers really make all of the difference.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know many of you think that I&nbsp;should be paying attention in class, but you will feel differently when I&nbsp;tell you that we just spent five minutes of class watching Blue's Clues. A show which, I&nbsp;am ashamed to admit, I&nbsp;for some reason know a lot of the words and plot. Apparently somebody actually did research on this show. My classmates pointed out that all they know about the show is that &quot;Steve&quot;&nbsp;OD'ed, died, and had to be replaced. Oh college. Now we are watching Real World: Hollywood. It is about a violent alcoholic. And all of my classmates are laughing. I personally find it just scary... and oddly familiar and sad. It is actually making me really really sad.&nbsp;<br /><br />We just discussed this class in small groups... it is sad how many of the people sitting next to me in class are dealing with alcoholics. Anyway, it was a really sad but overwhelmingly STUPID clip... and now I need to take notes. I&nbsp;hope everybody enjoyed by hour long, running commentary of my effects of mass com class.&nbsp;<br type=""_moz"" />"

This is why you don't go buying stupid, ""baby coming soon"" picture frames when you have only been pregnant for a week. 

I am stressed over school, and at the same time not stressed. Anxious, but at the same time feeling more stable than I have in a long time. I feel like there has been a lot of drama... and at the same time I am separate from it. I don't know. 

So much confusion, why can't I make my mind up about people? Do I have to make my mind up about people? Do we ever really? I don't know. I wish people didn't have to get hurt. And I wish things didn't have to change. Especially not right now, especially not when I am just starting to get things together and get close to everybody. 

Also, anxiety disorders suck. 

I am frustrated and satisfied and seriously fucking conflicted. Confused. Conflicted... I don't know. 

I don't choose sides, I love you all. Confusing and complicated. I see each side of the story, and there are so many sides. And they are all valid and they are all invalid. I see the subtle ways that everybody hurts everybody else. And I want so badly to make it concrete, to settle it in my mind and make it MEAN something. Black and white. All these shades of grey are distracting. But I can't. I can't pick, I can't decided. Empathy. It's harder than you'd think, not hating anybody.

And the stupidest thing is, here I am bitching and my conflict/confusion/complication is hardly an echo of that which produces it."

We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation with evil. Yet the true measure of a people's strength is how they rise to master that moment when it does arrive. 44 people were killed a couple of hours ago at Kennison State University. Three swimmers from the men's team were killed and two others are in critical condition. When, after having heard the explosion from their practice facility, they ran into the fire to help get people out. Ran *in* to the fire. The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels tonight. They're our students and our teachers and our parents and our friends. The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels, but every time we think we have measured our capacity to meet a challenge, we look up and we're reminded that that capacity may well be limitless. This is a time for American heroes. We will do what is hard. We will achieve what is great. This is a time for American heroes and we reach for the stars.

"event","I have headed back into one of my ""I want a tattoo"" phases again. But  I really want a bigger piece than any of the things I have right now. The only place I can really think to put it would be along the side of my body, but I generally dislike that part of my body. So I have made a decision. I have struggled with losing weight for a long time (probably at least 7 or 8 years) and I probably need to loose about 30 pounds to be at a really healthy weight. Not to mention that I really need to eat better and work out more 'cause I feel crappy all the time. So I have decided to really dedicate my self to getting in shape, like really good, toned in shape. 

And as a reward, when I finally am in perfect shape, I will get a tattoo from my pelvis all the way up my side. I think I want to get the work I was considering for my ankle, only much bigger up my side. Vines and five flowers, one for my mom, my brother, chris, my grandma and my friends. And also a few buds to represent my pets. I am not sure, but I am thinking about doing it in a sort of henna, olivy brown color. I always thought that would be a really cool idea, that it would look somehow more organic. Although I worry, because I have never seen anybody with an all brown tattoo, ad I am beginning to wonder why. Has anybody seen a brown, henna colored tattoo before? 

Anyway, I am very excited about this idea, and I think it will help me keep in shape. Most people think this sounds stupid, but I believe that having that tattoo up my side as a mark of my accomplishment will remind me constantly how much work it took and to make sure to keep in shape. So, this is my plan. Yay! I give it about a year before I am able to be in this good of shape, but I am very excited."

There has been an insane amount of snow in Olympia and we are supposed to get more tomorrow. And while generally I am a fan of snow, this is worrying me somewhat because it might get in the way of my beloved christmas plans. And it is definitely getting in the way of me seeing my friends :( I am worried that the power is going to go out at Chris' parents house, cause if it does I dont think we will be going over there any time soon. All I am saying is we had damn well better have power and be able to drive to various family functions on Christmas.

Am I the only one who finds it somewhat ironic that I stress of snow ruining Christmas? well that is me, silly silly silly. 

I am supposed to be sleeping but I am not very sleepy. My mind is to active and i dont sleep well if Chris isn't with me. But my moms guest bed does have nice memory foam... nice nice memory foam. Memory foam may well be the best thing ever to happen to sleeping. 

I am absurdly excited for christmas. Like I am every year. I swear to god I love christmas like I am 5 or something. And wrapping paper. And I even love snow if I can stop worrying about it getting in the way of my plans. I just need to relax and enjoy it. 

Also, the next time I stop taking my wellbutrin somebody should hit me. Hard. 'Cause I am so much happier after just 4 days back on it. It is a little crazy. 

And I have a new internship lined up with this awesome democratic PR firm in Seattle which I am really excited about. They even give stipends. Not much, but hey, I thought I would be working for free. This might help me pay down my exorbitant Christmas credit card debit... maybe.

I feel like people think I am a lot better than I am, and I am constantly terrified of the day that everybody figures out who I really am. 

The last few days at work have been really rough. I fucked up some things big time. Not irreparable in anyway, but we lost a lot of time and I looked really stupid. I am only at the office part time, so i always feel like i am not pulling my weight and I never feel like I know what's going on. I am trying to learn a new computer program and organize all of these things and I am feeling like more than a little bit of a failure at the moment. I am trying so hard and I keep looking like an idiot. What I really need, besides school to end and to be mentally well, is to know that I am not the only one who has fucked up royally at work and looked like a total idiot. So if anybody has stories to that effect, please feel free to relate them. 

I am such a fucking mess. But hopefully it will get better after the next few weeks. Once I am at the office full time thinks should get a little less ridiculous.

In tacoma... which is a long fucking drive. But that doesn't matter 'cause I have a fancy title. And they are going to pay me, which is fantastic. It is going to be a ridiculous amount of work, 20-30 hours a week for the rest of the quarter, and 50-60 hours through the November election. And then I am going to sleep for the next month. So anyway, I am very excited, and tomorrow I get to go buy new clothes 'cause I have nothing to wear to work. Yay for new, important sounding jobs!!!

Also, here is my yearly rant on Cinco de Mayo. Let us all be clear, it is NOT Mexico's independence day. It is the day a battle was won, and it is only celebrated significantly in one state. It is a much more important holiday in the US. I love how Americans can think of any excuse to drink during the week. I guess it wouldn't annoy me so much if anybody actually knew what the holiday was. So I give you permission to celebrate it if you actually know what it is. 'Cause I know you were looking for my approval :)

Alright, I better go to bed so I can deal with all of my shit tomorrow. 'Night 'night."

"event","Yeah, I should be studying. But I just can't seem to get myself to do it. I am really really tired and just generally lacking in motivation of any sort. Oh well, I am sure I will do alright. I was doing alright, but on the drive back to Seattle I got to thinking about some rather unhappy things. 

A few years ago I very briefly dated/fooled around with a guy that lived next to me. It wasn't the crowning moment in my life. I was very lonely and insecure, and he liked me. At the time it was a rather intoxicating feeling. I let a lot of things happen that shouldn't have (which is a very bad habit of mine) and I have always found the experience rather upsetting (like a lot of my experiences with men). None of it was his fault, he is a nice enough guy, but it is something that I don't like to think about much. Anyway, it turns out that a few of my friends actually know the guy, and they have been teasing me a lot lately about it. I know they don't mean anything by it, but i am so rediculously sensitive, and there is no way for me to explain that the bad choice they are teasing me about is something that I actually find very upsetting. Point of this long paragraph being that I was feeling kind of upset once I was thinking about these things sober. And I needed to vent. 

On a happier note I had an awesome night saturday. There was lots of alcohol and awesome dancing. Jakes is a really neat place, and it was a new and exciting experience to dance without being molested or groped. Well, at least this time the only person groping me was a friend. Friend groping is much more entertaining than stranger groping. It was a really nice, fun night. Hopefully I will be able to go home again soon. And hopefully I will pass my test tomorow.... ah, whatever."

"event","Did you know that the Dalai Lama is in fact a CIA funded militant? Cause I sure didn't. I mean, anti-human rights and pro-violence I knew, but CIA funded militant? I had no idea. I suppose he really is a Dalai Liar. 

The crazy thing is, these are all things I found on signs at todays pro-China, anti-Dalai Lama student protest. I knew we had a large chinese population at this school, but protests? really? I think China is a lot like Fox News. They can say the most absurd, obviously untrue things and really really believe them. I mean, some things are opinion, but others are fact. And I am pretty sure it is a fact that the Dalai Lama is not a militant and Bush will never be credited with one histories most eloquent speeches. 

In other news, I got my new tattoo this weekend!!! I spent the weekend down in Oly, mostly riding horses and what not, and my mom went to tiki tattoo with me on Saturday. Of course, it was very sunny on Saturday, and I got a very bad sunburn on my right shoulder (where I was putting my tattoo). Nowhere else, just the shoulder. My life is amusing. Alright, maybe I will pay attention to my professor now. But remember, Dalai Lama = Evil   :)"

"event","Well I am slowly putting my life back together after a disastrous last quarter. Like really, truly disastrous. I am so very out of touch with the world, particularly the political world. I did manage to read 7 books over spring break. They were seven totally useless fantasy books but i choose to be impressed with myself. 

I really want to get a tattoo done soon. I still want one on my ankle which i will do with my brother, but i have also decided on another, smaller one. I want to get four little hoof prints, one for each of my horses that I have had. I decided to but it along my right shoulder blade. The shoulder will be easy to cover at work, but also the funny thing is that my right shoulder is the one that Gunner stepped on. I don't know why I like this idea so much, but that was an interesting time in my life, and taught me a lot more about myself and about horses. And also it was the impetus for my first conversation with Chris. So I am really excited about this and I want to do it as soon as possible. If anybody wants to get a tattoo with me in the next couple weeks, let me know :)

Now I have written way more about my tattoo than my wreck of a life. But thats alright, cause nobody really needs to hear about my slow attempts at getting my shit together. Wish me luck and get a tattoo with me!

P.S. I have a love hate relationship with intro classes. On the one hand I love how easy they are. On the other, I hate how worthless they are and I hate being in a classroom with 400 freshman... ugg"

"event","So I did a really stupid thing. I switched my antidepressant a few days ago because my doctor said it would be better for my anxiety. Problem is, I have finals in the week and the first week or two of a new antidepressant are riddled with side effects. This one seems to be making me completely exhausted all the time. AND the new antidepressants take a while to kick in. And the wellbutrin has worn off. Which means I am completely depressed and the fact that I can't get any school work done is making me more depressed. I have no motivation, all I want to do is sleep all day and watch tv and ignore school completely. Which is really bad. I fell really behind will what went on this quarter already and now I can't catch up. I feel like such a whiner and like I should just deal and do it. But I can't. It is so hard to explain. I haven't felt this depressed in a while. It is really hard. I will get back on the Wellbutrin but it still won't kick in until after finals. I need somebody to talk to... 

Alright, in better news, I have dental insurance for a month or two so I went to the dentist today and surprisingly they did all of the work I needed done in one visit. AND they finally figured out to give me Novocain without epinephrine (at least I think thats what it was) which gives me anxiety attacks, so while the drilling hurt like hell, it was otherwise one of my better dental experiences. Anyway, I better try to study. Ha."

Yesterday went better than expected. The drugs were really nice and made me very sleepy. And since the procedure I have felt pretty much fine. With my luck I was sure I was going to have the most terrible cramps ever, but I haven't really had any. Mostly I have felt pretty good. Just a little sleepy. I am sooooo very glad that this is all over. Yay for being able to eat!!!

Chris has been so very sweet lately. He took really good care of me this last week, making me food  and stuff. And he put up with all of my whining and crankiness. He really is the most wonderful boyfriend. I don't think I really deserve him, he is way to nice to me. He has just been such an angel this week. I love him. Happiness is nice. Even if I am really stressed out about missing the last week and a half of school. But thats okay cause my boyfriend is awesome and I can eat. Yay!"

"event","I feel so completely miserable. I would really like to stop being sick and anxious and worrying and all of that. This is quickly working towards being the most terrible week in recent memory. I just really want it all to be over, but at the same time,  I don't want tomorrow to get here because I am so worried. I guess I wont be worried when they give me the drugs. But that isn't until tomorrow. 

In less whiny, dramatic, cryptic news, I had a really good saturday. We kind of made an impromptu decision to go down to see Cliff and Nichole. Cliff made some fantastic sandwiches (I think the last thing I ate that I actually enjoyed) and there was good deal of tequila which I seriously needed. Everybody was really nice and made my night a lot better that I expected, I really had a great time. Later, Cliff, Chris and I played a lot of RockBand and Cliff and Chris sang :) chris does a mean B52's, it was actually the artist he did the best. I played the drums mostly and finally got passably good at that, and then Cliff forced me to play the bass which was actually good cause it is the only way I will ever learn it and I did figure it out and had a really good time with it. So now I can participate more fully in the RockBand fun because I can play almost all of the instruments. 

Me and chris actually drove back home that night, because we love our bed just that much and this is not the time I want to have to deal with his mother. But it was a really fun night and pretty much this weeks only redeeming quality. Although my mom did show up randomly yesterday and clean my apartment, which was nice if surprising. And all of my DSHS stuff went well and quickly. In fact, the only good thing coming from this whole experience is that I have super-health insurance for the next two months, including dental which is great. Now I know what do do when I need to see a dentist. I guess the idiocy of the federal government has its advantages after all. 

So i just have to make it through the week... and then the next three weeks of school that i have been putting off this week cause I am so stressed. But now I have written way to much and I think I will go take a nap. Wish me luck at the doctors tomorrow and I hope everybody is happy and healthy and stuff."

"event","I just found out that my mom might be moving to California in six weeks. And this totally sucks. My great-grandma can't stay in her assisted living home anymore and my mom (understandably) won't let her go to a nursing home, so she is most likely going to move down to San Diego to take care of her. I know this is important but I still wish it weren't happening.  My life with my family is just so fucking unstable. First, for the last year and a half I haven't had a house. Now my mom is probably moving to another state with all that is left of home for me. I know that it is silly and I have to grow up, but I really miss having a place that is really home. I'm really lucky to have Chris and his family, at least there isn't any real hardship, I always have a place to stay. I just really miss the security of having a real home. And I just moved back from DC, I was finally close to my mom and my horse and now she is leaving again after only a few months. 

I am ridiculously upset about my mom taking my horse with her. I know I don't ride him that much, but that is 'cause I am a little afraid of him. I still love him to death and I was so so excited about mom getting him trained again and starting to ride. I have missed riding so much and if mom moves it will be years before I can really get into it again. I will only see my horse once or twice a year and I won't be able to bring him back until I have a well paying job. And to top it all off I have been crazy anxious for the last few weeks for no identifiable reason. Maybe just PMS, I dunno. 

I did buy some really hot red lipstick at Sephora. I should never be allowed in Sephora because I want everything there and I totally dont have the money. Anyway, I should go shower and stuff. Sorry about all the whining.

"event","First, all my thoughts go out to eva tonight. She has waited such a long time and if anybody deserves new lungs it is her.

In less important news, the weather today was very pretty. Unfortunately my attempt to enjoy it by studying on the quad was interrupted when i was accosted by some sort of evangelical recruiter. Despite my declared atheism and obvious and intelligent lack of interest, she wouldn't go away. Suffice it to say that the phrase ""drunk on jesus"" was used more than once. Which led me to think that I need to make a drink and call it jesus. This drink will involve a combination of wine and a generous helping of crack. Anyway, I spent the rest of the day thinking up what I should have said to horrify her, I can't decide between hitting on her, asking about her pastors sexual prowess, or asking for directions to planned parenthood because I am late for my abortion. Thinking about this brought me enough joy to almost balance out their attempt to ruin the sunshine. 

I have been pretty worried about the fires in California. All of my family and friends seem to be safe for now, but some many places I have lived are burning. Even the hospital where I was born has been evacuated. I feel really bad for all of the people trying to evacuate horses. A lot of people are using their personal trailers to help, including my best friend, but there still aren't enough. The number of animals getting left behind is really tragic. 

Other than that, I have been crazy anxious today for no reason at all. I had an anxiety attack in the middle of the night. Who does that?!? Anyway, i have had to take a few lorazepam today and i am almost out. I need to talk the state into giving me health insurance so I can find a new psychiatrist really soon. It would be really bad if I ran out of lorazepam. So there is my day. I hope everybody is happy and healthy. Loves!"

I dont like the House. The senate knows what they are talking about, their republicans aren't all soulless. Explain to me how they can't approve something 70% of americans support, of whom 75% are willing to pay higher taxes to finance.

The less cool one is that i think i have the plague. The plague involves lots of coughing and headaches and misery. And I am being melodramatic of course. 

I don't think I am very good at cultivating political connections. The problem is that a lot of the poeple I know in politics are total assholes. So one the one hand I never want to speak with them ever again, but i have to be nice because I need them to write me recomendations. One of the guys I used to intern under is like this. I put up with him for a while. But tonight he insisted on going on and on about how me and chris will never work out, blah blah blah. I really wanted to to tell him that even if me and chris did break up i still would never ever ever have sex with him so he should really drop it. Instead I just signed off IM, so mabye he will still write me a recomendation. Fingers crossed.

"event","well, once again i am feeling crazy... though, since it has been a while since my last post, maybe the crazy days are becoming fewer and further between. I dont even know if that is proper phrasology, but hey whatever. I  hate feeling like this cause nothing is wrong. and i want to call chris but that isnt going to make anything better, it will take time and in the end it only works as a catalyst, making my anxiety come to a head and thereby ending it. I dont have time for that kind of catharsis right now... not until saturday morning once this paper is turned in. I never again want to write another word about unilateral disengagment from Gaza. I dont know what has been wrong with me. I think I will try and list emotions. I feel listless and antisocial. I want to lash out at people, i dont want to call chris for any good reason, i think i just want to pick a fight with him. I want to tell him that he shouldnt have gotten off of the phone with me to play WoW, but that isnt really fair. i had nothing to say and I have talked to him for at least 3 hours every night this week. And then he was all weird last night, which I guess sort of threw me for a loop, and then to have him not want to talk today, i dunno... it isnt really his fault, I am just stressed from finals and I think I am subconsciously looking for an outlet for that. What am I stressed about? I dont think I am stressed, I think I am having a little bit of an anxiety problem tonight... I feel petulant and childish, this feels like a chemical thing. Which is the worst, because there isnt anything to work out, just a general feeling of maliase.... so now I am sitting in kogan plaza at one in the morning journaling... it is all going to be alright. I am going to go home and get some sleep and relax. And then chris will come home for memorial day weekend, and i fully intend to spend the entire time wrapped up in his arms... i am sick of being crazy. the only thing that helps, is i think that everybody is crazy, more than we realize. At least, everybody feels crazy, even if they arent. I am so sick of hurting, and of other people hurting. I want to be able to fix things for people and I suck at it. All I know how to do is just be there for them and tell them that I love them, but I feel like that is lame, i dont feel like it is enough. It really isnt helping a ton that chris has been so unpredictable... it isnt really bad, nor is it his fault. I feel like it is him opening up and being more honest with me... which is great, we have gotten so close lately. I dont know, I am just rambling, my therapist mentioned that journaling is a good way to make yourself feel better. and I guess it is working. i am feeling a little bit better. To quote something I saw on nichole's myspace... ""the crazy, it hurts."" I actually feel it in my chest is the funny thing, the way that you feel before you go on stage or something. Think about existing in a purpetual state of stage fright. yeah, my life is a blast. I'll be alright. I just have to remember that. I guess if there is nothing wrong, there is nothing to agonize over. So I will be alright. I dont want to stop writing, i am scared, i dont know what is wrong with me... little cold to, probably should have brought a sweatshirt... alright. i think i will work on my paper more now. i almost hope nobody reads this stuff, though if you do, it will just give you an idea of a small part of what is going on in my mind tonight... which is probably not something you ever had a desire to know. Alright, going to work on my paper now, or maybe just listen to some music."

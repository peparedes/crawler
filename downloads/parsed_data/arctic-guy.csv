"event","I went out for the first ride of the season. My buddy Dan and I threw on our leathers and lids, and made our way out to Hungary Hill, which is about an hour of riding through a nice twisty mountain highway, and the hill is 5 km straight up over 2500 ft. The sun was nice and warm, the wind whipping through my face, feet up on the highway pegs. Stopped for a quick break, of course I forgot to haul my camera with me, I have to make sure to get it into my saddlebags. Anyways, on the way back, a stray sparrow managed to fly out and smack right into the bottom of my foot. Really, I felt bad for the sparrow. As we were nearing home, and the sun was sinking into Hudson Bay mountain, the bike started to sputter. I think to myself, ""crap, I just ran out of gas"", then remembered I filled it the day before, so then I thought to myself,"" uh oh, I'm not getiing the beast home tonight"". Pulled over to the side of the road, and called the Harley dealership on a lark, which was already closed BTW, and the owner Steve answered. His response? ""I'll be there in 10 minutes"" I have to say, with the exception of my bike breaking down on the side of the highway, my experience with HD has been nothing short of fantastic. They really know how to keep their customers happy. A 1/2 hour later, we had the bike loaded up onto the truck and back at the shop. Found out the starter went while I was riding, so the engine wasn't getting a spark. The part is being replaced for free, too. Like I said, Steve and his staff are fantastic. The only bad thing about it, aside from the time to get home, is that I probably won't be able to ride tomorrow. I guess there are worse things that could happen. Cheers."

This whole moving experience and stuff to do outside of the house keeps me away from the computer, which in my opinion is a good thing. Anyways, I just got back from Ottawa this past Monday, I had a course in Cornwall to take- Harassment in The Workplace, and our 2 day refresher which we are mandated by Transport Canada to do. The Harassment Workshop was good...however a little uncomfortable, since the expert that the company brought in to do it was the same person that was the 3rd party arbitratior for our harassment grievance against the manager up north. Made me wonder just how ""unbiased"" the report was. Unfortunate. The refresher was great. It was geared more towards active disscussions between the people instead of listening to a lecturer drone on about Traffic in the circuit. A good time. Got to see my bud Landmark and the boys, even got to do a 3F's. Don't ask if you don't know what I mean, I can't say. And I got to see the folks. We had a good chat, and seem to understand each other a little better. I don't have an extremely close relationship with  my Mother and Father, our interests are just polar opposites of each other. I love em' to pieces for everything that they have done and do for me, and I think we may have a new found respect for the way we lead our lives. 
    Back home now, and I am itching to ride. Going to get the plates for the bike this week, all the roads have been swept, and no more snow in the valley- which makes my AM walk that much more pleasant. All for now. Oh yeah...I need to get laid. Thought I would throw that in. Wasn't enough sex in this entry at all.  Cheers."

I've met hordes of people who are fantasticly awesome, and to top it all off, fishing season starts in a month and a bit. Does it get any better? 

   I think that the change to real world living was exactly what I needed. I wake up in the morning to go to work, and I look forward to it. I get to have a coffee from Timmy's every once in a while, amazing just how much you appreciate going to the store and paying 99 cents for a red onion instead of 8 bucks.

"event","The seemingly unending saga of The Union vs The Company continues. My boss has been flown by the Company to HQ for a Monday morning meeting with upper management, presumably to discuss his ""exit options"". However, in a final cry to bring everyone down with the sinking ship, my boss has effectively blocked my departure out of the Arctic, citing that given the fact that I took 3 weeks stress leave, I may not be ""fit to travel"", although he knew full well that I went on a mini holiday to destress. I took the issue to the mighty cog that is the Canadian Auto Workers a.k.a. The Union, and  they are stepping in on my behalf for a resolution. Ahhh Mr E, why can't you just let sleeping dogs lie, and go out with at least some shred of decency? Oh, that's right, you don't know what that word means. The funniest thing about this whole mess is that I just don't care. I'll get to Smithers when I get to Smithers. I may have to call the phone company to cancel the disconnect on my phone and internet though, no biggie as far as I am concerned.

Otherwise, life is somewhat hectic. Between cleaning up the house a wee bit before I go, packing-I tell ya, trying to figure out what to take for 2 months in a hotel is a bitch, cancelling cable, internet, phone, getting my insurance and plates for the new truck, spending some time with the cat, and the daily phone call to the lady(who is on midnights, so I have to get up at 4AM to chat, but always worth it, cuz she's awesome) and playing the occasional late night poker game(I've had to cut myself off with everything else I have to do), I' haven't had very much time to sit and relax. I have the movers coming this afternoon to do an estimate on the house-read figure out how many boxes they need to pack my stuff. 

Last, I wanted to thank everyone for the hospitality last week, especialy Insane Santa G and C for putting me up, and all the boys for thowing a spectacular I-weekend. It's really great to be able to recoonect with everybody-young and old. It was exactly what I needed. And to JD- It's been really awesome watching you grow up over the past 8 years. I'm going to miss you bud, and I wish you the best of luck in the land of Oz. If I am lucky, I'll come and visit, and we can have many tasty beverages.

My work filed a major grievance(go CAW!!) against my boss for too many things to mention. We had a 3rd party arbitrator come in from Toronto to mediate and hear both sides of the story. Things have got really nasty between the two factions, so much so that I cannot deal with it on a daily basis. I am on 3 weeks stress leave until a decision has been passed down. It really sucks that I have to leave Inuvik on such a sour note. I have very much enjoyed my 5 year adventure to the Arctic, but now I will also remember it as a low point in my career. 

We have had snow falling for 3 weeks straight. Currently...4 and a 1/2 feet...and still going. Shovelling 2 foot snow drifts off your front deck every day is not my idea of fun, especially since I was expecting to miss this part of the winter, as the snow really doesn't start to fall until December.

"event","Hello all. I haven't posted in forever. To summarize, after I got back from my last trip in April, I have had exactly 11 days off. Total. All summer. My  work has been short 4 people, and when you only have 9 people to begin with to cover 4-5 shifts during the summer months, running with 5 is hell. Every shift I have worked has had at least 2 hours of overtime built into it, and on average have also worked 2 full  overtime shifts on each rotation. Then add te worst summer weather I have seen up here. A grand total of 9 days of sunshine. Cloudy every single day. Some rain, some snow to remind me that I do live in the Arctic. And just to top it off, my desperately wanting to get out of the Arctic and knowing that I can't until we get some staff. Depressing? Definitely. Stressful? You bet. The only good part is that I now have an extra 220 hours of leave from working all the overtime. I'll probably take a payout on the time and put it towards a house downpayment when I leave, which looks like November now. 
    I am so looking forward to my trip. This is the worst I have felt being up here, and I NEED to unwind in a big way. So there will be a lot of nothing, and beers. Followed by more of nothing and beers somewhere else. Maybe some poker, some cottage action, did I mention beers? I won't have my cell on this trip for all of the people that have my #, my folks are RV'ing across the continent, and they have it. If you wnat to get a hold of me, I'm at Rob and Heather's pad while I am in town. See you this weekend!!! Cheers."

It does come in the uber cool government style secret document metal cases. All I need now is a set of metal handcuffs to complete the look (I don't think the fuzzy cuffs will look right) Anyways, for those that want me to haul them out, I'll try. I only get to lug 70 lbs on the plane, and it will significantly cut into my hauling power on the way back. If I can get away with taking them as carry-on, then I'll bring them. 

I also managed to finegle my way out of my last shift. Which means I won't be dogg-assed tired when I get on the plane on Sunday. Big props to my co-worker Chris for taking my shift. 

I've said it about 40 thousand times now, but I can't wait to get home to see everyone. Every time I come back to Inuvik, I realize just how much I miss my family and friends. I'm especially looking forward to seeing Matt, Denise, and Julia in TO. I haven't spent any time with them since just before their wedding back in May of 2003! Too long. Oh yeah, I also looking forward to taking Vario's money.

Anyways, for those of you don't don't read their email much, here's the skinny. Ocean's 12, Colliseum, the 21st(next Tuesday) 7:10PM showing. Montana's on Pinecrest after for suds and snacks(probably around 9:30) Hope y'all can make it! Shaping up to be a good time, with a lot of people! Cheers."

Ice crystals are a pretty cool phenomena. What it is is very tiny particles of ice suspended in the atmosphere, also known as Diamond Dust. In the Arctic, when the temperature is in the -20 to -35 range, they can get so large that they actually fall to the ground. Only place on earth that ice crystals do this. But when the temperature falls below -35 or so, there is not enough moisture left in the air for the ice crystals get any bigger and fall, so they stay suspended in the air. However, if you get a moisture source, say, car exhaust, or heat exhaust from various buildings and houses, then the ice crystals have something to adhere to, and ice fog is formed. When I got into town from work this evening, the fog was INSANE. I literally had to run the work truck on idle because i could not see all of the hood of the truck!!! No headlights, lamplights, nothing. I had to open the truck door and look at the ground to make sure I was still on the road. What is usually a mintue drive to my house turned into 30. From a weather standpoint, really cool. I dug it. Yes, I am a weather weenie. Comes with the job. From a safety standpoint though, I could of crapped my pants, I was so freaked out. I am so looking forward to -10 again! So all you Ottawa folk who are complaining about the uber crappy and cold weather the last few days, just one thing to say. BITE ME!!! I'll trade you any time you want.

I just don't get how Canadian airlines can possibly charge so much for airfare, and expect John Q public to pay a snot load of cash to fill their flights up. And the Industry wonders why they keep having the goverment bail them out time and time again. I can understand the fare to get to Edmonton from where I am- since 9 times out of 10 the flight down has at least 20 empty seats, as this is on a cargo conversion flight, which has only 45 seats to begin with. Even so, last year this time, I could go for 800, now it is back up to over 1100. If it wasn't for my work perks, I might not get home even once a year. Fuck you, Air Canada.

I hate that vile stuff. There is a really big sprinkler in here I don't like, but he seems to insist on turning it on every morning and getting wet. He seems to think that it makes him smell good, but why dosen't he just lick himself like any self respecting person would? I'll train him yet. I think I'll go and lie down until he's done in there. 

Well, you took long enough! Can't you see that I 'm hungry? Feed me dammit! NOW where are you going? Back into your room? ""Meow!"" In case you didn't know, that means I want to be fed now. Ok, now that you got your fur on, can we PLEASE go get some food. YES! He's on he's on his way downstairs! Now maybe he'll get off his ass and give me some food. Sure enough, first place he goes is straight to my bowl and fills it up. Yum. This new stuff is awesome! How bout a drink, buddy? Thanks! *Crunch.* Much better. I think I'll go bug him some more. He's at the computer now. I think I'll just sit right in front of him so he can't do whatever he is doing. That always annoys the crap out of him. But it amuses me to no end. ""Maggie! Why do you always have to sit right here! Stupid human. Do you not realize that every time I do this, you give me a kiss? Plus it gets you going. Better give a purr for good measure.*purr* Wait a sec! what's that! There's this arrow runnig around on the screen! MUST. CHASE. NOW. Where did it go? Crap. it's gone. Oh well, all this activity and I'm pooped. Better have a nap. 

""Bye Maggie! I love you! I'll be back soon, OK?"" Where are you going? Now who's going to give me a belly rub? I think I'll go have a nap on the stairs. *stretch* That's better. I'd better have a bath, so I look pretty when he gets home. *CAW!!!* What's that? Better go check it out. Up the stairs into my room with my big box by the window. FOOD!!! That bird is HUGE!!! Maybe I can trick it into coming over her by the window. ""MEEP! MEEP!"" Nope, not working. I really got to work on my evil psychic powers, Mine just don't cut it. It is draining though, I think I'll just plop on these nice extra furs he has lying around and take another nap. That's the stuff. A little face wash before I dose off. Can't look too good, you know?

The truck is here! He's back. Better make it look like I've been waiting for him the whole time. I race down the stairs and sit right by the door. ""Hi Maggie!"", he exclaims, and picks me up for a snuggle. *purr*. Hurry up and sit down on the couch so I can get my chin scratched. That's the shit. Oh man, keep it coming.*PURR* I think I'll sit here for a second, he seems to like that. (About 30 seconds passes) Alright, that's enough, I'm gonna go now and have some more food, and then perch myself on my couch pillow by the window. I found out a while back that I can take the window screen right off without any effort at all. If I ever need to fly the coop, my escape route is all planned. The only problem is that he never opens the outside part. Maybe he is smarter than he looks....who am I kidding! What a dolt! 

Looks like it's bedtime. He is turning out all of the lights downstairs. Yup, he's going upstairs. I always give him a headstart, then beat him up the stairs. One of these days I might let him win. He's back on the weird chair, then he takes his fur off, he has his own special ""sleeping fur"" that I love to curl up on, it's so soft and fluffy. Often, when he is away, or in the afternoon when I want to have a quality nap, I'll go and curl up in his spot, I think it is better than mine. Ok he's settled in now, so I jump up on his fur, within reaching distance, since I know I'll get another good scrathing session before bed. *purr* ""I love you Maggie"", he says, gives me a kiss, and turns out the light. I stand up, and give his hand a couple of headbutts for the hell of it. Then I move about halfway down the bed so his arms don't flail me off the bed, and lie down until he's asleep, then I go to the top stair for a while, maybe play a little, then back to his room for the night. I like to sleep at the top of his head, sinc ehe has no fur up there, and I think he might get cold. Goodnight, my butler. 

(Human's Note: The funniest noise you will ever hear from a cat is when Maggie is ""barking"" at a big ol' Raven outside. If you can't tell, I love her to death, and she has me well trained to do her bidding. Cheers)"

"event","There is something funky in the fridge. You open the door, and you get funk. Now I have no idea what it is, since my fridge these day has only vegetables, which are always replaced every 4 or 5 days, some beer and whatever I cook and portion out for the week. Oh yeah, a carton or two of eggs. That's it. There is nothing else there. Weird. So, now that I am off midnights *YAY!* I will bring the thunder to the funk. FUNK BEGONE!
As I have a few days off, I have shit to do. Groceries, Laundry, THE FRIDGE, the downstairs bathroom, vaccuuming, and installing a new block heater ino the truck. As well, I am going to see about trading in my baby for a new sled. Although  don't really NEED a new snowmobile, mine is almost 4 years old now, and I can get a good price for it, as well as upgrade to a real monster. For those that do sled, I am checking out the new 900 RMK 169"". It's a beast. There is nothing on powder that can touch it. And I mean nothing. I had the inane pleasure of testing this guy out last winter when Polaris was up doing their cold weather testing on their 05 lineup. Oh. My. God. Insanity on 2 skis. You pretend to touch the throttle, and it's out of the hole faster than bad dirarrhea. It floats on top of 6 ft powder at 20kph! This is unheard of on a typical mountain sled. I guess you can say that I love it. The only reservation I have is that it is on a new chassis this year, and as a rule, you should not buy a 1st year production sled. There are ususally some bugs still to work out. Anyways, I do have to go out and buy some diapers for Tanya new baby. She is due just around Christmas, and every payday I go out and get a bag or two of diapers for her. My Christmas gift. I've been doing this since July, and so far, I have somewhere around 20 bags of diaper, some clothes, shampoo, pacifiers, rattles, baby powder, some wet wipes, and a baby backpack. By Christmas, I hope to have enough diapers to get Mike and Tanya through to 20lbs of baby. I hope. I know they will appreciate it, because  I know that no one else is doing this. 
On another note, I'm looking for a dog. I've decided that I would like to have a canine companion around, and have been doing some research for quite a while. I've decided on getting either a Lab or a Golden retriever, and have a couple of appointments to visit potential breeders when I am in Ottawa over Christmas. I don't think I will get a new pup while I am in Inuvik, but I fully expect to get out of here by the summer, so the new additiion to my family will wait unrtil I buy a house. Cheers."

Learning how to replace a thermostat on my truck and replace my block heater and install a battery blanket and flood lights has actually been fun. I've built storage shelves for my storage room and completely rebuilt a snowmobile trailer. Its kinda cool trying somewhat futilly to be a gearhead!

That being said, my sled is now ready for winter. I tested the compression today, made some adjustments to that and the suspension, gave er' a good cleaning, and got her started up.Man, do I love the growl of a piped out sled. I took her for a quick spin around the driveway and up the block to check the work I did, and all seems in order. My first official ride was October 23rd last year, and it looks like it may be earlier this year. Brilliant.

If I'm really lucky, it'll mean a fine supper of Coney(fish), but I haven't caught any coney all year. 

Last night I decided to see just what in my closet fits me again. Well, the first thing  I did was throw out two pairs of pants. THEY WERE TOO BIG. That's just cool. Then I added 7 old pairs of pants back into my closet, including 2 pairs I have never been able to wear(WTF!!!)  All of my old shirts from the early 90's fit again, but there are a few that will have to wait a couple of more months. What both scares and excites me is that soon, I guessing by next spring, I am going to have to shell out some major cash for new clothes. Scared about the $$$, I have always had expensive taste, but excited that I will after all of these years be able to walk into a store- any store and find clothes that fit.

I still have to drill them out, and it took me a good jaunt to the hardware stores in town looking a deer caught in the headlights as I tried to figure out which drill bit could punch through 22 guage stainless steel with ease ( I did say that I was mechanically inept, didn't I? ). After much general confusion on my part, I got the bit, and drilled the holes. I even did a decent job of it, too. Then a coat of aluminum rust paint to match the rest of the trailer, and all that's left is to actually mount those bad boys. Voila! One completed skidoo trailer. 

On another note, this weekend I am a leadership course for Scouting. Sucks that I cannot really do anything like go out, but cool because I have been asking for training for over 3 years. I have one more 1/2 day of training, then I can cool out with some football and monster rib action. Maybe even a beer for good measure. Gotta love Sundays. I will probably head out into the bush on Monday/Tuesday, for some paddleing, fishing, and camping. Cheers."

The rust removal and the painting was pretty easy-busy work, which passed away my last set of days of quite conviently. I had to get two new wheel fenders fabricated, which were supposed to be ready last Friday. Still not done. Bunch of incompetent boobs. The lot of em' . Even I in my mechanical ineptitude could have bent a few pieces of 22 gauge sheet metal into something respectable by now. If they are not done by tomorrow when I finish work in the morning (I'm currently on my last midnight) I am taking by business elsewhere, namely up to my buddy's workshop. Should have just done them myself in the first place, I guess. Anyways, then I go to hitch up the trailer to test out my wiring job, and the lock for the ball hitch(and no, I'm not talking about a woman), the lock for the receiver breaks off in my hand. Oh, and the wiring isn't right, either. I suck when it comes to trying to be a gearhead. At least I try. I have 4 more days off as of 7:30 Friday morning, so I'll get cracking on fixing my screwups.

I keep reading about and talking with all of the fun things my friends are doing, and I really want to be part of it again. Plus, my parents are both now in their late 60's/early 70's, and I know that I don't have very many years to spend with them. Being up here really makes me appreciate what I do have back home. I think that my last trip out really pulled hard on my heartstrings. On that note, I have a few things I'd like to say.

Mom and Dad. I know that you will never read this, but thank-you for absolutely everything. You have shown me that sometimes the hard way is better, and that unconditional love is the most wonderful thing that a human being can experience. I love you more with every passing day, and hope we still have a good many years left. Leave the light on, Mom, I'm coming home soon.

Rob- My best bud. I don't know if you realize just how much I look up to you. In my eyes you have it all- Strong family ties, A wonderful wife, confidence, and you know just what you want out of life and how to get it. You have always been there for me, even when the chips were down. thanks for being such an inspiration and such a great friend.

LT- Back in a parking lot outside of Grand Central, we had a conversation, and although it was not very pleasant, you said something to me on that cold Autumn night that I took to heart, and is the reason that I came back. There is not a day that goes by that I don't think about those words, and just what they mean. Those words were, ""No matter what happens, you will always be my Brother."" It says it all. Thank you so much, it is THE reason why I understand what my Bond means.

JD- I have seen you  grow so much in the past few years. Your zest for life is your driving force. You just make everyone around you happier. Never lose that. It is my honor and my privilege to be your friend.

Matt- You will also probably never read this, but it still has to be said. We have some very deep and meaningful conversations, life, love, philosophy, values and nothing in general. You are the most loyal and loving person I know. You relationship with your Family is bar none the closest I have ever seen. You wife and daughter are perhaps two of the luckiest people on earth. You are the ultimate teacher, and you have taught me so much about personal relationships and human emotions. 

Acton and Evi- I am so happy to see the two of you develop into a strong, mature couple. Hurry up and get married, Dammit!!!

There are so many others I want to say thanks to, or who have been an impact on my life, but it would be a VERY long post. So they go into my personal journal. I just have one more person to thank...

To me- P, the last 10 years have seen you go from the naive little punk to who you are now, a man who knows that being upfront and honest is a much better way to live than being deceitful. that people do accept you for the way that you are, and that you have so much to share and give to the people in your life. You are generous almost to a fault, and have learned that Family and Friends are the most important values. No matter where you are in life, or what you do, there are people that will ALWAYS be there. The path that you have chosen for yourself was, and is hard, but it is the right one. If you could do it all over again, in a heartbeat, yes. Your choices, good and bad, have made you who you are. ""No matter what, YOU will ALWAYS be a Brother to me."" Cheers."

    Hello all. Well, summer is over (fall for thhat matter up here too!). It's cold, and I want my fall back. Anyways, just what is going on with me? Summer was great. I've managed to fish, camp, hike, BBQ, or something outdoorsy pretty much every single day off I had. One of my best friends got hitched, and I got to see a bunch of people and talk to a few on a level that I thought I wouldn't be able to again for certain events that occured in the past. (Thanks, D, it means a lot.) Iv'e had the past 5 days off, and did the following- replaced the thermostat on my truck, changed the oil on my truck and my snowmobiles, and overhauled a skidoo trailer-removed all the rust top and bottom, painted and rewired. I also built a set of shelves in the storage room. Now, I am NOT a handyman, but I didn't realize that I could do some of these things. On top of that, I enjoyed all of the busy work. Makes one feel accomplished. Anyways, on Friday evening, Mike, my buddy who helped me out with the thermostat decided to kick back and share a little rum to reward our efforts. After we manged to sink a 40 of the stuff in just over 2 hours, Mike's girl decided it would be a good time to do a couple of shots of peach schnapps. Just wrong. It took me a 1/2 hour to get home, home being 2 doors over in the same set of rowhouses! Another 1/2 hour to get upstairs and into bed, where I prompty passed out for many hours. The next morning brought the phase ""STOP THE WORLD!!!! I WANT TO GET OFF!!!"" So the moral of the story? Say no to peach schnapps. (well, at least after 20 ounces of rum, anyways.) 

    For those in the big O, I'll be in town for a pre deep freeze blitz of fun and debauchery in October (the 15th I believe). 

Cheers."

My life pretty much can be summed up in one word...outdoors. Almost every second I have is spent on exploring this beautiful landscape I live in, whether it is on a snowmobile in May (that's right, May!), or now fishing the creeks and lakes dowm the 800km gravel highway that is the Dempster Highway. I've seen so much in the last few months, and I'm loving it. 
The downside? My back is hurting again. It started about a month ago, and for those that know what I have gone through in the past few years, I'm a little worried about it. Usually I'll get a little pain for a few weeks, then it will go away. I know how to keep care of my back, and I do, still have to do some physio in the way of strength and stretching exercises. But nothing is helping it right now. I hope the pain goes away soon, I really don't want to go through this again. 
My Mom and Dad are coming to visit me in July! I'm giddy. It's the first time that anyone has come up to see me here, and I can't wait. Except for the mass scourging of my house that will have to be done. I've already started. with the mass spring laundry loads. I'm going to take them to Dawson City for a couple of days, and out for a picnic at one of favorite places- Caribou Creek. 
Last, I will be in the big O to see two of favorite people get hitched. I'm there from the 13th to the 21st(ish). A little dose of civilization and horrible sticky July weather. Yay!!! Some serious movie action and a late night snack or two does a body good. Perhaps even a trip to the big smoke to see the big Scot and his two littler ladies. I'm really looking forward to this trip to see all of my buds. The only thing I don't like about being here is all of my friends back home couldn't come too. 
Well, that's all for me for now. I'm going to go back to that wall and listen for a while longer. Cheers all.

I leave on Christmas Eve, and am spending Christmas in a hotel(sucks). I wanted to leave on Boxing Day, but there isn't a flight running that day. Off to Vegas on the 27th, then home on the 4th. I am very much looking forward to seeing my family and my friends. In Ottawa until the 19th, then off to Cornwall for a week and a bit for 3 courses. I'll still be able to do stuff in Ottawa while I am on course. 

I have pretty much spent the last month outside on my snowmobile. Every chance that I can get, I am exploring the Mackenzie Delta. JUst to give an idea of the size of the Delta, I have not had to follow the same tracks on it yet. I am really starting to believe that this is one of the most pristine wilderness areas in the world. There is nothing like running down a trail following a herd of caribou, or seeing a lone arctic wolf running across the ice(kind of scary too!). This has been a great winter so far, and it will only get better. By the time I get back, all of the channels in the Delta will be safe to ride, so I can pretty much go anywhere. On top of that, there will be a lot more sunlight to ride, as right now I am quite competent riding in the night. By the time mid March hits, there will be sunshine from 6:30 in the morning till almost 10:00 at night, and a good month and a half of riding still to go.

As for the rest of life, I am having a little Christmas on the 23rd for the girls. I've spoiled them rotten with gifts, but I had to do it, it got me into the season, and since they are not expectig it, all the better. I really don't know what I would do without them, they all keep me sane. Anyways, it's time to get ready for work, so that's all I'll say for now. Cheers."

"event","I finally got my frozen up snowmobile to start. Hooray!!! I went up old Navy road and along the gas pipeline trail for about an hour, and came back. Total mileage- 140km. Incidentally, that is 1 full tank of gas. Filled up on the way home, and got back in time to watch the hockey game. For those that missed it, watching Gretszky, Messier, Kurri, Semenko, and Coffey all on the ice together again was special. Now, I am not an Oilers fan, but when you see that line play, especially in the early 80's, you have to recognize that particular group as one of the greatest lines in the history of the NHL. For the boys who are away doing their ""kung-fu fighting"", I hope one of you taped it. 
   As for myself, I am having the guys over to play poker tonight. There are four of us who try and get together about once a month to play, but its been about two since we have. It will probably be the last time that I will get a chance to play before my trip to Vegas over Christmas. 
  Speaking of Vegas, I am really getting excited about it. The first night there, we are going to see Jerry Seinfeld. Sweet!!! I still don't know how we managed to get tickets. We are also seeing Penn and Teller. Other than that, there will be a little golf, some clothes shopping, good eats, a little Ferrari driving(I can feel <lj user=""vario24""> drooling already), and, of course a buttload of poker. New Year's Eve will be spent on Freemont Street. 
   Other than that, personal life is pretty decent. My little town only gets about 5 hours of daylight, and we lose almost 20 minutes a day, now. I usually get into a bit of a funk at this time of year, just due to the lack of daylight, and knowing I have another month and a half or so of it, but its not so bad this time  around. I think it is due to me knowing that I have only until Christmas Eve, and then I am gone for five weeks, so when I return, we will have days like now, except we will be gaining sunlight, and not losing it. All for now. 

P.S. If any new Tau Omega Tekes read this post, my heartfelt congratulations go to you. Welcome to the Magnificent Obsession. For my Fraters that pulled off the Weekend, you probably don't hear it enough, but keep up the good work. Cheers"

    The next night was the Ducks Unlimited Ball on Saturday. They served a fantastic roast beef dinner. It was unfortunate that the red wine was so poor, but most didn't care, since it was free. After the 4th glass, neither did I. Ducks also has an auction after the dinner, once everyone is a little sauced and are a little more carefree with their money, so that the items go for more. I tried to bid on another wolf print this year, which had a pair of wolves on a rock with the northern lights shimmering in the background. It went for $800. I didn't realize it, but I was bidding against my friend Jeannie in the back. Had either of us realized, one of us could have had it for about 100 bucks less, I figure. Oh well. I ended up going home around 11:30, I had to work the next morning. 
    4 days of work and one night off, we make it to Thursday evening past. Just a normal night. I decide to go out to the Finto to be social and have a coffe e or two. For some strange reason, I get a ride with Smitty and Jen over, which I never do, I always take my own vehicle. I get there, and have coffee and Bailey's because I don't have to drive. After two coffee, I switch to rye, and its game over. I pour myself into at 2:30, and wonder why the world is spinning around my bed. 
   My last night of tainting the shrine was Saturday. Newfie night. All of the Newfoundlander's in town get together for a big scoff (dinner), have a few drinks, and jig the night away. The hight of the evening is hauling a bunch of mainlanders on the stage, and watching them get ""screeched in"" which is a ceremony to make people honorary Newfies. First, we make them eat Newfie food, which was Newfie steak(bologna) and hard tack(bread), then we make them say some newfie stuff, I believe it was, ""Hey buddy!! Has eider jit pitched ere yet today or what!"", which means has the plane arrived? Aftre that, they stand in some water from the Atlantic Ocean, have a shot of Newfie Screech(which is 151 proof Jamacian Rum), and then kiss a cod, then say the words, ""Long may your big jib draw!"" You get a certificate to prove you have been screeched in and are an honorary Newfie, and everyone gets pissed. I haven't been been that loaded since I was a frosh in university. 
    I am chalking up the last two weeks as an extension of my birthday. I am of the impression that the older you get, the longer you need to celebrate that you are still alive, and not so much that you are officially a year older. That's my theory, and I am sticking to it. Cheers."

"event","Well, I managed to make it to my last midnight shift. I have three glorious days off to celebrate getting another year older. The girls have decided that I am going have a party, and are going to cook me dinner. Now, I have no problem with this, although I am a little scared. The last time I got porkchops with Kraft singles melted on the top, very burnt scalloped potatoes, and limp broccoli. Four girls in a house, no culinary skill to save the lot of them!!! Which is the reason that I am the one that has all the dinner parties! I'm not complaining, though, don't get me wrong. I love the fact that they are going to try to cook for me. Besides, if you wash it down with enough wine, anything can taste good.

Lately I've been thinking about how much Inuvik has grown on me. With winter finally here, and some new friends made, my little arctic town has turned into a fun place to be. As long as I have my two trips to see my family and friends back in Ottawa, could see myself setting down some roots and staying for quite a few years. 

Anyways, it's weather time(I'm at work)and I have to go outside and look at the pretty snow. Cheers!"

"event","My trip to Vegas is booked. Staying in the big pyramid for a week, and I get to see my family and friends right after. I'm giddy just thinking about it(of course, it could just be all the caffeine I have had on this midnight shift...) I do still have to book my leg from Calgary to Ottawa to Edmonton, but that is the easy part of the whole process. Getting out of here was the dicey part. I managed to get the last seat on the jet out to Edmonton. I thought I was booking early! 
   On another note, winter is coming in full force. The temperature is now in the -5 to -10 range, or 25-30 F for those State side. I am jealous, though. I have had my snowmobile out for a quick spin, but I cannot ride it just yet, because I need more snow. I have what is classified as a ""mountain sled"", which has a much bigger track with bigger lugs on it. My sled is also liquid cooled, so as a result I can't go on the snow covered roads for long periods of time without overheating the engine. I need some powder or snow pack to get out. Hurry up and snow, Dammit!!!"

"event","ahhhh....Monday morning. I have to go back to sleep this afternoon, I start my run of midnights this evening. The weeekend was mostly snowmobile maintenance. Changed out the oil in the chaincase as well as the injectors, replaced the belt, adjusted the suspension, and replaced the spark plugs. Now, the first thing that needs to be known is that when it comes to anything mechanical, I am an inept boob. these fairly small tasks took me about 7 hours to complete. I still have to remove the pipe and replace the fitting for where the pipe exits from the sled. I could'nt do it yesterday because I didn't have a depp socket to fit and it is in an  awkward place to use a conventional wrench. 

Last night, some of the girls decided to have a pumpkin carving night, followed by a bonfire at Airport Lake. I somehow managed to get suckered into judging with Darryl and Smitty. I have to say, some of the carvings were brialliant! The was a cat, a dragon, cyclops, a ghost, an evil clown, Shrek, a skull with a tophat, and a big mouth with actually breathed fire. the winners were the evil clown, the dragon, and the fire breathing mouth. 

The bonfire was pretty cool, too. I almost lost my truck to the ditch on my way down to the lake, when I remembered that I had 4X4, and engaged the wheels, thus ending my date with the ditch. I made 3 gallond of hot chocolate for everyone, and of course a litlle Irish cream on the side for luck. I was worried that I would'nt be able to make it back up to the top f the hill, but had no problems. Today, I have to go to the store to get a spare belt for the sled, and a deep socket to take the pipe off. Other than that, the agenda has more sleep, and maybe a little football this evening. If I am sleepy, I'll just tape it and watch the game at work. I should also get to the video store and see if I can get my hands on The Matrix reloaded. I'll guess no, but it's worth a shot. Cheers."

"event","Well, I'm not contagious. Thank goodness. I did stay home today, even though I probably could have went to work. What the hell, I have the leave to burn. I am starting to get a little cabin fever, and I'll probably get out for a walk this evening, just to get out for a bit. 

//skip to next day// ...so I went to work today, my voice being fine and all. Until about 11, when the wee little voice fairy decided that, quite frankly, she had had enough of listening to me extoll weather briefings upon the masses, and promptly took away said voice. So now I am back at home, being useless  to do much of anything at work, and have a three day weekend. Going fishing on Saturday, and I will probably install my amplifiers into the Explorer this weekend at some point. I may even try to swat down that fairy and get my voice back....."

"event","I didn't really do much today. My voice has come back, but the glands in my neck are still somewhat sore. I didn't hear anything back from the doctor, so I don't think I have strep, but rather a case of larangytis.(I hope I spelled that right) I did get some organizational stuff done for Cubs, which I have putting off for a couple of weeks, now. I also have to a budget for the year, so I'll probably do that tomorrow, since I am staying home one more day from work. I figure that my work depends on me being able to speak clearly, so I don't want to rush back, and have my voice go again. Bedtime. Cheers."

"event","I had to take today and tomorrow off, since I've lost my voice. The doctor thinks it may be strep throat. SO in the meantime, I am quarantined in my house until the lab results come back, which should be tomorrow. If it comes back that I do have strep, I'll have to miss the rest of the week, the antibiotics take 2 days to kick in. Not that I am complaining, though...a week home isn't such a bad thing. I'm not really feeling pooey, like when you have the flu, I just can't talk much above a whisper. Does kind of suck though, I'm going to have to miss the first Cub meeting of the year.
   Not much has happened in Inuvik over the past month. My friend Tanya, who lives next door with her three roommates come by quite a bit to watch movies and chill out, which is cool. It's nice to have people around, without having to sacrifice my privacy with having a roommate of my own. I get out canoeing a lot, but that is quickly coming to an end, as freeze-up is already starting. I'll still be able to get out to Campbell Creek for some fishing action. Well, as soon as I am able to leave the house again. 
    I did finally pay off the painting I put on layaway in February. A Robert Bateman called ""Arctic Cliffs"". It's gorgeous, and I am very pleased with the job that the framing shop did. It looks great in the house. Speaking of the house, there has been a lot of re-arranging. My gargantuan entertainment unit was moved upstairs to one of my empty rooms, and is now my den/media storage room. This accomodates the new home theatre downstairs. I also had to move my old bed to the other empty room. The bed is only 3 years old, but I wanted to upsize to a queen bed. I have now successfully managed to fill a three bedroom house. I don't know what I'll do if I ever move back into an apartment. 
   Last, more as a commitment to myself, now that winter is coming, and I'll be home more often, I'll start posting in here more frequently. Cheers.

P.S. to <lj user=""varconis""> ...Welcome home, bud. I hope you enjoy your few weeks with family and friends. Wish I could be there to catch up."

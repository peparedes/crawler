Lots of guys have bigger breasts than I do. And they don't tire of telling me. That's interesting.

I had a good day! I love my last two hours. They're very amusing. I had subs in hours 1,3, and 4. The one in 1st hour was rather fond of me. I don't know why, though. I spent most of her class in mrs.okelberry's room with Misty. Pretty not-eventful for most of the day. Well . . . After lunch was interesting. Lunch itself was lonely. Lots of people felt sorry for me 'cause I was all alone! But that's ok. I didn't feel sorry for me.

Amanda says that Danielle Bryce and I are like Lizzie McGuire. And I would be Lizzie. *giggle* I guess it fits. I just tried to stand up but tripped and broke the keyboard on the way down. I'm not a klutz! I'm <i>not</i>!

Chris cheated off my test today. It was funny. He wasn't trying to hide it. 

This morning I attended mr. May's 0 hour class. It was funny. I fell asleep while he was talking to them, though. llama el's computadoria Liberator (o, libby). . .

Bryce looked good. (:.

A lot of people ride my bus. . . a lot. And I know a ton of them, too. I made a new friend. . . Sean o Shawn. He's fun and wears all black. He had fishnet on. He dresses like the cheerleader does.

<lj-cut text=""this is interesting"">
This sounds like science fiction, but it's not. The woman who stars in this bizarre story--which is not from a supermarket tabloid, but rather the venerable New England Journal of Medicine--is now 52 years old. Her name is Jane. Jane had three sons, all grown now and all of whom were conceived and born the natural way. When one of them needed a kidney transplant, she learned that she--the mother--was not biologically related to her own child. Tests proved that to be true for two of her three sons. It's as if Jane conceived and gave birth to another woman's children. 

The study, which was more like an investigation, was led by Dr. Margot Kruskall of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. New Scientist reports that Kruskall concluded that Jane is a chimera, a mixture of two individuals. What happened is that Jane's mother conceived two non-identical twin sisters whose cells intermingled in the womb and instead of growing into two people, fused into a single body. 

The cells from one twin dominate in Jane's blood, but in other tissues, including her ovaries, cells from both twins live alongside each other. And that explains why two of her three sons have the genetics of Jane's fraternal twin. It's as if Jane gave birth to her unborn twin sister's children. There are about 30 instances of chimerism that have been reported worldwide."

"event","GRR! You know, it calmed down for a while and we were getting along great. Chris has some sort of senser that tells him when I've had a good day just so he can ruin it for me. He unplugged the computer. Why? Because I didn't say 'ok' when he told me there was a light on in my room.

People are mean. Where are the koala bears?

I had a good day. Did you?

Well, my afternoon was good. . . We played a game to review for the test. I want to play the game again. It was fun. Only because my group won, though. Heheh. The 10 point question at the end was easy, but no one except me knew it. Turns out the answer to the last question was not 'do you like green eggs and ham?' hehe. He asked a sports question, so I put do you like green eggs and ham? But that's ok! Because we ended up with 18.5 points. :) AND Extra Credit. I'm glad for the extra credit. . . I don't have an A in that class anymore. Or in Spanish, either. I'll do extra credit in there but I don't know if it'll help. I have B's in 4/6 classes. SLACKER!!! Just like Cody calls me. Hey . . . *giggle* Dairick and Josh got extra credit today too. They're funny kids. I think they scare Chris. Chris was wearing my crown today. That's why we won. . . I think. Hehe. . . Hum. . . I was really hyper today. But then Bryce was being mean just a second ago so now I'm not. He's still upset with me, but will not tell me why. And he really is this time. . . EE! I got a 48/50 on my essay. I think the best way for me to judge the grade I'm going to recieve on my essays is by how little I like them. I hated both essays I've written so far this year. . . but I got really good grades on both. . . I was elated by my score, though :). Then my day just kept going up and up and up. I didn't see much of my friends, though. I'm thinking Mr.Tito is avoiding me. And Karin had NHS and Danielle was in Pottery. . . so I went into . . . surprise!. . . the journalism lab. It's a good thing I love that class. Because I am the least liked person there, so I would end up dropping out if I wasn't in love with it. That's me. I don't go where I'm not wanted. Unless they bluntly tell me I'm not wanted. Then I'll just stick around to annoy them :). . . Biology was great. We should have more classes like that. *chomp* Carrots are good. But not cooked carrots. Nellie should join journalism. Bryce wore a pretty shirt today. That picture ovver there has green eyelashes. I don't know why it's hanging up. It's my visual metaphor for kleffner. I think I'll hang it on the wall above my bed. I've started collecting little things from this year up there. Like all of my stories and pictures and awards and things. Well, award. I only have one :). I'll get another one at the end of the year. *giggle* I remember when I first got the computer I had a lot of fun making awards. Hehehehe. I wasn't the brightest kid. Broccoli is yummy. Do you like broccoli? I do. But I'm allergic to it. I ate all the broccoli Danielle and I bought. I felt really sick after. I think I should start reading those books that Karin loaned me. I kind of stole them from her and if they're here too long they'll get ruined. I'm going to go do that right now since. . . I DON'T HAVE HOMEWORK! EEEK! Except. . . I have 3 tests tomorrow *sigh*! OK! I'm going to go study now. I hope this entry amused you. Did it make sense? It seems sort of random and disorganized. Hehehe in Biology Chris got really annoyed with me. It was funny. I would write the right answer on the paper, then say the wrong answer. Heh, I'm rather fond of Chris. He's a nice kid and has neat hair. Does anyone else have him in any of their classes?"

"event","I want to be in a new place.

A place where I'm not known or thought of as Bryce's friend, or Danielle's friend or Chris's sister or Kent's daughter Alex. A place where I have a chance to be what I am. . . not what I used to be.

I try to explain to people what I mean, but they jump to their own conclusions about me.  They listen to half my side, then believe what they want to about me. They say I'm stubborn, but only because I won't go over to their side easily. Their not used to that. To them, their side is the right side and anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong, and stubborn when they won't believe their side, or the majority, right away. Just like today in Biology. I was sitting at my table and we were doing a chapter review. They both had one answser and I had a different one. They automatically assumed they were right and we argued over it for a while. Then I proved them wrong. Little things like that happen all the time. Or when Danielle and I were proofing the paper in the journalism lab. She went through and since every other headline was upstyle, she marked my page saying I should go to upstyle instead of downstyle. In the staff handbook it says headlines are to be written in downstyle. I don't do it to be different. If I thought majority was right in a particular case, I'd agree with them. Maybe I am stubborn, but so are they. That's just the way people are. They think one thing and they don't want to be proved wrong. None of you do.

Everyone around me is either growing further away from me or I can't stand to be around them anymore.

My mom never tells me what to do. Everyday she tells Katy and Chris to do chores, but she just ignores me. She never tells me to clean my room or brush my teeth or take a shower or do my homework. She tells Katy and Chris to do these things all the time. Katy and Chris have curfews and bedtimes and things, but I don't. It's funny, to complain about her trusting me too much.

My dad called tonight. He was disappointed when I answered. He hardly said anything to me. Just asked for anyone else and told me he moved into a motel and the room number, then hung up. He has stopped saying he loves me and everything. I don't understand why he loathes me so much. I don't get why any of my family does. I don't do anything to them. I'm too shy, so I hide. They accuse me of not making an effort, but how much of an effort do they make? Calling and when I answer asking for someone else right off. I know I don't reach out, but it would be nice if they recognized that they don't either.

Chris doesn't have a job anymore. So he has gone back to acting like a jerk around here and doing what he wants. The little things that he does make me so mad. And he gets mad at me, too. Like, when I don't jump up right away. I was reading earlier and he got mad when I wouldn't drop the book and show him something on the computer right away.

Danielle and I hardly ever talk anymore, and I should be sad about this. But I'm not, and it's not because I don't like her. I love her to death. It's because I want to be alone, so us not talking is making that that much easier for me.

Bryce is mad at me again. I don't know what to say about that because I don't understand what he's mad about. FYI, Bryce, I don't think it's an act.

I've started to loathe Mr. Balsai's class more and more. Karin said ""Why? Because he makes you think?"" HAH! People only believe he makes us think. He's such a hypocrite. He's telling us what to think, not how to think. He's spouting off his own ideas and views, hoping we'll take that and start believing it, hoping we'll swallow it and regurgitate in our own words and so-called own opinions. I'm not swallowing. I'm choking on them. He hides it so well that everyone honestly believes what he's saying is right and when they repeat it, it's their ideas, not his. It makes me sick to see him create mini-hypocrites. Everyone does it. Everyone is trying to convince you that their way is the right way. Whether they play like Balsai and hide that behind some cheap rhetoric or not is up to them.

I feel sorry for people. I feel sorry for the way they think and feel and act. This includes myself. We're not real. We don't have dimension. What I'm saying is not real. What I'm saying is the words of thousands of men before me. I took the idea because I thought it sounded 'cool' and I reworded it so now it's 'pretty' and I'm posting it for you all to see. They're not my words. They told me what to believe and I put it together to relate to the present. They're not my words. Bryce asked tonight why I'm so negative. Well, if you just stopped and looked around, saw the world from my eyes, and I'm sure a lot of other people's eyes, because I can't be the only one who sees it, you'd know why I am so negative. People are so cheap, and they'll take anything they're fed.

I want to be in a new place. A place where I don't have to feel guilty for who I am. A place where I don't have to hesitate to post this because it's not all positive and will, no doubt, offend the masses. Well, screw that. Go ahead, tell me how I'm wrong."

""Everything that holds me together is starting to fall apart""

I had a good day! EEK!

Not like one of those days when it starts out good then ends badly like most good days. My day has been good from start to finish. *scratches nose*

Want to hear about it? I didn't think so! but I'll tell you anyway.

It started out waking up at 7:30 which was crazy because I went to bed really early. Well, 10:00, but that's earlier than usual. Then I got ready, and made danielle wait while I brushed my teeth.

When we got to school we had to wait for Mrs. Balls to get there. We went to Mr.Balsai's classroom and talked to Karin. Her hair was pulled back today. Muy bonita! She's always muy bonita, but she doesn't like to hear it. She's also smart, too. The paper boy gave me bad genes.

When Mrs. Balls go to school we talked to her, and she seems pretty excited to have Danielle join staff. Maybe because I told her Danellie is my best friend and she's just happy that I have friends.  She also said she likes what I'm doing for the paper. cool!

Then Mr. Balsai's class was boring, as usual. The best day in his class was when he wrote 'why' up on the board and had us answer.

More people said I'm cute. I'M NOT! I'm hot! Like a turkey! Jeeze!

I failed my math test. But I don't feel bad. Everyone did. Well, one person got a C, but everyone else failed. I'm assuming I'm one of the failers. Math isn't my strongest subject.

I sold my ad for next issue! WHEE! Yay! Mrs. Novak is even going to tell Julie no because it's already been sold to me. I'm so happy! I'm beginning to like Mrs. Novak. She's really easy. Like her class is super easy and she's very nice and she runs the student store so we get out, like, 10 minutes early on days when she has some food in the store since we're fourth hour. That happened yesterday. And tomorrow, too. My grade in that class is good.

I spent lunch with Mr. Bryce. I scared the kid out of the restroom. I feel bad for that. And I made Kelvin feel badly, too. How do I do it, when Bryce is ten times meaner to Kelvin than I am? I don't think his friends like me very much. They came up and were all over him, then looked over and saw me and were like 'lets go' and all piled off. Hm. . . Do I smell badly?

Fifth hour was fun. Got made fun of for to do my work. I like that new kid. . . Chris. He's very nice and doesn't mind sitting with Sam and I, who are freaks. He actually likes us. Heather and Liz think he's. . . uhm. . . very good looking. Those girls are ALWAYS talking about guys. I told Tony and Deirick that I'm a guy and I'm gay. Tony freaked out. . . *smile*. You should have seen him. It was very funny.

I was very very hyper after school and my grade in Spanish has dropped 11% in a week. I asked a bunch of people if they were happy. The girl on the bike is!

When I got home chris was making me mad so I went into my room, played AFI and played my bass in the dark. I tore up my fingers, but it was very therepeutic. . .

01. I love dying my hair.
02. I am a grammar whore. One day out of boredom I was trying to say my  brother, sister, and my names in chronological order, but couldn't do it because my name would be in the middle and I kept saying ""Chris, Katy and I"" or ""Katy, Chris and I."" I couldn't put myself in the middle. It was fun.
03. Karin, Lara, and I are going to start a support group for people with bad eyes. Karin will be president.
04. I am a slob. Messes just follow me around. It's crazy. I'll clean my room and a week later it'll be a disaster again. And I'll clean my locker but it'll get messy again by the end of the day.
05. I am very homophobic, but I try to not let on because I have friends who are un-straight and I think they would be offended.
06. I can't stand when people misspell. It's fascination, Danielle, not facination.
07. I can't help but correct people or tell them the answer even when they don't ask me, and it annoys me when they don't believe me when I tell them. Danellie and I had a fight about this last year.
08. Nellie and I are complete opposites and it makes for an interesting friendship. When we argue, we both assume the other is being stubborn (hey! we're not wrong).
09. I do have a crush on my best friend. As much as I wish I could stop it, I can't, because he's the greatest person I've ever met.
10. I will say that looks don't matter, but I really love to hear compliments from people about the way I look and it boosts my ego for a long long time. Even when I hear it from people who don't interest me and I wish wouldn't notice my looks.
11. I have a really hard time expressing gratitude and as much as  I wish I could tell/show someone how I feel, I always chicken out when I get in the moment.
12. I like talking about myself, but I like talking about other people more. I don't know what questions to ask that will make people open up to me.
13. I tend to fall for and love the under dog.
14. I don't like when people tell me how to think or what to do. Especially when it was already what I was going to do or what I think already. Like when my mom tells me that I don't have to like my dad and she's ok with me not seeing him. Or when she tells me to do a chore that I'm working on as she tells me to do it.
15. I'm extremely facetious and sarcastic.
16. I tend to argue just for the sake of arguing. Not really for blood, but I'll argue points that I disagree with just to argue, in time I'll begin corrupting myself into believing the point that I'm arguing for.
17. I am very manipulative. This includes with myself. I can twist something into something anyone would believe was true.
18. During the summer I love staying up all night just to take a walk in the morning. I go to the park or something and I swing. Once I picked up garbage around the park just because I loved the atmosphere of the morning and had nothing better to do.
19. I am an insomniac
20. I get everything I ask for and everything I get, I've asked for. Like with my friends and the way I allow them to step all over me. I ask them to use me as a pillow to land on when they fall backward, but get mad when they use me as the safety net.
21. I am a pack rat. That's probably why the messes follow me around.
22. I live in the past which is probably why I love history so much.
23. I am the strangest procrastinator ever. I eat to avoid doing homework and I clean to avoid eating.
24. I hate silence and I tend to babble my head off when I get nervous. Making people believe I'm a freak.
25. I am a freak.
26. I despise when Bryce asks why I like him. Mostly because I don't know how to answer it.
27. I am addicted to fishing. For compliments, that is. I want to transfer to Poky, but all you need to say is that you want me around instead of making up excuses as to why I should be around. If you said that you want me around because I'm your friend, I would drop it and never mention leaving again. I can't help doing the fishing thing, it always just . . . happens.
28. I can only sleep through loud noises in Math class. That class puts me to sleep.
29. I am a heretic.
30. I save aim conversations.
31. People love my bluntness when I compliment them, but hate it when I insult them.
32. I am a macroverbumsciolist. And I like it!
33. A day doesn't go by when someone doesn't call me cute. It drives me nuts, but I like it all the same.
34. Sadistic music makes me giggle. ""Swallow choke and DIE!""
35. I love the smell of matches.
36. When someone hints something to me, I'll understand it but be too afraid that I'm wrong to let them know that I understood.
37. My hygene habits are a lot different than most females of my age and I spend hardly any time in front of the mirror.
38. I am overprotective of Bryce. A lot more protective than I am of me. And I get really worried about him sometimes even though he can take care of himself a lot better than I can.
39. I LOATHE hanging around Bryce, Karin, and Danielle at any one time in any combination. It really brings out the worst in me.
40. I love being the cute, sweet, innocent girl I am and I love the attention it gets me, but I still complain about it.
41. I say a lot of things I don't mean and hurt a lot of people when I do. Then I try to take it back but they won't listen. I don't blame them, though.
42. I love confrontation.
43. I can't resist reflective surfaces!
44. I'm the clumsiest person you will ever meet.
45. I dress and look unprofessional but it really makes me mad when someone treats me unprofessionally. I'm out to change the world on this, and I know it's not going to work, but I just need the chance to prove that I'm as good as everyone else even though I refuse to conform to society's rules about how one should dress *gag* I hate the way other people dress anyway.
46. Emo music makes me really really happy.
47. Rock music depresses me. Seriously depresses me.
48. I have a really good long-term memory but a terrible short-term memory and it's the most obnoxious thing ever, I think it scares some people.
49. Danielle isn't the only person who has never gotten high or drunk. The difference between the two of us is I don't have any desire to do either, she's curious.
50. I get easily infatuated with people, but very seldom do I actually like them.
51. I realized today that I am a huge flirt. I don't meant to. I just kind of end up flirting.
52. I'm hot like a turkey
53. I have tons of quirks.
54. I'm really easy going.
55. I am a completely different person around my family.
56. I'm victim to all those girlish insecurities. Like, I think I'm fat. *chomps brownie* but I mock myself for it! My mommy makes the greatest brownies. Why can't skills be genetic? Actually, it's probably best that skills aren't gentetic. These brownies are really good!
57. My taste in music is really broad. I like everything from Third Eye Blind to AFI. I like country music, pop music, punk, rock . . . everything except rap. EEEEEEEEWWWWWWW!!!!
58. I laugh at my own jokes.
59. Laughter makes me laugh.
60. I love to jump up and down in public. Like at concerts or dances. I can't dance so I jump up and down. It's fun!
61. Sometimes I'll catch myself doing something I hadn't planned to do, like dancing, or twirling in circles or talking to myself. Often I'll catch myself after someone is always staring at me like I'm a freak.
62. I'm a freak.
63. I really do care what people think. I just want to be seen differently than most people would want to be seen.
64. I can't retain water. If I drink any more than 8 ounces in 2 hours, I'll be in the bathroom every five minutes. It's obnoxious. I can never get my recommended 8 glasses of water and I'm always dehydrated.
65. Danielle and I are obsessed with making 4-year plans. I think at the end of 2nd semester senior year, we'll finally have one that we won't end up changing.
66. I desperately want to take every English class offered, but there aren't enough hours in the day.
67. I can never learn too much and I think I'm going to be a forever-college student crashing on Karin's couch.
68. I am in love with Journalism.
69. I tend to love things that I'm good at.
70. I take abuse from everyone. I think this is something that I got from years of my dad physically and emotionally abusing mom and us kids. Statistics say I'm more likely to have abusive relationships. I love everyone too much, though, to tell them when they're hurting me.
71. I don't fall in and out of like very easily.
72. I'm terrible at taking and giving hints.
73. I refuse to sell Bryce my halloween candy. I don't care how much he begs.
74. Chris does the smallest things that can piss me off to no end. I'm watching Roseanne right now and he turned it down, so I turned it back up, then I left the computer and he turned the screen off. It made my blood pressure skyrocket.
75. I once tried, unsuccessfully, to be a vegitarian. Now that I lost the title, I rarely eat meat.
76. I get very little sleep at night. I got about 4 hours last night.
77. My alarm clock doesn't wake me up anymore.
78. I, like Danielle, push friends away until I give in and they become my friend. I don't mean to. . . I don't even notice I'm doing it. I just don't know how to act around people.
79. My cat is crazy. She just ran head first into my leg.
80. I often aide in the cheating of others. Err. . . I let people copy my work and I give them all the answers if I figure them out.

I was following Max Shipley around. . . that went on for a while and he turned and snapped at me yelling something about how just because I'm beautiful doesn't mean I can treat him like he's nothing. That didn't make any sense. If you know Max and I even at all, you know that he doesn't think I'm good looking and he's always been the one to treat me like I'm nothing. Then the next thing I can remember, I was at a . . . mall, I think, with Bryce. We were walking around and I was watching him, when all of a sudden I realized he wasn't just 1 person. . . but two. Both of my best friends were him. Then we (Bryce, the other Bryce, and I) were walking around and Kelvin was there beheaded. He looked really scared and said I had to kiss him so his head would go back on, but I wouldn't, so I made Bryce give him a hug and his head went back on. . . that's all I remember. It was an odd dream.

If you said that you could kill the things inside me 
You're just a liar, everything inside me's dead 
It's nice of you to think that I could ever be that 
But I'm not, I'm just a failure instead 

Don't preach a story of success and gifted thinking 
Because in the end were gonna end up the same way 
Keep on living your whole life on hands and knees 
'Cause I'll be standing waiting, life ends the same way 

Never wanted this life 
Because it's meaningless 
Gone away from me 

The life you've given is a poorly painted picture 
The colors running and it's staggering my life 
A definition of the truth is all I wanted 
Not mental beatings falling short of stupidity 

Don't give a speech on your prolific ways of living 
You speak in vain whether you think you do or not 
Spreading infection of the truth that leads to sick lies 
You are the shame inside of me, you mindrot 

Never wanted this life

You're so mistaken on the life you think I wanted 
I'll give you credit for the effort you put forth

Letting these hopeless thoughts run my life

All these lies have left me torn 

It's only this way falling on my own

It was nobody's fault, it was all my own 
Everything's wasted forever

Went and saw Brother Bear. The environment of the theater sucked. They had it in one of the back theaters where the lights never go out and the sound sucks *nod* plus there was a toddler stalking me the whole time.

It was a good movie. Sad, but good. It made my mommy cry. Hehe. I wasn't sitting with her. I had the row to myself and I was laying across 4 seats. It was comfy. The part where Koda and. . . I can't spell his name (The bear-man) are travelling to the fish-place reminded me of Bryce and I. It was kind of scary. The bear-man was trying to get away from Koda, but Koda kept following. Bear-man would go off course on purpose to get away and Koda would still follow. But in the end Bear-Man loves Koda. Just like Bryce loves me, in the end *smile*

Today was a good day. I got an offer to befriend someone :). . . He's a nice kid, but his spelling-skills are awful. At lunch Bryce wasn't talking to me. So I just sat down. Kelvin and him are violent. It was a fun lunch hour. The best of this year by far. Then fifth hour was entertaining. As it always is. Deirick(is that right?) branded me. He was being nice. I wasn't prepared for that. It was odd. Everyone was nice to me today. It was weird. Even my kitty is being nice right now. And Chris is giving me his stereo. *scratches head* Was it 'Be-Nice-To-Alli-Day'? If it was, you should have informed me! I would have milked it for all it was worth!!!

If you would just stop to listen you might start to know. But that's the problem with people. They don't listen. And when they don't know, they don't want to be corrected. I'm a good example of that.

I don't really give others a chance to hear, either. I don't make noise. And when I do someone ends up mad at me because I don't care to finish my thought.

"event","<b>From A Balance Beam</b>
There's a man holding a megaphone
he must have been the voice of God
The bystanders claimed they saw angels
flying up and down the block
They must have been attached to wires
I seen one laying in the lawn
with a broken arm
so I called 911
Well that's one less founded opinion
One more cause for a dispute
So the street filled like a basin
up with cameras and their crews
and they washed away the rumors
leaving just the concrete truth
It was a spectacle
No, I mean a miracle
And so I fell like that girl from a balance beam
A gymnasium of eyes
all were holding on to me
I lifted one foot to cross the other
and I felt myself slipping
<b>It was a small mistake
Sometime's that's all it takes</b>
Now I'm staring at my wrist, hoping that the time is right
When the planets will align
There will be no planets to align
Just the carcass of the sun and those little painted marbles spinning 
senseless through an endless black sky
(and so it never started and it will never stop just like I am and you are)
It was in a foreign hotel's bathtub I baptized myself and changed
And one by one I drowned all of the people I had been.
And I emerged to find the parallels were fewer
I was cleansed
<b>I looked in the mirror and
someone new was there</b>
but <b>I was as helpless as a chess piece when I was lifted up by 
someone's hand
And delivered from the corner my enemies had got me in
But in all of my salvation I still felt imprisoned'Inside that holding cell
<i>That is myself</i>
So I wait for the day when I hear the key
as it turns in the lock and the guard will say to me:
""Oh my patient prisoner you have waited for this day and finally....
You are free! You are free! You are free!""</b>
Now I'm staring at the sun
waiting for it to explode
Because a day is gonna come, don't know when
but it will come
And we'll finally know the way
out of here.
And I will throw away this wrinkled map and my chart of stars and compass, cracked
And I'll climb that tree all wet with sap, to avoid the hungry beasts below
I'll cut out my lover's tongue and sing
of a graveyard gray and a garden green
and we won't have to worry no more
<b>No, we won't have to wonder again about how this song or story ends,
about how this song and story will end</b>"

You're into fun - but it has to be your own brand of fun<br />
Drinking? No thanks. You rather spend your time differently...<br />
Whether it's talking with friends, taking up a hobby, or reading<br />
You're not the type to socialize just for socializing's sake!

You are hopeful and romantic. You love many people and many things.<br />
You aren't unrealistic, but you do imagine things in the most ideal way possible.<br />
<br />
You are a dreamer. If something exists, you've probably thought about it.<br />
You don't think about what is, you think about what could be.<br />

It may take you a while to kiss someone...<br />

But when you do, it's total fireworks

You are a very considerate person, but that doesn't mean you let people walk all over you.<br />
<br />
You spend a lot on clothes, and you tend to be a very dresser. However, it's hard for you to throw away trendy clothes when they go out of style.<br />
<br />
You have the perfect blend of confidence and class. You're proud of who you are - but you don't broadcast it.<br />
<br />
In relationships, you tend to be very romantic and demanding. You'll treat your partner like gold, but you expect a lot in return.

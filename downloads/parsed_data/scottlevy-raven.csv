"event","I am still in awe of what was done on Smackdown! The Justice of the Peace was trying to calm down Billy, Chuck, and Rico, then says what Billy and Chuck have is sacred, whether it be 50 years, 16 months, or even 3 minutes. And my eyes widen a little as I heard him say that, a few fans caught on and cheered at first. The Justice of the Peace put his hand to his throught, and then said:

 ""Wait a minute..."" 

and everyone went wild!

""Did I just hear myself say....3 minutes?!""

It was amazing, he rips off the mask and face paint to reveal Eric Bischoff, a CLASSIC WWE moment. I must applaude them of that. But then on Raw, I have to boo them...REALLY loud. They did the same thing on Raw, only worse!! Stephanie, being the horrible actress she is, had to be some side woman in order to pull it off, and she did it horribly. I would love to know what is going to happen on Unforgiven between Jamal and Rosie and Billy and Chuck, but they never tell me anything anymore. I am going to HEAT this sunday to face Goldust and lose infront of everyone...great....I get to lose against a gay guy...."

"event","I was watching a lot of tapes from when I was in ECW. I miss preforming in the hardcore style, I probably never will again seeing as Eric took out the WWE Hardcore title. Damn, a 27 time Hardcore Champion rests at that. 

Eric Bischoff says letting me back to Raw is out of his hands....it sucks. Althought I may still be contracted to Raw, I can only appear on HeAT and Raw sideshows...Oh well....One more day will turn around....

I love how I see the fans chanting ECW whenever people like myself, Rob Van Dam, Tommy Dreamer, and Spike Dudley wrestle each other. Most people seem to forget Steven Richards is a former ECW Superstar. I still wish ECW would come back, WWE is not hardcore...there is no way out of it, the hardcore style seen in ECW will only be a memory now. The only time hardcore will ever show in WWE again is in Ladder Match, or TLC Matches. Table Matches are rarely hardcore, they just go through a table, nothing special about it."

"event","WWE House Shows left and right. Beaten by D'Lo on Sunday. I've been so busy, not much time to update much journal as of lately. Eric will not give me a direct answer if I can come back to Raw, he claims he may not have a place for me. If he doesn't give me an answer soon I may have to resort to calling Stephanie to see if she may have a spot open for me. But in my opinion, I think Raw holds the better storylines, thus I'd rather perform there, other than defect to the inferior Smackdown!"

"event","I watched Smackdown! of course. I did see improvement in the storylines since last week, but it seems to me that Stephanie is too determend to beat Eric Bischoff and is losing it. Personally, I think Raw has the upper hand at this point, and will for most of the term."

I don't know what WWE has in store for me in the future, maybe Eric Bishchoff will remember my old days in WCW and sign me. I guess I'll impatiently wait for what the future holds..."

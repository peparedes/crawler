"event","don't call it a come back i been here for years..........

o.k. i made a promise to myself to start back updateing this monster more often and i will try.  after all the crying i did about working in memphis i got my shot.  not so great either there were a list of things that went wrong with that and i don't want to get in to too many details so here goes...not enough money... and that is the short version believe me.  corinth is looking up a little though money wise, and i pass the time nicely at the local bowling alley with my main man josh.  we are working on a few pilot episodes for a t.v. show we thought up and are gonna send them to a couple of networks i will keep you posted.

i have been producing a lot of artwork here at the house, i don't think that matters to anyone but i have.  i feel like i am to old nowadays and i want to get slower about things, this whole street tattoo shop mentality is starting to wear on me and i don't know what to do.  i feel like an outsider all the time, so i been thinking of opening my own studio again.  just a small one with an art studio/gallery and appointment only tattoos.  i just am not getting to do anything interesting or of any size in corinth.  jonathan has that town sewn up i can't tell you how many people pass me by like i am not worth shit, ""jonathan is the best so ask him will ya"" is all i hear day in and day out.  now don't get me wrong here he is seriously talented and a well rounded tattooist, the best to come out of corinth yet, and that is it.  he is from there and people know him and he deserves every bit of recognition that he get's.  the thing is that i got used to doing custom big stuff and now i am busted down to baby mama names and tribal. the few chance i have had to do some good original stuff i have really shown off, but they are really far and few between. i even have the stuff up that has been published in magazines and i still eat shit.  i spent 45 min. one time drawing for a customer getting it just right, then i set up and got ready to tatt her and she says ""oh i thought jonathan was gonna tattoo it i just wanted you to draw it"".

ahhhhhhhhhhhh none of it will make a hill of beans in the morning, i am just frustrated.  so all i am doing now is just producing artwork.  i am really excited about watercolor right now it has been a chalenge to get the look i want but it is all coming together.  i am gonna do some prints soon for sale i will post pics of them.

adios"

"event","well i guess this is as good a story as any.  i finally got a new modem after my first one got dropped into a dog water bowl.  they don't exactly give laptop modems away......fuckers.

i want to work in memphis


o.k so it all started off like any other day drive to work and the typical shit for this shop was going on.when in walks mr. butcher, a local home tattooer guy, he sucks bad but that is beside the point.

as i was telling mr. robinson of the tcbsk8shop earlier this week about three weeks ago i get a call from johnathan my current shop boss telling me of a attempted break in at the shop.  seems that mr. butcher had been on the roof all night working away at breaking through the roof into the tattoo shop.  but being a dumb ass he misses us by about 4 feet and gets into the cingular wireless place next door.  now this guiy is a true moron as i intend to prove.  the sun aparently was coming up on mr. butcher as he hacked away at the roof so he decided to hop on down, put his shovel and crowbar that he had been using to get through the roof and get all the material shingels and whatnot, put them in his car, pull around front and park his car. -how about that for a run on sentence-  mr. butcher then walks to a payphone calls the police and tells them that he was driving by and saw someone on the roof of the tattoo shop.  they show up.  check him out in his sweaty t shirt dirty knees and boots, search his car and find what is in the trunk, cuff him run his record and discover he had two priors for robbery.  bingo got their man.

fast foreward to 3:15 today, i want to work in memphis


mr. butcher decided to come today and buy some jewelry.  mistake.
johnathan pulls me in the back and tells me who he is becouse i had never seen him before.  they already have a history.
""that's that motherfucker that tried to break in here, after all i have donee for him he tried to steal all our shit.  man he has some balls."" johnathan said

""what are you gonna do?"" i said

""teach him a lesson"" with that he walked down the hall

i followed him to the front waiting area to find mr. butcher crouched down looking at the jewelry through the glass case.  he was knelt down squatting and.....
johnathan kicked him square in the face
knocked him over and beat the shit out of him 
stood him up beat the shit oiut of him some more split his eye open and fucked up alot of other shit on his face
threw him out with a kick and locked the door

i had to do the tattoo on his customer who was sitting in the waiting room with his mouth open the whole time because johnathan hurt his hand.

i have heard that there might be a chance that i could get on at underground art in memphis.  i hope i can get the job because i am not a thug and i don't think that this triple six mafia influenced enviroment is right for me.  i am no thug.  

i want to work in memphis

this has been bothering me for a while so i thought i would type it out.

the other day i am at cancun eating the lunch buffet like i am known to do.  i bring in my little magazine sit in my booth and order my tea.  i enjoy this time two things i love to merge, good food and reading.  get up and go to the buffet counter and there is this woman sweeping.  she notices my arm and asks me about my tatt's and i go into the usual bit about it and the shop and stuff.  then it starts she says ""do you know where i can buy a gun""  my smart ass remark is ""i dunno pawn shop?""  of course i know she ment tattoo machine.  calling it a gun is a slap in any tattoo artist face so it erks the hell out of any of us.  go ahead ask your local friendly ink man and he will more than likely agree.  

anyway turns out that she ""used to tattoo in chicago at her friends house but it is hard to get a decent gun if you are not in a shop.  i did this one.""  um to call it shit would be an understatement.  scar tissue faded shit.  but i can not tell her that that would be rude and no matter what you may think about owning a buisness the worst part is that you are always on the clock reputation always on the line if i told her what i really thought about her and that fucking gun not only would she not come to see me but ten of her friends wouldn't along with ten of their friends and so on so aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh is all hear in my head i seriously has turned into radio static in there.  i hear that story so much.

i am not on a pedastal seriously ask anyone who knows me or gets work from me, but if that is the best i could do i wouldn't brag.  it amazes me i see these shit infected tattoos on people who are so proud of them but turn their nose up at my portfolio.  the only real comfort i have is that this is not a new thing everyone i have talked to deals with the same.  

i can't eat anywhere or meet anyone that doesn't want to mention at some point that original idea they had for ""barbwire with a rebal flag torn on it.""  or ""butterfly on the small of my back, but i want it differnt i want mine......purple."" and in my head i am thinking um.... i did 4 of those this week. 

thank you to all of my friends who support me and have original good ideas i love you all.  and beth if you are reading this call  me about your work i am looking foreward to it. 

i saw an awesome t-shirt design in a trade mag today that said, 
off duty tattoo artist if you want to tallk tattoos call the shop

i love my job though it has equally great things.  i have met some of the most interesting people doing this.  from the guy who sat in my chair for and hour and a half and all he could thinkk to talk about to take his mind off the pain was the different ways to fuck barn animals.  to the 400 pound trailer park hooker from shannon who smelled like sourkrout throw up and got a lizard with the words ""get licking"" on her inner thigh.  i love this job.  i can't think of anything else that makes me dance on clouds today and pull my hair out with tweezers the next. 

i couldn't do anything else though."

"event","well it is after three and i just got home from a guest spot up north of here

deadication to the art

speaaking of the art subject i just recently finished up the first two prints in my series
and in the words of a ""friend"" of mine i probably won't sell a one but the thing is they are signed and numbered and i only want a ten spot a piece for em.  if anyone can tell me how to put them on here i would apreciate it i know it is a small task for either of the two matt's so let me know.

i am proud of myself though i actually got off the fat ass and took time to promote my fine art insted of customer drawing all the time.

it hit me on the way home i have not had any kind of vacation in 5 years work work worry work worry again.  i don't know sometimes.
painting again and doing other art projects have brought me from the brink i missed it so much.

i am gonna do 3 conventions next year my partner in crime and i decided it was time.  i turned down 4 of them this year after getting published in a few mags i got a invite like every other month but all i could hear in my mind was carrie's mother saying ""their all gonna laugh at you"" it seems i hear that alot when it comes to tattoing or painting or any of my endevors.  well let em laugh i have come to the realization that no one can point fingers if i have to accept that throwing paint at a canvas while it splatters filming through a fish eye lens with a naked woman caked in mud dancing to elton john who is holding the camera printed out in black and white with photo pencil highlights is art then i should be ale to pull off a few measly prints, tattoos, and conventions.

oh and i forgot, 
i also do pretty good ""baby's daddy names"" on boobs.

o.k. quick tattoo story
sitting in the shop minding my own buisness and such when in walks these three nice looking but not that nice women enter.  i start talking the usual blah blah and ask if they need help.
""what are you looking to do today"" ask i
""how much to get my baby name on my leg""she says

right there it starts my mind goes nuts on her while i keep a smile and never let her know how much i am screaming on the inside

""around $40.00, thats my minimum""
""what i can get it done at my friends house for ten""

pressure building

""sorry that is as low as i go"" say i

right then i catch a glimpse out of the corner of my eye of the bigger of the three give a nod and then she says....

""aight then""

so i am thinking hmmmmmmm gotta figure this out

anyway name was shaquanna..................shaquanna

so i write it out set up, shave her, stencil on, gloved up and listening to their conversations.
turns out these are ""working girls"" not in a union sence of the word
straight up party going ""working girls"" in town for a house party

right then i notice the""working girl"" no panty thing and almost loose lunch{i got scented gloves now they smell like peppermint no lie good quality glove that smells like peppermint ahhh sweet pepermint}remember now ""shaquanna"" her baby name gotta be on her upper thigh why....no answer there 

go through all that do the tattoo they get up to leave and guess who pays me 
shaquanna yep shaquanna the pimp labeled another money maker and i unknowingly helped this lady sink yet even further into the pitt of the ""working girls""

i felt like shit


sorry wherever you are and i hope shaquanna is treating you well

more to come"

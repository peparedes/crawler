"event","School was ok today. I had weight-training again after school and I think I'm doing pretty well at it. I'm getting muscles in places I didn't know muscles even existed! (like my bum lol) Just this weekend I've been getting pretty into crocheting, which is similar to knitting, but also a lot easier. My first project is to make a fairly, decent scarf, and I think it's coming along pretty well :D. I'm also off from school on Friday because of parent-teacher conferences and I hope to hang out with some of my friends. Just three more days of school and then I can relax for a three-day weekend! I can't wait!"

"event","I am so happy! First of all, yesterday was the award ceremony at Dwight. Guess what happened? I got Headmaster's List and second place in the ninth grade! I am so happy! Also, tonight we're heading to the Philippines already! I can't wait! Woohoo! What a great way to start Christmas vacation! 

However, despite all the excitement, I have to write an outline for my LaGuardia Paper for history, I have to write another paper on global warming for biology, and I have to work on my Arthur Ashe website for computer science class. Oh well, I'm still happy...hehehe..."

"event","I had a workout again today, and it was really tiring. We did ab workouts today, and boy are my abs weak! I got really tired and just couldn't do some of the exercises, they were just too tough. Oh well, guess I'm gonna be sore again tomorrow. I also had a computer science class today (I really dread those because my teacher is horrible!), but I did all my homework and didn't ask too many questions so he didn't have anything to complain about me today... hehe... See, our project is to make a website on Dreamweaver, and since that program is only in the school computer lab, you have to do your homework during lunch if you don't finish it during class because that is the only time that the lab is available. He gets really mad when people don't do their homework, yet even though I am not one of them, he still detests me for always asking questions because I don't get HTML!

Anyway, besides all the bad news, I did got the highest grade in my class on the Biology test! I was soo happy, that was the first time I ever got the highest grade in that class! My teacher Mr. Foster (He is the best teacher ever!), seemed very happy about that too. It was also my French teacher's birthday today, so I bought her Entenmann's Cake during lunch recess lol. She was really happy that I had remembered her birthday, and ate it all :D. I guess my day wasn't so bad after all...

Anyway, till next time,
Gen :D"

"event","I have lots of homework to do this weekend. I have to start researching for my LaGuardia essay, research for my website on Arthur Ashe, and make a study guide for my history test next week. Lots to do, I can't wait. Oh by the way, my weight-training is going great. I'm not aching anymore, and my muscles are a lot bigger. I know it sounds like I'm crazy since I've only been doing this for a week, but I'm not. I can really feel the difference. Anyway, back to school tomorrow, another weight-training class."

"event","Yesterday I had my first weight-training class in school. Man, that instructor really pushes you to your limits! (Probably because he was a former Olympic weight-lifter lol.) Anyway, I'm so sore I could hardly move my arms (We only do upper body exercises on Mondays). Next class is on Thursday, and I'm not sure what's coming up, but I can't wait!"

"event","I'm bored. I can't wait to go back to school on Monday, when I will have my first weight-training class. Many people wish they didn't have school, but they're crazy! Life would be soo boring without school! I'm bored every weekend. I mean, I like having the break, but we had a four-day weekend this week! Staying home just makes me lazy....

"event","Hi everyone! Happy Thanksgiving! Anyway, didn't do much today, just got to relax a bit and have a break from school. Anyway, that's what Thanksgiving is all about, isn't it? In the morning, I watched the Macy*s Thanksgiving Parade on TV. Then, I just took a nap and had turkey for lunch, and turkey for dinner. I'm probably gonna be having turkey every day for the next week. Anyway, Happy Gobble Gobble Day!

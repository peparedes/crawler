"event","i'm going to grand rapids this weekend. i feel a little uneasy about it and i dont know why. but i've been wanting to go for a while so i might as well. i've only been back once since i moved away at the tender age of 8.

my mom was here this weekend. it was a little strange having her here because i guess i'm just so used to doing my own thing now. 

i am a little disappointed with myself lately. i feel like i'm becoming something that i never saw myself being. i've always considered myself a pretty nice person, but lately i feel like maybe i have never been. sometimes i wonder how others see me. i'm really not that nice. sometimes things come out of my mouth and i feel like it's so unlike me. sometimes i try so hard to sound smart or clever or funny so people will like me. i dont even know what i'm doing. i just sound stupid most of time anyway. 

people tell me i'm so photogenic but then they tell me that i dont really look like myself in pictures. what is that supposed to mean? what do i look like in real life?"

it's been an entire year since we broke up. can someone tell me why i'm still feeling like crap about it?! i have no doubt in my mind that we weren't right for eachother. in fact, i was infinitely relieved when we broke up. but i guess that doesn't mean i dont care about him. the thing is, i dont know if i really care that much, or if i'm just missing the way i used to care SO much. i feel like i'm just holding on to a memory of when i was crazy about him, because we had such a good time. i know it's over now, but i dont want to forget about it! but that doesn't mean i'm in love with him or anything! or that i'm not happy because i dont have someone new! i'm so happy! i'm having a great time at school, and i wouldn't trade it for anything. it just really pisses me off that he doesn't want to talk to me, see me, or even acknowledge that i exist.  it's not like i have a burning desire to hang out with him, but i just feel like whether i like it or not, a little piece of me still with him. just a little 'hi' once in a while would make it so much better. i do miss him. i miss the way we used to feel about eachother, and i know it's gone, but it hurts that he doesn't seem to want to remember that it ever existed. i dont expect him to go out of his way to see me or talk to me. if i talk to him more than once a month or so he really gets on my nerves anyway. i feel like he thinks that somehow i am not okay, like i'm mentally unstable or something. the last time i saw him he just looked at me with this puppy dog look and kept asking me if i was okay. OF COURSE I'M OKAY! if i sounded unhappy at all this semester, it might have had something to do with the fact that i moved across the country by myself and it takes some time to adjust! it's not that i'm pining after him! good lord! i guess i'm mostly just mad at myself for being so upset about it. i dont understand why it upsets me so much! i didn't want to see him last night either! so why is it so upsetting that he didn't want to see me?! it was a stupid highschool relationship. i'm not even an adult, i dont know anything about life or love. why am i making it into such drama? how can 2 small years out of the 18 that i've lived have such an effect on me, and why are they still effecting me when i thought i had more or less moved on? maybe i really am emotionally unstable. AGHHHHHHHH

the thing is, is that i really have been so happy lately. i'm so thankful for all the amazing people i've met in chicago, and all the amazing friends i have here in tucson. i love you guys! i'm so lucky to know you."

i'm so excited to leave school for a while this weekend, but i really wish i was going home. oh well, i think i will have fun at katie's house. i think i'll be spending most of this weekend doing homework anyway. i have to read a rather lengthy book called ""Jesus and the Rise of Early Christianity"" and then write a paper for bible. i'll be so glad when this semester is over and then i dont have to do homework for a whole month!!!"

it was also nice to come back to chicago, because i realized that i've made some wonderful friends here. meghan and melanie came to pick me up at the airport just so they could ride back with me on the L. when i got back to my room i found that katie had decorated it and made me a welcome home mix cd. i've never had anyone decorate my room for me before! it made me feel wonderful that she did that when i was only gone for a day!
last night instead of doing homework i went to jewel and target, and tonight instead of doing homework i watched bridget jones. i am so terrible! i'm so behind, but i can't seem to make myself do my work. i dont know what's wrong with me.
oh, and i also learned a great deal about deer hunting tonight at dinner. fascinating subject.

marissa did my nails tonight. they look so pretty! get excited guys! i'm going to chipotle this weekend!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","ugh i have so much homework to do and i was going to work all day and now it is night time and i have done nothing! oh well. i cleaned my room and i got a hug from a very cute boy. which made me really happy. and i just want to say that i love april and kayla because lately i have been spending more time in their room than in my own. 
last night was very... interesting. katie, sarah, and I had a little bonding experience. we all shaved our legs together in one of our little shower sized ""bathtubs"" and then we all got in still wearing our clothes and just sat tangled up together under the running water. people thought we were crazy... and we were but it was a lot of fun."

"event","it's friday! i slept til ten this morning took a 30 second shower and ran to my class. this week has been amazing. i only had to get up before 9 one day. on wednesday night we had a major dance party in katie's room for her birthday and then blindfolded her and brought her to a surprise party right outside anderson. we all ate cake in the cold in the middle of the night. it was so much fun. 
the boy i think is cute is in the newspaper this week so i dont even have to use stalker tactics to get his picture! 
tonight is the first choir concert and i'm hella excited. except our dresses are really ugly and we had to pay a lot of money for them. mine is way too long and i dont have anyone to hem it for me so i'm just going to be tripping all over the place. i wish you guys could be there to see it!
tomorrow is homecoming and i'm excited. 
oh and they had cookie dough ice cream in the machine at the cafeteria today! this is the most random entry ever."

"event","it's finally fall break! which is only three days, but i'm still greatly relieved.  i only wish i was coming home for the weekend! it's alright. i'm going home with katie on saturday and we're going to shop for homecoming outfits! and i'm going downtown tomorrow. i haven't been downtown in a long time. not since school started kicking my ass. 
last night i found out that i went to preschool with one of my friends here and i didn't even know it! crazy."

"event","today i went to bible class and as i was sitting down i heard ""hello angela robinson."" i turned and it was joel so i said ""hi joel johnson."" and then i sat with him. he didnt speak to me for the first 2 months of school and then all of a sudden last friday he says hi to me and tells his friend that i was his ""bathtub buddy."" (scandalous). he looks almost exactly the same as he used to, except a whole lot taller.
i feel like all of my worlds are colliding in this place. i've always divided my life and the people i know into categories: chicago, michigan, minnesota, and arizona. here there are people from every era of my life. it's messing with my brain. but it also makes me feel like i belong because some of the kids here i've known since i was 2.
boys boys boys. i kind of want to have a date to the homecoming dance which is going to be held at the institute of modern art (sweet!). i have one week to find someone. well, i've already found him, but i have one week to make him ask me....i really need a camera so i can show you all pictures of the cute boys."

"event","what a day. 
i slept late and then found out my best friend is getting married! holy cow. i need to start meeting guys. i feel so behind.
i went to the library and tried to do homework, but all i could do was stare out the window at this beautiful october day. the air was perfectly crisp today and i loved it. kayla and i watched some high school boys skateboarding and smoking cigarettes on the steps.  then on the way back for dinner we saw a boy fall off his skateboard and practically break his ankle. it was so sad to watch him trying not to cry. i'm glad my little brother wears all his padding when he skateboards, even if he does look like a nerd.
dinner in the ARA was nasty tonight. so i came back and ate a lot of cookies and ice cream. you just have to do it sometimes. 
then we watched kill bill and my roommate was totally disturbed. i love that movie.
people here are making fun of me because i act weird sometimes. meh.
i saw the cute boy twice today and he gave me a high five. awww."

"event","i fall in love with every boy that speaks to me who is remotely good looking. isn't that pathetic? why can't i just stop thinking about it? i always end up depressed or heart broken in the end. i need to be thinking about the language of biblical prophecy and french literature and stuff like that. but not boys. never boys.

BUT HE'S SO CUTE!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHH!"

"event","yesterday, i went to the planetarium.  i haven't been to a planetarium since i was in about 3rd grade! it was pretty cool. i felt like a little kid playing with all the displays and the show i saw was really neat. chicago has so many cool things to do. i want to go on a date with someone and just walk downtown and see all the fountains and stuff. it's a beautiful place.
i've been so busy this week! it's the worst. i have my astronomy midterm on friday (because that class only lasts a quarter) but i'm going to be so happy when i'm done with that class. i'll be able to sleep until 11 almost every day! 
this weekend i'm going home with my roommate. she lives like an hour away from here. i'm really excited because i will finally be able to take a bath! dorm living is fun because my friends are so close, but the bathrooms SUCK. i seriously can't wait to go home for a month at xmas and have a bathroom that i only share with two other people. and where i dont have to wear shoes in the shower."

"event","i should be doing homework right now... but i'm not. i practiced and now i feel all accomplished, but i really didn't even get that much done and i have a lesson tomorrow. 
today i got up and excersized. then i went to astronomy lab, to bible, and to work. after work i went to dinner at cooper's apartment with christy. it was fun. we ate taco meat in pitas because we had no tortillas or taco shells. then we had some good coffee. 
i dont know why i'm writing all this. i've never really written an entry about what i did in a day before so i thought i'd give it a try. it's really not all that interesting, but it was nice to write it so i dont care if you guys read it or not! 
now i should go do some work."

"event","Cheena, do you remember that time we were going to enter an essay contest so we could win money for burritos? (I believe we were going to enter with the last name Lobinson...) and we calculated in our heads how many burritos 5,000 dollars would be worth? well, somehow this notion stuck with me, and to this day whenever i spend money, or see a dollar amount, my head always calculates how many burritos that could have been worth.
For example, today i spent almost a hundred dollars on books for my french class, and i looked at my reciept and found that the tax was $7.42. the first thing that came into my head was, ""that's one burrito i'll never get to eat!"" and then it occured to me that i might be one of the only people that thinks things like that and that cheena would probably appreciate it.
i haven't had chipotle since i got here. i just think it wouldn't be the same without alana spoon feeding it to me."

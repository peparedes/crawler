Guys suck. Most of them anyway. Talked to Andrew today. The only reason I told him was because I figured maybe he cared. Maybe he really did. Maybe he didn't. Hope he really did. But how am I supposed to know how his brain works? I can't. But Idk. Getting ready to leave Kaytie's soon and go homee. Gotta call Ron and Andrew. But I am getting a prettie extensive bill for long distance lately. So I do the let it ring one time and then they call you back thing so I don't need to pay for it. =D heh. Yepyep that me.

"event","I really don't understand guys. They confuse the living hell out of me. They say hold on I'll be right back and then go away and NEVER come back and make you feel like you're not worth anyone's time. Then they tell you that they like you; as more than a friend. Then they don't talk to you for days. They say that they are there for you when you need them and then they aren't. I don't like them. They suck. They hurt feelings and just don't help anything. With the exception of a few. With a few being 3 people that I know of. and thats not a whole lot. I Don't really get it. I don't get why they will say something if they don't really mean it. And why they will make empty promises becuase they just hurt more. They really suck and it's not right to lead anybody on. If you don't want to be lead on, don't do the leading yourself. And if you really only like someone  little bit more than a friend, don't get their hopes up that there might be some sort of something between the two of you. Becuase then they will just be very hurt//sad//upset//angry with you. Then don't tell them you want to hang out with them, but take no initiative what so ever to get together with them. That hurts too. You may not realize that you're hurting someone while you're doing it, but you should think about what affect you're going to have on them in the long run. Because it sucks to be hurt by someone that you trust//like//maybe even love. It really does. So think about what you're doing next time, jerkface. Okay? I don't want to have to have this conversation again. Because there are very few people up to cry to at 2:18am. So think about. Okay? sound good? I HOPE SO. And people get tired of YOU hurting THEM! So STOP IT. Before I have to give you a swift kick to the head....Or maybe even the testicles. I won't even give it a second thought. If you hurt me again, I am kicking you in the fucking balls. Count on it, asshole. I hate you now. Not really becuase i could never ever hate you as hard as i could try. So I think that you should just appologize for what you've done. And I am sure that you don't even realize what you've done to me right now, But you definately are hurting my feelings with what you are doing to me. So I just felt like I should let you know that right now.  So stop hurting me. Before I have to hurt you. Physically. Not emotionally like you did me.

"event","Well...I know that not many people do LJ anymore...but I felt like making something new. I was reading my old one last night, but I don't remember my password and the email it is under is no longer in existance. So I have started a new one. This week was a week home with my grandma while my parentals were in FA with the nephew and neice. I don't have much to say except that I really don't sleep much anymore. I tend to stay awake later and later just thinking about stuff...There's not much else to do around here.

I am technically moved out of the DUNDALK vicinity for good now. Which really sucks becuase I love it there. I really hated to leave. 

I have new friends at my new school. 

I have also made a new friend who shall be known as ""Uncle Rick"". He knows who he is. I really think he is totally awesome and I am really glad that he's a new friend of mine. Nobody that I know knows him, cept my sister.

I am technically single. Yep thats right. 

I am really bored. The last time I updated my old LJ was August 1st, 2005. So it hasn't been a year, but darn near close to it. I like my user picture. I will probably get ragged on for it becuase of the very protective siblings that I have. But I love them anyway. 

I think thats all for right now. Maybe an update later on then. Goodniight Goodnight..."

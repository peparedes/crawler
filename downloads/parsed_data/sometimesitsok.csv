Some children laughed I'd fall for certain
For thinking that I'd last forever
But I knew exactly where I was 

And I knew the meaning of it all
And I knew the distance to the sun
And I knew the echo that is love
And I knew the secrets in your spires
And I knew the emptiness of youth
And I knew the solitude of heart
And I knew the murmurs of the soul
And the world is drawn into your hands
And the world is etched upon your heart
And the world so hard to understand
Is the world you can't live without

And I knew the silence of the world"

Jon and I went to go to Pearl Paint but we went to 579 Mass Ave, Boston instead of 579 Mass Ave, Cambridge. It was annoying beause we were in Roxbury and it was cold. But we ended up going to Utrecht anyways and it probably costed the same. So now I'm gessoing my canvas for Will Barnet's painting: ""Dawn"". I get to do it tomorrow.

Then back to sabrinas where we almost watched the whole movie- Requiem For a Dream, but I was really tired and my feet were wet from the snow so I just wanted to go to sleep. So jon and I walked Claudia home in the SNOW and then headed back over here, jon's room, and i slept til like 1. not enough though, i couldn't sleep too well. Elsie called me today, she and Brian might come down to visit. I'm expecting a phone call from Ellie tonight, and hopefully she'll be around Boston, then we can hang out.

So now I'm just waiting for Jon to get out of the shower so that we can go back out in the snow over to my place and I can take a shower. That will be nice :)

My grandfather is in the hospital. My family has been a mess lately kind of, I can't tell if it only seems that way because I'm not around or just because it's a bad season. All I want is for everyone to be alright. I might pray.

<P>I&nbsp;watched Almost Famous last night with Tim and Melissa and Claudia and Katie and Jon and me. Alex went home for the weekend. I'm at Jon's and he's getting ready so that I can go get ready for Ellie's grandfather's show today in Beverly, Mass. which should be fun. I think the RedSox game is tonight, and we're all going to hang out with Sabrina tonight I believe. And I get to see my parents today! I'm a little out of it but I feel alright. Call me on my cell if anyone wants to chill.</P>

<P>i feel dead though. i just left the room for the first time after i took a shower and such, and i went down to put my laundry in and now i feel like i just hiked katahdin. and! i took the elevator!!!! jesus i'm out of it. </P>

"event","So i went home this weekend. It was awesome to see my family and elsie and brian. I came back yesterday with my parents and Jon and we went to Brookline and had Vietnamese food for lunch, it was really delish. Now I'm just working on mypaper that's due tomorrow, even though we don't have class! It's for my Art History class that's about pre-hispanic america, and the class was cancelled because of Columbus Day! hahahaha, i thought that was pretty funny. yea, so my job situation sucks and i'm gonna go into fin.aid office tomorrow and talk to them to see if I can get stuff figured out. I NEED MONEY SO BAD! but for now i'm good i think, i need to take a shower soon. i'm gonna go finish the paragraph i'm on now and then probably take a shower. 

jon- i love you like claudia loves hats"

"event","Free from the torment of sin
All this I'm giving up
Much as the sun would decide to give in
Explode into orange
And hear all the voices sing praise with hymns
Mark the birth of a change
Free from the torment of sin
All this I'm giving up

It's not me
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me so who am I now

Over and over again
Light with a sharpened edge 
Cut through the black empty space we call sky
Beginning the cycle that stays
And I know in my heart we all die
Like the day and the night
Like the sun in the sky
All this I'm giving up

It's not me
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me so who am I now?

Is there another side?
Beyond the black and the white
Place I could meet you by
A place on the other side
I'll let you know when I go
When I'm gone

It's not me 
Buried wreckage my soul
It's not me so who am I now?"

I'm really excited to see my family and Kath's new apartment and hang out with Mosh.

i catch myself getting sad and i don't really like it. i have't cried for a long time though. i liked all the stimulation at first but now it's all becoming normal and the change is quite difficult. oh well.

"event","It's sunday night and I'm alone. Katie isn't back yet from Maine and Alex and Claudia went to play volleyball at Emanuel. I've been trying to read but it's difficult. This weekend was fun: Friday we dyed our hair! and hung out at Skeets' house. Saturday we went to the museum and saw 'Dragonflies, the baby cries' and 'Nosferatu' which were both pretty sweet. And I met Sabrina who's really nice, she's in Claud's film class. We went to Prudential and Copley and dreamed about being rich. Then Jon and Claud and I came back and watched 'Jay and Silent Bob Stike Back' until 4:00 (bad idea). But I have to say that the best part of the whole weekend was that I got to sleep in my bed with Jon both nights! Even though it was a little small. I can feel Fall. Ellie - I downloaded In Love and Death if you want to copy it sometime, but only if you copy blink for me. It's cold in here. So I guess that's all I've got to say. Back to school tomorrow. Oil Painting all day. Hope everyone is great. 

Cheers"

existing to tell the tales of letting go
and now we're strangled to tears on the fallback farewell 
its all in our heads 
the faint whispers
i tried to tell myself when its already over
that the reasons found decoys
and this is holding me back
as if to say what you thought you heard
i wish i did
i don't want to feel this pull as this city becomes home without you"

"event","so i've got a story for you....

i was in my drawing class today and our teacher decided to invite a performing art class into our class so that we could document their performances through drawing. so there were about ten people in the performance all doing their own things all at the same time. Some of them were tying string everywhere, some were making coffee and putting paper in their cup, some were doing the hoola-hoop, and one guy was walking around like an old homeless man with a cup of coffee and a bagel. he started pouring coffee onto peoples paper and smudging the bagel on the paper, it was really retarded but we all got over it after a few minutes just because performance art is so ""special"" (psht). anyways, after a while of all this stuff going on and the smell of coffee slowly becoming grosser and grosser the old homeless guy put another table on top of the one i was sitting at (they're little drawing tables) and started looking at his coffee and like lining it up and measuring it with his hands and eyes. i was trying to sharpen my charcoal when suddenly i heard a smash and there was coffee allllllllllllllllllllllll over me. my hair was soaking, my shirt was drenched and it was in my ear and on my face on my right side. i was completely speachless and just left because i wasn't about to ""interfere with the art"" but i was so fucking mad!!!!!!!!! ahhh!!!!!!! and then i couldn't just leave so i stayed all dried up coffee like for the rest of the class and when the guy was finally out of his character he was like ""did i hurt you?"" i said "" no but i got soaking wet"" and he was like ""oh, i don't really care, just as long as i didn't hurt you"" AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! snarl.







hope everyone had a better day then me!"

"event","i went to the Metric show last night with Claudia, Alex, John, and Jon and it was awesome. I had such a great time, and I got their set list! And John ripped these stickers out of the guitartist's jacket!!!! yay! 

but we didn't get to bed until late so that was kinda bad. I woke up and after i got out of the shower, katie yelled ""hey guys? does anyone know where the fire extiguisher is?"" and alex like ran in. the microwave was on fire because katie didn't know you can't put metal in the microwave and she was heating up tea so the tea bag caught fire. alex put it out with the extinguisher and there was that green dust shit everywhere. but we were already all late for class so we had to leave. but we cleaned up after.

i have to go back to painting class in a little bit. I started a still life oil painting. it's fun actually! i'm so tired though......



i love you jon!

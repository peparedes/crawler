I don't like Alex anymore. Why? Because every girl flirts with him, and every girl gets flirted with by him, and watching him and Liz every day at his locker...blugh! It's disgusting, it's a bit like a milder Emily and Ethan. It's very yuck, and I'm done with him. Yes, I changed my crushes twice int he past 2 months, it's kinda a shocker after liking Zack and only Zack all year last year. I kinda like it. 

Do you ever flirt with a guy, and then think about what it would be like to have him as a boyfriend, even if you didn't like him? Maybe you don't, but I do. I think Haze might be onto something about what she said about Jimmy today. T, since you don't know, I'll tell. He always talks to me, most of the time it's about the OC, which is funny giggle, because he a guy....and he likes the OC. Hah. Anyway, he said to me today in the hall ""Hope, the OC comes on tonight!"" and I said ""Yeah, I'm so excited!!!"" And then he goes ""yup"" and Haze said, ""You guys would make a good couple"". It was kinda random, but...eh, whatever. Those kind of things stick with you all day, so I got thinking about what it wouldbe like to have him as boyfriend. But most of the time, all we talk about is the OC, now what kind of relationship is that?

We've got a good amount of homework, but I'll do it all tomorrow night cos it's all due Monday. 

Han, I'm sorry about Gordo. I love you, and I too know it wil get better. ""Things can only go up""+my grandpa

Hopefully Grace and I will be doing something Saturday. And if we do, we'l be journeying to Salvation Army, then watching movies at my house. Fun!

I'm glad Haze is happy about liking Dan, I'm happy she does. He's a good crush to have, Haze. He isn't all sad all the time about nothing, no offence to Evan. And, I don't hate Evan, I insult him, but I don't hate him. 

My mom got her nose pierced Tuesday night, and I almost passed out. It was very steryl and all,b ut the room we were in was packed full of neeldes, and doctors office like things, and little clipper looking things, and it all made me woozy, and then the next thing I know, my sister is putting me in a chair. Haha, it ws funny, when you walk in, on the door, there's a no religious people sign. Well, it didn't say that exactly, it had a picture of a little boy and girl carrying bibles and a cross. 
Hahahahahaha.

I dressed all in black today because of the election. Wearing a shirt that said, ""Not My President"", meaning, I hate Bush's fuckin guts, and he should die. Hehe. I'm evil. 

I saw Eem-yoo today a lot, and I really hope he say my shirt. Because he was being an ass last night online. He hates me. Why? I stpped being mean to him, and now he's being a total dickhead. What the fuck is his problem?

I'll close with something happy, 
I got the ""Most Stylish"" award in Cross Country. Woo!"

"event","For 2 days now, we have been summerless. Which totally fuckin sucks. But I'm doing the best I can.
I really did not want to go back. I was going around the hoiuse slamming things down and pouting and stomping my feet when I walked. So finally, my mom told me to go and make a mix tape and chill out. So I did, with all of my favorite songs of the moment on it. I cried while I made it, knowing that summer was over, and I have 10 months until I am once again free of it all. 
The next morning I woke up at 7, the usual time, and did all of the things I do before school every other day; wake up, shower, get dressed, put on make up, do hair, put on jewelry, eat, leave. It was raining, so the hair that I had spent a while scrunching, was flat before I even had left the house.
We got to school and I waited for the bell to ring and went inside. The hall was chaotic, and all the little 7th graders were being idiots. 
So the day went on. There were new kids. Oh my god. Last year before school ended I said ""maybe next year we'll have a new kid who has sexy long hair, and likes music, and is gorgeous!!"" Well, I predicted well. Sidney Dunn. Holy mother. He's cute,and has long hair and the most gorgeous eyes. They're like, aqua. I spend most of period 8/9 staring at him. We want to adopt him, but sorta took the wrong approach. So, we'll try again some other time. Give it a couple of weeks or so.
We started X-Country practice. It's pretty brutal, but it'll get better. Mrs. A is really excited that I'm doing it this year,so that's awesome.
Went to the Football game today with Lacey. To kill about an hour or so before the game though, we went to CVS and bought some cool shit. Then she and Kelly took me to lunch st Subway. It was grand. 

Yeah, it's definitly a new year. I'm starting over, as a new person, someone confident and open to new opportunities. I'm pretty much over Zack, despite the past few days of Hannah's constant nagging. But since I am a new person, and want to do things different this year, I'm not going back to him. I can't there's too much history. Plus, that was last year, not this year.  
My dad has a new job, so he's pretty much starting over. But the sucky thing is, he'll be working 4-11 or 12, which sucks, because it's at night. And I won't really see him much. But we get more money, so that's cool."

"event","It's only been a couple days, but I haven't told you how my trip went, and intead of telling everyone the same story like, a billion times, I'll just tell it right here. 
I had to wake up early on Saturday *igh*. But, of course, it was for a good cause, I got to see my Kristie Lee!!
We all rose early in the morning, got our shit together, and chatted with my Grandmother for what seemed like eternity, but was only like, 30 minutes. After we did all that, we made like a tree and leaf(ed). 
The car ride seemed like it took longer than it usually does, because my mother made us go through North Adams to some stupid Waverly Fabric place. It was in this old factory thing, and it was hotter than blue blazes, and after we wasted an hour there, instead of used it to make better time for R.I, we got nothing. I slept pretty much the rest of the way there. 
We got to the house around 2, and Kristie and I walked to WalMart so I could buy myself a toothbrush because my parents, who usually grab it for me, didn't pack my toothbrush. It was so friggin hot, and we had a good half mile to walk too. I was weating so bad that the whole back of my shirt was like, soaking wet from sweat. I usually don't sweat that bad:-[. But I got my 79 cent toothbrush (which cut my gums:-() and some awesome eyeliner. 
Later that night we went and babysat for these people, who pay us a lot of money, which rocks. The kids were fairly good, but the daughter had 2 girlfriends over and the little brother was supposed to go to a friends house to sleepover, and his friend cancelled so he sat in his room and cried all night. Kristie doesn't take any shit, so she went in and was like ""stop being a mope and come out and have a good time with us"". He didn't, but that's ok, we had fun without him. I tried to do all the things that my babysitters used to do with me. We watched Cheaper By The Dozen, ate pizza, danced to music, and Kristie and I did the girls' makeup. 
It was a good time. Their parents came home around 12:30 and took us home. We immediatly fell aslep, running after kids all day tires you out. *shruggs*
The next day we went to Newport, where all the rich people live, and the ocean is all around you. On our way some guy came out in front of my cousin Debbie's car and she was following her husband, (Kristie's dad) Ed. The guy gave Deb the finger and Deb started swearing at him, ""you fuckin asshole, you're gonna pay you dickhead."" She got on her cell phone and caled up Ed. She told him there was an asshole in front of her, and to go like, 10 miles an hour or something ridiculas. And he did. It was so funny. Ed went like, 20 mph, and even waited a little while before going at the red light. It rocked!
We went downtown (in Newport) to all those little stores that bring in lots of money from tourists and the locals. I bought a pair of jelly shoes, presents for the girls, a Leona Naess cd,a tank top on sale at Gap, and carrier oil for my aromatherapy burner.
I witnessed 2 potential fights while I was there. One int he parking lot. There was an old guy who was going to back into a parking space right next to us, and this young pinhead guy and his family come in with their volvo, and pinhead says to old man, ""HEY! HEY! THAT'S MY SPACE!"" And Old Guy says, ""No"" and Pinhead says, ""YES IT IS  DICKHEAD!"" Old Guy proceeds to pull into the space and Pinhead honks his horn and yells ""HEY! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? I'M PARKING THERE!"" And my mom comes around the corner from Panera and says to Pinhead, ""we're leaving"" and points to our car. Pinhead, instead of thanking us says ""Good! That guy's a shit head."" I felt bad for Old Guy, and wanted to slap Pinhead. The second potential fight I was was on some tiny back-street while we were leaving the town. A family crosses the street and some guy in a BMW comes tearin around the corner and almost hits them. The daddy guy of the family says ""Slow down"" and mr.BMW stops his car, IN THE ROAD!, and says ""You a local?"" And mr. Daddy says ""Yeah"" and mr. BMW says, ""Yeah, me too, I know the speed limit."" And mr. Daddy keeps walking down the road and mr. BMW follows him and they're fighting while mr. BMW is driving and mr. Daddy walks. 
Then we went to The Pointe, which is a spot ont he ocean with all these rocks that you can climb, and a huge compass looking thing at the top of a hill where you park your car. Kristie and I climbed around on the rocks, and got splashed when the huge waves came and hit the rocks. I ran around, feeling free, and wished that I could stay there all the time, forever and ever, because, even though I was on the water, on the slippery rocks, I felt safe and free. But we had to go, because Debbie's knee was hurting her. 
We got back to the house and Kristie and me and Debbie went to go and take car of Kristie's horse, Tobey, and Ed and my parents stayed home and started a little fire outside. Aftyer we went to feed the horses we went to Dave's, the grocery store, to get stuff for s'mores. I had on my new sexy cute tankie top from Gap that I got that day and the jeans that make me look tall and skinny and my sunglasses and my hair up all whispy. There was this cute boy sitting on the grocerie carts, and I decided to have a little bit of fun. So I loked over at him, did my pouty lips, tooky of my sunglasses sexily and looked out at him. His fuckin jaw dropped and his eyes widened like ""DAMN!"" It was great. But it kinda scared me so I didn't look at him again. 
That night Kristie and I went for a run, which I'm not going to talk about, and we ordered this GREAT pizza and all sat around the fire and talked about meaningless shit. I feel so great around those people. They are pretty much what I live for, making me feel so free and happy when I'm around them, because they're hillarious.
We left the next mroning and my mom again draged us to some stupid place. The outlets in some town, I can't recall the name of it,...Rentham or something. I was tired and cranky, so I was a little bitch the whole time, but after I had a Del's iced slush thing, I felt aaaaaaaaaaall better. Then I got a thumb ring and a cool watch. 
Now I'm home, and have 1 and a half days to school. Which makes me soooo mad. 
But, anyway..."

I'm very confused with Zack. He never shuts up when I talk toh im. H'es the first one to say hi and then after hi, he never shuts up. It's annoying kinda. It can only make one wonder...hmmm.

I just wanna impress my family. Because my dad's side of the family is so competetive. He wants me to go to a college on full scolarship. Fat chance. But my mom told me that he is only in competition with his family, and not to worry, at least I am doing my best. 
I have to study for my tests next week. Every night I am staying after to study. But then there's the homework. Ah, life's joyous curve balls. You want summer, you can have it, but you have to work for it first. 
Hm, I haven't seen Lace all week. I have to see her!!
Something happened in the hall today. I went up and hugged Jon, that's something I do everyday. And Hillary said ""Oh my god, Jon are you going out with Hope??"" It's scary when I think about it. He's just my friend. I know I could never like Jon because he is just...Jon. 



Dear Hazel,
I care so much, I hope you realize that. I hate me for telling (I was with Hannah) but it is something that cannot go unmentioned. We love you so much. Not talking to Evan is perhaps a good thing, but then it is not so good, parents know what's best for you. To quote Almost Famous, ""They(I'm changing she to they) mean well"". 
Love you!!!!

Then when the play was over, I went and found Gracie Loo and gave her hugs and for like 10 minutes we were all crazy like, then I went and found Hannah and T and I hung out with them for a while. Then T left and Hannah and Jon and I hung out for a while over on this bench in the baseball field. Then I look to see my parents, and they're driving down the road. I was like ""MY PARENTS FORGOT ME!!!!!"" I ran after the car yelling ""I GOTTA GO!! MY PARENTS FORGOT ME!! WAIT FOR MEEEEEEEEEE!"" It was fun. Then I got to the car and they said ""oh, we thought you were down at Grandma's car."" Well, they were wrong. I'm going tomorrow night too.

Alrighty, to start off, I have done my homework every single time all year round this is the first time I haven't done it all year, well I did it, just never showed her, the bitch. Then in class she said ""see me after class"" I was like, sh-alright. When I got spoken to after class, she said to me ""you tune me out and make htis class your own."" !?!?!?!?!?!?!? What the hell is she talking about!? I was like ""um, what?"" and she said ""you don't seem to listen to me, then you don't pay attention."" what the hell. I said ""I don't understand"" she said ""you did it wednesday."" I was listening on Wednesday. Same as every other day, listen to her be stupid, do the god damn work, and don't talk to her, cos she hates me.

My probelm is, that Hazel claims I'm her shadow. Well, uh, not really, but sorta. Last year, Haze and I became friends because I liked the same music and was listening to...something, and she wanted to hear too. So, I let her listen, and then through the year, I kinda copied her, but as it went on, I started to acually get interested in it. And I'm not saying that some of the stuff she does now I don't not copy her. Like, for example, uh, writing, I have ALWAYS wanted to be a writer, and this year, I became more and more interested in it. The red chuck's thing, my parents told me that they were going to get me a pair for valentines day but didn't, and ever since, I wanted a pair, now she has one and I can't get em. Uh,...The jeans cuffed to capri's, I had forgotten I used to do that last year, then I tried it, and she got mad cos she had done it the previouse day. Perks, she told me I should read it!! So thats not my faukt. White Oleander, same thing as Perks. I found The Pogues on my own, and liked em, uuuuuuh, and I thought that she didn;t know them, and she said they rock and I was like ""D'OH!!!"" Uh, Crowded House, got them mixed up with another band, so, nah, I don't know em. 
Ok, I'm gonna stop, cos she isn't even gonna bother reading this.

Last night was so much fun. I got to go and see all my cousins, who i have not seen since like, Christmas. Cody (younger cousin= 2 years apart) is an alright kid. When he isn't around many other people, he is cool. I hung with him for part of the night. We shared a piece of cake, then he wrote on me with a purple marker, and his mom took it away. Then, there is my little cousin Hazel, she is 6, and she used to be so annoying, now, all I wanna do it hug her! I have promised her that when I am old enough to drive, I will take her to the movies, and shopping, and I will give her pep talks on boys and other such useful information on living and being a person. The whole reason I got to see all my cousins andfamily members last night was because we were celebrating my cousin Isaac's 5th birthday and his brother Eli's 4th birthday. Those two are so frickin cute. I could also just hug them.
After that, we came home. My uncle (me mums brother who lives right down our long driveway) was clearing a part of the woods out to make his ""garage"", I don't think he'll even get that done. But anyway, he was having some awfully fun people over (and mind you it was about 9 at night) for a bonfire. Acually, they were already there. So, as soon as we got home, I threw on some clothes that I would not mind to smell like smoke and trotted down to see what was going on. I hadn't seen these people since his wedding in September. I stayed till I couldn't stand my aunts friend and then left to go home. The night was so clear, and warm. I wanted to bottle it all up and keep it for a nasty yucky night when I needed the nice-ness. 
Poor T got her braces on Thursday:-(. She says her mouth hurts really bad, so, I must get her something nice to chew on, like a baby toy:-p. 
I spent most of the day down at my Grandma's apartment at Cynthia Meadows. We watched While You Were Out and Trading Spaces. And we ate oranges, and cottage cheese(seperate)
I think the thing I had for Jared has passed. I hope it has.I hope it was just a one day only thing. Unfortunatly, this Zack thing hasn't gone away. Its making me mad, I just want to stop liking him, he isn't a good crush to have. Then there is the Brown crush. I talked to him Friday night. I think I just want him as a friend. He is a good friend to have. 
Holy cow, this was a long one!!"

I was being very bad about flirting and got myself in a bad situation. That situation being...I am now attracted to Jared Kirk *screams*. Dah, whatever. I was doing a BAD job of covering it up tho, because I was getting annoying and way to excited. It was a 4 hour bus ride, to and from. I can't explain it, because all the people that read this were there, and I do a better job of teling you in person. Ok, yeah, so, I am out of words, sooooo, bye bye."

She comes in colors everywhere; 
She combs her hair 
She's like a rainbow 
Combing colors in the air 
Oh, everywhere 
She comes in colors 

She comes in colors everywhere; 
She combs her hair 
She's like a rainbow 
Combing colors in the air 
Oh, everywhere 
She comes in colors 

Have you seen her dressed in blue
See the sky in front of you 
And her face is like a sail 
Speck of white so fair and pale 
Have you seen the lady fairer

She comes in colors everywhere; 
She combs her hair 
She's like a rainbow 
Combing colors in the air 
Oh, everywhere 
She comes in colors 

Have you seen her all in gold
Like a queen in days of old 
She shoots colors all around 
Like a sunset going down 
Have you seen the lady fairer

She comes in colors everywhere; 
She combs her hair 
She's like a rainbow 
Combing colors in the air 
Oh, everywhere

When it comes to crushes, I get so freakin stupid, and head over heals, and all waded up with it, and I need to stop. like, its all that's on my mind!!! GRRRR! I guess that I just need to grow up and take everything into concideration and all that junk. Like, when I'm online, all my friends and I talk about is boys, and liek, when I try to change the subject, like what else is there to talk about right? Like, every other subject is so boring. I say I have better things to do than talk about boys, but I really do want to talk about boys, all the time. 
Whatever right? You don't care.

"event","it's been like, a week. I've been kinda busy. I've had OM every day this week, and I have homework, and whenever I am online, I never even think of coming on and updating. 
*sigh* Things with ""the man"" have not been too great. First, I find out that i'm annoying him, and he wants me to stop liking him, so that resulted to me ignoring him, well, not talking t him online, I would only talk to him if he started talking to me. Then he told me why I annoy him and stuff, it all ended well. But then, (Hannah, please don' get mad at me) the next day at school, Hannah was saying how she was so happy. She wouldn't tell me and said that I would get mad if I knew, but I pressured her to tell me. I knew it had something to do with a boy, and this boy was Zack. Apparantly, she likes Zack, and he likes her, but only ""a little but"". I'm not pissed/mad, I'm just really...shocked. I'm also kinda hurt. I mean, I like Zack so much, and it's just like....there's competition now, and he wants her and she wants him, and I am just the freind who likes him so much more than she will. It's like those tv shows when two girls like one guy, and the guy picks the one who doesn't like him as much as the other one does. Crazy.
She said that they aren't going to go out because 1.) he doesn't want to hate her, and 2.) they don't want me to hate them. And I wouldn't hate them, but it would totally kill me if they went out. I would feel so incredibly betrayed and hurt,...agh. 

On the bright side, I am happy once again. I am ""Hope"" again. I wasn't for a while. 
Next Saturday is Valentimes day, and we are having a dance (the school I mean) and us girls are all going together. Yay, I'm so excited. I'm going to wear all red and pink and stuff, looking cute:-*. 
This Saturday, we have an OM spontaneuos day, and i'm also excited about that, and then after, my mom and dad are taking me to get my outfit for the dance, and then maybe I can talk them into either a.)taking me to barnes and noble, or b.)take me to panera for dinner, or c.) both. I'm such a little spoiled brat when in comes to things like this. 
I woke up thinking it was Friday, and I'm still thinking it's Friday. I'm silly."

"event","*Sigh*Love'll getcha. You are so mezmorized by love that you're just like, wow, breatheless. And when the one you love talks to you, you feel good. You feel like you have accomplished something on your daily to-do list. Zack didn't actually talk to me, (wait, does online count?)He threw a piece of rolled up paper at me and I turned around and yelled ""YOU FUCKER! WHAT THE HELL!?"" He just smiled at me real cute, and said ""Smile, you've got tickets!"" He's cute, in that large 4 year old kind of way. He isn't cute, but the personality got me. (Is the word 'Personality'tatooed on my forhead or something?)I just...love him. I love him. Hannah asked me one day ""Is this puppy love or romantic love?"" ""just love"" I had answered. I loved everything about him. When he talked to me online he got bored when I got off and would always and still does tell my friends to call me and ask me when I'de be on. I would of course be thinking 'oh god he likes me!' I've never had a first kiss, or had anyone ask me out, or a boyfriend in that matter. I guess it's better for Zack and I to be friends. I relly like him though. He tells my friends he likes me, then he says to one oerson only as a friend. His friend Hillary told me that she was talking to him on the phone and he told her he might ask me out and he asked for her opinion. I was happy to hear it, but then, I didn't know if she was seeing what I would do or if it was true, so  kept my cool. 
I had to stay in school till 5:30 today for OM. Long story. I get to hang with my Pallies though!Hazel and Tivona and our ss teach, Miss Brew (I LOVE YOU MISS BREW!) made my day loverly. T's mom brought pizza and we ran around the empty school all night. Hehe, fun.
Dagh, that's enough.

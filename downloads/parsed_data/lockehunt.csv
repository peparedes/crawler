I stole his journal 'cause he never updates and I know his password. *whispers* This is <lj user=""actress_krissie""/>!

Yeah...he's got his dancey thingy for his church thingy...so that probably adds to his never updating...though he'd never update anyway, m'sure...

Oh! He's also gotta do that American Artist project! *points and laughs* S'what he gets for being a junior!

Aaaaaand...UO! 'Cause he's there a lot, too...

So, yeah. He's actually got a life off the pooter, and does something other than wonder whyhe's not on the pooter. Psh, loser.

Yeah, I just wanted to steal his journal and ramble...oooooooooh!!

Because nobody's friended Rusty, I can say it without fear that it'll be found!!!!

My story's up on valensmut!! Go read it! Dooooo it! It's the last-posted one from yesterday...

...Right, then. Suppose I'll go spam my own journal with memes or something, now...I'll just go over there. --->

"event","My little sister is in the nutcracker like last year and the year before.  This is all well and good.  I have always enjoyed taking one of my only days off and going to the ballet to support my arrogant little sister the whole time fearing that our car might get slashed like it did two years ago.  ^_^
     Lucky me, our family doesn't believe that anyone in our family is capable of having thier own christmas.  We ALWAYS have someone over whether it be grandparents or random aunt's/uncles/friends.  Sometimes we have them come with us to the ballet.  My stepmom freaks out every time we have someone over for any amount of time as if how clean or neat the house was at that exact time was the determining factor in her afterlife between heaven and hell.  Needless to say, it makes it interesting.
     This would not be all that bad if Casey hadn't been the one who had to give up her room for our grandparents for the holiday.  THIS would not have been so bad if Casey hadn't been the one leaving for college as soon as Eric was leaving and at the same time as our grandparents.  SO!  Today we got to move her out of her bedroom (including her bed, her shelves and bureau, clothes, etc.) into the garage for the time being.  
     SO!  We cleaned the house COMPLETELY (taking about four hours on it's own,) moved Casey's room (should have taking two hours), and got ready for the ballet (it takes longer than it may seem for our family with five kids) all in about one hour.  YAY!  THAT was a task!  We took it on with vigor.  We pulled it off very well and now we are all sitting around with nothing to do... waiting for people to come and waiting for our stepmother to calm down.  I almost went insane listening to her say ""I... I can't have that there.  I can't have that there!  Please (insert command here).  I... but we need (insert noun here).  I... yes.... no!  NO!""  grr.... This Had BETTER go well..."

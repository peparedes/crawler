Today marks the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, which established the constitutional right for abortion in the U.S. This year's topic is why it's important to vote pro-choice. <br /><br />I vote pro-choice because I know that laws can chip away at our constitutional rights by providing a narrower definition on what we can and cannot do. Currently, there are bills in Congress that will mandate the physician performing an abortion offer to do an ultrasound. Most of these laws are known as ""informed consent"" laws but in fact they are crafted by pro-life activists to change a woman's mind if she sees an image of the fetus. I did my honors thesis on the significance of the pro-life movement using ultrasound as a tool to prevent women from getting abortions. <br /><br />I vote pro-choice because Congress needs to hear a woman's perspective on pregnancy. Too often we hear male pro-lifers decry women who have abortions as hateful murderers who deserve to rot in hell. This is not to say that there aren't pro-life women (some of the most powerful pro-life activists are women), but pregnancy is an experience that is sex-specific. <br /><br />I vote pro-choice because I know women who have had abortions and go on to have good lives. They don't live regretful lives full of sorrow. Of course not all women feel this way but too often we hear about post-abortion syndrome but we don't hear much about women saying they made the right choice in the media. Take the Degrassi episode about a teenager who has an abortion and said it was the right choice - it's banned from airing in the U.S. <br /><br />I vote pro-choice because it is my patriotic duty to protect the reproductive decisions of all women. While many may demonize us as murderers waving our coat hangers in triumph, we're women (and men) who want a say in whether we bring life into this world or not. Whether you want a child or not, your choice is protected by Roe v. Wade."

I don't really see how it got so hyped up on Broadway and ""Memory"" is an ok song but nothing special. It doesn't even belong in this musical. 

I'm already starting to feel a little sick again. Hopefully, this time it's just a cold so I'm staying in all day watching tv/going online (so the usual)."

Please please please stop showing Pretty Woman 3 million times a week. It's not a terrible movie but it's getting tired and it gives unrealistic expectations of love. I'm sorry but I don't see a millionaire falling in love with a prostitute, let alone be given that kind of money to be his ""date"". 

There are so many other great movies that you made that show strong women changing the law and how society views women. These would be so much more representative for a channel that emphasizes ""my story"".

"event","I've been pondering some thoughts about how we can help other people, whether in emergency situations or in daily life. I believe the best way to help someone is to point out some key resources and let them take it from there. If we hand down everything someone needs, without showing them how to go about it, I don't think they will truly learn it. 

This doesn't necessarily mean that if we see someone dying in the streets, we point out the closest emergency room and then leave them to die. There are of course exceptions like these in which we need to directly help people. So if for example, a woman and her children become homeless , pointing her to an organization that can get her Section 8 housing would be an appropriate thing to do. Don't forget that many people might be too proud to be offered a room in one's house and would want to do it themselves. So you would actually be helping someone keep their pride intact by offering a referral. 

i guess it's close to the saying, ""Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him                      how to fish and he will eat for a lifetime"". 

I try to offer referrals for appropriate organizations/contacts on places like Yahoo Answers and occasionally here on LJ. Lately, I've been getting great feedback that the information I offered was helpful. 

Agree? Disagree? Has anyone tried this approach?"

Ann Arbor, Michigan passed a resolution banning commercially bottled water at city events and Salt Lake City, Utah asked department heads to eliminate bottled water.</p> <p> Critics charge the bottled water industry adds plastic to landfills, uses too much energy by producing and shipping bottles across the world and undermines confidence in the safety and cleanliness of public water supplies, all while much of the world's population is without access to clean water.</p> <p> But industry observers said such opposition is unlikely to drain U.S. sales of bottled water, which reached 2.6 billion cases in 2006, according to Beverage Digest. The industry newsletter estimated that U.S. consumers spent about $15 billion on bottled water last year. ""Consumers have an affection for bottled water. It's not an issue of taste or health, it's about convenience,"" the newsletter's publisher, John Sicher, said. ""Try walking up (New York City's) Third Avenue on a hot day and getting a glass of tap water.""</p> <p> Dave Kolpak, a portfolio manager at Victory Capital Management, said the environmental objections will have little impact on the bottom line for either Pepsi or Coke, though he admitted it could slow the market's growth rate.</p>  ""Pepsi and Coke do not make a lot of profit"" on bottled water, said Kolpak, adding that people may talk about the issue, but will likely continue buying some bottled water. Victory Capital owns about 3 million shares of PepsiCo among its $62 billion under management.<br /><br />Link: http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/27/pepsico.aquafina.reut/index.html</div><!--startclickprintexclude--><span class=""cnnEmbeddedMosLnk""> </span>"

I thought ok this is a show that's going to make it sound like everyone in the military is a hero and the wives just sit around and do nothing but chat and shop and wait for their husbands to come home. <br /><br />Well I was dead wrong. <br /><br />The series focuses on five people who each met because of the fact they have spouses in the army.&nbsp; We have a former bartender who marries a newish recruit and move out to the base where's he's training with her two kids, a wife who misses her husband as he's always overseas in battle while dealing with her abusive son, the matriarch of the group who is trying to maneuver the politics in the army to help get her husband ahead (she gave up a degree in law to be with him), a surrogate mother who becomes one b/c her family is in debt and her husband doesn't quite have the same skill she has with a gun (she was a former cop), and we have a male spouse whose wife is in charge of over 400 men overseas in Iraq and comes back with PTSD. So we have a pretty diverse group here. <br /><br />As you can already tell it's issue based. There are themes about violence, daily army life, lots of love, and secrets. I'm looking forward to a successful series for Lifetime after the last few have bombed.<br /><br />Anybody else watching?<br /><br />P.S. The series is based on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Under-Sabers-Unwritten-Code-Wives/dp/0312333501/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product/104-5940031-7565541""><b class=""sans"">Under the Sabers: The Unwritten Code of Army Wives</b></a> in case you're curious."

There are a few that had I known what they were like, I could have saved myself some trouble. However, as Danielle Martinetti notes, you find out a lot about someone on the first date. </p>  <p>When I doubled with a friend of mine in high school on an almost blind date, we witnessed firsthand how two seemingly nice guys can turn into jerks by hitting on some other girls at the movies b/c my friend was a little too heavy for her date and I stood by her. <br/> </p>  <p style=""text-align: right; font-size: 8px"">Blogged with <a href=""http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock"" title=""Flock"" target=""_new"">Flock</a></p>"

"event","I've been bouncing around an idea of trying to do some freelance writing for some online web sites (they pay so I won't be doing it for complete charity). Thoughts? Good idea, crappy idea? 

I know I don't have much time but sometimes with the monotony of work, I want to do something that's interesting for me to do.

Update: In case you're wondering what I might write about, I have a bit of research in reproductive rights, human rights, feminism in general, science (specifically zoology)."

"event","To all my dessert loving friends, I thought this was fun. I look forward to<br />getting your responses.<br /><br />If all of the desserts listed below were sitting in front of you, which<br />would you choose. (you can only pick one!) Trust me...this is reputed to be<br />very accurate. &nbsp;Yeah, I bet!!!<br /><br />Pick your dessert, then look to see what psychiatrists think about you.<br /><br />After taking this dessert personality test, send this e-mail on to others,<br />but when you do, be sure to put your choice of dessert in the subject box<br />above.<br /><br />ALSO, SEND IT TO THE PERSON WHO SENT IT TO YOU.<br /><br />Here are your choices:<br /><br />1. Angel Food Cake<br />2. Brownies<br />3. Lemon Meringue<br />4. Vanilla cake with Chocolate Icing<br />5. Strawberry Short Cake<br />6. Chocolate on Chocolate<br />7. Ice Cream<br />8. Carrot Cake<br /><div text=""Read on for the interpretations"" class=""ljcut"">Type your cut contents here.<br /><br />No, you can't change your mind once you scroll down, so think carefully<br />what<br />your choice will be....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />OK - Now that you've made your choice this is what research says about<br />you...<br /><br /><br /><br />1. ANGEL FOOD CAKE -- Sweet, loving, cuddly. You love all warm and fuzzy<br />items. A little nutty at times. Sometimes you need an ice cream cone at the<br />end of the day. Others perceive you as being childlike and immature at<br />times.<br /><br /><br />2. BROWNIES -- You are adventurous, love new ideas, are a champion of<br />underdogs and a slayer of dragons. When tempers flare up you whip out your<br />saber. You are always the oddball with a unique sense of humor and<br />direction. You tend to be very loyal.<br /><br /><br />3. LEMON MERINGUE --Smooth, sexy, &amp; articulate with your hands, you are an<br />excellent after-dinner speaker and a good teacher. But don't try to walk<br />and<br />chew gum at the same time. A bit of a diva at times, but you have many<br />friends.<br /><br /><br />4. VANILLA CAKE WITH CHOCOLATE ICING -- Fun-loving, sassy, humorous, not<br />very gro unded in life; very indecisive and lack motivation. Everyone<br />enjoys<br />being around you, but you are a practical joker. Others should be cautious<br />in making you mad. However, you are a friend for life.<br /><br /><br />5. STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE -- Romantic, warm, loving. You care about other<br />people, can be counted on in a pinch and expect the same in return.<br />Intuitively keen. Can be very emotional.<br /><br /><br />6. CHOCOLATE ON CHOCOLATE -- Sexy; always ready to give and receive. Very<br />creat ive, adventurous, amb itious, an d passionate. You can appear to have<br />a cold exterior but are warm on the inside. Not afraid to take chances.<br />Will not settle for anything average in life. Love to laugh.<br /><br /><br />7. ICE CREAM -- You like sports, whether it be baseball, football,<br />basketball, or soccer. If you could, you would like to participate, but<br />you enjoy watching sports. You don't like to give up the remote control.<br />You<br />tend to be self-centered and high maintenance.<br /><br />8. CARROT CAKE -- You are a very fun loving person, who likes to laugh. You<br />are fun to be with. People like to hang out with you. You are a very warm<br />hearted person and a little quirky at times. You have many loyal friends.</div><br />What are you? I picked brownies."

"event","VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN: NAPOLITANO, APPLY AND UPDATE LAWS
(AGI) - Rome, Nov 25 - Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, on the occasion of the international day against violence against women sent Barbara Pollastrini, minister for Equal Opportunities, a message in which he underlines that ""today's reality is still dramatic: the data on abortion, rapes, genital mutilation, forced weddings show the tragedy of the situation of women in many parts of the world. But violence against women"" Napolitano explains ""unfortunately is a phenomenon that is still present in economically developed, democratic countries as well. This year, in Italy, there has been a strong increase women victim of (sexual) violence. The aggression is most frequently registered inside family circles, making it harder to discover the phenomenon and to fight against it. The violence happens despite the specific laws against it and despite concrete assistance for the victims like 'shelter homes' and services for denunciation. The laws must be rigorously applied and, if necessary, updated. But the law alone is not enough. Initiatives are needed to spread a culture of non-violence and respect for the dignity of women in order to actuate the constitutional principles, that favour the respect for human dignity and equality between sexes. This culture has to be translated into daily behaviour, private and public language in all fields and environments, to become a constitutive element of our civil life"".

I agree wholeheartedly with this statement by Napolitano. Not only do we need to recognize that violence against women is a universal phenomenon found in every nation, but that more work needs to be done than pass some laws every now and then. We need to change the culture we all live in. I wonder, as I'm sure most of you may too, why abortion is listed in the types of violence against women. I wonder if he means forced abortions or that he views abortion as a crime against women, an invasion by the medical community into the private sphere of motherhood. 

I also recognize that he stated ""genital mutilation."" There is a lot of controversy over what term is used as mutilation seems to evoke the racist savagery associated with those who practice this tradition that is overgeneralized to ""those people."" However, female circumcision may seem almost as innocuous as when boys are circumcised at birth (and yes I know that there are campaigns against this). There's a brief, but well written discussion about this written by Tobe Levin at the end of ""Born in the Big Rains"" by Fadumo Korn, a memoir of a woman's experience with infibulation in Somalia and how she lived her life after the rite. I highly recommend this book."

Is America too Racist for Barack? Too Sexist for Hillary?

By Benjamin Wallace-Wells
Sunday, November 12, 2006; B01

The 2006 elections were for the technocrats and the operatives, pitting the Democratic tacticians against the Karl Rove machine. But the next election is already beginning to look quite different: 2008 may be one for the novelists.

Viewers of the election returns late on Tuesday, after all, got an early start on the iconography of the next presidential race. The cable networks' cameras cut between Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, thanking her supporters for an overwhelming victory in the New York Senate race, her husband standing pointedly behind, and a smiling Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, giving cautious, professorial analysis to the television viewers. Nobody noted the significance, but it stared us all in the face: The two presumed leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination are a woman and an African American.

Their candidacies -- coming after elections resulting in the presumed first female speaker of the House and the second black governor since Reconstruction -- suggest that the next elections may play in ways that are more cultural and symbolic than tactical and political. Are Americans ready to put a black man or a woman in charge of the country? And does the hefty symbolism that Obama and Clinton would bring help one of them more than the other -- in other words, is the country more racist or more sexist?

Democracies are awkward like this. Despite incessant polling, we really get only one moment every two years, at best, to measure how Americans feel about things, and these elections must stand as imperfect proxies for a mess of subjects: what we think about religion, whether we like being included in the international conversation, whether Northeast bluebloods would tolerate a Texan as their leader.

But when it comes to race and sex, this seems a slightly more legitimate game: The question that remains for black Americans and women isn't whether prejudice has diffused to the point that they can participate in the United States, it's whether they can legitimately hope to lead it.

Today, they may have reasons to be optimistic. Poll numbers for Clinton and Obama are among the strongest of any presidential hopefuls. It now seems nearly as common for political leaders in television shows and movies to be women or racial minorities as white men. Recent polls have found that the percentages of Americans who say they would not vote for a hypothetical black or female presidential candidate, long formidable, have dwindled into the single digits. And last Tuesday's elections put House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on the brink of becoming speaker and Democrat Deval Patrick, who is black, in the Massachusetts governorship.

But as the two would-be presidential candidates grapple with how to manage the legacies of their own identities, Obama seems engaged with a more problematic political feeling. Even if race is more socially crippling than gender -- even if it was less likely that Obama would make it to Harvard Law than that Clinton would make it to Yale Law -- the symbolism of race can also be awfully empowering to individual politicians who learn to harness it. Most Americans want to believe that the culture has moved past its racial problems, and that the symbol of that progress would be widely cheered. Compared with Clinton, says George Lakoff, a linguistics professor and Democratic message guru, ""Obama clearly has it better.""

Whatever racism remains in this country, it coexists with a galloping desire to put that old race stuff behind us, to have a national Goodbye to All That moment. The most recent such occasion was Obama's much-publicized tour to promote his book of policy prescriptions, ""The Audacity of Hope."" The Denver Post called him a ""rock star,"" the Seattle Times found him ""electrifying,"" and even the Deseret News in Salt Lake City described the ""raucous greeting"" he received in Utah. This rapture wasn't only because of what Obama has said; most of his audiences had not heard much from him or read much of his book. It was because he symbolizes the possibility of a more modern America.

Clinton had a best-selling autobiography and a media-heavy book tour, too, but the coverage had less to do with the symbolism she carried as a woman than with her history as Bill Clinton's wife, and with the way she was positioning herself for the future. There are many reasons for this difference, but one critical one has to do with the legacies of oppression that each inherits. While many Americans have a sincere sense of sentimentality and nostalgia for what Clinton may consider outdated gender roles, a much smaller number have that kind of feeling for racial segregation. There is the sense that, by electing a female president, the nation would be meeting a standard set by other liberal democracies; the election of a black man, by contrast, would be a particularly American achievement, an affirmation of American ideals and a celebration of American circumstances.

Obama's mixed-race heritage is rarely far from his political conversation. He writes of having a Kansan mother ""as white as milk,"" and a Kenyan father ""as black as pitch."" He has used his race explicitly while speaking in Africa and urging politicians there to move beyond tribalism, and implicitly while speaking in southern Illinois to punctuate an address about the challenges of globalization. In his speeches, Obama uses his simple presence as an establishment national political figure who is black to serve as a metaphorical exclamation point -- a visual assurance that the country can work for everyone.

This is how he used it in his most famous speech, at the 2004 Democratic National Convention: ""I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on Earth, is my story even possible.""

When Clinton gives a speech, her gender is just as evident, but she doesn't give it nearly the same kind of rhetorical prominence. She is as likely to talk about handing out buttons for Republican Barry Goldwater as a child as about what her presence as a political woman means for the country. Her most famous speech during the current political cycle dealt with a topic close to her own identity: In January 2005, she gave a widely praised talk to a group of New York state family-planning providers, telling them that the pro-choice movement had failed to acknowledge the great emotional cost involved in having an abortion. For Clinton, a hero to many women who support abortion rights, this was regarded as a particularly brave stance.

But in a speech about such a personal topic, what is most noteworthy is its impersonality. Clinton didn't mention her own experiences as a wife or a mother, but seized upon a trip she took to Romania as first lady, where she learned about the policies of the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, who tried to force every woman to have five children for the glory of the state, subjecting them to monthly roundups and reproductive exams attended by the secret police. It's a striking story, but what's even more striking is the way Clinton introduced it: ""My own views of family planning and reproductive rights are heavily influenced by my travels as first lady,"" she said. This is not only the kind of thing that Sen. Joe Biden might say, but it also sounds suspicious: Were Clinton's views on these issues not fully formed before she began traveling as first lady?

The contrast is vivid in the two senators' autobiographies. Obama's, ""Dreams From My Father,"" is an attempt to explain his evolving political awareness as a direct articulation of his roots. Here is the way Clinton begins her life story, ""Living History"": ""I wasn't born a first lady or a senator. I wasn't born a Democrat. I wasn't born a lawyer or an advocate for women's rights and human rights. I wasn't born a wife or a mother.""

Part of this difference is simple personal style. And there's also the matter of learned political behavior: Clinton has spent a decade and a half being beaten up, often personally and viciously, for the intersection of her gender and her politics, and it would make sense if she were trying to disconnect the two. But there is something else here.

The political progress of women and African Americans has long been intertwined; the suffragette movement gained huge momentum from the complaint that black men had received the right to vote before women of any race. But when it comes to modern political leadership, women have become more present. In January, the Senate will have 16 women and one African American, while eight women and one African American will be governors. Geraldine Ferraro was a vice presidential running mate more than 20 years ago, and still no black politician has reached that plateau.

Gender, meanwhile, may have become part of the political wallpaper. When Rep. Harold E. Ford Jr. and Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele ran for Senate this fall, their race was mentioned in virtually every story; when Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Claire McCaskill ran, their gender was barely noted. The ferocity of national feelings about race can still be threatening; this election cycle saw the widely condemned race-baiting ads run against Ford in Tennessee. But if the nation feels its racial sins more clearly, it also has a more urgent desire to get past them. ""I think gender has become more normal in leadership,"" said Marie Wilson, president of the White House Project, a New York nonprofit that works to develop female leaders with the goal of having a woman in the White House. ""Race is a much more troubling, sadder, unresolved part of our history than the issue of gender, so it certainly looms larger.""

Of course, the civil rights and women's rights movements of the 1960s have left vastly different legacies. No political figure would dare deny the saintliness of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.; Betty Friedan's name is a political dirty word. Repression of blacks was the stuff of massive state-leveraged cruelty -- the police dogs and fire hoses -- while repression of women in this country was made of quieter stuff: bras, aprons and constitutional amendments.

Obama is frequently called post-racial, the suggestion being that because he has an exotic background, Americans are looking at a newer model of a human. The metaphor works for Obama politically, because it contains the idea that his youth lets him create a more modern and inclusive brand of politics than the rhetoric of civil rights-era politicians such as Jesse Jackson. Clinton's Jesse Jacksons are Ferraro, who bombed, and Pelosi, who is still hanging around.

This is the ultimate imbalance between the would-be presidential contenders, and it's both rough on Clinton and helps explain why Obama's public presentation is so much more closely linked to his identity: There's a model for being post-racial, but there's no easy way to be post-gender.

Fredrick Harris, a political scientist at the University of Rochester, sees a post-gender future out there, and its name is Condoleezza Rice. The secretary of state, he notes, ""is unmarried, has no children, is completely dedicated to her job, for pleasure she plays the piano and works and that's about it.""

Clinton has made different choices, but they have their limits. Politically, she has done everything that Obama has done: She has become a serious policy professional, moved toward the center and renounced the excesses of 1960s-style identity politics. And yet these moves are received as the tacks of a smart politician. For Obama, they are received as the arrival of his race.

1. Do you agree with the author that race is social cripping than gender? He states that if Obama becomes president, it would be more indicative of America's progress and values. If Clinton wins, it would be equivalent to other nations promoting the advancement of women in politics. 

2. Should this election even be concerned with what minority, whether racial or gender, becomes president? Obama seems to be admired by more Americans than Clinton on several issues. 

3. Do you think gender was really ignored in this past election? Although several female candidates didn't talk about their gender, doesn't the fact that several women won governorships as well as more seats in Congress count as evidence that women are given the same credibility as their male counterparts? 

4. What do you think of this distinction as ""post-racial"" for Obama. Is he considered to be a leader of the African American rights movement that is appealing to Americans who don't like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton for example. 


5. Is Condoleeza Rice a good example of ""post-gender"" (if this term should even apply to anyone)? Yes, she's single, has no children and has a job that takes up most of her time. Too often however there seems to be a duality that is seen in the media, the housewife who takes care of the children and her husband and the career woman who is selfish enough to preoccupy herself with a job and doesn't feel a need to get married and have children. I always seem to see this duality as women are always perceived as these two stereotypical gender roles, seen as good vs. evil."

"event","New Theory For Mass Extinctions
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/10/061025085208.htm

A new theory on just what causes Earth's worst mass extinctions may help settle the endless scientific dust-up on the matter. Whether you favor meteor impacts, volcanic eruptions, cosmic rays, epidemics, or some other cause for the worst mass extinction events in Earth's history, no single cause has ever satisfied all scientists all the time for any extinction event. That may be because big extinctions aren't simple events.

The new Press/Pulse theory gets around the controversy by rejecting the all-or-nothing approach to mass extinction, calling instead on a combination of deadly sudden catastrophes - ""pulses"" - with longer, steadier pressures on species - ""presses.""

<lj-cut text=""Rest of the article"">""What we wanted to do is move away from the idiosyncratic approach to extinction mechanisms and look for what these intervals had in common. If you have A and B you will get a mass extinction,"" said Ian West, a 2006 graduate of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, NY.

West and Hobart and William Colleges paleontology professor Nan Crystal Arens are scheduled to present their work on the Press/Pulse theory on Wednesday, 25 October, at the Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America in Philadelphia.

Using databases that chart genera of marine organisms and their extinctions through the fossil record, West and Arens divided the last 488 million years of geologic history into four groups: times of suspected impact events (Pulses), times of massive volcanic eruptions (Presses), times when neither Presses nor Pulses occurred, and times when Press and Pulse coincided. They compared average extinction rates in geologic stages in each of these groups.

During stages when only impacts occurred, an average of 7.3% of genera became extinct every million years; 8.3% of genera became extinct in stages characterized by flood volcanism alone. When neither Press nor Pulse were active, 8.2% of genera became extinct. These averages are statistically indistinguishable. ""Statistically speaking, extinction rates are not significantly higher at times of impact or volcanism vs. no geologic events,"" West said.

In contrast, when Press and Pulse events coincided, an average of 12.8% of genera became extinct per million years, statistically higher than the rate observed during other geologic stages.

""The goal of our work was to come up with a unifying theory of mass extinctions. We also wanted to make it applicable to what's going on now,"" said West, referring to rapid losses of biodiversity worldwide now underway as a result of climate change and destruction of habitats by human activities.

""Is this model, which seems to work for the big five mass extinction events in Earth's history, applicable today?"" West asked.

At first glance the answer would appear to be 'no.' There is, after all, no massive flood basalt eruption underway today, nor have there been any recent meteor impacts. On the other hand, some very similar effects are being seen on Earth.

""We came up with the idea that humans themselves act as both Press and a Pulse,"" said West. ""Humans began manipulating the environment - the Press - from the advent of agriculture. However, that alone did not trigger the current mass extinction. That seems to have been triggered by the pulse of industrialization and the demands for energy and resources that came with it.""

The bottom line, says West is that it's extremely hard to pinpoint simple causes for Earth's great periods of extinction.

""We sought to rephrase the question,"" said Arens. ""In the modern world, species are commonly endangered by some stress before the final death blow falls. It seems likely that biological systems in the past worked in similar ways. By demonstrating that the coincidence of long-term stress and catastrophic disturbance is needed to produce big extinctions, we hope to break down some of the polarization characteristic of many discussions of extinction. We hope to send people back to the data with a more inclusive hypothesis to test.""</lj-cut>

"event","Hello. My name is Melanie. I have a friend in Uganda who's in prison because he wasn't able to afford the hospital bills for his recently deceased sister Gladys, who died of AIDS and left a small child behind. He owes $350, which includes the hospital bills and court fees. He endures beatings in prison and only eats once a day, sometimes with stones in his food. Uganda prisons can be very harsh and they have been cited as violating human rights.

"event","TUCSON, Arizona (AP) -- Conservation groups have gone to court to try to stop the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from removing a tiny owl from the endangered species list.

The cactus ferruginous pygmy owl -- which is only about 6 inches long and weighs less than 3 ounces -- has been at the center of a battle between environmentalists and developers for years.

It is scheduled to officially be taken off the list Monday.

The Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife filed suit in federal court in Tucson on Thursday challenging the delisting decision and requesting a temporary restraining order to block Monday's action.

The Justice Department filed a response Friday asking the court to deny a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction.

The Fish and Wildlife Service is removing the pygmy owl from the endangered species list because it has determined it is not a distinct subspecies.

<lj-cut>There are only 13 known pygmy owls left in Arizona, said Jenny Neeley of the Defenders of Wildlife. Neeley said the owl, which has been listed as endangered since 1997, will face imminent extinction if the protection is removed.

Critical habitat designations for the owl covering more than a million acres in Arizona will be lifted if the owl comes off the list.

Developers and landowners have opposed endangered status for the bird because of its economic impact. Its presence delayed numerous developments and road projects, and also blocked construction of a high school northwest of Tucson.

Daniel Patterson, desert ecologist at the Center for Biological Diversity, said eliminating the bird's protection would immediately affect dozens of conservation agreements in southern Arizona.

""If the owl is no longer protected, a lot of these agreements could become invalid, which would open up big new areas to urban sprawl,"" he said.

The current agreements typically require a biological opinion if a developer wants to build a project, spelling out how to avoid an adverse impact on the owl.

A Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman declined comment, noting the case has been turned over to the Justice Department.

"event","Study: It really does hurt to wait
For some, anticipation can be as bad as pain they know is coming

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anyone who's ever taken a preschooler to the doctor knows they often cry more before the shot than afterward.

Now researchers using brain scans to unravel the biology of dread have an explanation: For some people, anticipating pain is truly as bad as experiencing it.

How bad? Among people who volunteered to receive electric shocks, almost a third opted for a stronger zap if they could just get it over with, instead of having to wait.

More importantly, the research found that how much attention the brain pays to expected pain determines whether someone is an ""extreme dreader"" -- suggesting that simple diversions could alleviate the misery.

<lj-cut>The research, published in the journal Science, is part of a burgeoning new field called neuroeconomics that uses brain imaging to try to understand how people make choices. Until now, most of that work has focused on reward, the things people will do for positive outcomes.

""We were interested in the dark side of the equation,"" explained Dr. Gregory Berns of Emory University, who led the new study.

""Dread often makes us make bad decisions.""

Standard economic theory says that people should postpone bad outcomes for as long as possible, because something might happen in the interim to improve the outlook.

In real life the ""just get it over with"" reaction is more likely, said Berns, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. He offers a personal example: He usually pays credit card bills as soon as they arrive instead of waiting until they're due, even though ""it doesn't make any sense economically.""

So Berns designed a study to trace dread inside the brain. He put 32 volunteers into an MRI machine while giving them a series of 96 electric shocks to the foot. The shocks varied in intensity, from barely detectable to the pain of a needle jab.

Participants were told one was coming, how strong it would be, and how long the wait for it would be, from 1 to 27 seconds.

Later, participants were given choices: Would they prefer a medium jolt in 5 seconds or 27 seconds? What about a mild jolt in 20 seconds vs. a sharp one in 3 seconds?

When the voltage was identical, the volunteers almost always chose the shortest wait. But those Berns dubbed ""extreme dreaders"" picked the worst shock if it meant not having to wait as long.

The MRI scans showed that a brain network that governs how much pain people feel became active even before they were shocked, particularly the parts of this ""pain matrix"" that are linked to attention -- but not brain regions involving fear and anxiety. The more dread bothered someone, the more attention the pain-sensing parts of the brain were paying to the wait.

In other words, the mere information that you're about to feel pain ""seems to be a source of misery,"" George Lowenstein, a specialist in economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, wrote in an accompanying review of the work.

""These findings support the idea that the decision to delay or expedite an outcome depends critically on how a person feels while waiting,"" Lowenstein added.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse funded the research. What's the link between dread and drug use? It's indirect, but now that scientists know how healthy people's brains anticipate unpleasant consequences, future studies can compare how drug abusers process such information.

"event","BIRMINGHAM, Alabama (AP) -- For the pain of losing an eye and going through 21 operations since she was maimed by a blast at an abortion clinic, Emily Lyons has gotten all she ever expects to receive from the bomber, Eric Rudolph: $57.69.

Lyons was among the first victims to receive a share of the $2.3 million in restitution that Rudolph was ordered to pay after pleading guilty last year in a string of crimes that included the Birmingham clinic attack and the Atlanta Olympics bombing.

<lj-cut>While Lyons laughs at the amount she received -- ""Right now it's a tank and a little more of gas,"" she said Monday -- others view the paltry payments as a disgrace.

""The best thing would have been not to do anything,"" said Diane Derzis, owner of the clinic that was bombed in 1998 in an attack that also killed a police officer. ""To almost lose your life, to lose an eye, to go through all those surgeries and get that little amount -- it's unbelievable.""

Lyons got her check in January. Derzis received $38.42 around the same time. John Hawthorne, whose wife, Alice, was killed in the Olympics bombing in 1996, is still waiting for his.

Hawthorne said he is not concerned about the money. Instead, he said, ""We just want to make sure that if there are any royalties to be made from books or movies or anything that that money doesn't go to him or his family.""

Rudolph is serving four life terms for the Birmingham and Atlanta attacks and two other bombings in Atlanta in 1997. In all, about 110 people were considered victims in the Atlanta cases.

In closing the file on the case, judges ordered Rudolph to pay $2,311,703 to everyone identified as a victim. The order was largely symbolic since Rudolph was previously declared indigent, but there were a few sources of money.

Court officials seized $1,700 in cash that was found in Rudolph's rented trailer in Murphy, North Carolina, and they also raised $2,639 in an auction of items Rudolph left in a rented storage space.

After deducting $1,000 for court costs, the remainder was to be split among the victims. It is unclear how many people have gotten checks or how much has been paid out because those records are not open to the public.

Aside from the restitution, an Alabama judge in 2003 awarded Lyons and her husband $115 million in a lawsuit against Rudolph. Nothing was ever paid.

Lyons' husband, Jeff Lyons, said the small restitution checks were ironic, considering court-appointed attorneys were paid $4 million to defend Rudolph. But Jeff Lyons said he is not complaining.

""I wanted Emily to be alive and I wanted Rudolph to be gone, and I got that,"" he said.

<it>Hawthorne said he is not concerned about the money. Instead, he said, ""We just want to make sure that if there are any royalties to be made from books or movies or anything that that money doesn't go to him or his family.""</it>

Hawthorne lost his wife in the Olympics bombing and now he's telling the press that he doesn't want royalties from books or Hollywood movies to go to him. I guess I can't understand how he jumps from crappy restitution checks for all of the pain Rudolph caused to him wanting to see some of the money from these events being made into entertainment. Can someone help me out here?

I find it very sad that laws designed to protect children from child abuse are used by politicans to ban abortions or make them impossible to obtain. Thank goodness the judge has some common sense and ruled in favor of the Center for Reproductive Rights in saying that children have a right to have their privacy rights respected."

"event","PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Spurred by growing evidence of a link between domestic violence and animal abuse, Maine has enacted a first-in-the-nation law that allows judges to include pets in protection orders for spouses and partners leaving abusive relationships.

In helping pets, advocates hope to help battered women and others who aren't willing to abandon their animals to get out of a bad relationship.

""This is a very innovative, new approach, and it makes perfect sense because the protection order is a critical stage for women and others seeking protection,"" said Nancy Perry of the Washington, D.C.-based Humane Society of the United States.

Gov. John Baldacci says the law, which provides for civil penalties such as fines or jail time for those who violate a protection order, should give pause to abusers who might resort to violence or threats against pets as a means of keeping their victims from leaving a relationship.

Law enforcement officials, animal welfare agents and advocates for domestic violence victims say it's not unusual to hear of abusers who vent their rage against a partner's pet.

""It's just another tactic to keep power and control over the victim,"" said Cindy Peoples of Caring Unlimited, a shelter in York County.
<lj-cut text=""Talk of domestic violence and pets being killed by abusers that may be triggering"">
Susan Walsh, whose dog and sheep were killed by her husband, said many victims stand to benefit from including pets in protection orders.

""I've heard so many horror stories from other women that I knew I was not alone,"" she said.
'Hard to pack up a barn full of animals'

When the bill came up for consideration at a public hearing in January, Walsh recounted how she remained in an abusive marriage in part out of fear for what might happen to her pets and farm animals if she left.

Walsh said her husband shot two of her sheep inside their Ellsworth barn. Another time, when she was visiting her parents in Pennsylvania, he deliberately ran his truck over her deaf and blind border collie in their driveway, she said.

Walsh, who stayed in the marriage for more than 12 years before her divorce in 2001, said she would have left sooner had it not been for her responsibilities to the animals.

""It's kind of hard to pack up a whole barn full of animals,"" she said. ""And I knew that any animal I left behind would be dead in 24 hours.""

The law was an outgrowth of a seminar by the Maine State Bar Association in June on the connection between animal abuse and domestic violence, said Anne Jordan, a Portland lawyer who serves on the Animal Welfare Advisory Council.

During an informal discussion after the presentation, a judge raised the idea of expanding the scope of protection orders, Jordan recalled.

Legislative support was overwhelming, said the bill's sponsor, Rep. John Piotti, a Democrat. He and others cited a study that found that 71 percent of pet-owning women in a Utah shelter said their abusers had either harmed, killed or threatened their pets.
Other states recognize link

Although Maine's law is unique, other states have statutes that reflect the link between domestic violence and animal abuse. Laws in California, Connecticut, Louisiana, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee encourage cross-reporting among agencies involved in law enforcement, domestic violence, child protection and animal control, Perry said.

Animal welfare agents already have been looking at ways to help potentially endangered pets whose owners are in abusive situations.

""A growing trend is called safe havens. These are cooperative agreements between shelters for women and shelters for animals,"" Perry said.

Several agencies in Maine participate in a program called PAWS -- Pets and Women to Safety -- that arranges confidential placement of animals in foster care so their owners can move into a shelter knowing that their pets will be safe.

The Animal Welfare Society in Kennebunk has a PAWS program that works with Caring Unlimited. ""They've worked with all kinds of pets and farm animals,"" Peoples said, ""from cats and dogs to horses and exotic birds.""</lj-cut>

I think it's great that the state of Maine is taking a giant step toward addressing these intersections between domestic violence and violence towards other, including pets.

"event","Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) on Thursday proposed legislation aimed at regulating advertisements for crisis pregnancy centers, saying the clinics attract women under false pretenses by using names and signs resembling those of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and other abortion providers, the New York Sun reports. Under the measure, the Federal Trade Commission would be required to adopt policies barring health providers from advertising ""with the intent to deceptively create the impression that such person is a provider of abortion services if such person does not provide abortion services."" The legislation defines ""abortion services"" as using drugs or surgery to end a pregnancy or providing referrals for such services. <lj-cut text""Read on"">""[These clinics] only offer anti-choice coercion,"" Maloney said, adding, ""If you're a pro-life group, put out a banner that says, 'pro-life counseling.'"" Maloney said that she drafted the bill with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union to avoid infringing on free-speech rights. However, Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles who specializes in First Amendment rights, said the bill might not hold up in court because it attempts to regulate speech that could be viewed as misleading or deceptive but not false. A spokesperson for CareNet, a national network of more than 2,000 counseling centers that oppose abortion rights, did not say the group opposed the bill but sees it as unnecessary. ""No matter how opposed we are to abortion, we are for women and want to be up front in all advertising that we do not offer abortion services,"" she said (Gerstein, New York Sun, 3/31).</lj-cut> (From Kaiser Daily Women's Health Policy Report)

Representative Maloney has been wonderful in advocating for legislation and funds for the pro-choice movement as well as women in general. I really hope this gets passed. I can't even describe how many abortion counseling ads I have seen that are at pregnancy crisis centers. Or the hotlines they have set up if you're considering abortion so that they can convince you not to go through with the procedure. I also applaud her for going to the ACLU to prevent free speech infringements, which will most likely come up as a major criticism of this bill."

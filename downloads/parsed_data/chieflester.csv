"event","<p>Cry Baby was excellent. I really enjoyed it and now I want to watch the real movie. I hope the show gets decent reviews and that people go see it. It's worth it. The show still has lots more previews, and it definitely needs a bit of tuning, but when it comes time for it to open, it'll be great.&nbsp;<br /><br />I ate dinner and dessert with Natasha! It was amazing to spend time with her and catch up.

Tomorrow we intend to go up to where I used to live, eat at Big Nick's, and at night we're seeing Young Frankenstein. We want to look into what shows are for sale at TKTS because we might see one on Saturday. Sunday is for seeing Alex and maybe some other people.&nbsp;<br /><br />It might only be like... 8:30pm... but I'm SO TIRED! I think I'm gonna shower and go to bed soon.

"event","But now I have two wonderful rehearsal shots from the ballet dream/nightmare sequence. The first one is while our singer person is singing ""Somewhere"". During it Riff and I will be on one structure dancing (mind you he's dead... so it's a dream) and Bernardo and Anita will be on the other. Then eventually they turn around and you'll see their wounds... that's when it turns into the nightmare. The other... well... I'll explain it underneath it...<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""there's a place for us...""><img alt="""" src=""http://a460.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/122/l_8a03389510d91c758ff0153eb105c96b.jpg"" /><br />Okay so only our stage right structure is done... so that's where Anita and Bernardo are. Riff and I are sitting on the left.... I'm in blue, see me? In the middle we have Maria and Tony singing their own little version of ""Somewhere"" before they do it... even though Tony just killed her brother. Adam (Diesel, a Jet guy) is laying on the floor... he's technically lifting a chick who wasn't at rehearsal that day.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://a404.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/20/l_e642c04494f0054f59f4d4dfb34a65eb.jpg"" /><br />Before Katie begins singing ""Somehwere"", there's this music where everyone comes on and gets in a line. That's when Anita, Bernardo, Riff, and I head to our structures to climb up and dance. The cast stands there for a moment, then some head into the house to sing and some go off stage to dance. It feels so RENT to me and I love it.<br /></div><br /><br />Peace out."

Today we actually went to Universal, which was tight. I got his employee discount PLUS 35% more... meaning I got 50% off on a two-park pass! Then I got Phi and I to the front of the Spiderman ride where the wait was 40+ mintes long. Phil thinks it might be my total California hottness... ;-)

Anyways, Universal's Islands of Adventure park has a Seuss Landing and it's so Suess'd out and wonderful. I can't wait to show you pictures. I got my a shirt that says Thing 3 and Phil got one that says Thing 4. I also got Mani a really awesome cup. 

Tomorrow is Disneyworld... We're going to Epcott and The Magic Kingdom for sure (and for FREE). If we feel up to it after Phil gets off of work on Wednesday (at 1pm) we'll hit up the others (including the Animal Kingdom). Wednesdday wouldn't be free though, just discounted.

Yesterday when&nbsp;I got to DVC a little after 10am, I began to feel a little bit of pain in my wrists and fingers... a pain I hadn't felt in a while.&nbsp;I then realized that I had forgotten to take my two daily pills... one being an anti-inflammitory! I haven't forgotten to take those pills in so long that I forgot what effect they had one me. So at my break I went to the student store and bought some Alieve or however you spell it. It worked, that's all that matters.

After my drama final I went to say bye to Ed and he hugged me and told me I have great potential and I'm very talented. It was nice to hear that. Especially since he sounded extremely sincere and went out of his way to hug me and all.

Today I'm going to SYT to fill out papers and such. Yay for having a cool summer job!

Tonight I'm seeing Pirates at 8pm in Dub C! Hopefully there will be 6 of us but it's possible it'll only be 4. Sean is my ""date""! He rules!

"event","This is mainly for Stephanie but everyone who might care about my cats can read this: 

Yesterday we took both my cats to the vet because we got a notice that their food was some of that kind that was bad and causing kitty-kidney problems. Both cats got blood drawn and urine sampled. It turned out that Quan-Quan had ""crystals"" in her urine, which meant she had to stay overnight on and IV to drain all the icky stuff out. She gets to come home today all better and stuff. Plus, her other bowl problems are getting a lot better! 

Monster on the other hand had no crystals, but they a problem completely unrelated to the food. She has diabetes... one of the three most common diseases in cats. So she has to have insulen injected twice a day. She's home though and didn't have to stay the night at the vet. 

The good thing about the food stuff is we get completely re-embursed (sp?) for the services at the vet that have to do with issues with the food... like everything to do with Quan and some of the ones done to Monster. 

Okay... now you are all updated :) 

Peace out."

"event","Although there is a total chance I won't get hired... I think I'm gonna at SYT... Here are some details.<br /><br />This summer thing is made up of two intensives where the kids work on a show, but they also learn about stuff. I, as the choreographer, would have to teach them basic ballet, jazz, and tap, as well as tell them/show them famous choreographers and dancers.&nbsp;<br /><br />SYT is doing two Shakespeare shows, but in their shows they like to add one dance number and two songs. Of course they make sure everything is fitting... at least fitting enough for a group of 7th-12th grade students production of Shakespeare.<br /><br />I'd be working four weeks, Mon-Fri, at $750 a week... That's $3,000... AWESOME! It's also contracted so nothing will be taken out of that.<br /><br />The director lady, Robin, is also considering me for their Fall production of <em>High School Musical</em>. Although I don't like that movie... they'd pay me $2,500 to be there two days a week after 3pm and all of tech week... I think I can manage that for that kind of pay! And that means I'd be driving from Sonoma... but again, for that kind of money I'll do it and my dad said that's fine.<br /><br />Robin kept calling me ""Mani's protege""... They LOVE Mani there so that's a good thing. She was also impressed that I played Charity because she loves that role. Another good thing was I had compiled a video with multiple numbers I'd choreographed... all on one tape... and she thought that was a great idea and also thought it was clever. I was thinking to myself <em>clever? Why has no one done that before for you?</em> Oh well... that's points for me!<br /><br />Just thought I'd update you all on this stuff! Peace out!"

I might be going to St. Mary's in the fall! I need to make a phone call there thanks to a favor by a wonderful person! But their theatre program sounds great! Plus, I'd get to live at home, which according to the yearly cost saves me over $10,000. There'll be gas costs and bridge toll costs, but oh well. That's still cheaper. I'm hoping they accept me!

I want to get my second holes in my ears pierced... so maybe some time this week before or after class I'll head to the mall and do that.

Ice skating tonight hopefully! I'm super excited!

Well, I'm off to have a Wii bowling tournament with my parents! Peace out!"

Yup... that sounds EXACTLY like what I need! Now I just need to convince myself that ordering a pair of shoes that are $49.30 is a good idea! Really though... I should just do it because I honestly need them.

Three of the four CSU's I applied for have sent me stuff in the mail asking me to set up accounts and stuff to check admission status... but the one school I think I want to go to the most hasn't yet... Hm... maybe soon?

Okay... I'm gonna list out my day again... even though I did it in my last entry. This is more for me than for you but you can read it if you want...:

*work
*Go to Adv. Dance
*Take Smandon to lunch
*Go to PT
*Hang out with Opie
*Meet Mani at high school
*Eat dinner w/ her
*See DVC musical (also with Amelia and Kevin!)
*Come home to Russell... maybe play some Wii!

That may not seem like TOO much... but really, I'm gonna have NO time to just chill... Well I might have like 30 minutes inbetween lunch and PT...&nbsp;

Peace out!"

"event","So... I guess I shouldn't have jumped to the conclusion that flag twirling was gonna suck... cuz at least what we do in ""Brass Band"" is kinda fun! The flags are home-made and not heavy at all. Although, I do have a feeling I'll be a bit sore tomorrow.

I'm tired...&nbsp;

Tomorrow is gonna be a busy day! I have to work, then go teach at the high school, take Smandon to lunch, go to PT, then come home and hopefully see Opie for a little bit. Then I'm meeting Mani at the high school at 6pm... we're getting dinner and then seeing the DVC musical. That's a lot of non stop action!

I did a butt load of laundry today! I always feel accomplished after doing laundry... and I don't know why. I get that same feeling with dishes too.&nbsp;

Peace out!"

"event","Yesterday in Dance for Musical Theatre, a girl asked me how many show shirts I have. I told her I had one from almost every show I've seen, but there are a few shows I don't have one from. I've decided as this year goes on I'm going to try and acquire the 9 shirts I need to complete my collection! I would technically only need 8 if I hadn't dropped my Chicago shirt (in it's bag) while walking in Times Square, only to realize I did this when it was TOO LATE! ::sigh::<br /><br />Seeing <em>Legally Blonde</em> this weekend will mark my 27th show I've seen (that includes seeing Rent and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels twice each). And by show I mean either in New York or San Francisco... I do not count seeing <em>Phantom of the Opera</em>&nbsp;or <em>42nd Street</em> in Sacramento. Although... I AM counting <em>Phantom</em> in Sacramento in regards to a shirt I still need... complicated...<br /><br />Oh and more news from my MT dance class... Sheri pulled 6 girls out of the ensemble of&nbsp; ""Brass Band"" and told us to wait by the sides while she finished teaching everyone else some stuff. I figured this was gonna be tight because she picked out the 6 best girls in the bunch. It turns out... we're twirling FLAGS in the back... like colorguard girls... I guess it's kinda cool. Sheri probably picked us because we can be trusted. She said the flags are heavy so I'm worried about how my wrists will feel the next day after twirling... but I think I'm gonna get some wrist&nbsp;braces.&nbsp;<br /><br />I gotta start getting dressed! Peace out!"

"event","If you haven't checked out the pics in my last post... go do it! They're great!<br /><br />Today Joey and I went and talked to Mani about my upcoming dance we'll be teaching for Adv. Dance. It's to ""Helena"" by My Chemical Romance (thanks Derek!). I think that dance is gonna turn out SO TIGHT! Not to mention it'll be so different for me because I'm known for happy, uplifting dances. This one is about death and being at a funeral. I'm happy that Joey's gonna help because it'll probably make the choreography better.<br /><br />I saw <em>Norbit</em> with my mom and dad today. It was okay... cute and funny here and there... but it was about 20 minutes too long. I don't highly recommend it at all, but I mean... if you have nothing else to see, why not?&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm supposed to be watching the Grammy's right now but I'm so tired... I think I'm gonna go to bed! Plus, I saw the winner's online so I'm good.<br /><br />I need to stop eating... Seriously, that's all I've done this weekend. And it doesn't seem like I've eaten a lot, but it's WHAT I've eaten. It's all been bad-for-you food.&nbsp;Luckily I haven't been putting on weight like... ever... So I'm not worried, but I should still watch myself.<br /><br />Peace out!"

Yesterday I hung out with Joe-Bean for a while. It's always good to talk to him. I also did some online chatting with Derek, Phil, and Natasha! And of course I had my nightly phone chat with Opie.

Today I have to perform in BOTH of my classes so we'll see how this goes. I know I'm first in Acting on Camera but I'm not sure about Drama. I'm more worried about the Camera class though... it's way more lines!

I need to shower...

"event","My day:

*Went to work at my aunt's for a little while
*Got a Casper dog for lunch
*Went to Target and bought the new Fall Out Boy CD
*Went to DVC and had Art History
*Donated money to a decent cause
*Found out my two dance classes were cancelled
*Got a Wii game at Rasputins
*Got cash from Raleys
*Saw Ashley's car at Hallmark and visited

Now I'm home, waiting for a call from Joe-Bean. Fall Out Boy's new CD is AMAZING. I highly recommend it to EVERYONE. So far #4 is by far my favorite.&nbsp;

Ashley helped me pick out a very funny Valentine's card for Opie! I hope he gets a kick out of it.&nbsp;

"event","I wish someone had kind of... returned the sentiment tonight but that didn't happen... oh well... today has been too good of a day to let that get to me! Here's the good things:

*I got Anna and Phil's packages sent out
*I got my nails done and they're adorable!
*I FOUND OUT WHEN HP7 IS COMING OUT!
*No Art History homework!
*I got more compliments in dance today&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; -I hope I get cast as Charity for our ""Brass Band"" number!
*Dinner was tasty
*Ugly Betty is a cool show
*I'm practically all packed for my SoCal adventure!

I'd say today was productive! Tomorrow should be too, at least before 3pm... after that I'm not sure what I'm gonna do...

Joe-Bean cancelled our hang-out session in order to do homework (and I believe him... his class schedule is nuts!) so I just went home. My dad came home early and stayed home so we hung out and played some Wii. I also made a Raley's run.

Then I went to Olive Garden last night with Knutson, Amelia, Kevin, Kyle, and Alisa. It was fun and tasty! I really enjoy talking to Knutson... he's good at listening AND responding. That was nice :)

Today I'm taking Daniel to work and then I have school from 2pm-6:15pm. But before school I need to go to the post office and maybe I'll get my nails done! I haven't decided on that one yet though...

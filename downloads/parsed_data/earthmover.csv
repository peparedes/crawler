"event","It has been a few day's since my last entry, things are going great for me I could not be happier. Let me just say one thing first I try never to give anyone a hard time on here but lately I feel like someone has drug me thru the mud ""the AOL mud hole"" usually this would not bother me but the more I think of it the more it does, sure I should just say fuk it but that is just not me. I got lied to from the get go and I was never able to shake that it made me wonder if more lie's would be told to me in the future, ok enough of this drama crap lol. I have not been in the room much lately at all, seems it will never change and just get worse. Jaynie.. thanks for being a friend! I gave the tickets to Tammie she wanted to go really badly and is taking someone who I think she will like very much, it just would not be any good without you. There will be other concerts in the future and maybe both our situations will be different then, who knows? Jimmy,,
I have not talked to you inforever, IM me anytime when you see I am on. Usually I am kicking back watching TV.
I wont get into what I have been up to just that I have been spending a lot of time in the Charlotte area.
I did get to meet Dale JR last Saturday night, he is just like us but gets to drive really fast for work lol must be nice huh. I cant wait to get my W2 forms so I can plan a nice  getaway, Cancun ""spelling""
Mexico sounds like the place where I will run away to with a special friend and get started on our tans. Most of you know me who read this, I want you all to know I think about ya'll a lot, probable more than you know so please stay in touch with me. Friends are forever with me I never forget them.

"event","Well like it says another week went by. Nothing special this week just got a forced day off because of the snow and it only delayed a bi monthly saftey meeting till today. Hopefully it will be to cold to have it outside like they had planed or there had better be room for my truck I refuse to be lectured and freeze at the same time.. ha ha. 
It seems that I was called a player this past week and some friends stuck up for me, I thanked them for that
I am no angel, but far from being a player. I usually am the one who gets to involved and usually I get hurt in the process, but that wont happen anymore I guard my feeling now and I dont let them get the best of me.
I should have done this awhile ago but live and learn sometimes is the best way. I hope ya'll have a nice weekend, hehehe I plan on doing just that. ""peace"""

"event","Well I did not go to kens but went to charlotte instead and hand a great time. We went to the Double Door Friday and Saturday nights and also met some people at a place in mooresville. If you ever hear of the group Super Glide go see them they are great and even better to dance with they play the goodole rock n roll music we all like and very well I may say, the lead singer is great. I so much enjoy doing that sort of thing and I did not even get drunk, just had a great time. Been seeing someone that has connections with Nascar so it looks like were going to Daytona for the race, I have been to the track but never the race so it should be a great time and can stay at my dads also, I am sure he would love that. I have been eating like a pig lately, yes I gained 10 LBS, never thought that would be possible lol So I am going to the gym after work and work out my upper body some and hit the tanning bed there also. I need to build up my left arm again I have been putting it off to long afraid I may hurt my neck again but I feel comfortable now that I am strong enough to do so. The Abs and chest will look good this summer I used to have a great upper body untill the surgery then I had to quit lifting weights.
well the shower is calling so I guess i had better end this. Ya'll keep it straight and hard lol,, byeeeee"

I had to go to Charlotte for a class and spent the rest of the weekend there. Went to the comedy zone, Man it was great they had us rolling in our seats then spent a quiet night watching movies saturday night,slept most of the morning away Sunday and woke up and went to concord mall, they have a great place there you can play games eat or go bowling it has been awhile since I bowled and after the first game I was doing very well, funny how things you used to do come back to you again and again. Had a few margaritas and spent the afternoon walking the mall shopping. I got home around 9:30 last night checked my mail and went to bed, God I love the weekends :o)
I dont know all the details but I do hope Jaynie is ok
seems like the shyt never ends for her, some day it will. My phone used to ring every now and then also, got to love free weekends but ohwell.enough for now."

I did hear from my sister todayI didn't go with dad yesterday for carotid ultrasound, but he said the doc gave him a clean bill of health.  Tomorrow he sees the cardiologist.  He went today to ""scope out"" where he was going tomorrow and to take some lab specimens to the family doctor.  He went to the wrong doctor's office - there are two Dr. Marrero's within a block of each other.  The receptionist called me to say that my father was at their office and seemed confused.  Scared me!  Dad said that it didn't look like the same place, but obviously didn't quite know what to do!  So... who knows!  I fear his days of total independence are nearing an end.
I copynpasted it ..was easier  so that is it for now i will add more later"

I am looking forward to the weekend already am going to get out of touch for most of it, I also started planing again on jumping out of a perfectly good airplane was going to do that last summer but with moving and all it slipped away, will just have to see if I can get somebody to jump with me..Ha Ha it has to be the ultimate rush!! Waiting to hear from my sis to see how dads test went, hopefully he will get better before his time to go to Arizonia, to see my other sister I know he was looking forward to that so this may be some incentive for him to want more out of life and spend time with his grand kids and children
OK I had better bundle up and hit the door. It is very chilly this morning 25* outside right now, ya'll have a great day today. I am out."

Am glad another friend is doing better I may not be #1 on her list but I still care and that is all that matters. As the days go by things are looking up, still my dad is going down hill he just has no reason to try and feel better I think he has given up all together and that is so sad. Were a lot alike in many ways I am sure you all would agree on this if you knew him. A good hard working man that raised 4 kids. I am sure you all know what it feels like,  it really hurts when you lose your parents so love them while you can, nothing last forever!"

The drive back to NC was ok I was tired but am used to that people were flying i was running 90mph and was being passed. Went to kens on friday and got TOTALY DRUNK!
Woke up Sat mornin to a good breakfast provided by me and cooked by ken spent the rest of the day trying to feel better told myself I would not start drinking till ken did but I did have a beer around 6pm he was not far behind me waited all day for either a phone call or e-mail to run to charlotte but never got either. The gowing away party for Adam was great we danced and had a good time I then went in to the bedroom to pass out. ""shelia was in there, not kens shelia so i crawled over her and went to sleep next thing I woke up and all hell was breaking lose it was paula slaming doors and cussing john out cheri had crawled in the bed and passed out also and paula came in yelling at her I dont know why but she was pissed for some reason. I went back to sleep with out any trouble. I guess shelia got upset that cheri told her to move over and left mad, hell there was room enough
for all. I was curled up fast asleep it did not matter to me. I woke up around 7am and got some advil from the cubbord John was on the floor in the bedroom also out cold so paula left his ass there lol.
Now some like to tell stories and get things twisted around I would never hurt anyone intentionally I stay out of all the drama but got dragged into it this weekend partly my fault also, but we all do that at times. So how ever the rumor started we had an orgy that night, it never happened!!! Sometimes I wonder who my friends really are!!!"

I then called my sister and asked if they had called her durring the night this was news to her also so she hung up with me and got on the phone herself Shearon was a CC nurse so she knows most very intelegent women. I got there and was informed that he was fine it was a gross mistake in communication she also got this news they did let me go in the CCU unit to see him to make sure all was well, he was fine
thank God. So on to work I went it was raining a little and it was almost 9am now My boss called just to ask how he was which was nice.
After our regular meeting we have every 2 weeks I came home to get ready to pick Shearon up at the airport as strong a women that she is the look of concern and stress was all over her so we went straight to the hospital. Then she took me out to eat dinner we both were starved. They will put a pace maker in him on Wednesday and he should be able to leave Thursday, how things have changed.I would think he would be there awhile but nowadays with micro surgery things are a lot faster.With all this going on my thoughts are also on a special person who has to deal with some tough things lately me included I hope things work out for her she deserves a break from it all and is getting it somewhat now, maybe with the new year coming in she may find the time after things settle down to squeeze me in there somewhere. I may be overbearing when it comes to the way I feel but that is the way I am. I grow on people it just takes TIME is all.

I got home and my phone would not quit I got on my other SN ya`ll know the one for family n shyt and was writing down some info on my brothers kids for Xmas gifts when my sister in  Florida IM me and said they just took her hubby to the hospital he just collasped David is here in Raleigh this week installing some new things for the wake county school system for his company ""snap systems"" we were going to have dinner one night this week, Shearon was a bit frantic she had no idea where they took him or what shape he really was in which I can understand so I got the phone book found out they took him to wake med and went there to get the infon and see him.
David is 69 and shearon is 48 big spread huh!! but you got to know him he is a really great guy they have been married for 20 yrs now and he makes her very happy so that is what really counts. He is resting fine and was alert when I left last night their keeping him for more test to make sure it was just low blood preasure and not a heart attack,he fell asleep so I left there just before midnight and will go back this morning and check on him Shearon should be on a plane by 10 am. ""praying for them both""
Ya`ll have to understand something I miss my family and friends I am a caring type person and express that a lot not meaning to make anyone uncomfortable it is just the way I am and I am glad I am like that in a way makes me different than others. This weekend is still up in the air not sure what I am going to do the thing in Charlotte will be fun not an AOL thingy
so I am hoping things will work out. Thinking back about the past 3 1/2 months. O.K. is time to get ready for work, Keep it real and stay safe."

"event","It has been a very long day for me I have done a lot of thinking about things mostly about myself. I mean the very best in everything I do my parents raised me that way. I am also very hard headed and I dont listen when I should so I need to change that, I let my emotions and feelings get in the way sometimes and dont realize that I am doing harm. My words are few I am almost afraid to say anything anymore for fear that it may be taken the wrong way or mis-understood I do mean well and dont want to hurt anybody or myself."

"event","ok it has been a few days but the only thing different is that we had a bad ice storm that put the city on its knees and shut down my job completly. So I decided to hit the road with no power,TV,Cable or a good looking women to curl up with ""you know who you are"" I decided to hit the road and finish my shopping out of town.So I helped out ken by bringing his kids to him and had some pizza with them then headed west destination unknown lol,just cruise and listen to music.I want so much to be able to help others out that sometimes I forget about myself, I hope that is not a bad thing. There is nothing I wont do for my friends or loved ones, some need to learn this!!It is just the way I am. so forgive me if i keep offering..lol just get over it I will never change that about me. Anyways I am going to hit the malls around hickory and hopefully will hear something from Jimmy then maybe ride down there. Yes we worry about you also Jimmy but that is what friends are for also so call!!! ok time to hit the sack maybe tomorrow will bring a better day for us all.. Good Night :o)"

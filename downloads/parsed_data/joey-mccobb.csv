while im on the subject of iran and the middle east, can we just blow up israel so everyone can stfu? or how about israel share and give palestine gaza and the west bank? i am pretty sure allah/yhwh/buddah/mahesh/laozi/luke skywalker are not cool with global warming, so if they're going to kill each other, could they at least use natural gas or some crazy top secret fuel cell in the hummers and bio-diesel in the tanks?  

speaking of crazy...oh, another awesome segue way? segueway? segway (like the nerdy back to the future thing)? if you ever want a ride from an unctuous limo driver, ask jenny to stand on a street corner with you. i don't care if im rambling or if this doesn't make any sense, im tired. why don't you go stick some harry winston's up yer nose."

So-called U.S. hostage appears to be toy
Tuesday, February 1, 2005 Posted: 5:37 PM EST (2237 GMT)

(CNN) -- A photograph posted on an Islamist Web site appears to be that of an action figure and not a U.S. soldier being held hostage.

Liam Cusack, the marketing coordinator for Dragon Models USA, said the figure pictured on the Web site is believed to be ""Special Ops Cody,"" a military action figure the company manufactured in late 2003.

""It pretty much looks exactly like the same person,"" he said.

Cusack said he was contacted Tuesday morning by one of his retailers, who informed him that the alleged hostage appeared to be one of the company's action figures.

""I thought it was a joke at first,"" he said.

But after reading a report on a news Web site about a U.S. soldier allegedly being captured, ""I looked at it and said, 'It does look like one of our action figures.'""

""Cody"" is an action figure the company made for the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, which supplies U.S. military bases worldwide with various items. The doll was meant to look like a U.S. soldier who might be serving in Iraq, Cusack said.

On the Islamist Web site, a group calling itself the Al Mujahedeen Brigade, posted a photograph of a man it claimed was a captured U.S. soldier named John Adam, and it threatened to behead him if Iraqi prisoners are not released by U.S. forces.

Staff Sgt. Nick Minecci of the U.S. military's press office in Baghdad told The Associated Press that ""no units have reported anyone missing.""

The photograph showed the figure against a black flag with white lettering reading, ""God is great, there is no god but Allah."" A U.S. military assault rifle was pointed at its head. It appears that ""rifle"" was part of the plastic weaponry that came with the action figure.

The photograph immediately raised questions.

CNN military analyst James Marks, a retired Army general, questioned its authenticity.

He told CNN in a phone interview that the flak jacket in the picture had a kind of trim along the edges that he'd never seen before, and that the open-legged pants, as opposed to gathered hems, struck him as odd.

He also questioned what appeared to be camouflage paint on the face.

""We have not used camo paint with conventional forces serving in Iraq,"" Marks said.

addendum: donnie rumsfeld pays a visit to the troops in iraq. 
the administration is somehow toting this as a moral boosting trip for the soldiers? 
hey i've got an idea...instead of promising the troops a victory in iraq (i thought we had won this ""war"" months ago?), how about promising all of them they'll go home to see their families and loved ones unscathed. i wouldn't be surprised at all if it were a 'machine' that was shaking the hands of the wounded soldiers."

born june 27, 2004 
found dead 5:45pm december 12, 2004 
revived 6:58pm december, 12 2004. 

the ipod was found peacefully resting on the drivers seat in donald's vehicle. it had lived to share it's music with donald and all the passengers that would enter his vehicle. 

one cold evening in december donald found the ipod in very bad shape. the ipod would not respond to any of the controls and fought valiantly until the last pixel went out. the ipod underwent emergency rechargelectomy and after several attempts came back to life. 

'i was very lucky to receive the ipod as soon as i did. five more minutes and the ipod would've been obsolete. a highly stylish paper weight.' said dr. k.  

the ipod is recovering on donald's desk and being fed intraUSB2.0ly. 
donald could not be reached for comment."

Cause you took apart a picture that wasn't right
Pitch burning on a shining sheet
The only maker that you'd want to meet
The dying man in a living room
Who's shadow paces the floor
He'll take you out any open door
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
Fond farewell to a friend
He said really I just wanna dance
Good and evil matched perfect it's a great romance
I can deal with some physic pain
If it'll slow down my higher brain
Veins full of disappearing ink
Vomiting in the kitchen sink
Disconnecting from the missing link
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
Fond farewell to a friend
I see you're leaving me and taking up with the enemy
The cold comfort of the in between
A little less than a human being
A little less than a happy high
A little less than a suicide
The only things that you really tried
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
Fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend"

i have so many little cuts and scrapes on my hands but the worst ones are on the cuticles...and it hurts like the devil. a new battery for my car wasn't so expensive, but now i dont have the code for my stereo to work - this really sucks. oh and the battery isn't tied down poperly because my fingers hurt from trying to lift that crap battery out from the tight space . i hope the dealership will let me borrow a 10mm socket while they're looking up the code to my stereo. 

someone should bake me cupcakes or find someone to bake me cupcakes. i still havent found any shoes for my sisters wedding so if any of you can help me find a decent pair of black square toe shoes without spending $250+ i'd appreciate it. i should probably eat something before i passout, or all my food spoils.

"event","I have studied your cutlure for the lack of anything better to do, at first i was bored and the i began to find your race to be intresting in your diversity. Oh! yes i almost forgot my name is Abuni. I am of the worrior race called Masagara and we have always fought with other star faring races but then we were attacked by the Lucrecians they were a race of Bueyes in our tounge however in yours they would be called Telepaths and Teleakentics. They have destroyed entire wolds without landing. we were nearly destroyed but some escaped.
My race the Ardanisis have many simularities with yours. We are humanoid except taller we have balck skin, however not black like afrians but a true ebony black that defys light. along with our eyes which are a pale blue."

"event","""good morning Lana"", the silver haired woman said. her crystal blue eyes matched that of a blue diamond and they were filled with such light and energy that it was amazing. Lana's husband was named Nghtwalker and he was lovely with black hair and brown eyes he had an asain cast to his features and was a great contrast to ruby haried green eyed Lana. The silver haired one was as pale as a fine sheet and she appeared to have only just reached adulthood. she had the pose of a virgin goddess and the grace of an angel, she was beautiful with long cascading silver hair down her back in a graceful waterfall pulled back from he face with a silver chain. she wore plain blue robes and looked like a painting of a grandmother without wrinkles. kind and caring like a mother despite the fact that we are even older then her Lana thought. ""Good morning Adria,"" Nightwalker and Lana said together. ""Ah, so Nightwalker you are finally picking up social equette, marvalous darling! i am so proud! and to think i almost gave up hope."" Adria said in a teasing tone of voice. just then her lover appeared from his tower of teaching. he had taught so many of the fledgling wizards as of late that they hadn't had much time to be alone. Painus smiled his shy kind of sad smile and sliped a lovely ring on her finger. it was a purple amesthyst heart dangling from a silver band with diamond chips set within it. she smiled showing him her pleasure from the beautifuly crafted gift. Nightwalker smiled at Lana and a look of knowing passed between them. Panius simply held Adria in his loving arms while she played with his golden hair and stared into his deep sapphire blue eyes. they were a group of mercenarys, they all knew that their next moment could be their last so they made the most of every moment that was experinced. they were vetrans of a few battles and were not all that well known outside the soliders that had survied. those four were great in their own ways. they knew how to command enough to give their ideas on what to do but let their commanders use the ideas as they would.
they never followed orders blindly and always knew what might kill them when they went in. they often changed orders to keep as many of their fellows alive as they could. they were all magic users however descretly but they kept a tower for teaching those who could not get a formal education elsewhere.
many of the mages there were taught more then simply magic. they were taught to be commanders and were taught how to win over hearts and were taught how to create rather then destroy. there were classeshowever and they were defined by the color of their robes. there were the yellow robes that learned nothing but healing and helping others. then there were the green of blance who learned both and applied them equally. fianlly there were the brown robes that were natural born killers at heart who wanted to learn nothing other then the harmful side of magic. all of the teachers were green robes to keep anything bad from happening at the school and in the surrounding countryside. one of our teachers Areil came to our school by chance simply to fall in love for one of the yellow robes who was named Warren. he was nothing extremly specail he had black short curly hair with the prettiest blue eyes you ever could have seen. he was lovely in body as well as in spirit but only had aveage magic skills. Areil was a match for any male if not a better. she had long shimmering red hair and her eyes were almost the color of dancing flames with bubbles of amber through them. she was talk and leithe and well porpotioned se was quick to anger but just as quick to forgive. When they heard of the great war being fought with the kings of both countries trying to recruit the brown robes from their school, Adria was furious and transported everyone back to the tower. She sealed the tower from entry and exit and then forced it in between worlds. 
There were intresting side effects to this spell and she created a portal back to their time for the students who wanted to leave the tower permatly then she informed the rest who had stayed about the effects of the spells. they would live as long as the elves and that they could leave as long as it was only for a week. they could return anytime after that.
""I want to be alone!"" a little girls voice shouted as her mind crumbled ""Why wont they just leave me alone?"" tears streaming down her face. Mellony started to run away from her family but Adria caught herarm and pulled her back to them. ""Darling please come back, wait i love you. I only want the best for you dear.  please let us train your gift. if you let it go wild so will you. i don't want you to go insane please let me help you.""
""NO! NO! NO!i don't want the power it's all your fault! you and dad made me have magic. because of you i have the power, its all your fault. leave me alone you have done enough."" Areil caught ahold of Mellony and slapped her smartly ""Now young lady behave right now!"" Mellony shocked by violence got off her little rant, and Areil paused long enough for mellony to compose herself. 
""Do you really want to leave daughter, do you want to not learn everything you want? you will grow old quick and die young in comparision to the years you would have here. If you want to go out there you will be treated as property or be killed. do you really want to die young and painfully or would you rather be raped?"" Adria was shaking with emtion and inner pain ""you don't have any idea about that world, how cold and cruel it can be, but yet you want out and so you shall go!"" Flicking her fingers towards her daughter she sent her out into the world...

""Mommy lookit!""
""Mommy a lady is in our feild passed out. Mommy!""

""What! Didn't I teach you not to lie? Behave now! Quiet!""

""but mommy i'm not lying I swear I promise that it's true!"""

"event","the man held her tightly to him. they both were rather young in apperace both elves even though not of the same kind. he was a light elf with his bright blue eyes and golden hair was so in love with her and life. she had lumious lavender eyes and silver hair, she was a shadow elf and his lover. their families knew and approved although there was little chance for a union. they were allowed to have this relationship because their parents hoped that both adria and uri would come to understand that they could never truely stay together. for come adrias 30th birthday she would have to leave sunaradale forever and either join her own race or live among one of the others. except that neither light elves or the dark elves would accept a half and half for long. humans would enslave her for her everlasting beauty and with her own kind she would become a warrior."

"event","i awoke and found myself in a strange room in a strange outfit. it was all gold and black and very formal looking. my hair was all tied up and hiden under a scarf in the same colors. my wrists were heavy with gold jewelry as was my neck and ankles. i was on a rather large and soft bed the bedroom had mirrors that moved to follow me as i walked about it. when i mad my way to the dresing table i sat in front of the mirror in shock. for as i had slept someone had done my makeup with an egyptian style that took my rather ordainry features and made them extrodanry. then a man around 20 entered the room he was a handsome man and he knew it though his smile had a cruel aspect to it. and it only got crueler as i stared at him."

"event","We ran through the forest away from our betrothed with naught but a few coins and a spare change of clothing. I felt free as a brid escaping my guilded cage of responiblity and heartache. I had brought my horse moonshadow with me as we ran leading them along. when we had gotten to our first town we split up selling our saddles and buying old ones we also got supplies and weapons. Neko left and went on his way promising to meet up at the palace in one hundred and ninety days. I went into a tavern and started making freinds. I wore normal travelers robes and hid my hair until I had an opppertunity to dye it a diffrent shade.
Inside the tavern I saw a lovely red ead sitting at a table with a black haired fellow with dark eyes. he was talking in a deeply intese voice and the red heads eyes got round with fear as he cocked his arm back to hit her. I caught his hand and snapped his arm before he could react. I caught ahold of the red heads hand and pulled her away from the man which I had decided was one hell of a cruel son of a bitch. I instantly had disliked him. I pushed the woman behind me as the man came forward meanacingly he was a full head taller then me. He obviously looked like a man who got his way no matter what and who disliked his authoritity overthrown. By a woman none the less, a creature that is supposed to be docile and obedenit no matter what happens. Well I supposed he was going to get a severer reality check. I was  niether docile nor obedeint and none the less i was royality and trained by none but the best. I suppose you could call me aggressive but in trruth I wasn't just protective. 
""Why does thou dare to strike a female? In my country you would be currently residing in a pit for such an atrocity."" My speech was perfect but he looked awestruck. Something like as if a rock had spoken or a dog had told him off. I looked at him boldly and told him to ""leave now and not trty to find us. For anywhere you seek us you shall follow with your death swiftly after. Begone or taste my steel and then the shadow elves wrath. My purple eyes glinted with fury and my unbound silver hair shone bodly in the candle light his eyes got wide and he walked out. I sat the lady down and ordered some mead. She looked at me with wide eyesand whispered, ""You are a brave lady shadow el. I would have never even heard of one let alone seen them. Are all shadow elves like you or are you an exception to the rules?"""

"event","he pushed her hair out of her face and brought his lips to hers. he looked into her blue eyes with almost lavender flecks through them. he wispered to her "" I love you Shadow, I have always loved you for who else could be my angel?""
He had silvery blonde hair with bright green eyes. He was once a very passionate leader of a sect of preists until he met Shadow and fell in love. His name was Luther and he had been her first. She was the princess of a small far away country. 
Luther's eyes had caught shadow's the first time she ran into him in her father's home. He had been coming there for her borther and recruiting more men for preists in his temple. but all the passion he used to have went out of him the moment he looked into her blue and lavender eyes.
They were soul bound together"

""My name is Nokerio and I must thank you for protecting me from my mate. It was a forced marriage and I had hated him ever seince I had met him. I knew he was not a kind man but I had never known how unkind his name is Abuni. But I do not wish to be a burden to you so I will leave and try to hide. But thank you for the offer princess Daiji you probly have something you must do.""
""Well in a hundered and ninty-nine days I must be grease at my palace there. but other than that I have no mission if you want to come to my palace then wouldn't mind te company. That is if you don't mind, mind going to greace with a shadow elf princess.

"event","This is a fantasy based world it has many things in common with most fantasy worlds. Also it is very like the midevil times there is no high level of technology nor is it common to read and write let alone know math. The common man is smart but only ever really learn their craft. There are diffrent guilds and diffrent rulers. Along with diffrent fields of magic there will be a world map along with charater pictures along with desriptions up as soon as i can get to it. until i get my lovely artist to draw all these things they will not have pictures. I might draw them but i think i will have my artist do it she is so much better at things like this. but without further ado i shall start writing the prolog. However this story will be written as i go along i might make changes in the story as i go along this is the test version though i think i will write it as if it is being told to someone."

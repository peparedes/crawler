"event","If i just knew sometimes what life had in for me i think that it would be much easier. But then again i think about it and i would have to say that i would rather not know. It just sucks. I just wish someone would just say to me,"" Get on with your life!"" But i have a feeling that thats not going to happen. and if it did would i really get on with it or would i just be heart broken and never be able to move on. Im so lost in myself sometimes that i cant even tell what i really want out of everything. Its just a good thing that i have my iCal to get me through the days. eh.."

"event","my heart for you is pounding so hard and so fast that i cant even breath. I didnt sleep last night b.c i didnt want that picture of you in my head to go away. When you know that your love for someone is greater then your have ever loved, you know that that is the person you would give your life for. you know that that is the person you would be happy with just sitting at home and never doing anything b.c your just so overwhelmed with there smile that nothing else in this world matters.  I would give up everything for you . my life now my friend my truck my cloths my dog just so you would be happy. i would try to make you dinner every night if that what you wanted. you are my everything and more that i cant have. theres no one else in this world that i feel like this for or about. to me your my soul mate that i can
 never touch, and Its a indescribable pain that will never go away."

"event","So I happen to feel really awsome today. witch is a really good thing. With only 2 and 1/2 hours of sleep and going all day i think im doing quite well . I had a amazing night last night. i didnt want it to stop. just dancing with you holding you close, made me feel whole again. it was deff a night to remember. The biting on my lip made my knees weak. The pushing into the wall made me go crazy. With everytime you pushed me away and everytime i walked away i just wanted you even more then before. Last night was filled with hot tention. of wanting and cant having. You should keep me away because you might fall so hard you wont be able to get back up with out my help. and for someone like yourself you dont really like peoples help. I always new you loved dancing and last night proved it. It showed you what you were missing and now we know whats up."

"event","So.. time being.. i was really fucked up last night...i broke my phone.. yes another one. and i was late for class. I woke up and didnt know where i was or what i was doing. my house is trashed. and i have my shirt is backwards. couldnt find my keys . I fund my self running around my house like a chicken with its head cut off.. I fell down the stairs and ill i could do was laugh at myself.  This morning was a bit to much.. but at least im in a good mood. lol... after class i went to the sprint store .. and thank god they were nice.. I mean if i go through phones like i go through money. lol.. they were like it seems like you have had 4 phone in the past 6 mounths. I was like well.... Yeah i guess im hard on  them..  ;o/ but whatever i got a new one yet again. and its red.. man o man.. bright red. lol.. Iv been feeling better so i guess thats good. 

I still miss emily. But i have a date on thursday night. so i guess that a good thing . i mean iv been off and on with her but we live so far apart. so im not sure how thats going to work out. She wants a girlfriend and so do i. but the living so far away is what would kill it. Maybe its better if we wait. dont know. So i talk to emily for the first time in a mounth on thursday night. hmm.. All it did was hurt. i didnt know what to say or do. Seemed lik eshe wanted to talk or try or maybe that way just waht i wanted. but you all know me and im a asshole when im hurt so i just held out my hand and she gave my my neckless back . i shook my head and patted her on the chest and smerked and walked away.  It sucks b/c i would have gave my all to that girl. i still would. The mosts fucked part is that i could take a bullit for her and she wouldnt even notice. she would just keep walking by with her str8 g/f thats fucking her best friend behind her back. Dont you just love life. 


Im trading it up tonight .. hanging out with all str8 people.. lol.. Sadly to say it might just be more fun that way. no gay drama. But dont be fooled str8 drama is if not the same worse.. Im just going to get slamed and make the best of it all. Maybe ill see emily and tell her that on eof them str8 girls is my new girl. lol... i dont even think i can lie to her.  sigh.. i guess ill find out tonight."

i love you very much and i would be anything for you even give you my life even though you wouldnt let me. i can see how much you care and how much it could work out. we both just have to get there. and i think we  will at one point or another. just will take time. in the end it will be ok..just let things keep working.. and one day it will be living happly ever after.

NOTHING.. 


    so now i only have 20 mins before we have to walk out side and put our lives in the hands of god.. the lights just truned on in the plain that im about to go on.. there cheching all the buttens and switches.. people walikng in and out  checking tickets and we still sit here b/c that just happens to be the better thing to do right now.."

 sometimes i feel like im holding her back on things she has /wants to do... and i dont want to do that b/c its killing me... were thinking that if we move in with eachother that it might make it better.. i think we need someone to talk to that could trll us whats going on and how to fix it.. i do love her with all of my heart that wasnt there for a good time.. and now its gone again b/c she has it.. i dont want her to just let me go and walk away.. i think that would hurt more then anything... so do we move in with one and other and hope that things work out or do we hurt the fuck out of us and walk away from something that is so real. or do we just take it one day at a time.. i have never felt like this before... i dont know what t do... should i just start looking for someone else.. god i wish i new.....<br><hr>

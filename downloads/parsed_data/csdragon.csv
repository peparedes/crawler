"event","Ok so I have donw the traveling bit and went to Reno and Southern California. Then Amanda and I have discovered this game geo caching. It great we have been hiking all over the North West treasure hunting. If you have a GPS unit I highly suggest it. www.geocaching.com . As for the work front I was offered a Project Managers position at Intel until they ran a background check, I have a DUII from 2 years ago GRRRRRRRRRRRR Intel will not hire anyone with a record. So I have been hiking my ass off trying not to think about it. Just thought I would check in and say hi to everyone and catch me online."

"event","Ok so Im out to go to the hospital, still worried about that my test results havent come back yet. Anyway I walk in and my new manager Kelly says im no longer needed to help with Supoort Forms Library. WHAT thats my baby I created it nurtured it and on tue half way destroyed it for the better good, on top of that they strip my team from 5 to 2 people and kill half the functionality of the site. Ok so then to make it worse they give me Joe Ketchums team so he can help with reporting... REPORTING Fuck I designed the dynamic reporting pages what the hell then they tell me its going to be in Excel who had a brain fart and came up with this idea ! we have 160,000 customers to close out and were going to report out on Excel. So what it comes down to is that apparently my position was more desirable to someone else who didnt want to deal with agents and I didnt have the in route so bottoms up here comes the ass reaming. I can't believe they are systematicly destroying all the time and effort put into the SFL without even knowing the capabilitys of it, damn I'M PISSED........."

"event","Ok Amanda http://www.livejournal.com/users/sweet_spot/ and I went to see Harry Potter last night. I am amazed at how they a stuck with the story line ""For Those who read as well"". The crowds were low due to the release of 007 this weekend so we had center seats without disturbance from young ones. At first notice there was a RIP in the canvass right at the bridge of Harry's nose but beyond that the stage was set. Harry's Uncle was the epitomy of asshole and the House Elf was well done but a bit on the masochistic side. I especially liked the Ford Angelia flying car. The Special Effects were extremely well done wait until you see the Basilisk. I starting having problems 2 hrs in my ass went numb from the seats, hint: Bring a pillow. Overall the movie represented my imagination well from reading the book and kept all the nuances from the story. It's a must see on the big screen because home viewing won't give the Basilisk its due."

"event","Ok to start the interface on this thing sucks ! With that out of the way I could like it here. Im getting Amanda up and ready to join in as soon as she figures out a name :^) .... Could be interesting. I had one hell of a day today 4 hours of meetings back to back and Im getting sick of defending my baby. Oh well I think it will fly once everyone sees things my way HAHA. Were going to see Harry Potter tonight I hope it depends on the lines. I give a review if anyone is interested. On a good note my site is growing in leaps and bounds I like that the people we get uploading the better so let me know if need access. Thats it for my first entry bye."

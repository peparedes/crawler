"event","Most years I resolve to lose weight or do something else ""perfectly"". I guess I am getting older and wiser because I now know that neither of those things make very good resolutions. I always fail miserably and feel like crap because of it. So this year I've decided to dedicate&nbsp;the year to discovery. I want to know more about who I am and what I can do. I want to try new things, talk to new people and mostly believe that if I want it and work for it enough then I can have it. I want to learn to tell people how much they mean to me without fear that they will reject me and I want to be able to separate myself from those that hurt me. I want to treat my body with the respect it deserves, afterall..hasn't it been through enough? I want to make the most out of every opportunity that is handed to me, and follow through on the things that the key people in my life believe I am capable of. I want to be a good friend, and I want to make myself and those close to me happy. Here's to a new year, full of things undiscovered!"

"event","There is a lot going through my head tonight. I am loving school, loving the constant schedules, the exhaustion at the end of the day, the need to be in bed by 10 or I feel like I'm going to die. I love that, at least it means I'm going to sleep that night. Working out everyday while at school feels good too. I keep trying to find ways to improve my workouts, make them more effective, more beneficial to me without going overboard. I know I do that. It scares me a little because I love this feeling so very much. Its come over into my food too. I no&nbsp;longer want to eat junk food. If I want some sort of snack food thing I go for all natural things. Even my cheese puffs have been replaced with Pirtates Booty from the whole foods store. I measure out my healthy cereal and milk, have a banana and pack lunch for school every morning. I have my yogurt, organic juice box, water and veggies for lunch and then have a healthy dinner. Its so easy to do during the week. Weekends are much harder since I have all that unstructured time. But then, its only been a week, we shall see how it continues as the semester goes on.&nbsp;

So far this week I have worked out yesterday, went to my physical conditioning class today, where we did step aerobics, &nbsp;and did the tiny tots class with Jade. Tomorrow I need to go to the gym to do my lab assignment that includes running 1/2 mile. Then I'll do my three dance classes later that night. Thursday we are supposed to run 1 1/2 miles for a timed run and I know my time is going to be awful since I will be walking for most of it. I simply cannot run that far yet. If I had stuck to my early summer plan I would have been in a 5k last weekend...but I didn't so no running for me just yet. We shall see what comes of tomorrow and the future timed runs scheduled for this class. Then friday is another workout at the gym. I want to lose weight, and increase my endurance so I can be more active in life. Getting tired so easily sucks. My fitness professor is 39 and looks like she is younger than I am...that is motivation right there, if I can look half as good as she does when I'm her age I'll be doing pretty damned well. OK..time to finish up and go to sleep. I'm a tired girl tonight."

"event","<p>Quick run down of my week since I am so incredibly tired right now...</p>
<p>Monday- Went shopping for school, helped organize the studio, then hung out with a friend for a few hours. Couldn't sleep because I was excited about classes starting the next day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tuesday- First day of the semester! I had ASL first. I like it a lot and it turns out my cousin's former foster child is in my class. I love that girl so it will be a lot of fun to see her twice a week. Then I had Physical Conditioning. The first half was lecture and the second half we did pilates. Of course nobody knew that we would be working out the first day and we were all wearing normal clothes. I had nice jeans, a nice top, heels and my hair was actually done..sooooo not pilates clothes..but I did my best. Then I had to run across campus to meet my dad so he could bring me to the studio in time for Tiny Tots. I assisted with Jade and then was picked up again so I could go to my therapy appointment. After that I came home, did homework and went to bed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Wednesday- First class was Botany. Turns out my ASL professor is taking that class as well. So I'll be seeing lots of her. At least in there she has interperaters, in asl there aren't any, so it is easy to communicate. After that class I had a long break and then it was time for Human Development. Its an OK class. Not great not bad..just ok. Once class was done I caught the bus home to do homework so I could get to dance in time. Dance was fun too. It was the first week and our class is much smaller this year. I kind of like it that way though. Much more mellow. Dance got out at 9:45pm and I came home and went to bed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thursday- Botany Lab started at 8am! Ugh..that was cool. We planted seeds and took cuttings of plants. I like hands on things. You will never guess who my Lab partner is...MY ASL PROFESSER! Weird eh? At least I'll get to practice my signing a bit. Then I had ASL and Physical Conditioning where we did aerobics. I am really out of shape...but that will improve. After that class I decided to use the eliptical cross trainer for 20 minutes before leaving.&nbsp;Then I came home did homework and went to bed by 9:15. I was exhausted.<br /><br />Friday- Got up early so I could get to therapy by 8:30am! Then Botany, which was ok. After that was Adolecent Psych which I really enjoyed. I think that will be one of my favorite classes. I know the professer in real life as she was my dance teacher when I was a little girl. Not the mean one that told me to lose weight, but the nice one that really took me under her wing and tried to make my life better because she knew things were hard at home. So having her for a teacher again is pretty cool. She didnt realize I was in her class until she saw me and she was pretty surprised but excited too.&nbsp;Then I had Human Development and went to the gym for an hour. I got to talk to Jane for a few minutes today too which was nice. She said I seem so much happier and healthier this year, I hope she is right. Honestly I'm not sure if I'm happier..maybe at school yes, but I hope healthier..I am trying to take better care of myself.&nbsp;<br /><br />OK..so maybe that wasn't so short. Now i want to sleep..its really early but I'm not used to such a crazy schedule yet and I really want to go to the mall tomorrow and get some workout clothes. TTFN!</p>"

Someone with better layers that have been thinned a bit and less length as well. Perhaps even some longish bangs. I dunno, I just know I'm sick and tired of the same look I've had forever now and I need a change. I really hope she can get me in..she does Debbies hair so nicely, maybe I'd have half a chance of getting something that looks marginally ok?"

"event","I've been a crap friend lately and haven't commented on anyones entries but I swear I'm reading. I just don't know what to say to those that need a kind word or how to express joy for those that are doing well. I'm so stuck in my own head that nothing seems to be good enough.&nbsp;

Tomorrow I need to go to school to try and get into another class. They cancelled my stats class that I need to take so I can graduate in the spring. The website says there isn't another one..which sucks, so I have to find out if I can take a normal stats class (aka..stats for smart people..ugh) in its place or if I'm going to be transferring without my associates degree in a year. I'm also going to check and see if I can buy my books tomorrow. It would be nice to get it out of the way while I'm there already.&nbsp;

After that is therapy and then dinner with my dad."

"event","<p>I'm going home today! I can't wait to see my sweet Bailey. She probably hates me by this point for leaving her yet again but I will be thrilled to death to see her. I also can't wait to see Curtis, he grows and changes so much in just a weeks time, I'm sure I've missed something important (like him going off to college or walking on the moon or something big like that). I swear if he learned to walk while I was gone I'll be so sad. </p>
<p>Ok, time to feed the dogs and pack up my stuff. They will be home around 2 and I want the house to look really nice when they get here. </p>"

"event","I need to get out of bed and start the day, but I'm having one of those mornings where I feel it would be better to hide and just not face life. I don't think I'm depressed and I don't feel overly anxious, just tired I guess. Physically I feel like I've been beat up and I just want to stay in bed. A dreamless sleep would be the perfect way to spend today. Can't do it though, I have to feed the dogs, shower and get dressed and be at therapy by noon. Just that little bit seems exhausting."

"event","All I did today was knit, take care of the dogs and water my aunt's eight million plants. Oh..and stand there with hose in hand for half an hour each for the front and back lawn.&nbsp; I'm a slow knitter but my bag is coming along. I've finished the bottom and am on row 37 out of 88 rows for the body of the<br />bag. Nearly half way there. Then I have to make the straps, felt it, needle felt a design to the outside and then line the entire thing. <sup>not much right? </sup>Oh, I really hope it turns out as well as I've imagined it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I should blog about something worth while but really I'd rather avoid my thoughts and feelings right now thank you very much. My body hurts, I'm tired all of the time and I've just found out for the fifth time that my insurance company will not pay for my migraine meds. They want me to try depicote but I won't because its a mood stabalizer and one of the side effects that most people get is major weight gain. I can't afford to gain anymore i'm big as it is. Hopefully my dr will keep fighting for it and in the mean time give me samples to keep the headaches at bay. If not then I'm going to be in a lot of pain again, and that would really suck. <br />"

"event","I started working on my bag late last night. It was my main source of distraction today and its coming along nicely. The entire thing should only take a couple of weeks I'd guess. With breaks of course. Maybe less since I have so much time to myself for the next few days. i can just sit and knit to my little hearts content. So far it doesnt' look like I'll use up nearly as much yarn as the pattern says I needed to buy. Of course I bought one more ball then it said I needed just to be sure and I'm wondering if I bought a whole bunch of chocolate brown wool for nothing. But then if I do have a bunch left over I can make something else with it. There are some fingerless gloves that I'd like to try and I could always make a matching coin purse and cellphone cozy to match my bag. They would be lined with the same as-yet-to-be-decided fabric as the bag.&nbsp;

I really should be sleeping..the dogs will surely wake me up and some un-Godly hour and want to be let out. TTFN!"

"event","<p>Today I have done some laundry, fed and taken care of the dogs and watched way too much tv for my own good. Is the week almost over yet? Seriously, I'm bored.&nbsp;<br /><br />Last night I woke up in the middle of the night feeling kind of sick. I was laying in bed when I suddenly felt like I was going to pass out, except that I was already laying down. If I had been standing I would have hit the floor like a ton of bricks. I feel fine today aside from the pain in my ribs that won't go away. Nothing is wrong with me so the pain can just stop already.<br /><br />School starts in a couple of weeks..I can't wait to see my friends again. </p>"

<p>Add the bordem to the guilt and boy have we got a great combo going. My yarn didn't come in so I can't get a start on the bag i want to make. I did start the laundry and I have to feed/let out the dogs several times a day. Oh..and I can't forget the hour each evening standing outside with a hose in my hand making sure the flowers and grass gets watered well enough. I brought some art stuff, dvds and my computer to try and stay entertained. </p>
<p>for now though, its time to sleep. nite all. </p>"

Not only do I have to be up but I have to be in a good mood and be prepared to dance and be with children for the entire day when I haven't got any sleep. Then I have to be able to handle what promises to be a very rough therapy session before going to dinner with my dad. God grant me the grace. Please..grace or sleep..or both...please. </p>"

"event","I spent most of today in Otis with my family swimming and boating and such. Austin was so cute calling the Lake a pool and wanting to dig in the sand. It was just nice to spend time with everyone relaxing. We had a bbq and now i'm exhausted.&nbsp;

Tomorrow is dance camp. I have four kids. Two that are five, one that is seven and one that's eleven. I got a craft for tomorrow, a bunch of fun charms for them to earn for their necklaces and now I need to think about sleeping so I can have the energy to dance for five hours. I honestly didn't think we'd get enough kids but our minimum is four and we got four. There is a possibility of two more by tuesday but we shall see. TTFN!"

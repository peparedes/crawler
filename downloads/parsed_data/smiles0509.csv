Me and Ronald have broken up.

Yeah.&nbsp; Last week, we decided that things between us have just changed.&nbsp; We're not happy anymore... the distance is just too much.&nbsp; I've been trying to give him the space he wanted.&nbsp; I've cried.&nbsp; I've been mad.&nbsp; I've cried some more.&nbsp; And now, I think I see that maybe it's just time for us both to try to move on.&nbsp; This whole long distance thing is so tough.&nbsp; We just end up hurting each other so much.&nbsp; Maybe it's for the best.&nbsp; Ronald said he wanted to talk when I came home for Thanksgiving to see if we could work things out.&nbsp; After this time apart, I think it will be for the best if we just go our separate ways.&nbsp; I really love Ronald.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; But maybe we can pick things up in a couple of years when we can actually be together in the same city.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; It's heart-breaking.&nbsp; In the end, it'll be for the best.&nbsp; Hopefully we can still be friends.&nbsp; It sounds cheesy, but I really hope it's true.&nbsp; We share a lot of the same friends and we've had some awesome times together and I just don't want to be angry with each other.&nbsp; I hope we can eventually be friends.&nbsp; I really do.

sigh.

Sadness and anger come and go every hour.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel okay.&nbsp; Others, I need him.&nbsp; Then, I'm okay and we'll move on.&nbsp; I guess it'll be like this for awhile.&nbsp; But I think I'll be fine.

I've had the girls to help me through it all.&nbsp; They are super.&nbsp; Awesome.&nbsp; :)

Hard to imagine me and Ron not together.
I love him.
I've never stopped.
Things are just too much right now.
Maybe one day will be our day.
Until then...
Make the best of things, I guess."

"event","..and I hold back the tears.

Life is amazing.&nbsp; When you're born into the world, you don't really know what's going on.&nbsp; Sure, people have talked to you since the day you were conceived, saying things to make you feel at home, giving you an optimistic view on life.&nbsp; And when you cry that first cry, you don't know, but it just never stops.&nbsp; The crying never really stops.

Because I feel that way right now.&nbsp; I hold back all these tears to make it through the day and when I end up in my bed, it's eleven thirty and all I can do is wipe away tears until I slowly fall into a dreamless (hopefully) sleep.&nbsp; I wake up and my cheeks are stained with little tear rivers, but I cover them up with makeup and that makes everything okay.&nbsp; For today.

Tears come from all sorts of things, but mine come from my soul.&nbsp; It's broken.&nbsp; It's not strong enough to hold the distance, it's not strong enough to stand up to the fierce winds of November, it's not what it used to be.&nbsp; It's weak and unnerving.&nbsp; So, I cry.&nbsp; I cry because of things I can change and don't.&nbsp; Of places I want to be and of all the things I've done wrong that cannot be changed.&nbsp; I cry because I cry so much.&nbsp; I cry because I know I could be stronger than this if I had everything I needed in close proximity.&nbsp; I cry because I am so broken, there is nothing left in me but tears.

And it's November.&nbsp; We are going on three years of being in a relationship.&nbsp; We were so young when it started and our lives have fallen into place and we're who we're going to be for the rest of our lives.&nbsp; We've been so happy and so in love.&nbsp; And even when you're far away, I know that I love you.&nbsp; I know that you make me complete.&nbsp; But I am so scared that it will be ripped away in that matter of a heart beat, that I just cry.&nbsp; Long drives usually soothe my soul, but that last drive, I think, emptied it.&nbsp; I came back to my empty apartment and realized that whatever I had, I don't anymore.&nbsp; And that scares me to my bitter core.&nbsp; I am physically upset because you are far away from me.&nbsp; And I just don't want to lose you to time and distance.&nbsp; I just don't want to lose you.

When you are far from me, I try to find a place for myself in this little bubble world I've created.&nbsp; And I usually get along just fine, making this life my own and claiming everything is wonderful because if you say something for so long, you start to believe it.&nbsp; But when I'm in your arms, I know that whatever it is that I've created here is fake.&nbsp; When I'm in your arms, I know that that is what is real.&nbsp; That is true love and comfort.&nbsp; And I get back here and sometimes, I can't fit back into this puzzle.&nbsp; Truth prevails and I just don't belong here.&nbsp; Somedays, I don't belong anywhere.&nbsp; Then, what do I have left?&nbsp; An empty soul and enough tears to fill my pillow until I finally drift off...

I've never loved someone so much.&nbsp; I really haven't.&nbsp; I think of you constantly.&nbsp; I wish you were with me.&nbsp; I wish that we were together and eventhough I know you hate my wishing, I still do it.&nbsp; I love you more than anyone can ever imagine.&nbsp; Because you understand me.&nbsp; And if you can't understand me, you accept that.&nbsp; And love me anyhow.&nbsp; I know that I love you because when I'm with you, everything in my world sparkles.&nbsp; Everything is good; everything is awsome.&nbsp; Love is so strange and wonderful, and I love the way you laugh at things that aren't funny and the way you smile that smile even when you're mad at me.&nbsp; I love everything about you.&nbsp; Everything.

Seems we've been fighting a lot more lately.&nbsp; Some nights are longer than others, fighting over things that would easily be solved if we were closer to each other.&nbsp; And I am the jealous type.&nbsp; I want to know that I have all of you, all the time.&nbsp; And I don't like to share.&nbsp; And I know you are the opposite type, you give and give and give to other people because that is just who you are.&nbsp; You don't mean anything by it.&nbsp; But we clash on some topics and after so long of being away from each other, it seems everything is easier to break now.&nbsp; We may be so resentful that we're unconscience of how we can truly hurt each other.&nbsp; But apology after apology, we always come back. Always.&nbsp; Because what we have has been built on what must be a sturdy foundation that this is it.&nbsp; That there is no way no other person or thing will split us up.&nbsp; That we are going to make it because our feelings are so strong for one another.&nbsp; So, some days are harder than others, but we have always made it through.&nbsp; It's just me and you.&nbsp; Just me and you.

And eventhough those fights are hard on both of our hearts, we still come through it all.&nbsp; I know that in the end, no one will ever be able to understand and love me the way you do.&nbsp; How you can tell exactly what I'm thinking, no matter how random or off topic I am.&nbsp; How you can hold me close at night to make me feel safe when the world hasn't been so kind.&nbsp; How when I cry, you can stop the tears from falling from eight hours away.&nbsp; You are so much a part of me.&nbsp; I can't imagine my life without you.&nbsp; And I don't want to.&nbsp; I just want to keep this together until we're sitting in old rocking chairs, reminscing about the way things used to be.&nbsp; And I'll tell you I knew all along the ways things would be, and you'll laugh the way you always do and life will be perfect, the way it's supposed to be, just you and me.

Times like these I don't know what I need to be consoled.&nbsp; I just need to know that what I have isn't going anywhere.&nbsp; That whole-heartily, we will make it through these rough patches and life will be good again.&nbsp; I need to know that who I am is a part of who you are and that our life together will be simply amazing, the way I usually believe on optimistic days.&nbsp; And I need to be reassured that no matter how far from you I am, that you'll always love me, and only me for the rest of our lives.&nbsp; That we're gonna be okay.&nbsp; That life is full of ups and downs and twists and turns and all these things will come and go, but we will remain.&nbsp; No matter what.&nbsp; And I need you to tell me that you're not going anywhere, no matter how many tears I cry.&nbsp; I just need you.&nbsp; And if that doesn't work, just listen to me cry.&nbsp; Because no one else will.&nbsp; Because having you on the other end of the line makes me feel better.&nbsp; Just be you.

Or remind me of how we fell in love.&nbsp; Because that story always (always) makes me smile.

And thank you.&nbsp; For being there for me when life is so difficult.&nbsp; And helping me through things that maybe you don't understand.&nbsp; And thank you for loving me the way you always have, even when things are difficult.&nbsp; I just want you to know that I appreciate you in every single tiny way possible.&nbsp; And I love you in all ways imaginable.

My heart aches for you.&nbsp; And it seems that I can feel it.&nbsp; It hurts.

And I still don't know what is going on in this world.&nbsp; Not since the day I was born.&nbsp; But when life is a rush of tears, we have to remember that some of them may be good, happy tears.&nbsp; And if you think that a baby cries because of happiness, it makes the world seem brighter.&nbsp; Because if you are happy entering the world, I believe, life will be a flood of joyful tears mixed with some times of sadness.&nbsp; And I'm sad today, but I want to believe that tomorrow, I will be happy.

I love you so much."

"event","Okay, so I've been writing in my journal lately, but I just feel like typing today.

I am so confused.&nbsp; I don't know if Ronald is cheating on me.&nbsp; I know he has hung out with Dallas, that stupid whore, and not told me, but I just don't know if he's cheated on me.&nbsp; I saw this picture of her on myspace and she is on our couch, I swear to God.&nbsp; And, did he tell me that she came over?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; So, what am I supposed to say?&nbsp; Oh, I stalked that whore because i can't trust you and will you please just tell me the truth?&nbsp; I mean, things have been shaky with us ever since the summer ended.&nbsp; I just don't understand.&nbsp; I called Edgar like two hours ago and he talked to me about it.&nbsp; He said that he did hear that Ron and Dallas had hung out but he didn't hear if they had hooked up or whatever.&nbsp; He said he'd keep an eye out for me if he heard anything.&nbsp; After we got off that topic, we actually talked for like an hour about stuff.&nbsp; He really calmed me down and we talked about the good ole days when everything was more simple.&nbsp; He made me feel special&nbsp; :)&nbsp; He said don't worry about Dallas really until there is something to worry about.&nbsp; He said maybe Ron just wants to spend some time with a girl because he misses having a girl around the house or something to that affect.&nbsp; I just wish he would TELL me because it seems awfully shady.&nbsp; And I told Edgar I had gone through his Myspace and crap but he seemed to understand and he told me I'm not a horrible girlfriend or anything, so I feel better.&nbsp; But here it is at 4 AM&nbsp; and when I click on that whore's picture I just think of him touching her and then touching me and I can't help but tear up.&nbsp; And I don't even know that it went on, but I just feel like I want to throw up.&nbsp; I don't want to believe that Ronald would cheat on me, but he's told me before that sex is just an itch you have to scratch sometimes.&nbsp; I just don't know.&nbsp; I won't say anything to him about it because I know he'll have an excuse for anything and everything I say and somehow I'll end up crying and alone.&nbsp; He didn't even talk to me tonight.&nbsp; He just went to bed....

It just feels different since the summer.&nbsp; Different.

The highlight was getting to talk to Edgar.&nbsp; During the summer, we hung out like every weekend, but at the same time, we didn't get to spend that much time alone together because of Ron and Sarah and all the history, blahblahblah.&nbsp; So, we talked about this summer and how we missed each other and how everything was so wonderful when we got to see each other.&nbsp; We talked about Valentine's Day our senior year and that stupid, embarrasing lyrical heart-puzzle thing I gave him.... LOL, and he gave me a dozen roses.&nbsp; For once, I felt like Edgar really was comfortable on the phone and enjoyed talking with me and didn't mind that I cried a little bit when I was talking about Ronald.&nbsp; And he didn't call Ronald a cheater off the bat or anything to put him down.&nbsp; He just really cares about my well-being and I appreciate that in a friend.&nbsp; We talked about relationships and the difficulties we're both having and stuff, but we ended on a good note:&nbsp; that we should talk more often and be happy, you know.&nbsp; It was just nice to have my best friend back.&nbsp; I feel like when I'm with Ron that I can't see Edgar by myself because he'll think I'm running around on him or something.&nbsp; But, you know what, I am going out with him to a movie or something when I'm in town for Thanksgiving because he has been such a great friend to me.&nbsp; Especially tonight.

:)&nbsp; Thank God for good friends and pray that I'm not being cheated on....."

I was very upset about nothing at all... just the summer ending.&nbsp; Emotional, you know.<br /><br />Summer break was <strong>amazing</strong>.&nbsp; I mean, GOD, waking up every single day in Ronald's arms was like heaven.&nbsp; Going to sleep feeling his deep breaths on my neck made my heart just sink.&nbsp; We adopted Aurora, our kitten in May.&nbsp; Her b-day is March 21st.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Gosh, she is SOOO cute!!&nbsp; I love her so much.&nbsp; She is pretty evil and we went through a whole flea phase, but as she is getting bigger, she is getting much better.&nbsp; I love her so so so much!!&nbsp; And Jesse graduated this summer.&nbsp; He got his Associate's Degree in computer programming.&nbsp; He got a very good job in Memphis.&nbsp; So, he moved in with Mom and Dad while Jessica finishes her last year at North Ark.&nbsp; I think he likes it so far.&nbsp; I was so proud of him!!&nbsp; He got outstanding graduate.&nbsp; Fancy!&nbsp; Then, we had like a party every weekend at Ron's place.&nbsp; I got to see all my friends all summer.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; I missed being in the same room with people who knew me, who knew exactly how to handle me.&nbsp; And I loved it so much!&nbsp; I met a few new people this summer that are totally awesome!&nbsp; Will, Becca, and Matt.&nbsp; They are pretty cool.&nbsp; Eight of us went to Sardis, MS and camped for a couple of days.&nbsp; That was cool.&nbsp; Ronald actually cooked while we there!!&nbsp; It was yummy.&nbsp; That was a great trip.&nbsp; Ohhh, and I can't forget that Star Wars marathon.&nbsp; I have watched all SIX of the Star Wars movies.&nbsp; And, you can't tell Ron, but I liked it... sorta.&nbsp; Okay, okay.&nbsp; Anyhow, I actually watched a lot of movies this summer.&nbsp; My favoirtes were Transformers [really cool] and my new fave--Pan's Labyrinth.&nbsp; So cool.&nbsp; Woah.&nbsp; And Ronald moved into his new apartment over near Wolfchase.&nbsp; Oh, and I worked at Party Works all summer.&nbsp; I didn't particularly care for the job too much, but it was easy and paid all right.&nbsp; I probably won't go back next summer, though, if I don't have to.&nbsp; I kept in touch with Lesa from the hotel here.&nbsp; I actually helped with housekeeping today, my first day back in JC.&nbsp; I had a blast!&nbsp; I just love working at the hotel.&nbsp; And, hopefully soon, I will be working at the front desk.&nbsp; Cassondra is having her baby [for real this time!] in a few weeks (or maybe earlier) and I'll be taking over for her.&nbsp; I hope Lesa can put me into the schedule because after this summer, I am BROKE.&nbsp; I mean, I must have spent wayy too much money this summer.&nbsp; Oh well, though.&nbsp; You can always earn more money, you know.&nbsp; This summer was the best summer of my life.&nbsp; I had such a wonderful time.&nbsp; Yeah, there were days when I missed JC or when me and Ron would fight, but overall, summer was sweet.&nbsp; I saw my mom and dad quite a bit.&nbsp; Jacob and Derek and Jesse, too.&nbsp; I got a new grill on my Volvo!!&nbsp; And I fixed the light in the back.&nbsp; And the dimmer switch.&nbsp; It's almost like new now!!&nbsp; I was excited.&nbsp; I drove up yesterday.&nbsp; I was super-tired, but Elle came up and then we went to see Pandora (who just moved to the city).&nbsp; Then, Lamanda came home and we talked for awhile and went to eat at Krystal's.&nbsp; It was a good way to start the beginning of the semester.&nbsp; Elle, Pandora and I just got back from dinner.&nbsp; School starts on Monday.&nbsp; I am super-nervous, but kind of excited.&nbsp; Only two more years, yay!&nbsp; Brent says Hello.... Random, but I just noticed that I hadn't mentioned him all entry and I don't want him to be left out.&nbsp; He is super fluffy and cuteness now.&nbsp; Aurora loves him.&nbsp; Anyhow, I miss summer.&nbsp; We had so much fun [and sooo much to drink, lol].&nbsp; For our two year anniversary, Ronald gave me a digital picture frame.&nbsp; It is really, really cool.&nbsp; We went to Shogun for dinner which was pretty cool.&nbsp; The guy cooked right infront of us!&nbsp; I can't believe it's been two whole years since Ronald and I started dating.&nbsp; I love that man so much.&nbsp; He is everything to me.&nbsp; I almost couldn't let go.&nbsp; All I saw infront of me was my life falling apart as I drove onto that highway.&nbsp; But, we are strong.&nbsp; Stronger than ever now.&nbsp; I think this summer is really going to help me get through this semester.&nbsp; I feel like Ronald and I are a lot closer now. I feel like I know him better now, like I trust him more than ever, and I love him more than ever.&nbsp; I think that will help me get through the long nights away from each other.&nbsp; I hope I can see him soon, though!&nbsp; I hope he lets me love him for the rest of my life.&nbsp; &lt;3<br /><br />All in all, AWSOME.<br />"

Summer has been pretty great.&nbsp; I've been staying with Ronald since I got into town.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; We've been partying like every weekend and have had a wonderful time.&nbsp; I just don't want to go....

Today is Ronald and I's 2 year anniversary.&nbsp; Of course, I've already gotten him something and was so excited about spending the rest of the weekend together [[our last weekend before I leave]] and Ronald seems to me like he hasn't even thought twice about it.&nbsp; For one, he hasn't even thought about my present... and I spent all that time trying to really pick something out that I think he would enjoy.&nbsp; Two, he's decided to have a family meeting about Denice [who was in a car wreck the other day.&nbsp; She was drunk.&nbsp; And stupid] on Saturday.&nbsp; I told him that Saturday is supposed to be our day.&nbsp; You know?&nbsp; Denice doesn't need a family meeting.&nbsp; She needs to wake herself up and start doing something with her life.&nbsp; They can't force her to do something about a problem she doesn't even think she has.&nbsp; Gah, it just makes me so mad.&nbsp; I've tried to be there for him, but enough is enough.&nbsp; This is our LAST weekend together before I go back and it's not even important to him.&nbsp; I'm just so upset.&nbsp; And, he can't take off to help me go back next week, but heaven knows he would call in two days this week because of his family.&nbsp; And I can understand that his family is important and I would want him to be with them.&nbsp; But when I asked him before all this happened if he could call in to come with me, he said no because he doesn't have any time, blahblahblah.&nbsp; I am always number two.&nbsp; For our anniversary, I just wanted to be number one.&nbsp; Is that so much to ask?&nbsp; I don't even care if I sound unreasonable anymore.&nbsp; I could just cry my eyes out for the next week and still have enough tears leftover to fill a canyon.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't want to leave.&nbsp; And he just thinks I'm a selfish baby.

I think there's something wrong with me!&nbsp; I had to leave APS early yesterday because I was throwing up.&nbsp; I came home and slept for hours and felt a little better.&nbsp; I never get sick, what is going on?&nbsp; Blah.&nbsp; I felt bad earlier today, but I think I'm better.&nbsp; I just wish this would go away.&nbsp; My stomach just has these pains and ... I don't know.&nbsp; I feel like a baby.&nbsp; I hate feeling sick.

I have to go get a PAP done this week.&nbsp; No fun.&nbsp; I'm scared a little!!

I feel so bad for Elle.&nbsp; She's had a bad week.&nbsp; Her stepdad had a heart attack.&nbsp; Then, she had to have oral surgey.&nbsp; And to top the week off, her car battery died.&nbsp; I feel bad&nbsp; :(&nbsp; I know that her missing all that class couldn't be good, either.&nbsp; Poor Elle.

The Volvo's headlights went out completely.&nbsp; Fun, no.&nbsp; The brights are working still.&nbsp; Actually, now I can't get them to go off.&nbsp; It's funny but also really sad.&nbsp; I might get it looked at this weekend.

Which brings me to work.&nbsp; Lesa fired Chae Lee this week.&nbsp; She was really, really upset.&nbsp; Then, Angela quit on Tuesday.&nbsp; So after Spanish on Tuesday night, I went over and stayed to close up for Lesa since she had been working all day.&nbsp; Sarah's son Donnie is supposed to be coming this weekend to work nights.&nbsp; That's always good.&nbsp; We'll have to hire someone.&nbsp; Probably a few someones.&nbsp; Especially before I leave for summer!

I'm just SOO ready for school to be out so I can go home.&nbsp; I got rejected for the English department scholarships, boo.&nbsp; That makes me feel like crap.&nbsp; Yeah.

Just one month and it all will be over.&nbsp; I have like six papers to write.&nbsp; Ulllllghhh.

But, now, I get to go fold linen for eight hours.&nbsp; Ohh, the joys of life.

And btw, it's spring and 41 degrees outside with a chance of snow tonight.

Come on, Mother Nature, give us some warm sunshine!!&nbsp; It's April for gosh sakes.

"event","Yeahhh... it's 3 something in the morning, but I can't sleep.&nbsp; So... an update.

Me and my mom have had things out.&nbsp; She kept implying that Ronald is some absuive, controlling boyfriend.&nbsp; So, I just stopped talking with her for the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; She sent me an e-mail saying that she was just looking out for me, blah blah blah.&nbsp; So I called her tonight and I told her how much that insulted me and Ronald because he is a GREAT guy that would never lay a finger on me.&nbsp; Wherever she got the idea that he was anything but perfect for me is beyond me.&nbsp; She must have misunderstood a joke or something.&nbsp; Probably heard something she wasn't supposed to, you know.&nbsp; She said that she wasn't going to say her opinions anymore unless asked and that's fine with me.&nbsp; I don't need her telling me things that are not true.&nbsp; You know who actually knows what's going on in my life?&nbsp; Me.&nbsp; That's who.&nbsp; So, no, mother, I don't need your advice on this one.&nbsp; Thanks anyway.&nbsp; We're al okay now, but it just really rubs me (and Ronald, for the matter) the wrong way because she couldn't even tell me what it was that brought her to this conclusion.&nbsp; So whatever.

Anyways, I had to go home early last night at work because I was so sick.&nbsp; That was not fun!&nbsp; I hate being sick.&nbsp; But I am feeling much better today, so it's all okay!&nbsp; yay!&nbsp; Ronald was so sweet to me when I wasn't feeling well.&nbsp; How sweet.

Ronald and I are meeting this weekend!!&nbsp; Yay!!

Sooo... I'm going to Memphis for the summer.&nbsp; Yepp.&nbsp; I am really excited!!&nbsp; I am going to work there during the summer.&nbsp; I just need to be home with someone who LOVES me.&nbsp; I really do.&nbsp; I hate that I have to leave ACS, but you know.&nbsp; It's really important to me.&nbsp; Hopefully, they will take me back in August.&nbsp; Otherwise, I'll just find some place else to work.&nbsp; I'll figure something out, of course.&nbsp; But I am sooo excited I get to be home for so long!!&nbsp; Woohoo!!

Just four weeks of school left.&nbsp; We are registering for classes soon.&nbsp; Already!!&nbsp; I know I will have some classes with some girls I know, so that will be pretty cool.&nbsp; yay!

This semester is winding up pretty well so far.&nbsp; I may be able to pull off A's if I don't get lazy!&nbsp; I need to be writing a paper.&nbsp; Ha.

Actually, lots of papers... lol

Well, I think the NyQuil is kicking in.&nbsp; Maybe I can get some sleep.

unusally warm in the middle of february,
but i welcome the warm weather
'cause you will be here in just days
and i know you can bear the cold,
but your smile shines so bright
when the sun hangs high in the sky
(especially during summertime).

i love how
when i run to you
with tears and fears
and all the things that
make me afraid to sleep at night
and when i ramble on
about the ways of the world
and all the things
i'm so scared of doing wrong
because i'm not the person
i always believe i am
you're always right there
to hold me up
when i fall down
and dry my tears
if i can't do anything
but cry it out.

and i'm not afraid
of spending my life with you
knowing you are
my best friend
my other half,
the man i was
meant to be with.

i will light one candle.

and i promise you this:

when life is so hard
and treats you so cruely,
when all you can do
is hide in your room
and your thoughts aren't so clear
and your life is so
cloudy,
when all your days
are rainy and nasty
and life hasn't worked out
just as you planned it.
when you can't hurdle
what is thrown infront of you
and the horizon seems so far off
from the place where you started,
and the race to what you want
doesn't seem like it's worth it,
and if you miss your chance
to become something great,
and you nightmare over
anything,
when lights are all faded
and no one is around,
when life feels so meaningless
that you don't want to wake up,
when it's hard to see the end
because you've had such a rough start,
when hilltops
become mountain tops
and fights become battles,
when life hands you lemons
and you hate lemonade,
when you taste sour grapes
and forfeit the game.
when your white flag waves
and you just want to be alone,
when you need a shoulder
and when you need a friend,
know that i'll be here
for the rest of your life,
'cause when bad times arise
and you can't find a way out--
know that i'll hold you,
that i'll be here til the end
because you aren't just my
one true love,
you are also
my best friend."

Then, we made love.&nbsp; ^_^&nbsp; It was <u>amazing</u>.&nbsp; I mean--awesome.&nbsp; So, we went to dinner at O'Charley's.&nbsp; We threw a few snowballs and I swear he makes my world just light up like a city at Christmas.&nbsp; My whole world just lifted when I was in his arms.&nbsp; He looked SO handsome and I felt like the most special girl in the world when I held his hand.&nbsp; Then, we came back to the hotel after dinner and curled up in all the warmness.&nbsp; [there was touching..]&nbsp; Anyhow, Ronald got me to talk to him about how depressed I have been lately (who knew he even had a clue?) and it was really good to talk to him about it.&nbsp; He wasn't mad or upset and he didn't brush it off like I'm a crazy person or anything.&nbsp; I generally think he just cares about my well-being.&nbsp; And that made me happy.&nbsp; So, after all that talking, we watched a little tv and some videos like Charlie and Candy Mountain!&nbsp; It is so funny.&nbsp; Anyway, we fell asleep kinda late.&nbsp; Woke up at like 10.&nbsp; Good morning!&nbsp; =]&nbsp; And the snow was starting to melt, but it was still SO pretty!&nbsp; The sun was out and I was happy!&nbsp; We went to lunch after check-out at AppleBee's.&nbsp; It was fun!&nbsp; We went to Wal-Mart afterwards.. looked for the Five.Bullet.Main CD, but didn't find it.&nbsp; [they don't have a music store in lebanon, ha] So, Ronald was all, come to Memphis, come to Memphis.&nbsp; The weather was supposedly bad in JC and it was all sun west.&nbsp; One more night.&nbsp; One more.&nbsp; So.. I drove to Memphis!!&nbsp; I followed Ronald back.&nbsp; He's such a sweetheart &lt;3&nbsp; And I surprised my parents.&nbsp; Sunday was my dad's birthday, so it was extra special!&nbsp; And we hung out for a bit, got some dinner [at Huey's nonetheless] and walked over to Bestbuy (hand in hand) and found that CD!&nbsp; And we went back to Ron's and watched Happy Feet.&nbsp; The ending was cut off, but oh well.&nbsp; In between, I watched some of Ronald's porn!&nbsp; Ew!&nbsp; I'm sorry but I did <strong>not</strong> find that attractive.&nbsp; So, we put back in Happy Feet, lol.&nbsp; Well... right after we practiced a movie of our own ;)&nbsp; Aw, he's so awesome!!&nbsp; So, I slept SO good in Ron's bed in his arms back at home where my heart feels whole.&nbsp; We woke up at like 6ish.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; He had to work, blah.&nbsp; [[fill in with a Good Morning here]] and then we got all ready to leave.&nbsp; I walked him down to his car and said goodbye.&nbsp; I didn't let a tear fall because I had such a wonderful time with him.&nbsp; He saved me.<br /><br />So, I drove back to JC on Monday.&nbsp; It seems crazy, but oh well.&nbsp; Time well spent.&nbsp; I was in stop and go traffic for an hour outside of knoxville and had to get off the highway and find my way around to get back to 40 east.&nbsp; So, it took me about nine hours to get back to JC, but oh well.&nbsp; It was a beautiful day to drive.&nbsp; The highway felt good.&nbsp; Refreshing.&nbsp; Sometimes you just gotta drive, I guess.<br /><br />And... only 10 days until Spring Break!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; Ronald and me are both OFF work.&nbsp; Yesa!!<br /><br />-----<br /><br />So, I'm at work [of course] and I'm still so giddy from this weekend.&nbsp; I swear the sky is bluer today than it has been in weeks.&nbsp; I will swear by it.&nbsp; Classes are going wonderfully!&nbsp; I got an A on my Brit Lit II test.&nbsp; I got an A on my Comp/Writ/Lit paper.&nbsp; I've gotten nothing but full credit in my SOAA and Orientation classes online.&nbsp; Spanish test tomorrow and American Lit test on Tuesday.&nbsp; Me and some girls [who I think are pretty great!] are going to study for it tomorrow after my class.&nbsp; It's nice to have some girls to talk to in all my classes!&nbsp; So, school... I'll give an A+ this semester so far.<br /><br />I need a book, I think..."

"event","I know I've been updating a lot more than usual, but oh well.&nbsp; Sometimes life gets rough and I need to write it all out.

Ronald and I made up (of course).&nbsp; I love that guy.&nbsp; I really, really do.&nbsp; He's my whole world.&nbsp; My everything.&nbsp; I can't imagine my life without him and it gets harder and harder every single day to be away from him.&nbsp; It's not easy.&nbsp; No one said it would be, but I still try.&nbsp; I love him.&nbsp; I love him so much.&nbsp; I would fall apart if he left me and I know that.&nbsp; My world would crumble.&nbsp; It's pretty bad that my happiness does infact depend on him in many ways... but you know what?&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I love him.&nbsp; We'll see each other on Saturday.&nbsp; Thank Goodness.&nbsp; I can hardly wait!!

I read allllll weekend.&nbsp; Three books, actually.&nbsp; I'm such a dork.&nbsp; Blah.

Talked to Lamanda and Heather until like 3am... having some great girls to live with is lucky for me.

I don't know how I feel right now.&nbsp; I think I'm seriously depressed now.&nbsp; I cut tonight.&nbsp; I know I'm an idiot, but it felt nice.&nbsp; Familiar.&nbsp; It's good when you can see wounds heal.&nbsp; None of mine ever seem to (on the inside).&nbsp; I think I'm falling even faster now.. I just get so sad that I can't cry now.&nbsp; I can't even manage the tears.&nbsp; There's something wrong with me but I can't seem to tell anyone.&nbsp; I don't know what's wrong and I'm scared.&nbsp; Scared because I don't want to be here anymore.&nbsp; So much so that I think I could do something really stupid one night.&nbsp; And.. I don't really care.&nbsp; The sane part of me knows that I will be okay.&nbsp; But the other part of me says, screw it.&nbsp; Sometimes I just don't listen...&nbsp; I hope seeing Ronald this weekend will bring me back to a level of happiness.&nbsp; I just feel like letting him go when we have to leave will just leave me heartbroken again and I don't know how I'll handle that.&nbsp; I can't think of that.&nbsp; Not now.

I want to see my baby and be happy for 24 hours.&nbsp; I love him so much.&nbsp; So, so much.

My whole world, love of my life. 
Everything to me,
He's my baby!"

"event","I didn't mess this up, I swear.

And if you knew how much
all i wanted in this life was to
just runaway
and have someone
follow me,
you would know why
this place means to me
what it does...

if you've ever watched the sunset
against a mountaintop
after a february snowfall
then you know how i feel.
red scrapes across the horizon
i feel like i'm just a small dot
in the middle of the big
universe
and i could be carried away
with the blue sky
at any minute
but i'm not scared.
of the wind.
of the sky.
i'm not scared to stand
and watch
this life go by.

'cause i've run too far
gave too much
wanted so badly
these things
that i have fallen
so hard,
been broken&nbsp;
so often
been tied down for
too long
that i can't stand the thought
of giving it up.

so i stare out this window,
a view from the top
dream about other things
to try to just let go
of all the things
i can't change
anymore.

if you look at the sky now,
it's completely dark.
no trace of blue
or red
and you can't find
a star in the sky
unless you look past the streetlight
and squint with
one eye,
but i notice
everytime
you say goodnight
that way
so i just cry
and wish myself
that star
to make my night
complete,
i'm not alone,
i'm not alone.

have you ever run away
and caught your breath
at the stoplight
waiting for the light to turn green
and it felt like
eternity?

my life has turned green,
it's now or never
and i can't stop running
in whatever direction&nbsp;
i plan on going
even if i'm wrong
i'll get somewhere
someday,
call it my own
and eventually
run back home,
i'll come back home
if you'll just wait for me.

i've waited for my eternity,
it's my chance to see
what's out there for me,
to cross the lines
and break the barriers
and walk along
sidewalks
that lead up to mountain tops
and i want to touch the sky
when it turns red and
follow the clouds
until i find one star,
one way
to answer all teh questions
i have about myself.
then i'll be complete,
find myself and
i'll be whole.

let me climb my mountain
let me touch the sky.
you can watch from where you are,
but my star will be
waiting at the top.

are you ready to run?"

I always thought that it would fade away in college, but apparently not.&nbsp; What makes me look smart?&nbsp; lol, glasses?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I kind of like it, though.&nbsp; That makes me feel kinda dorky, but I don't care.&nbsp; I'm a dork and I'll take it.&nbsp; That's right, I like to read and I did my paper and I read because I wanted to.. not because she assigned it.&nbsp; I answer questions because I'm interested, so there.&nbsp; I love English, so hate me.&nbsp; Blah, I will be an awesome teacher to your children.&nbsp; And then, they will love literature, too.&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; Your kids will be geeks, too.&nbsp; So just sit in the back and sleep...<br /><br />Well, that was kinda random.<br /><br />I am almost paid off for my Capital One credit card.&nbsp; Thank goodness!!&nbsp; I owed them like $400.&nbsp; It doesn't sound like a lot, but my interest was outrageous.&nbsp; I am going to go to First Tennessee to see if I can get a credit card with them instead.&nbsp; That way, I can use it and not be scared!<br /><br />This growing up stuff, well, I don't know if I'm so great at it.&nbsp; Nights I just want to scream and cry on my bed.&nbsp; Then, I get up and go to work because I know I have to.&nbsp; I'm a resposible girl.&nbsp; I know that no matter whatever is given to me, I will never <u>not</u> do something.&nbsp; I always turn stuff in.&nbsp; I always try.&nbsp; I might fail miserably, but atleast I try, you know?&nbsp; I can't really even relax because I've got all this on me.&nbsp; I'm still not really used to coming home to myself.&nbsp; I was always used to my mom or dad asking how my day was or something.&nbsp; But no one does that to me... I always ask the girls how their days were, though.&nbsp; I guess it's my 'mom instinct,' as Ronald calls it.&nbsp; I am like their mom.&nbsp; But, anyway.&nbsp; I don't know... it's crazy.&nbsp; I just hope I can make it.&nbsp; Lately I have been feeling like I want to quit everything, drop out of school, work at some fast food joint forty hours a week, come home to a good book and call it a life.&nbsp; But I know that's not who I am.&nbsp; I need to be challenged.&nbsp; And I will never be able to give up.&nbsp; I can't.&nbsp; I don't think it's in my blood.&nbsp; Blah, stupid.<br /><br />I guess I'll call my mom tomorrow.&nbsp; Tell her about snow and papers... as long as I'm up to it.&nbsp; Hm.&nbsp; I think I'll have ice cream when I get home.&nbsp; Yea, maybe.<br /><br />Forty-five mintues til I gotta close up.&nbsp; I'd better be going.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />if i jumped off the roof<br />of the tallest building<br />in the whole world,<br />would you follow me<br />to the farthest country.<br />care enough about me<br />to chase me across the atlantic<br />and climb the walls like<br />mountain tops<br />to save me from myself,<br />would you yell from the background<br />and watch me run away,<br />watch me break down<br />in the middle of highway 81<br />sourrounded by tall trees,<br />would you search for me<br />or stand by and let me go,<br />would you hold my hand<br />as i dropped off the edge of the globe,<br />dry my tears when i can't find<br />where i'm going<br />and open the map to a place<br />where i could go<br />to get all this out of my system<br />or would you just let me go<br />all alone<br />into the world,<br />would you just stand in the distance<br />as i crumble beneath all these burdens.<br />stand beside me,<br />fall with me<br />runaway<br />and disappear<br />just so i could have<br />some company..<br /><br />how much do you love me?"

i just can't seem to say
goodnight.

i walk through that door
it's so dark outside
i can't even see

it's spitting snow

i miss you so much

my whole world into it,
so i could take off
and run away into
the rest of our lives
in just one night,
one drive.

the coffee is brewing.
i love how it fills the room
and i drink mine black
[plain and simple]

on a winter's eve.
i wish you were here tonight,
i'd fix your coffee just as you like
[sweet and strong]
just the way you feel against me
with hearts beating

the clock ticks away.
sooner than later 
we'll be together
and i'll stay wrapped up
in all the ways i dream
about how calendar days
fly off the page and
we'll be snuggled under covers
in the moonlight,
when you can hear the wind pick up
and see the snowflakes fall,
we'll be warm and in love
[the way our hearts deserve].

...I think that's true.

::sigh:: I feel just like blah today.  So, there.

AHH.

[i just need a break.]

It's just been barely six days.  Six days since you left my apartment and drove onto that stupid, stupid highway.  I wish you would have stayed.  I wish that time didn't creep around so fast and steal everything I hold so dear.  I hate time.  I hate clocks and highways, billboard signs and the way the moon lights the empty parking lot tonight.

Honestly, I just want you here.  There.  I don't care if that's unreasonable or impossible.  That is what I want.  That is what my heart craves.  I can just CRY my eyes out thinking that what I have in you is over five hundred miles away and that I have NO idea when I'll be whole again.  I want you on MY couch, in MY room waiting RIGHT HERE when I come home.  I want it to be that way and I'm sure I won't be fully satisfied until that happens.  Plain and simple.  Call me selfish or whatever, but my heart can't take much more of this distance.  It's breaking me down, love.  I'm broken.

I love you.  I love how you smile when I look at you.  The way your eyes shine when you're happy and the cute way we can argue about anything when we're together and FIX it.  I love the way my hand falls so perfectly into yours.  The way my hair is always tangled in your face before we fall asleep.  I love the way waking up to makes me whole day sparkle, and curling up next to at night completes me.  I love how you hold me so close when we're together.  I love the way your curls look in the morning and I just love you to pieces.  I love being with you.  I just don't feel like I can be exactly who I am without you near me.  I feel like I'm missing apart of me.  I don't want anything but for you to be here.

There are so many things I know that can keep you away from me, but I just want you to know that I'm not so sure how many more nights I can make it alone.  I just can't do it with you so far from me for much longer.  

I can't."

School has started.&nbsp; Busy, busy.&nbsp; I've been reading a lot.&nbsp; Spanish is really hard right now.&nbsp; I feel behind...like I missed out on something.&nbsp; I don't know whether I'll drop the clase or not.&nbsp; I'll know by the end of the week.&nbsp; So, yeah.&nbsp; So far, though, all classes are going well.&nbsp; It's all good.&nbsp; Elle and Lamanda have been doing art stuff!&nbsp; How cute!!

I miss home!&nbsp; Soooo much.&nbsp; :(

I'm in love with this song, I loved her first.&nbsp; It made me cry the first time I heard it.&nbsp; Makes me think of my daddy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

APS is going good.&nbsp; Back to work with Bobbie.&nbsp; It's all good!&nbsp; New workers, professors, everyone!

I really enjoy my world lit class.&nbsp; I like reading the stuff from the book.&nbsp; Very interesting.

Derek, Amanda, and Jacob are all living with mom and dad temporarily.&nbsp; Yes, yes.&nbsp; Jacob is just a talker!&nbsp; He's so cute.&nbsp; I wanna see him.&nbsp; ::pouts::

Christmas in 103 days!!&nbsp; Yay!!

I'm sleepy.&nbsp; 24/7.... ha.

I think Elle and Carter are broken up.&nbsp; They had this big thing tonight and she just cried.&nbsp; I feel so bad for her... I gave her big hugs!!&nbsp; Stupid boy.

Nothing extremely exciting happening, I guess.&nbsp; Just same day to day routine.&nbsp; Still working at the motel.&nbsp; Like 32 hours a week.&nbsp; I study a lot there.&nbsp; It's really wonderful!&nbsp; I love it there.

"event","Yay for this weekend and <strong>Lebanon</strong>!!&nbsp; I am uber-super excited to see Ron!!&nbsp; =)<br />Can you believe that it's been one year since his lips touched mine for <em>the first time</em>.&nbsp; Oh my, how exciting!&nbsp; It has gone so fast, but it has been just amazing.&nbsp; We are gonna celebrate in Lebanon this weekend!&nbsp; Yay for romance and other things that make a girl blush.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; I just love him so much.<br /><br />So, just TWO days.&nbsp; I work nights the next two nights, so it will be okay.&nbsp; Hopefully not too much to do.&nbsp; We cleaned carpets today, but it was WAY, way too hot for that stuff.&nbsp; It's burnin' up out here--record heat!&nbsp; I think I brough Memphis' weather with me.&nbsp; Crazy.&nbsp; But it's like 102 in Memphis... so I still feel lucky at 90.<br /><br />I think I still have DialAmerica in me, I talk about the weather often!&nbsp; heh.<br /><br />I tried callin' Ryan.&nbsp; I miss him.&nbsp; I haven't talked to him much since he got his new most-wonderful girlfriend a while back.&nbsp; It was his bday on Sunday, but I didn't get him... just his answering machine and a quick call later sayin' thanks.&nbsp; But atleast I got to hear from him.&nbsp; I know his alive and breathing.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I heart Ryan.&nbsp; I miss 'em.<br /><br />I wish I had a kitty.<br /><br />OH, Dallas lives here!!&nbsp; Gosh, that is TOO funny.&nbsp; I'm getting back Ellie's shuffle.&nbsp; HA, can't run from ME!!&nbsp; lol, I think it was fate.<br /><br />Hm. . .<br /><br />I'm thinking about going to see a doctor about these headaches.&nbsp; I think the stress from them are causing these mouth sores and THEY hurt more than headaches almost.&nbsp; So, I'm lookin', I guess, for a doctor to see.<br /><br />I talked to mom and dad earlier today.&nbsp; They are doin' well.&nbsp; They are starting to work on their room with the bathroom.&nbsp; Back to work for them!&nbsp; Can't wait to see what the downstairs looks like finally finished.&nbsp; I bet it's just beautiful!&nbsp; I'm sure.&nbsp; It was so nice to have them here in the city.&nbsp; I could get used to that.&nbsp; But.... I guess not.<br /><br />So, there ya go.<br /><br />oh yeah,<br />TWO DAYS!!!<br /><br />:)&nbsp; I'm in love."

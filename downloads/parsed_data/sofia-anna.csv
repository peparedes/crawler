"event","my days overseas were absolutely mind blowing..
and pretty much 
all i know for certain is that i miss my brother and sister more than anything.

i gave him a star and he gave me the song that makes me cry above everything else.. 
and now we're the same and laugh with happy tears 
and whisper secrets and i couldn't ask for more.

on the twentieth 
we celebrated like kings and queens beneath the shade of the grandmother oak in the flats and fell in love with the park all over again.

i am old.

on the first, colleen gave me a beautiful hat to wear when i shall one day travel south for the derby and drink mint julips under the kentucky sun. 
the most thoughtful present ever.

besides the fact that my right eye was poisoned by toxic liquid shortly before arrival, 
prom was beautiful. 
late-night chez hagan will go down in history
as out of hand and glorious and everything it was supposed to be.

perfection.

and we danced and sang and realized the worth of eachother beneath the skies of youngstown's north side
and fell asleep to birds chirping and suns rising
and i'm endlessly going to miss my people when i'm gone.


..pittsburgh. =)


and for the first time in a long time
reality is falling into place

and we can almost taste the rays of endless days and olive skin and higher tolerance
of all things bright and beautiful.

today we spent our sacred half hour by the shrine with taco bell, grass stained knees, and assurance that we're doing what we're supposed to do.

and something magical happened in the green and orange room that i call home.. and it all makes me believe again that we are as sweet as someone thought
and oh, yes

we will go out with a bang.


and i can't believe it's almost gone.



..love. =)"

inside my twelve day turtle shell i have enclosed:
1) some brand spankin new hippie skirts from tar(jay)
2) crime and punishment.. yumm.
3) a 100% genuine rock from the youngstown earth.. because i just can't bare to leave the yo behind.


and 365 days is an instant in real time. 
cushioned with single moments that rival infinity and steal the bigger part of the blanket in the middle of the night.
and don't forget to rock out slightly too hard, mes amis, because then you can't say you never did.


ohh, this boy..

i need warm. everything. 

mornings, afternoons, and evenings too.

i need to write maggie and daniel a letter.




play needs to come together.



i sort of need ursuline to stop.


*last night i had a dream that the band was on a field trip to the ursuline motherhouse with all the nuns and nick and i decided to break policy and jump in the swimming pool while everyone else was at the continental breakfast. all the parents were trying really hard to figure out who did it but they never suspected nick and i who were all wet and wearing swimming trunks. the only person who knew the truth was my deceased kindergarten teacher: sister gabriel. she chased me out into the field behind mark's old neighborhood at which point i was transformed into an incarnation of dorothy gale with long curly red hair. we were running at toute vitesse through the grass and sister kept screaming at me: ""i'm telling you to stop! stop!"" but i kept screaming back ""but you always taught me to fly!"" then i jumped into the sky above canfield and left her in my dust.

weird.
but i'm pretty sure it's because colleen and i watched pocahontas before we went to bed last night.
we kept making jokes about chief powahatan and how he in reality graduated from ursuline high school in 1970 with john v.

take what you need, you think will last
but whatever you wish to keep
you better grab it fast
yonder stands your orphan with his gun
crying like a fire in the sun
look out baby, the saints are coming thru
and it's all over now, baby blue

the highway is for gamblers
better use your sense

oh, 2006.
and like always, that final week was epic and immaculate and monumental and beautiful and makes me love youngstown more than anything.
and i don't think there will ever be a more volatile or turbulent year in my life.
and when we drove past it.. there were candles in the windows and furniture in all the wrong places and helplessness. 
but i think everything is ready to begin again, and all the pieces are falling back together. 

my stars are realigning, and it's time to discover them all over again.




..leave your stepping stones behind,
there's something that calls for you
forget the dead you've left that will not follow you
your lover who had just walked thru the door
has taken all his blankets from the floor
the carpet, too, is foldin over you
and it's all over now, baby blue
well, strike another match
go start anew

there's something about dangerous circumstances that makes me love my family beyond words.



my mom lit her lady of guadalupe votive candle and sat in front of the tv yelling out whenever don gave another warning like: ""time to get down in your bathtubs, folks.""
colleen camped out in the basement.
a fort complete with blankets, flashlight, drink boxes, and enough peanut butter sandwiches to last the three of us the whole night.



john v. was in his glory
and assured me he was positive he could probably take the tornado head-on.
so me and him spent most of the ordeal on the front porch looking for funnel clouds and planning elaborate escape routes in case of any actual danger.


we were all giddy children, excited for some real action.
it was love.



so.. thunderstorms = summer, no?
eight days. 
i need skirts and no shoes
and nights under the stars
when nick won't put down his guitar
and we glycerine and wonderwall and creep
and lay on blankets that smell like bonfire
and infinite grass stains on my knees.

The woman is perfected.
Her dead

Body wears the smile of accomplishment,
The illusion of a Greek necessity

Flows in the scrolls of her toga,
Her bare

Feet seem to be saying:
We have come so far, it is over.

Each dead child coiled, a white serpent,
One at each little

Pitcher of milk, now empty.
She has folded

Them back into her body as petals 
Of a rose close when the garden

Stiffens and odors bleed
From the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.

The moon has nothing to be sad about,
Staring from her hood of bone.

She is used to this sort of thing.
Her blacks crackle and drag.

my family went to eat at Bucca diBeppo. on the way, daniel's car started billowing out smoke so we pulled over. the next 45 minutes were just way too surreal and it was really fun. plus i ate a lot of food.

and on the way home last nite me and my mom listened to this amazing cd that maggie had burned.. and it was pretty much a life-changing experience.
rent. a lot. 
only twenty-ish days.



i can't wait for thanksgiving. and parades. and cousins. and food. and snow.


yesss..

"event","nick was a kissing booth.

jimmy was hurricane katrina.. complete with tiny lego people and a spraying water bottle.


after school.. cait/jimmy/nick/i ventured into oak hill cemetery.. where we saw an actual grave being dug. caitlin took sweet pictures of all the ridiculous gravestones of youngstown's old millionaire families. 

then we saw four stray dogs running toward us. so we left.

it was sufficiently creepy and we hope to return once it snows to get better pics. i especially heart how all the roads are brick. it makes me want to be a wick or arms or butler heiress and drive my carriage through the cemetery.



time for mischief making."

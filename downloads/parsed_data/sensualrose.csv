"event","I just had a whole new update typed and the fucker said that I had used the wrong password and so I went through that bullshit and now I'm pissed 'cause I hate to type. Anyway Eliz needs to take some new pics. of me to put on here, 'cause I shaved most of my head and I don't look this way anymore. Its not the first time I've shaved it, but my family thinks I'm goofy, while my girlfriend and other friends say that I look good. The Cringe CD release party was kick ass, got some more autographs and hugs and such."

But you weren't honest
Now get in the ground
You choked off the surest of favors
But if you really loved me
You would have endured my reign

Well if you're just, as I presumed
A whore in sheep's clothing
Fucking up all i do

And if so here we stop
Then never again will you see
This in your life

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here lay to rest is a love ever long
With truth on the shores of confession
You seem to take premise to all of these souls

You stormed off to scar the armada
Like Jesus played letter
I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me

With love and devotion I'll die as you sleep
But you could just rat me out
To never mis-warn her happy will I become
Be true that this is no option
So rinse it, condemn you demon raiding in love

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here lay to rest is a love ever long
With truth on the shores of confession
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

One last kiss for you
One more wish till you
Please make up your mind girl
I'd do anything for you
One last kiss for you
One more wish till you
Please make up your mind girl
Before I hope you die"

Friend : A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.
                        OR
       : One who supports another

Disecting this word and definition are the cause of tonights update *or rather this mornings*

Friend (My defintion) Someone you see on a regular basis whom you can confide into your most trusted secrets and truths, while being aware that this trust/devotion shall never be faultered.

Disection: If you stop talking to your friend, stop confiding in them, stop doing what friends do, you're no longer a friend, merely a colleague or aquaintance.

Enjoy your ""friends"" while they last, and pray that you find somemore for they shall fade from your life, just as your childhood and adolescence will too.

You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know how your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know"

"event","Well well, looks like Circuit City is finally giving in to my demands. I was transferred to the Technology department when I came back from being at National Jamboree. It was huge news to hear from my favorite manager that i'd be in his area from now on. His name is Charles btw, so if you hear me refer to my manager, just know he's Charles, or likewise if I refer to Charles, he's my manager :-). So now that bitch Vivian is no longer over me, mwahahahaha. Anyways, with this new move comes a plus and a down, i'm going to have to work alot more, for instance I went from working about 20-30 hours every 2 weeks, to working 31 hours in 3 straight days, starting tomorrow. The plus is that I go from earning $8/hr to $9.25/hr. Leaving room for a raise sometime soon that makes my life alot better :-). I'll be able to take my girlfriend to wherever she so desires from now on :-P. And actually be able to afford gas. You'd be amazed just how much money that results in. Well i'm kind of done for now."

"event","Okay,

So it has been a while since i've updated but since everything seems to finally be getting back to normal I thought i'd begin to update again. For those of you who read this I went to the National Boy Scout Jamboree 2005 at Fort AP Hill, Virginia, for about 15 days, 3 of which were spent traveling to it and spending one day at the renound Busch Gardens. There we rode roller coasters and had a blast, what else would you do there? After that we went on to the Jamboree, where we got offered to come in a day early, to avoid 30,000 scouts and adult leaders all coming in at the same time. Well we came in and got out camp set up pretty quick, alot faster than the other 3 troops of boys and adult leaders from our area. Some of you may have had another friend who went, if so I don't know. Anyways, while we were there I got to meet alot of guys from around the nation, which afterall is what you're supposed to do at these things, and I got to do alot of the things that you'd expect Boy Scouts to do. Shoot guns, climb, tie knots, make stuff from wood and things, throw tomahawks and knives, shoot black powder rifles, things of that nature. I got to fish, which was awesome because when I caught my fish I got to eat it :-)...frankly the normal food was a little lacking so yeah, that was an added bonus. I did this thing called patch trading, which as it does sound boring and dorkish, it really is, but it has a certain excitement to it I guess you could say, seeing if you could get the most rare of some patch, which varies through each Jamboree. I was actually lucky enough to have gone through 2 as a youth scout. Once in 2001 and again this summer 2005. Both were amazing and I just have to say that I had a great time at both. For those of you not in scouts you may not care and thats understandable, but I just thought you ought to know we do more than just sit around fires and tie knots, while we do do those things, we do them for purposes. The closing show there was awesome because President Bush was there, and we got to see snipers, marines, rangers...basically all of the armed forces to certain degress. We even got to mingle with some of the secret service agents. I must say that in 2010, because they rescheduled the event to co-inside with the 100th anniversary of Boy Scouting in America, that it will be even bigger and better. You guys should definetly stop buy to at least see what its all about. Trust me, you wont' be dissappointed.

Thanks for listening,
Ryan

P.S.
I didn't forget you Melisa, I love you :-P"

I've come to question myself as a boyfriend, am I a good boyfriend, do I treat my girlfriend with the respect and attention she deserves? She's a great girl and I hate to not be there for her, i've been this ghost in her life that shows up only when its convienent. Not when I need to be, i'm tired of living like this, I love her and I hope that she knows it, I just want everyone else to know it...

Don't give a fuck about this
My life or any other
Just go away and let me hang
Impossible to forgive, forget it, murderer
I'm in control

Living a lie
Make you pay at all cost for this
Love sick
Bullshit
Bring it

Decisions making themselves
I don't need you
Thorns in my side
So I die

No one
No one could ever understand
My life's exhausted
No one
No one could ever understand
This life IMN

Determined
To bring you all down with me
Break you
Beat down
No more fucking empathy
From me, for you
Fed up i've had enough
Duality
My war
Existence
Instigated controversy
Lay down
Sell out
So wrong

Drag the blade and go away
I stand, cold cruel and lost
Take me I'm ready

No one

So hard

Fight hard
Break bones break

This life IMN

Your pressure
My time
Eroding
My life
Fight for your honesty
Fight for integrity

All work and no play
All work and no play
All work and no play waiting
All work and no play
All work and no play left me
Sick!

I want to eat a bullet
Carve myself
Beat my face
Catotonic
Dig my brain
No pain! suffocate!
Stomach aches
Don't give a fuck
I'm out, I'm done
Fuck this shit
You've dug the hole
I'm lying in

"event","Well this is a post from today and yesterday, because I was way to strung out yesterday.

I went to my moms house after riding and basically passed out, the next morning I went to see Melisa, and she was just a beautiful as can be. I picked her up we went to many places and had lots of fun ;-). After which we went to Northcross, and played DDR, met Rich there, and Leia and her guy Josh came bye and she introduced him to me and me to him, and melisa to leia and leia to melisa, so on and so forth, I went back with my friend and lover O_O to Northcross. We chilled there until I had to take Melisa home, took her home, left and came back to my house, ate dinner, went back out to Northcross and almost got in trouble for being late, cause I lost track of time. Went to bed got up and went to Mom's house, changed and went to work. Worked from 1-10.30ish and then made a quick stop by Northcross again to say hi to everyone, no one was there X_X. Only Randy and Dave and Alexis. So I left came home, talked to Melisa, chatted for a while and am writting this here now :-P, oh and happy day light savings time."

Can someone answer this question for me, can someone take away the temptation that i'm faced with, can someone please make life simple for me. Life it too complex, and people wonder why so many kids commit suicide, its because they just don't understand, its because they've lost all hope of ever having a good day, its gone and they're tired of living like that.

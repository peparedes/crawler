marking the first time i laid eyes on you.
i lost all train of thought as i entered the room.
i saw what looked like really good food,
then i saw you and so did you.
i wanna wake up naked next to you,
kissing the curve in your clavicle.
kissing your clavicle.
i've been on top of the world since about 1 week ago,
marking a time when i was drunk enough to talk to you.
i lost all train of thought as your eyes met mine.
told you i thought you were gorgeous.
you gave me your phone number,
i gave you mine.
before you left i said that you can bet i'll be bothering you soon.
 you said, ""no bother, please do.""
 i've called you twice.
 it's been a hellish fight to not think about you all the time.
sitting around waiting for your call.
i wanna wake up naked next to you,
kissing the curve in your clavicle.

So anyway, I'm definitly gonna make this friends only. I promise that it's nothing against you who read my lj without being on my friends list; it's only a way of knowing who is. I fear that someone is reading it that I should really know about since I talk about them all the time. As a matter of fact, after this entry I'll be able to be oh-so-specific as to who he is. So, anyway.........

It could be that I'm done working at McDonalds and I know that I never have to go back there again. Whatever it may be, I feel so beautiful today (bop bop bop bop bop ba da bop). I know this is all gonna sound so conceited, but I looked in the mirror this morning, and I could not figure out why he doesn't wanna be with me. I mean, come on, there's really nothing about me that's worth writing me off. And here's a great question: WHO THE HELL DOES HE THINK IS GONNA PUT UP WITH HIS SHIT! No offense to the guy, but, honestly, he's so retarded sometimes. He's annoying, he can be very judgmental, and, although I think he's the hottest man alive, most of the girls I've ever talked to don't think that he's that much to look at. Yet, I'm crazy about him. I know that I could just fall in love with him at the drop of a hat! He must be gay! LOL

Oh my gosh; I went running this morning. I AM SO EFFING OUT OF SHAPE! It's gonna take like a month to get to any point of being anywhere close to a place that I can breathe. Oh well, it's all for two good causes:
1. I want to be healthy.
2. It bothers me that I paid $80 for Abercrombie jeans, and now they dont' fit anymore.

"event","So, at Quartelife tonight, I had a mini breakdown. So many things just hit me so hard. They showed the video of Andrew Schoenbeck (I think that's how you spell it). Dan was talking about how so many times we just stay in our comfortable little church settings; we never leave our comfort zones!!! It's always about us. But in reality it's not supposed to be like that.

IT'S ALL ABOUT JESUS! It's about what HE wants, what HE needs us to do for HIS cause!  If a ten year old boy with cancer can, not only choose to live for Jesus, but actually follow through, then how much more could I? Even if I do it slowly, a little at a time. Just one life at a time.

This is my passion. He hit on the head the whole reason I want to teach high school. To attempt to assist God in changing the lives of teens in their hardest years! That is what I wanna be about! That is what I'm gonna do with my life! Please tell me that you wanna make the same decision. Maybe not to teach to do it, but to do it with your own talents! Join me in the fight for Jesus, please!

The best thing I heard tonight was: Decrease mw until there is only YOU!

GOD BLESS!

"event","Well, life is really crazy right now. I'm gonna stay with my grandparents for the remainder of the summer in an effort to keep some of the shit from being beat out of me. I think this'll be best for us all. My mother won't have to stress about the lack of tidiness in my room or hurt her hands trying to kill me. I'll avoid the murder attempts, and get to live with people who for some odd reason love me. My grandparents will get to keep a watch on me; this is important to them because they do worry about me sometimes. I'll be in Troy, which is closer to stuff for me. So it should all work out for good.

I'm going to church tonight! I haven't gone in, like, a week and a half, so it should be good. I'm really excited for OU, though. I have fallen madly in love with the place: the freedom, the lack of my mother, etc. I am just counting down the days until August 27.

I hope I get my car back tomorrow. I have to get proof of insurance, and then my mother said she'd turn it over. She damn-well better! If I wasn't a Christian, I'd probably kill her, but, unfortunately, that would make Jesus sad, and I don't wanna do that.

I'm also very excited for this Star Wars 3 1/2 that Jason told me about. I am also condidering trying out for the daughter of Chewy, Jastherain. I already have the sound, I just need some really high platforms, I'm told that my wookie noise is superior to that of any other human being! Hahahahahaha. Okay, I appologize for this paragraph, only Jason and Tessa would have any idea what I'm talking about. Unless, my some miracle, Julie and Christian remembered it from Monday night.

Moving on:
So in conclusion; life is gonna get better as soon as I get my car, and we can all be happy. You may even see me smile if you happen to be at church tonight......

LOVE YOU ALL AND GOD BLESS YOU!"

Thank you to all of my friends who have been nothing but supportive and as helpful as possible, thank you so much for everything, the prayers, love, and encouragement, you have no idea how much this has all meant to me in this time of pain.

a) We're somewhere talking one on one........
b) When we're on the phone, and nobody is around him...........

See a pattern? In case you don't, the pattern is the fact that he treats me like a really good friend when noone is around, but the second one of his/our friends are around, it's like he's got something to prove. Am I that horrible that he actually has to go out of his way to make sure that noone thinks we are friends?!?!?! Arg. What aggravates me even more is that I still like him, and, what's worse, I don't even want to get over him. It's too much work and stress. Plus, part of me keeps hoping that he'll just give in and like me, too. What makes things worse is that I know deep down inside that it's never gonna happen, but I just don't wanna give up hope. He is everything I have ever wanted in a man, and I doubt that there is anyone else like him in the world. Oh, silly boy, when will you learn? Someday you'll realize how good you would have had it. How many other girls are gonna put up with all the shit you do? Who are you gonna find that'll look at how absolutely retarded you can be and still be crazy about you? Good luck with that one!

I've been so excited about everyhting that I haven't had the time to think of how crazy this all is. I don't even know what to do.

It's so crazy to look back, I mean, I was five years old like a week ago. No cares in the world, just chillin in Leonard. I miss those days. I know God has wonderful stuff to come, but right now I just wanna reflect on those things that have happened in my past: the friends I've had, the leassons I've learned, etc.

""Oh, to be young again, for scraped knees are easier to mend than broken hearts........""

Well, I'm gonna go now, but I want you to know that someday, when I'm looking back on this period of my life, just as I'm looking back now, you will be the ones that I remember fondly. I love you guys.

"event","Oh what a tangled web we weave. So engrossed by our own emotions and problems that we can't even see what's going on around us. There are broken hearts, lives, homes, dreams, and spirits. What do we do for these? Nothing. We go on with our own little lives, making sure that we're getting what we think that we need and ignoring the needs of others. Then we wonder what the cause of the major degradation of society is, when in reality it is, in fact, ourselves. If we all could just show a fraction of the love that Jesus showed in his days on Earth, the world would be a much better place.

When a ""Christian"" family rejects their 19 year old son because he wanted to move out and they didn't want him to, when a group of ""Christians"" fights a group of people just because they believe differently or have different morals instead of just loving them, when someone who's dress isn't up to the likes of a church so they look down on them and don't make them feel welcome, when things like this happen it makes you wonder what's wrong with the world, even Christians. It's no wonder that Christianity is so rejected by society, look at what we've done to ourselves. Jesus hung out with tax collectors and hookers, why can't we hang out with homos and criminals, with those who aren't fortunate enough to afford nice clothes for church. Instead of jumping to judge, why don't we HELP PEOPLE? Why don't we show people what Jesus was all about? Just a thought.......

I love you guys so much, you rock, you help lift my spirits when I'm down, you encourage me towards God, now please say that you believe that we can do that for others outside of ourselves to help tham out too.

There are so many awesome things happening in my life right now, but it's hard to not focus on the fact that the thing I want more than almost anything is so far out of reach. I know I should just be grateful for the many things I want that I do have, but it's so hard.

Why is it that falling for someone is sooo easy, even when you're scared, but getting over them is soooooooooooooooo hard?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

""I'm taking my time
I'm trying to leave the memories of you behind
I'm gonna be fine
As soon as I get your picture right out of my mind

Chorus:
I wanna feel the way you make me feel when I'm with you
I wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to
But everytime I call
You don't have time
I guess I'll never get to call you mine

You're nothing at all
I know there's a million reasons why I shouldn't call
With nothing to say
Could easily make this conversation last all day

(Chorus)

Another lesson I did not get to learn
You're my obsession
I've got nowhere to go

(Chorus)""

Guess who that song reminds me of............

Anyway..........

"event","What is wrong with the men in today's society?!?! Don't they see that this obsession with lust and porn and things of the flesh is ruining them? Don't they see that htey are impairing their ability to have a meaningful realtionship? I don't know if any of you knew this, but I've dated two guys that were obsessed with it. You know what happened? The first one broke up with me for not having sex with him and being kinky like the girls in his movies. The second one cheated on me with one of my best friends because I wouldn't do it with him, but she would.

I know first hand how heart breaking this can be. Furthermore, guys who look at a lot of porn have higher expectations of their girlfriends, wives, and other women in general. Think of how it would be if, by some miracle, a guy who watched a lot of porn went along with his fiance's no sex until marriage policy; then they got married and had sex. But it wasn't like the pornos he loved so much to watch. So he cheated on her until he found the girl that was like what he was looking for. But he never found her. One of his lovers ends up getting pregnant...oops! Now he is faced with how to tell her that he's married and tell his wife that he's father, but she's not a mother. You think I'm exaggerating? This has happened.

Today's society makes these things seem like ""no big deal"" and something that ""everyone's doing"", but in reality it IS a big deal and NOT everyone is doing it. In fact it's such a big deal that I'll never again date anyone who does do it. We should not just sit there and take this, girls. It's time to stand up for ourselves! Just praying and encouraging all of the men in our lives; friends, boyfriends, whoever; and even some girls we know that do it will be a big help. It will never be completely gone, but with a little time and prayer, we can help make a difference. Please, don't ever make the mistake I made of thinking that it's no big deal!

In case you can't tell by the list of activities, you may want to bring a bathing suit.
The only thing that I ask is that you tell me if you are going to come. This is simply because I assume you would like to eat, and if I run out food those who didn't mention coming will not get food. Even if you call me the morning of, that's fine. So call or comment to let me know if you are gonna come! Hope to see you all there.

I have one more exam left: Bible. This actually sucks, because we were supposed to memorize a Psalm, but I don't remember which one. I remember it being one that I already knew, but that doesn't tell me which one is was.  I'll have to call someone with a brain. Hahahahaha.

I decided that it wasn't necesary to go to school today. (Yay) All I have left to so is to take a few exams and show up at graduation. Oh, I also need to make that tape for the ceremony.  I went to OU today to figger out a few things. It turns out that giving them money fixes everything.

It doesn't seem right that a mere human could have such an effect on me.  I have yet to figger out why he does.  I mean, for Pete's sake, it would make a little bit of sense if we were, maybe, dating or if he were interested, but being that that is most definitely not the case, I'm thinking it's about time to move on.  Oh, and could I be more blatently obvious? Probably not, but I think if he knew, I'd never hear from him at all.  I don't know, but this is why I think that girls are stupid: we sit there and waste all of our energy thinking about that one guy, whether he's a boyfriend or a crush.  Isn't there a much better way to spend our time.

I was just thinking: wouldn't it be wierd if only one of your armpits smelled really good (like deodorent) and the other one smelled completely rank? Just some contemplations of a dumb blonde.

Okay, I realize that this is an uber-long entry, but I keep wanting to add things.  I'm sitting here watching FRIENDS, and as I watch them, I notice that they are all most happy when they are with somebody.  So I'm thinking to myself, ""Is that a subliminal message, or is there really some truth in the fact that people are happier when they are loved?""  I think that it's very possible that the media puts things like this into our heads to get us to believe that you need someone to be happy. I mean I'm sure it would be great to be loved by someone besides Jesus, but I think that I'm pretty happy: aren't I? On second thought, I do want to be loved by someone, but not just anyone.

I guess I have nothing else to talk about. Go to the party or else!  TTYL

My mom yelled at me and said some stuff that she didn't really mean, but my reaction to it was so stupid it needs to be told about.  I never saw what was really going on with her. I don't really talk to her much at all, which is no good on my part.  I didn't see the whole picture. I've been so selfish in this: just doing whatever I felt and not even taking into consideration her thoughts and feelings.  I felt so bad when I realized it.  We had a long talk, and now everything is cool again.  I guess it will be forever, now that I'm moving out, and we won't have anything to fight over.  I have to fix this all.

I finally got all the things done at OU that need to be finished before orientation, I only need to turn in one more thing so I can live there.  I'm so excited and so scared all at the same time.  I mean, I'm gonna be living on campus....yay.  Also though, I could end up with an a-hole roommate, or I might not be able to keep up academically. You know what though?  I'm just not gonna worry about it.  It's about time that I hand this over to God and just trust that He will take care of me; He will provide.

"event","Well, everything I have been working for the past thirteen years for is gonna come down to Friday, June 3, at 7:30 PM.  I'm so excited, I'm so happy, I'm so scared, and I'm so ready for this.  I don't even care if I trip on my face on the way to the stage, as long as I get my diploma. I'm almost completely set for Oakland University now. I can't wait to be a Grizzly.  I wanted to do the internship for Edge, but they only allow time for two classes per semester.  I don't wanna have to go to college for eight years.  I don't know, though, I'm going to look it over a few times and pray about it.  I know that God will lead me in my decision.  It's not so much God that I'm worried about, though, my grandma will have a fit if I'm only gonna take 2 classes a semester, and I don't wanna have to worry about that.

It's so wierd to look back and think about how it seemed the time it was taking to get to this point in my life was so long; now, looking back, it seems odd to think about the fact that I'm eighteen years old, I have a car, jobs, bills, and will soon be at college. The decision has been made: I'm moving in with my grandparents after graduation, and I'm going to live on campus during the academic school year.  I would like to get a job at Cedar Point next summer.  A few girls that I know are doing it, and it seems like so much fun. My friend Nicole said that she may be interested, also.

I don't really know what God is going to do with me. I'm sure He has something for me to accomplish, and I'm trusting that He will show me in His time. Until then, I will do my best and try to make it through.  Well, I'm gonna leave ""y'all"" now. TTYL

Just kidding....not quite finished. I was just reading something, and it made me realize that one of the saddest things ever is for someone you were pretty good friends with to just completely drop and ignore you.  And as much as that hurts, what's even worse is when they make an effort to be friends again, and you almost don't want to talk to them at all, for fear of getting hurt. I will always love my friends, and I will always be willing to restart a friendship, but do you think that there's a point that you have to say, ""enough is enough""?  I mean is being naive and allowing people to lead you on and hurt you just as bad as not forgiving at all if it is ultimately going to cause you to end up in heartache? I don't know. You tell me.

God Bless

PEACE OUT"

"event","It's amazing how everything can go from great to pretty bad to awesome to absolutely rechid all in the course of like a week or two! I don't understand why I'm such an idiot, but I've learned my lessons now.  I know how to handle things now. I'll do better next time. The worst part will be the disappointment in my grandfather's eyes. He really thought I had it together, so did I. Well, at least I got into the college I want to go to, I'm graduating with red ropes, and I'm not gonna have to pay full price for collage (but apparently I'm gonna have to learn how to spell it).

I guess when it all comes down to it, things aren't so bad.  I just wish I had been able to learn my lesson from everyone else's mistakes instead of finding the, like, one thing that they didn't screw up and doing that! Ugh. Oh well, cest la vie, as the French say.

Gotta go now, God Bless.

"event","Well.....so much for anything good ever happening!!!!!  I got a 25 on my ACT's which seemed like good news til everything else blew up in my face! My mom is so evil! I wish she would just leave me alone! I'm sick of all her bull honky!!!  She needs to realize that, yeah, I am an adult, but I'm also still a student and her daughter (note: not slave/housekeeper/chef/bank customer) which means that she should be taking care of me.  Not that I necesarily want her to, but until I can pay her back, she needs to lighten up and realize that just because I'm 18 now, doesn't mean that I'll magically just be able to take care of myself, especially when I still owe her $323. Ugh!

So, I'm not keeping the trailer, I'm not getting an apartment, and I'm not getting along with my mom! So it looks like I either live on campus, even if only for the non-summer semesters and live with my grandparents during the summer, or I move in with Julie. I actually really wanna live on campus, I think it'd be so fun!!!!!  So I guess that'll work out alright. I'm not getting nearly enough hours at the Gap, so I'm gonna go back to McDonald's full time mornings this summer, and work whatever nights that they need me at Gap. 

Almost graduation time!!!!!! Cedar Point is on Monday, senior skip day is on Friday, and Graduation is 8 days after that!!!!!!!   Yay!!! No more high school! ""School's out forever!!!""

If you can guess title and artist of this song, I'll give you a cookie!:

""This single-minded fascination I've got....do you call it love....if you don't then what?
All I know is I don't know what you've done, but this train I'm on ain't about to jump the track that it's on!""


Well, I guess I should go do my chores now! (whoohoo for being grounded!)
PEACE OUT"

"event","Well, I'm almost a graduate, I'm almost an Oakland University student, and I'm almost out of debt. I'm almost completely happy, almost depressed, I almost miss some things, I have almost the biggest crush on someone that I was almost over, I'm almost in love with someone that I almost ruined a friendship with, I almost want my Ray-ray back. My grandma's aunt is almost 102 and now she's almost dead. =( It's almost summer, and I can almost go swimming and sunbathing. Almost, almost, almost.

Isn't almost a funny word. It's holds such a great meaning. It can be good or bad. It can be very close to everything you ever wanted or even closer to everything that you never wanted! Hmmm.....

I got my graduation robe today! Yay! One step closer! I almost (lol) can't wait. I'm sure that I'll live, though.

It's kinda funny, but I can feel God telling me things. Some things are encouragement, some are telling me things that I need to take care of. Even things that I had never thought would be an issue! I guess it's time to finish growing up, aye? I was thinking about how much I'm gonna miss everyone after we all graduate. I know that graduating is something I've been looking forward to my whole life, but I do have some great friends that I'm not gonna get to see as much once I graduate, and while that's sad, I guess that I should just consider it a part of life and move on!

Well, not much more to bore you with. I'll get back with y'all soon! Laterz!!!!!

PEACE OUT!"

JESUS IS MY HOMEBOY! HE'S GOT MY BACK! I THINK IT'S TIME TO RETURN THE FAVOR, DON'T YOU?

I can't wait til graduation! June 3rd 7 o'clock. Everyone I know is invited. If wanna go see proof that I'm not a complete idiot, please come!

I am gonna miss a few things, though. Such as....well.....um.....there must be something I'll miss about high school! Well, I'll figger it out someday; let me know if there's anything you can think of that I may miss!

Oh my goodness! You know that guy that you'd really love to get over, but he's just so amazing that you just can't? Well, I do. I wish that I had never started liking him.  I always do this! What's wrong with me? I think that I should just get hypnotized into never feeling this way about anyone and save myself some pain.

When it comes to love, I just don't have any luck! I want so badly to get married and have five kids and be a stay-at-home/soccer mom. I wanna find that person that is perfect for me. Someone that I can pray and grow in God with, someone that has the same passions and morals that I do.  Someone that's  a good Christian and would be a good husband and father and friend. Wow, no wonder I can't find anyone: talk about wanting someone so far out of my league that I can't even afford tickets to watch the game! (Hey! That was a cute little analogy!)

Ever have one of those days when you feel like taking a huge brush and painting the sky?

Well, I'm not feeling well, so I'm gonna go get some sleep! TTYL

"event","Don't you just love it when people over-dramatize everything, blame what was their own damn fault on you, then tell you that you've lost your mind? It's so much fun! (Not!) I'm sorry but please leave me a comment if you think that I've lost my mind for not wanting to be around someone who pretended to be my best friend, then when hanging out with me was no longer convenient, completely abandoned me. And now is trying to blame everything on me, saying that I've lost my mind, and such. And you wanna talk about retarded: I don't talk to her anymore because now all the little things that I didn't care so much about when we were friends are seeming like a bigger deal, and I don't wanna get hurt again. Yeah, I must be insane, right? All she had to do was appologize for treating me like shit and admit that it was not my whole fault, and I would have appologized for being a bitch lately and we all could have just gone on with our lives, knowing that sometimes friendships drift away and that was all that happened. But, no, that apparently makes too much sense.

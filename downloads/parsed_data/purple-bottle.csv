"event","UGH&nbsp;wow i fail.

the museum just emailed me to say due to the overwhelming response, i'm only an alternate for the sleeping job. basically if anyone cancels they might call me to fill in. I&nbsp;AM&nbsp;MAJORLY&nbsp;BUMMED. though my mom is relieved. 

they really made it seem like i had the job when i was interviewed. i mean do i really fail that much that i can;t sleep ON&nbsp;A&nbsp;JOB??? ok, so perhaps i was a little presumptuous in assuming i had it in the bag, but GRAR.

also i told everyone i was gonna sleep for a living. my friends, my family, my boyfriend's family, my shrink. now i feel silly. like sillier then if i actually had the job. 

i'm insanely grumpy today. 

i give up hope for lent."

"event","this week i made an ass of myself in front of rock stars (again), was annointed &quot;super pope&quot;&nbsp;and unintentionally scared the crap out of my parent's friends' 10 yr old daugher. 

so on wednesday i told will sheff (dude from okkervil river)&nbsp;that i didn't leak his song, but almost did, but ultimately didn't. i swear i sounded severely autistic. also he's growing a beard (don't know how i feel about that).whatever i love him.

on friday i had an awesome time tumbling through brooklyn with bill and his brother and cousins who are all cool peeps. i drank lots of cider and talked a lot about the eternal greatness of spandau ballet. and then swiped a glass in my big bag. and then learned how they do it in new orleans and then we walked blocks around the park and admired trees ripe for climbing though we were detered against it by the cold. this probably makes no sense in written form (as most great nights don't translate into words well). but it was good times. i need more nights like that.

so then yesterday at my parent's friends house i casually mentioned the impending apocalypse on december 21, 2012. and there 10 yr old daughter nearly screamed and they had to reassure her it wasn't true. and i felt kinda bad because even though i'm not really a fan of the children, she's not a bad kid at all. and i'm sure there are plenty of other 10 yr old girls much more worthy of a scare. whatever y'all know the mayans are right.

"event","So yesterday was wonderful for like elventy bazillion reasons. Here are four of them:

1. I got to be a part of fashion week! Like for realsies! It made me happy, because YES, I  really am <em>that </em>shallow.I tagged along with the illustrious ms. cheng to the swanky, swank, swank Rag and Bone after party in <a href=""http://www.hotelgansevoort.com/"">Hotel Gansevoort.</a> OMG we were on the rooftop penthouse. (to quote Amy, &quot;that's right, PENTHOUSE&quot;) overlooking the hudson, surrounded by far too many highly attractive people. The place was swarming with yummy male models (also yummy: the free margaritas, peach flavored). Even the dudes that were working the event were hot. I exchanged pleasantries with a beer promoter in a fedora. His name was Gianni. I shook Gianni's hand. Even that name is sexy, GIANNI. I love how it rolls off the tongue. Say it with me, GI-ANNI! It's so mellifluous, Italian is truly the most lyrical of languages. It's doubtful I'll ever be at a scene like that any time soon. But for one night I got to pretend I was on The Hills and that reality can be as beautiful as anything scripted. 

2. My boss gave me business cards! I have never had business cards. ALL I HAVE EVER WANTED IN LIFE IS BUSINESS CARDS. and now I have them. AND the best part is, is that they say I'm the &quot;Arts &amp; Entertainment&quot; editor, even though technically I'm just an intern. But my boss treats us like actual employees and I get paid (albeit not much) and have real responsibilities and and and they are shiny...does this make me a grown-up now?

3. I went shopping. I bought <a href=""http://www.pylones-usa.com/pylones/item.php?osCsid=85d343cb2032caec8a7bb9c1c468ae86&amp;item=PY-BCHORCH&amp;product=577"">this business card holder</a> (OF COURSE) at pylones. and a chunky necklace with lots of  beads and pearls on canal street which i successfully haggled down to 8 bucks (from10). and i bought joan didion's 'play it as it lays' which is a really disturbing book, though I've only read half of it thus far. Her prose is so sparse and minimalistic, like while reading the illegal abortion scene, I found myself squeamish because of what she DIDNT write. I'll reserve my final judgment after I'm done.

4. The new Okkervil River album came in the mail yesterday  (woohoo for free promo copies!) It is maybe the finest thing I've heard all year, or at least the most buoyant. I want to say it surpasses The Stage Names, but I think it's more accurate to say they are just two sides of the same coin. my review of it is due by monday, so I'll spend all today writing it.

""soooooooooooo

american idol is getting a 4th judge.

i mention this because....

do you remember that day we were stuffing envelopes at hoff? and there was an older woman helping us (i think her name was barbara, but i'm not sure). i don't think she technically worked at hoff, she was just volunteering or something. well anyways one day i was working with her and we were talking about life, and i mentioned how i freelanced blah blah blah music journalism etc. and she mentioned this girl that was a very, very close family friend who used to write for billboard magazine but then quit and went on to write songs for celine dion and kylie minogue. i just sorta nodded and said 'oh that's cool' ....
  
well it turns out that girl is now the 4th american idol judge, kara diguardi (or something like that!) that woman at hoff is like her aunt (well not in the biological sense, but you know) 
&nbsp;
my mind is BLOWN. 
  
because all i ever wanted in life is to meet simon...and now maybe i can talk to that woman at hoff and she can talk to kara and she can talk to simon and then i can meet simon and and and maybe i can have his babies!!!
 
feel free to tell your mom this too btw (except for the baby-making part)

OMG i want simon!

But Toni just texted me to say there is a $20 cover charge, but she's going anyway. So I ask you friends, is the Rock of Love dude&nbsp; and his god awful hair extensions really worth it? Hmmm.<br /><br />Two nights ago, a friend of a friend of mine was almost kicked out of a Bon Iver concert. Nick and I were laughing hysterically at how un-bad-ass that would have been (those of you who know Bon Iver know what I'm talking about, right?). Like just imagine getting thrown out of a show featuring a dude who writes stark, intense songs about solitude in the woods of Wisconsin, that'd be LAME, heh. Anyways the story goes like this. Nick's friend was under 21 so his older brother who was also with us bought him a beer. This scrawny bouncer dude (seriously *I* coulda taken that dude on!) was eyeing him the whole time and beckoned him outside where he threatened to kick him out of the show if he didn't pay up. So he coughed up a 20 and was allowed to come back in, haha. If the security dude was really doing his job he woulda just flat out kicked him out instead of asking for a bribe, so sketchy so corrupt, and then we kept seeing him do this to other people the whole night. On the way out Nick yelled out to him ""Treat yourself to a nice dinner"". LOL good times. <br /><br />anyways the actual show was fab. and far louder then the last time I saw him back in October. I should really post my <a href=""http://volume-knob.blogspot.com/"">VK</a> review pronto. <br /><br />This summer has been really bizarre otherwise.&nbsp; I'm in the running for a PAID internship (two words I have never once in my life thought I'd hear with regards to journalism) but even if i got it the pay is looow and would probably just barely cover transportation costs. sigh. <br /><br />One of the teachers at Hoff (the music school I've been doing intermitent reception work at) has offered to give me driving lessons. I might just take him up on it. <br /><br />umm there were other things i was going to say but umm yeah i forgot."

ANYWAYS. miranda, your conference was super. the catering, amazing (all that cheese, mmmm.) and of course all the academic stuff was fascinating. i enjoyed learning more about ""cinema/ media/ alternative"" stuffage. kudos! also it was so refreshing to be back in a setting where people use words like ""hegemony"", ""heteronormativity"" and ""diaspora"". as pretentious as it might sound, i so dearly miss that. i wish i could get my shit together for grad school. sigh. 

also i got dinner with camille yesterday. she's only in the NY for a few days and she told me about her trip to cincinati (visiting a fellow vassar grad). she ended up going to a creationist museum in kentucky. it sounded like the most awesomely horrifying place in the world and yes, such a place exists. there are exhibits that show&nbsp; humans living side by side with dinosaurs. and claim the grand canyon was formed in less then an hour (great flood, duh!) and that some dude lived to be 921, cause you know, it's in the bible. i don't mean to trivialize any of these religious views, or leaps of faith or whatever they are, but seriously i just think its dangerous when they institutionalized in museum form. just wow. also on this same trip they drove by the house of one of the kkk's head leaders (the massive confederate flag gives it away). it's actually in ohio - not the deep south, which sorta suprised me. 

this really furthers oscar wilde's theory ""when good americans die they go to paris. when bad americans die, they go to america."" haha. 

i JUST finished my heretic pride review. it's like 829 words of me inarticulately babbling about how brilliant it its. you should all BUY it tomorrow. in fact you should all buy one copy for each room of your house. that's how much it should permeate your life :P i'll post review when it's published on wednesday."

"event","in florida with the grandfolks. thanksgiving with them was nice. it was my first child-free thanksgiving, which made it awesome - normally all my little cousins are running around screaming and tugging my hair. so it was peaceful and yummy. best baked ziti and sweet potatoes ever. also after my grandpa said a nice short and sweet grace before dinner, wishing for peace on earth and all that good stuff, my grandma chimed in and said ""oh yeah, god i hope the president dies"" and it was hilarious and awesome just in her timing and mannerism. i guess you hadda be there.  

also we decorated their house for christmas, putting up two trees (one is decorated with white angels and birds and the other is all native american themed) and there are lots of moving, glowing, singing figurines everywhere. it is overwhelmingly awesome. sadly my grandma pulled her back setting up reindeer on her front lawn (cue lots of bad ""grandma got run over by a reindeer"" jokes) so now she is resigned to bed for the rest of the week. :( we are watching way too much court tv and playing scrabble. 

we get back to ny on tuesday night, and then i start my new job on wednesday - less than 13 hours later! ugh, i am dreading how exhausted i will be from packing, traveling etc. also directly after work i'm meeting up with june for sufjan - and then the next day tMG! fucking overwhelming. the bad. the good. and the better. all back to back to back.

um also i promised myself i'd write, write, write this week as it's the only free time i'll have till who knows when, but umm instead i ended up watching high school music (1 & 2!) and wow, it is awesome. no seriously, my sister and i watched with rapt attention for like 4 hours just smiling and giggling. so fucking entertaining. i cannot even fathom why. 

according to <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2138566/"">this article on slate.com</a> , it is awesome because , ""Guilty pleasures have always been a staple of teen culture. I doubt that any American adolescent has ever thought that Tiger Beat magazine or The Baby-Sitters Club series were unequivocally cool. And yet, like High School Musical, they are all successful partly because teens revel in cheesiness.""

see, this is where i disagree. i think a moratorium must be placed on liking anythign ""ironically"" because it is a lame way of saying ""i like something that is not cool enough to be liked on its own merit"" do adolescents even have a developed sense of irony? i hope not. 

ok maybe i should save rants like these for all those articles i should be writing.

""he hit me (it felt like a kiss)""&nbsp; as covered by grizzly bear is THE creepiest song ever. their rendition is so transformative that it renders the 1960s girl group original by the crystals impotent. first you take creepy-as-fuck lyrics which attempt to justify domestic violence as apprpriate behavior when enacted on cheating lovers. but then you take those lyrics and add eerie four part&nbsp; all-male harmonies and psych-folk freakout rhythms and and oh man, oh man. CREEPY and BRILLIANT. the reason i mention all of this is a. i went to see their free show tonight&nbsp; and it blew my brain away. and b. <a href=""http://www.thelmagazine.com/5/26/musicology/feature2.cfm?ctype=2"">i just published this review in The L Magazine (an NYC alt-weekly) </a><a href=""http://www.thelmagazine.com/5/26/musicology/feature2.cfm?ctype=2"">of their latest EP (which is really more like a mini-LP)</a><br />watch it here: 

<lj-embed id=""3"" />
<br /><br /><br />2. weird shit is rolling around in my stomach i had tiramasu and capachino (during grizzly bear's soundcheck at the cafe in the virgin mega store actually, haha) and then an hour later i had pumpkin beer and mozarella sticks with amy at this bar which is probably the only pro-red sox bar in all NY (there was a poster that said ""jesus hates the yankees, i'll post a photo later).&nbsp; random foodstuffs is a bad way to cope with feeling crappy, as i didn't get yet another job. blarg<br /><br />3. so as i was walking around looking for random foodstuffs, i thought a very specific thought. i thought, ""when the hell are the mountain goats&nbsp; not gonna&nbsp; be in the midwest,&nbsp; and back touring in ny, because i feel, in the words of my father ""lower than a curbstone, and that's pretty damn low and tmg are maybe the only thing that can slightly upswing my mood, even though they probably won't be back for a good year or so, cause they were just here"" i swear i nearly grumbled this outloud in what would be a pretty damn self-absorbed sigh. anyways the second i get home i reading through the usual blog roll and lo and behold what do i see tMG in NY 11/29! YES. the only thing is, is that its at NYU and might be an all-students only thing? i'm not sure. but dammit tickets go on sale tomorrow and i will try like hell to go. you should too."

Despite this, do not ask me how I ended up in Union Square, holding hands and skipping throughout the park at midnight Saturday night in flip flops, with total strangers waiting for a non-existent Jens Lekman to show up for over an hour after his concert. Alas, I was 2 inches away from introducing myself to the 15th sexiest man in Sweden (jens personally came out into the audience following the show) when security kicked everyone out, thus solidifying Webster Hall's reputation as the WORST venue in NYC (well maybe roseland is a little worse, but its a close call).

I am trying not to ponder the insanity of that statement. Most insane fans ever. I spoke to over a dozen people and I was the ONLY one who had never seen him live before. (most of them had seen him upwards of 10 times!).&nbsp; i might have been a total virgin to the morrissey concert-going experience, but judging from the looks of some of these people, at least i wasn't a total virgin (heyyyyOH low, low blow, i know). a bunch of people came bearing bouquets of gladiolas and sporting pompadours. one girl had a t-shirt that had these lyrics on it: ""I wear black on the outside cause black is how i feel on the inside"". My emo-ness pales in comparison to those people, I thought. And yet, I totally was one of those people.<br /><img alt="""" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2188/1735059482_5ef170bda3.jpg?v=0"" /><br />There were also a ton of Europeans there -people based their entire vacations around his string of 5 NY shows. I got coffee with a woman from Holland. Also two British people got in a fight in line. this woman told a dude to stop smoking, as the wind was blowing smoke in her face. And he screamed at her and called her ""a fucking fascist pig"". but the funny thing was it was soo freaking adorable because they were both british. Because when anything is said with a british accent it is adorable - fucking fascist pigs included. Also the woman who got yelled at asked me if we had met before in Dublin or at the Alexandra Palace (it's a venue in London). Um nope. And once I spoke, she just looked at me kinda funny and said ""OH you're an American girl"". Um yep. There were some semi-normal/cool people though - I met a haverford physics prof (he had an assistant teaching class that day so he could see moz!) he had traveled to every state capital, which i found pretty neat. Also I ALMOST got the shirt off morrissey's back -all hell broke loose when he threw it off- pure insanity. ultimately i didn't get it. I would make some lame pun on how ""i just didn't earn it yet baby"" but that joke isn't funny anymore... OH double lame pun! <a href=""http://volume-knob.blogspot.com/2007/10/morrissey-hammerstein-ballroon-nyc.html"">more details on the ol' blog!</a><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2258/1735064158_725c6e29be.jpg?v=0"" /><br />Also I am NOT ashamed (although maybe I should be?) to admit that I cried when he sang ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want (Lord Knows It Would Be the First Time)""&nbsp; Because no man has defined my inadequacies better through any medium ever. As long as (british) people feel inadequate morrissey will always be relevant. <br /><br />in other news i'm hacking up a lung, i must have picked up sooo many germs between hoff and cmj all week. ahh too many people in cramped close quarters.<br /><br />Random tangent - my dad just said the most adorable/pathetic thing ever. He asked me if ""mom had Google on the computer"" AWWWWWW computer illiterate dad!"

""rocking"" and ""bass clarinet"" normally do not belong in the same sentence, but islands sorta rendered that rule moot. one of the violin players played while simtaneously twirling down a pole. (there were an abnormal amount of stripper poles for a bar that wasn't a strip club, ha). i got to chat with them too (such was the nature of the venue -the boundary between artist and audience was essentially obliterated, considering the stage was barely a step at the back of a bar.) very cool dudes. afterwards i treked all the way, all the way uptown only to get shut-out of the M.I.A. show.(they only accepted 250 badges, otherwise you needed&nbsp;to have a ticket -it's a 3,000 capacity venue!)&nbsp;major bummer. especially since kristen was waiting for me inside.&nbsp;sadness.<br /><br />but the real&nbsp;delightful surprise of the night were black kids.&nbsp;<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://arien-laurelin.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://arien-laurelin.livejournal.com/""><b>arien_laurelin</b></a></div>&nbsp;have you heard of them? i ask you that because they hail from jacksonville, fl.&nbsp;&nbsp;(and i'm&nbsp;sure you&nbsp;know all the young folks in j-ville, right? of course.)see, here's the&nbsp;part where i could be discussing&nbsp;how&nbsp;only two of the five members are actually black. and the other three maybe represent ironic cultural appropriation? but that's really totally meaningless, cause all they do is make me wanna ""dance, dance DANCE"". and it's me. and i NEVER dance. so there. &nbsp;pure synth pop fluff, they've got the&nbsp;whole early 80s vibe going on. all they've released is a demo, which sounds lightyears beyond a demo. also how can a song titled ""I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How to Dance With You"" possibly suck?<br /><br />i ran into three vassar people too. (two distinct separate groups of vassar people actually!) some dude who was in one of my&nbsp;poli sci&nbsp;classes actually pointed at me and said ""hey vassar!"" and i was like um yeah! it was kinda disorienting given the non-vassar context, but still&nbsp;sweet to have some collegiate solidarity nonetheless.&nbsp;<br /><br />also a guy who i met a few night earlier at mates of state said hi to me and actually asked me if i wrote the felice brothers review on cmj (which i did!)&nbsp;and that was way, way, way disorienting&nbsp; - to be recognized for writing something- weirdness.&nbsp;<br /><br />tonight presents a major dilemma - do i go see justice with kristen? or&nbsp;do i go&nbsp;to&nbsp;spoon alone? or will i get shut out of&nbsp;which ever one i choose? help me peoples!<br />regardless i'm seeing erik friedlander in the afternoon - woohoo!<br />&nbsp;"

""STAY POSITIVE"" it took me a back -coming from craig finn - a dude who made a career singing (or rather brilliantly shouting) about the profoundity of wasting, wasted youth thriving on cocaine and catholic guilt by the banks of the mississippi, while quoting kerouac and fronting the rawking-est ""bar-band"" in america. there are maybe five individuals i could possibly accept the 'stay positive' mantra from. and most of them are dead. or fictional. but if craig finn wants be to keep my chin up, by golly i will. his entire interview alongside some nigerian author i never heard of was totally inspiring. i'm also a complete geek when it comes to hearing writers (whether it be songwriters, novelists, essayists etc.) talk about the writing process. i also liked how he talked about the universality of puberty sucking regardless of geographic locale. <br /><br />ummm also i don't know what i'm doing AT ALL. i've been scrolling through gazillions of job listings, some worth pursuing, some not. i've looked into headhunting/job agencies and they all seem to be targeted towards corporate, financial and/or legal businesses and other such environments i would be ill-equiped and fucking uncomfortable and unhappy as hell working in. ugggh. i took a tour of the new school with june and it was really awesome. she totally inspired me to potentially pursue an MFA in creative writing. i love how the new school has a creative NON-fiction (no, that's not an oxymoron) program. plus they DON'T require the GREs! of course it's also crazy competitive and expensive. sigh. <br /><br />whadamigonnadowithmylife?"

last night was EXACTLY what i needed. nevermind all this job/boy/drama/crap. gimme 29 swedish people in super hero capes singing about treehouses. i'm from barcelona are perfect and amazing, (if a bit geographically confused, hehe) i was contemplating buying a ticket all week, but i was holding off since it was in the middle of nowhere brooklyn and i was worried about getting lost,  but lo and behold i got an email from CMJ offering  spot on the guestlist so i snatched it up. and holy crap i feel re-born or at the very least, loved. i am still reeling from the awesomeness - my mopiness has been washed away by the swedes who told me to not give up on my dreams. also there were massive balloons and kazoos and use of the word 'extincted"" during the stage banter (oh how i adore emanuel's limited english). OH and i got to sing into the microphone!!!! (to the ba ba ba in 'collection of stamps""!) oh just look at the pics. 
<img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1204/1041206239_e955444a48.jpg?v=0"" />
i made friends (ok, well i facebooked) this cool guy named nick barcelona who got to go on stage cause of his apt last name. also he kept asking me if i was going to the national show next week. i was considering going cause its free and now i just might. even though my chances of running into mr. barcelona about a zillion to one at a crowded outdoor show in the middle of nyc.

 also the harlem shakes opened. i got drunk with them and a bunch of people at the lake behind blodget at vassar 2 years ago. (were you there nikki and/or nina?) good times. one of them told me he was an american studies major at yale. nice to see he's doing something awesome with his life, gives me hope. 

friday amy and i are going to wes' loft party. should be interesting. and this weekend i might be in Bethlehem, PA helping the sis move half her stuff (the other half will come later in the month)  and maybe going outlet shopping. i so desparately need direction in my life. sigh."

"event","so i just hit a new low - i applied for a job as a researcher at us weekly. vassar will probably disown me. this is in addition to me applying to be a fact-checker at tv guide, which i could so totally do. if they asked me what time law and order is on, i'd say 'all the time!'.

anyways work at hoff is holding me over in the meantime until i can find a fulltime real job. yesterday noah prank-called me, while i was working the phones. i picked up and said the usual 'good afternoon, hoff barthelson music school, how may i help you' and without missing a beat he said 'you can help me by not giving me such an attitude' for a minute i freaked out and wanted to cry. but then he started laughing at me. i was this close to not connecting him to his mom. silly boy. don't hassle the hoff (lame pun, i know)

also one of the music teachers wrote a song about me! i was sitting in lobby, manning the phones and all of sudden i hear michael the guitar teacher playing a few basic chords on the piano, trying to tune a classroom of 9-10 year old guitar camp students  or something and he starts singing ""jessica, jessica she's 22 but she doesn't look it, she doens't have her driver's license, jessica"" HAHAHA it was pretty hilarious. he seriously couldn't get over me being a college grad - like he asked everyone in the offfice how they thought i was. normally this would piss me off to no end, but for some bizarre reason i found it geniunely endearing. 

also yesterday i did an interview for CMJ with natasha of bat for lashes, who sorta sound like bjork-lite and are heavily endorsed by thom yorke. i think it went rather well -although she may have misunderstood me when i went on this tangent about 'freak-folk' and how the press likes to lump artists together which is so reductionist and diminshes the innovation of the individual -anyway i think she thought i was trying to do that to her, when really i was just critiquing how the press tends to do that cause its easy to do that. also she used the phrase ""liberated imagination"" a lot sorta as a result of being a former pre-school teacher, which i rather liked. now i just need to transcribe the whole thing and write up the article for friday. kenny also asked me to write a dvd review up for the next issue as well, so i suppose i am proving myself capable in some capacity."

the past few days have been exhausting. wilco was effing INSANE in the best possible way. i met random cool people and watched two strangers coordinate a trip to Israel (twas the most bizarre, beautiful coincidence) also one of those strangers , melissa facebookd me and invited me to the free neko case concert, i think i'll take her up on it. Also i bought a t-shirt made 70% of bamboo. some guy standing by the merch table half-jokingly commented ""what is this a minor threat/fugazi approved thing"" to which i replied ""you know i wrote my undergrad thesis on minor threat/fugazi"" random guy was like ""woah, what did you write, that they were awesome"".  yeah basically. he seemed like a cool guy, he was all alone cause his ""friends liked the fray"" - i'll stop babbling about random dude now. but i think the point i am trying to get at is why can't i put my concert networking skils to practical use? like finding a job. concerts are like the only setting in which i'm bold and confident. grrr

yesterday noah and fellow intern kristen found a claw machine  (you know the arcade machines with stufed animals in them) outside on the sidewalk in front of a deli! we tried to win this hat that said 'Puerto Rico"" on it. none of us won but it was funny in a 'you had to be there' way. also i met dave's mom yesterday for the first time - she was really nice. it was during intermission at his community band concert yesterday (he plays sax with a group of about 80 or so people mainly senior citizens/college/high school kids) they play showtunes, movie themes, standard patriotic band fair every thursday at a park (this week it was indoors at a local high school cause of severe thunderstorms). its all so quaint.and while they sounded amazing from a technical standpoint i sat through a andrew lloyd webber medley, i must really like the boy. i must admit i heart sousa though - stars and stripes forever is the shit!

also in exciting internship news, i get to interview this cool british singer whom thom yorke adores! i get full feature inthe print mag."

"event","so i just cancelled a job interview with this marketing place - i figure i have the rest of my life to suffer through shittily paid corporate employment. More importantly I just secured a month's worth of summer's employment at the Hoff Barthelson music school filling in for the receptionist. Really simple office work for people I know and like (Noah and Adam's (of colbert report fame) mom and aunt) not bad for $10 an hour, not bad at all. 

also i've been enjoying this summer way too much. so many people and places and bands etc. had lunch with melodylemming, who is awesome, on thursday at this adorable sandwich shop (mmm onion rings and egg cremes), we should totally do it again sometime - also it got me in the mood to go hardcore book shopping, not that i should be adding to the growing stack by my bed. 

then on friday it was off to brooklyn, sleepover at amy's!! dinner with her family was fantastic, as is her dad's hardcore audio-amplifier thingy. we played cranium (turbo edition!) with her sister and yvone. saturday breakfast at the dinner (where i got two scrambled eggs, has browns, toast, orange juice and coffee for $4.75! woohoo non-gentrification). and then it was off to coney island where i was tempted to make gratutitous references to ""The Warriors"" (best cult classic EVER) we played arcade games and watched the mermaid parade, which is exactly what it sounds like - mermaids on parade! good times. 

board games/cult films are sorta the theme of my summer. played rummy 500 and phase 10 with david and his friends last night (most frustratingly fun game ever). also netflix is brilliant - i FINALLY saw ""Eraserhead"" most WTF movie ever, yet sooo good. 

 Tonight is Wilco - WILCO!!! ZOMG so excited, last time i saw them was nearly 3 years ago - october 2004 with kevin.  can't wait! i will do a massive picture post of mermaids, wilco, lily allen etc. once all the pics are uploaded to flickr."

cmj is such a tease, i love it, oh how i love it. free tickets, cds, really cool bands just popping in to play an acoustic gig here or there (like brakesbrakesbrakes and they played porucine or pineapple!). and then i get to blog about&nbsp;it.&nbsp;my supervisor is awesome, her bosses are even awesome too. sigh. i need money.&nbsp;i will cry when it is august. for multiple reasons.

also my laptop died a few days ago (i'm using my sis's now). no surprise really. grah. i&nbsp;went to the mac store. one the guys there was pretty cute and tried to sell me a comp. he said he went to college for three years and then dropped out to 'pursue the music thing'. hawt. i am thinking of going there wednesday to actually buy a comp (grad present from the parents)."

me: my seminar held class at a bakery 
dave: how is vassar even a school?

yeah, it was amusing. also founder's day was amusing. charlie the unicorn on the bridge, omg! and swings, omg swings.&nbsp; i was stably tipsy all day. and even watched the fireworks from the TH path. it's almost sad that i have to consider that a major victory. but it's gotten to the point where i can't be so hard on myself, as it only rehashes and undredges pain from the past. whatever, i did something i couldn't do two years ago. go me, i guess : /

also i adore the dude who sells vinyl and bootlegs in the college center. he always has such a super selection and great recomendations. i bought the mountain goats 'beautiful rat sunset' (yes, i've heard it all, i just didn't own it til now!) but also i wanted something new, or at least new to me so i asked him to suggest something. he asked me what i was in the mood for. just something 'different' or rather something i could listen to without any preconceived notions of what it would sound like. so he immediately points to neutral milk hotel! LOL, i laugh and smile and nearly squeal with ecstasy and tell him 'yes, that album saved my life four years ago, blah blah blah' it's sorta a college cliche by now, but rightfully so. anyways he tries again and picks out akron/family. i again laugh, because i bought it from him last year. hahah. by now he's like 'lemme see if i can stump you' and he does. with the gun club. i'm listening to it now. and am really digging it. it's like gothic, country-tinged punkabily. but from the 80s.&nbsp; it's something i would never normally have picked out. but i'm sure as hell glad i did. 

also he tells me that he got dragged on vacation to miami (how one is coerced into vactioning anywhere, i have no clue) anyway the only redeeming part of his trip was getting to see yo la tengo live. and they blew the house down. also he used to own a store but the landlord kicked him out 4 days ago. i felt really bad. cause that dude rocks.

In the meantime, feel free to drop a note or two directly in the hole. I like mail, even when it's in a hole in the wall! <br /><br />Also I am feeling terribly conflicted. I am thinking must figure out a way to get to Brooklyn May 11th, as the Mountain Goats are playing a FREE show at Sound Fix! FREE TMG! However, I have not 1, not 2, but 3 10-15 page research papers due over the span of May 14 and 15th!!. GRRRRRRR Honestly what do I do? <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://diskothiq.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom;"" /></a><a href=""http://diskothiq.livejournal.com/""><b>diskothiq</b></a></div>, help me out here. also is it just JD or are you playing too? not that that has any influence in my decision whatsoever, but the press release makes it sound as if it's only JD. also sorry if i sound really narcasistic for you thinking your show should revolve around my work schedule. It's just a killer stressful time of year. <br /><br />um also this weekend was really, really great. cause i saw people and life and tried on absurdly tacky prom dresses for no good reason other then to look absurd and tacky alongside deb and amy and laura. and also this weekend marks the first time i got really drunk without suffering a hangover. instead i woke up feeling alert and refreshed. twas really odd. the past week has been filled with too much thinking and still it circuitously continues.<br /><br />i truly hate response papers with a fiery passion."

"event","nooooooooooooooo! sanjaya got voted off! i am so sad and might just wear my hair in a ponyhawk (po-hawk?) tomorrow as a visual manifestation of my devotion and consequent mourning. to further express my sadness, kelly and i built a gingerbread house (well at least set the foundation for it, we'll decorate it tomorrow) which will serve a shrine of sorts. also the sugar icing paste stuff that came in the gingerbread house kit is the most disgustingly fun thing ever, it smells (and tastes!) like elmers glue and it also leaves the same residue on your hands. i think i got some in my hair. 

also&nbsp; i ate amazing homemade indian food at prof varghese's house with my AMCL seminar class. also she has a cat. and it's name is the indian word for cat. i love cats. 

tomorrow is AMCL thesis celebration dinner&nbsp; and beach house concert. also i need to finish my AMCL tv annotated bibliography and write my essay for some journalism award thing the fellowship office is offering. former prof,. meg downey finally got back to me about writing a reccomendation. i was really worried cause it took her nearly a week for her to respond. plus she's now working as managing editor at some newspaper in tennessee so it's not like i could contact her in person. so i was about to ask another editor person for a rec., but luckily now i don't have to. phew. i need money. 

i've been having a lot of weird conversations and dreams (including yet another tmg one) lately. wow i need sleep."

"event","I'm really freaking out. I suck at transitions, but at least during former transitions, i knew what i was transitioning to (i.e. college!!)&nbsp; There was a set day and time and place.  but now in literally 50 days i'm just stumbling into a numb nothingness.&nbsp; i'm trying, trying really hard, emailing alums, applying steadily to non-profits, looking into fellowships etc. &nbsp; but it's hard. i lack connections and resources and direction. i don't know where i should be looking. so far just nyc - but i want out of my house so, so badly - my eyelids are welling up with tears cause i just feel so powerless. i haven't the faintest idea how to look for an apartment, let alone pay for one. I COMPLETELY LACK LIFE SKILLS. and i totally blame myself and my dependencies and phobias.and i don't want pity, i just want a job. 

and meanwhile i have 3 research papers which seem utterly pointless in the grand scheme of things. 

last night was really great though. david and i saw blades of glory, which essentially confirmed will arnett's place on my list of favorite human beings ever. and dav gave me a wonderfully sweet birthday present, a black leather bound journal, which i love plus the this hilarious magnet which features bill clintons facial features super-imposed on&nbsp; hillary's head with the caption ""hillbillery"" haha. he bought in d.c. while touring his future law school. but thoughts of september are making me wistful and it is unhealthy to project that far ahead. right now i only want to be able to assert a firm level of autonomy and my inability to do so is making me feel inferior to most of the people i care the most about. that came out wrong. but makes sense in my head.

i also wanted to write something here about pleasure and guilt and the body or maybe just my body and i think catholicism and ugh. i'm getting ridiculous."

in other news, i ran into eileen (second thesis reader/AMCL chair) at the library&nbsp; and improtu-ly beggged for funding for an unpaid internship that i'm not even sure i have yet. (the CMJ interview is on monday) she said in the past they haven't provided stipend's cause the demand would be too high. huh? wha? there are 6, count'em 6 AMCL majors in the senior class and only a handful of underclassmen. it's not like the department doesn't have tons of cash floating around either. i told her how vassar now, as of this spring, has an unpaid internship fund but it's not open to the class of 07.&nbsp; so she told me it couldn't hurt to write a proposal for the AMCL dept anyway, even though she made it seem like a fruitless endeavor. ARGH. i want to cry. <br /><br />in other, other news i had dinner with shultz, former high school teacher and current vassar prof, and some people i haven't seen since high school. shultz makes me want to live with refugees. me who has literally never left the time zone me. he is that kind of person who can instill awe and guilt and inspiration and more guilt. he talked a lot about this book he's working on about 'unintended consequences'&nbsp; of history (which yeah, is like everything) but it's specifically 12 stories. one is the big hole in south africa. this hole is apparently responsible for institutionalizing the ideology of apartheid way before it's legal inception in the 1940s, as well as the entire diamond market monopoly. really fascinating stuff. shultz is also related to alfred dreyfus of the dreyfus affair!&nbsp; and has done more human rights work than is possibly fathomable. the man is walking history. i should email him about maybe doing something of substance with my life and getting myself out of this hole of self pity, woe is me i'll never have a job crap. i mean i am lucky to have a bed with walls around me. priorities people. <br /><br />additionally we talked a bit about my thesis and he told me he might have one of his current high school students contact me. apparently this kid is a juliard trained marimba player, who played at a fundraising 'jam for sudan' concert. said kid is also obsessed with scandanavian neo-nazi death metal and&nbsp; might be writing a research paper on it. i know not a lot (really, nothing) about it.<br /><br />holyfuckingcrap 'sky blue sky' is the best album of the year.

"event","""and all your friends are moving to London, while the cherry trees are still in blossom""<br /><br />and then jens goes on to sing about buying wedding rings from vending machines and eating french fries with lots of ketchup and mayonaise. and it is all very quaint and self-aware of&nbsp; the raw naivete and melancholy exuded by such a sentiment and essentially right now that sentiment is exactly how i feel. <br /><br />yesterday felt like two yesterdays: trekking into the city in torrential downpours to the swanky conde nast building in the morning. and then heading back up to vassar in the afternoon where my eyes just glazed over my thesis all night. <br /><br />the interview was eh. i can't see myself fitting in there. i just can't. everyone for the most part was thin, blonde&nbsp; and effortlessly stylish. conde nast owns every publication ever -the new yorker, vogue, vanity fair, wired, gq, glamour, lucky, self, a bunch of bridal, food, golf publications etc. therefore they <i>have</i> to look that way, like probably legally mandated to.  i looked ridiculous and awkward in an ill-fitting suit. this other girl in the lobby who was also waiting to be interviewed had this flowy white dress with brown flowers and a little coordinated cardigan. she will get a job. the woman who interviewed me was the typical perky, pleasant HR person. i highly doubt anything will come of it, as i just come across as inarticulate and unpersonable most of the time anyway regardless of the context. besides editorial assistants get paid shit and work long hours and yeah probably not for me.<br /><br />i have a hunch the CMJ interview (which is a week from monday) will be the total antithesis. maybe i'll wear my jens t-shirt, or better yet my andrew bird one to the the interview. i need to beg, beg, beg the AMCL department for funding if i do happen to take on an unpaid internship though. i can sorta make the argument that it works as further pursual of my thesis topic. i don't know. all i want is to know what i want. that and to finish my thesis- the final copy is due in less than 48 hours!<br /><br />someone give me a job."

"event","<font size=""1"">ugghh i feel so exhausted. crushing myself by the weight of collassal&nbsp; expectations, which in reality probably don't even exist.<br /><br />i am worried about the future, and money,&nbsp; and not having any and my mom pointed out how i do this thing where i pretend i don't have any even though i sorta do. i get it from my dad. we seriously hoard and are afraid to spend. this is a man who, in 2007 returned the printer we bought in 2003!&nbsp; and&nbsp; actually got his full money's worth.&nbsp; better yet, he doesn't even use the printer, or the computer, obviously no has email address (""i work for the US postal service, why do i need an email address?"" he says). ANYWAYS my family is pretty well off financially considering neither of my parents went to college (well my mom did some weird 2 yr equestrian program at a farm in virginia, but i really don't think that counts.) so basically me being one of the only people to graduate entails me being successful and thus making copious amounts of money -cause success clearly = $$$, right. i know i will disappoint. because of lack of motivation or interest in lucrative corporate industries and making hasty decisions and living the life of an unpaid intern for 3 fucking summers. and meanwhile my sister will be having the time of her life studying </font><font size=""1"">herpetology (reptiles and amphibians y'all) in costa rica. i have never left the fucking eastern seaboard, cause of a little thing called fear (ambigious, amorphous 'fear' being completely distinct and separate from THE phobia) ARRGH.<br /><br />i am lucky to have a stable, for the most part supportive family. i just super-impose i how i expect them to assess my future decisions and can't help but feel inadequate.&nbsp; i just don't want to live in my parent's basement in the room i've had since i've been 7. it feels so static, so regressive. i lack autonomy without an income, or a driver's license or a future.<br /><br />it is unhealthy to project right now. for the most part otherwise, i'm content. </font>"

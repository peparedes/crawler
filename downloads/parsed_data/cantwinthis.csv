I thought I was pretty much over that, think again. I just keep looking at everything going on around me and it makes me want to go back in time, or maybe not go back, but just start over completely. I'm just not happy with anyone,I think I'm too scared or something. I think I'm talking crazy and I probably don't make any sense. Oh well...I know what I mean."

"event","Well,I'm sitting here kind of bored. Things are getting better. At first it was just so hard to believe, it was just a dream to me. Now,its starting to sink in, and I miss him ALOT. I had a weird dream last night, a very weird dream. If he is looking down on us now, he definitely knows how much we care. He's probably even laughing at some of the stuff that has happened. 

On a lighter note, I had a whole lot of fun today. A few people went over to Somer's house to make our Macbeth movie for English. It is the most random thing I've ever seen. haha. I picked out new glasses today. I pick them up next week.

"event","This doesn't even seem real. I keep waiting for someone to tell me it didn't happen and he's really ok. I can't believe it. I've lost people before,but not someone this close. I didn't realize how much I really cared about him until now,and now it's too late to tell him. I hope I see him again someday. There are so many memories. 

I always knew when he drove by my house. He revved up his motor every time he drove by. I always said to myself,""there goes Corey Jones."" I can't do that anymore. I've realized you take the smallest things for granted. You need to live life to the fullest and if you have something you want to tell someone, don't put it off. You may never get the chance to say it.

I can't believe there won't be any more visits when he's on his way home, just to talk or see his new system. No more staying on the phone until 3 in the morning or him singing to me (I'll always remember that song),doing anything he could to cheer me up,he never wanted to see anyone upset. When I was crying,while most people would've gotten annoyed and just left, he held me closer and told me everything would be alright.
 
It's weird to think I used to ride to school with him every morning. Then I saw him every day, it wasn't a big deal. I wish I could see him, just one more time so I could tell him how I felt. He never knew how much he meant to me. 

I can't even write all the things I'm thinking right now. I don't understand how things like this can happen. People aren't supposed to die when they're 20. Corey Jones will definitely be missed."

I went to Liberty Wednesday night and I had a pretty good time. It's sad that I felt more welcomed there than I do sometimes at Mt. Vernon. It just seems like alot of people there are too wrapped up in the drama that they don't really pay attention  to the important things. Sometimes I feel invisible when I walk in there. There is just something about the people from Liberty that makes me feel like I fit in more with them."

Well,Im gonna go.Once again my brother wont leave me alone,hes trying to see what im doing on the computer."

Clarity Process (Rise Records) and Her Candane (Sound vs. Silence). they're both from out west (portland and SLC) and could really use support. they were amazing to see at the barely legal house on tuesday and were really fun to hang out with afterward.

its a free fucking show people...be there."

"event","wow. what a fucking day (yesterday).  i hadnt slept in more than 24 hours by the time brandon had gotten here. we talked for a minute before we headed up to atomic to see coheed and cambria. i figured they'd have some promotional shit to sign, so i brought nothing with me. they were only giving out the promo posters to those who either had a cd with them, or bought one at the store. i wasnt planning on doing that, so i asked a guy (the right guy, apparently) if i could maybe just buy one. he brought me one and said ""just dont tell anyone."" they did the drawing for the tix before the the signing and of course, with my luck i didnt win. fortunately, i made brandon go up and get a tix even after he told me he was ""too lazy"". they called out the second tix number and brandon come sauntering up. i said is that you and he's like ""ha, i guess so"" we got on the guestlist. since i was over by the records when the line started forming, i basically became first and had my poster signed. it was ""thanks, thanks""..see ya at the show"" and i was outta there. i got to the car and the first thing i said was ""man, im such a retartd."" i felt so lame being 24 and all nervous and embarrassed. 

ok, basically cause im sick of updating this livejournal thing now, im going to sum the rest up real quick-like. 

went the the show right before funeral for a friend
funeral for a friend..good, but unimpressive live
rainer maria..i was disappointed until they played tinfoil. the first song i fell in love with by them. absolutely amazing.
coheed and cambria..no words can describe how i felt."

"event","its over. so quickly and intensly just like it started. 
and parts of me dont care.
and parts of me dont feel it.

i'll be crying for a long fucking time. i dont know if i did this one in or if he did or if it did itself in. so self-destructing i knew weeks ago it would happen. i suck as a girlfriend. too many rules that should never have to be followed. probably all made up in my head to satisfy some controlling something. im crying right now. so hard i can barely see. 

and i know its all my fault. i know i stated what i did and made it what it was. through complications due to illness or alcohol induced madness i was the one who said its done. he did nothing like he once had. accepted it like it was ok and fell asleep. i packed my things and i walked away.

a christmas gift i'd never thought i'd receive in a million years wasted on a bus ticket and a cab. i just wanted to be warm. no more walking. no more carrying all those things. no more thinking about it. just getting to where im going to fall asleep after a short note to unfortunately keep it fresh in my mind. 

and parts of me care so much.
and parts of me feel it so bad.
but mostly my parts regret and hope they'll mend soon."

"event","living in milwaukee, its hard not to know who forever is forgotten is. its not hard, however, to completely overlook them as ""just another local band"". i never really took the chance to really listen to them until recently when i went on a short but intense weekend tour with them. 

it started out on friday with a show here at home. the band played well with more hits than misses. there was a good turn out with alot of new faces and that always makes shows you've been to a few times even better. milwaukee has always seemed to respond well to FIF and i never took the time to understand this until i saw them out of their element and spent many hours in a van with them.

saturday we headed out for Goshen IN. to play with josiah and fall river. there was a good crowd, lots of kids and some parents so they had to clean up the act a little. i video taped what i could which was harder than i thought and went out to see how the crowd was responding to the band. if you know anything about FIF, you know that their music is very technical. just when you think a mosh part is coming up, they change it at the last minute and do something completely different. this didnt seem to bother the kids in the least. the more they tried to figure it out, the more they tried to follow it and the more they tried to follow it, the more fun they seemed to be having. i headed over to the merch table about halfway through the last song and found a line of kids with money in hand. it was good to see that kids could like something good even though it wasnt on some major label or featured on MTV2. i sold what i could until the band was done and then just sat back and watched everyone interact with the crowd. we left that night to head up to flint, mi to stay with a friend before the show in detroit.

when these guys arent totally ripping into eachother, wait, they're always ripping into eachother. if its not everyone against one person, its one person against everyone else. the only things i did for the 3+ hour drive from goshen to flint were laugh and sleep. actually, thats all i did for probably 90% of the trip and i think in total i only got about 7 hours of sleep the entire weekend.

after terrorizing the local sunday mall goers in flint, we took off for detroit to play bottlerocket fest. the line up looked pretty grim and when we got there at about 2 in the afternoon the crowd was pretty sparse. i set up my stuff in the merch area which was in another building with no heat. i basically sat there and waited for FIF to go on freezing my ass off. after about 6 hours of that, they went on and i grabbed the video camera. i felt a little better about taping this time because i'd gotten a chance to really see what they do and how they perform on stage from the night before. they played really well even after being tired and cold and to a mediocre sized crowd. i could tell that the kids were into them even though it took awhile for them to really get out there and try dancing. once they did though, you could see that they were really enjoying the music. after the set, we stuck around a bit to sell some merch and headed home.

i'd seen each member of FIF around milwaukee either just at shows, at the R.M. house or at a midnight Tron movie but never realized how talented each one was. they all have their distinct parts and they put them together amazingly. i regret that it took me this long to actually know and understand this. my favorite parts of the weekend were getting to know the guys a little better (some too well maybe) and watching them interact with people who only had great things to say about them. seeing kids come up to praise their music made me really proud to know such an incredible band. i wish i could get to know all the bands that i like on this level, but since thats next to impossible to do, i revel in the fact that Forever is Forgotten is one band that i did."

WHATTHEFUCKEVER. i know thats not the case and know that i just keep finding people that are shit. they're either super conceited or all wrapped up in boys or some other lame subject that they're too busy to think about anything or anyone else. nuts to all you fucks!

secondly, fuck boys. another waste of time/energy/space/oxygen. we wont get into too many details but if you screw me, prepare to be screwed. just be glad it wasnt worse. because it fucking could've been.

my roommates suck too. they either want to smoke pot in the house or have all sorts of issues that make no sense. i swear i keep finding these people. we'll see how long this lasts.

to all those who stumble upon this...this is my alternate journal. the one that doesnt have my friends on it. the one i can use to bitch about them on. thats why this will most likely always sound negative. 

if any of you that happened to stumble upon this can cut hair, let me know. i need a fucking haircut bad."

"event","so my first entry. a fucking livejournal. i need to come up with a way to spruce it up. ""did i just say spruce?"" i think i've gotten addicted to that show ""The O.C."". partly because it takes place in california (even if it is in orange county) but mostly because the nerd rides a skateboard and the goodie goodie chick drinks heavily. its lame i know, fucking tv shows but this one gets to me somehow. oh well.

so tons of good shows coming up. tons. underoath then suicide file in chicago, wings of scarlet/coma eternal, blood in blood out, and my friends are having a show here. im all excited 'n shit. anyway, i need to get things done so i'll update this in awhile."

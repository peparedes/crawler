"event","What a difference a few years make.  It seems weird to think that at age 16, you were lucky if you were up late enough to watch late night TV.  Now, a few years later, you are a loser if you are home early enough to watch late night TV.  Just wanted to add that in.

Yeah, so I think I got my boss in trouble.  I'll be sure to put up anything that develops from this, but this could get really interesting.  He's been leaving shift like 4 hours early, and not punching out, so he can collect for a whole shift.  More on this as I get it.

My gf is coming home soon, which is gonna be really cool, but she has to play moderator between her mothers boyfriends daughters, which is horse shit, cause its not like that are 10.  They are in their 20's.  Oh well, I'm just glad I'm dating my girlfriend, and not someone who is as immature as this guys daughters.  Although I do feel bad judging these girls, it does seem like bull shit that my girlfriend has to babysit them, but I'll at least wait until I meet them to say whether or not I like them.  At least give them a chance.

THANKSGIVING!!!!!!!!!!!!  A time to give thanks and get fat.  I am going to go to like 2627453 houses and eat as much as possible.  I may be sleeping at my girlfriends house the night before, and have an early lunch with them, then go to my dads and eat there, then go wherever they will take me, and probably finish off the night with some drinkins.  I'll be sure to let you know how it goes.

Peace love and holla.

Also, I just got a new job at Best Buy at the Liberty Tree Mall, so everyone is getting something from there for Christmas/Kwanzaa.

All my luck goes out to Soaring J for their show for important people.  There is nothing but skill in that band.  Well, skill and Speedy, but I'm not the type to carry a grudge.

The paintball team (SWAT) is going really good, and we are getting ready for the winter by getting ready to go back to Boston Paintball for a few monthes.  Damn you Mother Nature.

I have to go talk to a doctor this thursday about surgery for my knee.  We have to sit down and discuss my knee, do some X-Rays and all that shit, and see if I need the surgery now, and if so, what kind of surgery it will be.  Unfortunatly it comes at a really bad time for SWAT because we are trying to expand our team, and it's gonna be hard to do that with one of the captains out.  Luckily, we have very competent people in Scarface 8-Ball and Moneybags.

Myself and three friends of mine (Sloanie Balonie, Brownie and Kevin) found a house for rent it Wakefield, and we have to go meet with the landlord this week to sign the agreement and give a deposit.  Now we have drunken nights at AJ's to look forward to.

Well, I think that is it on the update front for right now.  Sorry about the lack of updates, I barely have time to sleep, let alone let you guys know about my sleep.

Peace and love to all who deserve it,

"event","Man, seeing the streets of Boston lined with police in friggin riot gear was just crazy.  It was quite the sight to see.  Although it was a waste of a trip, because they wouldnt let my 20 yr old girlfriend into Jillians.  We wound up going to to Nick's Comedy Stop, which was rather comical.  One of the funniest parts of the night was the comedian talking about when he was in jail, and one of the other prisoners would give blowjobs to guys for two cups of ramen noodles, but the comedian thought that the guy justed liked giving blowjobs, and he didn't want to seem like a slut, so he asked for soup to try to throw them off.

The other funny part of that was when he talked about joining the YMCA, and playing basketball with some guy, and the guy asked him if he was gonna take a shower, cause the other guy wanted to take one with him.  The comedian neglected his opponents proposition, and the guy said ""Your girlfriend will be mad if you go home smelling bad"" and the comedian comes back ""Maybe so, but she'll be pissed if I come home gay.""  The comedian wasn't mad that the other guy thought he was gay, he was mad because he thought he was easy.

I'm so happy that the Red Sox are beating the Yankees in this game (it's 3-1 right now) becaue my aunt apparently has tickets to Game 2 of the World Series assuming the Red Sox make it to the October Classic.

Y'all have a fantastic week.

Me, Scarface and 8-Ball are gonna go up to Peabody today (a course I haven't played yet) and I'm finally going to have something to let my aggression out.  

The Red Sox lost last night, but we need three games to go to the seven-game, winner-take-all series between the Marlins or the Cubs (or the Marlins) and the next three games are at Friendly Fenway.  Not to sound too cocky, but knowing the BoSox, they have a better then average chance.  Cowboy Up.

Saturday (tomorrow I think) I am going to Jillians with my girlfriend, Marina, her sister, Nat, her sisters finace, Mike, and Mikes college room mate Paul.  I have a feeling that this will turn bad cause Mike Paul and I love the Red Sox, and our girlfriends...don't.  Should be interesting.

"event","Red Sox leading series 1-0.  One game doesnt win a series, but it wins some confidence for the BoSox.  Keep it up boys.

Ramblin time.

Ed Hillel, you are not a MLB umpire, you are not even in the 21st century.  Chop the ponytail hippy, then we might listen to you.  What makes you a friggin expert about this shit?  Do you really think we take you seriously?  Go back to what you know...bong rips and burger flippin.  See you at the ballpark, asshole.

Russ Prodsay and Bob Horvth are some more sore losers.  ""The right field ump called it foul and he had the best view of the play. Isn't that why they have him out there?"" Yes Russ, he is, but guess what you ignorant donkey fucker.  The homeplate ump called it a homerun and he had the power to over rule the right field ump.  Isn't that why they have him in there?  Get over it.

Bill Mueller, David Ortiz Todd Walker and Kevin Millar are four guys that came into a team that loves and respects all the players, and not just blended in, but broke out as well.  Mr. Mueller, don't take that batting title lightly.  Look at the NL batting title winner, Albert Pujols, and just know that you are the AL's answer to him.   Feels good, doesn't it?

Byung Hung Kim you might as well pack up your bags.  Go back to Arizona to blow games or go back to Chinatown to blow some men, just get the fuck out of a Red Sox jersey.  What right do you have to come to Fenway Park and flip off the Fenway Faithful?  You must have balls the size of Godzilla you fucking cum thief.

Trot Nixon has always been one of my favorite Red Sox player, but this year has just been great.  Keep it up Trot.  Big things are in this guys future.  Maybe even a ring.

Derek Jeter, how I would love to see you go to a press meeting and bring up how Todd Walkers HR should have been foul.  Let's not forget back in 1996, during the ALCS when Mr. Jeter hit a ball into the outfield, seemingly within the reach of Baltimore Orioles outfield Tony Torasco, until some dumb fuckin kid named Jeffrey Maier grabbed the ball, thus giving Jeter the 4-bagger.

Joe Torre.  I was born to hate you, soley because you wear The Pinstripes, but I must admit, it takes a big man to go out to talk to the umps and pretty much say ""OK, you guys say it was a homerun, it was a homerun."" and walk back to the dugout.  Just leave that hat on, thats not a receding hair line, thats a mean joke from God.

It's good to see Manny Ramirez getting the hits.  I don't mean the homeruns either.  It's good to see them, but it is even better to see him actually running out his singles, instead of just getting out.

Theo Epstien and Grady Little probably go back to their hotel rooms, or houses every night and wonder what the fuck ""Cowboy Up"" means and where it came from, but if they didn't believe in the bellow, they wouldn't have shaved thier heads.  I tip my (cowboy) hat to you gentleman.  Bravo.

Hey Val...Cubs are going down.  Pudge Rodriguez is gonna lead the NL Wild Card Marlins to the Series against the AL Wild Card Red Sox, but Florida's success will end there.  Sorry Annie.  Didn't mean to yell at you.  Skippy...you rock.

Well, thats it!  I finally got my post up.  On my last two attempts, my computer shut off.

Signing off...a World Series bound Red Sox.

"event","Yea, so my 21st birthday was just over a week ago, and I would have had this update up here earlier, but I had to spend damn near a week recovering.  Quick little play-by-play for ya:
Me and my friends (Tommy and Andy) meet up and head to Boston.  Go Directly to Hooters.  Try to meet up with my girlfriends sisters fiance...doesn't happen.  Go to the game where they actually 12 Red Sox batters and the only Red Sox player that did not get walked was...Todd Walker.  It was good that Lady Irony could join me for my big day.  Fenway workers have the gall to charge me 5 bucks for water that looks slightly like beer.
After the game, meet with brother (Greg) cousin (Dann) and friend (Josh) at a BU bar, The Dugout.  Four shots and a 2 beers later have to run for the train.  Hilarity insues.  On the train home, some random girl asked us what train stop she needs to pick up the orange line and she was surprisingly willing to follow two kids that were 3 sheets to the wind and my not-so friendly-looking sober friend (designated driver), Tommy.

Saturday:
On four hours of sleep, wake up and meet Tommy and Andy again and head to Lowden N.H.  Stop at random gas station to get beer and down home punch (God bless New Hampshire) and meet some nice Hell's Angels.  I dont care what you say, Hells Angels are nice people.  They only fuck with you if you fuck with them.  They are just like anyone else, just don't piss them off.  Get to the Nascar races but...whats this?  We cant bring glass bottles in?  We should throw them out?  Why dont we just pound these 4 drinks that are almost completly hard liquer!  Start drinking at 11:30 a.m. that day, and dont stop drinking until we got kicked out of the club at 2 a.m. the next morning.

In those two drinks, I managed to consume 3 jello shots, a double shot of tequila, 3 massage shots, 3 buttery nipple shots, 2 grape crush(?) shots, 3 buttery nipple drinks, and at least 15 beers...and thats what I remember from it.  For a full account, you may contact Tommy Richer or Andy Willen.

As if that wasnt bad enough, I woke up early to go out to breakfast with my girlfriend, and then had to go do a detail for the wonderful city of Melrose, and all fuckin day long, I had to deal with shit eating kids (that was weird, I thought it was a figure of speech.....ew) yelling in my ear for 5 hours.  I'm never gonna have kids.

Well, thats it for now.  I still miss all my friends that left me here in Massachussets, but I also miss my friends that didn't leave me here, cause I have been so friggin busy, but that'll change.  Sometime.

Also, to further advance my career, I be fixin to move down south.  Not soon, but sometime. Hopefully.  Y'all (being my friends) will be the first to know.  

Aight, peace.

Lisa had a pretty cool party, with the only two exceptions: The kid who tried starting shit with me, and Lisas parents coming home with Lisa, Beth, Pat Behen and me sleeping in the living room.  It was quite a fun filled night.  To list some of the highlights:
Brendon German Suplexing Jen K. into the pool.
Me Tyler and Brendon forcing Rufus to drink.
Brendon skull f*cking Doug.
Brendon exclaiming ""This view is great, I can't see their faces!""
When asked if he wanted to funnel Andie replied ""Wait til Rachel  leaves"" ...with Rachel right behind him.
Skippy not being in the gate for a minute before being tossed in the pool by *surpirse surprise* resident asshole, Brendon.
Joe R.  He's just fun to be around, cause when we make fun of him, he doesnt know it!
Juans relentless attempts to get Clarrisa to flash him (not even subtle about it either).
Me getting home at 5:45 am, and not having house keys.

""Rivalries"" were put aside, and I couldnt be happier.  It was so great to see everyone like Dan, Steve, Tyler, Andie and all them.

Last friday was pretty crazy too.  It was great to see Retard Joe for the second time in about 2 years, and I cant wait to steal your bike.  It was also great when he almost threw everything up in Andies van.  Is it bad when you try to make someone feel better by telling them that you love them, and they start crying more than they were crying in the first place?  It's OK Rachel, I still like you.  Andie...straight Kaluha at 7:30 A.M. is probably pretty stupid, but it was pretty funny.The best part of the night was the Hitler mustache on the Jew.  Man, my friends are stupid, but funny.  Also, Steve pretending to be past out and us worrying, but him waking up and getting DANK'd was great.  I am pretty sure Anna was mad, but I'm not too good at reading girls.  All in all it was a great day, and it's also good to remember my live journal password.

In about two weeks I will be having my one year anniversary with my girlfriend, and that will be awesome, cause she is the best girl in the whole world, so that will be really really cool.

Doug thinks I'm kidding when I say that I will be at his house at 4:00 in the morning to go pick up the game...stupid fucking Doug.

Peace...

AJ

"event","Work sucks.  School sucks.  Life is so boring.  All I do is go to work and go to school.  My girlfriend is coming home this weekend, so that should be fun.  Other than that, the only thing this month that I have to look forward to is doing security on Halloween.  That'll be an adventure.  Oh, also Grand Theft Auto: Vice City comes out one week from tomorrow.  That will be the greatest game ever.  Drive-by's in Golf Carts.  Doug knows where I'm coming from.  Shut up Doug.  Well, thats all I've got.

Take care all,

"event","As you may or may not know, I would like to some day become a police officer.  I recently got my results for the Massachusetts State Police test and I got a 93%, where I needed at least an 80 to pass. Great day for me, as I finally have made my family proud.
Lots of thanks to my friends and family who believed in me from the beginning of this long and weird journey, and a very special thanks to all the assholes who doubted me from day one.  I couldn't have done it without all of you who said I would never amount to nothing...and you know who you are.

Brendon...if you are reading this, I'm sorry about the message I left on your answering machine.  Marina put me up to it, and I thought it was a great idea.  You know I got nothing but love for you...bitch.


Thanks again, and love to all...except Doug 'cause he's a douche bag."

"event","Hey what's up everyone?  Chances are that if you are reading this you already know me, and if you don't know me, you probably came here by accident, but I'll give an intro anyway.  My name is AJ, I am 20 years old and I live in Massachusetts.  I love it here...the hot as hell summers and colder then a witches tit winters, but I wouldn't change anything about it.  I have a girlfriend (Marina) who is the best girl in the world.  My friends (Brendon, Doug, Juan, Tyler, Val, Lisa, Christine...) who are cool but crazy.  Thats about me in a nut shell, and chances are, if you get hooked on my private life, you will come back to learn everything else that happens in my life.

"event","yesterday i got to see joel. i was so excited. i havent seen him in like 2 weeks. but before that like 2 months! anywho. i left after i got outta class at 3p, and i got there at like 5p. joel wasnt outta work yet, and he didnt end up getting back at his apt. until like 8! so me and his sis shawn hung out and watched movies. so when he got home, we watched finding nemo, and that got over at like 11p. then my mom calls and is all like where are you?(thinking i was driving home) im like at his apt. still. and shes like well when areyou coming home? and i say soon...unless i can stay the night!? and shes like WHAT? NO, YOU PLANNED THIS ALL ALONG! and more shit like that. and then shes like here talk to your dad. my dad was like well why dont you come home? and i say fine. cause you know i was asking if i could stay in the first place. and as he was hanging up, i hear my mom yell WHY DOES SHE MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE? 

today, we didnt talk. this is getting real old. and my dad tells me that we have to work this out, because she thinks that i hate her, and that i talk to dad, and my bro on purpose, and not her. ok, are we 5 years old again? and that i just have to be more open with her. because she is seeing this as my fault(which me and my dad know its not). and then my dad says its starting to make me depressed the way that she is crying all the time, and being miserable. 

WTF? i just wanna not be here ever again!"

"event","right. so i thought today would be so much fun. wrong... joel moved home and everything. him and his sis are pretty much moved into their apartment, and i was gonna go see them at like 5p. but i was being the nice, considerate daughter and waiting until my mom comes home. yeah, i should of just left. she starts yelling about how i wait till the last minute to ask her about anything, and that its too late to go there, and its gonna take 2.5 hours to get there, and ""how are you gonna see the street signs at night in the dark??""

are you kidding me? honestly, i think she thinks that ive never driven anywhere before. and also, he only lives like an hour away. this is such bullshit. you know, im sure that she wouldnt have a problem if i said i wanted to go see my sis at CMU. and thats 2.5 hours away. but im sure she wouldnt care then. i cant stand this shit anymore. tomorrowim just leaving after class at 3p, and not giving a shit. 

now here's what im thinking... i could just pack up some necessary shit, and just stay. seriously. that would be so much better. cause the whole situation with my mom is NOT gonna get any better. i know this for a fucking fact. we have not been alright for a long fucking time. and we have our little fights... well they're not really little but anyway... and then the next day shes like acting like nothings wrong, and my best friend. i dont know what the deal is, but nothings changing. i mean we've even talked about it, and still NOTHING!

i feel like its a lost cause. maybe far into the future we'll be fine, but now its like i make her cry everyday about shit like getting along with my dad, or not saying hi right away. i mean come on... chill out! 

ok i think im done now."

FUCK! i bet thats why my dad did that. son of a bitch... i dont have like any $$$ in my checking account anyways.. like $40!! i know i know thats so terrible. oh well. maybe i should just stop spending all my money.

my friend mandy's birthday is coming up on Oct. 16, and she is gonna be 19. so she wants me and a couple other chicks to go over to windsor in canada, and go to clubs and bars and then stay the night in a hotel. hmmm, thats not quite my style. we'd go on the 15th, then come home the next day. anyways, so i see her and my other friend tara at school yester, and they were like are you gonna go?! and im like i'll go, but i cant spend the night. and then she's all being like you gotta go, its your best friend's bday. but mandy was like no, its fine. UGH give me a break. whatever.."

"event","yeah, so i just made this thing! and my day today was quite dull. hmm, i went to school, then came home and made this thing. YAY! 
my mom came home and she only said hi how are you? thats the only thing she said to me since yesterday at about 5pm! WTF? yesterday i dont know what i did or said to make her just start crying like crazy. it was so weird. it could be about 2 reasons that i can think of right now....
1. i didnt take off some days at work to go to a CMU football game with the fam.
2. i hardly said anything to her yesterday, but said more things to my dad when he came home.
you know... i bet its both. whatever, and now shes upstairs talking about it all to someone on the phone."

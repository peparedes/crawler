No, not because I want one. I just want to name one sillies! I have picked out the most beautiful name for a child.

Supercalifragelisticexpealidocious Paradimethylaminobenzaldehyde Fehl

Beautiful, no? I will call him Cal for short.

I've also thought that with my last name, Fehl, which is pronouced like FAIL. It would be cool to name a boy:

Ignatius William Fehl, or I. Will Fehl

This moment of randomness was brought to you by the letters P & H, as in phat!

Oh by the way I named my kitten that I got Paris Hilton. Why? Well she's a kitten so she's kind of a bitch. She hates other cats, so she hates her own kind. She also loves people so I call her a slut. Perfect name! Also when I was having a beer not to long ago she wouldn't leave it alone and wanted it. Next thing I know she'll be taking my car out and getting a DUI.

"event","I miss you all terribly!

It has been almost 2 years since Celebration 3. It is now one of my fondest memories. I can still remember the drive to Indy with Brackett (aka Darth Danza) and watching the SW films on his in dash DVD. I remember the exhilaration of pulling into downtown Indy and thinking that I was going to the event I had so desperately wanted to go to the past two times. I thought it was going to be a fun few days of Star Wars geeking out.

Looking back the Star Wars stuff was unimportant. What was more fun was the people I was with. Many of them I now know are lifelong friends. The Star Wars stuff was just an excuse to get us together. We shared a common interest, but we found out that many of us shared more than just that common interest.

I smile every time I think about sitting in the line for the opening ceremonies. All these people I had only met in chat rooms and message boards were right there in front of me. It was a surreal moment. Blizz, who I had chatted with since 2000 was sitting right there taking pictures with her action figures (not to mention doing some weird other stuff with them ;)). Life was certainly good.

That week I had the pleasure to meet Brooke. I had seen her around the GS before but had never really chatted with her. Wouldn't you know it I spent more time hanging out with her than any other person there. We hit it off right away. I know if she lived closer we would still be hanging out a lot and goofing off together.

T'bone, another person I ran into on the GS back in 2000. Other than chatting in Jedinetwork every once in a while we didn't talk to much until Halo 2. We played that game so much. Lou doesn't know it but he saved me a lot of money by getting me addicted to that game. It kept me in more often than I used to. We even played the night before we were both leaving for C3, in fact I stayed up way too late because of it. He turned out to be just as good of a guy once I met him. I hope I have the pleasure of hanging out with him again. I can't wait til Halo 3 comes out so I can play some CTF with him.

Jim aka Fish I had met back in Jedinetwork days. I'm not sure how much he really remembered me, but we started chatting again before C3. That guy knew more about movies than anyone I had ever met and probably will ever meet. Maybe some day if my film stuff pans out we can work together on a film. I'm pretty sure it would be great.

Then there is the beautiful Scot, Flo! I didn't think it was possible for me to ""giggle"" but she made me. She is not only beautiful, but she's got a personality to boot! :P She unfortunately is in the same boat as me on not getting to go to C4, too bad I'm not in Scotland so we could sulk over a pint together.

Jeff aka Horse Head, yet another from Jedinetwork that I had wanted to meet for a while. His crazy photoshops always had me laughing back in the day. He was the guy in chat who wouldn't even mistreat the newbies, unless of course they were asking for it pretty bad. Him and his buddy Reggie have my gratitude forever for scoring us our C3 Vaders. He's also fun to drink some beer with I was really looking forward to partying with him at C4... :(

I think this might have to go into part 2 for everyone else.

I just wanted to let you know that you guys have helped create a memory I will never forget. I hope you all know that I care for you all and I hope some day we will all get to hang out together again...

Many others will be mentioned in Part 2. In fact I might say some more about these people too...who knows.

May the Force Be With You ;)"

I have started my new position at Circuit. I am now officially a home theater installer. It's one step above a cable guy. :P Oh well my boss is cool as shit and it's the same schedule every week. Hopefully it will give me more time to concentrate on my business once the rush is over.

The big news in my life right now is that Andrea finally knows how I truly feel about it. Don't think anything will come from it but I finally told her. Oh well if she doesn't go for it I think she is missing out on a great chance for a truly loving relationship.

There is a bigger story involved with it but I'm gonna get some sleep and talk about it later.

First, Work sucks a lot right now. It is one of the sources of my constant frustration. I'm tired of getting paid half as much as the managers do but expected to do the same shit they do and sell my ass off. It's not fair. That and half of the people don't do their share of the work. It just has me tired out.

Secondly, The thing with Brian has me VERY stressed out. For those of you who don't know Brian is my roommate. He signed a year lease that ends December 31, 2006. Well he decided earlier this year that he wants to go into the Air Force. That's good for him. I think he should've decided before he decided to sign a year lease with me and Jeff. Well he tells us he wants to move out this summer. Well he finally starts trying to move out his stuff the other day. I tell him that he has to continue paying rent since we can't find anyone to replace him and he is on the lease. He said he doesn't have to because of military leave, even though he doesn't leave til the end of October.

Well, he's refusing to pay and we have no one else to move it. I wouldn't mind as much if he had helped us find someone to take his place. He shouldn't however just think that he can leave us with his share of the rent. I'll take his ass to court over this. I have no problem doing this. Fucking immature asshole. Just because he is finacially irresponsible he is going to put his burden on us? It has me very pissed off.

Also, I have to buy a new car. I don't want to have to pay an extra $200/month in rent plus more utilities because of this douchebag. The new car is going to cost me enough as it is. In fact now I'm contemplating getting something cheap that is in good condition until I'm very finacially secure.

School is screwing me by not processing my loans quick enough so I'm going to have to pay out of pocket and wait to be reimburssed by the loan. So August is not going to be a good month for Blake apparently. :(

Andrea just called and told me she can't go on the float trip anymore. Which means I'm out of $60, because let's face it she won't pay me back. She never does. I'm just tired of being walked on by all these people....

Guys, I feel like I'm about to snap. I'm having trouble sleeping now because of everything going on. I'm worrying a lot lately. I'm just afraid that something else is going to happen and leave me struggling to make payments each month. I've never had that problem before and I don't want it.

I just don't know what to do. I want to hit something or scream!!

FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!"

"event","First a big <b>FUCK YOU</b> to the government. Why even though I haven't been claimed under my parents for almost 4 years now, and haven't lived with them for almost a year, why can't I apply for aid without them? FAFSA is out to fuck me over once again. I recieve no money from my parents but under FAFSA their income is still being taken into account until I am 24. So basically I might not be able to go back to school unless I figure out a way to get past this. I was really looking forward to going back...this sucks.

A big <b>FUCK YOU</b> to my roommate and the girl he is dating. She's quite a bitch and comes over here and is rude to me. She is condescending, rude, and just generally brainless. Example she managed to insult many things about me earlier tonight. I was hanging posters that I put in poster frames earlier today. One was Fellini's <i>8 1/2</i> another <i>The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</i>. She asked why I was doing it. I told her I was making the downstairs look nice and actually decorated. She asked if I have been watching decorating programs lately and inspired myself to do that. She also said it was gay. Then she went on about how she had never heard of any of the posters that I was going to put up. The movies were ""old"", so in her opinion that made them foolish and beneath her...

Although I shouldn't be suprised. The first night she came over she saw my dvd collection and asked ""Did you buy all of those?"". No, I have a magic midget in my closet that makes me dvds...

She also saw the book I was reading on my bed and asked ""You read?"" with a look of utter disdain on her face. My response of course was, ""You don't?"" although I can't say was really that suprised. Although when she said, ""I don't think I've read a whole book in my life."" it suprised me because I thought I heard a distict tone of pride in her voice. Could she actually be proud that she doesn't read? I don't think you have to read to be intelligent, but I think you have to have read a little to be...maybe that is presumptuous of me.

Well, tonight they came in when I was watching Smallville, which I think really isn't that great of a show, but I can't help but watch it because I'm a Superman geek. She immediatley declares my watching of the show stupid. While it is not the best show I enjoy it and hey, at least it isn't reality tv, correct? I ignore it and turn it off since I won't be able to watch it in silence since they are talking very loud over the tv. I'm a little ticked because  Jeff uses the downstairs every night. He can take her up to his room and let me have it every once in a while.

She later proceeded to talk about how bad Smallville show is, it is almost as bad as Buffy. That is when I said hold on. I watch Buffy too and it's a much better show. This is when my roommate jumps in and goes in on her side. Let me make something clear. Jeff, my roommate, has never watched an episode of Buffy so he has no ground to stand on. I doubt she had either, but she said she had seen an episode or two. I told them they shouldn't be so closed minded, if you could get past the whole vampire and demon thing and enjoyed it for what it was it was one of the best shows on television. They continue to trash it and say how it is for girls. At this point I'm just fed up. I throw the remote at Jeff and told him he can have it since I can't watch anything without it being ""gay"", ""girlie"", or ""stupid"". Also there was a fuck off in there somewhere after he asked what my problem was.

I'm just disappointed that he doesn't get why I am angry. I don't care if she trashes the stuff I like, because not everyone likes the same type of things. What I don't like is she makes assumptions of my character based on things I like, and looks down on me for it. I am not what I watch, or listen to. I am my own person and I am fun...which she has seen. She just chooses to be wrapped up on what people might think about her. I just wish she would take her closemindedness somewhere else...

I'm a lil frustrated right now. I took about an hour drive to clear my thoughts and I'm feeling a little better but I'm going to sleep bad tonight because of this bitch. I hate people coming into my house and being rude...

Fuck everything."

"event","Well it is that time of year again when boredem starts to turn into a never ending party. It's summer yet again. The beginning of summer also means another thing, graduations. Every year at this time I see stories of people at their graduations getting in trouble or being thrown out for ""being over exuberent"" or ""loud"". My thing with this is, so what?

<a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/ksat/20060606/lo_ksat/9326453"">Take this story for example.</a>

Kicked out for being excited about actually being allowed to graduate? Here's a little note to the faculty at schools like this. THIS IS NOT YOUR GRADUTION, IT IS YOUR STUDENTS! They are allowed to be excited about moving onto a new stage in their life. Showing emotion hurts no one, and in my opinion it makes for a hell of a better ceremony. By removing these kids all you are doing is ruining something that could've been a great memory for them. Most likely to you it won't mean anything 10 years down the road, but to them it is a memory they will never forget.

I just feel like we are training our children to be mindless drones that lack anything that makes us human. Not that I don't think it would be cool to be a robot. So let's put a rigid set of rules and standards on everything so there may be no more freethinking. Let's make our school system into one giant cookie cutter that puts out the same thing every year. Hey you over there, better not celebrate accomplishing something, because what would other people think???

<a href=""http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-grad04.html"">Here's another one</a>

Ok, so she was late (sort of, she arrived 2 minutes before the doors were supposed to be locked, but 53 minutes later than most of her classmates). I also hate it when people aren't punctual. I think it is selfish to make other people wait for you, when you have agreed upon a time. First though, let's start off by saying the girl was only 18, at that age you still have plenty of maturing to do. You can't expect high school kids to be perfect.

Once again to the faculty, it isn't your graduation, it is your students. Do not deny them something they most likely looked forward to since the day they stepped into your circle of hell. I understand you are bitter and we don't pay you enough, but please try to remember that you were young once and you made mistakes or were wound up with too much energy. Throwing a student in jail because they want to experience something all their friends are going to do, isn't the right thing to do.

Now I do believe there are times when you need to be calm and collected. You can't always let your emotions control you, but I don't think it should ever be forbidden. Why shouldn't we take joy in the fact that we feel like we do? Isn't this what sets us apart from all other types of animals (mind you dolphins are some cool fuckers :P). People just need to learn to use their judgement better. If it isn't hurting anyone, what is the harm?

Oh well, end of that lil rant. I really do have more to say but I'd require a book to do that.

Instead I will tell you of how I spent my weekend. Well folks it was filled with much beer. I went to my friend Nicole's graduation party. There was a keg and lots of cans of beer. I had way too much to drink. Luckily I had a designated driver. I had also had a few the night before at the Funny Bone. The comics there were mediocre at best, it explains why no one has really heard of them except people who are in the comedy circuit.

Sunday night I almost caught myself on fire during a bonfire with some friends. Suprisinly there was no drinking involved, which makes it even worse. Luckily I was not hurt and came away only with no hair on any of my toes. If your whole foot has never been engulfed in flames I suggest you try it, it is quite a rush.

I now have two days off and I am going biking later today and plan on finally getting my laundry done. I know I lead such an exciting life. Maybe I'll go up to Fox and the Hound later tonight and get my drink on. I can see if they have even ordered my new mug in yet....

As always thanks for listening."

"event","So one of my dreams might be coming true soon. I might be traveling to Australia this summer, for free no less! My dad got offered to speak at a conference down there and they would pay for him and one other person. My mom being the lovely lady that she is told my dad that he should take her, but me instead. My sisters have both traveled to somewhere out of the country before and I never have. So she thought it would be a good experience for me. Plus she thought I would appreciate it the most out of any of them. I've wanted to travel there for so long. Although I wanted to do a New Zealand/Australia trip, this will do fine though if I get to take it. It isn't for sure yet, but there is a good chance it will happen. It will be in December which means it will be summer there. 

What makes it even better is that my friend who I wanted to take a trip down there with might actually be able to come as long as he pays for his flight down there. He's like family anyways so my mom and dad said he should come. I am really hoping this happens, but I'm not giving my hopes up because things like this can fall through is what my dad said. So I'll keep my ears out til it happens.

On another note, a year ago today I was in Indy and the celebrations were about to start. I miss all you guys a lot. I'm hoping I get to actually meet up with you in person again sometime."

"event","Randomness is appreciated by few, but to those who do appreciate it, thank you. You are embracing uniqueness...and now for some random.

I am rolling over many thoughts lately. The whole situation with Danielle made me realize quite a few things.

First, why must people get so caught up in romance and think it is something out of 'The Notebook'? Not every romance is epic, and it isn't going to be picture perfect. So the first time there is one small hitch in how you think it should be going, don't freak out. People need to learn how to adapt. Not everything can be scripted and perfect. Everyone is to caught up in having things handed to them, and everything has to be perfect. Not everything is easy, and not everything will be perfect. When you set yourself up for perfect, you are doing nothing but setting yourself up for failure.

Secondly, why must people and try and make excuses for every mistake they make? Own up to your mistakes and take credit for being an ass. Everyone makes mistakes, if you insist on covering them up and making excuses don't expect me to treat you like an adult. I think a big sign of maturity is owning up to ones own mistakes. It is what you do after you own up to them that really shows if you are ready to deal with it the next time. If you ""man up"" and still try to make excuses for why it happened then you are still trying to pawn the blame on something besides yourself.

Some random sides about what has happened lately, some good and bad:

- I am getting a small raise at my job, even though I have only been back one month. Happy days...
- I am starting a new business enterprise with a friend. It is a t-shirt business. We plan on marketing a series of good shirts such as ""Emo Grass: It Cuts Itself!"" and geek shirts such as ""George Lucas Is My Homeboy"". It's just a lil thing to try and make some extra ""dolla bills"".
- The said enterprise is hopefully how I am going to fund my movie.
- I had an old teacher read my synopsis for my story and tell me that I had a great story and she can't wait to see what I do with it once I transfer it to a script.
- My car is still broken, although I'm hoping to get it back with in a week.
- I apparently know how to pick crazy people to date...
- My Netflix's queue is better than yours.
- After talking to Andrea a lot lately I realize I still have feelings for her, but I should stop them before they get out of control again.
- I know she is perfect for me, but so do 3 other guys.
- They are douchebags...
- No really they are
- I'm not kidding I'm pretty sure they have nametags that say so.........
- Despite the shit with Danielle I am in a generally good mood lately.
- Beer is good.

Yarr, I've been doing some thinking lately and it's getting close to a year since Celebration III. I was thinking of the great time I had last year and how  I don't talk to some of you guys that much right now. I really want to, but I have so little time on my hands. I'm trying to do so many things lately. Hopefully things will start slowing down soon.

Hmm, longer post than I have had lately."

The last post I mentioned something about Danielle, well we went on a date, things went well, actually they went real well.  In fact she just left my house about half an hour ago. I'm hoping things keep going pretty well. Sometimes she can be a lil bit of a girl and say something that irks me, but it happens.

The good news is that I am moving my computer up to my room next week, which means I can finally use it at my leisure (I think) as long as my roommate isn't always trying to go into my room to play City of Heroes. Hopefully I'll be able to talk to ya'll more soon. 

The bad news is that ever sine my car broke down at the Lakehouse three weeks ago, it hasn't been fixed yet. Stuff keeps happening to it...so once I get it fixed I might need to trade it in and get a new car. At the moment I'm looking at Jeeps, but I don't know if I can afford the one I want. I need to get promoted at my job soon so I can afford a decent car...but that won't happen.

Although being back at Circuit City is great, it is even more laid back than it was when I left. And I've come back real strong so I've made a good impression on the new Store Director. Hopefully he'll tell the new DM that I am a worthy canidate for any open Sales Manager positions. It could jump my pay up about $15,000 a year...."

So I just close the windows instead. Hopefully once I get a desk for my room I can move the computer up into my room.

Although my buddy just bought City of Heroes and put it on my computer and he's playing it all the time, which means I may never get computer back....:)

Oh well I go for a interview at Circuit tommorow. The thing about Circuit, is if I get moved to management there I will be making close to $40,000 a year, which would be a nice improvement over what I am making right now. So wish me luck there. I'm sure I can get my job back there. I just want to make sure they can give me more oppurtunity this time around.

I'm so frustrated with things that are happening at Target right now. My ETL is an idiot and my specialist smokes crack...or at least I hope he does so he has an excuse for being that stupid. Oh well....

I'm in talks with my friend Eric about coming back to Circuit. It all hinges upon the deal on if he can get me my wage I am paid now. That and if he can guaruntee me 40 hours a week. If he can I believe I will be putting my two weeks into Circuit. I still have a decent amount of friends there and I get along better with them than almost everyone at Target.

"event","The funeral was this morning at 11. It was a beautiful service. The preacher made it a very personal message and while it was sad it was a message of hope. There can always be hope. Dave always thought there was when he was sick, so now we have to hope that he is in a better place.

My sister is still taking it very hard. Yesterday at the visitation she cried most of the time, but got better as every hour passed until the very end when they said it was time to leave. She wouldn't leave his side and refused to believe he was dead. :( This morning at the service there was more crying, but I think it gave her a better sense of closure than anything else has. I don't think I saw her cry at all during the lunch after the service. Then once we went back to Dave's family's house she was much better. I think all the support she is receiving from everyone has helped her a lot. She is the one taking it the hardest. 

This isn't supposed to happen! He only just turned 26, he's supposed to have more years. My sister is only 23, she isn't supposed to have had to lose someone so close already. I don't care what anyone says, this will change her forever, now all her friends and family have to see her through this period so she comes out stronger instead of bitter and downtrodden. The whole thing is just severely depressing.

Dave's family has been very good to her, in fact they were estastic when Dave proposed to her over a year ago. They were hoping Leah would be the one to shape him up since she had a good head on her shoulders. She worked with him and he got better, he was still stubborn and bullheaded, but he loved my sister and she loved him so much. I should've seen this earlier and been a little more supportive. Luckily earlier this year me and him started to get along much better. Although I was told he always liked me. I just didn't like him because of his habits. 

He had a lot of friends and left a lot of them behind. He will be missed.

"event","So, this might be a little long or not, it really depends on how much I feel like reading. So if it gets too long let me apologize in advance.

The biggest peice of news that happened while I was away was that my sister's fiancee took a turn for the worse in his battle with cancer, they really aren't sure if he is going to make it to the new year. Although each week that goes by his chances get better for a little longer life. A couple weeks ago they were saying days to weeks, then it went to weeks to up to a year, after that it went back to trying to keep him alive til Christmas. Now we won't find out anything new til the 27th. He actually seems like he is doing a little better, he is still retaining water and such, but not to the point he was in his last chemo.

My sister isn't taking it too well, which is understandable. It's really hard to cope with something like that when someone is dying that you want to spend your whole life with, the fact that he is so young makes it that much harder. I hope she makes it through this all ok.

My second big news is the leasing of the townhouse that I am in. It's a 3 story (w/ a basement also) townhouse, it has 4 bedrooms and is about 1500 sq. ft. It is just my two buddies, Jeff and Brian, and me. We are just about all moved in now. In fact we went shopping today and spent almost $400 on groceries. We are just making sure we have everything we need. The only bad thing is because of this I don't have much extra money to buy my family that nice of Christmas gifts, but I'm sure they will understand. 

It doesn't really feel like home yet, but it will. I've only been here about half a week so far. I'm just ready to get it looking a little more lived in. There is nothing on the walls yet, so it probably looks a little boring, but overall it's looking good, and getting better every day.

My job at Target is going ok. I like some aspects but for most part the job bores me to death. That and the fact that the Exec Team Lead of hardlines is a really bad micro-manager. She isn't very good at letting us team leads take control of a situation and it feels like whenever something bad happens it is your fault, but when something goes good its because of her. It's just a little annoying but shit like this happens. I'll just have to cope with it. The good thing is that work and home now are only a mile apart so work doesn't take long to get to at all. I'm set with all that.

Love life is about where I left it. Nothing really going on. I have a few oppurtunities, but none of them are really ones that I want to take up. They just aren't my type, and by my type I mean a supermodel...ok, not really. I'm just trying not to settle on someone who I know isn't going to make me happy. The girls I tend to like probably feel the same way about me. :P

I had a couple fights with family members while staying at my grandparents, they treat my mom like crap and take advantage of her generosity a lot, and I stood up for them since my mom doesn't say anything. Stupid people like them are why my mom feels like crap a lot of time. She is the most generous person I know. She gives so much to that family but they never repay her back in any way and I'm sick of it. So I told them so, but they are so selfish that they can't see what is right in their face. That whole side of the family is just worthless. They are like sulky children who have to have everything their way.

Example we let my cousin Brittany borrow my leather couches earlier this year until I got a place of my own. I tell her last month that I will be needing them again soon, she just nods kind of in a pissy way. Well it comes time to pick them up and she says she needs them and I couldn't have them  back yet. I asked her what I was supposed to do at my townhouse for seating, she told me to tell people to sit on the floor. She had the nerve to try and deny me my own property because she thought she needed it more. She had it sitting in an unfinished basement and let her kids play on it, it wasn't that important to her. She knew all along that I would need it back. She's just kind of a bitch, even the other stupid family members think so...such a loving family. Oh well at least my dad's side is mostly alright.

"event","Well I got the job. I have to go do a drug test Saturday. So yea that's good, but the bad thing is I got hired at a different store than the one I know a bunch of people at. Oh well the way I figure it is once I move into an apartment I might be able to convince me to transfer to a different store. Plus the store I'm working at has the girl who interviewed me who was cute as hell. Apparently there are a lot of girls like that at the store I will be working at.

The other bad thing is that I talked to them about my payrate at the other store, but not at the St. Peters store. So I'm hoping I can still get the money I asked for. If not I will be going back to Circuit City and just go ahead and try the management program there.

Oh well at least I know I'll be starting to work again in about a week or so.

The first two I got perfect scores on because I saw the sheet in front of me. So that bodes well for me. The only problem was the last interviewer was kind of a bitch and put me off. I still gave good answers but she wasn't very friendly or anything. 

Although the first two girls who interviewed me were pretty attractive. The first one said that if the Chesterfield location doesn't hire me she said she could probably get the St. Peters location to hire me. I think she liked me. :P

The job starts at $10/hour but they said they would give me $11 if I passed my district interviews since my old job is offering me $10.75 to come back. So luckily if this falls through I still have a job I can go to.

It looks like I will be getting an apartment in December with Fat Kid. Which means I will be staying at my grandparents for a little while, and most likely without a computer and internet, but oh well that means I will get a lot of reading done. I might be able to connect on dial up if I get a computer, but I'll check in from time to time.

I don't leave to go to the grandparents for another couple weeks. So I'm online til then. Fun stuff."

"event","I'm just so frustrated at everything right now. I just don't know where I want go or what I want to do. Well actually I do know where I want to go, but I can't because the government won't give me student loans. I just...feel lost. I honestly don't know which way I want to go.

St. Louis - All my friends are around this area. Although my 2 best friends are away at college. So its not like I'd get to see them very much. The rest of my friends here are ones that I like to hang out with, but they tend to get a little old after a while because all they want to do is drink and party. Don't get me wrong I like to do that too every once in a while, but it gets old when you do it every friggen night.

There's also the issue of finding an apartment. I can't afford one on my own, so I'd have to share an apartment with someone. Yet none of my friends who want to move out of their parents house are people I'd want to move in with. 

New Orleans - I was excited a couple weeks ago that I was going to move down there, but now I'm not so sure I want to. It's not because of the hurricanes. It's because I'm not sure that is where I want to be. I'm kind of tired living under the same roof as my parents. It just feels so constricting. They don't really care if I leave or not, but I do get lectures when I come home at 4am in the morning sometimes. It'd probably better for all of us if I just moved out.

There's also the fact that I can't move down there now til at least another couple months...

Ohh another thing that sucks about getting an apartment is that I would have to sign most likely a year lease, which I cannot do probably since I'm GOING to find a way to go back to school next year. So that means my lease wouldn't be up by the time I would need to go back to school.

Katrina has seriously thrown a wrench into my plans. When I was down there I was making some good plans. The future was starting to look a little brighter, but now its gone dark again. All because mother nature decided to screw with us...

I'm also severly bored since I'm not going outside of the house much until my poison ivy starts clearing up a little more. So I have nothing to do really but sit my ass down in front of the computer and look for stuff to do, but it gets boring pretty quick. I wish I had someone in St. Louis that I could actually talk to. There's no one in town right now that I would really be able to talk to about stuff because the friends that I have left here are more worried about themselves than anything else. Maybe I'll call Andrea tonight and talk with her. Its just not the same over the phone. It's better when me and her can sit together and talk....

Oh well...I guess the post Katrina depression is finally starting to hit me."

I couldn't help but think about him the other day, because he was one of the chaperones at the youth gathering that I went on back in 2001 in New Orleans. I remember walking to the Superdome every day that week and 35,000 youths being there with me. It was great time. It's sad that they might not be able to hold it there agian for a while.

Thinking about that made me think of Andrea. That was the trip I should've taken the chance and tried my hand at trying to get a date with her. We were so close to it there I could feel it. We spent so much time together and it didn't feel like we were just friends. Although I stumbled and didn't take the oppurtunity and I still regret it to this day. Although if it is meant to be I think something with change. Maybe the winds will blow me the right way this next time and something will happen. I could really do with some Felix Felcis...

I'll be doing Open Mic I think this Tuesday if my poison ivy has cleared up by then. Although I have a feeling it won't be so I might have to call in cancel. It's a shame I wanted to try out some new material...

Well, yea. I'm so lost on what to do right now guys. I don't know if I should get a job here in St. Louis now and get an apartment, or try my best to wait it out until I can get back to New Orleans area. Most likely our house will be done late October or at the latest late November. I just don't know if I can wait that long. I'm down to almost no money. 

Maybe I'll see if I can't get a couple paying comedy gigs here to give me some extra cash."

"event","Ok it's gone far enough. I'm tired of it.

I'm tired of all the finger pointing going on in the media. Everyone wants to blame somebody else for what is going on in the media. It's getting a little old. I'm also tired of seeing Bush being blamed for the stuff that isn't something he did. I have no problem with bitching about him because I am too, but at least do it for the right stuff.

There is plenty of blame to go around. It starts with just about every local, state, and federal official that has had anything to do with this. There are things that have been done that has only made the situation worse. Yet all I see on the tv is politicians and FEMA workers kissing each others asses and saying what a good job they are doing. YOU ARE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB!

Now if you are wondering why other people need blame placed on them besides Bush, let me give you a few reasons:

Ray Nagin - I'm sure you have all see him bitch and moan about Blanco and Bush on the news. Yet, where was his foresight in the manner? I'm actually appalled that they made all these people go to the Superdome, yet they don't have any stockpiles or anything of freshwater. I thought that would be common sense. Also many of you weren't in the New Orleans area watching the first news conference before the hurricane. Him and other officials including Blanco spent NO LESS than 30 minutes kissing each others asses before they called for a recommended evacuation. 

Also, Nagin could have ordered for many school buses that weren't being used to ship many of these people to shelters.

Kathleen Blanco - I hear so many people bitching about the levee's in New Orleans and how Bush cut funding to them and such. First of all the levee's are state funded projects, not federal funded. Now the Corps of Engineers do work on them and they are federally funded, but unfortunately they have been being cut long before Bush. 

Blanco is not a smart woman to begin with. I make that statement from some other statements she has made in the past year. In fact she almost drove out the film industry earlier this year because she wanted to lift the tax breaks which brought them there in the first place. She thought the tax breaks were making them lose money. Yet what she doesn't understand is that THAT MONEY WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE if it weren't for the tax breaks. Not to mention the jobs it creates and the amount the spend on building sets and such. It's really ludicrous...

At least she isn't all smiles like another LA politician, which brings me to...

Mary Landrieu - Has anyone seen her on tv? She doesn't want to talk about what is going on she just wants to ass kiss. I clapped when Anderson Cooper went off on her the other day for doing that while there were so many people who still were in dire need of help. Yet she just shrugged it off and kept smiling. If I hear that bitch say one more time ""There will be a time to discuss the problems later..."" NOW IS THE TIME BITCH! This is why people don't like politicians. They try to spin everything and tip toe past the real issues.

Bush - Now yes I do have problems with him too. I honestly believe he should recall some of our National Guard from Iraq to reinforce the numbers in New Orleans. The only problem with this is that it would probably take a month at least, and that just isn't quick enough. Bush does need to stand up and make sure this aid gets to people quicker and bring down fire and brimstone when something isn't done right. Publically admonish a couple high ranking people who are fucking up and you bet they'll move their ass a little quicker.

FEMA Director Michael Brown - I don't believe for one second that this fucker didn't know that there were people at the convention center. He just wanted to not be lambasted for ignorning a dire situation. FEMA was supposedly prepared for this exact situation, yet they dropped the ball when it finally came to. A little while ago in partnership with LSU, FEMA did a test called Hurricane Pam, which was basically the situation we are going through now. Apparently they just wasted tax dollars and didn't learn a damn thing from it.

The whole sight is just frustrating and it has made me lose even more faith in our elected officials.

Now I know since I have said that Bush has been getting the worst of it and taking some of his side I'm sure I'll get branded an idiot red stater with too conservative views. Actually I consider my self an independent because I am more of a centrist. I lack faith in either party, and I'm not sure anyone would be prepared to handle this situation going on.

There is one thing I can say for all these people is that this is the first time something of this magniture has hit the United States like has. Remember hindsight is always 20/20. We can all sit here and bitch in front of our keyboards, but it is something completely different to be there actually doing it. So while I might say a lot of things on here that are harsh, you must remember one thing. I do it out of frustration, but I realize that I might do no better in that situation.

Let's just hope things start taking a turn for the better.

On another note, my father is most likely going to start doing some FEMA work next month to start helping with the cleanup. He is a civil engineer and worked with the Army Corps of Engineers for over 25 years before going to the private sector. He's hoping to lend some of his expertise to the situation since he is an expert on locks, dams, and levees.

EDIT: After I posted this I see that Bush is indeed withdrawing some troops from Iraq and Afghanistan to help with the crisis. So at least there is some good news...we just have to see how long it will take to get them here."

"event","I'm having a streak of bad luck right now...

Cleaning off the McIntyre's driveway during the storm so I could get my car into the garage I must've picked up some poision ivy (or oak or sumac dunno which). So I am itchy all over and I have Calamine lotion all over my face, but my eye is starting swell and become very uncomfortable. This sucks. :(

Ohh, and more bad news on the Katrina front. My dad found out that his office and our apartment are in one of the lowest areas of New Orleans so it looks like our apartment may be flooded even though its on the second level. Oh well at least we have insurance.

The whole situation down there is making me sick to my stomach. How can people be so horrible? It is total anarachy down there and it seems like there is nothing emergency workers can do about it. If things don't start looking up soon I have a feeling they are going to have a shoot to kill policy on looters. I can get looters getting food and such, but stealing generators from hospitals, food from nursing homes, and things like that just makes me sick. Situations like this bring out the best in some, while the worst in others. I'm just so ready for this to be all over with, but I have a feeling it won't be for a while."

"event","Alright, so I've had an interesting week. After living in New Orleans for less than a week I had to evacuate. It seemed that it was just my luck that this happened. There had been a series of unfortunate events throughout the week. I'll start witht he first major event.

Well the day before we had to evacuate (Friday) my dad's car was broken into. It was torn apart. He drove a 98 Olds Aurora and apparently someone wanted it even with the fucked up front end and hail damage. They tore out most of the stuff in the dash, knocked out the glovebox so it was in the backseat, and ripped out much of the electric (including in the steering column). Needless to say the car was fucked. It was totalled out last year because of hail damage. So my dad gets nothing for the car.

Saturday my dad takes my car out and we notice that it is starting to develop a flat tire. I have nice racing rims and low profile tires so this happens quite often, but since we were going to evacuate in the morning this wasn't very good news. We kept filling it up with air since it was a small leak hoping it would get us out ok.

We went to bed with Katrina rating a Category 3 and we were planning to leave the next morning. What we saw when we woke up in the morning strengthened our resolve. Katrina had been upgrated to a Category 5 overnight and recorded some of the highest gusts ever on record. Not to mention it was one of the largest hurricanes ever seen it terms of area. So we tried to go to 8'o Clock early service, but the pastor was smarter than my dad and decided to leave the day before. So we left across the causeway across Lake Pontchartrain causeway (which may be destroyed I haven't heard yet). Needless to say the waves were much choppier than they had been all week. 

Contraflow was in effect, which is where they turn all the highways one way so that people can evacuate faster. This worked pretty well up until we got to McComb, MS. About 20 miles ahead they converged the traffic and it was congested. We made it up past the Big Black River about 7 miles south of Vicksburg when my tire decided to go flat. Luckily we had lived in Vicksburg for 8 years and that was where we were going to stay with friends. They came and picked us up and a tow truck took my car since I don't have a spare at the moment. Well we made it to the McIntyre's house and started to watch the devistation that was about to unfold.

Yesterday at about 4:30 the power went out on us and we had nothing to but sit and watch the storm around us. When they hit Vicksburg the winds were still at Category 1 power, which is much more than that area is suited for. In coastal areas they tend to have some precautions for it, but Vicksburg was unprepared so the whole county was without power by the end of the night. Which isn't that many people, but that is 50,000 people alone. That was pretty far north also, so I only wondered what had been done further south.

We went outside this morning to survey the damage. There were trees everywhere. Limbs littered everywhere most of the roads in the south right now are not driveable. It's a really sobering scene. If that was what happened there, I shuddered to think what New Orleans was like. We we had a portable tv and it showed us just what it was like. As if the water and wind weren't bad enough you have the looting. This morning after hearing the levees were starting to break my dad and me headed back up to St. Louis until they will let us back into New Orleans which they say could take a month or two. 

We were living in an apartment in Metairie which is about 6 miles west of New Orleans. It lies right on the Pontchartrain. We are pretty sure the apartment complex we were in was flooded. So I'm estimating a couple thousand dollars worth of my stuff has been destroyed. Although that's better than me dead, and we did have renters insurance. What I am more worried about is our house that we are building up in Covington. Apparently some of the stuff has been flattened up there and I'm wondering if our house has. We'll probably find out sometime later this week.

And to think I was supposed to have a 3rd interview for a management position at Target down there on Monday. I don't think that will be happening anytime soon unfortunately.

I don't know what I will be doing next. I don't know if I will try to find a job in St. Louis for the time being and stay up here the rest of the year in an apartment once we close our house at the end of the month. Only time will tell.

"event","So a summary of the events of the weekend is in order I guess.

Well we started off for Kansas City about 11am. It was just Chris and me, as we were not able to find any replacements. The car ride was pretty uneventful. We played with a little toy called ""20 Questions"". It was able to guess most of the stuff we gave it, even stuff that was quite random. About halfway there Chris told me the forecast called for rain the wholeday in Kansas City. I wish he would've said something earlier because I could've brought an umbrella and poncho from home for the concert, but alas I did not. A little outside of Kansas City it started raining so hard that we couldn't see the road. Luckily we were right by an exit ramp when this started and we got off right away. We made our way to Cracker Barrel but we sat in the car and waited til it slowed down a little before we left the car to go inside. We still got thourghly soaked. We enjoyed a nice pancake dinner and set off for City Market.

Well, the directions to City Market were the most confusing set of directions I have ever read. You have to get off at 6 different exits, one right after the other. So of course we got lost. We ended up in a bad part of Kansas City, but from what I've seen of Kansas City on previous occasions it wasn't that hard of a task to do. After driving around a bit (it was still raining too) we managed to find City Market. Luckily we were also able to sell the extra tickets to some people there. It was pretty nice.

We met up with Chris's friend from school, Jewel and her friend Lindsay some where around 5:30 or so. Both of them were cuties. Lindsay was my age also and she went to school in St. Louis. She had good taste in music but overall she was kind of quiet. Jewel however was very cool. She and I had very similar interests. So we got along good and joked around great with each other. If I wasn't moving in about a week I'd be asking her on a date. I made some other friends in the line, they enjoyed my weird brand of humor. It was all good.

Well here's what wasn't ""all good"". Gates were supposed to open at 6:30. When that didn't happen people started getting restless and cutting in line. A ticket taker came out at about 6:50 and said that they would start admitting people in at 7:15. Well 7:15 came and passed. It was about 8:45 before they finally let us in. It was a hell of a wait because we were probably the first 100 people in line at first. By the time they let us in so many people had cut ahead of us we were about a 1000 people back. Our whole group was pretty pissed but at the same time pretty happy about finally getting in to see the concert.

We arrived in and waited for a little while, while the roadies did their soundcheck thing. I was a little suprised to see the first performer was Rufus instead of Ben Lee, who apparently they cut his whole set for the night. It didn't irk me too bad I really wanted to see Ben Folds the most. So as long as he played I was good. Rufus did a really good job. It was a much shorter set than what I saw him play last time. Although people who hadn't heard him before were amazed at his voice. He's real fun too I can tell.

Once that was done Ben came out. OH.MY.GOD. This man is a music god. I loved every minute of it. The first couple songs were rough because he broke a piano string. After three songs they finally took it out. He went on to play the longest set list he has played this year. 22 songs! That's friggen awesome. He really paid back the crowd that waited hours in the rain to see him play. So here's the set list:

In Between Days - This song was a little rough due to the string breakage which made some of the other chords sound off key. That and Ben couldn't hear himself apparently.
Bastard - This one plays a lot better than it does on the album. That I am grateful for.
Gone - This one we got a Pirate joke after. It was pretty funny.
Zak and Sara - This one has always been one of my favorites. Now I've gotten to hear it with just him playing, and now with a full band. Both sound amazing.
Jesusland - Another one off the new album. It's not bad, but he has better stuff.
All U Can Eat - This is on one of his EPs from last year. He should've put it on the album and left one of the other songs off. This is one of the best things to come from him. I love it. I was excited when he started in on it.
Still Fighting It - Off of ""Rockin' the Suburbs"" one of his more mellow tunes. The whole crowd was singing though.
Careless Whisper (with Rufus) - This is when it really started to get good. Rufus came out and sang the woman's part. It's all done in fun. I saw them do this last year in St. Louis. It's a highlight even if it is kind of a weird song to play.
Landed - I'm sorry but I'm not a big fan of Landed. The beginning sounds too much like the opening of Philosophy.
Bitches Ain't Shit - FREAKIN' GREAT! Gangsta Ben came out. It was hysterical. Seing a nerdy white guy sing Bitches Ain't Shit by Dr. Dre on the piano. Then his Aussie drummer did a part of the rap too. I was cracking up. Oh and I was rapping too. Download Bens cover on iTunes you will be glad you did.

Solo set
Brick - I didn't get to hear this in St. Louis last year so I'm glad he played it this time. It's his biggest hit.
Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head - He did this of course because it was raining.
Army - This is a fun song live because Ben splits the audience in half and does a two part horn section. That and the song is a great song to begin with.
Emaline - I love his live version of this much better than the Five's album version. It sounds much more personal live.
The Luckiest - People request this every show. Its a good song but they need to start requesting things like Underground which got moved off the set list because someone requested it. :(

You To Thank - AWESOME!
Gracie (Rock Version) - I heard him do this song live before it was ever released last year. It was just him and his piano. This time it was a rock version of the song. It did rock. The bass was heavy and so were the drums. Nice to see it holds up as a good song either way. Very sweet song about his daughter too.
Rockin' The Suburbs - w00t! I got to see it live. Complete with Ben beatboxing and drumming on the mic. He also picked up a base at the end and played the end of it on bass. It was great. That and thousands of people screaming ""FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK"" is always fun.
Philosophy - This is my favorite song ever by him. The melody of it stays in your head all day and the lyrics make total sense. The very end of the song where he had a rock piano solo is real fun too. This is one of the songs where he shows you just how good he is.
One Angry Dwarf (and 200 solemn faces) - You better watch out because he's big and important One Angry Dwarf. 
Thank You, Kansas City  - A little freestyle song thanking Kansas City fans. Oh this is also when he threw his piano seat at his piano from about 20 feet away. He hit it dead on making a loud noise. It's one of his trademarks.

Encore:
Not The Same - This has a three part choir thing in the real song but Ben uses the crowd for it in shows. It sounds real pretty. Although this time he got up on his piano and directed us. Then he made his own melody by directing us by telling us when to cut off. It was a great ending to a great show. 

The show did have it detractions though. We were sandwiched in and people kept on pushing their way in front of us and then just stopping right in front of us. That and we had weirdness all around us. We had a couple who I think were trying their very best to conceive a baby at this concert. We also had a young gay emo guy couple making out during half of the concert before one of them puked on the other. Then we had the stoner crowd right next to us. They lit up a lit of fatties and towards the end they got really loud and annoying. Although it will just make it more memorable.

Sorry for such a long post, but I had to get it out. If some of it doesn't make sense its because I'm still tired out from it."

"event","So I got some suckage news today. The cough that I heard Andrea have the other night has gotten worse. She isn't going to be able to go to Ben Folds tommorow because she is running a high fever and her cough is bad. So that is the major suckage. So originally this trip started out as 4 friends, but now its just me and Steiny. Which isn't too bad he is my best friend after all. Although we are both calling people to see if anyone wants the extra tickets and drive with us there.

Oh well. Suckage."

"event","So last night was Fat Kid's birthday so we all went over to Jeff's and threw Fatty K a party. It was real good because Jeff has a nice house. He has a nice spacious deck over looking a pool and hottub. The fact that it felt good outside last night made it just that more perfect. I drank a little more than I probably should so I ended up crashing at Jeff's so I didn't have to drive home. While I was there I realized how much I am going to miss some of the people that were there. Hopefully I stay in touch with them.

So this weekend is the Ben Folds concert. Apparently Eric can't go anymore which sucks on so many levels. I was really looking forward to him going to Ben Folds. He's slightly pissed he can't go too because he's been looking forward to this for about the past 3 months. Luckily Steiny and Andrea are both going. My two best friends at the concert with me is going to be amazing. Although right now the Andrea front isn't looking to hot. Oh well I'm really suprised that I'm not really all that hurt over it. I figure if it was meant to be it will happen. I figure I have enough desireable assets that I can get another girl. I'll find someone eventually.

The weekend after Ben Folds I'm gonna go down to New Orleans. I need to start looking for a job since I can't go to school. Its also a good idea to do this since I'm starting to run a little lower on money than I would like. I'm gonna stop by and see Jeremy again. We'll see what Starkville is like on the weekends during the school year. It will be nice to be a little closer to him. Although he is my closet friend to New Orleans and he is still like 4 or 5 hours away.

I might be going out later tonight I haven't decided yet. I'm still a little tired from last night so I might end up just staying home. Don't want to really spend any money. Tommorow though I might go see a movie or something. I've been wanting to check out Sky High. Maybe I'll do it tommorow."

"event","Last night I realized a couple good things about moving down to New Orleans.

First one is that Brookie is coming down this fall. Hopefully I will be there. I don't think my family will be going back up for Thanksgiving. So I should be down in N.O. at that time.

Second, I get to go to the Voodoo Music Festival 2005! There are a bunch of bands that I want to see there. To list some of the:

Foo Fighters
Flaming Lips
Queens of the Stone Age
Social Distortion
Cake
Ryan Adams
The Decemberists
Death From Above 1979
Billy Idol
and many others...

It's going to be pretty pimp. I'm hoping that one of my buddies will be coming down to see it with me. If not I have a couple friends in Mississippi that might go. Jeremy has never been to a real concert, so he might like a weekend festival. That way he can say he has seen tons of bands. I can't wait til they release the schedule and I can see which bands play when. Hopefully most of the stuff I like doesn't conflict with each other.

Oh well..."

"event","I'm so depressed right now...sorry to go all emo on you guys.

Well I got word today that I could get all the loans I need. Here in lies the problem though. Only about $2000 of them are in my name, the rest of them are in my parents name. My parents are in on situation to take on anymore loans at the moment. Which basically leaves me SOL. So basically I qualified for $35,000 in loans (which is what I need a year) but the majority of it is in Federal Loans PLUS. Which is parent loans which you have to start paying on right away. I got about $2000 of Stafford loans which I wouldn't have to pay back until after school. My parents are doing the best with money right now. Buying a new house and all can effect that. I destoryed my chances of them being able to help me by basically not manning up and going to school straight after high school.

I could get private loans, but um, yea I have no credit so they'd go in my parents name also. So whichever way I look I am screwed. I will most likely not be going to school this semester. Yet another failed portion of my life right now. I'm convinced that I will be a bum the rest of my life.

I think what makes me the most frustrated is that the goverment will let me file my taxes as an independent but not my FAFSA which makes all my loans go into my parents name. The government won't even let me be independent. So basically I have to wait until I can answer NO to one of the damn 12 questions they give me on the FAFSA I am fucked.

The worst part is I really just want someone to talk with about it face to face, but both my best friends are busy right now. Andrea is at work and Chris is with his girlfriend. I just want someone to talk to, to help me vent my emotions right now. I feel helpless and lost in the whole situation. I'm beginning to think I will never get to go to school. I don't want to feel like it is my fault for picking a school that is kind of expensive to go to, because that is stupid. Why should I feel guilty for choosing a school that will help me on my way. So many people suggest community college, but I'd rather not go through high school all over again. Community college doesn't offer a Film/Video program anyways. I tried going to community college right after I got out of high school back in 2002, but it wasn't for me. The classes were way to easy and they didn't focus on what I wanted to do. At Columbia College I will have programs tailored towards my major. 

Guys, sorry for all the bitching lately. I'm just so lost right now. I'm frustrated with myself and everything happening with it. I think I have some great ideas and I'd like to be able to do what I want with them, but I feel I should be educated about film before I do it. Otherwise I'll just be another amateur trying to keep his head above water.

GAHHHH! 

I don't know what to do. I know when if I go to New Orleans I'll only be thinking of what I'm missing at school again this year. A lot of my friends will be graduating this year. I feel like I'll be left behind while they move onto bigger and better things.

Every day I feel like I am just wasting another peice of my life...."

Ok, set up. 

My sister comes home one day and ask my mom, ""Hey can Liz stay with us a couple days? She is fighting with her aunt and uncle."" My mom being nice said yes. Well Liz then proceded to burn the bridges that she had created with her aunt and uncle and now they are not speaking to each other. Why you ask? Because she's a bitch. She wrecked on of their cars and she doesn't want to pay a small rent to live in their house now that she is 18. So instead she decides she will mooch off of my family. I don't mind this so much, but if you fucking impose on another family at least help out.

So we were trying to sell the house. Does Liz help out when needed to get the house cleaned up whenever we were supposed to show it? No, she sits her fat ass down at the tv or computer and watches us fucking clean up the house. This is when both me and my mother realize what a stupid little bitch this girl is. I can totally see why her aunt and uncle wanted her to pay rent...

So other things that are starting to irk me. She and her fucking boyfriend come and take over the downstairs at night. If I am watching something on the tv down there they will put in a dvd without asking me. They will tell me they are and they think that is alright. I snapped on them the last time they did it and I said ""This is my house, not yours you can wait until I am done."" Apparently she feels entitled to stuff in the house too, even though she is just mooching off of us.

She leaves her shit everywhere. Tonight I come into the computer room to find her trash everywhere from all the food she was stuffing her face with. She also spilled something on my nice Senneheiser headphones and did nothing about it. She has to go....

What really made me angry though was the fact that I'm pretty sure she is a thief. My sister has had money go missing in the past 2 months that Liz has been here and the other day $100 of grocery money in the cabinet went missing. There were only 3 people here that knew about this in our house when it went missing. Me, my sister (she didn't take it, she isn't going out because she has no money), and Liz who won't look you in the eye when you ask her about it. She says she ""has no idea where it could have gone."" I call bullshit. Who the fuck else could've taken it? This is how she fucking rewards my families hospitality, by fucking stealing our money?

I think I'm gonna gather up all her clothes out in the yard and take one mondo gigantor shit on them. Maybe that would make me feel better. Or I could threaten to do that and hold her clothes as ransom until she gave us back our money.

Grr....HULK SMASH!

Ohh, and good news. I don't know how many of you know this, but my family sold our house last week. Yesterday my parents found a new home in New Orleans that they will be buying. The bad thing is that they are building so we won't be moving down there til October. Weak sauce.

Ohh, and I'm not going to Chicago this semester like I hoped. I didn't get the amount of loans I need to make it happen. Although my father has agreed to cosign a couple private loans with me for the next semester. So next semester I should finally be able to go to film school like I have always dreamed of. I can only hope it works out for the best. 

No new news on the Andrea front of things right now. Her sister is in town this weekend so I didn't get to hang out with her at all. Luckily we will be going to the Ben Folds concert together in Kansas City in a couple weeks. It should be a good time to get everything out of the air. There will be drinking involved once we get back to Steiny's back in Columbia.

Ok, I'm tired now. Thanks for listening to my rant. It is part of a healthy diet."

The only consolation to this is that these people are in fact worse off than you. Feel free to point and laugh, but beware the karoke groupies might start to get angry...

Yea, I totally was at a bar that had karoke tonight and it was awful. Some people were truly awful. All of them were regulars at the bar apparently I found out after talking to the waitress. She said the whole group is kind of creepy. One guy changed the worlds to ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" to ""I like the old Star Trek shows"", so yea he's going to hell. I'll make sure not to go back to that bar on Sundays and Tuesdays. We were just there to watch the Cards game (which they blew it after tying it back up). Oh well I got to hang out with Andrea and that was cool. Her friend Jamie was there and her guy friend Mike. Mike was kind of a know it all asshat. He kept talking about how he has a rich uncle and rich aquatinces. He was a little tiresome. Jamie was cool though. She's Andrea's roommate, the not crazy one. But yea, the sandman just threw some dust in my face. I'm tired all the sudden. Weak....

Will give details upon request. I had fun, but I don't know if anything will be happening any time soon.

I'm not going to be all emo about it and be upset. I'm going to take it as what happens happens. I could quote silly songs like Kansas - Dust in the Wind, just to humor myself...and to just humor myself. I had a good time with her, we talked about a great many things. I didn't tell her exactly how I feel, but I did let loose a few things. She is my closest friend and every day I am with her I feel closer to her. Although at the moment it appears she still loves her ex, which is why I didn't say anything. Maybe in time her wounds will heal, until that point I will only help tend to those wounds until she is ready.

I will keep optimistic that someday I will be honored with a pure and great love. If it is Andrea maybe I will have yet another reason to rejoice, but today its not filled with such things. All I can do is have patience that the right person is out there for me. Although I think I have already found the person. She has a strong connection to me than any other person. I hope she realizes it before its too late and I am lost to her.

Oh well, enough of the sentimental stuff. I'm probably hanging out with her tommorow again. Maybe Monday also. Tonight she left with a hesitancy to her. She didn't want to leave my company which made me feel great. Maybe we can continue tommorow.

Until then thanks for all the support you guys have been giving me. I truly appreciate it."

"event","Well let's see where do I start off?

Ok well I arrived in Starkville at about 9:30 last Friday sat around at Jeremy's place for a little while and then we headed out to ""The Hunt Club"" where we had ""Greek"" cards, which really just means we get in for a $5 cover and drink as much as we want. I thought that was positively amazing. If I had a place I could do that I would go out and drink more often. I drank a couple beers and a couple jack and cokes and just chilled out. It was nice to have nothing to do and have no worries. We stayed there til about 1 in the morning then went back to Jeremy's place and hung out.

The next couple nights were pretty boring. We just drove around Starkville looking for things to do, or we played GTA: San Andreas. By the time I had left we had already made it to the Las Venturas portion of the game. So we spent a considerable time doing that because there is never anything to do in Starkville.

On the 4th of July we left to go to Memphis. First I had to do some laundry though, since I couldn't do it before I left because one of my sisters friends was using our washer and dryer to do her laundry. We went to this shady little laudrymat where I shit you not there was a pimp there. He was the perfect stereotype for a pimp. He even had a white caddy limo parked out front. I took a picture of him with my camera phone but it didn't turn out real well. Oh well, quite weak indeed.

Well we got to Memphis area around 7pm, but my buddy thought we were lost so we stopped at a gas station. Not the best gas station to stop at. When I pulled up I realized (and the patrons of the gas station too) that we didn't quite fit in. That's apparently when the signs above our foreheads that say ""EASY MARK"" showed up. I get approached by this one black guy wearing a tank top. He starts motioning for me to roll down my window. The first thing he says to me is....

""Yo man I ain't gonna rob you or nothing. Hit me up with some change man! Dey got a meal over dere for like fo fity. Man gotta eat ain't he?""

He sees the change in my center console and I give him some, probably about two dollars worth. He then says, ""You can give me more man, you don't need that change."" Which may be true but I have a problem with beggars, they didn't earn that money I did. Its kind of selfish I guess. I gave him the rest though. Although he only wanted the ""silver peices, you can keep dem pennies man."" After he had cleaned me out good he starts saying,

""Where yo partna at? Where he be?""

That's when Jeremy walks out with this look on his face. He knew what he had gotten us into. Immediatly I hear them talking. Once again he starts begging for money. Jeremy being a nice guy gives him two dollars he has in his wallet. The guy sees he has a ten in there and starts asking for that. Jeremy says no, and the guy says thanks any ways and we go about our way. After we get back on the highway we breath a collective sigh of relief. Memphis has a real bad crime rate and we were glad we didn't come another statistic.

So we get down to Beale St. and park by the Peabody Place. We walk Beale for a little while and then decided to eat at the Blue City Cafe which we have both heard great things about. Its a famous dive on Beale famouse for their ribs and steaks. We go there, it was nothing special. In fact my steak was pretty gross for what I paid. I don't think I'll ever recommend that place. I think it just gets its good name because its on Beale.

After we get out and I have a nice fresh stain on my shirt from the peice of steak I dropped. We walk Beale, we start looking for a bar that has the most hotties in it. Although for the 4th of July Beale was kind of empty. Its no more crowded than it is on any weekday night. Which still isn't bad, but its nothing like it should be. We soon find out why. The wrath of God was apparently playing there that night. As soon as we step in Peabody's Place it starts storming like crazy. We hope it won't be too long and decide to spend some money in Jillian's and hope it calms down while we are gaming. We play in there for a couple hours and come down and see that it is still raining like crazy. We have nothing else to do and Jeremy hasn't seen Episode III yet so we went to the Muvico 22 Cinema there and saw it. The theater was very nice. Great seats and good sound and bright screen. My adventure does not end here though.

Once we get out we start looking for which way we left our car. Another bum pops out of no where and says, ""You lost your car ain't you?"" Once again that flashing sign over our head must've appeared and we aren't ballsy enough to tell him ""No man we just like wandering around aimlessly hoping to find friendly bums who scam people!"".

Now this guy had to be one of the most interesting bums I've ever seen. Very talkative actually nice, but damn I didn't really want his help because as soon as he started walking towards us to show us the way I knew where we were and how to get back to the car. He starts talking about many things...

""Don't worry I ain't gonna rob ya or kill ya or anything. I protect ya! I used ta be a Marine. My main love is music though. Man I love Earth, Wind and Fire. I play all kinds of instruments. I'm a brass man myself...""(Jeremy tells him that I play brass instruments too)""...oh really that's good. I don't consider myself no singer though...""(yet he starts singing anyways)""....I recorded with Earth, Wind, and Fire in a studio around here a long time ago. Very nice people...."" (at this point we know he's crazy)""...I help you out, now you have to help me out...""(My first thought is if he is wanting oral pleasure that Jeremy is taking one for the team)""...can ya help a brotha out? Don't do it in front of the cops though...""

Jeremy gives him his last $2 dollars and the guy turns away disappointed. We start walking towards the garage we were parked in and another bum walks by and were all like ""Hey what's up?"" trying to act casual ya know. He says, ""Don't worry I ain't gonna hit ya'll up for money."" I still don't understand why all these people start out conversations with things like ""I ain't gonna rob ya, or kill ya, or take yo money..."" I guess they are trying to put you on ease so when you make it out safe you are willing to part with some money.

Well we get to the parking garage and realize we have no money to pay. No way I am going back out on that street again after 2am in the morning. So luckily our garage is connected to the Peabody and we can just go inside there and get to an ATM. It was nice for a little adventure though.

The rest of my trip was pretty uneventful though. We went to a little bar called ""The Veranda"" in Starkville. Its more of their upscale bar, but everyone seemed like they hang out together so I felt a little out of place. I had myself a couple Blue Moons and then I was ready to go.

Overall I had a good amount of fun. Its just nice hanging out with your best friend. Although I do have to say I am happy to be home. It would've been better if I could actually sleep on my nice matress but the cat already ruined that...oh well."

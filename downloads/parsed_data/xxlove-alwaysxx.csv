"event","we had another field trip today, we went to Jacob's Field, then after, we went to Tower City Mall, which really sucked because it took everyone about an hour to eat, so we only had like 20 minutes to shop... we only got in two stores!! ahh!!! But at F.Y.E. i bought AWESOME new head phones, and i got the movie Mean Girls for 6 bucks!!! so that was ok... but i got Sakkio Japan (i love that place) for lunch... it was yummy!!! :) lol"

"event","I slept over Bridget's house last night. it was a lot of fun!! We watched The Simple Life 1 on DVD, we jumped on the trampoline, and in the morning her mom got us Moo Lattes!!! Ashley and ppl from her class had to make a commercial about a product that they made up, and the product was called 'Brow B Gone' lol, they drew a uni-brow on kt. And Colin was screaming ""Catapillar!!"" in the kitchen (it was part of the act), it was funny. Then my mom got me Wendy's. Now I am sitting here... bored like always with nothing to do. But luckily we don't have school (yes!!!)."

"event","OMG we had a field trip to the LCCC Academic Fair. it was the most boring field trip i have ever been to. we had to sit through 'Baseball History' for about 30 mins. Then we were suppose to take a quiz on what would be our best job when we grow up... but it was canceled. The other glass got to learn a hip-hop dance. And we were suppose to do virtual baseball. but that was canceled too!! but at least we got to go to McDonald's after though... (luckily it wasn't canceled)lol"

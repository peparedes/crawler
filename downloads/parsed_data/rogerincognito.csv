Nick is busy putting keyboard parts on the ten pieces of music the band wrote in San Francisco and as of November 20th, everyone will be together in the UK to do another round of writing. </i>""

"event","I was walking on the pier today down at Fishermans Warf, cause we have been working on songs while here, and found a really neat little shop, it had all sorts of things, I got a little gold seahorse for Ells, and a few things for Elliot and Jamie, but enought about me, what do you think of me?


Okay I'm going to sign off now

Boosh!"

"event","I'm here in San Francisco looking across the bay towards Alcatraz, the 
Golden Gate bridge and the cityscape beyond on a beautiful sunny late 
September morning. This has to be my favorite city in the U.S (along 
with New York). As you possibly know we are here to start writing and 
recording our new album and this is an amazing and inspirational 
location in which to work. We already have 10 great working ideas for 
new songs, which seem to be taking a much more energized direction and 
a return to our roots as a band...again drawing on our early 
influences of Kraftwerk, Punk, Glamrock and Disco.

We are so excited about this new album and can't wait to get it out to 
the fans , we have another writing period before the European dates 
and hope to be ready for final recording and mixing in the new year...
fingers crossed for a spring release! Take Care - Roger"

"event","Back in London again after the final American leg of the Astronaut 
world tour  with just three more dates to go in Japan before we 
completely wrap up , have a few weeks of well earned rest  and get on 
with writing the new album in September which should be due for 
release early next summer with dates to follow soon after. 

The last few weeks have (as the folks in America say)  been an 
absolute blast with a great audiences everywhere (hats off to Atlanta 
, Baltimore , Pittsburgh and Jones Beach in particular ) and the show 
in Orlando with the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra was a really 
special night and something that we all want to do again sometime in 
the near future.

One thing that has struck me from onstage recently is the number of 
hand written signs appearing more and more in the audience..to name a 
few.. ""play the f*****g bass John""  ""Andy you are my pimp"" ""all Rhodes 
lead to Nick""  ""Simon will you S**g me"" (very direct)  and ""Roger I 
want to get my two hands hands on your stick""!!!!..all of which amuse 
us no end ..so keep up the good work.

It's also been great meeting many of the fans face to face in the meet 
and greets that have come from the fan community or have won radio 
competitions. Everyone has been so gracious and appreciative of the 
band and I wish I had a dollar for every time I've heard ""so glad you 
are back Roger"".

Oh...and see you in the U.K in December!
all love
Roger"

"event","I'm writing this from Hamburg in Germany, possibly
the most beautiful of all German cities..I was walking
around today thinking how amazing it is to playing
here again more than twenty years after our first
show and imagining how it was for the Beatles when
they played here in their formative years...wondering
if I was walking along a street that maybe they could 
have walked along . 
 
The shows have been smaller here in Germany but the 
warmth we have had from the fans and people in general has
been really wonderful, and its been a real pleasure to
be here . All the European shows have been great with
particularly great audiences in Milan, Verona, Prague
and Lisbon...and of course Birmingaham, which for me
was definitely the highlight of the band's career so
far (apart from hanging out very late with the
guys from Green Day  in Budapest!). Alas, it feels
as though we are nearing the final stages of the
Astronaut world tour and I must admit that we
already have one very excited eye on the next album,
which I think we will start writing in September due
for a next summer release....but of course there's
still that Earls Court show before Christmas!!

Ta Ta

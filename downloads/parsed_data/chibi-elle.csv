so i picked out my classes for the next 3 semesters. lets just c if they r available. i think they will b. my enrollment appointment is in 3 and a 1/2 hours. no more morning classes for me either. what ill do is stick to having classes only 2 days a week. then ask for those days off at work and work every other day. i think it will work out ok. i already picked out my major. i just have to go talk to an advisor or something to figure out which classes i should take and whatnot besides the basic introductory classes. 

idk y i cant sleep but im seriously frustrated. i dont want to work tom but i have to. i didnt want to work today cuz i was gonna b a waitress but thank god i did. i made 100 bucks and we were pretty slow. but it felt hectic cuz i would get like 3 tables at the same time with 2 other tables still waiting on their dinners yet i couldnt get it to them cuz i had to go to the new tables to get their drinks and all that bullshit. 

and i know this is gonna sound all gay and shit but my b/f seriously makes me happy. hes kinda like...idk too good to me. im so fucking annoying sometimes and i talk a lot of shit and idk bro. w/e im very happy. i think its funny though cuz like my boss is sometimes like trying to get us separated at work, and its not like were all over each other at all. in fact, we r pretty well behaved at work. but for w/e reason we just end up distracting each other somehow so yea. but shes really cool with it. he lets us leave at the same time and shit and sometimes we leave a lil bit early just so we can have fun b4 i must return to the claws of the dark one. 

i need someone to go with me to AFI...but now that i heard the new mcr album i want to c them live again at bake sale. but the bake sale lands on alexs bday so i want to b with him. umm i want to go to incubus next year, chili peppers, and taste of chaos 07.

ummmmmm i think im gonna go listen to the black parade now.

umm yea i cant sleep once again.

i guess ill talk about my day....

today was one of the up at the sushi bar (tony's) last day. apparently its tradition to throw a bucket of water on the person as they r walking out. thing is, the only person who would actually do that is alex (the alcoholic)and he wasnt working. so he passed by to drop off a game (drakengard) cuz he wants me to play it. when he got there we told him abuot tony so he decided to do it. but of course, im an evil bitch and i told him to go buy like 10 cans of silly string and we put it all over his car as well as toilet paper.
so when he came out alex got him a little bit and he almost wet akiko (my boss) it was sooooo funny. but then tony went around and decided to go out the other way so we couldnt get him but we had ppl hiding in most corners so we got him anyway. and we also silly stringed him.
boahahaa. good times good times.
oh and i also got wet and the attacked me with silly string. alex came in behind me and poured a pitcher of water on me. trying to get sily string out of ur long hair when its wet isnt really fun. i ended up all frustrated, i wanted to hurt alex so i kicked him where it hurts...again, and i looked all retarded with like sex hair and shit. of course alex enjoyed every minute of it....fucking ass....well i started it...BOAHAHAHA fun times fun times.

i started playing dirge and omfg im not used to it. i mean, ive only played ff and kh. fps...not for me apparently, but honestly i was kinda enjoying it. like, i think im gonna like it more than i thought i would. oh and i totally didnt know it had a tutorial thingy so im gonna try that out tom and c if i do better. god i love vincent. and his voice.....UGH ::melts::
since this week is basically my last week b4 school starts im gonna try to finish as much as i can. ill try to keep on with ffVI, dirge, drakengard, castlevania, and w/e other game i have yet to start lol.
i know its impossible....but ill try to finish as much as i can. 

im looking forward to tom. i hope we can play pool, but if not then thats cool too. 
well this is getting pretty long so i guess ill look for something else to do grrrr...

wow im bored. i just got back from sharpshooters. i refuse to go back there again. i think i walked out with lung cancer. but yea everytime i go EVERYONE drinks and then im there like....NO DRINKING FOR ME!!.....and then i suck at pool. ::sigh:: and so i was doing the next best thing...teehee....

anyways...i really feel like playing d of c which i still havent touched cuz i havent been able to, but i know i need to sleep now cuz tom will b pretty eventful. i decided to wake up as early as i can to play the game, and i think that around 11-11:30 pm i have to pass by shibui so i can silly string everyones car. oh yea and attack them with water balloons. i totally plan on getting alex (the alcoholic). thats gonna b awesome...the only downside is he'll probably run after me catch me and throw me into the garbage or something.

once school starts im gonna go back to the gym. actually i might also join la fitness. i know some of the guys from work go so maybe i should just go with them so that they can like train me a little or something. im really starting to get out of my lazy mood which is a fucking great thing. now ill b able to do good in school lol. 
im looking forward to the anime con. everyone at work is expecting me to dressup and im like...hahaha NO! i wouldnt dress up...ever....like...its too troublesome.
oh i just realized something....when ffXII comes out i have to beat it in like a day or 2 cuz if not...ill skip school...like when khII came out....i dont want any repeats.  
oh and idk if i already said this but i started reading the bleach manga and EVERYONE should read it. like after catching up...i realized how FUCKING AMAZING IT IS. like u know how like at first it was pretty good...and then u go to sould society and then it gets fucking amazing and u cant stop watching? well the manga continues...and its just like...WTF NOOOO OMFG HOW THE WHAT THE? AWESOOOOOME!! like it just keeps getting better and better. the fillers SUCK ASS compared to it. and the fillers arent even bad at all. well compared to naruto fillers.
well anyways ive run out of things to say....lol

OMFGWOW like the movie is sooooo good. my aunt is currently in nicaragua with 2 of her kids. so now im getting all the complaining from my cousin that hes hungry but he wont get his happy ass up to make food. hes kinda like me...but i dont make anything cuz there usually isnt anything to cook anyway.
u know what? i think mother is funny. like...shes so fucking immature. u can totally tell that shes starting to break...and she totally cant stand me anymore. we dont talk in person only through the phone now...unless shes telling me to do something or is bitching at me. but w/e...its just like...i wonder what she would do if i just left. i cant yet...but maybe soon. 
oh yea...tomorrow...actually today i get to pick my classes. im a bit excited but i kinda dont know what to pick yet. like im not sure if i should just pick slack classes...just so i can pass with the least amount of work so that i can have lots of time for my anime/manga/games. or if i should just take it serious. but im still in my lazy mood. and i get scared that i wont want to study.

OMFG 
i got a b on my test and i totally didnt study BOAHAHAHAHAAHAHA. well its an easy class anyway but still i think its funny. i remember that during the test i was just planning how many i had to get right on the next test to get a good grade to balance out the F i was gonna get. but i got a B...BOAHAHAHAHAHA lol sorry
ok...its 5 am. im not sleepy. at all. mother just walked in. and told me to turn off the internet and go to sleep. but im not sleepy. so i wont. y? wtf? y the hell is it necessary for me to wake up at like 7 with her? yea ok sure i can finish my chores and all that good stuff sooner...but then im left with nothing to do but get online only to find out there is nothing to do online either and then just sit here bored till i have to go to school and/or work. i end up doing all my chores and everything anyway...i just do it at my own pace and thats what she doesnt like. everything has to b when and how she wants it. shes not gonna get it. she threatened to take the internet away if i dont do as she says right now. so there....now u guys know...if im not for a few days...its cuz im waiting for dsl to get here. i was planning on getting it anyways but i was being lazy.
ill pay for it on my own and all...which reminds me i need to open a new bank account!!
ill do that one of these days.
thats it...ive decided....im gonna go get my phone fixed one of these days...

"event","so
today was just lots of things to think about. when i got up i did everything mother has asked me to do b4 she actually told me to do them. since, u know, i never clean and im a lazy ass and all. she better appreciate it cuz i probably wont do it again. my room is a mess though so im gonna try to keep it nice and picked up. so while i started cleaning the house a bit, i came up with lots of plans. im very excited about them. i just wish time would go a little faster. 
i realized lots of things about mother, the family, and a bunch of other stuff...and i actually remembered lots of things from childhood. i dont really try to think about it for many reasons but w/e. mother has pretty much been the same for as long as i can remember. she wont change....no matter how much i beg her or cry. and im tired of changing, and im tired of putting up with stuff.
i think certain aspects of my life r absolutely perfect right now. i love u guys very much and u guys make me happy. i love my job, my boss, and most of my coworkers. the only thing thats really keeping me down is mother. but thats it. im tired of complaining and im tired of drama. im drifting away from the girls in order for there to b no drama but there is still some at home. but i wont let it affect me anymore. none of this will affect me anymore. im not gonna complain anymore. the reason ive been complaining so much is bcuz i felt as if there is nothing for me to do, but there is. 
so there it is...i will try my hardest. im gonna stop coming up with excuses.

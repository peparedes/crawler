"event","ok so, yesterday we started rugby practice again, nice. it was fun playing 7's and seeing all the old coaches again. the 4 u-19ers wore our national team shorts, which are sweet by the way. yeah i'm really sore now, and my feet hurt, but its ok, no big deal. 

i hung out with christina oover the wekend, we were suposed to chill on saturday, but she had to work and do some family business. so instead chris and i dropped the hammer on soem covenent bastards. mid way through the night, dan's ""girlfriend"" (idk what to make of the whole deal) prank called us and business. chris and i responded in the usual manner, using our superrior intelect to confuse the living crap out of her. and chris called her trashy a bunch of times, which i dont think she liked, but oh well, she had kind of a foul mouth. but i enjoyed the whole deal. then the next mroning my dad bitched me out over soem stupid laundry and ruined my day. then christina came over and made it better, thanks hun.

AND death my be imminent because of grades, i got a 30, which is right on my average, i could bo better, but im not motivated at all. i got 2 d's on my exams but they are hard classes so i dont care. my parents will probably be pissed off alot. but i dont really care i'm not motivated, at all. i'm sure i will be ""inspired"" my my dad, which is to be expected after all. but who knows, they know i'm not an A student, even my guidance counselor says im a ""b-b+"" student, and thats fine with me. i dont care, i dont want to do anything related with the subjects i learned in this place. do i need to know about the framers of the constitution or Chaucer's old english??? hell no! but whatever, just teenage troubles, almost over tho, i suppose.

my girl situation has not improved, SHOCKER!!! but i dont really care about that much either. it would be nice to talk to someone of the female persuasion that likes/loves me. but its not a priority now. Big jim was goign to try his hand at matchmaker, but idk how that is going to turn out, for better or for the same.

in environmental news, chris has become the microcosm of US government Species rehbilitation/Reintroduction programs. (he has a baby mouse loose in his room that was indigenous to steven B's house) now he has a pest contorll problem and is looking to import predators of the mammal. much like the US government does when it's species that have been relocated spawn out of controll. so good luck chirs, if you need help, the erusian nightmare is on standby.

today i went to see Phantom of the Opera with some of the coolest kats i know. Christina and Cara. i havent seen them in a while and it was good to hang out, if only for a while. the movie was good. the phantom gets a bad rap i think. hes not such a bad dude, just a victim of his lonelyness. dude is a bad ass though, in my opinion. the music was ok i guess, im not a huge fan of opera, but you know how it is. but tomorrow its back to school! fucking yes!!! oh fuck me running this will be fun....

"event","another bomb sauce weekend, 
went skiing with dan and ian and sol and tex and ferrara. is was tons of fun. especialy yelling esoteric banter at passers by on the ski lift. i think my form and technique really improved from my last time skiing, which is a plus. a few lookers here and there, but all claimed or having the intellegence of a box of rocks. but whatever, i wasnt there for a booty call, i was there to shread. but it is funny to see the type of person that shows off their arm candy to all onlookers. they use their trophy girlfriends of what-have-you to convay some sence of superiority, and the looks they give you are priceless. the ""what are you looking at, i have a hot girlfriend and you dont"" look which is dashed when you engage them in full eyecontact. oh well. people like that will only find love in a small booth with a dropshade that only opens when you put quarters in a small slot. 
on top of that, we had 2 LAN parties this weekend, yeah two. it was fun, it was basicaly me chris and brendan and dan (or what i like to call Neo-ASF) dealing out death like it was a free sample of chicken at the take out chineese restraunt in the mall. excellent. dan driving the warthog and yours truly force feeding steel via Gauss rifle. but i do have to admit, my hubris backfired and douglass was laying the smack down on me a few times. and i was talking soem trash, and i think i got two carried away. so sorry if i pissed you guys off.
also watched FLCL, which is great stuff. Haruko is a babe but crazy as well. and Naota is a badass. and canti, mega-badass. but now its back to reality and midterms and business. but whatever...

chris has also made it clear that the Eva movies are awesome, which is something that had been in the back of my mind. how an enlightening piece of work (the entier searies + movies) can be pawned off as ""Just anime"" yeah right, the entier spectical challenges the human perceptions of reality and happiness, how can subjects like that be compared to shows like pokemon or fucking cardcaptors, it can't. and chris is really good at poerty. check his shit out on his LJ, amazing."

so over the weekend when i got back from U-19's i hung out with some kool katz. i hung with the usual crew, and we even found one of those elusive skulls in halo 2, but it sucked because it took away all the displays and gun's and things like that, we didnt even have radar.i alos got journey to jabruo, possibly the sickest gundam game ever, not like those weak souce knock offs. but before that i hung out with christina at her house. she was having an open house and dan and i using the help of yahoo maps found our way to her nice braintree home. it was fun, we watched elf and dan got grilled by some army recruter about selecting the marines over the army. it was a good time, then we went all the way to boston bowl and got yelled at for blocking ppl in. oh well. then we went to wendys and got soem good food. it was a nice change from taco bell and the mall, but we almost went to taco bell...almost. on the way home i say steven with this hot girl, idk who she is but  think shes ian's ex. we should start a ""we have a hot ex"" club and meet once a week to find new girls. oh and by the way, thanks to sol for kicking my ass over sam. your right, its not worth it. so i'm done lementing the fact,  so, i think im going to start the ""who wants to date a rugby player"" campaign back up, i mean it kinda worked last time right???"

so another thing crossed my mind last night, i was trying to fall asleep next to friggen dan who keeps moving every 10 seconds and shaking the bed. the program MASH was on and i was just listening to it. the guy hawkeye had been stationed with his ex and he was having issues with that and blah blah blah drama. but he said something that woke me striaght up. it went something like this "" when you left i hated you, hate! but as time went on, i got over the hate, but i couldnt get over the love"" now i said i wouldnt do this but its only my second offence. that got me thinking about how i feel about sam. i dont hate her by any stretch. i'm only dissapointed, dissapointed in everything. so my line would go something like "" when we split i was dissapointed, depressed! But i got over those, but i couldnt get over the love"" even after all this time, somewhere inside i do still love her, somewhere, idk how strong it is but its there. but as i said before i know it will never work, and that ains me to some degree. now if douglass is reading this i have this to say, shut up douglass. i heard fom unconfirmed sources that sam wants tog et back with me, and to be honest i would like nothing more. but again i know i would only be fooling myself. idk guys, idk. i guess this whole camp experience has showed me how alone i realy am...in terms of love. i mean this camp has also showed me that i have the best friends at home and i have 60 new rugby breathren. but it would be nice to come home to a loving girlfirend. i think thats what we all want on some level. but then again i'm only 17 and still have a long live to live. so for now let the good times role"

ON that subject, there is a strip club next to our hotel, which is kinda sketch, but whatever. all the time guys will be like ""lets go to the stripjoint"" but we all know that the coaches would kick our asses so no one does anything. not really alot of time to think about girls and stuff out here, which is a welcome change from being semi bummed out over sam. but i  needed to get away form everything, school, state parents, not necessarly friends because you guys are my boys. uhhhh, yeah what else. idk i have a turf burn on my ass, which sucks..ass. im tired as hell now=, but we have to paly another game at like 5:30 against some men's team. whatever im not too phsyked about that. but now just rest and by the way im on the adventure i wanted, but a little different, but i'll take it."

AND there is no one to hang out with, AND i dont have a girlfriend anymore, which doubly sucks. or sucks X2. becuase i was over it, but now i miss her, idk, well i guess i dont miss HER persay, but i miss having someone close to me of the female persuasion. i still remeber all the times we had and how awesome it was. but all that is gone now, its not my concern anymore,when we were togeather, i was fooling myself into thinking she was ready for a mature realtionship, which was not the case. I refer to a statement made by Riouji Kaji: ""we were just kids ritsu, just a couple of kids playing house."" when the relationship started failing, i tried despretly to Resuscitate it, but to no avail. and so it died. i'd like to get back togeather with her, but...i know it will never work. oh well, i guess now i can put her behind me, and move on. but i dont want this journal thing to be me bitching all the time.
on a lighter note im on vacation finally. which is awesome, but there no one here, hence my delema/remorse. i'll probably wait for chris to get home from stop and slave, then chill with him and the usual gang. i want to hang out with some BCH kids and maybe a few females, but that will come later. for now , ill jsut chill by meself."

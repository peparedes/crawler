Oh dear...

So I saw an odd interview today when watching a little of the ANZAC stuff.  This guy was oulling randoms out asking questions about the day, if they lost anyone etc, and also, how does your sub-culture/demographic celebrate ANZAC day.  He as pulling different people out by the way they looked, derro guy, man in a suit etc then asked a girl in black pants and a long black coat, but not at all gothy, near me so I could hear her answers.  When asked how her sub-culture/demographic celebrated ANZAC day she looked down and smiled saying, you mean goth?  He agreed so she said that her and her friends cut themselves to symbolise the blood of the men who died, drank the blood to symbolise mother earth taking back her sons then ate Turkish fr dinner/  He was stumped working out if she was serious or not and all he could say was, 'do you do thisevery year?'

It was brilliant :D

The glitter fairy's birthday is this Sunday, still ain't got all his pressie together.  Damn those boyfriend types!

Mickey's birthday was last weekend, it was funky in all different ways, if only I could remember it all. I put cut up wigs all through my hair, am going to get a fringe cut, and am trangely tempted to dye it pinkish purple and yellow :P

Not much else.  Still working, nothing much is happening there, except now we have awesome regular lunatic customers, all three of which I've been stuck with whenever they come, but they're fun and minus the fustration it's worth it.
Also, Jeremy Ions look-a-like came to work today. He was very short, but so sexy anyway :D  All us gals made sure we saw him...  *swoon*

Blarh...  May just run away now...

Am still working at Borders, and I really like it there :)  still going out with the glitter fairy, I like it there too.  Still have no idea what to actually do with my life.  Clearing out my inbox seems to be what I'll be doing forever.

One of my old teachers is Dan's principal and asked Mum and Dad about me and told them what a great student I was :) made me happy.

Am sick, which aids the quitting smoking thing as I'm at home all day, I don't like to smoke in front of parents, plus I get to sleep all day.
I'm not doing well so far, but at last I've cut it down heaps and have no more left to smoke.

Smoke, smoke, smoke.

Anyway. My birthday was rad, I got presents and affection.  Affection is rad!  I got a digital camera so I can now bombard livejournal with photo's of me, looking rad. Oh yeah!  Plus pgoto's in general.  Got a Fairy floss maker which will be broken in on saturday night.  Man, I want fairy floss.

Have been really slack lately.

Borders is rad, people are very nice and sending me get better messages.  The boys out back got me a birthday cake and Borders gave me a sex kitten reindeer toy.  Plus, you know, everyone there is really nice and friendly in general.

People (or more person) have managed to amuse me once more with their silliness.

Rose and I were at her house last night drink wine and watching the interview with Terri Irwin by Ray Martin.  It was great, she would get really teary and sob and Ray would lean over, pat her knee and ask the next question.  Watching it prompted me to start looking around for Steve Irwin jokes, I've been disappointed by the amount I haven't been hearing.  there's so few, and the people who do put them up get 'yelled' at for being so insensitive.

If anyone has any can they please write them in a comment to me?"

"event","Hey-a...

Just a small update to say that we raised $687.45 on saturday night for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus.  Dad's going to take the total up to $700, I believe Mum suggested that he do it.  I had an awesome night, I hope everyone who went did too.

I spent sunday with Nick, James and Craig alternately driving Nick insane with my awesomely awful Pikmin skills, and being driven insane by Craig and James and their 'beautiful music'.
Craig and I played Gamecube late into the night last night, trying to remember how to unlock the secret characters in Smashbrothers (?) Smashsomething.  We unlocked Jigglypuff.  No one tell us how to get the others, I want to work it out (or beg Daniel when I get too frustrated with it).

The wedding was on saturday afternoon, and it was beautiful.  Trish looked gorgeous and Adam was very handsome. Adam's parents were very sweet; his Dad asking if he could keep both when told that Mickey would be handing him the microphone after singing and his Mum after the ceremony thanking us for our 'beautiful music'.  There were butterflies that didn't want to leave the box in a hurry, Craig, Mickey and I played well, the binding was really nice, hopefully Adam was suitably surprised by Songbird.

So all in all a good week in the land of Alex.  (Including getting the job.  Yay!)

Very sleepy now, might go back to bed before cycling to Ginninderra Gardens to give the written resignation."

The orangey one is Moby Dick (named by Mum) and the black one is Kitty (named by Mickey).  I wanted to call them Alex and Craig but he wouldn't allow it.  He also won't accept that he's now a daddy of my fishies :(  Poor Daddy-less fishies...

We think the orangey one might be pregnant, poor bastard baby fishies the Moby Dick might have...

In other news, going to Lot 32 later to be amazed by John and Sam's leet dj-ing skills.  Waiting for the football to finish before we go.  Go Broncos (the fishies go for the Broncos at the moment as well)

And more other news COME TO SPINA BIFIDA CHARITY TOMORROW NIGHT!!!  If you love me you will :)"

Does anyone have any vacancies?  I'll do anything except caring/looking after people.

I really, really, really need a new job.

In other news I'm going to be doing a fundraiser night at the Pot Belly for Spina Bifida.  In September, which strangely enough is Spina Bifida awareness month.  Joan thinks it's a good idea and I'm calling her this afternoon to discuss dates and what I think and she thinks should happen.

This is where I point out I'm not actually a good person, I just wanted an excuse to use the Pot Belly Wheel :)  I figure you people put in $2 to get a number and the winning number gets two jugs of beer :)

Anyway, this has taken me about half an hour to post, I'm writing while reading through job  vacancies.

You'd think in job ads they'd at least say what company they're for or where they're located.  Out of about 40 jobs so far easily half, probably more haven't said anything about their company, just that they want people.  Odd.

Going to go to the New Zealand high commision today to see if I can get dual citizenship :)

And in other news, a nurse at work thinks that the reason I've been sick (other than the cyst thing) is because my glandular fever has decided to plague me again, apparently it never leaves the system.  So doctor's tomorrow to have some blood tests done and what not.  It explains the exhaution I've been having lately :)

Still living with Craig and Rose, tis still quite fun and nice.

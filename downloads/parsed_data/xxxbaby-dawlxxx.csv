"event","welp its official I have the Flu! grr.. I've been feelin like shit all week and I just got back from the doctors and he said I have the Flu.. updates:

Monday: got up at 4:30 for hockey practice.. worked my butt off cause the sickness was setting in and i didnt feel good.. then after practice went to school to shower and get ready for school.. while i was in the shower i heard mrs. murphy come over the announcements but i wasnt quite sure if i heard right.. something about school being cancelled and all the girls in the locker room started screaming and freaking out.. when I got out of the shower I asked what was going on school was cancelled whoop whoop! a pipe burst or something! so we got showered and dressed then Sarah drove me, Spaz, & Amanda out to breakfast with Charlotte.. we went to Newport Creamy near LSA but madd LSA people we already there and we didnt feel like waiting so we went to Friendlys instead.. we just all chylled and were bein stupid.. then when I got home chylled out for a while and what not.. then Bri came over cause she had the car and her and I drove around for a while being stupid.. then me and my sis went to the mall.. fun filled day.. but we hada take ripta home and being out in the cold didnt help at all! 

Tuesday: didn't feel good at all I tossed and turned all night long and I had like the sweats and the chylls I was flippin out! I was hacking my brains out coughin so much. wicked stuffy nose and what not. And just my whole entire body hurt. I don't cry when I'm sick but I was sittin there crying because no matter what i did.. stand.. sit.. lay down.. it was like I was putting pressure on my body and it hurt. I attempted to sleep all day but it didnt work i was awake.. sleeping.. awake.. sleeping.. and i didnt eat at all the thought of food was making me sick! and once I was finally awake enough to talk I called Nate because I had felt bad that he wanted me to cover for him because he didnt know I was sick and probably thought I was being a huge bitch because he covers for me all the time. So I called him and explained then he felt bad he kept calling me so many times monday night trying to see if I would.. he called my house a buncha times and my cell.. then over night he called 7 times can you tell he really didnt want to work? but he ended up calling out sick and someone else took over.. so I was glad because I felt bad!
Today: got up at 4:30 for hockey practice I went but I didnt practice I was waayy to sick.. and coach bob said he didnt want me getting sicker by playing tonight at the game so I had to rest and he was playing me in Saturdays game.. so I chylled out all day sleeping and what not.. then my mom was going to take me to a walk in to get checked out then take me over to Spaz's so her dad could take me to the game so I could at least watch.. but the walk in doesnt take our insurance anymore.. I guess it doesnt take Blue cross blue chip or something so my mom made a doctors appointment for me for 5:15.. she was going to drop me off at the game after but when the doctor said I have the Flu and he cant put me on any meds my mom said I have to stay home tonight.. grr! I just felt really bad because I wanted to go and support my team plus it's Spaz's first game she played in and I missed it! but what can I do I feel like SHIT.. arg.. but at least because of the plumbing problems at school we havent had school.. they are reopening tomorrow weather permitting but I'm not going either way so I hope it gets cancelled so I don't miss! I want to stay out Friday too but if I do then I can't play in the game Saturday (stupid school rule!) I'm really whiped out so I'm going to go.. I have some pics to post but Ill probably do it tomorrow or something cause I'm guna pass out.. xO"

What you see's not what you get
With you there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there
Your eyes they sparkle
That's all changed into lies that drop like acid rain
You washed away the best of me
You don't care

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

Sometimes shattered
Never open
Nothing matters
When you're broken
That was me whenever I was with you
Always ending
Always over
Back and forth, up and down like a rollercoaster
I am breaking
That habit
Today

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

There is nothing you can say
Sorry doesn't cut it, babe
Take the hint and walk away
'Cause I'm gone
Doesn't matter what you do
It's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth
Now I'm gone

What you see's not what you get
What you see's not what you get

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Oh, I'm already gone, gone, gone, gone
Already gone
I'm gone"

I wont talk
I wont breathe
I wont move till you finally see
That you belong with me

You might think I dont look
But deep inside
In the corner of my mind
Im attached to you
Im weak
Its true
Cuz im afraid to know the answer
Do you want me too?
Cuz my heart keeps falling faster

I've waited all my life
To cross this line
To the only thing thats true
So I will not hide
Its time to try
Anything to be with you
All my life I've waited
This is true

You dont know what you do
Everytime you walk into the room
Im afraid to move
Im weak
Its true
Im just scared to know the ending 
Do you see me too?
Do you even know u met me?

I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing thats true
So I will not hide
Its time to try anything to be with you
All my life I've waited

This is true

I know when I go ill be on my way to you
The way thats true

I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing thats true
So I will not hide
Its time to try anything to be with you
All my life I've waited

I'm on a path to <b>self-desctuction</b>, I need to get away. I can't feel anymore, I'm numb, numb to everything. I <sup>hate</sup> the way things are & I <i>need a break.</i> I'm so used to faking happy I can hardly tell the difference anymore...

<marquee scrollamount=1> ""Don't stay
forget our memories
forget our possiblities
just gimmie myself back & don't stay
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day of you wasting me away 
with no apologies"" </marquee> 

It's so hard to escape when shit is constantly being thrown in your face. You have to watch everything you say & do everything's always blown out of proportion or distorted view.
<marquee scrolldelay=500 scrollamount=5> ""I will never know myself until I do this on my own
& I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed,
I will never make anything until I break away from me
I will break away
I'll find myself today
I wana heal, I wana feel
What I thought was never real,
I wana let go of the pain I've held so long..</marquee>

sorry for all the Linkin Park songs.. they just really seem to fit!

I miss him so much it's terrible.. I want to break away from this, from him, but I can't somehow no matter how hard I try to get away from him I am always led back one way or another.. any suggestions on how to just STOP loving someone? I just want it to be over.. I feel like when I date other guys I hold them to these unfair standards.. I expect every guy to be just like him and do the things he does.. but no one is him.. no one is him!I guess I'm always going to love him.. But I can't keep going back to him.. Seriously, It's killing me and messing everything up. I can't really say what I want to say about it.. you know god only knows who reads this.. maybe I'll make a friends post about it later.. coz I need to vent on everything that has been going on between us! well yeah if you wana know who or what that is about leave some posts.. I have blabbed enough for now!"

"event","2056...Its strange. Yet comforting. Since Kro, Mi an Dante are out in the stables doing some quick chores(Stuff I can't ever hope to do again, who knew anyone would miss shovelin hay an stuff?) I thought I'd sit an look back over everything. Dangerous habit for some but I figured I might as well, having finished everything for the next few days, days before(go me, now I have nothing to do which drives me nuts)

Random thinking, so thus its behind a cut.
<lj-cut>

I'm not sorry completely for what I left behind, I'm actually completely content and happy with my life as it stands. This last year I lost what of my blood family I had left...But gained so much more. I never really got to enjoy New Years, always was working and it wasn't such a big deal I guess. Even after my 'accident' and I ended up living on my own with Mi as my helper it wasn't a huge deal. He had family and friends he'd go visit on christmas and throughout the New Years. So I would work around the tiny 2 bedroom appartment that was able to be accesible for a wheelchair and keep busy.

Its been strange sleeping in a room that was the size of a good portion of your old home.

Anyways so, first Christmas at TSE. I think it was a success. I got most if not all of what I wanted to get for everyone(now that I've completely paid off bills from my past that would make anyone cringe..) its just...so strange. Not living in finacial hell, or constant fear of some sort. I still remember counting pennies. 

Surreal would be the word I figure. Not being alone on New Years Eve. Actually having someone you love to kiss at midnight~chuckle~ I came back from the local equine clinic for papers for Venus so Kro wouldn't have to do it, and barely had enough time to run an wish him a Happy New Years.~grin~ 

Now that everyones up and about, me without my coffee for once-which is not normal I know- I decided to sit and think. I'm thankful for everything thats happened in the end. Sure I wish some things hadn't but what would that have meant if they hadn't happened? ie. if I hadn't become disabled I wouldn't have stopped gymnastics, wouldn't have learned mechanics for a full time job instead of a side hobby, wouldn't have had to leave home, try and get another job. I wouldn't have gotten my might as well be pain in the ass 'brother' Michael. Or that damn Brit as a boss and friend...And I wouldn't have met Kro.

So everything happens for a reason, and it makes me wonder what this year holds for me, us. Now that I have people that in the end truelly give a damn.

I know my New Years Resoulution.

End over thinking post :P

And I'm sorry for it. I just hate having to admit most of the time I need help. But I love ya Kro hon, you've done more for me then you realize. Or maybe do I don't know. But you've treated me better then anyone I've ever met.

I sound mushy my apologies though its the truth~chuckles~

Dearest Lea,*you can practically hear the sarcasm there*

Since my last visit to you costed me my truck and your boytoy took a sledge hammer to it this is a warning. I already have a court martial for you to pay for the trucks repair or repair it yourself. You also will owe me 20k in stress damages for destroying my property. If you fail to comply in 48 hours to this email saying you agree to terms, you will be arrested and brought to supreme court where it will be forced and you will be fined further.

Also since I got injured by you 'boyfriend' I am also demanding 5k in medical charges.

Have a nice day.

"event","I've been bad about LJ that much I can admit. Alots been going on. And obviously I think I managed to clean out the skeletons from my closet I think.

<lj-cut text=""Let me explain"">
Since it turned out my father cheated on my mother things have been strange. Especially because of my might as well be twin sister named Rea. Yes haha I'm Lea. She was always jealous I was a famous gymnast and she was some chick that was trying to get a job still. Anyways after Dad and MY mother died, my insurance wouldn't cover me. But being about to turn 21 I didn't mind at the time. My full blood brother, and Leroy celebrated my 21 bday with me, and were killed in the same accident that took my ability to walk. So happy birthday to me huh? 

Well since I didn't have medical insurance all the money I had from being a 'famous' gymnast was used up, and then some. Because of this alot of money had to apparently be taken from the funeral funds while I was comatose. Well at that point I was worthless to my step mother and sister, I couldn't do gymnastics anymore. They rubbed it in my face that it was my fault so I left them. Just left, I couldn't pay them back. I kept costing medical money so I left, it was supposed to be better. 

Well after awhile I called Rea out to come 'punish' Mi for being annoying. Well things went astray. She kept verbally attacking me-thus actually managing to piss Kro off. But when we started arguing he hid in teh shop where I ran into her again an she ripped into me. I never felt so horrid in my life and Kro saw me at my weakest. Well in the end he decided he was going to bang up Rea's new truck um I let him too. Well she saw it all an tried to get me to stop him and I refused. So she snapped and slapped me, with a backwards ring on her hand so the stone cut into my cheek. I knew then that my sister didn't even view me as a person anymore. Yay..

I was startled that Kro immeaditatly just went and drop kicked her pissed that she hit me. SHe then left an Kro and I decided a movie to unwind would be good. So after seeing a movie(Kro's so cute, some guys were apparently eyeing me abit to friendly an he scowled at 'em ;P) we headed home watched another movie and plopped on the bed and just kinda konked out. He's still asleep, I'm carefully using a laptop to do this so he won't wake up ^-~ He's adorable when he sleeps I'll tell ya that, really peaceful and its nice to have company.

Ryder seemed to like him right off (which is slightly new since he doesn't like Michael much. Or vice versa they kinda like each other but prefer other company an that took a long while)

But now my baby's running around active and all. So everythings good.  Hmm what else...Michael's commenting Kro has compatition now, for what I have no idea. ~eyes Michael~  An he won't verify. I don't even know if it even links to me~shakes head~

In one hour we will see if the lack of milk is going to be a problem. I didn't measure the pumpkin, either, so there might be enough to make up for the lack of moisture. The batter seemed the right texture... 

Guess we'll find out."

"event","Well, the final numbers have come in. Our budget for the coming year is down almost one million dollars, bringing us down to the same budget we had in 1989, when I was 11. We are losing 17 permanent staff and all casuals...more than 30 in total. It is the largest layoffs ever for the organization and PCC has held this grant uncontested for more than 15 years. It is unbelievable. I am so thankful that I already had a back-up plan in place. 

So, in keeping with birthday tradition, I came down sick yesterday and have spent the last two days in bed. Not that I am complaining; a sinus infection is better than being in the office right now. I am feeling a little better just in the last hour and decided to cook. 

I made soup yesterday with leeks, but still had all the green portions of the leek left on the counter. So, I am roasting chicken breasts with shredded leeks, tomatoes, garlic, and lemon zest. It should be a nice summer dish. I only hope I can taste it. 

So, my brother is actually getting married. They have not set a date, yet, but I suspect much of next summer will be spent helping them with wedding things. I just hope I won't have to give a speech. Fat chance, I know...only sibling and published poet. Not likely to avoid those honors. 

My brother wants to take my parents on a two week camping trip in September to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. He thought it would be nice to combine it with his honeymoon. I hope I have managed to talk him out of that. His best friend took all of their friends on their honeymoon when he and his wife got married. My brother thought it was cool. I thought it was weird. One way or another, it looks like most of my vacations for next year will be spent with family."

My folks didn't take the ""We won't be here for Christmas"" conversation very well, which is funny, cuz they're Jewish. Still, they aren't very good at sharing.

"event","So, on Tuesday I was sick. I spent the whole day on the couch being annoyed with how messy our apartment is. On Wednesday, I was feeling a little better, but not well enough to go to work. So, I traded off cleaning and napping. I then bought some new planters (did I really need MORE of them?) and planted some new herbs (garlic chives and purple basil), five kinds of greens, carrots, beets, and a Mister Lincoln rose for my lovely boyfriend (part of his Valentine's Day gift). I then crashed out at 6:30, worn out from being overly productive with a cold. 

I did not go to work again today. Both W and I had already taken the day off. It was supposed to be a lazy day...opening gifts, chilling over a long cup of coffee, having lunch with friends, and helping Paco put in his garden. But, W came down with the flu, so I had lunch with friends by myself and spent the rest of the day running back and forth to the grocery store for whatever item W seems to want...applesauce, juice, tylenol. Poor thing. I have never seen him so sick. He has finally conked out and I am now watching a movie. What a weird Valentine's Day! 

Guess we will be canceling the wine tasting tomorrow. Sigh. Guess that gives me more time to stare at my tiny little plants popping up in my new planters. Woot!"

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Coffee Snobbery""><p>I stopped this morning at Starbucks to order a cup of tea and had a truly strange experience. I was corrected on the proper ordering of my drink by the cashier. Next time I am meant to&nbsp;order a ""Tall Tea in a Venti Cup"" not&nbsp; a ""Venti Tea with only one tea bag"".&nbsp;<br /><br />This is particularly funny because I have been corrected by other cashiers at other stores about how to order my drink. Once I mistakenly asked for a ""short"" cappuccino in a Coffee People. The cashier responded, ""You must not come here much. Only Starbucks (shudder) has a short drink on the menu. We have a 12 oz, a 16 oz, or a 20 oz. So, what do you want?"" Incidentally, Starbucks does not have a short drink on their menu. You have to be an insider to know it exists and ask for it. It is also the only thing on their menu that is even remotely close to a real cappuccino.&nbsp;<br /><br />I understand that people get prissy about their coffee. I understand. I only want one tea bag in a 20 oz cup and I like an equal proportion of coffee to milk, not a splash of coffee in a bucket of luke warm dairy product. So, I can sympathize with that person in front of me in line whose drink takes three minutes to order. What I don't understand is this new (or not so new)&nbsp;trend in snobby cashiers. Don't they understand they work for tips and that correcting your customer's ordering behavior is as bad for getting a tip as correcting their grammar?&nbsp;Well, evidently not.&nbsp;<br /><br />Still, I can forgive the tea guy this morning. If I order my tea the way he says, I save $1.20 over what I would pay if I order it my own way.&nbsp;I appreciate that kind of inside knowledge, which is actually how I found out about the short drink, too. But this getting chastised for my use of terminology is retarded.&nbsp;I want that cashier to come to my place of work and try to ask for a single form without messing up the acronyms. Ha!<br /></p></div><br />Ok, I have had my rant. Now on to Christmas. It is looking likely that I will be having as many as 40 people over on Christmas Eve, but it is an open house, which means no one needs to RSVP. That leaves me virtually NO information to go on for planning the food, a real problem for an obsessive foodie like me. My mom does this every year, but then she has been doing it for 30 years with the same guests and they all come every year, regardless of whether or not she bothers to actually invite anyone. So, what do I make? Any thoughts from you fellow party planners?<br />&nbsp;"

In tomorrow's mail, there will be approximately 200 cards,&nbsp;hand written but brief, with destinations all over the world (13 countries on last count). Another two dozen are yet to be written or lack addresses (that's you K and K). 

My grandmother beat into my head that hand written cards must be sent every year to anyone you do not see on a weekly basis and wish to see again at some point. These days, real Christmas cards are a rarity. Many people now type one letter, print it 50 times, and stick it in an un-signed card. I find these theses&nbsp;depressing. Even a brief message of&nbsp;best wishes&nbsp;written in pen by the person sending it is far better than a typed novella about every detail of the child's teething or the dog's broken foot. 

Still, I think my card writing habits have gotten out of hand."

This gets me to my central thought for the morning...distance.&nbsp;<br /><br />We talked about various places we could go that were close, relatively comfortable for&nbsp;my city boy, and yet wild enough to appeal to me. If I were at home, I can think of at least seven or eight place where we could go that would not be a ""long"" drive and would be beautiful but accessible. But here in Oregon, I struggle.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oregon is roughly 98,000 square miles. Colorado is roughly 104,000 square miles. Colorado is bigger, yet it still feels that everything is closer than in Oregon.&nbsp;<br /><br />Long Lake is a&nbsp;90 minute drive from Boulder. So is Rocky Mountain National Park. I have taken day trips to both of those places without even a thought to pack a lunch...just hop in the car and go. On the other hand, both Canon Beach and Mount Hood&nbsp;are about the same distance but seem far even for a weekend getaway.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, what is it that makes that distance seem so different? Is it the open Colorado sky? Is it the difference between my boyfriend's lack of interest in the outdoors and my mom's manic need to get out of the house before 9? Or is it my own temperament, my own&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;that Oregon&nbsp;is a place of long grey winters and Colorado is one of crisp sunny days?&nbsp;<br /><br />Today, the compromise is Sauvie's Island...20 minutes to a nice beach within easy reach of both a Starbucks and a grove of trees, free from people, my phone, and this computer.&nbsp;<br /><br />But, I hate that Portland still does not feel like home.<br /><br /></p>"

"event","I can tell that fall is coming. On Friday I roasted a whole turkey, made 4 gallons of stock (now frozen), and made a large batch of home made mole (also now frozen). Saturday I did laundry, cleaned the kitchen, and went to a very lovely bridal shower. Today my sweet and obliging other half helped me indulge my pastoral urges by driving me all the way out to Sauvie's Island just to go to the Pumpkin Patch for fresh local vegetables and fruits. We bought blueberries, pears, nectarines, peaches, cucumbers, green and red tomatoes, rainbow radishes, and..for William...baby sweet corn pickles. We then hit up the regular store for the week's necessities (bread, butter, and orange juice) before returning to our mostly clean apartment. I have spent the afternoon cooking...Mexican Spinach Bread, cream biscuits, home made turkey sausage, and now watermelon pickles, which are cooling (stage 1 of 3) on the counter. I will not be able to actualy can them until stage 3, which will be on Tuesday. And I think I will only get 4 half pints, but it had been a fun experiment. If they are good, I will have to do them again for Christmas presents. Now my twice baked potatoes are in the oven and my house smells like roasted garlic.&nbsp;

If only I could make Sunday bliss carry over into the week..."

"event","<p>We spent the weekend in Bend with friends Calina and Tyson. They have a tiny farm. We fed chickens, collected fresh eggs, ran a booth at the farmer's market, and generally embraced the better sides of a pastoral existence. I loved the sun-warmed earth between my fingers as I pulled radishes from the garden and the sweet fruits of the season, purchased&nbsp;for mere&nbsp;coins from tiny stalls manned by Hmong farmers' wives. The plums on my pancakes and&nbsp;the fresh eggs, fried in bacon grease, were like a slow lovesong on the early breath of day.<br /><br />But, to be perfectly frank,&nbsp;I can pass on the chickens. They smell. They peck. And they wake you up with their cawing racket at the very edge of dawn.&nbsp;<br /><br />My need for my own piece of earth is growing. I want a small orchard and a large garden. I want to have to can fruit every year because I have too much. But my own pastoral urges do not go so far as to include livestock. I draw the line at cockadoodledoo.&nbsp;<br /><br />William, I think, would draw the line a little closer to the city limit, like the edge of the parking lot of the last Starbucks. But, he had fun eating fresh eggs and chilling in the park on a sunny afternoon (comic book firmly between him and any view of nature). So, all in all, a successful weekend away.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I am baking and cleaning to get ready for the week. May God help me preserve this enchanted calm through a week of intense office drama! </p>"

"event","Well, it is down to the wire. We have unpacked MOST of the boxes in the new place and I have less than a week at my current job. Tomorrow will be my last day at my desk.&nbsp;I am both sad and strangely elated. I will miss this place and, most importantly, these people. However, the changes that have ousted me from my comfortable spot have brought other changes that would make my continued employment here decidedly less appealing. Namely, one individual whom I am not on friendly terms with (understatement of the century) will be relocating here. I am not at all sad to miss an opportunity to sit side-by-side with her&nbsp;insanity. This move has, also, pushed&nbsp;me into making contact with people I might otherwise have considered above my access. In the past two weeks I have&nbsp;met with three deans and the president of the extended learning college. I am playing all my cards to get onto&nbsp;the main campuses and into the academic side of things.&nbsp;Had I not been staring unemployment in the face, I might not have taken those risks.&nbsp;I hope they prove worthwhile. In the mean time, I will take the new position&nbsp;I have been offered and be happy for the paycheck.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Monday and Tuesday of next week will be training (the only training I get) for the new job. After our vacation, I will be dumped into a classroom of 60 people (all welfare recipients) without any assistance...baptism by fire. So, the beginning of next week will be interesting, as it will be my only chance to glean the&nbsp;information I need on how to run this program.

Wednesday will be my&nbsp;goodbyes and then trying to get on the road before 3:30, so we can make it to Boise with enough time to sleep a full eight hours in preparation for the 15 hour day of driving to follow.&nbsp;

By midnight on Thursday, we should have arrived at my folks' place in Colorado, exhausted and ready to be pampered for a few days. My childhood friend is getting married on Friday night in a ceremony that will likely prove fodder for conversation for many upcoming years. Saturday will be time with the folks and introducing W to all the friends he missed on the last trip. Sunday we are going to Cirque du Soleil and dinner at a French Patisserie.&nbsp;

Monday the 25th we head to Santa Fe for a real vacation,&nbsp;sans family. Details and photos will follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

So...

many changes...

most of them good."

"event","This last week has been wretched, so I will avoid a lengthy discussion of personnel problems, work-related mediations with paranoid crazy people, and three-day long migraines and go right to the important things...and they're just that, things.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Things"">W and I bought our first few really co-owned items. A few weeks ago we bought a single set of towels (gray and pale green) and a single set of dishes (black and red). Then on Sunday we purchased a new couch, which is huge and squishy and gray. It will be delivered tomorrow to the new place. W is also intending on buying a new kitchen table and chairs and I am buying a grill. I know, I recognize that those seem backwards, but really, we're just weird. W had to talk me out of the bigger grill because it would not fit on our porch. I still don't understand why one needs to fit furniture on the porch, if one can have a huge grill that gleams in the evening light, but whatever. <br /><br />Today we began the packing and culling. The first thing to go was our His and Hers dishes. I am sure someone will like them, but I will not miss them in my space, especially not the HIS variety... :)- After the dishes, we sorted most of the rest of the kitchen, disposing of any doubles of things, like pizza cutters and measuring cups. I have since sorted all of my clothes, shoes, and accessories. I will be giving away two bags of my own belongings and one of W's ex's clothes, which he had borrowed some three or four years ago (longer?!) for a drag party. Also to go is the gridded table I built to house W's Battle Sister's army, our long hall rug, the kitchen table I covered in marble tiles last summer, my sewing/place-to-pile-clothes chair, and all of my various computer parts. <br /><br />So, the pilgrimage has begun. And for the first time, our place will feel like a couple likes there, rather than two people whose belongings were all mysteriously piled into one room. SO Weird! <br /></div>"

"event","<p>So, here it is, my final update on school and our long-term plans. I was accepted at only one of my four schools, which is actually not a bad ratio. But I was not offered a teaching assistanceship and the fellowship I was offered does not cover enough of the tuition to make school feasible for this year. They offered me a discount, essentially, allowing me to pay 150%&nbsp;of&nbsp;in-state tuition instead of out-of-state tuition, which still works out to $6000 / year. I did not think it was fair to up-root William for a situation that was just going to add to our financial stress. So, I turned down the fellowship this morning. There is about a 2% chance that I will be offered an assistanceship if someone turns theirs down, so a 98% chance that we are not moving this year. I am crushed and I do not say that lightly.&nbsp;I am a planner. I am not someone who can just stay in a job and be happy to be employed. I need to be moving forward in one way or another. This was my five year plan.&nbsp;<br /><br />I admit that it does not help that very few people are sad for me. More than one friend of William's said they were glad...to my face...which I felt was a bit rude. Others have been open about being pleased we will not be leaving Oregon this year and that I will not be ""dragging William away."" No one seems to care that we made the decision together. <br /><br />But I guess I am getting used to the idea that I will need to rethink everything. If I do not get the assistanceship at the last minute, I&nbsp;will defer my position at the one school and hope for an assistanceship for next year.&nbsp;We are going to move to a new apartment, hopefully by May, and I will continue to work. Otherwise, I will begin studying to re-take the GRE Subject exam and will consider reapplying next year to a new set of schools. <br /><br />F*cking Fabulous. </p>"

"event","1 1/2 pound lamb roast - cubed 
1 large eggplant 
2 handfuls green beans - preferably the petite ones 
1 cup whole wheat couscous - uncooked 
1 cup plain yogurt - greek style if available 
1 tbsp curry powder 
2 tbsp olive oil 
garlic salt and pepper 

In a medium sized mixing bowl, combine yogurt, curry powder, and some garlic salt. Add in lamb and stir until coated. Cover and chill at least 24 hours. 30 minutes before cooking, remove lamb from fridge and let warm to room temperature. Cut eggplant into 1 inch cubes. In a large frying pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until it begins to expand. Add eggplant and cook, turning pieces every few minutes, until eggplant begins to soften. Add lamb with as much of the yogurt sauce as you can get into the pan. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, turning pieces over to make sure the outside of each piece is seared. In the meantime, cook couscous according to package directions. This should make 2 or more cups of cooked couscous. Set aside with the cover still on. Cut green beans into 2 inch lengths and add to the lamb. Stir in green beans, turning periodically, until they are crisp and bright green. Remove from heat and add couscous. Stir together, season to taste, and serve immediately. This will make four large portions. It will keep for several days in the fridge and is just as good cold as it is warm. 

I used a very mild curry powder and that worked really well. It is earthy and a little sweet. The whole wheat couscous holds the flavor better than the more delicate regular couscous and goes well with the hearty lamb. This might be one of my favorite things I have ever made."

"event","No word from my schools. I have reached a level of insanity that is totally new for me. I have made close to 100 pieces of jewelry in the last week, all in an effort to keep from checking the mailbox more than once a day. I even took a day off work to try to force myself to calm down. I used it to make more jewelry, walk to the bead store for more supplies to make even MORE jewelry, do dishes, cook, and snuggle with my&nbsp;poor sick boyfriend.&nbsp;It has not worked. I think I might have to resort to alcoholism and arson to calm the nerves.&nbsp;

Damn damn late mail!!!

On the plus side, my creative urges have increased. In addition to the jewelry, I have written almost every day and I am trying new recipes for dinner every night. Last night it was Jamaican Pork Kebabs, which were ""eh"". Tonight it was ""Down Home Chicken and Greens,"" which I highly recommend. Tomorrow will be lamb gyros with yogurt and roasted garlic. The lamb is marinating in a yogurt sauce as we speak and should be very tender come tomorrow evening. If it is good enough and I still have not heard from any schools, I might post the recipe.&nbsp;

Well, off to discuss D&amp;D and switch the laundry. Yippee!"

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Stream on Consciousness in the Morning"">Today is the fourth day in a row that I have not gone to work. Thankfully, Monday was a holiday and Tuesday and Wednesday were snow days, so today is the first one where I actually had to call in sick. It's crappy. My head feels like it it twice it's normal size. William had to go to work today, too, which doubly sucks. I no longer have someone to pamper me, bring me coffee, and tell me I look beautiful even when my head is twice it's normal size. Bugger...a five minute walk from coffee, still in my PJ's, and it's below freezing outside. I may have to settle for another six cups of tea. Seriously, if I have any more liquid I am going to just float away. In the last two days I have had 16 cups of tea, a whole bottle of juice, a bottle of water, and four kinds of soup. Bah! It would all be better if I had Norton's mom's magic Chinese medicine, which I can't find in the US. That shit was amazing. Two days and I could breathe well enough to play the flute...well, if I knew how to play the flute, which I don't. I bought something in Chinatown in San Francisco that looked right, but when I read the bottle later it said it had Ephedra. I was pretty surprised because I thought the FDA had banned Ephedra...you know that whole it causing strokes in young women thing...so, I tossed the bottle. Good thing too, as I am now miserable enough that I might have taken it anyway. And the worst part is that I am going home tomorrow morning. I better feel a lot healthier before I get on a 2 hour plane flight. At least my brother made it home from Antarctica safely...no minor miracle considering the boy's habit of finding the most dangerous thing you could possibly do and doing it. My poor mother! He actually told her about lashing himself to the boat during an arctic storm so that he could photograph it. Dork. I hope he's right in his predictions that in three years, when his movie goes public, he will make as much money as he thinks he's going to make. Then the whole family can retire, I can write for a living, and William can open his dark, brooding, hole-in-the-wall bar. Also, then I can to fly down to Australia whenever I want to get the glorious sinus infection beating magic pills. I am going back to bed. </div>"

6 cups of water or stock
1 can stewed tomatoes
1 can tomato paste
1 bag frozen corn
1 large carrot, cut into rounds
2 cups leftover turkey
4 cups loosely packhed swiss chard or other greens, torn into pieces
1 tbsp hot sauce
1 tsp ground corriander
1 tsp chili powder
Garlic salt and pepper

Put all ingredients except greens into a pot. Bring to a boil then simmer until carrots are tender. Add swiss chard, remove from heat, and serve. Cake! I have lunch for the week. Go me!"

"event","So, William and I started Capoeira today. It sucked. Or rather, it was a blast, but now that it is over, it sucks. I have not hurt this badly since I quit soccer and it isn't even the next morning, yet! I used muscles I was pretty sure I had lost in the war and forced my body into positions even God didn't think was possible. William hurts, too, but not as much. Of course, I am drinking water and off to a hot shower and about three hours of stretching. He is drinking beer and planning on a few rounds of computer combat. I wonder who will be worse off in the morning. 

My only consolation...this was HIS idea. 

Wait until Wednesday, when we have American Ballroom for beginners. That part was MY idea. 


I will be a size 6! I will, damn it! No matter how much it hurts tomorrow morning! (Someone please remind me I said that when 6am rolls around.)"

"event","We noticed water on the floor last night, but could not find its source. This morning, at 5:20 am, we found it. The molding around our window, the one right over the bed, is cracking. It was pouring outside and, incidentally, inside, as well. There was so much water coming through the wall that the blinds were humming. We pulled the bed away from the wall, put a towel on the windowsill, and went back to bed. We have now moved all the furniture, swept the floor, and called the property manager...again. He still hasn't fixed the leak in the closet, the faucet that screeches when you use hot water, or the periodically exploding toilet. Living in a century old house is exciting. Or is that the sleep dep talking?"

"event","I made it back to Portland, despite the second snow storm in Denver. I was, however, very well prepared for the cold weather. I was given five jackets for Christmas this year. William gave me a lovely high-performance black fleece and his mom gave me a soft furry grey fleece zip-up thingy, which is what I asked for. It wasn't until I got home that things got out of control. My mom, having only one child to focus her attentions on, could not make up her mind. She bought me three coats! Add to that the sweater, fleece vest, two long-sleeved shirts, and new gloves I got this year...well, it looks like I will be well prepared for any storm that may present itself!"

"event","Dear Cartoon and Animation Lovers,

I am going to brag. You have been warned. 

Tonight we met Bill Plympton. We got to see an hour and a half of his work, including some never before seen stuff. Then we got his autograph and a hand-done Guard Dog drawing. He put my name on mine. I also bought one of his compilation DVD's. 

We also got to meet and see some work from Spider Moccasin, a local cartoonist. 

It was SO FUN!"

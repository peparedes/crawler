"event","Do you ever wonder about all the pictures you must be in, that you don't know about?  All those times when you're someplace and see other people who, like you, are taking pictures?  Every now and then some random stranger in a picture of mine will make me wonder who they are, what they do, what their life is like.  One particular woman in Paris was especially captivating; she certainly had the whole <i>je ne sais quoi</i> thing down pat, a hint of a smile playing at the corners of her lips and her hair twisted up into that messy, I'm-not-trying-to-look-sexy-but-am-succeeding-wildly-anyway sort of chignon that Parisian women must be born knowing how to do.  Yep, chignon-twisting and scarf-tying, 2 areas where Parisian women may never be bested.  A man in Rome had dark Italian skin with eyes as almost painfully blue as a Siberian Husky.

What got me started thinking about this?  I saw a picture online earlier tonight.  It shows the waiting area in the Des Moines airport, and in the background, leaning against a pole, stands a blonde-haired girl wearing jeans and a black jacket.  She's pictured from behind, so that's almost all you can tell about her.  But she looks just like me, same height (mildly tallish - I'm 5'7""), same weight/body frame, same hair color and length.  I wore a black jacket that looks like the one pictured all through the winter and spring, and I'm certainly no stranger to the Des Moines airport.

Of course I have no way of ever knowing if that actually IS me in the picture, but it was strange nonetheless, to open a picture and immediately notice a background figure out of some sort of instinctual recognition.  Thinking that it might be me in the picture gave me an eerie feeling for absolutely no reason whatsoever, which then made me start thinking about the hundreds (and I don't think it would be a stretch to say possibly even thousands, if you consider all 27 years) of other people's pictures I'm most likely in."

"event","Although it would take a *complete* reversal of my usual politics to ever vote for a Republican president, I will give McCain a few (small) props after reading an article tonight that said that he, during a recent meet & greet at the Iowa State Fair, was ballsy enough to tell a bunch of Iowans that he does not support ethanol subsidies.  As an added bonus, he's said that he would veto the Farm Bill too.

So I like him just a little, or at least dislike him a teensy bit less, now.  We should NOT be subsidizing ethanol production, no sir.  For that matter, we shouldn't be heavily subsidizing corn and soybeans in general, but that'd be a very unpopular opinion for a politician to have."

"event","Sometimes, I really like being an Iowan.  Sweet corn season is one of those times!  We got a dozen ears of sweet corn with our CSA share this week. We weren't very hungry, so our dinner ended up being several ears of it + lots of green & yellow wax beans sauteed in a little butter and garlic + a sliced heirloom tomato.  I also brought a couple small slices of garlic focaccia home from work.  That's it, and that's all we needed.  There's other leftovers and things if we get hungry later.

Eating a dinner that pretty much consisted of nothing but vegetables tonight made me realize how much my tastes have changed since that entry I wrote 3 months ago in which I stated that I don't like vegetables - that I'm a fruit-lover, but have never cared for vegetables.  Now, I take that back entirely.  I love all sorts of vegetables and I have the CSA to thank for showing me how good they can be when they're grown locally and organically and picked just hours before they're given to you.  I particularly love sugar snap peas, carrots, broccoli, green beans, green onions, spinach, bell peppers, corn, sweet potatoes, you name it.  It's gotten to the point where if I go a day or two without some serious vegs, I start feeling all icky and craving them, seriously <i>craving</i> them!  I was worried at the beginning of the CSA that I'd be given a lot of stuff I wouldn't really know what to do with, or that I didn't like, but that hasn't been an issue at all.  So far the only thing that's gone to waste a little thus far has been a teensy amount of pac choi and a bit of cauliflower.

But Jeff and I both keep saying to each other how all this seasonal bounty will make this winter one of the most depressing ones ever.  You get used to eating this well, and this healthily, and then it all goes away and you're stuck buying Chilean blueberries or some such.  You feel guilty for buying produce that's ""covered in diesel"" and doesn't even taste very good anyway.  

In other news, our big Europe trip is sneaking right up on us at a quick pace.  We leave on September 15.  I emailed all the hotels tonight to reconfirm everything.  I then wasted a half-hour just browsing through pictures online of Amsterdam, the Swiss Alps, and Tuscany.  Hard to believe in no time at all, I'll be getting to see these places in person.  I'm very excited!  (and a bit stressed - there's still a small amount of planning to do + I need to do a little clothes shopping and make sure we both have comfy shoes for some light hiking.  This is the kind of stress I wouldn't mind having for the rest of my life, however!)"

"event","So Jeff and I have been sharing the 325i since 2 months ago when we had to turn the Z4 back in when its lease finished.  It hasn't always been easy sharing it, but the idea was to make it until after we get back from our Europe trip in October to buy another one (which would give us from now until then to use that money towards saving for the afore-mentioned trip).  Hell, just the insurance and plates alone for the Z4 was costing $100/mo!

But now, Jeff's 92 year old Grandma has finally decided to stop driving, bless her.  I mean, she's 92 and still insists on mowing her own lawn, raking leaves and picking up sticks, and walking to the grocery store for a loaf of bread every few days.  I admire her; everyone always tries to get her to take it easier, but not to be morbid, that's probably the reason she's still alive and in good health.  But it was time for her to renew her driver's license and she decided she wouldn't renew it after all.  She hardly drove anyway.  Her car is from 1995 and only has 27,000 miles on it, and it's always been garaged.  Knowing that we were down to one car, she offered to sell it to me for $500, which is absolutely a killer deal.  I could probably turn around and sell it for $1500 or more, but I won't of course.  

But it's an Oldsmobile - you know the kind - big, kinda ugly, Granny-ish.  Jeff couldn't believe that I'd want it and he almost turned the offer down without even asking me about it first, which shocked me.  He likes driving nice cars and would be embarassed to drive the Grannymobile, and so assumed that I'd be the same way.  Clearly, even after all these years, he still doesn't entirely know me.  Nice cars are great and all, but to be able to drive something in really good condition and not have any payment on it whatsoever (just cheap plates and liability-only insurance) is fantastic and I don't care how it looks!  I can be a lot more frugal than Jeff is - not that he's a spendthrift or anything.  He keeps telling me if we wanted to, we could afford a better 2nd car again, but I really don't care.  Why spend the money if we don't have to?  (Or at least for now, anyway... maybe after the trip, we'll reconsider.)  In the meantime, I'm reeeediculously excited about not having to share one car anymore, but without having a 2nd car payment.

Yay!"

How often do you find strawberries that are this red all the way through?  (And this pic doesn't even do them justice!)  Answer: not often!  They're too fragile to be transported easily - they were organic berries from our CSA and were some of the best I've had besides the ones in France.  I love June!

How much do I love homemade pasta?  A lot!  But I love my Kitchenaid mixer with its pasta attachments even more because it makes homemade pasta a possibility for weeknight dinners.  It only took 30 minutes of work to make the dough, roll out the pasta sheets, and get them all cut into fettuccine noodles!  The ""sauce"" was just butter, parmesan, and nutmeg.

"event","Oh my God am I tired.  And there's more family stuff going on tomorrow. (Luke's SO cute and sweet, but I don't feel like writing any more about the fam for now.) I slept quite fitfully last night, but I have a feeling that won't be a problem tonight.  Last night I couldn't turn my mind off long enough to get drowsy; tonight I think it's already been switched to the ""off"" position for the past several hours.

This weekend is a little tough for me, in more ways than one.  Tomorrow is Father's Day.  Father's Days always stink, along with my Dad's birthday (Feb 3) each year.  I wrote an entry a couple years ago that pretty much summed everything up - http://tara3056.livejournal.com/2006/06/06/ - but since then, things have only deteriorated to the point where my Dad and I aren't even in contact anymore.  The last time we spoke was nearly 2 years ago.  I did have to send Wally, my Mom's husband, a card though and I need to call him tomorrow as well.  It's not that I mind sending a card or calling - I care for Wally a lot - it's just that it's weird to do the whole Father's Day thing with him because my Mom and him only met and married 7 years ago, after I'd already moved away.  So I've definitely never thought of Wally as my step-Dad, but he's sentimental and I know it means a lot to him that I at least act like I think of him in that way.  He has to have neurosurgery sometime in the next month, and I know it's scaring him and my Mom (me, too).

Ok, off to bed now... fingers crossed for no more mind-racing or icky dreams, just sweet blissful sleep!"

The flooding is still crazy.  I feel so fortunate that we haven't been directly impacted by it, but I feel so badly for those who have been.  Jeff's building downtown was evacuated yesterday.  He walked down to Court Avenue and the bridges and said the water level was even higher than he'd thought it'd be.  Other parts of the state are worse off than we are; there's going be millions upon millions of dollars worth of structural damage, not to mention all the crops that have been/will be lost.  We didn't get our CSA box last week because the farmer was literally trapped on the farm.  And the tornado that killed the 4 Boy Scouts ... what a shame (to say the least).  This has been a very dramatic season thus far.

On the bright side, it's looking like a beautiful day - for now."

"event","(Aren't Britishisms fun?)  I went on a total cleaning binge, and have spent the last, oh, 7 hours straight scrubbing and sweeping, dusting and vacuuming, mopping and cleaning all the windows, doing laundry and ironing.  Nuts.  For those who may not know, I have just a *hint* of OCD to my personality.  I keep a pretty clean house anyways, but we've been so busy lately that it was past due for a good cleaning - and the problem is, I can't ever stop with just one thing or one room.  If I sweep, I have to mop.  If I vacuum, I'm itching to dust.  If I windex one mirror, I want to do them all (and tonight, the windows too).  And the same with individual rooms - I can't clean just one room; I have to keep going and going.  Sometimes I am able to stop myself at just doing the upper level and ignoring the family room downstairs until another day.  *sigh*

What's more pathetic is that I seriously get off on having a freshly-cleaned house.  I don't necessarily like the actual process of cleaning it, but when it's all finished, I am a grinning and very satisfied woman.

We got our stimulus check today.  Woo hoo.  Stupid fucking Bush.  But I'll happily stick it in the savings account for the worst of all possible uses - to give it to Europe during our fall trip.

Our first CSA pickup is tomorrow too, so that's exciting.  I'm getting a veg & fruit share, but passed on the herb share.  They're so easy to grow it's silly not to, if you use a lot of fresh herbs in your cooking.  I was happy to find some organic Genovese basil seeds a couple weeks ago.  Apparently Genovese basil is the best for pesto and lots of other things, but it will be a long time before the plants get big enough for me to harvest.  

Jeff's brother Mark and his wife Monica are coming for a visit in a couple weeks and it will be our first time meeting Luke, their 9 month old son... should be interesting.  (Says the woman who formerly disliked kids and wasn't sure if she'd ever want them, but now is curious to see if her biological clock will shift into a higher gear after hanging out with her nephew.)

"event","Things I like(d):

- First and foremost, free internet access provided by a better-than-expected hotel (so, yes, I'm still in CA ... Half Moon Bay now, actually)
- Riding the cable cars up and over San Francisco's notoriously steep hills instead of hoofing it everywhere.  By Day #2, our leg muscles were pretty sore, but 2 main cable car lines stopped right by our hotel.
- Priceline.  They hooked us up with a hotel in SF in a great location (Nob Hill) for $100/night (taxes and all).  If you know anything about SF prices, you'll know that's a steal.  The hotel isn't very well reviewed online, with lots of complaints that the 100-year old building smells ""old"" or that the rooms are cramped, and so forth.  I'm not that picky, and at $100/night, I was pretty pleased overall.  The Sonoma hotel was friggin gorgeous, all mission-style, with a soaking tub with a view and separate shower.  Yay Priceline.
- The weather being over 60 degrees.  That's me trying to be positive.  Someone out here said it was the coolest Spring they've had in nearly 30 years and it would normally be in the 70s, but instead, the Bay breeze made it downright chilly for most of the time, and haze kind of hung in the air so much that we missed out on some amazing views.
- SF (and CA in general I'm guessing) is so damn liberal.  I love it.  Everywhere you go, people are recycling.  People use reusable shopping sacks.  Gay people can be out and proud in public.  People vote and pass laws here that would never get passed in Iowa.  People care about the environment and the sustainability of their food, and they like buying local, seasonal, and organic when possible.  Raw milk is sold in supermarkets.  This list could go on forever.  
- Wine tasting... mmm...  and more wine-tasting... Yesterday and today were our Napa/Sonoma days and I cannot tell you how fabulous it felt to be sitting on the terrace at Domaine Carneros today with the sun warming my shoulders, looking out over the hilly vineyards below, sipping a flight of wines and nibbling on a cheese plate.
- Good food, good food, good food, good food.  Scratch all that; make it GREAT food.  Transcendent food.  Food that falls into the never-forget-until-the-day-I-die category.  I must warn anyone reading that I WILL be rambling about food stuff for a minute.  I'm admittedly kind of a foodie, but not in a fancy-food-only sense.  More like, if it tastes great, I don't care whether it's 50 cents or 50 bucks.  I'm more Chowhound than Saveur, if that makes sense.  In terms of travel, if we're going someplace that isn't known for having great food, I don't worry about it and just enjoy all the other things a place has to offer (Amsterdam would be one good example of this)... I don't make restaurant reservations, I don't care that much about what we eat.  Food becomes the fuel that allows us to enjoy the great museums, or scenery, or whatever.  But, if I'm going to a place that IS known for its fabulous food, I definitely take advantage of it and spend a good bit of time planning for that aspect of the trip.  I love lingering over a 2 hour long meal at the end of a day.  I love the European habit of eating dinner late, and find that sitting across the table and chatting about the day and what we want to do next is so relaxing and luxurious.

A cut to be polite... <lj-cut>

What haven't I liked?
- Traffic
- San Francisco public transportation.  It's confusing and not nearly as well-oiled / efficient as the kind of systems you find in Paris or London.
- Those damn SF hills.  Ow.
- The Golden Gate Bridge creeps me out.  There I said it.  It's beautiful to be sure, but ever since I saw a show/read more about the many suicide jumpers who jump over the low barrier to the water below, I haven't looked at it the same.  It's a little morbid for me.  And one lady who wrote an article about the bridge said that it ""speaks"" to people, that it can tell them to jump, and that just creeped me out more because I just knew if I tried to walk across it, it would start morbidly whispering in my ear too.  Don't get me wrong; I'm not depressed at all.  I am however very scared of heights and got vertigo even when descending the stairs of Notre Dame and the Pyramid of the Sun outside Mexico City.  When I look down over the edge of something, I start getting tunnel vision and something just seems to want to pull me down.   So I didn't 'like' the Golden Gate Bridge because I couldn't bring myself to cross it in the first place!
- Alcatraz.  Kind of overpriced for what we got to see.  Gloomy and verrrry cold weather that day too.
- Flying.  I hate flying.  Jeff is always amused to watch me during take-offs, landings, and turbulence.  I hold it together outwardly pretty well, but he can read the look in my eyes and feel my fingertips digging into his arm or knee.  He's had aerospace engineering classes and knows all about why and how planes fly.  He explains it to me, and I'm not stupid, but always in the back of my irrational mind, I breathe a sigh of relief when I'm back on terra firma and think ""we just weren't <i> meant </i> to do that!""  Of course, we weren't ""meant"" to drive a car either, really, but fear is not rational.

Ok, I'm going to close for now.  Honestly I've been internet-deprived for so long (yes, a week is a long time to me; I'm addicted) that this super-long entry is probably just a manifestation of how happy I was to have it back tonight.  Gluttony in a different form."

"event","I grilled bison burgers for dinner - it was my first time eating bison, and I have to say I really liked it!  Better than ground beef, definitely.  The healthier aspect is just another bonus.  I'll probably stick with bison only from now on if I'm planning on making burgers, and will probably try it in chili and other recipes that usually call for ground beef.  To me, it tastes a lot like beef, but ""beefier"" if that makes any sense.  More robust tasting, yet leaner.  Not ""gamey"" at all.

For me, bison really is the only other red meat besides beef that I like.  I don't care for venison at all (and yes, I've had it several times), and though I'm somewhat of an adventurous eater/wannabe foodie, I absolutely despise lamb (and yes, I've had it prepared verrrry well by a Michelin-starred restaurant and still hate it... except on gyros, but only if mixed with beef and smothered in tzatziki).

I also love rabbit and saw some at our local gourmet market so I'll have to look into recipes.  I'd like to cut back a bit on my beef consumption, but I'm not going to try overly hard.  Technically it would be healthier to not eat so much beef, but it's also somewhat of a moral issue.  It's incredibly easy to find free-range organic chicken these days and bison are always grass-fed and never given any hormones, but finding grass-fed, ethically-raised and slaughtered beef and pork is more difficult.  

Jeff doesn't eat pork (he's missing out!), so I usually don't either unless it's at a restaurant.  He says it's because he grew up here in Iowa and has been around hog lots and has seen the impact they have on the environment/drinking water/etc.  Not to mention they're usually kept in a tiny pen with no exercise and roll around in their own filth.  I see where he's coming from, but I always question why he only refuses pork, not chicken or beef?  (And then I catch myself, well aware that if I push too much, he might think of turning vegetarian on me.)  Chickens and cows are raised in much the same way... I think if he really thought about it, he'd want to quit eating meat altogether.  I don't think he'd be able to because he enjoys having me prepare our (meat-inclusive) meals and I wouldn't know what to do with myself if I were faced with cooking only veggies.  I ... don't like veggies.  There, I said it.

I love spinach and other greens and eat lots of salads.  I like tomatoes and corn and potatoes (but it's arguable how healthy those are), and that's just about it.  Green beans, occasionally.  Carrots, occasionally.  But I hate peas and all types of beans except green beans, and all other veggies are just alright at best.  I'd have an incredibly difficult time giving up meat.  Partially because I think humans were meant, by nature, to eat meat, and partially because I just friggin' love the taste of it.  I get cravings for it.  (Jeff never, ever gets cravings for meat - or strong cravings for anything, really.)  Some people love veggies but don't care for many fruits, and vice versa.  I'm a fruit freak.  I make up for a lack of veggie consumption by eating lots of fruits and supplementing with a multivitamin.  On the weekends, we make fruit smoothies; we usually have some sort of fruit with dinner each night; I eat a cup or two of (thawed) blueberries every single day.  If given the choice, I'd usually take a fruit-based dessert over something heavier (except when the occasional chocolate craving kicks into high gear).  I find apples and grapes pretty boring and don't eat as many of them as other sorts, but generally, never get sick of eating a ton of fruit.

But back to meat and morals.  I like to be an educated consumer and I've seen photos and videos of conditions at farms and slaughterhouses; I've read Fast Food Nation and was pretty disgusted by it.  But if giving up meat is simply NOT an option for me, then I at least try to support ethical/local producers.  If an animal is going to die so I can eat it, I'd at least like to know that, for the time it was alive, it wasn't cooped up in some tiny pen with atrophying muscles, skin sores, and lying in its own excrement.  When I was young, my Dad raised chickens, a few pigs, and some cows.  After being around chickens, eating them really doesn't bother me.  They're little, and dirty, and stupid (no offense to any chickens who may be reading ;)).  Cows and pigs, though... much smarter.  And I think the more intelligent an animal is, the more guilt I feel.

I'd love to hear back from anyone who cares to comment:  Are you a fruit person, veggie-lover, or purely meat-and-potatoes kind of eater?  Do ethical issues ever come into play when choosing which foods you eat?

I don't go out of my way to buy organic fruit, with a couple exceptions, but when given the chance will always choose free-range/organic eggs and chicken, and like to support local suppliers when possible.  I'm also a bit of a stickler over artificial and 'natural' favors (which aren't so natural after all) and don't like consuming a lot of high fructose corn syrup - stuff is evil.  I will purchase and defend real butter, whole milk, heavy cream, full-fat cream cheese, and real sugar until the day I die."

"event","I've had killer insomnia lately and I'm just absolutely dragging right now... can't think of doing the laundry I'd planned to do, can't imagine cooking (frozen leftovers for us tonight).  Just want to sleep.  But yet I know whenever I actually get in bed, I'll just lie there exhausted but unable to sleep nonetheless.

I read a rant by Anthony Bourdain about Rachael Ray, though, and that cracked me up at least:

""Complain all you want. It's like railing against the pounding surf. She only grows stronger and more powerful. Her ear-shattering tones louder and louder. We KNOW she can't cook. She shrewdly tells us so. So...what is she selling us? Really? She's selling us satisfaction, the smug reassurance that mediocrity is quite enough. She's a friendly, familiar face who appears regularly on our screens to tell us that ""Even your dumb, lazy ass can cook this!"" Wallowing in your own crapulence on your Cheeto-littered couch you watch her and think, ""Hell...I could do that. I ain't gonna...but I could -- if I wanted! Now where's my damn jug a Diet Pepsi?"" Where the saintly Julia Child sought to raise expectations, to enlighten us, make us better -- teach us -- and in fact, did, Rachael uses her strange and terrible powers to narcotize her public with her hypnotic mantra of Yummo and Evoo and Sammys. ""You're doing just fine. You don't even have to chop an onion -- you can buy it already chopped. Aspire to nothing...Just sit there. Have another Triscuit..Sleep...sleep...""

Bwah!  I loves me some Bourdain, though not nearly so much as Gordon Ramsay.  (And for the record, the BBC/UK version of Kitchen Nightmares is so, so, SO much better than the overly-dramatic US version that I never bother watching.  BBC, in general, rocks.)"

"event","My Mom, who never buys anything online, made me buy her a weight loss through hypnosis DVD.  Okaaaayyyyyyy.  I guess she hasn't started that yet, but she's on day 3 or 4 of ""The Dolly Parton diet"" which is also apparently known as the Cabbage Soup diet.  First, I don't get why attaching Dolly Parton's name to a diet would make anyone want to do it.  The woman looks freakish.  Second, just look at this diet...

It starts by making a cabbage/vegetable soup that's amped up with some Lipton Onion Soup packets.  You can eat as much of the soup that you want, on any day.  But other than the soup, you have to follow these guidelines for a week:

DAY 1: Only fruits with the exception of bananas. 

DAY 2: Only vegetables, raw or cooked. This includes baked potato with a LITTLE butter. 

DAY 3: Fruits and vegetables, but no potatoes or bananas. 

DAY 4: Only bananas and skim milk--eat as many as 8 bananas and drink as many as 8 glasses of skim milk. 

DAY 5: Beef, skinless chicken, and/or fish--as much as 20 ounces, total. You can also eat 6 tomatoes. And you must drink 8 glasses of water. Don't forget at least one bowl of soup. 

DAY 6: Beef, skinless chicken, or fish and vegetables. Drink 8 glasses of water and eat at least one bowl of soup. 

DAY 7: Brown rice, vegetables, and unsweetened fruit juice. 

------------

I swear that looks like one of the more crackhead diets I've seen.  Bananas are evil one day and all you eat 3 days later?  And people talk about the ""fat-burning"" soup like it has magical properties.  I mean, seriously.  If you eat a soup that consists mostly of water and then eat nothing but fruit and veggies, YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE WEIGHT!  It isn't necessarily healthy and it will most likely come back immediately after you stop the diet, but hey, I guess short-term results is what's important??  Mom and I were talking on the phone tonight and she mentioned how hungry she's been... gee, I wonder why??  She claims she only needs to drop a few pounds this week in order to ""jump start"" her for continuing to eat better and weaning herself off carbs.  Lord, she's bought into the whole carbs-are-evil thing too now?  

I dunno, I mean, personally I think you can and should eat just about anything you want *in moderation* and that carbs are most certainly not evil.  Have you seen the old food pyramid - remember what the bottom ""step"" of the pyramid was?  The step that formed the largest percentage of your daily diet with 6-11 servings per day?  That's right - carbs.  I tried to explain to her that losing weight is a simple issue of caloric intake.  If you need 1800 calories a day to function and you only eat 1500 a day, you will slowly lose weight (slowly is the key word there), and if you eat over 1800 a day, you will slowly gain it.  Those 1800 (just an example #) calories can come from friggin ice cream and nothing else if you want and you still won't gain weight if you don't exceed 1800 total calories in a day.  You won't be healthy, mind you - over time you'll become a skinny person setting yourself up for heart disease, but you know, still skinny.  Le sigh.

I really hope I never have a serious weight problem because I totally lack the willpower to stick to one of these fad-type diets.  I mean, I'm taking nasty prednisolone and sure enough, it's caused me to gain a few pounds of - presumably - water weight (not to mention my skin isn't as happy as usual), but ain't no way in hell you'll find me knocking back bananas and skim milk next week when I'm no longer taking these nasty pills.

""Tara, I swear I ate a TON of grapes, like a whole bag from the grocery store, and I was still starving that night!""  *slaps forehead*"

"event","Have been invited to a wedding near Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco.  We had been playing with the idea of using our frequent flyer miles for a free trip to Washington DC, and that would have been a particularly cheap trip because in addition to the free flights, the Smithsonian museums and most of the other things we'd want to do are also free + Priceline is great for DC hotels. 

But now I'm glad we haven't made plans for that since this wedding invitation just arrived.  A trip to San Francisco would be much more expensive than DC - we'd still use our miles for the flight, but hotels are insanely expensive in that area (and it isn't as good of a city for Priceline) + the attractions aren't free + a 3-4 day trip was ideal for DC, but we'd need 6-7 for this one + the FOOD!!!!!!

I'm not quite in The French Laundry league (nor could I get reservations if I were!), but you would not be able to get me on the plane back to Iowa without a meal at Chez Panisse Cafe at the very least.  And possibly Bouchon out in Napa.  In fact, I'm thinking this could be a much cooler trip than DC.  The natural beauty of the area is without question, the food is fab, *and* we can be good friends and show up for Corey's big day.  Definitely an interesting idea, and one I'll need to decide on quickly if I want those FF tix!"

2.  Go here.  Laugh.  Maybe I was just in a weird mood when I first read this, but I was seriously laughing so hard I had to stop and catch my breath.  Then again, I do occasionally have a strange sense of humor...

3.  On a more somber note, if any of you haven't seen Randy Pausch's ""Last Lecture"" it really is worth watching.  The unabridged version is way longer than the little clips other websites have, but is much better too.  I know word/videos of this lecture spread over the internet like wildfire, but just in case you haven't heard about it...

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5700431505846055184

4.  And now for something not so awesome.  Because it is my journal and I don't always have to be PC in MY journal... In browsing the web looking for hints about how to vary the baking time of lasagna when using freshly homemade pasta sheets (which I made, and which was YUM) and whether I had to boil the sheets before layering up the lasagna, I encountered a post in a woman's blog... it answered my lasagna question, but as I glanced over her various pages, I felt more and more squicky and uncomfortable but couldn't resist looking at her ""Bring Him Home"" page: http://www.happyhousewifery.com/connie/bring-him-home.html

I don't really know what to say about that, but further research revealed that there's a whole movement of women who have ""surrendered"" to their husbands (partly based on a book called The Surrendered Wife - *puke*) and who view housewifery and being submissive as a very spiritual thing.  It's just... *shudder*  I've also read pages where wives were encouraged to have sex with their husbands anytime their husbands want it, even if the woman didn't want to at all, because that's our god-given duty.  Ewwwwww.  (I wonder if those men/women care whether or not the woman has an orgasm?  And if they don't care, then clearly they've never known the joy of being with a woman who really and truly loves sex.)

I'm happy to live in a place where we can believe whatever we wish to believe, and I wouldn't change that, even if it meant I could make things that make me uncomfortable magically disappear.  But for me, personally, I don't think I've read so many pages that had me widening my eyes and shuddering in a long time.  Ew, ew, ew.

5.  But, here's some submissiveness I can get behind:  Finally got around to watching the movie 'Secretary' recently.  Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader were great, and the movie was extremely quirky but I liked it.  I'm pretty much over the (slight) interest in bdsm I used to have, but there's a couple scenes in Secretary that are still daaamn hot.  But only in context.  Out of context, if I stumbled across them while flipping channels, it would have made me giggle uncomfortably, but in context, they did a nice job with it.  I also don't remember the last time I've seen such a convincing ugly-duckling-into-swan transformation (re: Maggie's character).  Most swan movies start with a pretty girl we're supposed to believe is ugly because of bad clothes or no makeup and end with the pretty girl made prettier.

One of the reviews for Secretary said that it wasn't a date movie unless you wanted to have a uncomfortable date in which you both shift nervously the whole time.  I'd agree with that - it would be a horrible date movie.  It's mildly sexually deviant and it's a very dark comedy.  So, be warned, if you haven't already seen it and you want to, don't watch it with anyone else unless you're really comfortable with that person!"

"event","Someone backed into our car *again* ... GRRRRRRRRR.  Last time this happened was a few months ago.  Jeff and I had thought to make a late-night run to McDonalds to grab an ice cream cone (yeah it sucks, but it was the only thing open at 1am) and while we were waiting to order, the driver of the huge pick-up truck in front of us decides he doesn't want to wait in the drive-through any longer, throws the truck into reverse, and BAM, slams his ball hitch straight into our car.  He hit us so hard that the damage went beyond the bumper and into the steel itself, requiring an expensive repair which was happily a fairly easy process thanks to his insurance company.  

The more recent time was Friday night.  Jeff was on his way home from work.  It was around 8pm and he stopped at a red light at the intersection he uses to get on the interstate.  The woman in front of him, coincidentally driving a big ass SUV, didn't know where she was going and decided she needed out of the turn lane.  She went into reverse so she could switch lanes, and BAM, hit our car - which had been sitting right behind her with its lights on for at least a minute.

Now if this were happening with our tiny little Z4, which sits really low to the ground, I could understand it better, given that both idiots were in large ass vehicles.  But it wasn't with the Z4.  It was with the 325i, which sits as high off the ground as any other car, and also happens to be the car we actually own, not the one we're leasing.  So there's really no excuse except that, apparently, that whole maneuver that was pummeled into some of us when we were first learning to drive  - wherein you actually look over your shoulder *before* reversing instead of relying only on your mirrors - is not actually practiced by a subset of Iowan idiots.  Grr."

"event","One of Jeff's coworkers asked him, ""What does your wife want for Valentine's Day?""  Jeff replied that I'd said I didn't want anything.  Simultaneously, his coworkers looked at each other and said, ""Uh oh, you're in trouble...""  Jeff asked why, and they *both* replied, ""because that means she wants diamonds!""

He related this story to me, and I laughed.  When he tried to convince them that I really don't care about this drippy, manufactured holiday, they still didn't believe him.  But I don't.  I still have some Pierre Marcolini chocolate stashed away, and no chocolate Jeff could find in this area could possibly compete.  I hate roses, especially red ones.  They die too quickly and don't actually smell like anything anymore (which is why my favorite flowers are Oriental lilies).  I gag at overly-sentimental cards and would murder anyone who bought me a stuffed animal.  

That said, I don't mind using this artificial holiday as an excuse to have a really nice night.  So on Saturday, I'm renting a movie and then I'm going to cook us a meal that's substantially more expensive than what I usually make, though still much cheaper than going out to eat (wild mushroom risotto to start, then filet au beurre rouge, chocolate fondants for dessert, and a bottle of damn good Amarone wine), and I'm going to cook it while wearing high heels, black stockings, and my new teal-and-black corset.  Because, really, how often can you get away with a stunt like that??"

"event","On the weekends and on some evenings, if I don't have too much else going on, I've been baking a lot lately.  I'm completely self-taught but I decided to at least start *trying* to make some things that have intimidated me for a long time.  Until a couple months ago, I'd never made pie crust from scratch.  Now I'm turning out really tasty crusts (and now I understand why everyone says homemade crust really does make a difference and tastes better than store-bought) for use on pies or quiches.  Quiche is one of those things that I'm convinced has gotten a bad rap for far too long.  When done properly, it's light and fluffy, not dense and dry, doesn't really taste like eggs, and is delicious.  I love a bacon, gruyere, and parmesan quiche the best so far.

I can bake homemade bread now, and that's really rewarding, and a couple nights ago I even made handmade pasta!  I don't have a pasta machine so I just made it Bologna-style, with nothing but flour and eggs, rolled out by hand and cut into tagliatelle strips.  I dressed it really simply with butter, parmesan, and freshly ground pepper, and it was far better than its simple ingredients would suggest.

And now I'm getting ideas together for our Valentines dinner.  We don't usually do much for V-Day, being both pretty cynical about the whole thing, but I do try to cook us an extra-special meal and we pop open a bottle of champagne.  Soooooo, I've just finished making some strawberry tartlets.  I used strawberries because they were the only thing that looked pretty decent at the grocery store, but I think raspberries would taste and look even better.  I'm looking forward to summer fruit, and for it being my first time, I think they turned out rather well....!

"event","Quotes from yesterday:  After the surgery, the doc says ""the cracking noises were pretty bad, huh?  I bet you're wishing you had the IV?""  Me:  ""Anyone who needs an IV for that is a pussy!""  I couldn't talk very well AT ALL, but judging by the look on his face, he apparently got the gist of what I said.  Then, upon the nurse showing me my teeth before I left: ""Wow, look at those fuckers!"" (she cracked up)  I don't usually have a potty mouth in public, but I guess the Xanax lowered my inhibitions.  It wouldn't have been the nitrous because I didn't feel a thing from that, nothing - it could have been plain oxygen for all I know.  I'd told the nurse I'd had a bad experience with it before, with hallucinations and nausea, and asked her to keep it turned down kind of low, and I think it ended up being too low, but I was fine.

I honestly think I'm having the easiest recovery I've ever heard of with wisdom teeth - but I won't be out of the woods entirely until I'm past the time frame to get a dry socket (reeeallly trying to avoid that!)  The bleeding stopped (mostly - still a tiiiiny bit of seepage from time to time) after 5-6 hours yesterday and I only took Tylenol w/ Codeine 2x even though I wasn't really having any pain - the doc told me to take it before I started feeling pain, as it apparently works better that way.  But I haven't taken so much as an Advil today and am just fine.  A little sore, yes, and I can only eat soft foods and still have somewhat of a metallic taste in my mouth from the blood/scabs/whatever.  Overall though, I keep wanting to pinch myself because I can't believe I can have 4 huge teeth taken out all at one whack and feel this good.  I've been taking it easy today, watching movies and stuff.  Jeff and I both go back to work on Monday and I should be fine by then.  I won't be able to eat normally for a couple weeks and am not sure when the slight soreness will go away, but overall?  This was seriously the easiest thing ever, so far.

No dry socket, no dry socket, no dry socket, no dry socket...."

"event","Xanax was verrrrrry very nice to me last night and today, as was Nitrous gas, as is codeine currently.  Haven't had to resort to anything stronger than codeine, though I do have some Demerol around (not sure, actually, which one is stronger).  It pretty much sucked, as anticipated, but I'm so damn glad I didn't get the IV.  I had a nice breakfast today and after actually going through with the extractions and feeling the pressure/hearing the cracking noises and such, I honestly don't understand why anyone would feel the need to be knocked out in order to handle it - I didn't think the actual procedure would be that bad, and it wasn't.  Recovery is yet to be seen. 

In any case I'm doing as well as could be expected at the moment.  Sore and hungry and tired and bloody, but okay.  Please don't let me get a dry socket... please don't let me get a dry socket, don't let me get a dry socket, don't let me get a dry socket."

"event","I'm having all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow  You may remember an entry from a long time ago caterwauling over how nervous I am about this.  Well, the nervousness/dread hasn't lessened any, but the day is finally here and I've nearly come to terms with the idea that, tomorrow, I will be voluntarily putting myself in a lot of pain. (That's the most fucked up part - I'm doing this to myself! The wisdoms are all in, none impacted, and they all came in straight. Which makes it even more absurd-feeling that I'm getting them removed, only because I can't take care of them as well as I should since they're too far back in my mouth, and that might cause big problems later on.)

I'm not scared of the surgery; I'm not scared of needles in and of themselves. I just can't stand the thought of an IV (because, unlike a needle, it stays in you the whole time and the idea of drugs running directly into my vein squicks me out like no other), so I've decided *not* to have one. I'll be using a nice Xanax pill + nitrous ""laughing gas"" for my nerves + local shots in my mouth for the pain. Some people have acted like I'm crazy to not take the IV, but what they may not realize is that the IV wouldn't contain any painkiller anyhow - only sedative to make you calm. You'd still get the local shots in the mouth to numb everything, so if I'm most phobic of the IV itself, why would I accept it to calm me down?? I've had extractions before, when I was younger, and the pressure and cracking noises aren't pleasant, but I can handle the thought of that much better than an IV. (One day I know I'll have to face my IV fear, but that day doesn't have to be tomorrow.)

The other thing I dread is the taste of blood. I hate the taste of blood. Brings me right back to all those extractions as a kid (I think I had 8, 2 were permanent teeth). Nuff said on that. And I'm going to be crossing my fingers that whatever painkiller they prescribe after-the-fact won't make me puke all over the place, because Vicodin has made my head spin most unpleasantly once before. The good news is that if I refuse the IV, I can actually eat a nice breakfast tomorrow! I wasn't looking forward to starving *before* they even fuck up my mouth.

So cross your fingers for me that I come through this without *too* much pain, without getting a dry socket, and without some massively bad experience that leads to future PTSD! In the meantime, tonight I'm cooking for myself - some creamy tomato-basil soup, super-soft mac & cheese, and baked carrots. Jeff will be working from home tomorrow and Friday so he can take care of me.  The fridge is stocked with tons of other soft foods; the bed is freshly made; I've got lots of Netflix movies and magazines to read. And perhaps another Xanax for later tonight.  Goooooood Xanaxxxxx."

"event","When I was in TN, I got to hang out with my brother (Josh) for a couple days - he told me a little about how he and his friend Corey were getting little gigs in Charlotte, but I didn't know exactly what they were doing now.  Josh has been in a couple other bands before, but now he's just doing this thing with Corey where they take hip-hop/R&B songs and cover them, changing them into guitar-based songs.  He always said he'd never cover other people's songs, but he's apparently getting a lot of entertainment out of this.  Not to mention a lot of girls.  I swear, you wouldn't even know my brother and I are related; he is *such* a pimp!

So he sends me an email today directing me to their Myspace to hear some songs and stuff.  Oh, oh, dear.  The band name is... Pussy Fireball (wtf?) and they've got songs by T-Pain and Justin Timberlake up.  Some of the songs aren't that amusing to me, but it's hilarious to hear a white boy singing ""Imma buy you a drink...""  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rSzJfTjLc

The funny part is that it is all verrry tongue-in-cheek, including their pictures, but doesn't he look all pimp? (He's the dark-haired one.)

"event","We're hanging out at my Mom's house with 25 of my extended relatives, all of whom are ""country people"" from Tennessee.  Already I've had to deal with listening to my uncle Dean playing Christian hymns on the guitar (""Happy Birthday, Jesus"") and one of my aunts getting completely wasted.  Then again, maybe my aunt is on to something.  Josh, Jeff, and I have all just decided that drinking will help us cope on this very merry Christmas Day.  So my kickass brother is making me a Jack & Coke as I type this.

How the hell did I come from this family??!

Merry Christmas to you all."

"event","So, as I mentioned in a previous entry, I've managed to do the nigh-impossible:  Score amazing frequent flyer tickets to Europe, at a decent time of year, with good departure/layover/arrival times, all for the bare minimum award level of 50k ff miles.  Thank you, Northwest!!  (Neither Jeff or I actually managed to rack up 50k miles by flying - we got a lot by flying; our last trip to Europe alone gave us 8k, but mostly it was because we each accepted a credit card offer that gave you 25,000 miles just for signing up + 1 mile per dollar spent thereafter.  So when we were in Europe in May-June, we put everything on that card and just paid it off as soon as we got back, charged some more groceries and things, and voila, 50k miles each!)

So next September, NWA is flying us from Des Moines to Amsterdam, where we'll have a lovely 3 day stopover before they fly us on to Zurich, Switzerland, and then they'll eventually fly us home from Pisa, Italy.  The plan is to enjoy Amsterdam, then go straight from the morning flight to Zurich onto a scenic train (glass sides + tops) that will take us to the Bernese Oberland area (goooorgeous) where we'll play in the Alps for 4 or 5 days before taking a train down to Tuscany.  We plan on spending 3 days in Florence and probably 6 more basing ourselves in some gorgeous little Tuscan hilltown and using a rental car to explore different villages and gape at the scenery every day.  All in all, the trip will be 2.5 weeks long.  Not a month like last time, but still enough time to get over the jet lag and see a lot and enjoy ourselves.  Plus there's a nice mix of old and new.  We've been to Amsterdam before (and adored it), but haven't been to Switzerland at all, and though we've been to Italy, we didn't go to Florence or Tuscany.

Sometimes people seem surprised that we're able to do all this travelling... while it's true that Jeff makes a decent salary, it's also all about priorities.  One of Jeff's coworkers said he was jealous yesterday, that he and his family are only going to Disneyland next year.  But when they compared the cost of a Disneyland vacation to the cost of a Europe vacation, surprisingly, the European vacation will cost the same or even *less* money per day.  Airfare is often the big expense, and in this case, we only had to cover the taxes on our fares (which, if we'd had to pay for them, would have been pretty expensive.  The going rate right now is $3200 for 2 people, but airfares will likely drop a bit between now and then).  Anyways, back to what I was saying about priorities:  neither of us buys a single thing, even a $20 item, without usually telling the other one first; I cook a lot so we don't eat out that often; we didn't spend much on Christmas this year; we live in a house that's easily within our means; in general, when we prioritize things, travel tops our list.

It's a little bit sad for me to be planning a European trip that doesn't include France.  I still want to do a driving tour of the south of France (Dordogne & Provence) one day, but it may not happen for a long time.  Jeff and I are both kind of thinking that this may be our last big hurrah before we start getting serious about starting a family, which will change absolutely everything.  I am so glad, though, that we've had this time together on our own - it's the only reason we've been able to do so much.

Anyway, after I got the FF tix all confirmed and everything, I literally squealed and did a little jumpy-dance, so I had to write about it here.  I always like having something on the long-horizon to look forward to.  It makes the dreary, dark, and cold winter days just a little less bleak."

"event","Jeff and I are wrapping presents tonight - or rather, Jeff is wrapping presents while I just make out the nametags and provide moral support... this because I apparently can't wrap presents.  I am not a good present-wrapper.  My corners are messy and my folds are uneven and it really doesn't bother me, but it bothers Jeff so he wraps all the presents so he can ensure that they are the most perfectly wrapped presents possible.  I've tried to tell him (to no avail) that no one actually looks at the wrap job before tearing into them on Xmas day, but he doesn't believe me.  If it sounds like I'm complaining about this weirdly anal behavior of his, I'm not, not at all.  It means I don't have to wrap presents!

I put in a Christmas music CD to ""get us in the mood"".  That lasted for all of three songs before I'd had enough.  I had to put in some u2 to fix the grumpiness that set in within those 3 songs.  I'd forgotten how much I really love early u2 - well, all u2 really, but the early stuff like ""I Will Follow"" and ""New Year's Day"" just puts a smile on my face.  (I should have known a previous relationship would never work as soon as he told me that he disliked u2.)

I've come thisclose to giving Jeff his presents tonight.  I'm horrible about surprises, getting them or giving them - I hate them!  As a kid, I would sneak under the Christmas tree late at night and gently slice open my packages along the tape-lines, peek inside (which didn't work if the present was in a generic brown box, but worked often enough to pay off), and then re-tape right over where the old tape was so that it never looked like it'd been touched.  Pathetic.  As an adult, I mostly buy my own Christmas gifts, which usually suits me fine.  But I still try to surprise Jeff with a few things.  This year we agreed to go easy on the gifts to each other.  I already got to go to Mexico City as a sort of early Christmas present and we're also trying to start saving for our next Europe trip (more on that later), but I couldn't resist getting him stuff.  Some of it is clothes and shoes (he really needed some new stuff, and I'm always the one that dresses him, which I love doing), but there's a couple fun things in there too, and I know he'll adore me for them and I'm dying to give them to him already!

We're opening presents with his family on Saturday and then driving down to Tennessee on Sunday, to spend Christmas with my family.  We'll probably be down there for New Years, too.  I think we're planning on going out with my brother and his friends, which should be fun.  I'm very much looking forward to seeing my Mom (and very much dreading seeing the extended family - ugh ugh ugh) but not really looking forward to the drive down there.  We do it all in one go, and it's 950 miles.  It takes us 13 hours of straight driving, but with breaks (and we don't stop often), it becomes 14 hours.  With the time change driving east, we show up in TN around 15 hours after setting off.  We're doing *damn* good (for us) if we manage to get on the road by 10am, so, you do the math.  We may not even leave Des Moines until 11; every time, we say we'll try to leave early, and every time, we don't.  We're the two biggest night-owls you'll ever meet (another reason that same ex-relationship didn't work: he tried to change me too much, including making me into a morning person) and we like it that way.  The idea of going to bed before 3am is completely distasteful to us, impossible really, and we're often up until much later than that.  

Enough rambling for now!"

"event","I've been cooking from Julia's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and, tonight, made my first truly successful crepes.  Not that crepes themselves are all that difficult, but the couple of times I've attempted it previously, the batter wasn't light enough and the crepes turned out too dense.  These were light and extremely thin and had the same taste and texture as the ones I've had in Paris.  The secret, apparently, is to chilling the batter for at least 2 hours before making the crepes - this allows the flour particles to expand in the batter and makes for a lighter crepe.  Or so says Julia.

Mmmmm, Nutella-and-banana crepes.  I feel like I'm back in Paris."

"event","My god, it's been over three weeks since my last entry.  I still need to write about the Mexico City trip and perhaps some about what I've been up to generally, but for now, Happy Thanksgiving to all of you!

I'll be spending the day with Jeff's family.  I miss my own family every Thanksgiving, but this year, I'll get to spend Xmas Eve and Day with them, so that helps make up for it.  And I'm looking forward to this extended weekend if for no other reason than both Jeff and I are completely free from any other obligations and can just relax and do things we both enjoy.

It snowed today.  It was beautiful - I always love the first snow of the year, because it's beautiful but short-lived.  It will likely be completely melted within a few days, if that.  I'm not, however, happy about the furnace problems we've been having today.  Really don't want to call a furnace guy out over a holiday weekend.  Can you say CA-CHING$$$$$$?

It's a nice, cool fall evening, so it was time for me to pull out the ol' goulash recipe.  Hungarian-style goulash, not American, the latter being some strange staple of yesteryear's housewives that bears no resemblance to the original.  American goulash typically consists of hamburger meat, onions, tomato sauce, and pasta (usually elbow macaroni), and frankly, doesn't taste very good.  Hungarian goulash is a spicier, more flavorful dish that can be either a soup-like texture which you then put over mashed potatoes or noodles, or a hearty stew-like texture, in which case you'd thicken it with diced potatoes that cook along with the meat.  I much prefer the stew version; if you don't, omit the potatoes.

Recipe:  Heat some olive oil in a large pot, dice a large yellow onion (about 2 cups of diced onion), add it to the pot and let it carmelize a bit.  Add 3 cloves of fresh garlic, finely diced, along with 3 TBSP of tomato paste, 2 TBSP balsamic vinegar, 2 tsp dried marjoram, 1/4 tsp dried thyme, 1 bay leaf, 2 cups chicken broth, and most importantly: paprika - 1.5 TBSP of sweet paprika + 1 tsp spicy paprika (you can sub sweet if you don't want it to have heat, or if you like a lot of heat, use less sweet).  Try to find a nice quality paprika - I like Penzeys.  Now, cut around 2 pounds of beef chuck or beef shank into cubes and peel & dice 1 or 1.5 baking potatoes into cubes.  Add the potato and beef cubes, season with salt and pepper, stir it all up and let it cook on medium-low-ish heat (gentle simmer) for at least an hour and a half, and maybe even 2 or more (all depends on how large your cubes are and how tough/tender the meat).  It's done when the meat is tender and the potatoes have disintegrated into the stew, thickening it. Yum.

Note: Some people prefer to brown the beef along with the onion before adding all the liquids.  I suppose it makes for ""prettier"" beef when it's been browned, but honestly, underneath all that orange-red sauce, you can't see it, nor can you taste any difference (I've tried both).

Enjoy :)"

"event","A few weeks ago, we received a catalog from Meduri World Delights that immediately made us drool.  It's a company that specializes in all sorts of dried fruits and their pictures made them look completely delicious.  Jeff and I often keep some sort of dried fruit around to snack on, our favorite being some dried tart cherries from Michigan.  So, we figured we'd give Meduri a chance.  We ordered a sampler of dried peaches, mandarin oranges, and apricots + some dried Bing cherries.  

So I got the fruit last night and was all excited to try it today, when I notice the ingredients list.  Grrrrrrrr.  Natural flavors.  High fructose corn syrup.  Grrrrrrrrrr.  I do not buy dried fruit, probably one of the healthiest things ever, to eat ""natural"" flavor and HFCS.  Especially not from a company that charges as much as they do for their ""premium"" dried fruit.  Uh huh, it tastes premium because you amplify it with flavoring!  And the fruit itself tastes a lot like jam.  Super-sticky sweet.  

Now I understand ""natural"" flavoring is extremely hard to avoid, and I'm no nutrition nazi in this regard (I gladly eat things containing natural and artificial flavors, though generally, I try to avoid anything too insanely artificial) - I mean, I ate a damn good hot dog in Boston and you really don't want to know what's in those.  The whole ""natural flavors"" thing peeves me anyhow because you really don't know what you're getting.  Some of them are better/more natural than others.  But just because they call it natural doesn't really mean that it is, in the sense that most people think of ""natural"" - it still comes from a lab, where flavorists work to combine so-called natural chemicals with other natural chemicals until they get something that tastes yummy.

As for me, I'm kind of strange.  I'm such a hedonist with food that you'd think that I'd be one of those ""if it tastes good, who cares what's really in it?"" kind of people, but I'm not.  I'm not a health-nut freak either, though ... I eat lots of ""bad"" things.  The dried fruit thing bugs, though, because you expect that crap from Hostess or Nabisco, not from a freakin' premium dried fruit company.  So I wrote them, with a mini version of this rant:

<lj-cut>

Hello,

I recently received my order, and I wanted to write to express my disappointment that your dried mandarin oranges and Harvest Pride peaches include Natural Flavor in their list of ingredients.  Natural flavors are admittedly in so many products that it makes it difficult to avoid them; however, when given a choice between a product which contains them and one that does not, I will always pick the one that does not.  I was surprised to see that you add natural flavoring to your fruit; I prefer fruit to speak on its own merit because when you taste dried fruit that has had natural flavors added, you don't know if you're tasting the fruit itself or if the fruit was middling quality that has been ""amped up"" with flavoring.

Second, your products contain high fructose corn syrup and the exteriors appear to be dusted with sugar.  In fairness, I should have asked before ordering since I care about these issues.  However, with dried fruit more than most things, it was easy for me to assume that I'd be getting fruit and nothing else.  (When I buy dried cherries from chefshop.com, for example, the back of the package reads ""Ingredients: Cherries"")  Therefore, my suggestion would be for you to, at some point, update your website so that your product pages show the ingredients list for each item.  As I'm sure that you stand behind your product, there's no reason to be ashamed of these additions just because a tiny subset of people will care - and it would prevent people like me from being disappointed when we receive our fruit.

Respectfully,
Tara L.


I'm curious to see whether they'll respond."

"event","The weather's turning cooler here, and it's nice.  I love this time of year.  I much prefer fall and spring to the extremes of winter and summer, and maybe love fall most of all since it doesn't (usually) rain endlessly like it does in the spring.  On the other hand, the days get longer in spring, which makes me happy, whereas I'm not liking the increasingly shorter days we're having now.

Anyway, a chill is in the air.  I've been crazily running from place to place for a couple of days, and everywhere I go, I see women wearing knee-high boots.  I love knee-high boots, especially if the heel is a stiletto instead of the chunky type.  The ogling won't be great for another few weeks - it's not cold enough yet - but it's another reason why I love fall.

See, in Iowa, we have 4 very definite seasons.  From about December until March-April, we wear layers.  Thick sweaters, wool pants, Smartwool socks, coats, hats, gloves.  And we stay inside an awful lot, hiding from the take-your-breath-away icy wind.  While I hate the winter, it does have its pleasures.  There's the gorgeous snowy days, before all the white snow becomes nasty and gray and dehydrated.  And when spring finally comes, it seems like Spring Fever actually exists here.  Back in the South, we never really had such a change from winter to spring and so didn't feel that rush of happiness and energy it seems like most people here get as soon as the temperature tops 55.  People start running around in shorts and t-shirts at the earliest possible opportunity, when at the same temperature in fall they wouldn't dream of being so scantily clad.  In spring, after a season of covering up as much as possible, it feels positively sensual, though terribly revealing, to bare even your arms.  Bare feet become sexy.  The guys on Iowa State's campus are terribly distracted by the parade of bare skin constantly walking by.  Spring and summer are, to them and to most people, the time when women look their most appealing.

Bah, I say!  For me, it's fall.  To me, it's actually kind of a turn-off to see a girl in a short skirt and tank top.  It's utilitarian when the heat reaches into the 90s, sure, but not sexy.  Give me knee-high boots that show the outline of the leg underneath.  Maybe paired with a pencil skirt hugging the hourglass of waistline and hips, leaving just a 3 or 4 inch gap of bare leg between boots and skirt.  My thoughts, all my attention, will center then on just those lovely few inches.  And don't get me started on tight-fitting turtleneck sweaters or the rosy flush of a woman's cheeks just in from the cold.

*sigh*  I'm a married woman who loves looking (if only looking) at other women.  And the looking... is best in the fall."

"event","So Jeff finally took the Munster from hell to work today.  His boss Ed (well, sort of boss) is a bit of a foodie, so Jeff brought him some of our kickass Mexican vanilla in a little jar and then brought out the Munster (in a Tupperware container) to show him, thinking it would gross him out just as much as it did us.

Now, Ed is taking the cheese home this weekend to try/share with his family.  He sniffed it several times and thinks he and his wife will like it!  

Jeff was stunned, and IMed me to tell me that his fumigate-Ed's-office plan failed.  He laughingly called Ed a ""dirty nasty man"" which cracked me up.  From IM:

Tara says:
Whaaaaaa?  He liked it?!?!  Crazy man...
Jeff says:
Yeah - he's a dirty nasty man!
Tara says:
Next thing we'll hear is that his goat-cheese loving daughter ate it up by the spoonful and our foodiness will be put to shame by a 7 year old.
Jeff says:
No kidding! I can't believe he liked it.
Tara says:
And I thought *I* was kind of kinky.  Methinks Ed is secretly a kinky kinky little man.
Jeff says:
ROFL I really don't want to think about the dirty nasty things Ed and his dirty nasty wife do.

Whereas we were both able to eat Epoisses, we took one bite of this and both ran for the trash to spit it out.  Blech.  Luckily, it was only a $2 piece.  Jeff is taking the rest of it to ""show and tell"" tomorrow at work (LOL).  He has a collegue that is apparently a bit of a foodie and enjoys cheeses, so we'll see if this guy can handle the Munster.

"event","I recently took a pregnancy test for the second time ever in my life.  I was 3 days overdue on my cycle, and I'm never overdue, so it was concerning.  Plus, in Salem, right around the time when I should have been ovulating, Jeff and I had a bit of a ... mishap.  Without getting into any squicky details, it was a minor mishap rather than a major one, but still.  Of course, only a few hours after taking the pregnancy test (and seeing a negative result), I got my period.  

Waiting to see whether a pink line would appear or not felt so strange; time slowed down and those minutes felt so long.  I had turned the stick over so I wouldn't be able to see the result until I flipped it over.  I had to take a few deep breaths before flipping it, knowing I'd either be really relieved or really freaked out at what I'd see.  Waiting for (medical) test results is always weird anyhow.  When I had my blood drawn a few months ago to find out my cholesterol, I told them to test me for everything else too since they could run several tests on the same amount of blood... namely Hepatitis A, B, C, and HIV.  During the two week waiting period, I was halfway convinced that my cholesterol numbers would come back high, thanks to the fact that I use only real butter in all my cooking and I don't shy away from cream, or duck confit, etc.  (The #s ended up great)  I was also a bit weirded out about waiting for the Hep and HIV results too, since I'd never been tested for them before.  And while I wasn't concerned about having gotten Hep or HIV from my sexual experience, I got a tattoo 8 years ago.  Tattoos are extrememly safe these days, but hey, you just never know.  Of course, all of those tests came back negative too.  Still, the waiting is weird.

Weirder still is the difference between how I felt taking this pregnancy test versus the last one (years ago).  Last time, I was worried sick and I honestly didn't know what I would do if it were positive.  This time, I was less disturbed.  I'm generally getting used to the idea of having a child and, while I'm not ready yet, I would have made the best of it, probably been scared and nervous but then ultimately happy.  I'd much rather Jeff and I make a conscious, deliberate decision to start trying as opposed to having it be an accident, but I'd have been okay.

If I'm truly honest with myself, 95% of me was completely relieved. 5% of me was slightly disappointed.  

Who am I?!?  For the longest time, I didn't think I'd ever want kids, period.  When Jeff and I got married, I definitely didn't want to get started right away.  We were too young and I would have hated for people to think we'd gotten married so quickly for some reason other than that we were (crazily) in love.  In the years after that, again, we were too young.  In all honesty, we knew each other pretty well before getting married, but we only *really* got to know each other after being married.  And then there have been the rocky times, times when we've been thisclose to bailing out.  Luckily those times have been few, and we got past them and they've made us stronger.  Divorce is horrible no matter the circumstances, but kids change everything, and I'd never want to bring one into the world unless Jeff and I were on rock-solid ground.  Now I feel (for the first time) like there's been a real, lasting change in our relationship and that the things we've struggled with before are truly part of our past.  Not that we won't have issues in the future (anyone who tells you marriage is always easy probably hasn't been married, or at least, hasn't been married for 5+ years), but nothing as truly divisive as before.

So anyway.  I'm not ready yet.  Not yet.  But I actually Tivo'd (and watched) a kid's movie a couple months ago - Nanny McPhee - and enjoyed it.  I don't (usually) do kids movies.  I've since watched others, along with a few animated movies thrown in too.  A couple days ago, I just finished reading the first Harry Potter book, liked it, and plan to read the others.  I'd never normally touch a book like that.  I (usually) hate fantasy-type books and movies.  Even as a kid I liked my books realistic - no Narnia or LoTR for me.  And when I'm out in public, I notice babies and young kids more and they're much cuter to me now.  I've had a few girlfriends over the years that would coo at babies we passed while shopping and exclaim how cute, blah-blah-blah, and I internally rolled my eyes and didn't get it at all.  Now I'm that girl.  WTF?  I don't know what's caused this relatively fast change in me, I'm not acting like myself at all - I always thought the whole biological clock thing wouldn't happen to me, or if it did, I'd be at least 35 before I started hearing it.  But here I am, 26, and the ticking is oh-so-faint, but it's there.  Oh is it there."

"event","I'm going to Mexico City, Nov 3-8.  Plane tix booked, hotel room reserved.  Gulp.  

I'll arrive in Mexico City early enough on the 3rd (around noon) for us to hopefully be able to make the most of that day.  The hotel looks good.  It's not exactly luxurious, but is highly recommended with a perfect location, and costs only $47 USD/night and that *includes* breakfast and tax.

I do have a few concerns about Mexico City.  Some people warn of how dangerous it is, but generally speaking, it's gotten so much safer in recent years and as long as we stick to the touristy areas and don't get too far off the beaten track, we should be fine.  We'll only use radio taxis or taxis the hotel calls for us, and we won't be staying out late at night.  We'll drink only bottled water, and I might see the doctor about getting some antibiotics to take with me on the off chance I get sick on the trip and need them (though, for the most part, the threat of ""Montezuma's Revenge"" is greatly overstated if you take some precautions).  I have just under 4 weeks to learn some very basic Spanish, of which I know NONE right now.  But I can do it.  I'm not taking our expensive DSLR camera, and I'm leaving jewelry behind and dressing casually.  My blonde hair though, from what I understand, will still bring a lot of attention, but I won't be alone.

I'm actually really looking forward to it.  It will feel more foreign that anywhere else I've been, a total change of pace from Europe, and it will also make a nice scouting trip.  If I really enjoy it, then perhaps Jeff and I can add Mexico to our list of places to visit, and it would be a cheap vacation for us later.  

And finally, I have to give major props to Jeff.  I have, bar none, the coolest, most amazing husband ever.  That he's giving me this trip, on my own, speaks to his love and confidence in me.  Jeff kicks ass."

"event","Jeff and I often joke about my ""food ambitions"" - things I'm really curious to try, even if I don't like whatever it is, just to say I tried it.

I've knocked quite a few things off the list lately.  For example, I recently had the extreme pleasure of trying a raw milk taleggio (cheese).  It's illegal here, as are all raw-milk (unpasteurized) cheeses unless aged for 90+ days.  But if you sweet-talk your local cheese shop, you can sometimes score a contraband treasure, and this was that.  Deee-licious and stinky in a good way.  

The lobster I mentioned in my Salem entry was another one.  I very much enjoyed it, though I'm not sure Jeff enjoyed watching me dig out the meat from its tail and claws.  He was sweet enough to remind me that the poor lobster had been alive until just a few minutes prior, when it was killed for my benefit, which made me feel a bit like a cheetah on one of those National Geographic shows that show the cheetah, its face all bloody, ripping into the hollowed-out carcass of its newly-dead prey.  That took my enthusiasm down only a fraction of a percent.

We also tried another infamous cheese recently, a French cheese so stinky that it's been banned from French public transport:  Epoisses.  And yes, it is *that* stinky.  Not just gym-sock stinky.  More like if you took the sweaty-ass socks off of Napoleon's soldiers after they'd been marching hundreds of miles for weeks on end.  In August.  And then stuffed said socks into your mouth.  A veritable explosion of sweat and ass and barnyard and mushrooms.  Mmmmmm, right?  Well, honestly, I didn't so much enjoy it (though, surprisingly, Jeff actually kinda liked it!  Dirty, dirty boy!), but I can say that I've tried it.  It had long been on my ""ambitions"" list.

Let's see, what else?  Non-homogenized milk rocks my face off.  I hate milk but love this stuff.  It tastes the way milk should taste, the way I imagine it used to taste.  It has the cream on top and you have to shake it really well to get the cream to integrate into the milk before pouring it if you don't want a kinda chunky product, but oh man, is it ever good.  Just a few tablespoons of it in my English Breakfast tea elevate it to a whole new level, not to mention what it does for simple cereal, or *drool* Scharffen Berger hot cocoa.  You seriously don't know what you're missing if you haven't tried their cocoa.  It isn't dutched, and beats every other cocoa I've tried:  3 tablespoons cocoa powder + maybe 2 tablespoons sugar + milk = KA-POW!  My first cup of that was enough to lay me out on the couch for a blissful 15-minute come-down.

I tried dates for the first time recently.  And pepino melon.  And meyer lemons (all you Californians can suck it; they're hard to get around here!).  And finally, organic hardneck garlic (chefshop.com) that is so far beyond the softneck grocery store stuff it's incredible.  I've eaten it raw.  Yum to all.

But perhaps the most revelatory of experiences thus far was true, traditional balsamic vinegar.  Not that crap you get at the grocery store, oh no.  Not even the good stuff you find for $40/bottle.  Oh no.  The *good* stuff, the transcendent stuff, the stuff that costs $100 - $180 per 3oz bottle.  The stuff that you measure out by pipette, and it only takes about 10 drops to coat your entire palette and bring you to food-gasm with a lingering 30-second aftertaste.  You'd never, ever put it on a salad.  Maybe a few drops on a steak, but mostly, you enjoy it on its own.  We tasted a 50 year old silver label from Cavalli and a gold label from Leonardi.  The latter is from Modena and was more acidic than the smoother Cavalli one from Emilia-Romagna, and as a result, I actually preferred the silver label to the gold.  Here's a lot of info on the real stuff, the black gold:  http://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/oils/about-balsamic-vinegar.asp

Okay, so what's next on my list?  I want to try raw oysters.  I've never had one.  Crazy.  I want to find a few good recipes for rabbit because I've seen our local Gateway Market selling it, and I love rabbit.  And somewhere along the way, I need to keep furthering my appreciation for white wines, because basically, I only really love reds, though I do love champagne.

Things I just cannot get into, even though I've tried them multiple times:  Goat cheese - any kind of goat cheese.  I just hate that ""goatiness"" that they all have, even the mild ones.  Blech.  Liver pate.  Cheese that smell of ammonia, even faintly - real Brie, Coulommiers...  Bloody-raw meat.  Mango.  Walnuts.  Venison."

We're going for a wedding; one of Jeff's oldest and dearest friends is (finally) getting married.  We didn't think Travis would ever, ever get married.  Not that he's ever had a hard time with women, oh no, there's been tons of them... he's just (or used to be) super-super-super-picky.  Pickiness is good, I say, but he might have pushed it a little in that regard.  Jeff has met his fiancee a couple of times now, but I never have, so it will be interesting for me to see the woman he decided was worthy of marrying.

We're staying at a nice bed and breakfast.  Tomorrow, we'll just relax there.  Friday we're exploring Salem and then going on a dinner cruise with all the wedding attendees.  Saturday is the wedding.  It also happens to be Jeff and I's 7 year anniversary.  Seven. Years.  In fact, 7 years ago tonight we were staying in Salt Lake City, on our cross-country drive towards Reno to get married and onwards to Seattle, to live.  This will of course make it easy to remember Travis and Marcy's anniversary in the coming years!  It's also made me a little introspective about the last 7 years, and the past year or so in particular, but I'll save that for another entry.  Anyhow, Sunday we're using our rental car to explore all day.  We haven't decided yet if we want to head into some really scenic parts of New Hampshire to see the Fall color, which won't yet be peaking but should still be nice, or if we want to drive along the Southern coast of Maine and see the pretty seaside towns.  We may yet find a way to combine fall color + coastline scenery.  We'll have our laptop and GPS with us, so I'm not too concerned that we haven't finalized any plans yet.  We fly back Monday evening.  We may, or may not, have some time to see some of Boston too before flying out.  Playing it all by ear.  

Apparently we're going to Salem during its high season, which comes to a frenzied peak at Halloween.  Go figure.  Hundreds (thousands?) of witches (Wiccans) descend on Salem right around this time.  Should be interesting.  Salem is also apparently filled with all kinds of touristy-kitschy wiccan shops and palm reading places.  Which isn't my thing, but reminds me of the weird phase I went through in high school which embarasses me to no end now.  I wore black from head-to-toe on a semi-regular basis.  (What can I say - I still love black.)  I even had a pentagram necklace that my then-boyfriend picked up for me when he went to a bigger town.  I was never actually Wiccan, mind you; I just thought it was fun as hell to freak out the close-minded Bible-thumpers in my small South Carolina hometown.  I enjoyed toying with them and I didn't care what other people thought about me.  Looking back on it, I shudder with how very typically teenage-angsty I was at that time.  I wrote bad poetry, yearned for guys I couldn't have, hated my parents, and couldn't wait to leave that town.  *sigh*

So, anyway!  Hopefully this will be a fun trip, and hopefully, it will take my mind off the bothersome things that have been weighing on me recently.  Yay for travel!"

"event","I've mentioned before that I get ""food highs"" - after eating something particularly delicious, my brain sort of floods with dopamine and I get all floaty/happy.  Not just happy like I imagine most people do, but scary-happy.  I honestly liken it to the feeling you have when you get off a roller-coaster ride, or right after, well .... um, yeah.  I'm in the middle of a *great* food high right now, thanks to the fantastic sushi from Waterfront in WDM.  I tried sushi for the very first time maybe 3 years ago, and while I liked it, I didn't looove it.  I was always confused when people spoke about getting ""addicted"" to it, really craving it.  And now I'm one of them.  (This is unusual for me, as I don't even care for fish 99% of the time, though I do love shellfish.)  I think I never really fell for sushi before because I'd only had it from one restaurant, Taki, where the flavor of the nori (seaweed wrap) is stronger than it is at Waterfront.

I had a scary-strong sushi craving all day, and it finally got satisfied a half hour ago.  And daaaaamn I feel good.

But I'll bet I'll be feeling even better (if it's possible) on Friday, because on Friday, my huge-ass can of duck confit will be here.  I'm thinking duck confit + potatoes cooked in duck fat + salad with pears, gorgonzola, and balsamic + a nice Cotes du Rhone.  Mmmmmmmmm.  If there's anything that epitomizes the ""French paradox"" (the way French people generally don't get fat despite eating so-called ""bad"" things) more than duck confit, I'm not sure what it would be.  Foie gras maybe?  Triple cream cheese?  Seriously though, duck confit is the be-all end-all, the proof that a higher power exists, my last-meal-on-death-row kind of thing for me.  And a huge freaking amount of it will be here on Friday.  I may not survive that kind of a high, but I look forward to trying!"

"event","I'm an aunt!  Monica gave birth to Luke Avery Lanning this morning around 7am; he weighed 8 pounds & 6 ounces, is 21 inches long, and has a full head of dark brown hair.  I haven't heard the whole story yet, but I guess the birth was fairly difficult, albeit semi-quick since it was ""only"" 12 hours from her first contractions to the birth - first births can take much longer.  The epidural wore off towards the end of her labor (ouch!) and they had to use the vacuum thingy to help him along. There were also some minor worries because he was 9 days overdue, so they are keeping him in the neonatal ICU for observation until this evening, just to make sure everything's okay.  From the two pics I saw of him, he's quite cute.

"event","So, Jeff lived!  He went through with skydiving.  We met up with three of his co-workers at his workplace and then drove out to the Winterset airport.  After just a couple minutes of instructions, he got suited up in his harness and boarded the tiny little plane.  I was glad that only two tandem pairs could fit into the plane at once, because it left two of his co-workers on the ground to chat with and distract me from the possibility that Jeff could possibly become a bunch of goo on the ground shortly.  I'm making light of it, but I really did have knots in my stomach when he gave me a little kiss and walked away to the plane.  

Around 20 minutes later, the plane was but a speck in the sky, but we heard the motor slow dramatically and struggled to make out the jumpers.  We thought we saw something, but it was difficult to know for certain where they were until the parachutes opened, which thankfully, they did without needing to pull any reserve chutes (an event which happens fairly frequently, in about 1 of 400 jumps).  I couldn't tell which one was Jeff until he got closer to the ground.  I managed to take some pictures of him in the air and during landing.  The landing was soft.  

Afterwards, Jeff was pretty excited, and kind of unbelieving that he'd just jumped out of a plane at 10,000 feet.  He said the worst part was that the plane didn't have a door, and they were just sitting there in the floor, next to the door, watching the ground get farther and farther away as the plane rose to altitude.  And there's that bizarre moment when he looked out the open door and thought he couldn't possibly be planning on jumping out of it within a few minutes.  But he did, and had around 30 seconds of free-falling at 120mph, then a nice 5-6 minute glide down under the canopy.  All in all, he enjoyed it, and said he'd probably do it again, but wouldn't necessarily seek it out.  For some people, it's apparently the biggest adrenaline high of their life; they become almost addicted to it, and that first jump is somehow life-changing for them.  Not so with Jeff, thank god.  It's just something cool he can put on his ""I did that"" list.

Saturday was a gorgeous day for jumping, with a clear blue sky and virtually no wind.  Today, it is cool, gray, and rainy.  Fall has most definitely arrived - you can totally tell that chilly air is just around the corner now.  Ah well.  I love fall; it's probably my favorite season - early fall at least.  I don't like late fall, when you suddenly realize that fall is quickly turning to winter and that you have 5 more months of nastiness ahead.  Yuck.  Someday I want to live in a place where cooler weather doesn't account for fully half of the year."

"event","So a couple of weeks ago Jeff informs me that he wants to go skydiving with some co-workers.  Mmmkay.  Apparently one guy who works with Jeff is a skydiving freak who's finally reached the point where he can do solo jumps, and he started talking about it in the office, and a bunch of other guys decided they should all go skydiving last weekend.  Jeff wanted to go, but plans fell apart when many of his co-workers were occupied last weekend.  Whew.  Jeff didn't sound *that* gung-ho about it, so I figured I was safe now... no skydiving.

Nope.  Now they're apparently going tomorrow, as long as the weather stays okay.  If the wind is over 20mph, they can't go.  Jeff and I of course discussed it, and I *did/do* have veto-power.  I really, really don't want him to go, but I'm not going to be a stick-in-the-mud wife and stand in his way.  So if he wants to go, he can go.  Why anyone in their right mind would want to jump out of an airplane at 10,000 or so feet is beyond my comprehension, and I'd like to take this moment to point out that there IS a reason why insurance companies have higher rates for MALES.  But whatever.  So tomorrow, Jeff skydives.  *sigh*  I'm going to try not to dwell on it too much, because I know that, statistically, it's incredibly safe.  Well, flying is incredibly safe too, much safer than driving a car, and turbulence still freaks me out.  Phobias aren't rational.

There is one small upside - with him going skydiving, he's told me I don't have to get him anything for his birthday (Sept. 21) since skydiving is a little expensive.  I'll probably still get him a couple things, but perhaps this gets me off the hook for some of the bizarre present ideas he's been coming up with.... If you or anyone you know is a geek, check out http://www.unitednuclear.com  There is WAY TOO MUCH stuff on that site that you can get into trouble with!

For instance, Jeff is the sort of geek that would just loooove a Geiger counter.  And, of course, some uranium ore to go along with it.  Yep, they sell that stuff.  For the record, I might get him some low or medium radiation ore, but I wouldn't even think of getting him the super high (40,000-60,000 CPM) or ultra high (61,000-80,000 CPM) level stuff, even though I think on some strange level, he'd probably love to have something like that, in its own protective lead canister, of course (which they also sell).  

He also wants some magnets.  They sell magnets that are *much* more powerful than average magnets you run into, and I'd get him some of those.  However, I don't think I could deal with getting him a Supermagnet.  Just read this warning:  

""If you really need unbelievably powerful magnets, here they are.  Uses include magnetic steering of nuclear particles in accelerators, levitation devices, magnetic beam amplifiers, scrap iron separators, etc.  Beware - you must think ahead when moving these magnets.  If carrying one into another room, carefully plan the route you will be taking. Computers & monitors will be affected in an entire room. Loose metallic objects and other magnets may become airborne and fly considerable distances - and at great speed - to attach themselves to this magnet. If you get caught in between the two, you can get injured.  Two of these magnets close together can create an almost unbelievable magnetic field that can be very dangerous. Of all the unique items we offer for sale, we consider these items the most dangerous of all. Our normal packing & shipping personnel refuse to package these magnets - our engineers have to do it. This is no joke and we cannot stress it strongly enough - that you must be extremely careful - and know what you're doing with these magnets.  Take Note: Two Super magnets can very easily get out of control and break fingers and even your arm if opposing poles fly at each other.  If working with multiple Supermagnets, always handle one magnet at a time, secure it, then proceed to the next magnet.""

Jeff read that, and of course, his eyes lit up and he grinned mischievously.  I really don't think he'd actually want one; he just likes to think about what it would be like to have one.

Tomorrow, my man is going skydiving."

"event","Iowa has become the second state, after Massachusetts, to allow gay marriage.  Not ""same-sex domestic partnership"" but marriage.  I'm stunned.  I never would have guessed Iowa, of all places, would ever be on the bleeding edge of civil rights issues.  Gay couples can apply for a marriage license today (Friday) and be married by Wednesday.

I'm full of admiration for this judge.  Whether you're in favor of gay marriage or not, what he did was brave.  He'll be lauded by many, true; but it's also extremely likely that he will have to deal with harassing phone calls and such too.  I just hope he doesn't get death threats.  As for me, I'm (gulp) proud to be an Iowan today!  The case will surely be appealed, and nothing will be final until the Iowa Supreme Court eventually has its say, but this is a very good start.

Hurray for equal rights and due process of law!

"event","The whole house smells scruptious - we just got done making oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.  Yum!  I've made several batches in the last few weeks, pawning most of them off on Jeff's grateful co-workers, and came up with the receipe that seems to work best:

1 1/2 cups FLOUR or omit salt and baking powder below if you use SELF-RISING FLOUR
1/2 teaspoon SALT
1/2 teaspoon BAKING POWDER  
8 ounces (2 sticks) BUTTER, softened
1 tsp VANILLA
1 cup BROWN SUGAR, packed
1 cup GRANULATED SUGAR
2 large EGGS
3 cups OATS
1 BAG NESTLE TOLLHOUSE CHOCOLATE CHIPS

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees, and line cookie sheets with parchment paper.

2. Whisk flour, salt and baking powder together in a medium bowl.

3. In a separate bowl, by hand or by mixer, beat butter until creamy. Add sugars and beat the mixture until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in vanilla and the eggs one at a time.

4. Stir dry ingredients into butter-sugar mixture with a wooden spoon or a large rubber spatula. Stir in oats and chocolate chips.

5. Place dough onto parchment-lined cookie sheets by large spoonfuls (about 2 tablespoons each), leaving at least 2 inches between.

6. Bake until cookie edges turn golden brown, 13-15 minutes. Slide cookies (on parchment) onto cooling rack. Let cool, and store in airtight container.

**On a related note, the best vanilla I've EVER found, better than Nielsen-Massey and other ""premium"" vanillas, is La Vencedora Mexican Vanilla.  I recently bought a 32oz bottle (Yes, I said 32oz!) for $14ish including shipping, from ebay.  It's amazing stuff, not so alcoholic as most vanilla extracts, with a really beautiful aroma.  I highly recommend it - get it if you or anyone you know is a baker!**"

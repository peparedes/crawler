"event","I have a lot of emotions right now that I just need to express. I was just told today that my Grandma's condition was as bad as we all thought. The cancer finally caught up to her just as we thought she'd beat the record of living past 64. It just hurts so bad because my grandma is one of the only positive influences from my mom's side of the family. It hurts that I feel that the only one who will take any values that she has will be me. It tears me up inside to know that one day I will not be able to hear her sweet singing voice anymore. I miss her late night lullabys. I really wanted her to see me break our family cycle and graduate college. I really want to tell her how much she means to me. How much I love her. How much I appreciate the fact that she always encouraged me when I felt dumb. Grandma really was the foundation of this family because she had enough love to keep us together. She trully is an angel on earth and I will miss her when she's gone. Her values live on in me and I will be very sure to pass them on to my children. It gives me even more dedication to succeed in college because I know she will live on in my heart. I can't hold on forever because I know that God just needed his angel back a little early. I love you grandma........."

"event","Well, this week has definitely been interesting and hectic, just as all my first weeks of school always are. Last semester I had the birth of Rayden and a surgery right after. This week Rayden has been having seizures and it has gotten me all worked up. I am just ready to know what is wrong with him so we know what we're dealing with and can hopefully treat it. Then I can focus on the other things in life like work and school since Physics has me worried now. 
     I guess there is some good news for me now. Tomorrow I finally get the replica belt I have waited a long time to get and the day after I get the video game I have waited months for. Not to mention Monday Night RAW comes on tomorrow night as well.
     And the best news of all remains that my wife is still by my side. When she's around, I sometimes feel that I can do anything. She's beautiful and I know I say this a lot, but I can think of no one better to take care of my children than her. She's very dedicated and she never ceases to amaze me in all areas of our lives. Thanks sweetie!
     Anyways, enough of the mushy stuff. It's time for me to get back to looking at all of my nerd stuff. Until next time....."

"event","There isn't much for me to talk about, just my nerd stuff mostly. So last night one of my favorite wrestlers won the championship. RANDY ORTON! Okay, enough of that, I just wanted to let my wife know that it's okay to be grumpy sometimes because we all are. I am very proud to have my wonderful wife in my life and I could think of no one better to help with the kids than Elyse! Thanks for being there for me!"

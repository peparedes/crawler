"event","so. i have finally graduated from uni. it was definitely not an easy path&nbsp;that i have chosen ever since i decided to leave JC in 2007. these 5 years of agony was unforgettable and it will never be forgotten. there were happiness, laughter and tears along the way but i am glad that i have made it through. worth it or not, you decide.

now. i am officially a working adult. there is a different kind of stress, worries and compeition along the way. i must say, i have not yet gotten used to it. it is hard, but i will pull through by hook or by crook.

through these years, i think the biggest achievement i have gotten was friday. out of so many years, i have finally realised and found a friend, a true friend. the 2 years when we were best friends, the 6 years without contacting each other due to misunderstandings, and the 2 years that we buried the hatchet, and finally we managed to find out what really&nbsp;went&nbsp;wrong so many years ago. it took us exactly&nbsp;10 years to find out who we really are. it was not easy talking things out but hey, we did it and this made our friendship special (: friends come and go, but i believe that she will be there for me this entire lifetime. thank you (:"

work is taxing, sucking&nbsp;every ounce of my energy away. never felt so tired in my life before. the people are nice to me maybe cos i am the youngest there, but of cos there are limitations. its hard to elaborate, but just hoping for the best now.

2 months into my last sem, and i have not settle down. its just hard for me to get into full concentration this sem. tests, projects, lessons, my committment in it decrease as each day passes. my last sem, and i really want to pass it and get it done with. almost 2 years of studying part time, i am finally going to end it in a month. just got pull through no matter what. 

cant wait for june to come.&nbsp;thats when&nbsp;all the agony&nbsp;are over.&nbsp;perseverence&nbsp;is a key factor now.&nbsp;i just need a&nbsp;little&nbsp;motivation&nbsp;for this 2 months&nbsp;to pass by..&nbsp;"

managed to take a good break this sem and finally got to go back home after 4 years. i must say, everything has changed, changed for the better or worst depends on different views. but i must say it was a trip that i spent meaningfully and it was&nbsp;unforgettable. the&nbsp;trip back&nbsp;has changed many&nbsp;of my&nbsp;thinkings&nbsp;and&nbsp;now i am&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;things&nbsp;in a new perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;i always didnt like to go back home in my younger days but i never knew that i missed the place so much once i was back there. the departure was an emotional one. cos after this time, i wont know when will be the next time i will be seeing my grandparents. they are of an old age. it was indeed heartbreaking.

now that i am back in spore. new challenges are ahead waiting for me. looking for job, last sem in uni, getting certs. i just want to use up every ounce of my energy to do everything that i can. realised that time passes too fast to regret anything. so the only way is to spend these moments fulfillingly before i hit the big 3. got to plan my time properly from now on and i need to do sth abt my addiction to the computer."

got to know some unknown truth that was due 6 years ago. it was hard to accept it and i am really shocked to hear that. never knew people were looking and observing my every move and action during that time. just because i was in one of the better class and a top cca doesnt mean that i am high profile, instead tried to make myself as unknown as possible. but i guess, i was at the wrong place at the wrong time. it was still hard for me to accept this fact. argh damnit"

"event","woots. nearly a year without posting anything. so much things had happened. life is not easy at all but i think i had somehow understand the way this society works.

stepping into the working world is no joke and indeed it was a big step for me. but i think and realised it is sooooo different from sch. cant talk much, cant show much, cant do much. the only thing i can do is to&nbsp;keep quiet and observe. it was a valuable&nbsp;learning experience for me and i think i will do better for my next job!&nbsp;

cant believe i have alr worked for one year! one full year of work and of cos studies. cant say it&nbsp;was an easy&nbsp;or taxing year&nbsp;but i think there are sacrifices to be made. one more year and i will be graduating, time flies but i really wanted to make use of this time to enjoy myself to the fullest. wont know how long more i will be staying here but it had&nbsp;played a big part in my life and i will always rmb it. there is a new world for me to challenge it so i shall keep myself fresh

i have learned not to look at things too seriously and i think i am still learning and putting things down well. cos i know some stuff is fated to be like this. but trust still matter to me the most."

"event","had been a long time since i have updated this place.

these 6 months&nbsp;passed&nbsp;like a breeze.
jan, i was&nbsp;still&nbsp;a student then&nbsp;taking&nbsp;my final sem in NYP,&nbsp;being stressed&nbsp;over&nbsp;sch work,&nbsp;icas and&nbsp;projects.&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;it comes&nbsp;the final&nbsp;exam&nbsp;which i must say&nbsp;the worst&nbsp;of all the rest.&nbsp;then&nbsp;i have finally officially graduated&nbsp;from&nbsp;NYP&nbsp;after 3 years&nbsp;of studies.&nbsp;i must say&nbsp;i have&nbsp;met an awesome bunch of people.&nbsp;

march, KL trip was&nbsp;next,&nbsp;spending 4days 3&nbsp;night at sunway lagoon&nbsp;before&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;goes&nbsp;their separate ways.&nbsp;cant believed that i have&nbsp;worked&nbsp;for&nbsp;2 months at IRAS too.&nbsp;getting to know the regulations&nbsp;of&nbsp;taxes.&nbsp;

may, spending a month&nbsp;doing things&nbsp;that&nbsp;i wanted to&nbsp;do.

june, finally&nbsp;another graduation trip to&nbsp;Taiwan&nbsp;with&nbsp;just&nbsp;4 people.&nbsp;

it is hard to elborate everything in details because too much as happened. and now&nbsp;its&nbsp;july,&nbsp;&nbsp;i am starting my uni studies and as well as diligently looking for a perm job. 

indeed its a new beginning, a new thinking, new environment and a new life. i shall live it to the fullest before i regret it.. 

dont think people wil be reading it anymore, it wil be my only place to vent my emotions. it is almost at the second half of the year and many things had changed. changed for the worst for me... not only did i lose my friends but also someone that i have trusted the most in my poly years. i just feel that i was being used instead of being a frd. being used as a listening ear when you drift apart from your frd, being used as person whom you can go out with, whom you can talk to when you are bored, whom you want me to do anything to your own interest. and yes, when you found better frds, patch back again with your frd, of cos, i was abandoned. and under their influence, their words, their actions, i was being treated as rubbish, as a piece of dirt. i have finally seem the reality. i cant blame anyone but myself. let me just treat it as a painful lesson. 

within this 6 months,&nbsp;many things are left unsaid, left unexplained. from being so close to being almost strangers. i really dont know what to say or do. i admit that i am not a proactive person so i think i shld just leave this behind and look foward to a new beginning. 

so from now on, a new beginning starts from here..."

(:<br />&nbsp;<br />this whole sem or rather i should say the&nbsp;entire year.. was a life changing one. many things have came and gone by and i have finally seen through&nbsp;many people and&nbsp;leant one thing. that is to live for yourself and not for others. it will only hurt you more if it doesnt reach your expectations. seriously. i got to be more selfish from now on. sadly to say. i lost the trust&nbsp;in someone. i am disappointed. rather depressing too. cos to me, nothing is more important than that. but what can i do. i need time to get over it, i will be fine one day, but not for now...<br /><br />recently, i have finally pluck up my courage to contact a friend whom i have lost contact with for almost 6 years. we were the best of friends in sec1 and 2. but due to some situations, it caused us to talk lesser and lesser with each other. maybe cos we are now all grown ups. have thought through things properly, and realised that &quot;hey, things are not as bad as what we think last time!&quot; it was a surprising reply from this frd, and it made both of our days. we have agreed to take things easily cos its really kind of wasted for the last 6 years. just imagine&nbsp;that we have known each other&nbsp;for 8 years&nbsp;now and&nbsp;out of which, 6 years are&nbsp;missing.&nbsp;omg.&nbsp;&nbsp;i cant be more happy to catch up more now. <br /><br />looking back, i am just about one and half years away from stepping into the corporate world, stepping into the next stage of my life. many do say i have the luxury of many things, but many do not know that i have the burden of the family on my shoulder. i just feel bad for using anymore of my parents money. i dont know why but i really hope i can start earning now and repay them. <br /><br />there is just too much things to consider. oh wells. but thats life. accept it.</p><br />"

"event","<p>so. 9 weeks of memorable yet torturous IPP has ended. it was&nbsp;a great&nbsp;experience&nbsp;and i have certainly&nbsp;gained&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;much&nbsp;during this&nbsp;period, be it&nbsp;knowing more about the&nbsp;financial&nbsp;institute&nbsp;to the&nbsp;knowing of people.&nbsp;i must say, working life is cruel. i hated the 2 faced person in my team. but what else can i do, i dont even have the choice to defy any orders. <br /><br />and now last sem has started, with ipp report handed it. so i can finally put my heart down until the release of results. anw, it is kind of sad that i am going to graduate sooner than i know. but before that, we will be bombarded with many many project deadlines. it is time to think about my future. how i want to move on from here and where i want to go. hard decision huh. man. i hate all these. <br /><br />there are different stages in life in which people will reach in time to come, just whether earlier or later. there is a stage whereby everything and anything came crushing down on you. when you felt that everything, sch, friends, family&nbsp; and even non living things are out there to against you.&nbsp;you lead your life&nbsp;pessimistically and with no purpose. you think this is life and accepted it. <br /><br />but after you have reached another phase in life when you get settled down. you think back&nbsp;and said &quot;hey,&nbsp;i shld&nbsp;have&nbsp;done&nbsp;it&nbsp;another way&quot; maybe&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;the time where&nbsp;you&nbsp;have&nbsp;understood&nbsp;your life&nbsp;and get to know yourself&nbsp;a little better.&nbsp;this is where you found your true friends among all these butterflies. and this is where everyone's life shld be at, with the support from friends and family. <br /><br />maybe&nbsp;i am&nbsp;still&nbsp;at the&nbsp;first stage&nbsp;huh. still takes&nbsp;time to&nbsp;forget&nbsp;my past.&nbsp;trying&nbsp;hard&nbsp;to&nbsp;get&nbsp;to know myself a little better.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

"event","so. One week just flew past like that. It was kind of fulfilling and yet depressing huh. Many outings over the first week and it was fun! Especially the movie marathons with bud, chalet with the class, and dinner with team sousday! The days were well spent. 

But sure enough, happy times are short lived, its time to settle down to get myself preparing for the majors in two weeks time. Oh man. I dont like it man :( 

Anw. I think i really shld start planning and managing my time well and not let history repeat itself. That was really hell man. So, i shld really get started now! I do hope i can keep to my promise this time eh! 

Before i stop, i would want to share this saying that i find it extremely true - it takes two years to build up a friendship, but takes only two days to break it. The only way to test it is to remain silent. Try it. It is accurate!"

"event","the hectic semester is finally coming to an end. many many late and sleepless nights. results are... ok but not really to my expectation. oh wells. projects are worst, for the first time, i dreaded project meetings, i dreaded doing all those researches, i dreaded everything about projects. i know i hadnt been doing well in my grp, but i will try harder next sem. and i am sorry to all my grp members ): one more week, just 7 more days, and i will be done with all my project presentations. really really looking forward to it.

many things have changed ever since the start of sem. from combining classes to the entire study sem. i feel somehow out of place, or rather dreading sch more and more. going to sch is like a chore to me now, and not something that i would be looking forward to. 

3 years ago, when i made that decision to leave that&nbsp;prestigious sch that would guarantee me a degree, to a sch now that would give me a diploma and an unguaranteed future. sometimes, i do regret my decision. but 3 years on, i have since realised that i have made the best decision ever. it is not studies that made up everything, everything else do matters. but have i cherished it?

it is hard to find&nbsp;gold among all those waste,&nbsp;needless to say,&nbsp;i did found some throughout the 3 years. but sometimes, gold can turn stale if is it not kept properly. but it is also the owner's fault for not taking good care of it. as a owner, i do have to make decisions to throw some away and to keep the rest. but the irony is, just when i was about to keep the good ones, they started to turn stale, just when i was about to use my heart, they broke my heart into pieces, just when i was about to lower down my guards, they broke my trust. 

i need a break, to sort through my thoughts before stepping into this cruel world with no trust. i just cant lower my guards down yet. i need to look at things at a new perspective now."

LOL. BUT.. the best thing happened during the movie. damn. so. the theatre was actually filled. so our seats were actually 2nd row from the front. hard to watch huh. got to tilt my head in a weird position to make it comfortable. ok nvm. thats not the point. HALFWAY&nbsp;THROUGH&nbsp;THE&nbsp;MOVIE, there is this little girl around 4, WEARING&nbsp;RED, STANDING&nbsp;beside my seat, STARING&nbsp;AT&nbsp;ME!!!! O.O bloody hell, obviously i was freaked out. damn it. asked hs whether she saw. and luckily she did. she told me the little girl has done that a few times alr and previously she was staring at the person behind me. gosh. i was kind of scared yknow.

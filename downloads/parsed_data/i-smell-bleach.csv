Well, let's see...what have we all missed? Um, quite a bit... oO

 My new obsession with Moulin Rouge, my strange problems with meh dad (but that's commen, isn't it?) and all that tamato and cheese.

So what shall I say? Oh, nothing much, as everything I wish to say is better left unsaid. Everything that I wish I could share are things that I can only share with those closest to me. My deepest thoughts and most well hidden secrets are only for ears I truely trust. =^.^= Sorreh, but I don't know who reads this anymore...so my thoughts will remain saved somewhere on my computer....oO If I can find them now x3

So, instead

Read this! A song! x3

On With The Show, Moulin Rouge


Satine:
I was a fool to believe
A fool to believe
It all ends today
Yes it all ends today

Spoken 
Zidler: 
Send Christian away. Only you can save him.
Satine: 
He'll fight for me.
Zidler: 
Yes, unless he believes you don't love him.
Satine:
What?!
Zidler: 
You're a great actress, Satine. Make him believe you don't love him.
Satine:
NO.
Zidler: 
Use your talent to save him! Hurt him. Hurt him to save him. There is no other way. The show must go on, Satine. We're creatures of the underworld. We can't afford to love.

Today's the day
When dreaming ends

Zidler:
Another hero. Another mindless crime.
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime.
On and on
Does anybody know
What we are living for
Whatever happens
We leave it all to chance
Another heartache
Another failed romance
On and on
Does anybody know
What we are living for

The show must go on
The show must go on
Outside the dawn is breaking
On the stage that holds
Our final destiny
The show must go on
The show must go on

Satine:
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

The show must go on
The show must go on

I'll top the bill
I'll earn the kill
I have to find the will to carry
On with the
On with the
On with the show

On with the SHOW!
On with the SHOW!

The show must
The show must go on"

My head hurts and I keep hurting myself...YAY! 
Other than homework overload/tutoring(useless tutoring) overload and lack of sleep I'm fine ^^
nbsp;
Finally&nbsp; managed to get my dad off my back...until Tuesday...<lj-cut text=""psst...here....x3""><BR>when he somehow managed to come up with another way to make me feel guilty in his attempt to get me to come to his house. Luckily, I was half dead from homework so I didn't quite catch what he said and felt no guilt for whatever it was. ^^;;<BR>It's really quite sad, really. After all this time he still doesn't believe a word I say. Everything is my fault...still.... &lt;.&lt; &gt;.&gt; It's obnoxious!!<BR>Yeah... &gt;.&gt;<BR>Ramtin molested me twice...and somehow it's my fault...<BR>Yeah! It's my fault for being female, naive and trusting...<BR>His new wife (my stepmom) left him because he accused her son of touching me...and she was accused by&nbsp; my counselour of being abusive towards me...It's, again, my fault...<BR>&gt;.&gt; I have to take tutoring because I don't understand math....my fault...and I'm lying... 
his logic is impecable... &lt;.&lt;<BR>And he wonders why I don't want to visit him...hmmm...<BR>Well, everything being my fault helps...and the fact that he's never there anyhow! Either on the phone, internet or out and about with friends...People I should be friends with too...even though they dislike me for ruining my dad's marraige. I'm the tattle tale! Shame on me...I should have kept my mouth shut and let it go...Yeah..riiiiiight...<BR>.............................i can't wait to tell him I'm bi................that'll go over like a ton of bricks..........
Baabaa, I'm bi
::BOOOM::
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!!

I don't know what's up with me at this moment...but I feel pretty down...all I need is some time alone...but my mom seems to dissagree.....Tellin' me to call my dad. My dad...a man who could care less about how I'm feeling...Cause I'm supposed to help him with his problems... >_> Its annoying...I'm expected to help a man that never cared about my problems...I'm only 15...well, I will be 15 soon....It's just not fair...

My ears are bleeding again... .-. I wish it would stop...but they're still healing and stuff....oh well...

My weekend was a blast! x33 Megu and I rotted our brains in front of the computer....But I have a pounding headache right about now that's slowly ruining the rest of my weekend.... .-.

I want to just...become nonexistant(baaaad word..did i even spell it right?) or something...

"event","Nothing happened today, I mean it...>< Absolutely nothing!! But what can I expect from my dad's house?? That's how it's allways been, but now it's slightly different. Now I actually enjoy being with my dad but we never get the chance, now I enjoy talking to him but I can't when my stepmom is around. I feel so uncomforatable(sp? O_o...see? I DO need an english education...>< lol) I mean...Well,

Here's how it goes:

  My dad and my stepmom had gotten in a fight and my dad had to take me to my mom's house(this happened like 3 weeks ago). So, as he was telling me to get my stuff, she continued to yell at him in Parsi. When I went to go say goodbye to her, she yelled in clear english ""I hate you!"" Now tell me, what kind of a person after hearing that would just go up to their stepmom and act like nothing was said and say good bye??? Well, I didn't!! You can bet on that!!!

  So as we were heading into the car, she comes storming out and yells at me. She was like, ""What did I do?? Do you hate me??"" 

This left me very baffled, I just asked, ""What do you mean??""

And she continued with, ""What did I do to make you hate me?? You don't even want to say goodbye to me??? What happened?? Why do you and your dad hate me.""

My thoughts consited of, 'um....you were yelling at him, if anything you hate him....' and 'shut up...shut up.....shut up.....shut up....shut up'

But I said nothing, to scared....I'm a wimp...><

My dad stood up for me though and they got in another fight

then she

she

of all things to piss me off
she reached the top one

she hit my dad


ok, it my not have been a harmful hit, a small one on the arm


but still

she hit him
i don't like that at all

And then as we were leaving she called him continuesly.....

So, they expect me to act like nothing happened

Like hell I can do that

Who could???

Whatever

Any suggestions???

Please tell me!!! ><"

"event","im stuck in endless time replaying the things weve said
breaking my heart all over again.
to bad i just cant rewind and play it out, change the ending.
i guess ill just spend this endless night deing inside
letting my pain show thru my tears down my cheek, they hold loss for you.
to bad i cant rewind, im stuck in endless time.

"event","light is fading from my eyes, carried with my tears down my face, tempt me and i might do the deed, let my life flow to the gound down by my feet. lying in my own blood dieing with these sorrows."

"event","If you search for tenderness
it isn't hard to find.
You can have the love you need to live.
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind.
It always seems to be so hard to give.

Honesty is such a lonely word.
Everyone is so untrue.
Honesty is hardly ever heard.
And mostly what I need from you.

I can always find someone
to say they sympathize.
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve.
But I don't want some pretty face
to tell me pretty lies.
All I want is someone to believe.

Honesty is such a lonely word.
Everyone is so untrue.
Honesty is hardly ever heard.
And mostly what I need from you.

I can find a lover.
I can find a friend.
I can have security until the bitter end.
Anyone can comfort me
with promises again.
I know, I know.

When I'm deep inside of me
don't be too concerned.
I won't as for nothin' while I'm gone.
But when I want sincerity
tell me where else can I turn.
Because you're the one that I depend upon.

Honesty is such a lonely word.
Everyone is so untrue.
Honesty is hardly ever heard.
And mostly what I need from you."

"event","I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stain of time
The feeling disappears
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become?
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way"

"event","At the top of the stairs
There's hundreds of people
Running around to all the doors
They try to find
Find themselves an audience
Their deductions need applause

The rich man stands in front of me
The poor man behind my back
They believe they can control the game
But the juggler holds another pack

I need someone to believe in, someone to trust
I need someone to believe in, someone to trust

I'd rather trust a countryman than a townman
You can judge by his eyes, take a look if you can
He'll smile through his guard
Survival trains hard
I'd rather trust a man who works with his hands
He looks at you once, you know he understands
Don't need any shield
When you're out in the field

But down here
I'm so alone with my fear
With everything that I hear
And every single door
That I've walked through
Brings me back here again
I've got to find my own way

The priest and the magician
Singing all the chants that they have ever heard;
And they're all calling out my name
Even academics
Searching printed word

My father to the left of me
My mother to the right
Like everyone else they're pointing
But nowhere feels quite right

And I need someone to believe in, someone to trust
I need someone to believe in, someone to trust

I'd rather trust a man who doesn't shout what he's found
There's no need to sell if you're homeward bound
If I choose a side
He won't take me for a ride

Back inside
This chamber of so many doors
I've nowhere, nowhere to hide
I'd give you all of my dreams
If you'd help me
Find a door
That doesn't lead me back again
Take me away"

Reading through my sister's journal entry about being 14, I realized that we were two totally different people.  Then I look back and remember how hard I tried to be like her, and my heart cracks, like a crack in a window.  Then I think, maybe that's why we are so close now, because we are so different.  I was too afraid to do most things she did.  Afraid of what would happen if my parents found out, especially my dad. I have always kinda been afraid of him. But I still love him.

I am getting really tired of 2 study halls in one day, i sure hope that open study halls kick in soon. i think that our parents need to contact the school and tell them that its ok for us to leave study hall though."

"event","well, mom, there was a lot that happened, kinda like one thing after another, its just another soap opra thing, it started with Goldburg, Vince, Austin, and the Smackdown GM, some idiot i dont know his name. Last week Austin went to Goldburg and said that he had a front row ticket to Smackdown's PPV on the 15th. Well, Goldburg took it because of Brock Lesner, who cost Goldburg the Royal Rumble. Of course he took the ticket so then last night the idoit and vince came out and told goldburg that he could not go on sun and then austin came out just so he could get his 2 cents in, and well at the end goldburg knocked out the idiot and then was going to knock out Vince, but he moved so he knocked out Austin. later, goldburg went to austin to appologize and vince went to eric bishoff to tell him the goldburg is suspended. life went on, there was a match and then Kane came out, beat up some poor guy who is like 1/2 his size. At the end of the match this whole ""The Ring"" thing started again, but then there was a sign that read ""in 34 days, the dead will rise again"" this was meaning that during Wrestlmania 20, which is in 34 days, well 33 now, that undertaker will rise again after Kane barried him alive. then there was going to be a contract signing between HHH and Chris Benot, who was on smackdown, he won the Royal Rumble and beat flar in a match. anyways...HHH spoke and Chris was about to sign and the HBK, who really wants to kill HHH and really wants the belt and wants to do it at Wrestlemania 20 came out. HBK told Chris that he was going to go against HHH and not Chris, Chris of course didnt agree and when he was trying to talk to HBK (chris really likes, or liked, HBK) HBK knocked him out with his sweet chin music, which shocked a lot of people and left HHH smiling, then HBK signed the contract, which he cant really do bc chris won the right to face HHH for the world championship. but yet he did and bishoff doesnt know what he can really do about it. so bishoff goes up to chris and says that he will face hbk one on one next monday, i dont know if this made chris happy or what he just looked at bishoff. and i just sit in my bed saying ""why dont you make it a triple threat match""

see it is one bis soap opra"

"event","ok some people really need to grow up a little, or do something. i swear, its just nasty. People tell me to say hi to someone, acting like they really care when you can tell they dont give a fuck bc if they did then they would pick up the goddamn phone and call, or go and see this person. its so fucking dumb, but i just walk away and say whatever dude.
all i know is that on thurs. when there are a bunch of people i dont really care to see or speak to at my house, i will hide in my room. i refuse to come out, i really do. maybe ill go get drunk or something. ill have to do somehing. maybe i should just skip school fri and go home on thurs, but that will never work bc then i would prolly have to walk and i would end up somewhere else instead of Courtenay. I have to think of something.
69 more days of school left and like 106 more days until i graduate
this is way too long and people are telling me its going fast
people dont know what they are talking about.

I was in the hall today, and i noticed that even the teachers backstab each other. all i could think of was, what the ----!? i couldn't believe that the teachers would be nice to each other to their faces and then once they left they would go to another teacher and talk bad about them. No matter where i go this happens and it is awful, i really need to get out of this place. I hope that when i get to college it is not the same thing, if it is, i will find a different college out of the MN, ND area.

Ok and get this, for our senior skip day, #1 we are prolly going to have it this month and go skiing bc no one knows how to ski and #2 we have to take a class trip. haha. screw that i am not going anywhere. I will stay home and do whatever the hell i want and if the school cries about it, well then they cry about it. it is all pathetic.

i think i am just going to go home and go to bed, or something. i don't want to see anyone but my family."

Selfless, powerful, and<br>divine, you are one blessed with a certain<br>cosmic grace. You are unequalled in<br>peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of<br>Light your wings are massive and a soft white<br>or silver. Countless feathers grace them and<br>radiate the light within you for all the world<br>to see. You are a defender, protector, and<br>caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver<br>of the wrong, chances are you are taken<br>advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often.<br>But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in<br>everyone and so this mistreatment does not make<br>you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will<br>try to help misguided souls find themselves and<br>peace. However not all Angelics allow<br>themselves to be gotten the better of - the<br>Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting<br>for the sake of Justice and protection of those<br>less powerful.

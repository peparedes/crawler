With the rain pooring down as hard as it can, i sit in bed bed thinking in my head, thinking of you and the good times we shared, wishing you were here and not up there. i miss those days we spent together, i miss the times we laughed at eachother. why did he have to take you on such short notice? we werent prepared, it came as a shock, it happened so fast then we all fell apart. now four months has past and we still cant believe your gone, we still keep holding on, until that day we can be together, in my heart youll stay forever."

he was quite the cool...
everyday he hung out with his friend after school
but one day he meet rachel and she was quite the cooler
and after that jordan became the loser..
but then he returned with a smile on his face
and walked right up to rachel and brushed her hair with tooth- paste...
so now hes still the coolest kid of them all..until there came the kid named justin runnin along...

hi my name is justin
i came from outer space
i met this guy name jordan
who brushed rachel's hair with toothpaste
we say were quite the cool
because we went to school
but i cant think of anything else to say
because rachel is so coolerifictitisolasococool"

And I want to fall on through
Out of the real world to a happy day
Out of the wreckage that I do

I keep on dreamin because I can even though my eyes don't close
I keep on trippin because its free to a place I only know
I keep on dreamin because I can even though my eyes don't close
I keep on slippin out of this life

Still my hand won't go to the other side
My boney fingers stay locked here
The glass is cold when I touch my face
But I can taste my salty tears

I keep on dreamin because I can even though my eyes don't close
I keep on trippin because its free to a place I only know
I keep on dreamin because I can even though my eyes don't close
I keep on slippin out of this life waiting for the drapes to close

Mirror mirror won't you kiss my cheek
And tell me I'll be OK
And warm my spirit with your sugar lips
And help me wait for another day"

The way you really feel 
What you don't say 
You know your eyes reveal 
I'm knockin' at your door 
So open up your heart 
You know I'm what you really want 
So what you waitin' for?
Keepin' it all inside 
When it should be you and I 
What's the point of keepin' it to yourself?
If you're savin' for a rainy day 
Then let me be the rain 
If you're lookin' for a love that's true 
Then baby look my way 
If you're hopin' for a miracle 
Then I can be your wish 
If you're savin' for a rainy day 
Then baby here it is
But there you are 
Standin' by yourself 
Too shy to ask 
But you know I can tell 
That what you really, really, 
really, really need 
Is what I really got to give 
But baby you will never know 
Until you let me hear"

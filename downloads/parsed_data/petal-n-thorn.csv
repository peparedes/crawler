Am opening this one all the way up. Anon commenting ONLY. 

Tell me anything. Tell me your secret, ask me a question, say the thing you've always wanted to, even if it's not to me. Probably will be a one time thing, will never ever do again."

"event","I am cutting someone from my friend's list. I don't want to go into particulars. Just know that this person has proven themselves to be both ethically and legally irresponsible. I want nothing more to do with this person until this person has actually resolved the current situation. 

This has been a really, <i>really</i> sucky week for me, as well as for all concerned. I may be disappearing from LJ for a while."

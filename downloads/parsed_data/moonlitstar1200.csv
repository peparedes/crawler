Hard, but good. :)  I have Mrs. Mataysec for U.S. History, and my sister had her and said it's a total blow-off class and totally easy, but there's still 5 other non-blow off classes I have to worry about! Oh well... anybody got feedback on which pic i should use for my icon?

"event","Yea HI! It's been such a long time since I've written in here, but I guess it's not that big a deal since no one reads this except for my friends who already know just about everything I write in here! lol

So what's new with me? Nothing really... I guess I like four people which is stupid and crazy especially because none of those people like me which is sad. There's drug Mike (I guess it's good he doesn't like me), Mark (and now he's going out with the AMAZING Chryssa.. joy..), A.J. (I have no side note for him), and Mike R... I like him the most. He's in my english class and I don't know exactly how he feels but I know we are friends and his on-and-off girlfriend that he really really likes broke up with him not too long ago. So that's probably not that great :-/

But anyways! Today was the Anime Reactor and that was FUNNN!!!!!!!! :D Me and Shannon wore our boots and we looked oh so slutty lol. There was drama tho b/c Lamy and Stupid Mike went into the art room and me, shan, and chris went around the corner to the bathroom and then they couldn't find us and Lamy was really upset :( me and shan and chris went on our own and lamy went with mike but later lamy was really happy caz she met this artist who knew of her!! :) yay! lol ok so me shan and chris are just kinda walking around and chris notices these three guys lookin at as and we walked past em and they started following us!!!! It was like OMG THIS IS A CHANGE!!! usually WE'RE the stalkers, but today we were the stalked! we finally just stopped walking and sat down around a corner and when the walked past they were surpirsed to see us sitting there. they said they were seniors, but they didn't look like it. the first thing they asked us was if we smoked or drank. so yea i think they were just lookin for sum. anyways they are from naperville and they asked us to hang out with thim so we did for a little we went into the game room and just stood there and talked. i was like so incredibly shy just because like thye're seniors and i knew in my mind it probably wasn't a good idea to be going off with them, but it wasn't like we'd be leaving the building. they seemed pretty nice. ne ways the leader guy i guess Jim split up between his friends and shannon made me play the piano which i didn't want to caz it's not like he cared but watever i did and then like his friends came up to him and were like give me ur keys and so he did and then he's like well i'm gonna go see what my friends are doing to my car and i'm like well we gotta go downstairs to meet up with are friend (and it was true) and he was like oh i see how it is and i was liek no really and he's like no no i see u dont wanna hang out with me and like walked away but kept looking behind him as if he was trying to see if we were following him but luckily we didn't. the scarey thing is.. i wanted to. it's like i've never been approached like that and it made me feel like special but like it wasn't even worth anything caz it seemed like they were drunk or high and like they just wanted some. it was probably planned for his friends to ""go to his car"" so we would go with. but i wanted them to come back. it's sick.... ugh it's just so sick.

but... before this there was a guy dressed up as Vash from Trigun and shannon was saying before how like she really liked that character so when i saw him i asked to take a pic of him on shannon's camera and then he asked shannon for a hug and she was all happy and then i went up to him and said hey u know the girl in the white boots and he's like yea and i'm like can u write down ur s/n for her and he's like yea! lol it was so cute and like he came over by us a few times and then like me and shannon were sitting alone on a couch and he came over and he was like can i have another hug and i took a pic of them together it was sooooooooo cute! and then he left and came back and there were like these girls chasing him caz they wanted him to kiss sum guy and he sat on the couch next to shannon and like put his arm around her and he was like no i like her not the guy and it was just sooooo adorable!!!! sooooooooooooooo adorable! :) and like he kissed her on the cheek lol and he asked her for a kiss at sum point and she kissed him on the cheek and he seemed dissapointed and he told her she was the prettiest girl there and he didn't want her to leave and it was just *sigh* if i was shannon i wouldn't have left lol

maybe someday that will be me :)"

"event","Well, yesterday was homecoming. Lamy and Shannon came over to get ready with me and then we went to Karen's house for picutres. Chris gave me, Lamy and Shannon flowers which was so sweet of him. Then we got there. And it was all downhill from there. I'm just so pathetic. I barely saw my friends the whole time i was there. God, some girl was sitting on Mike's lap and then later it looked like Mike was standing behind some girl with his arms around her. When the dance was almost over and I finally got enough courage to fucking go up to him during <u>I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing</u>, it was too late. I went up to him in the second verse and was asking him if he was having fun and he murmerd something like ""yea"" or ""i guess"" or sumthin along those lines. He said I kept looking at him weirdly. He said he was leaving after the song was over. Hey right there should have been a clue to start dancing but no.. I'm stupid. I thought,<i> No he can't be leaving. He'll still be here. </i> He said that that was like the first time he saw me all night, and he saw me like one other time on the opposite side of the gym, but when he looked again I was gone. This kid is so shaddy. We were walking down the hallway in opposite directions earlier, and I don't see how he couldn't have seen me. I saw him a million times that night. I guess it just shows that he wasn't looking for me... it's so confusing he said ""u better"" when i said I'll see you later tonight.. i dont know he said save me a dance but i never danced with him. these precious things... so insignificant and overdramatized. it's not a big deal.. so i didn't dance with him OMG WOW OH NO but it's really upsetting to me I dont know why. I just felt like such an idiot. The song ended and Mike was walking away and I was like blocking him and he was like pushing me away. i was like i can't break a promise and he's like u can and i'm like u can't leave that's not fair and he's like no it's fair. i don't understand him. when we were talking he was like ""hey i said more than three words"" meaning he remmeber how i said ""i've never heard u say more than three words before"" i just felt so stupid i went up to his ride home and was like ""here's the thing"" as i'm standing in front of mike holding onto his tie.. god he was probably like pissed off at me... ""i promised this guy i would dance with him and if u leave now i wont be able to"" and the guy was like umm it's up to her (his date) and the girl was like... i gotta go. god mike was probably like shaking his head to not stay or like mouthing no lets go. After that I was all upset and talked to shannon and lamy about it and then i went back in the gym in hopes of finding mike back there for a dance and i got fucking stepped on. really badly. It still hurts. there's still a mark. 

<B>WHY DO I GET THIS WAY WITH GUYS?!?!</B> I just start to like them SOOOO much and it's like they don't even like me at all in return. Why can't they just fucking like me? What is wrong with me? What is this horrible quality that drives them away from me at 100 miles an hour? It just really gets me down about myself. 

I was thinking maybe things happen for a reason. It's a good thing that Mike doesn't like me, in reality. I don't want to be going out with a heroine addict. But it's like, not even a heroine addict finds me attractive! I dunno this is all so fucking stupid

Hopefully it won't be that bad, but I have a feeling the ""getting ready"" and ""eating"" part will be the highlight of the evening, which is okay caz that'll be really really fun. I just hope the dance doesn't like block those memories from my head lol alirght... ne ways Mike is going now I guess. His parents are letting him off the hook so we shall see what happens."

"event","I hate drugs. They ruin people's lives. Not only do the ruin the people's lives who are on them, but they effect the people around that person. Mike is so fucked up. He's just weird and so hard to figure out and it's FRUSTRATING. And it's like, I keep going back to that whole rant... how it's my fault. Mike doesn't like me, Mark doesn't like me, Jay doesn't like me, Connor doesn't like me (that's actually kinda a good thing.. but then again if he did I could laugh in his face! and <b>THAT</b> would be a good thing.), Letis Boi doesn't like me, and so on. Actually, when I think about it, no guy has actually liked me without me liking them first and ""persuing"" them, except for that one guy Adriene from guitar. I don't know, it just sucks really bad and makes me feel bad about <i>myself.</i> I know it's really stupid, but that's just the way I feel. The thing is, it's even worse than before, because (1.) it's just another guy to add to the list of rejectors (if that is a word.. what i mean is like people who reject me...) and (2.) it's worse to like Mike than Mark because Mike is fucking addicted to heroine, he smokes, and God knows what else he does! 

Well I feel proud now b/c Mark invited me into a chat room with like 7 ppl, just because he wanted to feel special pretty much. So I left and said this before leaving (oh and I know it's true because Mark said it to Tim in homeroom the other day):
<i>the only point to this room is so mark can feel like he is popular and has o so many friends and oh so many girls. after all, all the girls he went out with last year were just there, and he just went out with them caz he was new and wanted all the girls to like him and all the guys to hate him</i>

Whoooh go me, fighting temptations of liking Mark. I think that's proof that I just don't give a rat's ass about him anymore! :)

I'm not in so much of an irritated mood now because of the chat room with Lams and Shanni, and the fact that I'm proud of myself for dissing Mark! YAY! BUT I STILL HATE DRUGS AND WANT THEM TO DIE.

Really, when you think about it, how can the police and government and all those people allow drugs to be around and for KIDS to have access to it so easily. It's fucking rediculous. REDICULOUS..... oh no I'm getting irritated again :-/"

I don't know it's like... either he's telling the truth about the whole situation and avoiding me because he feels bad (which is stupid because it makes me feel worse) or he's lying about it and thought about going with me and doesn't want to go anymore. Or maybe everything will work out and everything will be wrapped up in a nice little package (sarcasm).

"event","God yesterday was so awesome. I talked to Mike online and he asked me to homecoming and all was wonderful. Today I went out shopping with Lamy Shanni and Chris and I bought a really cool dress. It's just one of those little black dresses and the reason I bought it was because I didn't want to be too dressed up for Mike. The dress I was planning to wear was pretty fancy. So I paid $50.89 of my own money. I tried both dresses on at home and took pictures to let him decide perhaps. Anyways, Lamy and Chris are on the computer and Mike is online and they started talking to him crazyily and he asked to talk to me. He told me he can't go to homecoming with me because he's grouned. His parents found a bag of ?weed? in the atic or something that isn't his. He said something like ""Steve (his friend) can tell you the story, he was there and my parents kicked him out"" an I was like ""I believe you"" and he's like ""Ok. I'm gonna take an advil and go to bed lol"" and it's like ok... I don't know now if I believe him or not. I've had a BAD past with guys so I'm paranoid now. But who would be sick enough to make up a lie like that? I don't know but I'm really disappointed. 

<B>I HATE WHEN I GET LIKE THIS!!!!!</B>

When something bad happens I think of everything bad and get so depressed. GOD WHY AM I CRYING?!?! I don't even KNOW him. If he really isn't lying, there might be a slight possibility that his parents would let him go after things cool down. But maybe he doesn't want to go with me. Maybe he thought about it and was repulsed at the thought of going with me! I wouldn't doubt it. It's like what Jay did last year at Turnabout. Why can't it work out, just once? WHY? IT DOESN'T WORK OUT FOR ANYONE. I'm gonna go now..."

"event","The subject of homecoming has been on my mind a lot lately, but I haven't really sat down and sorted through all my thoughts. So since I have nothing else to do, I'm gonna do that right here and right now.

At first I didn't want to go unless Mark asked me (or possibly Mike from Guitar) just because I knew that if I didn't have a date it wouldn't be as fun. Except I didn't really want to take the time to get to know Mike simply because it reminded me of last year with Mark. I see this guy for all of 5 minutes who is cute and seems pretty cool, and because I'm so desperate to be in a relationship I start to like him (based on nothing at all). I just don't want to make another mistake or another heartbreak. Wow now I'm getting so sappy I'm starting to rhyme... 

A day or so later I tried on this dress that was a dress that Laura had for one homecoming. It's so pretty and elegant. It has simple spaghetti straps and the top and back is just a simple tube top cut. It's full length and straight. It's silver and has a sort of shimmer too it. The patter of it is like there is a lighter silver thread or whatever you want to call it all over the dress in like pieces and it looks like broken glass almost. Hmm now that I think about it I like the symbolism of that... broken glass.... Anyways after trying that dress on it made me REALLY REALLY want to go! The thought of dressing up and looking all nice and pretty sounded fun to me. 

But when you think about it, I have no one who I like and who likes me back. So if I go I'd be hanging out with my friends. Now Lamy has a date with Stupid Mike, so I'd probably be hanging out with Shannon. Or Shannon, Lamy, and Stupid Mike. But Shannon wouldn't wanna be in the gym most of the time and S.M. would wanna dance with Lamy so she'd probably have to go in with him and I wouldn't wanna leave Shannon and I wouldn't wanna see all the happy mother fuckers... but I'd wanna go in and possibly have fun. Mark probably won't even go and if he does he'd probably go with that girl <i>Jenine</i>. So either way I'm not gonna be slow dancing with anyone. And Lamy would have S.M. and if Mark did go or if I even had anyone to dance with Shannon already said she didn't want to be in their during any slow dances and I can't leave her alone in the commons eating. Okay another thought occurred to me. IF I went with Mark (which 99.9999999% won't be the case) then I'd either wouldn't be able to spend the night with him or I wouldn't be able to spend the night with Lams and Shanni. See with S.M. he doesn't really have that many friends at Stagg since he doesn't go there anymore. He'd be there for Lamy and only Lamy. But Mark has ""friends"" and I know he would want to like hang out with them. I wouldn't be the one he's there for. UGH he'd probably be flirting with all these hoes too. And that'd probably be the case if I went with Mike too. He has his friends I dont even know him and he doesn't know me or my friends hmm that isn't even gonna happen so why am I wasting people's time and my space with even typing about it?!?!?!??!?!?! I guess Rich might hang with us the night... oh.. did I mention I'd go with Rich?... heh.... heh heh... Hi Lamy... Hi Shannon... I think I like Rich. WHICH IS CRAZY BECAUSE HE'S A FRIEND AND IS SO STUPID SOMETIMES AND STUFF... I think out of the three guys Rich would be my only chance just caz. But he has a g/f... who he doesn't even like so they'll probably break up before then. Hmm well I'm done. 

I guess as of right now I'll go.

But I'm likely to change my decision in the next five seconds so I'm still not sure!"

Mark's ujournal. A few days ago he told me if he goes to homecoming he's going alone, and that's IF he goes. I guess he might not be going alone after all... I have to get over him this is just getting old. He's not even boyfriend material because I know I couldn't trust him. He lies a lot. The only thing there is physical atraction and that's so shallow. I'm disgusting myself!!!! This has seriously got to stop. I don't love him. He's sooooo not worth my time. Maybe I'll focus on that guy in guitar. He's pretty good looking and seems to be nice even though I've talked to him for a combined total of... 7 minutes? He's always smiling tho so that is a good sign. lol alright I want a date for homecoming :("

"event","Well Mike and Chris didn't come but that's ok. Soo my party was like really boring at first like all those parties I HATE to go to... but it got better!!! Okay, Chris put Hands Down on and I was just like ... let's turn this off and jen and him are like no why? and I was just like I dunno. So it's playing and it's like silent and Shannon looked so sad I could have cried from looking at her :( Shanni :( and like Jenny looked at me and mouthed ""what's wrong with shannon?"" and I just shurgged. It was such a sad moment though. lol if the mood would have been lighter I would have like ran up to Mark, wrapped my arms around him, and kissed him like I meant it hehe but nope that would have been bad cause of stuff and cause it was like so early in the party. After this tho it started to get better.

Okay so we started to play catch phrase and that is always fun. Then the pizza came and that was good. Then we went back downstairs, played a little more catch phrase, and then decided to turn on the Ring... and like on the couch was Chris, Jen, and me with space for one more person to squeeze in there. Mark sat down in the black chair and I was like nooo.. and Jenny could tell so she was like Karen is Mark in your way? and Karenn's like kind of so Mark moved his chair back and jenny and i just laughed and then he got up to get sumthing and went to go sit back down but i said like Mark, come here and he's liek where and i patted the sofa and was like sit here and maaaaan i'm glad i did lol.

So yea the movie's going and nothing between me and him are happening but like halfway into it he started like making masterbating motions with his hands liek he was jacking off an invisible dick and so i would grab his hand and put it down but then he would just do it again until i would like hold his hand still and then he wouldn't even try to move it...? hmmm so ne ways like when i would let go a little bit later he would do it again and then with his other hand to so i was like holding both hands and he was trying to get away just like cute messing around i dunno but yea lol i'm a dork. oh and i broke his lei caz he was jackin that off too so then i gave him mine and liek by the end of the movie when there was like i think 20 mintues left we were holding hands and i had my head on his chest. he smelled really good... just like he used to before. it was so comforting tho... i didn't want the movie to ever end. i was rubbing my thumb on his hand and then he did the same to mine..... i think that's a good sign? but he did want to keep the lights off after the movie ended... ;) lol during the movie before i had to go upstairs and when i came back down mark scared the crap out of me by hiding behind the wall at the end of the stairs and popping out when i came down. then after the movie the phone rang but it was kevin doing a prank i was mad lol but it was funny. ok so then we had dessert and then went downstairs and i opened gifts and like no one noticed at first which is good caz like it was only me and shannon and like when i opened marks card like there was sum thing i think it was a key chain or sumthing that said my name but it was spelled wrong... lol me and shannon were like laughing not at him but just like well i was laughing caz i was upset.. not liek upset upset but just like... i dunno i can't explain it i probably sound really mean but it wasn't like that. ne ways i opened my gifts :) i got chicago from chris, my fav moulin rouge poster from shanni and a tori amos cd, candle, and cow pic frame thing from lams! then karen was playing catch phrase with mark and he was like laying on a chair with his legs dangling off and i was standing behind the chair and he started doin that motion again so i like leaned over and had my hands on his i dunno hard to explain sooo then jen and karen left and it was just me shannon and mark and my mom was giving them a ride home so she droped off shannon and it was only me and mark in the car and like he said sumthing about how he didn't have ne money and he was gonna work today to get 20 bucks for a gift for me but then he wouldn't have been able to come to my party so he skipped work and then it worked out that his dad sent him money so then he could have my gift and  was just like.... aww omg that is so sweet and i was just like you didn't have to do that caz like his dad sent him 20 bucks and he gave me 15 and the keychain thing or whatever and then my mom was like where do u work and he's like i'm looking for a job... and it was like... what? and she's like oh didn't u just say u took off of work and he's like i dont know what i just said and then went into sumthing how he zones out when his mom yells at him and stuff i dunno but it was just like... the moment was killed and i dont know what to think or believe and i guess i'll just have to talk to him about it on monday if i see him but like yea oh and he gave me back my lei in the car he took it off of him and put it back on me so i dunno what i'll do with it... i guess i know i'll keep it lol but like then we got to his house and he asked for a hug before he got out of the car and then i went home... i hope tonight wasn't just like... some night that will never happen again and will be forgotten about by him or like what was running through his mind like i dunno i guess i just have never gotten over him and i hope he wasn't lying about taking off of work and i hope he likes me again and i hope we go out and i dunno that would just be so cool if on monday my bday he's like i have a present for u and its like a note that says like will u go out with me or like he kisses me and asks me out or sumthing i dont kown i'm rambling on about nothing!  NOTHING! i probably sound like some phsyco path but it's like as soon as he sat down on that couch next to me i could feel that rush coming back to me and it's just like such a great feeling i am so confused. and tired. goodnight.

<i>So she says everyone's going to the party. 
Won't you come if I come with a friend for your friend?
I'd be so pleased to see you out of the classroom,
wearing the smile that I'll bring you.
I was hoping to learn a few things like...
Do you, do you like dishing the dirt
on the whole class
or talking the big smack
or playing to fool
or wearing all of the latest fashions
or fucking the new trends
and wearing your old threads
or if you like coffee in the evening
these are a few things
that I'd like to know.

So I say... <b>I've been scheduled to work, but I'll call in</b>
And my friend isn't busy; he'd be happy to join me.
And maybe my friend and your friend will hit it off...
or maybe...... we will
I'm dying to know
Do you, do you like dreaming of things
so impossible
or only the practicle
or all the above
or waiting through all your bad, bad days
just to end them with someone you care about
and do you like making out
and long drives
and brown eyes
and guys that just don't quite fit in
Do you like them?

So yes, I'll see you there...</i>"

"event","There are so many people out there, but unfortunatly I only see one of those people. This morning Mark was at school which I thought at first was a plesant surprise, but he was talking to all these people... all these <i>GIRLS!</i> It's just like, he knows so many girls and could like ANYONE of them... it's like a mind game that makes me sick to my stomach! He sat at our table for all of 2 minutes maybe and then got up and talked to everyone else and it's just like... wtf! TALK TO ME, I LOVE YOU. I have a very strong feeling that he won't be coming to my party, but he HAS TO! It won't be as fun without him there... no offense!!! I saw him before 2nd and asked if he new and he said he's not ""100%"" sure if he has permission to go or something like that. Then later in the day I saw him and he seemed in a better mood. He walked and talked with Shannon and me. At the end of the day, though, Shannon and I were on the bus and I'm looking out the window and I see Mark standing at the edge of the street waiting to cross, skateboard in hand, and who should be next to him, but ASHELA! He liked her last year before we went out. Once she got a new boyfriend, I guess Mark settled for me? UGH I just hope he comes!

One thing concerns me though... If Jeff comes (if Jeff doesn't come then Kevin can't come) then I think it would ""cramp my style"" (as lame as that may sound). Jeff is so... goody goody and I'd just feel accward playing ""the cup game"" or whatever with him there or like hitting on Mark or... ANYTHING really! I don't know, I guess I'm just weird. Well I HOPE TO GOD that Mark calls me tonight and says ""I'd be so please to see you out of the classroom wearing the smile that I'll bring you""... good ol' Dashboard! *sigh* I'll tell you what happenes!"

"event","Today wasn't that bad AT ALL compared to yesterday. Last night Mark came online and IMed me while I was away. To make a long story short I talked to him later and he paid me a compliment by saying something like, ""Hey by the way you're lookin good! :)"" Anyways, later I read a little something on his online journal:

<i>Laura
20th August 2003 6:36pm
i just sent a email to laura telling her im breaking up with her, I seriously didnt want too but i had too.....Peace. </i>

Note: He IMed me 3 minutes after he wrote that in his journal. However, we have yet to find out WHY he ""had"" to do it. Tim tried asking him about it in homeroom, but I'll get to that later.

So anyways my birthday is on Monday, so on Saturday I'm planning to have a birthday party. Shannon and I were walking in the hallway after first period frantically looking for Mark, and (what do you know!) he comes up behind us and starts talking to us! I asked him ""Hey, you know my birthday is on Monday, so if I had a party on Saturday would you come?"" He said, quite sincerly that he'd definatly go. He gave me his new number because he moved and said to call him up sometime. Then in homeroom, the first thing he said to Tim was, ""Hey have you heard about Katherine's party?"" Tim of course knew about it and played it smooth by pretending he didn't know Mark and Laura broke up. He asked him, ""How does Laura feel about you going to an ex-girlfriend's party?"" and he said that they broke up. Tim doesn't have the best memory, but said that when he asked why they broke up, Mark said something very vauge like, ""something came up"" or ""something happened""... so we don't know!

ANYWAYS, I called everyone but Mark and invited them and all except Kevin are coming and Tim isn't sure yet. Then, I called Mark. I asked if he could come on Saturday night from 6-10:30. He asked if it was at my house and then said he'd ""try"" to and he'd call me on Friday or Saturday...? Last year before we went out he said he'd ""try"" but always wound up busy. I <b>REALLY, REALLY</b> hope he comes, though! It would make the party so much more... <i>interesting</i> hehehe...! Well we'll see I guess. He just signed online, and hopefully he'll IM me!"

"event","Yes, the day I've been dreading has come and gone. Going back to school was just sooo overwhelming. I have three classes where I don't have any friends in them. What's worse, Connor is in one of those classes. I am going to go to my guidance counslor tomorrow and asked to be switched into another English class, because I can't be in the same classroom with that sick fuck. I don't have any classes with Mark, but *OH BOY* I saw him ONCE today... actually twice... no three times! In the morning I waited with Shannon, Chris and Lamy out by the buses so I could see Margie and Lamy could see her friend Katie, and of course Mark walks by and... I got a hand raise and a slight movement from it which suggested he was trying to wave at me! YAY! Then I saw him in the hallway after second period and walked right past him, but I guess he didn't see me. Then when I was walking to the buses with Shannon I saw him again, and he walked right past me, but again, he didn't see me. Literally and figurativly I guess. Wow now he just signed offline, probably because his little whore who I like to call ""it"" isn't online. How sad for him. He said on his journal that this is the first girlfriend he's realllly liked and most other times he stops liking them after 2 weeks. Wait, lets get a direct quote:

<i>Laura
18th August 2003 6:15pm



Ok yester day I went over Laura's it was great we were just having a good time, No DETAILS lol. I'm soo happy with her, and it's been 2 weeks, WOW, usually im like hmmm i don't like her anymore.

"event","It has been so long since I've written in here... I guess I've been kinda neglecting my live journal. I think I haven't been writting in here because the only things I have to write about are the things I do and the things I have to complain about! Well I have new colours and I'm gonna go take a new picture as soon as I'm done writing this entry. I haven't talked to Tim or Jenny for a while because they are too ""wrapped up"" with each other. I was thinking about this the other day... before they were going out, Jenny would talk to me and so would Tim (mainly they'd talk about each other) and now that they're in their Happy Land it's like they don't need me anymore, or even their old friends like Lamy and Shannon and Chris. If everyone disappeard from the face of this world except for the two of them, I doubt they would notice! It's just so annoying... and upsetting. I mean, I feel like I have lost them as friends. I have seen Tim once over the summer and I've seen Jenny at the most three times. It just sucks and it makes me feel bad... and makes other people feel worse (you know who you are).

Okay enough about Tim and Jenny. I have to write a four page paper for my Renaissance final and it is due first thing Monday morning. There goes my idea to have a birthday party this weekend. I probably won't have one anyways. All the parties I go always suck (sometimes literally) and if I threw a party it would probably suck more than all of them... it would most likely be EMBARASSING! Besides, I probably only have 5 friends that would even come anyways. Oh wait, Tim and Jenny probably will be busy that weekend going to Culver or sumthing, so that makes three. I wonder if they will even remember that my birthday is a week from Monday... I'm not gonna say anything to them and see if they do anything or say anything to me on August 25th. Last year I made both of them a card! DAMNIT! I'm sorry, but it's just really dissapointing to realize that two people who were your friends don't care about talking to you anymore.

I can't get Mark off my mind. I wish I could just get over him, because I know he isn't even right for me... like if I had my choice to go out with him and.... um.... well I can't think of a person, but I would definately choose that person!... I guess I just have to find who that person may be."

"event","I had two doctor appointments today, back to back. First I saw my therapist, Joanne, and then I saw my physicologist from Linden Oaks. I told Joanne all about what happened with Connor and how my parents found out about that. I was holding back tears the whole time; it was like opening the wound back up. When I saw my physicologist she decided to increase my dosage of Lexapro from 10 mg to 20 mg. YAY more drugs. The medication isn't working so hey lets take some more of it. Right now I have a headache, stomachache, and an impulse to self injure. OH god I have to babysit tomorrow. I better go..."

"event","My parents are really starting to bug me. I'm too fucking passive. Two nights ago I sat there while they lectured me on how irresponsible I am. My dad even said to me that I was irresponsible with my last semster of school, and that made me so incredibly upset. They cannot even imagine how fucking hard I tried. The only reason I ""slacked off"" was because I was too depressed to try. When you're depressed, you feel worthless and when you feel worthless and have no energy, you physically cannot do hours and hours of pointless homework. I pulled of all A's and one C in a REALLY REALLY difficult class; and honors class. I'd say that isn't too damn bad. But do I mention this?.. No, of course not. If I do it wouldn't make a difference anyways. They are adding to my depression and they don't even realize it. The more they push the further I wish to retreat from them. My dad wanted me to come up with ""a plan"" to get all my finals completed since I haven't taken them yet and all this bull shit. When I told him my therapist, a professional mind you, said they shouldn't push me too much because it's my resonsibility and I WILL get it done without them nagging, he got pissed off and really mean. Tomorrow when he gets home from work we have a date to study, and if I dont make a plan and STICK to it ""there will be consequences"". And my mom thinks I'm unappriciative and all this crap. UGH it's just so annoying and stupid and upsetting and I can't even do anything about it. I just cannot wait to get out of my house."

"event","I went to see Legally Blonde 2 yesterday with Lamy, Shannon, Jenny, Karen, their friend Angie, and Tim. It was a good movie, but Jen and Tim got in a fight durring the movie (which I was unaware of until the movie already ended). It was just a continuation of what had been going on from the previous days. Anyways, that got me upset and quite angry when I stood over Karen and Tim sitting on the floor where Karen is telling Tim all these STUPID STUPID things and she didn't even know what the fuck she was even talking about. It just really pissed me off I guess. When I got home I went in my basement and layed there while I watched Now and Then. It was on TNT. I went up to bed around 1:15 because my mom made me. I just layed there with Walter, my sister's Beagle, and sobbed. It was like a hysterical cry and I just felt horrible. There were just so many thoughts that rushed through my head all at once, and it was almost uncontrollable... It was worse than before, too. However, I didn't go back to old habbits even though I really wanted to. It's an improvement I suppose..."

"event","Last night was fun with Lamy and Shannon. We played Dead or Alive 2 and Lamy kicked our asses as always and then we played Mario Party. That was cool. We stayed up kinda late till like 3 just talking... well I didn't talk that much 'cause I didn't really have much to say :| I don't understand why everyone has to go through so much pain -- I really don't. It's not fair. You hear people complain to you about their problems and of course you feel sorry for them, yet you stand there with so much more to be upset about and you can't even tell them. I'm sure none of you know what I'm talking about (I'm not talking about myself by the way). Today I went to the taste of Palos with Lamy, Shannon, Chris, Jen, and Karen. We sat and watched fireworks at Lake Katherine and even though I had all of them with me, it was one of the loneliest times I can remember. It sucks because not only do you feel bad for youself, but you feel even worse for your friends who are hurting and there's not a fucking thing you can do to help them. It's totally out of your control. I just want to scream sometimes. You know what still really bothers me? When I slept over at Shannon's house I stayed up really late talking to ""Mark"", or at least I thought it was him, and he was being really flirty and weird and acting like he really liked me again, and it made me so happy. I know it's pathetic, but it made me so god damn happy. I went to bed with a smile on my face. Even though that paranoid part in me thought it wasn't him, I basically made myself believe it was, and built myself up. GOD. I always set myself up for rejection. I hate it! I hate it so much. I hate the way I am. Everything about myself annoys me. I wish more than anything I could meet someone new and just GET OVER MARK because I'm an idiot. He doesn't care about me, and I pretend not to know this. He isn't the one and he isn't worth all of this time I'm spending on him but for some crazy reason I can't win. I don't think anyone can win in life. It is too fucked up."

I don't wanna go through the hurt and heartache of life just so i can reproduce and die. These last few days I've felt so down and I don't even know why... maybe I need to increase my meds!

Personality tests, purity tests, stereotype tests, political tests.

"event","Things change...i glimpsed at some past entries of mine...i used to be so impassioned.  

it's not like i'm apathetic <i>now</i> i guess i just grew frustrated with talking so much shit and being unable (emotionally or otherwise) to <b>do</b> anything.  never fear though...i got goals and more importantly--perhaps--i got <u>plans</u>.

in the past year, i've become a new entity, or at least a different version of the person i've always been.  

i think people still like me, the people that matter to me, anyhow. i feel guilty when i notice how i've let my stressed state and taxed emotional state affect my interactions with other people, people i love.  as the target of too frequently misplaced anger, i used to think this was one of the universe's worse crimes.  (i still do.) i would never allow myself to do that, not knowingly.  and now...but it's a funny thing, because it hasn't caused any problems.  i'm allowed to be human and fuck up and people understand and don't hold it against me--don't get it twisted i'm not abusing anyone.  but sometimes i'm harsher than i would be had i paid more attention. and...it's ok.  amazing.

increasing self-reliance.  i think i'm inclined equally towards introversion and extroversion.  lately i've been reveling in my solitude while simultaneously yearning for more human interaction--with more humans.  not that i don't love my friends but i think when your whole world is comprised of the same 7 people, life can get claustrophobic.

still struggling.  just...experiecing diffused energy cuz there are so <b>many</b> struggles.  i think once i get my life more properly aligned, i will be able to focus energy.  just gotta get past the next 2 days.

keep having these conversations about what love is, what love isn't.  love is something i have in abundance.  love is something i'm constantly searching for.  

what if i'm bi-sexual?  bi-amorous? that would really fucking suck.  i feel like that's a pandora's box situation, like if i never go down that road, i'll be straight...literally.

VERY much looking forward to going home.  you have no idea.  

Tuesday i will be in my cap & gown, taking a walk across a stage.  my name will be called.  no idea when i'll get my diploma...that depends on how sympathetic 2 of my professors are.  yes, it's come to this.  and i can't complain because...

as much as i would like to leave here with a diploma, the fact that i'm leaving at all is good enough for me."

"event","people make plans and God laughs. i look back on the plans i once had
and laughed at how nothing quite worked out that way, but everything
worked out some way.&nbsp; everything is <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">want want want</span>
but actually i'm quite content.&nbsp; i feel like the wanting/yearning
is the manifestation of the space in between who i am and who i desire
to become.&nbsp; i want the distance between the 2 to be bridged
by...things...i want to tesser (throwback to madeline l'engle &amp; <span style=""font-style: italic;"">a wrinkle in time</span>)
to avoid having to experience the distance, but it's a distance i have
to travel so..i guess i should get started.&nbsp; this is my form of
resisting change &amp; growth, wanting all these things,
everything.&nbsp; the fact is that i'm satisfied. looks like i'll
graduate and if i don't, it will be a matter of credits i can make up
at any other university (most likely wayne state), so i'm not too
concerned.&nbsp; maybe i should be more concerned but i'm not because i
lack motivation to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">do</span> because in my mind i'm already done.<br>
<br>
i think i'm back but i'm not sure...this was my first online journal
ever and i feel too invested in it to delete it...and regardless of who
i do or don't want reading me, well...here i am, back again :-)<br>
<br>
i have been up for 13 hours.&nbsp; i'm not sleeping until i complete
what i set out to do.&nbsp; i'm pushing myself because after Friday, I
have something of a respite.&nbsp; After Friday, I have a final, in
math...that I can study for and not fail. <br>
<br>
supposedly my cousin from milwaukee will be here on friday, but i doubt
it.&nbsp; i hate people that you can never count on.&nbsp; well, i
don't hate them, but it's just annoying when they make these promises
or guarantees and never come through...because sometimes i forget that
they are people that i can't count on, and i depend on them...and then
they fall through, and i'm annoyed or sometimes disappointed.&nbsp;
it's funny, i'm not even looking forward to graduation.&nbsp; i haven't
even thought about it.&nbsp; i have yet to pick up my cap &amp;
gown.&nbsp; i'm most looking forward to chillin with violeta in
nyc.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
violeta is...mi hermanita. we call each other sisters, and i consider
her to be a sister to me for reasons i can't quite explain, but i think
our relationship is different than a friendship.&nbsp; i consider mia
to be like a sister or older cousin at least to me too, not sure why
but it's just different than how i feel towards most of my <span style=""font-style: italic;"">friends</span>.<br>
<br>
anywho. it's that time where i will find any &amp; every way to try to
motivate myself to keep working. usually this centers on me allowing
myself to participate in some type of ongoing distraction (like snood
or sleep) after completing set amounts of work. tonight/this early
morning's distraction was me writing out what i want from an ideal
guy/relationship.&nbsp; it's really a topic i avoid, because i know
that after years of fantasizing there's a lot to say.&nbsp; so i never
really thought about it in depth. i might focus on ONE thing but not
everything.&nbsp; and i see why, because so far i have almost 2 pages.
single-spaced.&nbsp; if i had that much focus on these papers i need to
write, i would have been finished with everything weeks ago.&nbsp; but
i'm glad i picked this diversion for tonight/this early morning.&nbsp;
i'm going to save it and keep it handy for those times when i start
forgetting.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
i won't say i have unresolved issues with a certain someone.&nbsp; but
i will say that thoughts of someone from a year ago are resurfacing,
just because i want to ensure that i don't repeat the mistake.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
i'm really looking forward to going back home.&nbsp; i&nbsp; know i
will miss school friends.&nbsp; it's going to be strange knowing i
won't be back in september to see ""everybody"".&nbsp; but this epoch of
my life has reached its end, and it's time to move on.&nbsp; i'm sure
we'll find our way back to one another (permanently, not just to visit)
at some point.&nbsp; until then...there will be frequent e-mails, IM's,
&amp; phonecalls and less frequent visits.&nbsp; <br>

"event","about 2-3 years ago, i was having this conversation dennis.  he's 5 years older than me, so that would put him at around 23. he was talking about how he felt old, and stuff he used to regard as fun wasn't enjoyable anymore.  & how now, life for him was about living in a way that he wouldn't be embarrassed to tell his seed about, and that in terms of a relationship, he wasn't tryna be with a woman that he couldn't see raising his kids with.

those comments made a real strong impression on me, and i thought that was the ideal mindset to have--as an adult.  but since i wasn't claiming adult status at the age of 18, i put that on hold as a mindset to adhere to when i wanted to, but only then.

so the other day i hopped on some train of thought on some 2pac ""in the event of my demise"" shit thinking of what friends/family of mine i would want to be the godparents of my children. and...i was thinking...and thinking...and thinking...and besides my mom...i came up with 2 possibles.  i know that's not totally relevant now because 

1) don't have kids

 2)none of my friends are past age 25, so most of them have yet to become the people they are going to be.

still...it was some shit to think about, because 2 possibles means there were a lot that were definite ""NO's"". so if i definitely would not want these people influencing children of mine, why am i so ok with them influencing me?  i know inherent in all of this is my perfectionism...but still i think 85-100% of the time, you attract what you project, so i'm seeing that some part of this is a personal flaw...i started realizing the problem when i was looking at my male friends and realized that i would never date guys like them, for various reasons.  and i was like HMM...if i wouldn't date them...why am i friends with them? friendship requires more effort than dating...and that's why i now only have 2 close male friends... + 1 steve...because steve will just always be around *shrug*.

and now, thinking of female friends as god-mothers...i'm in the same boat, thinking that i really shouldn't be interacting so closely with people whose vibes i'm just generally not feeling. 

so that's what has me on quasi-hermit mode, and why i've been very selective about who i share <b>me</b> with, which includes why i haven't been updating."

"event","i just had the most random new year ever...no complaints though...i thank god i'm here...i'm about to go to sleep so i can wake up at something close to a decent hour.  going up to ypsi with moms...i guess she'll be driving since i don't want to hear her tell me how i need to go no more than 70 mph.  i spent new year's eve w/my mom, and then w/v & her boy from WSU, and then this cool ass (white) guy named Tom who was mad cool and is a great trumpet player, who i kinda left hanging--accidentally...then we went to a part of Detroit westside/highland park that i didn't actually know existed that is right by me to hang w/chris' fam...that was the most hoodish place i have ever been in.  maybe that's why i think the westside ain't shit and i would much rather stay on the East--the only places i've been to west of woodward have been SO fuckin hood...SO FUCKIN hood.  anyway, so we chillin over there...drinking some more (cuz we drank at her apt)...i got fucked up...i can tell i'm fucked up now, but it's throwing me off because i'm fully functional.  i didn't drink a whole lot for ME (cuz i can take quite a bit of liquor) but i had champagne, henn, bacardi rum, vodka, & some E&J.  and i don't feel shit...i mean i guess cuz i started drinking at 8pm w/my mom, but still...at the height of my drinking, didn't feel shit...i mean i could tell i was a lil hype-r, but that was the most i felt.  moving on...i realized that i will miss college a lot more than i realize, so i need to act like it.  and this was just a chill new year's, but i enjoyed it w/my sis.  our ""sister""hood is kinda random (i started calling her my sister cuz she reminded me of tasia in high school) but now...i really feel like that's my sister.  anyway.  paz y amor, happy new year's...no resolutions as of yet, except to stop trying to make up for lost time."

"event","i just realized that a friend of mine is really not a friend to me at all.  i realized this a while ago on a subconscious level and it manifested itself in the sense of being way less pressed to be in this person's company.  but the other day i was talking to my mom about said former friend and my ran me through the list of recent abuses and i was like OH YEAH...definitely not a friend.  
this is why i think i'm coldhearted, cuz i'm just dead on that shit now.  we've been through a bit together, and now i can honestly say that if i just never saw the person again...i wouldn't be greatly affected.  

so today i had drama w/my dad...and then got lost in the dark in a snowstorm.  the result was the purchase of a new cable knit sweater and much sobbing alone in the car. it was funny & pathetic at the same time.

  i think i done fucked around and got depressed again. or maybe today was just a really shitty day.  anywho, my goal over break is to clear my mind.  i was on that not really letting myself think or feel shit for a good portion of life since june or july...and now all the disappointments and losses and resentments are coming up at the same time.  so im just gonna sort that out.  but i think i might start taking (legal) drugs again, because it really was easier that way and i actually don't think i'm prone to becoming addicted to anything besides sugar...i'm tryna reduce my sugar intake...that junk is HARD son...it's such an integral part of my diet.   

my other goal for now is to make what's important to me have 1st priority in my life. i guess some people would call that focus."

You like partying and politics - and are likely to be young and affluent.

You're less religious, traditional, and uptight than most Democrats.

Smoking pot, homosexuality, and gambling are all okay in your book.

You prefer that the government help people take care of themselves.

"event","<b>preface:</b> i've never been in love.  it's not because i'm coldhearted.  it's because i'm 20, and though many fail to find the logic, i'm really a rather rational invidual.  as such, i understand that i will not know what it means or how it feels.  that's fine & dandy, i'm not asking about that.

<b>question (& background info):</b> a lot of friends & acquaintances who share their business with me are in that ex-factor situation.  they're no longer in a relationship with their ex.  perhaps the relationship ended months ago, maybe it's been a couple years.  for quite a few people this has to do with college & the long-distance thing, but for others that's just not the case.  and all these people say the same thing ""my ex treats me like shit"".  but then they say ""we might get back together soon"".  when i ask why, they say ""because i love him/her"".  

<b>clarification:</b>  i'm not asking how you can love someone who treats you like shit (that i actually understand quite well).  but what i am asking is why do you stick around when you know the situation is not going to improve?  why?

<b>hypotheses:</b> is it because you're hoping that somehow they will decide to become a better person and start treating you better?  hoping that if you stick around long enough they will see that you are ""the one""?  afraid that you'll never feel that same love with anyone else but the ex? do you prefer accepting shitty treatment to possibly *gasp* having to be alone for awhile, or investing yourself into a new relationship? afraid you'll never find anyone better? do people think the pain makes their lives richer & fuller somehow?

<b>reiteration of the question:</b> i just do not understand, can someone please explain to me why people stay (in one form or another) in these horrible relationships that cause such immense pain, or remain attached to people who treat them so terribly?"

"event","a people divided...

the columbia community was depressed today.  when kerry came on tv to announce his concession/conceding, everybody was watching it in tears, hugging & crying...it was JUST like watching september 11th on tv 3 years and 2 months ago...deja vu like a bitch.  people were taking pictures of everyone just staring in awe, teary eyed or sometimes sobbing.  

i was in a daze, standing there stupified with students and professors alike just fearful and depressed.

last night i got back to nyc.  my cab driver from the airport was listening to npr, but they were talking about the war in iraq, so i asked him if he knew anything about the election.  he said no, then asked where i was from.  he asked me how i thought michigan was gonna go--for kerry, or for bush.  my answer was that i didn't know.  before i got home i was like democratic, no question.  but after i got there, i heard the proliferation of pro-bush, anti-gay marriage ad's on both wjlb AND 105.9 and was DISGUSTED.  only to meet actual black bush voters in real life and wanting to WRETCH.

and yesterday, i was getting pretty fucking annoyed with people who jokingly or seriously told me i should have voted for kerry, <b>because no the fuck i shouldn't have</b> or were mad that i voted for nader--clearly these people are confused, <b>be mad at people who voted for bush</b>.  you know them, you see them, you interact with them every day.  holla at THEIR asses.  I, isis sushiela indirah smith, KNOW what the fuck is up. i KNOW bush is not about shit but fattenin his pockets & those of his homies.  i know this war was based on a lie, i know all he is doing is alienating us from the global community and making as MORE likely to suffer terrorist attacks reminiscent of 9/11, i KNOW that outlawing both gay marriage and abortion are next on his plate, i KNOW he wants to privatize EVERY FUCKING THING that should be a human right, i KNOW that renquist is gettin sick and bush will have the power to replace him with a religious right zealot.  i know ALL of this shit about bush, THAT is why i don't like him, and THAT IS WHY I DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIS ASS.  god damn that's the fucking end of that story.

forget all this electoral college shit.  if the estimates are any where near being close to correct, bush won the POPULAR vote by over 3 million.  3 mutha fuckin million.  be mad about THAT shit.  be mad that Kerry conceded when there were still hundreds of votes to be counted, when there were allegations of double voting in some florida counties, when there were allegations of voter intimidation in both ohio & michigan, be mad that college students from all over the states & abroad, who registered months in advance for their absentee ballots didn't get them until yesterday or haven't gotten them at all.  be mad that by conceding the election before all the ohio votes had been counted, Kerry basically gave out a big FUCK YOU to all the Ohio voters who waited in line to 1am and later to vote, thinking their votes actually MATTERED.  

DO NOT get mad at a person who just MIGHT be more well-informed on ""the issues"" than you are, has a basic knowledge of the political process and being fed up with the BULLSHIT that it is, has decided not to perpetuate bullshit, by voting for the candidate of his or her choice.  

obviously i'm angry, everyone has a right to be mad.  but point that shit in the right fucking direction.  Unless there really is a revolution of thought, no outside party candidate will EVER be the reason that a main party candidate doesn't win.  Cuz even with all the support Nader got from those who would traditionally be considered democrats in 2000, Gore STILL won the election.  Nader is not the reason that Gore was not our president in 2000, BUSH & Gore are.  Bush cuz he stole the election, and Gore cuz he did nothing about it.

i don't even think 3 million people voted for nader in TOTAL, so even if every single nader voter had been on the kerry side, it wouldn't have made a difference.  

yes i am upset about bush being our president & i have been getting stares at my home-made ""buck fush"" t-shirt all day.  but it's the system that enabled him this much success that pisses me off even more. choosing the leader of your COUNTRY for the next 4 years should NEVER come down to choosing ""the lesser of 2 evils"".  KERRY FUCKING LOST TO BUSH!  to BUSH!  HOW THE FUCK DO YOU LOSE AGAINST A FUCKING MORON?  At least Gore technically won.  Kerry did not, in any way.  What does that say about him?

Anybody But Bush was a flawed campaign from the beginning, because the mere fact that Bush is the president has proven how having ""ANYBODY"" in office is lethal.  why don't we the people get off our asses, and instead of just electing someone cuz we think he has a good chance of beating the guy we all hate, find someone who we actually LIKE as a candidate, who we actually believe can do some good for us all, individually and collectively?

politics involves the allocation and centralizing of power.  when we have elected officials, we hand over to them OUR power.  i think entirely too much of myself to just be giving that to ANYBODY but bush.  FUCK THAT.

we're all guilty, because none of us did shit in 2000, which was when all of this really mattered.  this whole shit is the failure of the american people, and not just the republicans."

"event","not too long ago some random white boy from Detroit (that i have never met, despite his claims) that attends university of illinois requested me as a friend on the facebook.  so i added him back because wtf not, it's the facebook.  however, i'm rarely of interest to midwestern white boys (or any white boys, really) so i went to his page to see who this guy was.  and saw that for <b>intended vote</b> it said bush.  so i sent him a succinct message ""are you really voting for bush?""

his reply was a relatively lengthy (though vague) explanation of his political conservatism. my interest was more than piqued.  anyway, since then we've had a friendly exchange of dialogue because i am so excited about having insight into his type of person.  i think the whole convo is interesting enough to post, but this is his latest comment which i find really interesting (it's an excerpt from the whole message)

"event","i was so happy today because of my refund check and getting a 98 and 90 on my 2 most recent quizes, turning in all my work on time (it's substandard, but i will worry about that later) and getting my refund check. WHAT BITCH! (lol)  then i talked to stophe and he is back on a breathing machine.  i was like <b>shit</b>.

i am TOO tired to go to work today :-/. but that is what i will do, because i don't want to get fired.  

me & derin had the bomb ass conversation last night (well, i thought so).  i see her more than anybody else (in life) i think...and we're both talkative and pensive people, so i take conversation for granted...but last night so many issues were covered.

mikey's journal mentioned the presidential election, and john (or somebody) asked me who i was voting for recently...i think i will probably decide in the booth, though i think i've already decided.  i don't mean to keep reiterating the same shit but 1) i see very little difference between kerry & bush.  and 2) i was just thinking to myself how the ABB thing is WRONG because the mere fact that Bush is in office has proven that just putting <b>anybody</b> in office can be deadly, and a whole bunch of other fucked up shit too. 3)i agree w/homegirl in blackfolk that just <i>voting</i> for someone and not following up on the shit is as bad as or worse than not voting at all, but voting IS a start, and i know that the people who died for the right to vote in the past and continue to die for political enfranchisement NOW are NOT putting their lives on the line so people can vote for the ""lesser of two evils.""  4)what would leave me to believe that Bush will not steal the election again (if he didn't <i>win</i>)?  There were no repercussions last time.
SOOOOOO i dunno, tuesday will tell :)

this Chinese girl (as in, Chinese citizen) was asking me what i would do if Bush won again...i was like ""i don't <i>even</i> fucking know.""

ohhh i am so glad this week is O-VER.  hopefully my plane won't crash on the way home (i always think about it) cuz i can't wait to go home!

i have been thinking about how much i miss my granny (and other older dead relatives in general) a lot lately.  my history of african american music class and the book <u>the spirituals and the blues</u> by james h. cone in particular have given me an entirely diff. perspective on African-American christianity.  I have a new respect and greater appreciation for it.  for reasons that i can't discuss cuz to do so would make me late for work and i will incurr the ire of megan, lol.

im watching the news and i don't understand why ppl keep talking about eminem & and michael jackson.  Who gives a fuck, and why?

despite my whole emotional intimacy problems/self-imposed isolation issues in the interest of self-preservation, i am once again, thankful for my loved ones.

alrighty! im out.

ok i neglected to mention how im tired as fuck for having slept a total of 9.5 hours since sunday night. so let me mention it now.  im tired as fuck.

i love my creole class. yesterday was so great, for no reason.  everybody was just chillin. professor was chillin.  cracking jokes but still paying attention to the work.  it was great, reminded me of the good parts of high school."

<b>Youo've stopped at a shrimp shack after 2 am (because it tastes the best at this time)</b> yesSAH

<b>You think that Lou's Deli (the Mc Nichols location) has the best corned beef sandwiches!</b> um, no i definitely liked the one in that ambigous detroit/oak park/southfield location down from the Perry drugstore behind Northland off 9 mile.

You demanded a ""feathered hairdo"" after 1985

You know what a coney is

Saginaw is ""Up North""

<b>You spent the day after Prom at Cedar Point</b> that is not just relevant to Flint.  Clearly that applies to Michigan, Ohio, and parts of Kentucky & Indiana.

"event","i write so many pseudo-poems.

today i started to slip into that state of blahness that always leads to depression.  it started innocently enough, reflecting on possible outcomes to a present mystery.  and as usual, any contemplation of my being with someone else resulted in rather unfounded* feelings of inadequacy.  and as usual, i combated my feelings with logic, but my heart was stuck on feeling shity. and just when it seemed i would spend hours engaged in heated debate with myself, greg called, and that was great. it had the feel of divine intervention in the sense that he called at exactly the right moment.  and we talked about his current relationship and issues he'd been having, and it made me fall in love with complexities of people, again.  i love how dynamic people are, how deeply and intensely we can feel, how we create ourselves and develop these sensitivities that are different from the next person's, and something that would set me off wouldn't necessarily mean shit to you.  the way i can hear a phrase and it arouses one sentiment or meaning in me, and you can get something totally different from the same phrase.  i think that's so great.

greg is cool. talking to him reminded me of the fact that my life is really in my hands and will be decided as i go.  

but i really can't see myself making that trip...not b/c of him or anything that might develop between us, but because i'm an indepent-minded person.  i don't know anybody at that school, in the city, or in the state...i'm uncomfortable with the fact that i would be completely dependent on him.  

but still, i think my fear of forming new emotionally intimate relationships is a problem that should probably be dealt with.  but i'm not sure how, at present.  i don't know <i>why</i> i maintain my overall ""distance"" from folk, but i continue to do it... *shrug*

i actually thoroughly enjoyed my dad & grandma being out here, and i look forward to going home on the 14th.

that whole senior year appreciation thing is getting to me.  lately i've been thinking about all the people i enjoy (on various levels) that i just never had time to build tight friendships with--mainly gabi, dawit, gabe, crystal diaz, but other ppl as well--and i was like gee that's too bad."

"event","the way most white people phrase this word really annoys me.  like, i hate saying it because i feel like i sound like the white people that say it.

i was watching carson daly's show.  bill maher was a guest.  carson said ""now let's talk about rap, i know you have strong opinions on rap."" i started itching.  then bill maher opened up his mouth, and i wanted to open up <i>my</i> mouth and wretch.  huhhh please don't go translating eazy e songs into ""white"" and think you're current, this muthafucka been dead almost as long as i've been alive.  more importantly, prostitution was not the invention of any ""rap"" artist, white girls have been selling their coochie for the equivalent of gucci probably since the first white man got dumped.  paris hilton's videotaped sexual escapade has nothing to do with rap.  i thought bill maher was renowned for being an intellect?

speaking of ""rap""...ma$e annoys the hell outta me.  derin has this mix that features his own song ""breathe stretch shake whatever"" and also on the remixes of ""lean back"" and ""jesus walks"".  i really just want him to shut the fuck up.  i honestly want him to never rap again.  that's serious coming from me.  the ""lean back"" remix annoys me, because why the fuck does it exist?  fat joe is still as wack on this one as he was in the original.  remy sounds like any chickenhead bitch off the street, but i kinda like her voice, so i guess she aight, cuz i certainly was not caught by any of the words.  ""we just pull out our gats and blow your block away""?  BIG FROWN.  Thumbs down, way way down.  And Em sold out just to be on some supposedly hype shit.  it's odd to accuse em of selling out, since that's what he's been doing since day one of his post-infinite career.  but still, even though ""my name is"" irked me the shit out of me, it still managed to convey some of his personality, or at least his projected persona of an annoying, sadistic, smart-aleck white boy with entirely too much mouth.  THIS shit...has Em ever been to the Bronx?  And then on TOP of that, the song is not hype. Why, Em, Why?

Speaking of ""why"", the original was kinda like ok...it reminded me of some of Nas' supposed ""consciousness""...but the remix, i was really feelin' that shit.  i was like wow...sorry if this seems condescending--actually, i'm not sorry.  i'm just noting that this may seem condescending--but do ""mainstream"" people even know who obama is?  well...he was on the cover of jet...but i mean besides saying ""that guy...he's black...he's a politician"" do people know who he is? how did this remix get to be mainstream?  i like it though.

remix of jesus walks is annoying, but i like common's verse of course.

""knuck if you buck"" and ""nolia clap"" pleased my ears too...i think i like angry shit cuz i just be in grumpy ass moods sometimes, and i need some shit to go in the background, cuz i really don't dance to it no more being that i've become something of a social recluse...and listening to emo alternative when i'm mad doesn't do it for me...listening to that shit inspires people to inflict pain on themselves and/or others in torturous ways.

i was reading the xanga of some dude karah showed me...who has fabricated the greatest life for himself.  this goes beyond being rich.  this fool claims he went to Morehouse, U of M, MSU, is coming back to MSU to do grad school.  Claims he invented some shit for GM and is getting paid...is simultaneously 20 and 21, went to Southfield Lathrup and Cass, where he was in FBI (freaky boys incorporated)...just a whole bunch of shit.  me, i was entertained karah wanted to catch him up in his web of lies, and i was like why?  there's no way the shit is true, let him live his fantasy life online.

speaking of FBI, i really think that's so funny that Detroit had & has dance troupes...right now FBI and the polo boys are the only ones i remember by name, probably cuz we had our own version of the polo boy hustle...but that is MAAAAAAAAD 80s for a group of dudes to be battlin on the dance floor...i just remember polo boys used to dance in thongs at Legends, St. Andrews, and the Rock and in my youth i found that shit semi-exciting, but now i fully recognize the homo-ness that it was."

"event","just yesterday i was complaining that i would have too few credits (14).  now i will have too many (18).  but i'm pretty excited about them all, except for creole class.  the professor is not serious.  she is always unprepared, she does not supplement our homework at all.  she let us out mad early today, because she didn't have anything to do.  i expected this to be my easy classes because i like language classes and i have somewhat of a foundation in creole.  but still, this is not serious at all.  it's so disappointing.

anyway, i have to choose a thesis topic.  i think just about everything is interesting (except for like, data systems), so that's difficult for me.  so everything is pretty broad right now.

yesterday i was thinking about feminism, how black women are still largely defined by black men, and how we allow ourselves to be defined by black men, and how this is not a reciprocal process.  very general.  i somehow wanted to tie this into young women though, and the power dynamic.  in 1981 bell hooks wrote that despite the fact that women were breadwinners in many households, this was looked down upon by men because so many women were housekeepers or did other tasks considered demeaning, that men would never do.  so the woman sacrificed her dignity, while the man (while not contributing to the household) was able to maintain his.  but now times have changed, and it's the brothas doin the ""demeaning"" jobs while black women are becoming more corporate (which is why i was confused by Ro's comment a lil while back). so i'm wondering why the male female dynamic is still pretty much the same, even though reality has changed.  also want to see what a black feminist revolution would look like in today's world, if it's needed, what it would mean, etc.

but that's very broad and the subject has been covered intensely so unless i can figure out what ""new"" aspect i want to bring to this topic, i will have to move on.

then i was thinking of the new hood novels, since they've become my new pet peeve.  it's not their existence that annoys me, it's the fact that people use the word ""enlightening"" to describe what they're doing when they read this books.  i guess like karah said, it's enlightening to those who've never experienced what's happened in the books.  so i'm thinking about this, and then what michael eric dyson was discussing last night, ""the voice.""  

oooh tangent.  Michael Eric Dyson was such a great speaker.  I'm SOOO glad I made the decision to be 20 minutes late to my discussion section in order to be able to hear him speak.  I'm sure some people would have issue w/his preachy style but i doubt he does that all the time, it seems like he intuitively sensed that the majority of the audience would enjoy him...and we sure did.  so his talk was about marvin gaye & 2pac.  He discussed 2pac first so because of time constraints, his analysis of marvin was rushed, but i guess i'll just have to buy his book.  a lot of the lyrics he quoted were from ""me against the world"" or earlier (there might have been 1 exception).  i'ma really have to read his book, because you could tell he didn't get to discuss anything as in depth as he would have liked. but basically, he said how pac ain't get his dues as a ""deep thinker"", how he talked about subsidizing your own oppression when he talked about getting harrassed by the same police whose salary you help pay, & how that's ""Marxism 101"", how all his many rhyming contemplations of heaven, God, death, destiny, duty were the same concepts & arguments proposed by Martin Luther and John Milton, and how the fact that he phrased things simply doesn't take away from the complexity of his thoughts.  i found it interesting.

when he talked about marvin gaye it was less analytical and more historical.  like he contextualized marvin & his music within the times that he lived.  talked about t. terrell and how there was a correlation btwn the brain tumor that caused her death and all the physical abuse she suffered.  and how distraught this caused marvin to be, but how marvin ended up abusing women too.  

so, i was 20 minutes late to my discussion section.  when i got in, i told my prof the reason for my tardiness and he asked me to talk about what dyson had said.  so when i was like ""it was a comparison of marvin gaye & tupac"",etc.  he was like ""now that's an interesting combination.  you have one guy who was extremely successful, and another one who died a violent death.""   and i TRIED not to look at him like a complete idiot when i said ""well, i would definitely say they were both extremely successful, and they both died violent deaths.""  he looked perplexed, this other girl in the class was like ""yeah, marvin gaye was killed by his father."" before i could say it. then the prof was like ""well, you know what i mean.""  UMMM NO MUTHAFUCKA I DON'T! 

then this muthafucka wants to test me on my knowledge of pac, asking me from whom his name was derived, and (by no means am i any expert on him, BUT) i was lookin like you messin w/the wrong one kid.  SO i ended up giving a good 8 minute mini-lecture, and then had to intro myself, and my professor's attempt at the great whiteman game of oneupmanship was a failure.

and i was annoyed because dude is originally from ann arbor.  so in my intro when i said i was from detroit, he asked me what high school i went to.  FOR THE RECORD i attended the Center for International Studies and Commerce at Martin Luther King Jr. Senior High School.  And he was like ""Detroit definitely didn't have anything like that while i was there.  But Detroit has changed a lot, in many ways, sense then."" it wasn't what he said, it was his tone that i found irksome.  HMMM what has changed?  The black ppl no longer live solely below Jefferson.  The city is now 83% black.  our current mayor is black, and the youngest mayor in america.  he went to cass tech, a PUBLIC high school and graduated from FAMU a, BLACK college, and he's mayor of a city in a state w/substantial politcal power.  

ok it's quite possible that the prof really didn't mean anything when he made the comment.  but his oldelitewhitemale ignorance had already annoyed me so i was just viewing him in that light.

today his lecture was about slavery...am i the only one who gets really annoyed and offended when African slaves are referred to as ""immigrants?""  i don't care what modifiers preceed the term, that shit is just not accurate.  ""forced immigration"" may not be an oxymoron, but it doesn't make sense.  immigrants are not ambushed, shackled, & stolen.  like, to immigrate to a country, you have to LEAVE the old one.  Isn't LEAVING an active verb?  If someone is making you leave, you are no longer leaving, you are being kidnapped.  that's like referring to rape as sex.  it's not intercourse, it's a violation.

in conclusion, i strongly think another term needs to be found for ""the forced immigration"" of Africans to America.  Call that shit enslavement and be done.  Huhhh this american history until the civil war class is about to make some old ""anti"" type feelings resurface

hmm back to my thesis.  so dyson discused ""the voice"" and the role it played in African Americans struggle for ""civil"" human rights, how black people have manipulated this voice to their benefit, the fact that ""the voice"" and literacy have in a sense been equated to humanity, how a lot of Cosby's upset totally nonrealistic rambling is partially at his anger at the ""wrong"" people ""having the mic"".    so that interested me.  in terms of the black hood novels that are oh so popular, i'm less interested in representation, and more interested in...hmm i dunno yet.

welp gotta go to the hsa mtg. peace."

"event","i have really been soooo chill.  right now part of it is the fact that i'm tired, because for some reason i cannot make myself go to bed at a decent enough hour to get at least 7.5 hours of sleep.

so apparently i'm not the only one who thinks bush will either win or ""win"" the election.  but i'm going to vote for kerry (instead of nader) anyway, i think.  even though i think that's some counterintuitive logic (if not completely illogical).  man...i don't know.  like honestly, as both Michael Moore on hot 97 and Eric Dyson last night pointed out, people died for the right to vote.  not that i ever need this fact to be pointed out to me, but honestly...did people die and bleed and risk their lives and leave their families behind just so i could vote for the <i>lesser of two evils</i>?

but from my parents' perspective, they ask if people died just so i could ""make a statement"", while unintentionally helping out someone as __insert all manner of expletives here__ as Bush is.  so i was starting to feel that as a registered voter in a hotly contested battleground state, it was my duty to vote for Kerry.  But as I just said, I think Bush will win anyway, and if he doesn't win, he could easily repeat 2000 and ""win"", so i might as well vote for wtf i want to vote for, hoping that if enough people vote for nader, the democrats may notice that everyone is not ""moderate"" and some of us on the left-hand side of moderate liberalism may be feeling just a bit left out.  but then i'm like maybe i've been watching Fox too much, and bush isn't destined for victory, so i need to manipulate the political system to accomplish interim goals (interim goal #1 no bush 2004).  

but then i was thinking about nick, who was saying he refuses to vote in the presidential election because of his pacifism and after he explained his motivations, i respected that so much.  i was like wow, someone who actually has convictions.  he doesn't want to vote for a candidate who supports war (may be a little naive, but that's what he's about, his major is peace & justice).  i'm like man, don't i believe in freedom?  do i really feel comfortable voting for a candidate who supported the patriot act?  i don't even trust kerry.  i don't think anyone would be as bad as bush, but i don't think kerry is gonna do a whole lot for me.  

huhh...moving along.

derin was talking about jude & his girlfriend danielle, and she was like ""they'll probably stay together for a long time, because she was the person that was there for him when his mom died.""  and i was thinking yeah.  

so...then i started thinking about how i feel that i went inside of myself a lot when my granny died.  maybe i'm being selfish and overlooking people but honestly, i don't really feel like i went to any people in particular for strength or support, or anything like that, other than my mom & monie.  which i don't even think is fair, because that was my mom's mom, and monie's granny too.  but i really feel like that changed all my relationships, really.  i realize these are the feelings of a petulant child, but i honestly do think i was really looking for like 1 person to just really come through for me & just be there for me and understand...and i didn't feel like that happened.  so i definitely feel more distant from just about everybody in my life that i'm not related to.  on the other hand, i feel closer to my mom, and some cousins.  

while i haven't actually been motivated to make ""new"" friends in at least 2-3 years, now i have even less.  i like the friends that i have, and i realize that i'll probably never have that ""perfect"" friend who will just be there at all the crucial times.  don't get me wrong, i did talk about how i felt to people, but probably like only 5% of it.  but...i don't know how to explain it.  this was not really something that i wanted to get through by myself, so to speak, and i feel like that's what i did.  i'm sure i unknowingly played a part (maybe the biggest part) in that, b/c derin & janina said i had grown distant.  but the person who was there all the time was my mom, but clearly i didn't feel comfortable talking to her b/c she was grieving too.  

the summer was fun.  i was really all about enjoying myself.  but now i'm all about getting the fuck out of barnard, so i feel like once again i'm retreating inside of myself.  i think that might be a good thing, because so far i'm saying super on top of all class work, and not out of that sense of dreaded obligations, but i'm actually excited about what i'm going to study (SO FAR).  After rearranging my schedule several times, i think i finally have it fixed.  i'm taking american history until the civil war, history of african-american music, intro to haitian creole, thesis class, and gender, health, & healing in Africa.  18 credits...so serious.  but it's because i'm changing my concentration from history to poli-sci at the last minute (i was done w/my poli sci requirements.  Next semester i can take it light, and actually be a part-time student.  but i know myself, so i won't be doing that.  i'm scared about letting my math req being postponed until the last semester, but at least that class and my thesis will be the only classes i HAVE to take.  then i want to take a spanish conversations class, and maybe a refresher course in french.  

& then i will have officially created my own ""language"" minor (not officially recognized of course, but best believe i will be tellin people i minored in language), with a year of mandarin, 2 years of spanish, a semester of creole, and a semester of french all under my belt at columbia.  or maybe i'll take something completely new like arabic or yoruba.  who knows.

so i'm practically in night school, because i do not have any classes before 2:10 pm.  That's on Mondays & Wednesdays.  On Tuesdays & thursdays, my earliest class is at 2:40, and i'm not done with classes until 7:45.  On Monday's, I have a discussion section from 8:10p-9pm.  

but this is pretty great for me, because i'm a morning person (in college terms), but i'm not a person who likes to be up & out in the morning, despite the fact that i wake up at 8:30 everyday. and i'm much more likely to do homework while it's light outside.  i just hope everything works out. i'm taking a heavy load though, creole will be the only ""easy"" class."

"event","Oryan is omarion's lil brother right? i kinda like this lil song. i wasn't listening to the words too much cuz he's not really enunciating, but the words i heard seemed simple and pop-ish.  

i really had the intention of writing an entry because i had shit i wanted to talk about.  but i'm so fuckin chill i just can't really think.

i woke up mad early cuz i had a dream...that my granny called me to tell me my dad had died or was dying of a heart attack.  and in my dream i was crying, more because of the fact that my granny had called, rather than my dad being dead or dying.  The voice was hers but I kept asking ""who is this?"" and she said ""Isis, this is your Granny (like she always said)"" and i was like ""no it's not.  foreal, who is this?"" went through that whole exchange a lot of times, every time i asked ""who is this?"" i got more & more upset and afraid. i kept saying ""no it's not, my granny's dead."" and then the voice got stern with me (not mean, but in the this is business type tone) like isis, does it sound like? and i was like ""granny..."" and she was like ""that's cuz that's who it is.  now i got something to tell you.  your dad is dead, honey.  he's in the hospital.  now it ain't no time for cryin, you gotta be strong for mama."" (it was weird cuz she said he was dead, but then in the dream  he was in the hospital, not dead yet).  but like i said, in my dream i was far more disturbed by the fact that my granny was calling me on the phone than the state of my dad's health, because it was so real. like, it overloaded my brain and that's what actually woke me up. i don't know why that disturbed me so much.  i had another dream in which she was speaking to me from the grave, and it was all good.  but for some reason, this one really had me shook.  i woke up with my heart racing, breathing hard, i was in a state of panic.  

so i called my mom & relayed the dream & the emotions in it aroused in me, and it was just eerie...like i ended up calling my mom at the EXACT same time she called me to tell me my granny had died.  and that was on a saturday, too.  my mom thought this had something to do with today being september 11th, but i really don't think so.

i mean clearly 9/11/01 has tremendously effected me.  the whole experience of it will always be meaningful for me.  but the actual DATE is just another day to me.  and even if that wasn't the case, there is no correlation between my dad and a potential heart attack, and september 11th, so i don't think that's it...

but yeah, i woke up this morning just feeling jarred and off. so i stayed up a few hours, watched c-span and went back to sleep.  this senator from new york (can't recall his name at the moment) had me CRACKING up when he was talking about how the war in Iraq has absolutely nothing to do w/ sept. 11th.  then i watched african videos on some local station.  the dancers made the most complicated dances ever look sooo simple.

ok i need to do something of use today."

"event","My mom called me this morning to informed me that my aint mat passed away last night.  it was expected, after last week's discovery that she had gangrene, but that was mighty soon.  like, i just saw her in july and she was fine.  i definitely think she was the victim of nursing home neglect, because never should her gangrene have advanced to the point of death within a week, and her having internal bleeding & throwing up without anyone noticing.  but i mean she was 100 and lived a full life, so...that's that.  i'm kinda sad but at least i feel ""prepared"".  so i'm going to try to go to her funeral/memorial service depending on when it is, and if airline tix are not too costly.  i hope somebody can convince johnny to wait til the weekend after this one to have the funeral, so we (detroit fam) can all go down to cleveland, but w/gangrene, sometimes you have to have the funeral asap.

so, when i went back to sleep after that call, then my dad called.  he keeps talking about my sister's new literally MILLION dollar house up in Beacon, NY like ""damn, that's a big ass house.""  I don't blame him for his shock.  a few years ago he was giving my (grown ass, married w/kids) sister a monthly allowance.  Things that make you go hmm...or, things that make you go damn those are some shady muthafuckas.

i finally re-bought <u>a right to be hostile</u> and since i had forgotten so many punchlines, i'm highly amused.  and i really love my van hunt cd that i received in the mail yesterday.  can you be in love with a song? if so, i'm in love with ""down here in hell (with you)"".  and throwback,i been listening to the love below again, as well as sweetback (sade's band).  

i'm so disappointed.  i have no right to blame anyone but myself. it's my fault for imposing my ideal onto a <i>human</i> (imperfect) being...won't make the mistake again though, that's certain.

Ok way for me to lose track of the whole fucking point of this entry.  <b>i really wanted to talk about how i think i'm gonna vote for ralph nader in this presidential election</b> after 1)talking to nick about why he's going to write in my name for u.s. president (lol), 2)seeing & hearing nader & others speak at this panel i went to last night and 3)remembering that i'm an idealist and how seriously i take the responsibility of voting.  to be succinct i'm just not a ""lesser of two evils"" person.  i would like to talk about some of the things discussed at last night's panel but actually typing about my aint mat's passing has me kinda bummed.

on a (trying to be) happier note, i may convince derin to come with me to fake the funk at msu.  me, derin, lauren, & karah would be fun times."

"event","it doesn't disgust me (well, sometimes it does), and i've been mildly entertained but...i don't get what's so great about it.  everybody i've asked has said it's for entertainment value, and that they don't sit at the screens with their hands down their pants jerking off...which i believe, cuz i've never gotten all hot & bothered watching cumshots.  sometimes the 5th grade humor in me finds it disturbingly amusing, but this is rare.  my friends will show me scenes like you gotta see this chick stick a bottle up her choch, or look at dude's kids on her face.  but im just sitting there straight faced like ok...is it the shock value? i don't understand the appeal of porn.  and i admit that the prudish side of me is sometimes very disgusted, but i just don't get it.  

but i never understood the appeal of cartoons either.  the only cartoons i used to really watch were david the gnome, and the l'il bits.  But my dad used to always watch Looney Tunes and Rocky & Bullwinkle and i used to pause and watch a few seconds while passing through the living room and just be like wow, this shit is inane, htf is your grown ass entertained by this.  and my mom is like the only person i know that feels me on this.  i can only shrug and assume that i must have been missing the point.

"event","i don't think we're gonna get married like he says, but i could see me & greg being cool for a good portion of our lives.  i was thinking about him today, and he called me.

i swear i'm like half psychic.  foreal.  i was talking to chassidy today, and she was talking about how ugly her shoes were.  just out of the blue, not relating to anything we had previously been talking about.  as soon as she said ""my shoes are so ugly"" a vision of janina's burgundy & tan shoes popped into my head.  so chassidy kept talking about her shoes being ugly (because she's like that) so i asked what color they were, and she said maroon & tan.  i mean, maybe that has more to do with what i consider to be ugly, but i think it means i'm psychic, lol.

so anyway, i talked to greg for a long ass time (like 3 hours) about randomness and reminiscing on presidential classroom. and i had a nice lil convo w/chassidy, talking about relationships, sex, and family. and i also talked to my mom, cuz we called each other (for various reasons) probably like 6 or 7 times today. or more.  so i feel less lonely.  which is good.  yayness.

and now, im just up watching the olympics."

"event","ok so yesterday the president of the ioc (or something) said that this whole best all-around male gymnastics controversy thing was done, sometimes judges just make mistakes, in good faith.  ""in sport you have to deal with human error.""

today the IOC and FIG (international gymnastics federation) send a letter to paul hamm asking him to give his medal to the korean dude, because that would be the ultimate show of good sportsmanship.

they rejected the request of south korea to award 2 gold medals.  they are still rejecting that request.

they started the korean dude too low, but they also neglected to take off .2 cuz of his fixed body position or whatever.

so i think they should just award duplicate medals and seriously be more careful in the future.

i need them to get their lives together and try to start making some sense, cuz this is some bullshit.  how can they ask hamm to surrender his medal? does he get a silver one instead? will they ask the silver medalist to give his to hamm and play musical chair with medals? this is ridiculous."

"event","<P>this is what i believe, and how i believe these beliefs came to me.&nbsp; please note, this is the longest entry of life.</P>

in answer to Ebony.
<P>the simple answer of how i came to believe what i believe is this: i have always been interested in the intangible world, and just knowing things, knowing everything. i took what i was taught &amp; what i was read, and i picked what i liked, and i discarded what i didn't like, and some things i've always believed and other things i have and will make up as i go along.</P>
<P>my mom &amp; granny would probably be considered ""liberal"" christians. i was raised up in the salvation army http://www.salvationarmy.org--yes it is based on community service and uplifting the poor and otherwise overlooked (drug addicted, elderly, crippled) but it is first and foremost an organization dedicated to spreading the word of God. The Salvation Army is unlike any other Christian denomination that I know of, and I have a great love and respect for the Sal.</P>
<P>Being raised up in the sal, i was taught many things. the rules of the salvation army are that no officer (legally recognized pastor) can preach at any corps (church) for more than 5 years, to emphasize the fact that a church is God's house, not any particular preacher's. this being the case, i was exposed to a variety of differing viewpoints on exactly what Christianity is/was. However, as a confirmed member, then adherent, then solider of the Sal, the basis of my beliefs was this:</P><B>
<P>We believe</B> that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were given by inspiration of God, and that they only constitute the Divine rule of Christian faith and practice. <BR><BR><B>We believe</B> that there is only one God, who is infinitely perfect, the Creator, Preserver, and Governor of all things, and who is the only proper object of religious worship. <BR><BR><B>We believe</B> that there are three persons in the Godhead - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, undivided in essence and co-equal in power and glory. <BR><BR><B>We believe</B> that in the person of Jesus Christ the Divine and human natures are united, so that He is truly and properly God and truly and properly man. </P><B>
<P>We believe</B> that our first parents were created in a state of innocency, but by their disobedience, they lost their purity and happiness, and that in consequence of their fall, all men have become sinners, totally depraved, and as such are justly exposed to the wrath of God. <BR><BR><B>We believe</B> that the Lord Jesus Christ has by His suffering and death made an atonement for the whole world so that whosoever will may be saved. <BR><BR><B>We believe</B> that repentance toward God, faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and regeneration by the Holy Spirit are necessary to salvation. <BR><BR><B>We believe</B> that we are justified by grace through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and that he that believeth hath the witness in himself. <BR><BR><B>We believe</B> that continuance in a state of salvation depends upon continued obedient faith in Christ. <BR><BR><B>We believe</B> that it is the privilege of all believers to be wholly sanctified, and that their whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <BR><BR><B>We believe</B> in the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the body, in the general judgement at the end of the world, in the eternal happiness of the righteous, and in the endless punishment of the wicked.</P>
<P>this is the dogma/doctrine of the salvation army, also called the 11 articles of war, which as a teen i had to memorize, in order to claim my rightful place in the Detroit Harding Corps as soldier from the Appling line. (My family has a history at my church). </P>
<P>if this seems to be veering off track, what can i say? i'm going into detail about the sal because the sal was my first introduction to what faith or God was, and was a huge part of my life from age 3-17, and also was heavily tied to my family. I was a sunbeam (equivalent to brownie or girl scout), girl guard (equivalent to girl scout, cadette), corps cadette (teen bible study), i sang in SAGAS (salvation army gospel arts school), did dance &amp; timbrels (tambourines) which included all-weekend rehearsals all over the metro area (flint, pontiac, farmington hills, port huron, ann arbor) i wrote plays for the Christmas performance, i went to Echo Grove (a campground owned by the sal) in the summer learned to play cornet in the band, went to corps cadet retreats in the fall &amp; winter. </P>
<P>and i loved it, but all the while the messages above were being absorbed into my psyche.</P>
<P>i went to a lutheran school for kindergarten. 4-8th grade i was at catholic school, episcopalian for 6th. catholicism was like a whole other world. unlike most Christian churches, the sal does not believe in communion (or baptism, for that matter). so i got to St. Bede Catholic school and i was like <i>wait a minute. you're <b>eating</b> the body of christ? and drinking his blood?! WTF?!?!</i> Catholic school taught me that this was holy. My parents told me this was heathenism. This whole comparing and contrasting thing continued throughout my years in parochial school, cuz i was a religious person. i've always had a foul mouth cuz i've been cursing since i was 7, but i mean other than that i was really trying to follow the straight and narrow. pre-marital sex? wrong. homosexuality? wrong (but not homosexuals). drinking? wrong. smoking? wrong. cursing? wrong. not going to church? wrong. gossipping? wrong. you know, etc.</P>
<P>So, then we had my dad, who was in the Nation of Islam during some part of his life. And he was really heavy on the whole judgment day thing, jesus was just a prophet not a deity, damn the wicked and so forth. </P>
<P>i mean i grew up watching the minister (minister louis farrakahn (sp?) formerly louis x) and the rev (reverend k.c. price). and then i went to catholic school, where the pope was like some intermediary between humankind and jesus.</P>
<P>and i would have to say that i think this conflict of ideas was instrumental in putting me in the position that i'm in now. at school im being taught the hierarchy of sins while at church i'm taught that all sin is the same and all can be overcome if you sincerely repent, and at home i'm not even really clear on what's a sin and what isn't. to my mom pre-marital sex is a sin. to my dad it's a sin there's all these STD's so people can't be free like they were back in the 60's &amp; 70's. so i've always been in the position of having to choose what made sense to me out of whatever ideas where being thrown at me at any given time.</P>
<P>so i've always had a lot of conflicting ideas on who exactly god is, or whatever. i also really loved Madeleine L'Engle's books. She's most famous for writing <U>A Wrinkle In Time</U>, but it was <U>A Swiftly Tilting Planet</U> that really got to me. She infused a lot of religion into her books children's books with grown-up messages. Her books were always about love. Just love. Do the right thing and love somebody. love unabashedly, love without being loved in return. In <U>A Wind In the Door</U> her point is that the collapse of a mitochondria (lil thing inside a cell) matters just as much as the collapse of a galaxy, that everyone and everybody is connected and that every action has a reaction, that even bacteria has its role to play in the destiny of the universe. I was in 4th grade when I read her books about the Murray family for the first time, and maybe i couldn't see or understand these concepts as clearly then as i do now, but i really liked those ideas, and they stuck with me. I internalized them. It made a lot more sense to me than, say, damning billions of souls to hell just because they don't necessarily buy this Christ business.</P>
<P>i also read a lot of LJ Smith books. She wrote about kids with ESP, witches, vampires, magic stuff that would be labeled the occult. and as a result, i became interested in all these things...palmistry, psychics, ouija boards, astrology, auras, wearing certain scents or colors for a specific purpose, keeping a certain stone close to my body for protection or strength.</P>
<P>i loved star wars, the whole idea that within all living creatures there is a force that can be harnessed and used for good but also for evil.</P>
<P>i studied buddhism and learned about a bodhisattva (sp?), a person whose soul is enlightened and lives in this world to help others and i was like hey, i strive to be that. i can't really tell you about buddha, but i remember that.</P>
<P>i studied islam and learned that the definition of a muslim is merely ""one who submits to the will of god"" and that the sun is muslim, because it rises and sets each day, as God has ordained, and i was like hey, i strive to do that.</P>
<P>i studied hinduism and learned about the 7 chakras, areas of specific energy concentrations on the body, and i was like whether this is meant for real or whether it's just a metaphor, this makes sense to me and i want to cleanse my chakras, i do believe my mind has control over my body.</P>
<P>i learned about confucius, taoism (the way), and feng shui and i was like all of this makes sense to me. it makes sense to me that if my environment is in disarray, my psyche will be in disarray as well. it makes sense to me that that which matters in this world is that we cannot see, hear, smell, or taste. i believe in polarity (yin &amp; yang), that everything has a negative and a positive side.</P>
<P>i had always questioned christianity, but it got to a point where there was just too much that just didn't make sense. the bible, the virgin birth story (just because i'd heard that one before, in other mythologies), the overt paganism infused into both catholicism and protestantism, the way christianity went through all these transformations just to try to convert more ppl, etc. and i was like this just isn't for me, plus i never really understood the whole trinity but still monotheistic thing. i could deal with jesus being god and man. i could not grasp jesus being God and also being God's ONLY son and also not being God. And where exactly did the holy spirit fit into this whole thing? </P>
<P>so then i came really close to converting to islam, but i wasn't feeling the whole submission to men thing. so then it was about the baha'i but they believe that certain people on the planet have been manifestations of god (buddha, MLK, Krishna, Jesus, Muhammed, etc.) and i went back to the Madeline L'Engle books where mitochondria and galaxies hold equal weight and i was like hey, why do Jesus and Muhammed get special status? weren't we all created in God's image (whatever that means)? no one is favored in God's sight, right?</P>
<P>and then i got to college and i was like...hmm women being the cause of original sin and the downfall of man? sounds like sexism to me. and i just kind of shed a whole lot of Christian beliefs.</P>
<P>I was anti-religion for awihle, but no longer. I think religion is great for those who follow it. I love talking to Iffat about Islam because she's so enthused about it, and you can see that she really loves Islam. I love watching my mom (and loved watching my granny) be such good examples of what Christians are supposed to be, same respect to Sean P. But religion (at least not any i've studied) is not for me. I don't think it's necessary in my life to connect me to God. I don't think it's necessary for anyone, but some people feel that it is necessary to their lives, rendering it necessary so...i dunno, figure that one out.

in any case.  i would like to know about heaven or hell or what happens to our souls when we die, but i don't, i know what's here now.  so my frame of reference is what i know at the present. i know that people are starving now.  maybe it's true that once they get to heaven they'll never be hungry again, but right now people are starving and there's no need for that.  
</P>
<P>anyway.</P>
<P>Of the 11 articles of faith that i had to memorize, only one has stuck. I believe there is God. One God, who is the creator of all life, who is perfect, the embodiment of all that is good, all that is true, and all that is peace. I don't believe there is a man (or woman) in the sky, sitting on a throne in a mansion made of pearls on a street of gold. i think of God as a light force, postive energy. To me the existence of God is something that I would never question, I don't understand how one <i>would</i> question it. To me, it's like questioning the existence of air. Air is not something to believe in or not believe in. It's there. You can't escape it. You need it to survive. To me it's like when did air (not oxygen, but just air, matter in the form of gas) come into existence, who knows the answer to that? is it even answerable?</P>
<P>I see all kinds of things as proof of God. The fact that no two fingerprints or snowflakes have exactly the same pattern (so they say), the fact that each person actually has a number of hair strands/follicles on his/her head, the fact that billions of years ago there was just volcanic matter on this planet, and now there are ants and people and grass, not to mention this computer that i'm typing on.</P>
<P>i believe that there is good and there is evil, and you pick one. and most people kinda lean more to one side than the other. and i think most people lean towards the ""good"" side. i believe that people are basically good but that they, in general, are foremost motivated by an instinct for survival, and problems arise when we have flawed visions of what is needed for our survival.</P>
<P>i believe that each person is a unique soul, and that my me-ness is manifested in everything that is associated with me. the year of my birth, the date of my birth, the fact that in chaldean numerology i'm a ""1"", the fact that my sun is in aries, my ascendant is in cancer, my moon is in aquarius, and my venus is in pisces (etc.), the fact that i have an ""M"" good fortune on my hands and chains crossing my heart &amp; life lines, the fact that i'm african-american, a female, that i have curly naps or nappy curls depending on the day, or any other thing. i think my soul is imprinted on me.</P>
<P>in palmistry there is an active hand, and a passive hand. not counting ambidextrious folks, the active hand is the one you use more. the passive hand supposedly indicates the fate with which you were born, and the active hand represents the destiny that you are in the process of creating for yourself.</P>
<P>i think life is a balance of those things over which you have no control, and the making choices out of the opportunities that present themselves to you, or creating your own choices when there appear to be none.</P>
<P>Back to God, I believe God resides in each living thing, and i believe anything alive has a soul. I look at simple things, like you take a man and a woman and then they have sex, and then, instead of 1+1=2, 1+1=3, 4 if they're twins, 5 if they're triplets, etc. How is that not miraculous? A seedling rides a breeze, finds its way to the ground, add some sun &amp; some rain, and then you have a future tree. How is that not a miracle? How is that not God?  I even see death as a miracle.  Take a human.  A human being can live to be a 101 years old.  Then that human being dies, and in a matter of hours rigor mortis sets in, then in a few days the body begins to decompose.  but for 101 years it was on point. </P>
<P>I think science is a tool, and that science and religion/mythology can go hand in hand. i think everything is meant to come together. again, i believe that there is good, and that there is evil. yin &amp; yang. science has black holes &amp; white holes, matter &amp; anti-matter. According to Celtic mythology (i think i got this right) energy was once formless, and kinda just hanging around then the great/holy fire collided with great/holy ice and from this life was created. that's similar enough to the big bang theory for me.</P>
<P>for this reason, i don't<I> necessarily </I>see conflict as a negative thing, i see this as the grounds for creation, the creation at times having the potential of being greater than what has created it. when hot air &amp; cold air meet you get a clap of thunder, a sound wave hits something and you get a sound, sperm &amp; egg meet, you get life, etc. not trying to glorify evil, i don't think that there has to be evil to be good. i guess what i am saying is that even if everything was literally all good, there would still be conflict. i'm on the tip of you need sun &amp; rain to get the grass to grow, you get the idea right?</P><FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=2></FONT>"

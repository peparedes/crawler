"event","on Sunday, ryan and i went to the movies to c once upon a time in mexico. he paid for our tickets and then i willingly paid for his drink and my nachos. Half way during the movie, ryan made a move and held my hand and then massaged my arm with his other hand. It was really romantic. Then we drove to pho van and i ordered him this pho and a drink and we split it. Alot of people stared at us. THen this relaly homophobic guy thanh from marshall sat near us with his girl. HE is such a fucken asshole. he started saying faggot and all this shietz and then they kept looking at us. I had a great time though."

"event","""gerid"" cant spell his name so ill stick with using gerid. he was shocked about what happened in hewitt's class when i sat on girl's side. so after skool, larry goes up to me and starts laughin and gettin embarressed. betty was there. so larry says gerid said sumthin and was too afraid to tell me. so this went on for a couple minutes where larry was about to tell me what gerid said but didnt. then hes like ""gerid said u finally totally came out"". me and betty was lookin at eachother crackin up. so I told him y gerid looked at me weird when i sat on girls side and larry jsut took it at that. STill doesnt realize what gerid said was tru even though i did ""bout a year ago"" not one day in history class. So yea, betty and i were just having a bawl laughin.

I went to GEN X, there was this fine mixed guy, coundt discern his ethnicity, but he kept eyeing me the whole time. i would be lookin at clothes and look at him and c him starin striaght back at me. it was soo unusual. so we walked back and forth constantly eyeing eachother. i could have gone for him except he dint make a move and he was checkin me out, not me to him, so i was like, his loss he was too chicken, i still got other guys to choose from."

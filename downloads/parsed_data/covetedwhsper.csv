"event","i'm so tired of being tired....i may officially be entering sleep deprivation mode. some of it is my fault...like last night when i was just having too much fun not doing studio work in studio and didn't start on the assignment until 2am....work is getting in the way a bit. i think its only because i'm letting it but it really does make the whole day a bit more inconvenient. tuesday is over and done with though which is good b/c it is the worst.....7hrs sitting at this blasted desk, doing NOTHING (relative to the things i could be doing......sleep, studio shite...etc.)hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so i just realized i can't remember if i've posted about this blah blah blah stuff already. oh well.

so i've, as of yesterday, got a blog up on my website.......oooooooo lawd, lets not talk about how ugly it is...it knows. we are re-doing the ones we made last semester and they taught us the wrong way back then so we're all back at square one. they taught us the easy/cheating way so now when asked to do it with html and such instead of just slicing up photoshop crap, its pretty darn difficult. i think its going to be the hardest thing and most frustrating out of our projects....but most gratifying i think when its all said and done and working. i have these really big ideas of fun stuff to do but i don't have the technical knowledge and tony just wants us to step back and not even think about that now.....but even though its still going to be a portfolio site somewhere in the folds....i'm really excited to make little fun things and put them in just because i wanna....the old site we all pretty much made it strictly our portfolio and this time we get to play.
www4.ncsu.edu/~scbroome (oh lookie....i don't know how to insert a link)
i hesitated to include that now but i figured no one reads my shite on here anyway (and when i say no one, i mean more than the 3 that i know of).........so know it is bad...it will be bad. it is only a zygote right now b/c it is really easy to set it aside since its an on-going project without official ""due dates"" i want to make it pretty i do really, but i just don't know how to do that with the software yet."

i form really strong bonds and attachments to people really easily and quickly when i like them....whether with platonic intentions or not. to simply state it, i am very generous with the people that i care about...i will walk on hot coals without being asked to...
i think this is one of my good traits but the down side of it is that i find myself constantly in a gray area.....i can tell if i like my friends or if i LIKE my friends but it doesn't cause problems really aside from tiny bits of insignificant jealousy.....
well lately there has been a lot of talk around me about forevers and soulmates and such so i began to think about that.....when shannon asked me if i believed in soulmates my answer was that its a nice idea but i don't think its something i'll find....i said its like santa claus.....i've known since i was about 6 that there is no santa...but i still leave out milk and cookies just in case. 
so somehow i tied the two thoughts together and became sad b/c i solidified my thoughts that soulmates don't exist b/c i can't see myself only feeling that way about one person or feeling so much stronger about only one person forever.....so i began to cry, not b/c i think i'll be alone b/c i know i'll be surrounded by loved ones, but b/c i suddenly felt the ultimate loneliness that i will never find true love.........

"event","i can't sleep.....probally only b/c i need to be.
so i go through these phases where i decide i'm going to keep a journal (surprise, this time it's electronic)and i write in it steadily for about a week...then it dwindles down to once every other week...etc...until it only gets picked up under extreme circumstances. well i don't know what made me decide to it up and thumb through but i did....and i didn't read anything except for the very last entry. it was so surreal....there is this page bleeding with this blue ink all over it....illegible even to me. its just such an odd feeling to look back at that page because it was created in intense pain and emotional distress and now that its been something like a year....to remember that time, i can remember when i was writing it, to be put back in that time now when i'm so seperated from it and am in some way or another a different person is just so strange. that pain is still in me but time has worked its healing magic......surreal...it was just very very surreal (and good to remember)"

"event","i haven't kissed enough people in my lifetime.....i decided this the other night. i spent the entire evening thinking about it on wed, the day yesterday not thinking about it, and then tonight remembering that i had thought about it. we were out on the porch like we so often are, just chatting -shannon, ashely, and myself- and it just basically turned into this whole i'm alone session. shannon was telling all of these stories and i began thinking you know, i am not doing any of these sorts of things and here she was talking about it and how she misses it at times and i won't have anything to be missing........and yadda yadda yadda and i began to feel like i haven't been kissed in years and would never be kissed again. there was such an urgency and damn near despiration.....
out of hand
anyway its all better now even though i am still smoochless

ugh, i've got to get up at 6. 6 o'fucking clock!!!"

"event","earlier today our power went out...hell if i know why but b/c it was just too damn quiet and boring mom and i went out to target and a movie. i'm a big dork b/c of it but i'm really excited about the toys i got a target today. i got a set of jacks and a set of 4 die that all light up when you throw them. so yeah, anyway we saw down with love........eh, cute and entertaining. went home pretty much to drop mom off and then i caught up with travis. i realized tonight that i'm his hag and it was a very cute momment....i've been a fag hag wannabe for awhile and now i'm someone's hag...yay
first we went to the white rabbit just b/c then headed over to caribou for some coffee. when we got there my friend from high school, karah, was there and ended up that kathryn was on her way then to meet her there.....so it was an evening with several of my favorite people. i hadn't seen karah in over a year and i forgot how much i like her. something about her is just delightful.....i think its her eyes. anyway...it was really good to see her again and i'm glad that we decided to go there tonight b/c she's headed back to boston tomorrow. there was a lot of discussion of zodiacs and astrology and such tonight..i kind of felt left out of the discussion b/c i know the characteristics of my sign and that i'm pretty darn close to being a model cancer so i didn't have any questions or needed cancers to be explained to me......so it ended up sort of this lets talk about everyone else and how they match their sign and such and i just sat there. 

i feel dead spiritually yet there isn't anything i think i can do about it. i'm not spiritually active b/c i haven't found anything that really calls to me and makes me want to get all involved without feeling fake. i don't have anything that i'm just really passionate about (that goes for everything else too). well i guess thats about all i can say about that whole storm in my brain without getting all theological and stuff and that would just be annoying myself so i'm not going to go into it....."

"event","last night i ended up going to a play called stop kiss that my darling kathryn was stage managing.....i'm very glad i called her b/c i was probably going to end up staying home again and i miss her terribly. i saw her maybe three times last summer when the one before that i saw her practically every damn day. i may be getting up with her later but i dunno.....
anyway, after the play i went over to shannon's and ended up just sitting on the porch talking to katie until 2:30 about any and everything.

today i ended up going to see the matrix b/c shannon, katie, ashely, and tim were going but i'm a broke ass so i wasn't going with them......but ashely got called into work and gave me her ticket. it was good but not great
-too long to me.....i think a lot of it was unnecessary but maybe i just was too restless in the first place. my attention span was gone before the movie ever started...

went and talked to the guy at michaels in matthews and i have a job but i just may not be working a whole lot for the next few weeks. he said he'd give me a call to let me know where they can fit me into the schedule....mentioned possibly cross-training me to where i can work at the frame counter too.

man, i felt like i had so much to say when i sat down to make the entry but i'm getting more and more tired......and i've managed to mention the major parts just without all the little things.....eh who cares."

"event","have you ever been so out of control of a situation that you have no clue what's going on, how it started, or what the hell will fix it? i honestly don't know what the fuck just happened. shannon called and was all like what's wrong with you...why are you not talking to me.....you've been weird all week and its hurting my feelings. and i just don't get it. nothing is wrong.....i don't know what i'm doing wrong so that it is coming across so badly and it seems impossible to change my tone of voice or anything. when i've talked to her there is has honestly not been anything wrong, i just don't have anything to say. she went and took that wrong and said well i guess we shouldn't talk if you have absolutely nothing to say to me.......and all of this is just sort of shocking me numb to where i am no where closer to having anything to say. it makes me feel scolded and i feel bad that some how i'm hurting her feelings when there is nothing tangable or direct that should be doing so. it definately isn't personal......i'm just in a quiet sort of state (probabally from being by myself more frequently) and it almost feels physically impossible for me to move my mouth to speak even if i did have something to say.
i feel like i just watched the expensive vase get pushed off the table and tumble to the floor right in front of me.....when i could have caught it but for some reason i was paralyzed and couldn't move my arms to even try.
i just can't make anything make sense in my brain."

ok, so i'm learning that i'm going to have to make myself stop on this b/c i will just keep talking and talking to myself forever.......but i don't expect anyone to read it anyway so i guess it doesn't matter."

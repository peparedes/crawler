He thinks he's really good at this one video game, but, he has no idea how bad he's going to loose. I guess I should take it easy on him. But of course I won't. I hope he's still my friend after he stays here a whole week of savage losses."

"event","keeeyaaaahhhh!   yea so i finnially got my ass back to silent dragon, all thanks to nick. the best birthday present EVER! it was exsactly what i needed.  it felt sooo good to be back. feels soo stupid to have left. but hey im there now, and for the loung haul, ::gasp:: untill i leae for la. hopeflly steve can recomend something in la. well see. but well get there when we get there. 

as for la. i talked to the school again, and got the exsact requirments for my portfolio. and im about 33% done. and am striveing for it to be all done by the end of the month. althought ill neer be satisfied with it.  but i just need something good enogh to get me IN to the school, i keep trying to put this omega thing together, that i want to blow them away with. so thats the plan with that.

work sucks. im too pretty for work. but at least its not a job that i have to care about. or even try at. so thats good. that equalls all energy to kung-fu and portfolio.  i told em my sceduale for southern was my kung fu schedual. so i wot be missing any classes. and i told them no more than 20-25 hrs a week so i can work on my port. 

my next plan is to get rid of my internet so i can focus more time into those to things. (ill be able to update from erks and check my other online fixes from there. so yeah BAM! UPDATE!"

Nick,
 the kid never lets the other kid have a chance. allways keeping his head down and shirt over it. thats good. who knows the other kid could possibly have beat'n the crap outa him, but he just doest let him. hes not nessasarily wining either. just not letting the other kid get at him, untill he has a chance to inflict the game over shot. then it doesnt matter whos a better a fighter.    kinda like what we were talkin about."

"event","Went to go see my first comedy show this weekend, at the casino. I always wanted to go to one. It was a good exspearince, although i don't remeber the spacifics. I was a lil drunk, we all were (erk and Eric). The guy had to make Jesus jokes. ....... A i hate that for obvious reasons. You don;t make fun of the only Omnipotent super powerfull creator. period. it just doesnt seem like a good idea to make fun of God, when he can wink you out in a second, or worse. Espesicaly when hes also the most loving being to exsist. I decided to walk out, and pee for that part of the show. B i think whe comedians go there, its almost a lack of talent, like Jesus jokes for the shock factor. LAME. ( i hate when i end up hearing them, I hate it even more when i laugh. ( i always promtly ask for forgiveness in my head/lil prayer to him right after if i do. Other than that is was great and so much fun. I managed to spend more money than i wanted too. so boo. 

I saw War of the worlds, wich with an small exseption of a plot hole was good. (actually, 2, the first a small one involeving an EMP (electro magnetic pulse - wich nocks out all electrical devices, and they had a camcorder workig after it) the second, wich was in the book ad a pretty big whole with the whole plot, is a super inteligent race decides to go to another planet but doesnt look for microbiology? l a m e . (DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE MOVIE ""SIGNS""!!!)   we meer humans thought of it in our fledgeling space days. even more to the point we make sure WE dont contamate other worlds ourselves , let alone worry about becomeig contamanated. (did ja know were steralize everything we send up to other planets, we wouldnt want to find life on mars, that we brought there our selves...) but the movie was good and shared only aliens fucking up earth to only die of a cold; with the book. wich are allways better.

well tommarow, or when i wake up will be monday, time to get some serious shit done. i screwed of this week big time. im still constantly thinkig about school and CA / LA. id like to hit up some auditions while im out there, only for shits in giggles, ( i think of it as playing the lotto, no pipe dreams here) lol, getting there for school is enofgh in the first place. I think bout cars more. i guess i never really relised just how passonite i am about them. i dont have anyone to really talk about with them... i need to join a corvette club or something. maybe theyll let me washe them or something, (hump when there not looking) lol.  but ya gotta get in gear and stay focused. i got my mental list of shit to do tommarow. so i gotta get it done. if i seme like im beig redundent i am, im tryig to say it to myself as much as possible, so ill do it. sorry for draggin you guys along for the ride of montany."

"event","Well it has come to my attention that i havent wrote anything for awhile...um mainly because i dont get online too much. And i figured i would make an update or two. 



Well did u know that the only food that will not spoil is honey, yea no kidding. got that fact off of a snaple lid. oh another one is bees use the sun to navigate thats kool.
um enough about that well today i was soposed to wake up at like 8:45 to do some chores so i could go over to matts house and meet moe and katie around 11:00 so we could attempt to play a song or two. Well i did wake up at 8:45 but ya know aww i just want 5 more minuets well ya know how that is~2 1/2 hours later i finaly wake up. i get all my stuff done and i meet moe at my house and i try to get him away from my acoustic guitar that i just got(i had to pry it from him.)hey if anybodys reading i think we should get moe a acoustic guitar for his b~day in sept. so we eventualy get to matts house and there we actualy play some songs and make up new ones i was so suprised!!!!! we actualy acomplished somthing. 


around 3 we ate pizza and watched southpark-man it was such a hailarious episode when um they were all anime characters with weapons from japan and stuff, the song was soo funny. um after me and moe continued to play while matt and katie did their thing (just if  dont know matt and katie are together).speaking of relationships i want to ask anybody reading this if u think highschool relationships are worthwile? man, Moe is realy good at the drums i think he should be a drummer. Anyways me and moe made up some kool musical tunes. 


 Oh im going to work at the L.A. philharmonics center, im going to be an usher i think....or a bartender...naw just kidding that would be kool though. yea my dad has his second job there and he's hooking me up. Anyways so thats about all um......yea ok se ya"

"event","Hello Everybody um well i am camping right now im up north and its snowing!!!  well i rode my motorcycle and it was freezing. i did not fall but we couldn't go up narrow hills or cliffs because the snow and rain. i remember when i was in like 4th or 5th gear full throttle and the snow would just hit my eyes and it stung my face but other than that it was fun. oh im sitting here typing and when i breathe out it makes the mist stuff its cold like 38 deg. um well turns out that when my dad moved up here the owners of the house had a dog and they abandoned it so now my dad has a pet the dog's name is Duke, he is like sharpe or somthing but only half anyways so its real fun up here but it gets boring sometimes. oh and the drive up here was soooooooooo loonnnngggggggg. first i flew for about a hour then i got off the plane and drove 5 hours through a canyon with my grandpa ahhhhhhhh!!!!! its been like snowing for like two days after the 25th....well thats about all i want to say right now um if i think of anything else i want to right and it's not so cold when im typing i will....i hope everyone had a good Xmas and im missing you

Fatal accident:

February 03, 2002

A woman in her late teens or early 20s was killed early Saturday in a car accident at the Thornton Avenue on-ramp to Interstate 880. 

California Highway Patrol officers were unable to describe the nature of the accident, except that there was no other cars involved, and the woman, whose identity has not been released, was ejected from the 1998 Toyota Camry she was driving. She died at the scene. 

Police responded to the accident around 2:40 a.m., and the on-ramp was closed until 6:50 a.m."

"event","Picture this: You and me
Walking down a white sand beach
We're holding hands the warm winds blow
We're all alone

All these dreams are fantasies
They're not real, not reality
And now I cry over you
Nearly die over you
And all the bits and pieces of us
That I try to find

Are only paintings in my mind
Faded memories of another place and time
We were happy as can be
You were loving me
And now it's just an image that I find
Like the paintings in my mind

When you left I fell apart
I was torn, you broke my heart
And now I cry over you
Nearly die over you
And all the bits and pieces of us
That I try to find

Impressions of the way it was
Long ago, somewhere back in time"

"event","Have you ever wondered which hurts the most; saying 
something and wishing you had not or saying nothing and 
wishing you had? I guess the most important things are 
the hardest things to say. Don't be afraid to tell 
someone you love them. If you do, they might break 
your heart,  but if you don't, you might break 
theirs.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because 
you were so afraid of losing what you already had with 
that person?Your heart decides whom it likes and 
whom it doesn't. You can't tell your heart what to do. 
It does it on its own, when you least suspect it, 
or even when you don't want it to. 
Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything 
you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you? 
Too many of us stay walled because we are too 
afraid to care too much, for fear that the other 
person does not care as much, or at all."

"event","Maybe the time has gone, the faces, I recall. But things in this life
change very slowly, if they ever change at all...The scary part being that
we've all been hit with change lately, and it doesn't seem to have come
slowly at all. Do you remember the day you left home? I'm sure that you do.
But I'll bet that what you remember even more clearly were the days in the
week before you left. You know...the days that you spent getting addresses,
phone numbers, and email addresses and trying to figure out how to say
good-bye to everyone that you've loved as long as you can remember. Do you
remember standing by your best friend's car one night, after midnight,
trying to sum up the meaning of a friendship you'd managed to maintain
through thick and thin for years? Do you remember how hard that was, to
think of how to say good-bye to that one person? It was nearly impossible,
wasn't it, to give them that one last hug and turn around and walk inside?
I'll bet part of what you remember was the night before you left, kissing your boyfriend or girlfriend good-bye one last time. Just knowing that you'd have to turn around and walk
back inside was almost motivation enough not to leave. Stepping back to take
one last look at that person you love -- it's really scary. And you go and
you tell yourself that you won't ever find someone new. You won't ever
replace your old friends. You'll never fall in love again. It's really
crazy, what kinds of things can happen when you don't mean for them to. You
get to a new place full of strangers. You meet people who forget you. You
forget people you meet. But sometimes, you come across some extraordinarily
special people. They have tears to shed, too. They also left people they
love behind. They're still in love with that guy or girl from back home
where they used to live, and all want someone to talk to. So you talk. Talk
is good. You form bonds you never thought you'd form. You call your old
friends and tell them about the new ones. Sometimes, they don't understand. Sometimes, you hurt their feelings. Sometimes everyone is a bit jealous. You miss your boyfriend. Or your girlfriend. One day you're sitting in the park, thinking about all the
stuff you didn't want to leave, and a stranger sits down near you. Sometimes
that person stays a stranger. Other times you talk to him or her. Sometimes
you experience things that you didn't want to ever happen. You become
interested in a person that isn't your boyfriend or girlfriend at home.
Sometimes college is really complicated. Sometimes you stay together, other
times you break up. Sometimes you think you've done the wrong thing by
coming so far away from home. And sometimes when you start thinking about
this, it's time to make a change. So when this happens, you sit down and
turn on your stereo, and that song ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" from the
Armageddon soundtrack is on, or the Eagles' ""Sad Cafe"" song, and you wonder
if you can still recall the faces from your past. So, you pick up the telephone and you call them, all just to say ""Hi, I love you, I'm thinking about you."" And then just as an
afterthought you say, ""You know, I'm really learning a lot from college. I
wish you would visit all of my friends. They would love you. And you would
love them. They're very important to me."" Because after all, this is
college. And college is a growing experience. Growing experiences cause
change, and it's hard. But whatever doesn't kill you only makes you
stronger. So call your parents. Call your siblings. Call your best friend.
Or your girlfriend or boyfriend. Or even your ex, if that's how it worked
out. Tell them hello. Tell them that you miss and love them. And then, turn
off your stereo, walk out of your dorm room. Go to a new friend's room and
give them a big hug and say, ""Thanks so much for being here. I love you.""
You learn a lot when you go to college. You learn that pulling an
all-nighter means staying up all night to study for a test you will then sleep through. You learn that you can roll out of bed 10 minutes before class and go to class looking like
crap- and no one will notice or care. You learn you really can do things
for yourself without your parents looking over your shoulder -- but you also
learn you never realized how nice it was to have them there, just in case.
More than anything, however, you learn how much your friends really mean to
you. College friends come to mean a lot to you, but they can never compare
with your friends from home. Your friends from home teach you the meaning of
friendship during your college years. Because you are apart from them you
tend to express your feelings more - you learn how much these people truly
affect your life. You've got your best friend who exemplifies friendship -
he or she calls at least once a week, sends email every day, and even sends
you real mail. You feel like you never left each other...he or she knows everything about you, and even over the Internet can tell when something is wrong. He or she
teaches you that distance doesn't have to change a friendship at all. Then
there is your other best friend. He or she rarely calls or writes and never
does the email thing. At times you think he or she has forgotten about
you...until you hear from them. You hear from him or her for the first time
in almost two months - and nothing has changed. You are still you and he or
she is still him or her -- even though you never talk, you are still as
close as ever; you are still the best of friends. You find yourself
expressing to him or her how much they mean to you -- because you realize it
now more than ever. They teach you that true friends are friends in the
soul...separation can't tear them apart. Then there are those friends you
sort of lost touch with those last few months of high school and during the
summer. You were busy, they were busy...but somehow, the magic of email has brought you closer together than you ever were in four years at the same school. You share secrets, heartache and joy...it's another person who cares about you as long
as you care about them too. Away from the pettiness of high school, you've
finally formed an adult relationship...and you realize just how great a
friend this person is. Suddenly, the people you thought for sure you would
lose touch with in college are the ones you keep in closest contact with --
and you miss them more than you ever thought possible. Sadly enough, there
are also the friends that you were closest to in high school who drift too
far for you to hold on to. You've both changed and suddenly you don't have
much to say to each other. But these people teach you a lesson too. They
make you value the others, the ones you have stayed close to, that much
more. These distant friends, though you miss them when you rarely think of
them, show you who your forever friends really are - and they make you appreciate those forever friends much more than before. College is rough. College severs some bonds and solidifies others...it puts a distance between you and the ones you
love. But it teaches you so much. It forces your real friends to come to the front, while the rest take the places in the shadows of your memories. In college, you lose
some people - but through real friendship and the strength of the soul
(which is where real friends join as one) you keep the ones you will need
most in your life. You learn the real meaning of the quote: ""If you press me
to say why we are friends, I can say no more than she was she (or he was he)
and I was I."" The people who fit that mold are your forever friends. Send
this on to the ones you keep in touch with. And send it to the ones you
don't - just to tell them how much you appreciate all they did for you. And
send it to your new college friends, who hopefully will be your Forever
Friends."

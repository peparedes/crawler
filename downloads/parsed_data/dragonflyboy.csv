"event","Last October <a href=""http://google.com/search?q=author+%22Neal+Stephenson%22"">Neal Stephenson</a> came to Google Kirkland to give a talk.  11 months later, I passed on one of his recommended books to a friend who <em>loved</em> it.  That was the kick in the ass that I needed to edit &amp; post my notes from that session...

<p>Poor Neal was at the end of a long book tour, flattened and sick enough that he couldn't project his voice, so we found him a working microphone, and he very graciously answered our questions for an hour, and signed some books, too.

<p>Q: Other authors or books that you recommend.

<ul>
<li>David Foster Wallace: 
  <a href=""http://google.com/search?q=%22David+Foster+Wallace%22+%22Infinite+Jest%22"">Infinite Jest</a>
<li>Dennis Lehane (known for Mystic River, and Gone Baby Gone):
    <a href=""http://google.com/search?q=%22a+a%22+%22The+Given+Day%22"">The Given Day</a>
<li>Gordon Dahlquist
    <a href=""http://google.com/search?q=%22Gordon+Dahlquist%22+%22The+Glass+Books+of+the+Dream+Eaters%22"">The Glass Books of the Dream Eaters</a>

<li>Matt Ruff: 
  <a href=""http://google.com/search?q=%22Matt+Ruff%22+%22Bad+Monkeys%22"">Bad Monkeys</a>, 
  <a href=""http://google.com/search?q=%22Matt+Ruff%22+%22Set+this+House+in+Order%22"">Set this House in Order</a>, 
  <a href=""http://google.com/search?q=%22Matt+Ruff%22+%22Sewer%2C+Gas+%26+Electric%22+%22Public+Works+Trilogy%22"">Sewer, Gas & Electric: The Public Works Trilogy</a>
</ul>

<p>Q: Have you read <a href=""http://google.com/search?q=%22The+Book+of+the+New+Sun%22"">The Book of the New Sun</a>?

<p>""No, but I've got that question
enough on this book tour that it looks like I'll have to.""

<p>""Monks are compelling to Sci-Fi people for the concept of a learned enclave
existing behind walls from the rest of society.""

<p>Mention of <a href=""http://google.com/search?q=%22A+Canticle+for+Leibowitz%22"">A Canticle for Leibowitz</a>...

<p>""Now we see the parallel where there is a bookish minority that is bifurcated
from the main of culture.""

<p>He recalled seeing two squirming toddlers one the same plane with their
respective parents. One mother reading to her child and the other holding out
a portable DVD player showing some toddler drivel, with the tinny speakers
turned up loud enough to be heard over the jet roar.  It was not hard to
discern which parent he (and indeed the entire audience) identified with.

<p>""On the book tour, spending too much time in airport waiting lounges, I've
taken to spiral searching out from a starting point, searching for somewhere
that the overhead TV ""news"" [emphasis NS] was *least* audible.  Almost
without fail, that place contained a cluster of readers.""

<p>""These days it takes discipline to be a reader.  A couple of hundred years ago
it was easy to be a reader, it could be your only escape.  Nowadays, without
discipline, you could end up never leaving your computer.

<p>Q: about whether Anathem, contained any value judgements about
monasticism?

<p>""It's not for me to be prescriptive, I'm more of a  descriptive type""

<p>""The other day on the news the two lead stories were #1 a train wreck caused
by the conductor who didn't see the signal because he was text messaging on
his phone.  And #2 the economic collapse in the US.  The shared theme of
terrible things happening because of our pathologically short attention
spans.""

<p>""But geeks on the internet are finding new ways to promulgate and distribute
knowledge.  Functions that 100 years ago would be carried out in academic
institutions.""  This a source of hope for him ""despite the terrible signal to
noise ratio"".

<p>Q: about the Long Now Foundation.

<p>""They are up to a good thing.  I feel in my gut that it is as important as
other things that charities focus on.  The tricky part is translating that
focus into actions""

<p>Q: In Cryptonomicon your description of traveling in the Philippines was
vivid and amusing.  Was that drawn from your travel there when writing an
article for Wired on undersea cables?

<p>""That was partly made up, partly highly exaggerated and extrapolated.  I was
stuck behind a pig truck in the Philippines, and that makes a strong
impression.""

<p>Q: on e-books

<p>""I have no say over the e-book publication of my books.  That all goes
through through agent and publisher.  Am not really a pro or con activist.
I've been using an e-book reader for several hours a day when traveling on
this book tour, but am also a big fan of books.  I'm not particularly worried
about the trees.""

<p>Q: on similarity of e-books & e-music

<p>""An album == two songs plus back-fill.  Customers have been dying for the
ability to buy just those two.""

<p>Talking about the publishing industry...

<p>""An unknown & pitfall of ebooks is
bookstores. [on book tour] going around to the bookstores, and meeting great
people [connecting with people and ideas]. I hope they can adapt to ebooks.""

<p>""It's interesting that publishing was thriving before copyright. ""

<p>""Publishers [do more than print books] maintenance of a social network of
writers, agents, readers, booksellers.  And if they do it well sales result.
There is value here regardless of whether the stories are on paper or
electrons."""

"event","OK, I'll admit I, <a href=""http://klimtomaniac.livejournal.com/714642.html"">said it</a>, but the rest of the sentence was: 
<blockquote>'...instead of 2 x 23"" LCD displays (turned on their sides) - which seems to be the standard here in engineering.'</blockquote>Granted there is an element here of ""<i>whining about the color of my Ferrari</i>"", but bear with me for a minute...

<p>Here's how I figure it:<ul>
  <li>1 x 30""(2560x1600) = 4.1 M pixels
  <li>2 x 23""(1920x1200) = 4.6 M pixels  ~~ 2400x1920
</ul>
taller screen == more line of code visible at once (~142 lines vs ~118)

<p>And people say ""that's a *crazy* amount of screen space"".  No not really, when you consider all the stuff to fill it up: <ul>
  <li>several running applications
  <li>debugger(s)
  <li>code editors
  <li>technical documentation (more than just javadoc)
  <li>cpu monitors (task manager)
  <li>log output windows
  <li>...
  <li>Nevermind the piles of other daily crap (mail, calendar, useless toolbars, etc.)
</ul>

<p>Your brain is truly incredible at processing visual input.  Consider everything that you have to see in order to drive a car to the grocery store.  Now try cramming all of that into one small screen, and tell me how effectively you can perform that ""everyday"" task!

<p>Yes, Virtual {Window Managers, Desktops} are wonderful things, and I rely on them extensively, but more screen space == higher bandwidth from computer to your brain.  

<p>While in theory on 30"" on it's side would be best for coding, in practice when you sit that on a desk, you have to crick your neck up to see the top (chiropractors would love that ;-).  

<p>While I wait to have my neural implant / cyberjack installed, what I really want is a screen like the one seen in SUN's <a href=""http://www.asktog.com/starfire/"">STARFIRE (a vision of future computing)</a> video.  300+ DPI, 2.5' x 3.5' PLUS the top surface of the desk!"

"event","Since Steve Jobs' ""One more thing"" announcement at the WWDC that Apple has <a href=""http://www.apple.com/safari/"">ported their Safari web browser to Windows</a>, there have been some strange reactions.

<p/>So let's clear up some things and draw some reasonable (not pie-in the sky) conclusions...

<ul>
<li>No, Apple does not really care about browser market share. (despite what the official statements say)
<br/>Yes, I know that they make a few million a year from Partners like Google and Yahoo via the searches done through the cute rounded-corner search-box (as does the Mozilla foundation from Firefox).  But this is small potatoes compared to what they make from Mac hardware, software, and iTunes.  

<li>The iPhone will run a slimmed-down version of Mac OS X.

<li>The iPhone will run the <em>full</em> version of Apple's Safari 3.0 web browser.  This includes JavaScript and full support for AJAX applications.  

<li>The core of Safari is their WebKit library which is based on the open source KDE project's KHTML and KJS libraries.  These have been staples of Linux browsers like Konqueror and Safari(on Mac OS X) for years, but until now they haven't been used in any mainstream windows browser.

<li>The iPhone must run ""Web 2.0"" and AJAX web applications that business and pro-sumer users require (like BaseCamp and SalesForce).  If it does not, the phone will be relegated to the status of ""consumer toy"".  
</ul>

<p><font size=""+1""><b>So</b></font>, Apple needs Safari on Windows to ensure that legions of Windows web application developers and testers can easily see their AJAX apps running on the same platform as they will run on the iPhone (without shelling out $500 for an iPhone;-)

<p/><br/>&nbsp;<br/>

<p/>The other bizarre-o claim floating around is that since Apple has now ""obviously"" ported the Cocoa application framework (and Objective-C runtime library) to Windows (for iTunes + Safari) -- it's only a matter of time before all the rest of the Apple flagship apps (iPhoto, Garage Band, Aperture, Final Cut Pro, Soundtrack, Motion, Shake, etc.) to Windows.  
<ul>
<li>Nope. Those apps depend on dozens more Mac OS X -specific libraries and services that are not present on Windows, and would be non-trivial to port:  Core Image, Quartz, PDF services, Core Audio, Spotlight, Metadata services, etc.

<li>Even if Apple did port their crown jewels to run under Windows, they would be undermining their OS and hardware sales.  

<li>Maintaining Windows apps would require expending a huge ongoing effort to stay current with Microsoft APIs that they don't control, and Microsoft is constantly updating (for example look at the history of DDE, OLE, COM, DCOM, COM+, ActiveX, .NET Remoting, ...).

<li>Plus it would piss off Microsoft, who only have to stop work on Office for OS X to deal a real blow to Apple.  
</ul>

<p><br>Lets face it, (the Steve Jobs version of) Apple wants to see the world:
<ul>
<li> running their apps
<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; (and buying their content)
<li> on their OS

"event","<tt>Re: Apple's WWDC announcement that future Macs will use Intel CPUs</tt>

<p>It's *JUST* a CPU!
<br>It's the software, that really matters!  

<p>As I write this I prepare to be excoriated by the large number of Mac and PC
geeks alike who obsess about CPU architechtural minutia.  (Don't get me
wrong, I love an in depth hardware analysys piece more than most, in
fact Hannibal's articles at arstechnica.com are some of the best) 
<br>But
back to my rant:

<p>I can see how, looking from the Wintel camp, it could be easy to mistake a CPU for
a platform.  For decades ""PC-Compatible"" has implicitly meant
""intel-x86-compatible"". Similarly, on the software / OS side, ""Windows"" has
also implicitly meant ""Windows on x86"".  (the port of Windows NT to
Digital's Alpha chips was never much more than a joke)

<p>But in the world of UNIX portability of apps, and OSes too, is second nature.
Solaris, IRIX, HP-UX all run on various CPUs.  Lest we forget Linux, which
run on more than a dozen different architectures.  And recall that Mac OS X
really is BSD UNIX on Mach (via it's NeXTStep heritage) - just another
portable unix. So when Steve Jobs showed Mac OS X running on Intel, the
unix-heads were not shocked.

<p>But the OS is 1/2 the story, the applications and the libraries that they
are build upon are every bit as portable.  (Have C compiler, will travel)
The Gnome desktop and applications that are running on the Solaris box in the
server room at work are the same code that runs on the Linux desktop, and
even here on my Mac OS X box (under X11).

<p>And it's <em>software</em> that matters.  The reason why people use
computers is for what the software enables them to accomplish.  Yes I know
that without the sweat of those busy little gnomes at Intel, Sun, IBM,
Freescale (nee Motorola), and others we wouldn't have the screamingly fast
hardware that Moore's ""Law"" brings us compounded year-over-year.  <b>But</b>
without interesting software, all we would have is screaminly fast
adding machines - much less intersting than, say, Doom3, Photoshop, Eclipse,
Apache, etc.

<p>The OS is portable, the apps are portable, and the lickable GUI that Apple
wraps it all in is not only portable but includes infrastructure support (a
decade old) for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary"">fat
binaries</a> that run natively on any number of CPUs, as easy as flipping an
option in your ide (or cross-compiling from the command-line).  

<p>And yet still there are hysterical crys about the ""soul"" of the Mac. As if
that somehow depended on the CPU.  Bullshit. It's software, pure and simple:
OS+Apps.  

<p>And for the Luddites out there who are resolutely clinging to their
cruftly old ""Classic"" mode apps from Mac OS 9 and earlier that run under Mac
OS X only via the BlueBox emulator, I say: joint the 21st century
already, there are much improved native replacements for the crufty 
old software that your are clinging to.

<p>...but if you Luddites are still paying attention, listen closely and
I'll tell you a not-so-secret...
<br><em>Even that most ancient of Mac software will continue to run on the new
Intel hardware.</em>

<p>It's true.  Not that Apple will announce this publicly, but trust me,
Microsoft isn't the only company on the block that knows a thing or 2 about
backward compatibility...

<br>...Already running on the prototype Intel-based Macs is mixed-mode emulator
and hardware-virtualiztion tool called ""Rosetta"" that runs current PowerPC
binaries at close to native speed.

<br>...And the BlueBox (the Mac OS X app that runs to emulate Mac OS 9), is just
another PowerPC app that will run just fine on Intel under Rosetta.  

<p>So a couple of years from now when I get a hankering for some retro game
action I'll still be able to fire up Strategic Conquest Plus 2.0 (the very best
of Mac gaming, circa 1989 ;-).

<p>Granted It will be running in the 68K emulator [1] that is part of
""Classic"" mode running on the BlueBox emulator [2], which in will be running
on the Rosetta emulator [3] mapping from PowerPC instructions to Intel.

<p>""Wow, that's [[3]] levels of emulation, performance will suck.""  

<br>Um, no, ironically hardware virtualization, and dynamicaly recompiled interpreters (like Rosetta, Xen, XPlex, VMware, HP's Dynamo, etc) 
- preforms even better when running tightly focused applications like
emulators. Plus we've got Moore's ""Law"" on our side, chips will be faster,
caches will be bigger, resulting in performance as good as it is today, if
not better.

"event","I've loved the UNIX-ness aspect of Mac OS X since the day it was first available to mere mortals (as opposed to developers who pay exorbitant anual subscription fee$).

<p>Just open a command-shell, and there's all your favourite command-line unix infrasturcture <tt>bash</tt>, <tt>perl</tt>, <tt>find</tt>, <tt>grep</tt>, <tt>xargs</tt>, etc.
And if your favourite tool wasn't one of the zillion shipped with apple's install CD, then it was almost always as easy (<a href=""#note1"">1</a>) to utter the standard UNIX install incantation: <blockquote><pre>$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install</pre></blockquote>

<p>Last week I was hand-updating some perl modules including the perl's web client chainsaw LWP: <blockquote><pre>perl -MCPAN -e shell &lt; echo install Bundle::LWP</pre></blockquote>

<p>Everything hummed along famously up-to and including one of the final steps: <blockquote><pre>Would you like to install links to the LWP request command line tools
(GET, POST, HEAD, etc.) in /usr/bin?  [y/N] &gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Without pause, I hit Y because command-line tools for web requests have enabled some powerful tools and wicked hacks for me in the past.  

<p>And all appears to be sunshine and light until a couple of days later the configure step of building a random open-source tool fails.  20 minutes of detective work in the plumbing of <tt>autoconf</tt> later I realized that somehow <tt>head -n 1 fileA &gt; fileB</tt> is the line that is failing.  Mystified, I wonder for a minute how this most basic of command-line tools could be failing.  

<p>Then the light-bulb goes on. I realise that the filesystem of my Mac OS X install is HFS+ (case-preserving but not *case-sensitive*).  Perl's LWP install was only too happy to create <tt>/usr/bin/HEAD</tt> and overwrite <tt>/usr/bin/head</tt>.  <br>*smacks forehead*

<p>5 minutes later I'd renamed the offending perl script, and restored the original /usr/bin/head from the Tiger install DVD.  Easy to fix once I figured out what I'd done, but it was notable as the first time I can recall that my wicked UNIX box wasn't!

<blockquote><font size=""-1"">
Of course if had installed 10.4 (Tiger) fresh instead of upgrading my existing installation of 10.3.x (upgraded from 10.2.x, ...) this wouldn't have been an issue, as the default filesystem is now case-sensitive HFS+ (or even UFS)

"event","In the tradition of great computer science debates <a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/C/considered-harmful.html"">past</a>, I considered using
the title ""YAGNI considered harmful"", but relented.

<p>It isn't the didactic sentiment that I disagree with: 
<br><a href=""http://xp.c2.com/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html"">YAGNI</a> - ""You Aren't Gonna Need It"" is the <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming"">Extreme Programming</a> practice that says: Always implement things when you <i>actually</i> need them, never when you just <i>foresee</i> that you need them.

<p>...But the practical task of trying to explain the truth of YAGNI to less experience developers.

<p>Let's face it the days of the lone hacker producing great works is past.  
Programming is a social activity that requires buy-in and co-operation from team 
members.  

<br>Ideally coding is an <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EgolessProgramming"">egoless</a> activity, where feedback and constructive criticism is valued.  Far too often the truth is quite the oposite: we feel a strong sense of ownership of ""our"" code because it is our very own creation of truth and purity forged by pure will from out of the chaos. 

<p>So, when you try to tell someone that they can avoid needless complexity of 
the feature they are about to implement because ""YAGNI"", they tend to react 
defensively:  
<br> - ""How dare he imply that I don't understand the requirements of the application?""
<br> - ""But I'm secretly eager to play with cool new technology <i>X</i>.
<br> - ""Bloody superior know-it-all.""
<br> - ""Can you predict the future?""
<br> - etc.

<p>Instead, I believe that we need to impart the wisdom in a way that indicates that you are on the same team, trying to get to the same goal.
<br><u>""We Don't Need It Yet""</u> (WDNIY) expresses the same concept of YAGNI, but in 
a less antagonistic way:<ul> 
<li>non-confrontational (inclusive ""We"", not the superior ""You"")
<li>not absolute (""Don't Need It Yet"" instead of the false confidence of ""Aren't Gonnna Need It"" ...<i>ever</i> seems to be implied)
</ul>

<p>Sometimes after several iterations ""Yet"" never comes, and the application is completed without the added complexity of whatever ""It"" was.

<p>Equally often, development eventually reaches the point where ""It"" really <i>is</i> needed in order for work to continue.  Fine, implement it.  But notice that in the time between when ""It"" first occured to you and now, the rest of the app has solidified more,  providing a better understanding of how ""It"" needs to be done in order to be done correctly.  Less chance of having to go back and revisit the implementation of ""It"" to allow for forces that were unanticipated at the time ""It"" was first foreseen.

"event","Wow, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/todiefordesigns"">Sid</a>
&amp; <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/exquisiteoath/"">Crispen</a>'s
wedding was really great.  The two of them shone through in all of the
details, from the ceremony through the rececption. I'm really glad that we
could make the trip to ""the 'shwa"" and back.  

<p>Most of you already know
how talented Sid is, but let me tell you that if you didn't see the dress
she made for their day, then ""you ain't seen nothin'""!

<p>Sigh, so terribly disappointed... I got to spend Sat. nite in a 
<s>cheap</s> motel room with only two women instead of the planned-for three
<tt>;-)</tt>.  (Hope NH's trip back to TO was uneventful)
<p>
<lj user=""jooolz""> snores - don't believe her protestations to the
contrary!

<p>I'll post some pics after the batteries for the digital camera are
recharged.  Using the flash so much killed 2 complete sets of 4xAA in just
a few hours.
<p>Now for the really lousy part: I found out that the auto-focus on our
(relatively) new digital camer takes long enough to lock-in that someone
walking towards you will cause it to never get sync and take the picture!
<br>Of course for a wedding this means both the precession and the
recession were a complete for me as camera-guy.  Next time I'll know to
use manual focus mode w/ a fixed depth of field - but that requires
forethought to measure out the distance to the ""focus spot"" from where I
stand, then patiently waiting for the procession-ees to advance into the
shot.

<p>Also sadly the batteries were completely when the perfect shot of Monica and B. presented itself.  Damn!  More on that at another occasion.

<p>Thanks also to <lj user=""innoxia_""> for the all-hallows fellowship.  The blue looks awsome after 5 hours w/ ManicPanic in foil!"

"event","...but ""God"" doesn't really give a crap if you, live, die, or how you do 
either.

<p>Um, Let me step back and start over...

<p><lj user=""sloot""> posted:
<blockquote><i>
  This man is smart...<p>
  <a href=""http://www.onomatopoeia.org/index.php?type=day&item=2003-07-30"">matt's blog</a>
</i></blockquote>

...link to a great post.  That piece, and the fact that several people
have been asking <lj user=""klimtomaniac""> lately about what I
""believe"", and possibly the fact that I've been listening to
Disturbed's ""Believe"" LP alot lately, prompted me to expound in a
similar vein to matt...

<p><i>Meta data</i>: This started off as a reply to <lj user=""sloot"">'s post,
but grew long enough that I wanted it to reside in my own journal for
reasons of information archeaology.

<hr size=""3"" align=""center"" width=""50%"">

<p>Despite my long-time cynical railings about various religious artifacts 
(""people things"" to use matt's terms), I do have <em>faith</em>.
<br>...but not in any organized religion sort of way.

<p>I believe that the universe is far too cool a place to have happened
entirely by chance.

<p>If the strength of the any of the fundamental physical forces
(gravitation, eleromagnetic, strong &amp; weak nuclear) were different by a
thousandth of a percent, then the universe as we know it (full of plentiful
Hydrogen and Carbon, with matter that has nicely-clumping properties for the
formation of stars, planets, oceans, etc.) would not exist.  

<br>Instead, the result of the Big Bang might have been a small hot soup of
plasma, or slowly dispersing cloud of sub-atomic matter that would never form
anything so interesting as a single atom, or a trillion other combinations of
values that would not have yielded a universe capable of forming stars and
planets, much less conditions under which self-organizing patterns (life)
could exist.


<p>This leads me to believe in a <a>creator, who
<ol>
<li>Set up the rules of the game
  <br>(picked values for the fundamental force constants, etc. 
       (which our primitive understanding has yet to see
        the unifying principles of))
<li>Threw the dice (big bang)
<li>then <em>Walked Away</em>
</ol>

&lt;snip&gt;
<lj-cut text=""Read more of D's rant on faith..."">

<p>He doesn't hang around to listen to the petulant whining of the
insignificant insects that populate just one of the zillions of interesting
rocks in his universe.

<p>
As a side note to CoCoPuff (in follow-up to an all-nite discussion that we 
had over a decade ago):  I still believe that even if the Big Bang that 
started our universe was the result of a previous ""Big Crunch"", there still had 
to be a ""first time"" big bang. (insert hand of creator there)

<p>
Divine intervention, and miracles?  Crap!  You make your own luck.  I see a
strong correlation between success and striving.  Anyone sitting and waiting
for their ship to come in is not likely to be ""lucky"".  But, in a universe
ruled by quantum as well as Newtonian forces, there is plenty of chance to go
around (to occasionally assist the lazy or penalize the hard-working).

<P>
Note that I say ""he"" out of habit left over from early childhood
brain-washing.  The entire notion of sex for a creator is ludicrous.


<br>
<p>
<br>

<i>Every <b>religion</b> that I've studied</i> (whether via
enforced-brain-washing, or by voluntary investigation), starts out
interesting, containing some insights and/or views unique to the founding
cultures / events.  But then the more I learn about how these core
<em>faiths</em> evolved into organized <em>religions</em> the less I respect
them.  For example...

<p><b>Buddhism</b> - starts with a couple of great principles
<ul>
  <li>Illusory nature of the world

    <br>A great coping strategy to allow you to maintain calmness and sanity
    in the face of the crap that life frequently throws at you

  <li>if your are nice enough though enough re-incarnations you get to get
  off the wheel of life

    <br>Something for the faithful to shoot for, and a reason to live the
    way the should be anyway.
</ul>

But by a few centuries after the time of the Buddha, it became an 
organized religion like most others, adopting of any number of bodhisattva 
figures to replace / assimilate minor deities and demi-gods of any local 
cultures as a way of easing adoption, and accumulated enough ritual and 
ceremony that these meta-faith artifacts (""people things"" not the faith 
itself) led to the Mahayana - Hinayana(Therevada) schism.  And don't even 
get me started on the weirdness of the ""diamond path"" sect.

<p><b>Christianity</b> - Christ was a nice guy, it's too bad that he was
nailed to a tree for saying that we should all be nice to each other.  (tip
of the hat Douglas Adams)

<p>
But from there somehow it turned into cathedrals, ceremonies in dead
languages, pogroms, speaking in tongues, lying down with serpents, original
sin, the KKK, resettlements, trying to out-breed the infidels, etc.

<p>My favorite Christian nonsensical article of ""faith"" is that the world
was created 4000-odd years ago.  Some nitwit (with papal authority and a
scratch pad no doubt) read the bible from Genesis forward, calculating how
much time had passed since ""Let there be light"".

<font size=""-2"">

  <p>That one has blistered my brain especially lately at my new job, where
  the very brilliant and self-taught VP of engineering has a box of books in
  the corner of his office w/ a ""Take One!"" sign; the title:
  _Refuting_Evolution_ (2nd edition).

  <p>I think he got the hint to back the fuck off when I left the recent
  Scientific American special issue on _Evolution_ on my desk for a couple of
  weeks.

</font>

<p>...Sorry. Where was I?  Oh, yeah...


<p>I mean really, what the fuck is wrong with people who lead religions? 
Is it some kind of PR competition, where the zaniest, most ornate, or most
out-of-touch wins?

<p>I try to avoid giving to charities that have religious affiliations, because
I find religious imperialism every bit as distasteful as the cultural,
political, and economic forms of <a href=""http://www.boondocksnet.com/ai/"">imperialism</a>.

<p>The last (and most personally insulting) issue that I have against organized
religion, is that someone else is telling me what to believe. I'm a
(somewhat) intelligent life form, and I like to think that I am capable of
choosing, not just between dogmas, but to believe what I will.

<p>I simply don't understand how the faithful (whatever their personal faith
is) allow clerics to interpose themselves between us and ""God""(s).  
<br>(in this vein I liked the movie Stigmata (which was not supposed to be a
horror movie - a misconception that led to most reviews missing the point))


<p>As a parting thought, I leave you with the words of Conan (the Barbarian)
<font size=""-2"">(Which just happens to be on City TV as I finish writing this,
and is oddly appropriate)</font>

<blockquote>

  ""Crom, I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one,
  not even you, will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought, and
  why we died. All that matters is that today, two stood against many. Valor
  pleases you, so grant me this one request. Grant me revenge! And if you do
  not listen, the HELL with you!""

<p><i>Meta data</i>: I'm sure that by not disabling comments I'm leaving
myself open various reprisals, most of which I can predict.

<br>My (as yet limited) understanding of LJ culture would seem to indicate
that disabling comments is most often a cowardly act adopted when taking an
indefensible position.

<br>...So I guess I'll do like (my) god, leaving you the free will to

"event","Friday I finally got the cheque for the work I did in *April*.

<p>Hurray, I left work early at 3 to bus back home in the rain, pick up
<a href=""http://livejournal.com/users/klimtomaniac"">wife</a>, 
jump in the car and race off to the bank to the TD bank that issued the
cheque to get it certified. ($8 fee that will save the 3~6 day hold when I
deposit at my own bank).  <b>But</b>, after waiting in line and starting the
process the smug TD teller tells me that the fee is now $15, and I don't have
that much cash, so I go across the lobby to find that their bank machine is
going to charge me an extra $1.50, fuck, whatever, ok.  So he goes back to
the back room for another 5 min, only to emerge and tell me that the cheque
cannot be cashed because the MetaSoft finance peon left out the hundreds when
filling out the written amount.  Double fuck.  Back across town to the
office, and manage to intercept the finance veepee on his way out the
door. After my polite explanation he takes the cheque inserts a ""^"" and
""<i>n</i> hundred"", and hands it back picking up his briefcase again.  I have
to explain to him that the bank is not likely to take his correction,
(nevermind that his harsh black scrawl does not match his assistants's loopy
blue original).  After some hemming and hawing a new check is written out and
K &amp; I are off
across town again through increasingly wretched rush hour traffic to our own
bank.  (Fuck the $15 certifiction - that's way more than the best case
interest that I could earn in the hold period).  As I wait at our bank, I
relate the tale to the teller, who apparently took pity on me, because when
he handed me the reciept, he said ""no hold"". Thanks man.

<p>The moral?  Get the teller on your side (sad story helps!), I think they
have more leeway than the regulations would indicate.


<p>Celebrating <lj user=""sloot"">'s birthday with the Wenches and associated
others was a great way to leave all the cheque frustation behind!

<p>The cheque itself was annoying, but I can't really blame MetaSoft [<a
href=""#metasoft"">*</a>], for the 2.5-month delay. They, in-turn, have been
left dangling by MegaDeath [<a href=""#megadeath"">*</a>], working on several
small 3-month demo contracts while waiting for the signing of the 3+ year
contract for the ""real"" contract to build and deliver the real product.

<p>There is a series of bureaucratic bungles and processes to explain the
delay by MegaDeath, but with my own contract to MetaSoft up for renewal at
the end of August, this kind of thing makes me pretty nervous.

<p>This contracting thing ain't necessarily all it's cracked up to be.

<p>Failing any more <a
href=""http://www.trond.com/brazil/images/brazil18.jpg"">Brazil</a>-ish
beurocratic bungles, the check for *May* should arrive this friday.

<p>If it does, I get to finally replace my old mac with a spanking new <a href=""http://www.apple.com/powermac/"">G5</a>!

<p>We also get to afford to fix the catalytic converter on the car,
<br>I think it's pissed at me for biking to work so much lately!

read &lt;wife&gt;<lj user=""klimtomaniac"">&lt;/wife&gt;'s friends-only posts.

<p>Not knowing the netiquette of LJ yet, bear with me and lend me the benefit of the doubt for a while as I lurk &amp; post only sporadically.

<p>In fact I may well go off into technical diatribes of the exceedingly strange async io polling mechanisms available in <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/macosx/index.html"">Panther</a> or the paucity of Java Collections framework compared to the C++ STL.

<p>When a very close friend of Angi's (tip of the hat to <lj user=""nighthawk21"">) heard of the shredding of my ACL ligament on the ultimate field, she apparently got a mental picture of me flying heroically thru the air, before tragedy.  
<br>(the truth had far more to do with the brand new cleats, and an attempted sharp left turn)

<p>...so in her LJ she began to refer to K's consort as ""flyboy""

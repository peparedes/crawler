As for my knee,&nbsp; I got it bent to 105 degrees and walked with only one crutch.&nbsp; The dyke pushed me harder than the cutie pie so I guess that she is probably the better therapist for me.&nbsp; They removed the last of my staples.

I respond to ""I don't care drugs"" like I did to free liquor in college.&nbsp; Yes, apparently I had quite a good time while they were operating on me. AND just like college I have to rely on other people to tell me about it.<br />2. I am indeed a mean determined bitch.&nbsp; I can already bear a good deal of weight and can bend to 77 degrees. AND I haven't&nbsp;needed a pain pill since surgery day.( thus reinforcing my belief that I have some super-human pain tolerance.)<br />3. The anestetist says that I have sleep apnea.<br />4. My other ACL is torn worst than the one that I just had fixed. Also reinforcing my belief that I have some super-human pain tolerance because it doesn't hurt at all.<br /><br /><br />So I don't really have any gruesome details.&nbsp; I remember nothing. Spent one night in the hospital.&nbsp; Got a groin to ankle brace.&nbsp; Was called an over-achiever by the PT.(guess they haven't had many people through there that actually stretch their ham strings on occasion) And sent home.&nbsp; I have a funky machine that keeps my leg in motion that use a lot of the day.<br /><br /></p>"

"event","I looked back recently at this year and realized that most of the work weeks have been at least 50 hours.  A lot of them have pushed 60. I'm ready for some 40 hour weeks but no chance in sight.  Bummer.  I've gotten up at 4:15/4:30 so long that sleeping late is 6:30.  I remember when noon was too early to get up because 4:30 was bed time.  

On the bright side Kung Fu is great.  I am having a great time and learning every week.  Can't ask for more than that."

"event","It has been a long, long time since I have really strained my brain for an extended period of time.  However, This week at work has really put it to me.  I am trying to learn alphabetic coding to describe every little bitty possible movement of the human body.  The codes are 4 to 6 characters long.  The instructor gives us some codes and their definitions and then we tell him the codes for a particular situation.  All day long.  All week long.  I think that I sang the alphabet in my sleep last night."

On our first round she came up with Elephant.  Ok.  I can do that.  The second round she named a donkey.  I dare you to sing that and make the sounds and not laugh."

We all out up this morning and went to do a little work on the church.  After all of the work was done Susan and I got a little grappling in.  Got to love a church you can fight in and no one gives it a second thought.  

I most likely won't get to KF Monday night.  Found out on Friday that I must work till 8 Monday night.  I don't think that the little woman would appreciate it if I didn't come home after work."

"event","Christmas is over.  Back to the usual.

Made a few resolutions but not too many.  I don't think that any of them are to give up something.  Most are to take up something.  I guess that I should try to drop some bad habits as well as pick up good ones but my theory is that if I get enough good habits maybe the bad ones will be crowded out.

Been sick to some degree since before Thanksgiving.  Everytime I thought I was getting well I would wake up the next day and be worse, but in a different way.  A couple of days ago it all attacked me at once.  I finally went to the Dr. last night.  He looked me over and pronounced me ""sick"".  All those years of medical school for ""sick.""  Two shots and three prescriptions later I do feel somewhat better today.  This from someone who never even takes tylenol or aspirin.  Usually I can cure myself with food or behavior therapy without polluting my body. This time bring on the pollution."

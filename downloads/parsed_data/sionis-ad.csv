"event","Sigh I always seem to update when I am feeling down, right now I am just sitting here not wanting to deal with another living soul for as long as can, but it never seems too last long enough.  At least school is out but then that brings up a bunch of worries such as if I should take summer class, my SUCK ASS FUCKING job, my friends, my girlfriend and Sigma Pi.  For some reason I have lost my will to try in life, it feel like a hole has ripped open inside of me like an old wound that never healed and is slowing devouring me.  I have lost my motivation for life, I mean the only reason I even tried to pass high school was for my parent because honestly I didnt care and right now I still dont and I relied on my girlfriend to get through this year at wayne but I am soo tired to using others as my motivation in life and I just cant seem to find anything else because I dont care about my feelings and well being.  To me a life without my friend and family is like suffering and I should be put out of my misery.  and just seems like I can do better and try harder to make the better grade and to do this and to do that, but I just dont care anymore. I just feel like crawling into the darkness and giving up. I just wish I could be the person every thinks I am, and sometimes I wonder how much they know me, I wonder if I even know myself. 

-Hurt-NIN

I hurt myself today
to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole
the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away
but I remember everything
what have I become?
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear my crown of shit
on my liar's chair
full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
beneath the stain of time
the feeling disappears
you are someone else
I am still right here
what have I become?
my sweetest friend
everyone I know
goes away in the end
you could have it all
my empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
if I could start again
a million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

Darkness consumes all without feeling,
no fear or joy only darkness
but under this darkness everything is one
nothing is different, so is this the perfect world
one without pain, happiness, 
one where everyone is free yet trapped
in this nothing know as life. 
But what if the darkness come from within
are you tainted, wrong, lost?
what if the hallow shell called a person does nothing,
but hide the darkness what then?
what to do, how do you fill a void
that has always been there?
how do you regain your humanity,
when what make you human is consumed in darkness,
how do you go on, what stops you from giving and dieing?
For you see i dont know but i hope to one day."

A black mark within the confides of my body,
containing only fear, sadness, and grief.
Yet, a light from God shown down through the dark,
Purifying everything exposed to its wondrous rays.
Now life feels worth living once again,
And no longer am i filled with desires to harm myself.
I owe my happiness, no my life to my love,
to my friend, to the only one who knows me.

Been up doing nothing much all nite here at a friends(whos asleep btw),but no then less i am keeping my self entertained with a game my girlfriend so lovingly bought me...something i will make up to your later when the time is right and ....well you get the idea.  I am still a little worried about her tho because i just recently found out she has a fresh cut on her wrist......  I have tried to end my life many times over the years but the thought of losing someone i care for to the point of stop trying to kill myself, almost cause me to hit something hard, i just wanted something else to be painfull so i didnt have to deal with what was goin on.  But as we sat there and talked i realized that moving the pain never helped before and is sure as hell is not goin to help me now.  All seams well for now tho, we talked it I found out some of the thing she was hiding from me(her wrist for one thing), our little chat(2hours)cheer both her and i up to the point of laughing about how stupid this was and how we were acting...

oh well time to get moving,

When i was wearing all the nice clothes ,sweet make up and fab hair i took another walk with the pood again &nbsp;and destroyed the hair. and now im here with a nice face and no1 to impress.

"event","&nbsp; this weekend was thrilling to say the least! Friday started off with a train ride to my dad's house, we went grocery shopping&nbsp;while my poor little poodle cried itself to hysteria&nbsp;in our car. She even pissed on the seat. Then about 30 minutes later when came home, the tv schedule was looking fantastic. CSI miami, law and order, criminal minds and then of course PSYCHO from 98 with vince vaughn, who is s00per hot. <br />Norman had just pushed the car with marion in the trunk down the creek when i fell asleep. <br />The poodle woke me up the next morning barking like the guard dog that she is. though a very bad one since what she barks at is only sounds coming from other apartments in the complex. So i put my fathers clogs on and took her for a walk so that she wouldnt pee all over the floor.&nbsp; <br />a couple of hours later my grandpa phoned and invited us to come over for dinner.&nbsp; <br />his wife cooked. not good. terrible frankly.&nbsp; <br />I walked there btw. its about&nbsp;9 miles, but when you're listening to music it feels like 2.&nbsp; <br />They&nbsp; told us about the floods theyd had around their summer house, it wasnt iintriguing at all but i pretended to care. theyre nice people. <br />today, sunday, when we got in the car and my dad was gonna drive me and my poodle home we discovered a flat fucking tire. luckily i wasn't in a rush to get home. My grandmother picked us up and drove us home and she gave me 30 bucks.&nbsp; <br />that was my weekend. cannot wait til next!&nbsp;<br /><br /><p align=""center""><img height=""146"" alt="""" width=""220"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dieucestdieu/pic/00004z9q/s320x240"" /></p><p align=""center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dieucestdieu/pic/00005409/""><img height=""147"" alt="""" width=""110"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dieucestdieu/pic/00005409/s320x240"" /></a></p>"

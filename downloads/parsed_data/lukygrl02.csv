"event","Okay... first off I want to apologize to any New Orleans Saints fans and to the New England Patriots fans for this, but it needs to be said and since I'm slow and just learned this information... So here it goes - 

THE BEARS ARE IN THE SUPER BOWL!!!!!!!!!
THE COLTS ARE IN THE SUPER BOWL!!!!!!!!!
*goes skipping around in the garage; screams wildly; sits back down in the chair; lights a cigarette*

Okay, I'm done now.

Actually, I'm not.

THE BEARS WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG! I couldn't believe it when I heard it, so I watched the game on TiVo just to be sure, and DAMN!

Really though, I thought it would be the Saints vs. Patriots, since the Patriots cheated at the last Super Bowl they were in, but hot damn!


I just realised something. I just made a shit load of money off my dad. WOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

later dayz

ps- as i said at the beginning of this, i do apologize to those fans, as my excitement can not be contained. Thank you."

"event","Okay, so here we are. A brand new year. Let me fill y'all up on my RL before I go into the world that is fiction.

1.) I quit Wal-Mart. They suck. I hope none of you ever have to stoop that low to work there. Yes, *nods head* it is truly that bad.
2.) Kohl's kicks @$$. That's where I work now. They are all so nice, and there's only like 15 guys that work there, so it's cool. Basically everything there is run by women. GIRL POWER!!!
3.) Mom is sick again. She's been sick since October. They don't wanna give her the meds she wants because they make her ""crazy"". I told them they need to live with her now and see that she needs that medicine otherwise she won't get crazy. Well yeah, whatever.





Now, on to the fiction!!!!!


I'm working on the sequel that I spoke of awhile ago. It should get sent to the beta's soon. I will post it at TSS.net ( http://www.thesilversnitch.net/ ) and to my LJ, along with the other LJ communities that I'm apart of.

I've also started other fics that are away from the HP fandom. It's RPS-based (real-people) so I've been working on that too. Those are coming along well, so I might post one of them too, if I can talk my beta into reading it for me, since she mostly does my HP stuff.

Let's see, what else to tell you - Oh, I know! I've finally found the second part to that fic with a dark!Harry and sorry!Draco. Now only to re-write it again and again until I send it to the betas.



That's it for today!

I was sitting in my garage, surfing the net because someone around my connection thing isn't on their internet so I'm ""borrowing"" theirs for a little bit, and a thought came to me. There was a contest over at TSS last july that I took part in and I went back and read the reviews again and thought to myself ""Hmm, I wonder if I can write a sequel to it."" So this is where you all come in; should I continue the story?

If you haven't read it, it's A SIGHT TO SEE over at TSS so check it out. *Shameless plug for the fic and TSS)

Please let me know if I should or not by replying to this. Thanks a bunch!

And it hasn't blown up yet so I guess that's a good sign. *grin* <br /><br />The bad news -- it only works with a wireless network. So, until I get my house connected up with wireless internet, I can only get on it during the times that I'm either at a hospital, school, or at a friends house that has it. Go figure. <br /><br /><br /><br />I haven't started copying anything over yet to this pc as far as stories go, but I do have some ideas floating around in my little head. I've been trying to write them down, but I haven't been able to write it out to my satisfaction. Hopefully I'll get them down soon.<br /><br /></font>
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Personal Stuff""><font size=""4"">Got a few bad breaks this month. One: my cousin found out she has cancer of the throat. She goes in for surgery on the 4th of October. My uncle went into the hospital Tuesday. Still don't know what's wrong with him, but they sent him home. He has to have surgery next week. My sister dropped a huge bombshell on me a few months ago, but I'm adjusting with that fairly well. Mom and Dad are doing okay, as well as I am. Although I've been off of work. I screwed up my knee again while I was at work. Fell off of a 16 ft. ladder. Well, I guess I didn't fall off, I just kinda slid off the damn thing as it was falling to the ground. So I'm getting paid for being off so it works.</font></div>

"event","Okay, for those of you who know me, you know I bet bored very easily. Horribily easy. So bored that I tend to get on here and ramble about nothing important, and important things. So since I'm bored, and you probably are too, I'm gonna talk about my puppy.

He's a black lab, approximately 6 months old. He eats everything and tears up toilet paper. Doesn't like people who tie their shoes, and he definately hates to be tied outside. His name: Draco Lucius.

Don't laugh yet. At least until I tell you HOW he got his name. On Feb. 9th dad brought him home. Mom picked him up and started saying different names, and then she started stating names from Harry Potter. When my sister called him Harry, his ears dropped. When I said Severus, he growled. When mom said Draco, he went balistic. So I said that was his name. End of discussion, you know.

Well, everyone else was like - NOOOOOOOO!!!! He cannot be named after a HP character. So they called him George. I said Weasley twin. Then they called him Ron, to which I replied Weasley. It went on and on for the whole night until they listened to reason and his name became Draco. Well, he needed a middle name, because it sounded weird without one, so I gave him his middle name, which is Lucius. 

So our puppy, Draco Lucius, is in fact a devil dragon. Just like a certain Slytherin we all know and love.

Now only if I can find a white lab I could name Harry James. Then a chocolate lab and name him Severus Septimus. Then I could really screw with my parents' and sister's brain. Muahahahahahahaha....

I got 16 pages (8 front-to-back) handwritten fic that I'm trying to transfer to my computer, but I've been having bad luck with it. First, my sister practically lives in the living room, where the computer is, and whines whenever we come downstairs in the basement because she never ""gets anytime alone"" and why do ""you guys have to bother me all the time"". I swear, I'm glad I'm not 15 anymore. She's at a friends' house tonight so I'm in the living room, making a mess. Throwing her blankets and pillows around and what-not. *shrugs* Serves her right for going to her friends' house.<br /><br />Okay, so I'm not actually throwing her stuff around.

"event","Okay, let me explain this before you all get sad and everything. Nothing happened in my family, nor did anything happen to friends of mine. One of our local radio stations went off the air yesterday/today at midnight.

Like I said, it's a sad day in my world.

If you live in Illinois or Iowa (Quad Cities) you will know what I'm talking about. Apparently the FCC said that ClearChannelRadio needed to sell one of it's stations. Well, our station was picked and it was bought by ERO or EFO. I don't know. *shrugs* Anywho, the sale was made this fall and wham! No more radio station.

The station is/was called --- ""WHTS-ROCK ISLAND"" All Hit 98.9. They had the best DJ's in the world. If you live in Wisconsin, you might be hearing one of our DJ's on the radio. The same in North Carolina. In Wisconsin: Malibu Mark Manuel (name here in the QCA) and in North Carolina: Tony Waitkeus.

I just had to share this. Everyone here will miss the 98.9 crew. Yes, we will even miss hearing Ryan Seacrest on Sunday mornings. *rolls eyes* And if you listen to John Garibedian last Saturday (1/28/06) it was mentioned, which I guess was cool. Cause now we won't get those two things anymore.

All because of the FCC.

Now I know what Eminem feels like.

It's been really long since I've updated this thing. *slightly twitches* Hell, I haven't checked my e-mail in a month and now I have 170+ in my inbox, and 98 in my bulk mail. All I know it that it all totaled to 279 UNREAD messages. That's not counting the 15 I saved from friends. *twitches more*

A lot has happened since I last updated. I got a job. I work at Wal-Mart. Yes, I know. You may all laugh now.

Spent my birthday at work which was a bummer, but I got a cupcake with a candle in it from them, so that was cool. Mom got sick again... she's not in the hospital again so that's good.

My kid sister is a sophomore this year. Stay in the middle of the street because she'll be driving soon.

-----------------

That's all I can think of to write at this time......probably because of the lack of sleep I've gotten in the past month. (since the 19th of July)

So....take care and later dayz"

"event","<P>So here we go. The spoilers. Any spoiler will be in RED. My thoughts about them&nbsp;in BLUE. <lj-cut text=""SPOILERS!!! - Take Caution""> </P>
<OL>
<LI><FONT color=#ff0000>Dumbledore dies by Snape's hand in the Astronomy Tower as the other Death Eaters look on.</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff> Snape had to do it. I don't see how he couldn't get around it. He had the Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa and possibly one with Dumbledore. Either way, he had to do it. If not, he would've died (because Draco possibly would've died if he tried). Also, with the disgusted look - I know I'd be disgusted if I had to kill someone that I cared for. Also, if he didn't he would've been suspected and killed by Voldemort. Which wouldn't have worked well with the last book. I do pretty much agree with what spoilers I've read tonight by different people on my flist.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT color=#ff0000>Snape is the Half-Blood Prince and Harry gets ahold of the potion book with the Half-Blood Prince's signature in it.</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff> I could see that making perfect sense after reading the book. So I guess I was half right in my guess a few days ago. It was a Slytherin, just the wrong one. After I read Chapter 9, ironically titled The Half-Blood Prince, and realized it was a potion's book with that inscription I kinda knew it was Snape. I mean, he is the best potion's master (as far as we know) in the wizarding world. And I think that Snape most definately knew that Harry had gotten ahold of the book somehow. Of course, it didn't help matters any that Horace Slughorn compared them to each other in Ch. 15. That and after Harry used the curse Sectusempra (Ch. 24). My only question is: Why did Severus let Harry keep the book? He had to have known that Harry would've hidden it so he couldn't get his hands on it. Maybe because he knew that Harry had the power to cast a Dark Curse and could possibly kill Voldemort.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT color=#ff0000>Chapter 23 - Horcruxes.</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff> We know that Dumbledore knew at least what some of them are/were. First, we have </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>Slytherin's necklace</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff> that his mother owned, along with the </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>Gaunt's Family Ring</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff> that his Grandfather (Marvolo) owned. We also know that Tom Riddle's Diary was one (now),&nbsp;and possibly Nagini could be one as well, for the simple facts that Dumbledore gave. </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>Hufflepuff's cup</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff> may be one for the simple fact that it belonged to a place that he wanted to stay at. That leaves 2 left. One I know has to be Voldemort himself. The part that Harry didn't destroy when Voldemort casts the killing curse at him. I think the last one may be either </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>something of Ravenclaws or even the Black Family Ring.</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff> I'd have to check, but maybe the Black's were descendants of Ravenclaw and that could be the last clue. It would explain why J.K.R. wrote about Mungdus having the ring and Harry noticing it quickly. Then again I could just be thinking hard. We know that Voldemort killed 6 people before Harry (including Harry's parents) and that Nagini killed one in the 4th book. That totals 7 horcruxes. Two have been destroyed. 5 more to go.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT color=#ff0000>The letter that was in the locket that was at the cave. </FONT><FONT color=#3333ff>Signed R.A.B. Regulus Black sounds like a good guess, which makes me think that it could be the ring and that's why Regulus died (but that's for a whole other post). Then again it could be another character we've never met (but I doubt it). *shrugs*</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT color=#ff0000>Snape <EM>FINALLY</EM> gets the DADA job and the the new character takes over potions.</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff> I think that should've thrown everyone into a big loop, thinking that Snape might die because that job's cursed (which we now know to be true) or something else, like killing Dumbledore for example, which means that we've lost another DADA teacher. Damn curse. I was just starting to like having Sev teach the class and he has to go and be all ""Gryffindor"" all of the sudden. *snorts into tea* Already discussed that p.o.v.</FONT></LI></OL>
<P><FONT color=#000000>And that's it for now. 5 wonderful spoilers and my thoughts on them. Pretty good for someone who never types long posts. :D Have fun reading/writing.</FONT></P>

<P>A few people were dissappointed with it, while others weren't. Myself personally, I didn't like how J.K. Rowling put it together, but it still caused me to think about what it all meant.</P>

"event","So far it's good. I'm NOT posting any spoilers until I completely finish it though. I got the first copy in my town (well, at least at the store I was in) so I've basically been reading it since midnight.... okay, 1:30a.m. but i'm on Ch. 14 now, so I think i'm making excellent progress. Of course, some of you who live in other parts of the world may already be finished with the book (lucky people that you are).

Lets see.....my friends and I (at the bookstore) talked with the manager and asked if we could do a scavanger hunt on anything Harry Potter. He said yes, so we literally splurged on like $100 bucks worth of Bertie Botts (Yes they actually have some at the mall we were at) and some HP stickers. We did it all by age group. We even had the ""older"" adults participating. It ended up being really good and the manager said we could do it again when the 4th movie comes out on DVD (sometime next year) and when the 7th book comes out (???) and WE GOT PAID FOR IT. Okay, so it was electronically but still. We now have like $40 bucks each at the bookstore that we can use to buy whatever we want. (Friends bought the book with it; me a c.d.)

The bookstore also gave us HP glasses (which makes all of us look like dorks) and a cool little green band thinggy that has an owl on it and it has today's date on it. I think the wristbands were in different colors though..not real sure.

Well that's it for me (at least tonight). Gotta get back to the book. Enjoy reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince!

"event","<P>Okay... now that the 6th book in J.K. Rowlings wonderful series is coming out (in one day) I thought I'd ask some questions:</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Questions!!!""> (note: possilbe spoilers to this. do not read if you don't want to know the questions.)</P>
<OL>
<LI>Who do you think is the Half-Blood Prince?</LI>
<LI>What is Lily Potter's big secret?</LI>
<LI>What stunt, do you think, is Voldemort going to try and pull this year? Does it have anything to do with the HBP?</LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Here's my answers:</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Luky's Thoughts...""> </P>
<OL>
<LI><FONT color=#ff0000>I think the Half-Blood Prince could be Hagrid, Gwarp,&nbsp;or Draco. Now hear me out before you all yell at me. Hagrid is a half-Giant. His mother (for all we/I know) could be the Queen of the Giants, and she left in order to keep Hagrid and Gwarp safe from Voldie. And since Hagrid's father was a wizard....<BR>With Draco - we don't know (since I don't think JKR said) if Malfoy is in fact a ""pure-blood"". We do know that Malfoys have always been in Slytherin, but how far back? Three, or four generations? We just don't know. Perhaps Lucius' parents could be muggle-born and gave Lucius to wizards when they found out he could do magic and boom. Ya know......</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT color=#ff0000>I think Lily's big secret is that she's a decendant from a wizarding family, and Petunia is a squib (hence why Petunia despises her sister.) Then again, her father could be Voldemort. *shrugs* Not real sure on this one though.</FONT></LI>
<LI><FONT color=#ff0000>Besides try to kill Harry..... I think he'll actually be at Hogwarts this year with a few of the DE's to capture and kill Harry. Or maybe he'll capture the HBP and try to get Harry to save him (like in the 5th book with Sirius) and something big will happen, like in the 4th book. </FONT></LI></OL>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Well, I think that's it for today. If you do get time, go out and buy the new book. I will, and I will go until Monday before I post on here again. I will place a warning on the LJ and any info in a LJ cut on the questions I asked tonight.</FONT></P>

I'm also going to be donating my story to TSS's Adopt-A-Fic. I just can't seem to get anything done on it...and the ideas are slowly leaving my head. I don't wanna leave it, but I have to. I will be taking it off of FF.Net and turning it over to the wonderful people at TSS. Hopefully it will actually be better when they get a hold of it.


In other news....
My uncle is living here. Even though he does go home from time to time, he sleeps here and both of his vehicles are parked here so he has moved in. I've been crashing in my sister's room with him. (Uncle on a very comfortable bed; me on a shitty futon bed) While my sister (little brat) gets to sleep in my comfy bed. Isn't that wrong of her??? I think it is.

Oh yeah, I got a fic search for you guys (who actually read this). This is all I remember:
1.) It was on ff.net
2.) Accident in potions class which results in Harry being sent to the future and Future!Harry being sent back to 6th or 7th Year at Hogwarts.
3.) In front of the whole potions class, Harry kisses Sev and leaves.
4.) Harry and Sev are ""fighting"" in the hallways and Harry tells Sev that 'his' Sev and him use that type of bantar as fore-play.
5.) The last time I saw this fic, I think it had either 8 or 12 chapters.

That's all I can remember. I did do a fic search of my own and can't find it, which sucks because it was starting to get good.

"event","Okay, as many of you know I am kinda glued to Harry/Sev and Harry/Draco fics. Well, as I was writing some notes on Chapter 10 of Bonds and Polyjuice about three different plot bunnies attacked. I had all three of them written out and started working on the first one before I realized what I was doing.
Then BOOM!
I lose my train of thought. (Tragic, I know) So I'm sitting there, at the kitchen table, with a blank face and my mom asked me what was wrong. I snapped out of my mini-daze and said, ""Nothing. Just zoned."" Quickly gathering the papers/notebooks/notecards/sticky notes/ etc. I head to the patio to continue. Well, lets just say that Chapter 10 never did get finished yet.

So here's what I have for you: the people that actually look at this. The Challenges. I will also place these on a few LJ communities so others can look at them. So here we go:

1.) A Harry-persues-Sev(orDraco) fic, in which our lovely hero has to seduce our favorite Slytherin before Voldemort attacks at the end of the year. It's part of a new prophecy that our favorite barmy old Divination Teacher predicts at the end of Harry's 6th Year. (Your own prophecy goes here) ::Don't care what the rating is, just as long as it's a Harry-persues-Sev(orDraco) fic.::

2.) After a one-night stand with Draco and Severus (seperately, of course) Harry becomes pregnant. He knows who the father is (Severus) but lets Draco believe that the child is his. Severus finds out that the child is his after Draco dies during the final battle. He then confronts Harry about it and Harry tells him the truth. (During this whole time, Severus and Harry do get closer, since Harry knows that Draco is working for Voldemort) ::This may need more clarification. E-Mail me for the details (lukygrl02 @ yahoo . com ) ::

3.) A Sev-persues-Harry fic, but with a twist. Dumbledore knows what will kill Voldemort. Harry being deeply in love with someone else who bears his ""mark"". After flipping a muggle coin he decides to tell Severus is plan. Sev isn't too happy about it but agrees that it would work. ::Would really like a nottotallyclueless!Harry, honestandopen!Dumbledore and a reallywouldliketogetdrunk!Snape.::

Yeah, so that's it. Could someone please adopt these plot bunnies so I could get Chapter 10 done? Please....pretty please with a cherry on top?"

"event","at least until the 13th of next month. Which is when Monica will be here and receive 2,000 bitch slaps.

Okay get this... my biology teacher e-mailed me right. She wanted to let me know what I was getting in the class. I passed the final, and she flunked me. I know why she flunked me...sexual discrimination.

She said at the beginning of the semester she does not ""tolerate homosexual behavior in this class."" I knew what she was talking about *really wants to slap friends that were in class with me* and thanks to some people that shall remain nameless she found out about my sexual preference.

I got an F. All C's and maybe like one D and she flunked me. I could so maim her for this it isn't funny. Why is it that teachers single people out with a different preference then themselves? I swear to God someone at the school will be hearing about this. Even if I have to go to the local newschannels and make myself be heard, it will be taken care of.

I tried to get out of this person's class, but I couldn't. I told people about this teacher and they said that I was a ""tough cookie and would pass the class."" WELL! I need a cigarette........


B&P is not working for me. I'm at another writer's block. GODDAMNIT!!! I so blame this on the teacher. Fuckin' bitch.


Enough ranting for now.....later dayz"

"event","Yep. Just what the title says. Almost done with 2 things.

1.) School - Been a very hellish year. Can't wait for it to be over. Possible summer school. *cries*

2.) Chapter 10 of B&P - I am planning to lock myself in the computer room until I am finished with this chapter (school, weather, and food permitting) That includes getting it to the betas and posted for your reading pleasures. *grin*



Other than all of that..... there's nothing else to report for the day.

"event","Well, I snuck out to the computer to write this so bear with me here, okay.

The ban is still in effect. Damn parents. Luckily we have computer's at the college, but my parents have my floppy disks, the *******.

Went to Raw is War on the 11th in Moline. Was pretty good. Skipped class to go, which is always a plus. Got all my computer homework done for this semester. That grade is back up to an ""A"". English 101 is at a ""C"", Psych 250 is at a ""C-"" and Bio 146 is bad. Worse than I thought thanks to that last test. It's at an ""F"". The teacher thinks I can get a ""D"" for the final grade, which means I'll be in summer school this summer bringing it back up. I swear, the damn teacher doesn't know how to teach that class. She doesn't explain anything and expects us to ace the tests and quizzes. My mom will KILL me if I flunk that class. *pulls hair out*

Gotta write a few papers for English and Psychology. Which I have to do tonight. Might work on them tomorrow, but they gotta be turned in by Thursday at the latest. I really hate school. *sigh*

Oh, on Thursday I got suckered into auditioning for a play. A buddy of mine threw the script at me, took my car keys, called my mom and told her we were going to study until 5something, and made me audition for it. I tried to beat him up, but the little *cough*peckerhead*cough* is too fast for me. Luckily I got a pack of cigarettes out of the deal. He called earlier (about 1:30a.m.) and told me that if I wanted the part that it was mine. Why must I be punished like this???

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything mentioned last week is still where it was last week. I WILL work on it Wednesday, since my parents won't be there to monitor my computer time. Muahahahahahahahaha.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, and I've read almost every type of Harry/Severus story out there, as well as Harry/Draco. If anyone of you that actually read this thing could rec a few stories I'd be your friend forever and you'd get a cookie. Please!!!"

Well, my school called and basically told my parents that I'm not doing too well in my classes. Still passing grades, just *sigh* almost flunking grades. All D's. And I only have 4 more weeks of school left. My computer privledges have been taken away until the grades come up (which they will) and yeah so....


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I did work some more on Ch. 10 of Bonds and Polyjuice before the ""ban"" went into effect. I have also decided that during this summer I'm going to revise it before sticking it up on here and on TSS (the silver snitch). If you've read it, then you know that it needs some work on it. My beta's can only do so much with what I write...

Also wrote a sequal to It Was Just A Game... gotta type it up though. I didn't like how I had ended it. It totally showed Draco as a heartless bastard (even though J.K.R. thinks he is)...so I decided that he wouldn't be. :D

Guess where I'm going!!! *giggles* John Cena won the SmackDown Championship belt against John Bradshaw Layfield, and Batista won the Raw Championship belt against Triple H.....oh and my uncle was there. He did two ""stunners"" and drank beer. All in all, it was a good WrestleMania.

I got a test in Bio tonight. It's over the Lymphatic, Respiratory, and Digestive System. Such fun.

Bonds and Polyjuice is still being worked on. I'm trying to get it to be as good as it was the first time before my cat got a hold of it. My family has restricted my time on the computer until I actually do my computer homework so.....

Untitled 1 is moving along, and I'm working on a story that's been sitting on my floppy for a few months. One of those will be put up here for your reading pleasure. I haven't read anything like either of these two stories so...

Right this very second. 

And she jumped on the keyboard. 

Thereby, hitting the mouse as well. Exiting out of WordPad. Making me lose everything but the first scene. *bangs head against the desk repeadily; grimaces at the sticky-ness of forehead*

I've already tried looking through all my temp files for it (since I hadn't placed it on my disk yet) and can't find diddly squat. Also, the papers that had my notes on it got drenched in tea as I tossed my cat to the ground and cursed her out. *glances at cat; cat busy licking paw*

So now, I'm stuck cleaning the sticky shi* off my computer desk, air-drying my notes, and practically being majorly pisse* off at my cat. *sigh* Can this day get any better? *hears a loud bang, followed by several curses and a crying baby*

Below are part of the lists, due to the fact that there are waaaaaaaaaaay to many authors out there that I enjoy reading. Enjoy.

-----------------------

Nsync
---
Rhys St. John - http://www.illuminations.nu/experimentv/
	Two Straight Guys In Wisconsin... - the BEST story in my opinion. although all of her stories are great and do enjoy reading them repeadily.
	Kink - A whole lot of kinks wrapped in one story. *sighs* Oh, and very funny as well.
	The Book of Secrets - the longest story I've ever read, but so good. 5 stars man. Don't forget the box of tissues.
	MPreg - the title speaks for itself, I think.
	
Synchronik - http://www.puppyshelter.org/joeseats/fiction.html
	Being Boring - the ode to the naked trampoline.....don't ask.
	On The Bus series - 45 in all.. and it's good. Very creative ways of writing.
	So-and-so is a girl: Three different parts. Very well written.

Doodlez - no website (that I remember)
        Beautifully Tainted- this could possibly be a HP/SS fic, if not for the fact that it's Nsync. Beautifully written, and I'm not just saying that cause she's my friend *wink*. The sequeal, Shades of Gray, is just as good.

*******

Harry Potter
---

Yih - (no clue...)
	any and all of her stories. beautifully written.
LeeLeePotter - (no clue once again)
	really love DETAH. what more can i say about it.
Ariana_Shade - http://livejournal.com/~ariana_shade
        really love all her fics (that i've read).......and not cause she's one of my wonderfully talented beta's. *grin*

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

SUMMARY - One Shot. Character Death. Matters of the heart aren't just a game.
PAIRING - surprise!
RATING - R
DISCLAIMER - NOT MINE. JUST BORROWING THEM FROM J.K.ROWLING. WILL RETURN THEM (albeit) SLIGHTLY DAMAGED.

A/N - Okay, this is not for the weak at heart. This is total angst. Forgive me. Also, to anyone who's waiting for Ch. 10 of B&P....it should be out (hopefully) at the end of Spring Break (March 10 - 20). I still gotta finish typing it out and let the beta's read it. Okay. Keep-a-readin!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It Was Just A Game

Tears cascaded down his face. His worst fears were coming true. The man he loves has rejected him. After giving him everything he had to offer, his love laughed and said, ""It was just a game.""

Those five words crushed him. Oh sure, he knew pain. Knew it rather intimately; after all, pain had been in his life sine he was only a baby. This pain, however, caused him to do stupid things...terrible things. Things only people like Voldemort thought about.

These things weren't foriegn to him. Not at all. Why would they be? Death and destruction followed him like a hawk stalked its prey. He just never took part in it, until now that is.

IT WAS JUST A GAME?!?!?!

He stood over his love's body; his wand was pointing between his love's silver-blue eyes. He killed a lot of people to get to him. Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Severus, Lucius. He even killed Voldemort and all of his Death Eaters.
""Why?""
""Because Draco, it was just a game."" Harry answered before screaming, ""AVADA KEDARVA!""

Harry looked down at Draco as the Auror's apparated in. He pulled out a muggle handgun and pulled the trigger.


The. End.

So, you like it? Hate it? Think I should just quit writing? Let me know!

My kid sister twisted her ankle last week. She has a ""soft tissue tear"". Basically, she tore some ligaments and tendons in the arch of her foot. *shrugs* She did it by kicking someone in a fight. *rolls eyes* Go figure.

Bonds and Polyjuice - Chapter 10 is almost finished. Just gotta finish copying everything over onto the computer before I can send it to the betas. *giggles* Apparently, Computer Science class IS good for something. :D

Untitled 1 - Have been neglecting it lately. But I do have a few more lines added to it. Just hard to find time to write, you know.

Also, for anyone who actually reads this blasted thing. I have a plot bunny for you.

You all know the song, ""Beautiful Soul"", by Jessie McCartney? If you do, I would like to read a story with that song as the basis of the story. You get what I mean? If not, just e-mail me or something. It's been in my head for a few weeks now, and I can't seem to get rid of it."

"event","Well, Wednesday night while at school, I fell backwards down about 20 flights of stairs and hurt myself badly. Badly enough that I've been crawling around my house all weekend. Very bad sprained ankle. I also tore all the ligaments and tendons (except my Achillie's tendon) in my left foot. Damn slippery stairs. I'm not in a cast, thank God. If I was, I'd probably have thrown the crutches under a very large mack truck and yelled, ""BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!"" as they got destroyed.

Next order of business: I really hate Biology class. Now hear me out. I'm taking A&P II (Anatomy and Physiology(2)) and we have to do a dissection in lab. I can't because:
a.) We have to cut open a cat and I have cats.
b.) Once something is/has been dead I refuse to touch it.
c.) I learn better from drawings and the plastic models.
HELP!!!!!!

---------------------------------------------------------------

Gotta figure out how to set up my little challenge I made for the HPRoundRobin. So far, only Amanda(something) and myself since I think it's only fair that the person issuing the challenge should start the story. I'll probably talk to Corgi about it later.

Bonds and Polyjuice --- Chapter 10 is trying to come out of my feeble little mind, but it's not working quite yet. I'm still trying though. I swear.

Untitled 1 --- I'm not sure if Ariana_Shade got it yet, since I haven't heard anything from her yet. Please e-mail me chick so I know where to send it to again, okay.

Untitled 2 --- Somehow this got deleted off my disk, so now I must search through the archives on After_Class and SnapeXHarryML and try to find it (since it was a challenge).

"event","RL is a bitch, ya know? First things first - Mom went into the hospital. She's home now (Thank God!).....then some weird things begin to happen. The cable shuts off, followed by the phone. So, after nagging both companies I found out what was wrong and everything was fixed. Then my sister gets suspended from school. Apparently someone ""ran their head into my locker like ten times! I swear! It's the truth.""
Lets just say that nobody bought that.
Then I find out that dermatologists can be very cruel when doing procedures with sharp objects on your face. *rubs cheek*

Lets see, what else can I share? Ah, I know. Around my hometown this last week something horrible happened. Something so bad that I'm not going to post it here, for fear that a little kid finds it and reads it. It's too gruesome(sp?) for anyone to read. Lets just say that ""OJ has come back to harm."" **if you know what I'm talking about then good, if not better work on your 90's trivia**
If you wanna know what happened, IM me on either yahoo or aim.

School: is a bitch, but I finally got my books and my loan back! YAY! My Psych teacher is very happy about that. So is everyone else, now that I think about it. *looks around carefully* I think they're plotting to kick me out of the house soon.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I'm thinking of putting Bonds and Polyjuice on hold until I can actually sit down and write out what I want it to say without it sounding like rubbish.

Untitled 1 - still gotta send that to Ariana_Shade. I'm working on it chick! I swear I am.

Untitled 2 is developing nicely. Hopefully it comes out okay.

Got a few challenges to post to the HPRoundRobin - just as soon as I find out how I can do that exactly. *grin*

Cause my cumulative G.P.A. is 1.76. 4 hundreaths of a point from making the cut. They also sent with these letters different guidelines. Well, I was reading them and I think I've found a loophole in it. *snickers like the Slytherin she is* They're so gonna be sorry when I'm through with them.

B&P is still stuck on Ch. 10. I can't seem to get the first part of the chapter written down. ARGH! I might have to stick this thing on the back-burner until I get out of this funk.

Untitled 1 is shaping along nicely. I've added and changed some parts of the beginning, so hopefully it flows better. I'm still waiting for Ariana_Shade to get back with me on that one.

Untitled 2 is just going to sit there and collect dust until I can figure out how to get the thing moving again. Shouldn't be too long, hopefully."

"event","Well, I joined a community (hopefully). It's in the subject line if you're curious. Now, don't bite my head off or anything when I explain why I decided to join this wonderful, spectacular community *is not sucking up in any way, shape, or form; snorts of disbelief, and amusement can be heard around the world*

1.) I know my writing is choppy (at best). My english teacher tells me that every chance she gets. I think, wait I know, that maybe they'll smack some of my writing around and tell me if it sucks or not. Wait, my beta's already do that..... Well, they'll just take up where my beta's leave off then. *grins*
2.) I have a lot of plot bunnies in my head and I can't seem to get rid of them. *tries to hand them off; gets them passed back* Most of them (hopefully) qualify their rules/regulations.
3.) The authors in that community are awesome. I read one story of theirs (that was recced to me) and fell in love with it instantly. They all just flow with whatever the first person starts with and they turn into beautifully written stories. *wishes for THAT talent*

Now, I'm done sucking up.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Bonds and Polyjuice is still giving me a headache. ""Untitled 1"" is slowly being put together so I have enough to send to Ariana_Shade (one of my wonderful beta's). 
I also have another story in the works. 
""Untitled 2"" is a challenge from (forgotten name) on one of the many Yahoo! Groups I'm in. It's shaping along nicely. Gotta call Doodlez though and get some more ideas flowing for that one though. 

Other than that, that's all I really have for today. If you've read B&P, then maybe leave a comment here, so I know where you (the readers) want this to go.

"event","Here's what I did this New Year's Eve....

We had a huge party this year. Well, my sister did, at least. Mom went out and bought all sorts of stuff for the ""chitlins"" (as I call them) and 8 wine coolers for the adults. Well, the kids wanted to try some. With wide eyes, we told them ""Okay, but go back in Dances' room and we'll bring them to you."" 

After they all ran back in my sister's room, my mom pulled out Strawberry and Blueberry kool-aid and began making kool-aid. Looking at her in shock, I asked, ""What are you doing?""
""Making some wine coolers. Grab the vinegar.""
Rolling my eyes I decided to just do what was asked of me. I grabbed it and handed it to my mom. ""Okay. Taste this and tell me what you think."" Plugging my nose I took a swallow. ""Taste better then beer.""
""Good. Now drink these."" 
Looking at my mom like she was crazy, I quickly downed four wine coolers. 

Sadly, I don't remember what happened the rest of the night.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Bonds and Polyjuice is still giving me a headache. I honestly don't know what to do with the damn thing. Although I have begun working on another story, which doesn't have a title yet. I'll refer to it as ""Untitled 1"". It'll probably be a HP/DM story.... unless it takes on a life of it's own.

For those of you who have been reading my fic Bonds and Polyjuice (http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1875975/1/) I have some bad news.......writer's block has decided to camp out in my head and on top of my muse. *sulks* I've tried, but so far, don't get your hopes up for a new chapter for a while. I do have a few more stories in the works though....and as soon as I find out how to post them up here, then you'll get to see them. *grins*

"event","One day this nice, happy little fly was flying around this large farm. She looked down and spotted this large, good-smelling (to the fly) pile of maneuer. She flew down to have some dinner. She ate and ate. Then she ate some more. When she was done, she wiped her face off and tried to fly away. She couldn't. So, after trying repeatily she realized that she ate too much and wasn't going to be able to lift herself off the ground. Looking around the yard, she saw a pitchfork leaning against the barn wall. So she painstakingly walks over to it and climbs up it thinking ::I'll jump off of it and be able to fly away::. Once at the top, the fly takes a big, deep breath...closes her eyes and jumps.....
SPLAT!!!
The nice, happy little fly died.

The moral of the story is:

Don't Fly Off The Handle When You're Full Of Shit.


*bows* thank you, thank you.

For those of you reading Bonds and Polyjuice...Ch. 10 is coming along nicely. It might be out after New Year's though (Jan. 1, 2005) 'cause Christmas is this weekend and all that.

"event","Yesterday was pretty dull and boring me and jessica just sat aroundin my room and watched moovies waiting for andrew to call.. then after a while we decided to go somewhere because there was nothing else to do.. then right before we left andrew called and then we decided to meet him at the park. on the way there it was really muddy. and me and jess couldn't resist so were just messing around and were throwing wet stuff at eachother.. then we just pushed eachother around in the water and got really wet.. We went sliding and are butts got vury wet.. we were freezing so we decided to go home, but while we were going through the park my shoes got stuck in the mud and i was knelt over na djessica gave me this crazy look and ran up to me and push me down so i fell backwards into the mud.. it was the most amazing push i have ever seen.. it was great.. so i went to chase her down and my shoes fell off so i just said screw it and we made a truce( or however you spell it) which didnt last long but eh whatcha going to do... and then we went home and had to watch my brothers and sisters for about 5 hours and it was crazy because we had to scream at them and then we lost our voices a little.. i hate kids.. but anyways today was ok the sub in gym was pretty sweet! oyah i forgot to say that me and chase had to change pants in my front yard it was funny because we were really muddy and my sister had to bring us shorts. but anyways how bout that sub it was fun played some b-ball with oso, hulan,shelley,kylie, and sparr.. it w as fun but then i got thrown on the floor from sparr it hurt but o well.. this weekend might be ok me and jess might go with matt and some other people to that concert thing and then he is supposed to have a party but who knows... i am going to go to my locker now so stheeya

"event","Today is really major super gay nothing is going right. i left this damn can of pepsi in my back pack and some how it got a hole in it and spilt all over my folders and notebooks and the inside of my back pack has marker in it because the night before i got bored and colored my notebook and all of the colors were running every where.. so i didnt go to science until 3/4 of the class was over, didnt go to history until 10 minutes were left because i went to a lunch with jess. eh what ya gonna do...? and guess what? as planned this weekend is screwed up.. which sucks hopefully somehow i will be able to hang out with andrew. yesterday didnt do much ,hung out with my mikey and katie and got yelled at by my mom because i spent her money which i wasnt supposed to but who cares... she got over it after i went upstairs and watched a mooovie and listened to muusic .. i really want to go home but i dont think i am going to maybe i just will go to the nurse or something for 7th hour because i hate algebra it use to be fun when i sat in the back and got to talk but now there is nothing fun about it well isnt this just gay...

how the hell did jesus really walk on water...? 

He was probably floating on a duck raft but the people just didnt look down at his feet.. 

Probably because he told the people if they did look down they would spend an internity burning in hell.. 

damn ........

but anyways i think we had math homework but mine got soaked by damn pepsi...huuu.. i cleaned my room last night finally. i should probably be doing this spanich assignment but i dont wanna and this history project but again i dont wanna.. and i am going to try to find the funniest website in the worl so stheeya-

You know whats a really really good show FRIENDS thats a awsome show! i hope i get to do something with andrew this weekend but some how it will get screwed up and once again i wont be able to see him. that would suck.  i doubt we will get to go to melvin's so i hope we can all hang out somewhere else. tht would be sweet. i am definatly craving one of those breakfast sandwhiches right now. huuu.. i want to move really really bad but i have to wait a copule of more weeks. At the dollar store there were star wars puzzles they were bitchin..i am surrounded by alot of gay people but not jessica and this girl she has a stash and it is kind of bugging me but whatever.. well i have typed enough i think unless something else comes to my mind CHICKEN IN A BISCUIT IS IT GAY? IS IT GAY?  well thats about it . besides once again my step dad and mom got into an argument at 6:30 this morning they can never be happy for more than one day i dont know how they can still be in love but eh whatever floats there boat. yah know. well stheeya~
o yah one more thing my step sister had her baby yesterday morning the baby is only 5 pounds but considering the fact that my step sister is only 16 that could be why but whatever.

"event","Well ja heez this weekend was gay..yes yes it was. All i did saturday was sleep and watch my little sisters gay dvds and man were they gay. Didnt talk to andrew all weekend. And for some reason i think he is mad at me or hates me or something. And today in gym everyone said they got drunk huuu..... and i wasnt one of them..  i was at my dads doing NOTHING! went to church sunday at this girl kept spanking this guy in front of me and it was kind of weird because we were in church but whatcha gonna do.. and then i fell asleep and my dad pinched me and made me stand up... i do not like church escpecially when it's like 2 hours.. Then i came back to my mom's house and cleaned my room a little then jess came over and we sat in an awkard silence for about 10 minutes..odd.. then andrew called..sweet.. then jess talked to him and i played with my bitchin ferret, then she scratched me , so that whore went back into her cage.. Then we went to the store and bought sardines and marshmellows... then we had a contest to see who could eat the most when we discovered they still had there spines we threw them away they were vury vury disgusting.. then we had another conutest to see who could fit the most marshmellows in their mouth at one time, i choked and spit them out.ew. You know what would suck.. if andrew was, mad at me. and i hope this weekend turns out to be awsome because i would get to hang out with jessica and andrew whoot whoot! Stheeya

Got some sweet shoes from dollar store... $4.00 pretty kick ass.. you know who the sweetest people are JESSICA MELVIN and ANDREW TOMCZAK and of course Christine Fairchild...god damn are they awesome people.. i hope me and andrew go out for a long time, because i like him soo much! i hope jessica figures out what she's doing..we have gotten into alot of arguments lately..odd.. It sucks though that i dont get to hang out with andrew at all and i barely talk to him which sucks, but for some reason i am still nervous around him. well not exaclty nervous but kind of shy so i dont act myself which is definatly not shy.. but o well.. and again it's tooo late to get high!

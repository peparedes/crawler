_________________________________________________________________________________
This time you should know 
Like the first time that 
I saw you there alone 
Like the first time that 
I knew you were my own 
The way you made me feel 
Like I was something that 
You couldn't live without 
Like I was someone that 
You couldn't be without 
Something came in between us 
Something made a change in you 
What can I do? 
So you made your decision 
I guess it's you that I'll be missin' 
I lie alone in bed just wishin' 
That I had been the one 
That I had been the one 
This time you should know 
The way you made me feel 
So helpless and alone 
Erase the memories 
Of all we've ever known 
Something came in between us 
Something made us break in two 
What can I do? ......

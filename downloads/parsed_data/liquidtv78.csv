"event","Later on this day, after my trip to the museum that left me aching to get back into my book, OK let me bitch for a second On showcase there was this incredible map used by the colonists in the revolutionary war, and I would have been able to enjoy it if it were not for the lack of an extra 2ft of legs. If I only would have grabbed that stepladder from the side of the street... So I get back on the bus and into my book. A few chapters later Im on to another bus. Already underway about 100 yards ahead I can see the final bus that will take me home With people around me, watching me glare forward with imperfect vision between the shoulders of two ladies in front of me, I turn to this beautiful young African goddess. She is just one of many offended looks. Turning to her I pause then grumble slowly, Thats my bus. Words without cohesion Im staring at her, from 2 ft. away. This Nubian queen, with features that imply infinite wisdom. I take a picture with my photographic memory, maybe. I get off the bus and walk over to the schedule posted nearby. 5:45, 6:15, 7:10 6:20, my watch says, smirkingly. I know Im gonna be here an hour I head into the nearby Starbucks to find a banana nut cake and a chubby Korean looking girl behind the counter who says something that my mind doesnt process. I hear it as, bah, bah were closed. and with a stupid look I ask, what? Oh by all means take your time. She said clearly this time. I was ready but being courteous I waited a few seconds before saying in a loud quiet voice Ok. Some banana nut cake and a small coffee with a shot of caramel. I was talking to her backside wondering if she heard me when appearing out of nowhere the manager was at the register ringing me up in his green shirt. It matched perfectly with the green cabinets. He spoke over his broad, camouflaged shoulder Tall coffee, shot of caramel. The girl handed me my cake in a paper bag and asked, Anything else? turning away abruptly while I said A plate and a fork please? She handed me my SMALL coffee as I stared at her blankly asking clearly Plate and fork? The manager ONCE AGAIN appeared out of thin air with his huge torso and a plate and fork and said, Here yah go bud. I fucking hate the word bud. So I turned away silent with my $4.37 shit and receipt and set a table. While fixing my coffee my clumsy left hand dove into the sugar, and grabbed 3 bags of natural brown crystal sugar. I noticed I had a slight headache. You sugar whore, I thought to myself grinning cunningly while pouring it in. A little milk, stir, lid, and walk back to the table and I overheard the conversation behind the counter Shes a good person, she just doesnt have good people skills The manager said, and I repeated it out loud as I walked by, people skills. They both chuckled in some strange smart-ass way that mirrored my own personality I threw the hefty Korean girl who was now scrubbing the floors a look that said, get it? for a second then thought something I should not have said... People skills... The way an individual deals with people? Haha More like the way people deal with your individuality should you choose to have any. I should not have said this. I didnt, for the fear of broadcasting a large concept onto a small mind. Squish! Hahaha. I take a sip of coffee that makes me cringe. The first sip always does this to me. Its the feeling of having something like chewed coffee beans spoon-fed to you while your blind folded, told beforehand its sugar. This cup of coffee is mostly sugar Thank god for the caramel chaser to wash away the horrid under-taste. I start reading my book again while listening to the sound of the floor being scrubbed and some African techno beat playing over the speakers. But I keep getting distracted by these smart-ass stupid comments people have to make about the floor being wet as they walk by. Distracted, I instead write to pass the hour. As I write my head doesnt hurt, my wrist doesnt ache, my hand doesnt cramp like it always does, and I am reminded, Oh yeah, this is why I drink coffee."

"event","Once, in my freshman year of high school at lunch, I sat or stood near this kid I knew.  I didn't really like the guy so much but he was little like me so we talked....  But not today.  Today he was being talked TO, by this prick ass kid that lives down the street from him.  The actually have the same first name, and they are both assholes for that matter. 

This asshole is talking right over him right into his ear My friend is slumped over like a bum sitting in an alley while this fuckers shadow is on top of him, forked tounge in his ear.  Im watching and im listening but all I hear are pronouns; I, you, we, you , your, fuckin ass...  This this kid jumps up.  Over my friends head, over this asshole, casting a shadow on HIM.  This tall geek of a man who surely had endured countless words himself.  The words written on the faces of the entire cafeteria, all focoused on him, and he talked right over this mothafucker, Right in his ear, and it wasn't hard for this 6'2 pile of bone and acne.  He spoke in words all very noble and clear to this punk-ass turned all noddy, forked tounge buried back in his throat...

My friend sat still hunched over his lunch with an even bigger shadow on him now.  And then it was over and I sat down with my friend and asked him...  ""So man, what are we gonna do later on?""  It was a good conversation too.  Maybe because the cafeteria was a little quieter that day.

 

It was one big cheezy movie at the time to me...    and i cant tell you what made me remeber it today"

"event","I feel like a shadow. 
A reckless unrealized version of myself. 
Maybe from loss of sleep, overworking, changes in metabolism. 
I DID start a daily exercise routine. 
I feel like just a cask of unimportant questions and ordinary opinions. 
I went to the bank today. 
Yesterday I gave out my pin .. to my debit card. 
Not on purpose, the lady on the phone just asked for it so I gave it to her. 
It turns out she wanted the verification code thats printed on the back. 
I asked the teller if I could change my pin .. without getting a new card. 
She asked her manager who looked at me and shook his head very expressionless and slow 
Back and forth. 
My vision shot to the tag like ribbon cascading out of his shirt pocket. 
A dull silver badge, it said, we care. 
I looked back up at his head, very still as if at rest from recent decapitation. 
Is he human? 
I was pondering his thoughts of the concerned look on my face. 
He started to mumble something 
Regardless of what he started to mumble, my response was already chosen.
Ok, Thanks i said, and left casually.

I feel like I need to have my fluids topped off. 
A fresh fill of, freshness. 
I'm hungry, and I have to do laundry. 
Both seem pointless. 
The people where I work think I should do stand up comedy. 
I have a very dark sense of humor about the world around me. 
It wont sell. 
My cats stay in my room and just lick themselves all day. 
I dont know weather to envy them or pity them. 
This is starting to feel like a student film. 
This does not automatically imply integrity. 
Anyone know who Steven Wright is?

You are the all knowing, all seeing, soon to be Conditioning Specialist Scientist.

A failure at one of the critical factors conditioned into this orginized soceity. Is his failure to fit in, a glitch of this infallible system?

this tar carves its way down into the floor
this, necrophelia oozes from every outlet
it is the cessant thought that is flowing forth
creeping darkness stopping all control
embrace this...
a cunning psychotic characature overcomes my face as i taste the raw emptiness.
my tounge swells in my throat like a predator ready to strike
then a chill... and the seething is dapped away like the ash from a cheap cigar...
no beauty, no hate, no thought..."

"event","Here is an exerpt from the book Heart of darkness. In this part the main character watches the death of another man. This man represents all the evils and dark insticts that plague man, everything corrupting in us...

""Anything approaching the change that came over his features I have never seen before, and hope to never see again. Oh, i wasn' touched. I was facinated. It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that ivory face the expression of sombre pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror--of an inense and hopless despair. Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision--he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath--
"" ""The horror! The Horror!""

This made me think... perhaps true redemption only lies at the last moment of ones life. For seconds we can be pure and then vanish from existence in that state. Pure. Free from the sin that would inexorablily follow... Vanity."

"event","i see your face, from my tunnel, dim lit
in a chamber i sit, while robbing you of your punishment
the strain on your face then momentous disclosure
you find peace in this world from your overexposure
your decision... Blast! you fool! how could you so hastily
invade your life with darkness, you embrace it?
but now as i enter your mind and your thoughts i see 
what had caught your attention in voracious degree
a quick glance was all i recieved, and all i needed
my conclusions were simple (like your mind, now defeated) 
once i saw the light from inside your mind...
and then burst through the skin throu the hair, to the wall
and i carried your brains, and scattered them all"

"event","Joseph Conrad was a man of many languages. Born in Belgium into a polish family, he grew up reading french and polish translations from great authors such as charles dickens, sir walter scott, and james fenmore cooper. Is it beacuse English was his THIRD language that he can eleqouently, almost spiratually, put words on a page that so amazingly paint an image or a feeling into your mind... i belive that is the case, not that this wonderful text was just the school of thought back then and it just rolled off of everyones tounge...

Here are some exerpts from the book im reading and very much enjoying, Heart of Darkness, a book about a man on a merchant's jouney down the congo river through the jungle in africa at the higeht of european colonialism...

I saw him extend his short flipper of an arm for a gesture that took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the river,- seemed to beckon with a dishonoring florish before the sunlit face fo the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the hidden evil, to the profound darkness of its heart. It was so startling that I lept to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as though i had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of confidence. You know the foolish notions sometimes. The high stilness confronted these two figures ( the two people gesturing toward the jungle on the bank , beside his boat)... with an ominous patience, waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion.

In and out of rivers, streams of death in life, whos banks were rotting into mud, whos waters, thickend into slime, invades the contorting mangroves, that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an inpotent despiar. Nowhere did we stop long enough to get a paeticularized impression, but the general sence of vague and opressive wonder grew upon me. It was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares.


Thanks you Hunter S. Tompson for mentioning this book in YOUR book, The Rum Diaries"

You are aloof, mysterious, and distant.
People feel like they really don't know the true you...
Yet they're still drawn to you, almost by magnetic force.

Underneath it all, you don't even really feel like you know yourself.
It's easier to put on a front than really think about your life's purpose.
You tend to seem pretentious, but it's just a mechanism you use to push people away.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatsthepartofyouthatnooneseesquiz/"">What's the Part of You That No One Sees?</a></div>

"event","Anna Nicole Smith has actually died.  I always feels like she will get better but she is not sick or anything, the poor baby, first her brother dies

MY THEORY: Murder or suicide

She had a child with a 90 year old man, that cannot be healthy however it was 20 years ago.

She had a drug and drinking problem but decide to go clean acouple of years ago.

What could have happened?  HMMMMMMMM, well there is TRIMSPA baby!

Trimspa is not approved by the FDA, for all we know it could be pieces of rat shit.  It could be an acting out as if it were a drug.  However!!!! she just had a baby and any doctor could not just let her have a baby and not tell her that something is wrong.  On Febuary 7th, JUST YESTERDAY!!! Trimspa was sued by a woman who did not lose any weight and says that it is bogus.  Apparently Smith is responible for it.  I heard Marlin Brando died because he was in debt 20 millions dollars.  HMMMMMMMMMMMMM, suicide.

Another theory is that her second husband had children and found out that she was having another baby and wanted to have their fathers money instead of giving the money to the child. HMMMMMMMMMMM, murder.

What do you think?"

Bottom line, you are good at playing by the rules.

A hard worker, you give your all at whatever you do.
You're very serious, and people often tell you to lighten up.

In love, you tend to take things carefully and slowly.

At work, you are suited to almost any career - but you excel in leadership positions.

With others, you tend to be polite and formal.

As far as looks go, you are traditionally attractive. You take good care of yourself.

On weekends, you tend to like to do organized activities. In fact, you often organize them!</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/threequestionpersonalitytest/"">The Three Question Personality Test</a></div>

No need to spend a whole lot, unless you are absolutley certain that you are going to be with this person, but for me, I would probably think that it would be a waste of money and people's time.

You are perfect to rule Jupiter, because you are both dominant and kind.
You have great strength and confidence, but you never abuse your power.

holy mother of crap, so there are these three guys in my house, tow middle age, and one young one, big tool belts and shaved heads, or maybe they are just bald.  One might take advantage of the situation but I got decided not to on the count of them making fun of mentally retarded kids.  One guy couldn't remember the title of the movie snatch.  (lets hope they were talking about the non-porno)

Two of the went to my high school graduated in '87 and one in '01.  

then they yelled over to me if they asked if i like a man who hasn't showered in a long time.  

I answered ""..... uh no""

they continued, and carmen is getting a little scared but excited to see these guys walking through he, only one of them told me his name which is the same name as CANADA's name, (inside joke with amy)  

One of them reminds me of Doctor Dave Robbins, fucking awesome.  And he kind of looks like him too, even cooler, we should all just smoke it up if they get a chance after they are done.

They are all wearing the same thing so technically they are men in uniform! LOL!!

anyways, now they are talking about the caulk on their handles.  Could this get any dirtier?  They blocked me in so I can't go anywhere until they leave first.  

I shall update on you people later. Oh man it smells like the 90's with all that burning wood smoky smell in my house, mmmmmmmmm

Actually wait a moment I think they are about finished.  Cool cause I am exhausted, LOL, but seriously, I'm cold and hungry, and I work soon.  

At least they didn't say after it was all done, 'how you feeling?'"

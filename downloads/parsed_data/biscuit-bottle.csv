A pigeon had made its way down through the net but had trouble finding its way back out. A girl got very upset about the pigeon being so close to her, so she&nbsp;started flailing her arms about and shrieking. This scared the poor pigeon so much that it flew right into my shoulder."

"event","I was playing go-fish with a handful of eight-year-olds and happened to be lucky-guessing. I managed to win most rounds without bothering to try or remember who previously asked for what. Then Amanda accused me of cheating. I told her that I could see through the backs of the cards to know what they were. At this point I&nbsp;started playing with the intention of convincing them that I really could see through playing cards. After a few games of &quot;magic&quot; Amanda told me that it was my glasses and that I couldn't do see through the cards without them. With a fair bit of concentration I played without the glasses and with my ability to see through the cards. A skeptical little boy told me that I was just lucky and I that I couldn't name a card he randomly pulled from the deck. At this point, I assumed the jig was up but guessed anyway. I called the 7 of diamonds.

"event","<p>My dad, my aunt, and I&nbsp;went caving. We got to a place where we would have had to crawl to continue. I was all for it, but my dad said he was too big and too old to try it. So we stopped. He told us to turn off the lights and listen to the quiet. Well, as soon as the flashlights went off, we heard a noisy bunch of teenages. We sat, in the dark, waiting to scare them. Mean, but oh so much fun. My dad flashed his light a few times. One of the teenagers said 'shhh, turn off your lights."" Well, after that we didn't play with ours again. As their flashlight beams shined on us, we could hear ""THERE'S A BODY BACK THERE!"" <br /><br /></p>"

"event","I live in a dorm that's exclusive to the Honors program, so most people don't ever get to see it. Well, there's a rumor circulating that we have&nbsp;a swimming pool in our basement. And we all confirm it, as we do actually have a pool in our basement. The thing is, while everyone is sitting around jealous, we're laughing because they don't know that it's one of those plastic pools you put in the front yard for little kids. We only use it for stomping grapes."

"event","A long time ago, when I was in middle school, I attempted 3 way calling. I was, and somewhat still am, technologically challenged. I was talking to Megan, when we tried to call Brittany. Well, we got Brittany's answering machine. So we hung up (or at least we <em>thought</em> we did). As it turns out, Brittany called me later to tell me that Megan and I had somehow managed to record a 20 minute conversations about the boys we go to school with as their answering maching <strong>greeting</strong>. Opps."

"event","I went to camp the summer after my freshman year of high school. The boys went out bowling for their hall activity. Our counselors, on the other hand, planned for us to ""decorate"" the boys' bathroom. Armed with 3 rolls of pink streamers, a dozen teen magazines, and a poster of John Mayer, we attacked. (It is possible that I may upload pictures.) Now, the best part of this is, undoubtedly, the expressions of boys who have seen our handiwork. We held a ""meeting' outside the bathroom door. We had a good laugh and asked each boy not to tell anyone else because we wanted to see ALL the facial expressions possible. It was reported that they left the decorations up for almost 2 weeks before removing them."

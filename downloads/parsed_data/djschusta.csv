"event","Ya so I was home in L-town for kel's prom. She looked so incredibly beautiful, I was the luckiest guy there. Despite some drama here or there, it was just completely worth it to get to be with my kel all dressed up. It was just really good to be able to come home and see her before I have to finish this last little stretch of school

which brings me on to the next thing, it is official that I am moving back home now. Right now my plan is to go to UMASS lowell for a semester until I can transfer to UMASS Amherst in the winter. But I am considering some other things like make trying for UVM or some schools in boston or something. But it is looking pretty much like UMASS Amherst and living in londonderry for the first semester unless I somehow get into Amherst which is looking sketchy since it is so late right now.

but I guess that is that and this is this. so peace to your mama's crease yo

"event","I definitely recomend you all go to see Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind. It was certainly an excellent movie. One of the best movies I've seen in theaters for a long time. Not only was it a great movie, but there was a fucking awesome trailer for Garden State. It recently won Sundance, and has Natalie Portman and some dude from scrubs in it. But it looks really weird and interesting. I am mad excited...

I saw Dawn of the Dead today too, because I am a fan of the original. I wasnt expecting much and I figured they fucking butchered the original, which they did, but I also feel I didnt waste my $7.50 on the ticket. It was somewhat entertaining, but also very cheesy.. watch it on dvd or tv or something.

I'm coming home in exactly 7 days for kelly's prom. It is going to be mad fun. I am a little stressed out because I am still working on the after party bungalow. It is just a matter of getting ahold of the guy dude people persons. I mean for my prom we got them the day before, so it is no biggy. I am sooooooooooooo excited though

today I realized just how bad I suck here. Ok well my cable is out because my roomates account is fucked up and he cant pay the bill for a couple days. Not his fault, no big deal. But I mean, I HAVE to watch the new South Park thats on tonight.. So I am thinking, no big deal I'll just call up one of my friends here to watch over their house.. Ya and then I realized I dont have one fucking friend I could call up to watch south park with. NOT ONE. I suck so bad. Out of the few people I know, I dont think I could ask any of them to watch south park over their place. Thats how much people suck here... What a horrible horrible day.

Oh that was sweet, the computer I am on fucking sucks. The monitor keeps on cutting out and it takes about 3-5 minutes for it to do it's little color test before it wants to start working again.. really makes me want to fucking get started on my lab reports.. so you think I am in a computer lab and I could easily get another computer... NOPE. There is a 30 minute line to get a comp.. so I am fucking stuck

"event","So I had an incredible week in Colorado with Dave, my mom, bro and cousin melissa. 7 days of insane skiing at 6 different mountains

Day 1: went to breckenridge and skiing was mehh
Day 2: Skied Copper Mountain and found some decent stuff. Dave and I tried to get a snowcat ride to this backcountry peak but we just missed the last fucking ride.. assholes
Day 3: Skied Vail and it was absolutely huge! I have never seen anything so fucking big. Of course Dave and I found one good trail and skied that one all day but never went the same way twice. Then we went to Bubba Gumps Shrimp Factory, the best Mahi Mahi piled on top of mashed patatos and loaded with shrimp EVA! Luckily this time dave and I didnt have to free mahi mahi all over the place
Day 4: Skied Keystone... I wasnt impressed. Blahh
Day 5: Skied A-Basin in the AM. They got about 6 inches of snow towards the top of the mountain. Awesome mountain! But then Dave and I skied down the backside of the mountain and got stuck towards the bottom. We had to make a traverse across the mountain and it was an hour ""hike"" in snow that got as deep as our heads. I say ""hike"" because half of it the snow was so deep we had to crawl in order not to sink in too deep. Fucking horrible, I have never done something so hard in my life. Then we went to ski Breckenridge in the afternoon. They had some new snow too. I guess in the summer the locals make these hidden rails in the backcountry out of trees that not many people are supposed to know about. Well I found one and I made dave do it. It was neato. Then Dave tried hiking like 20 feet up to this cliff we knew about from last year. He fell through the snow into a stream and was stuck there for like 5 minutes. I was laughing sooo hard but dave didnt think it was funny at all and got PISSED!
Day 6: Drove 2 hours to steamboat. It was fucking insane! They got 18 inches of snow the day before and about 8 more inches over the night I'd say. So we just had an insane amount of powder we didnt know what to do with. So much fun! Except Dave and I were completely dead after 6 straight days of skiing but we did it. I was skiing behind Dave through some trees and there was this hole in the snow. I tried to jump over it but I fell backwards into it... it just happened to be a hole into a stream and my ass dipped down into it and my skis were straight up into the air. Snow was falling down over my head and I couldnt breath, and I was definitely stuck bad and in a fucking horrible position. Then I heard a ridiculous amount of people laughing at me soooo hard.. When the snow stopped falling over my face and I could breath again, I realized I was right under a chairlift and everyone was making fun of me!! It was horrible. Thats what I got for laughing at dave the day before...
Day 7: Back to breckenridge. I made Dave do that hidden rail again and he fell and broke his pole after we had been talking all week about how sweet his bent fucked up poles were... RIP Pole... We were so tired we couldnt even turn so we just gave up after about 2 hours to save us from the agony... Then we went down to Denver to spend our last night before flying out. Dave listened to bright eyes and I tried slitting my wrist, but dave got pissed so I let him be. There is a South Park episode about this mexican place called Casa Bonita in Denver.. so of course I looked it up to see if it was real, and then I made us go there for dinner.. What a fucking good idea.. It was like a taco bell luxory chuck e. cheese! Mexican food galore. Cliff Diving in the restaraunt! Gun fights! Caves! Mariachi band and my mom getting drunk and taking pics of their asses! Then a gift shop where dave stole and two cops randomly come in after to flirt with the clerk!! Pure craziness! FUCKING AWESOME.

So now I am back in school and I realize how much I hate it here. I cant wait to get out of this fucking place and graduate. I hate most of the people here and it just sucks... Please kill me... But I will be home in about a week and a half for spring break to see kelly because I miss her. I also get to go down and stay with the burg and cause some trouble in his bubble. It will be saweeeeet!

"event","I had an absolutely amazing week with Kelly! It was definitely the best week ever to come back from the few classes I actually went to and have kel there waiting for me... Well she flew out on valentines day and that was def neat. I wanted to do something when I picked her up that would be embarrassing for me because who wouldnt enjoy somethine like that, so I bought a bunch of balloons and brought them to the airport.. Ya you would think other people would have flowers and balloons since it was v-day, but nope I was the only asshole in the whole airport with anything like that and everyone was giving me looks and laughing at me. So I took a little v-day cliche and made it really cool haha.. Then I got kelly a swear bear that says ""Pussies are pink, balls are blue. I cant BEAR to be without you. I wanna fuck you all the time. Wont you be my valentine?"" when you squeeze it, and then I took her out to dinner. Someone left a ""Available Men of Color"" calender in her work and she gave it to me. It's being hung up in my room of course because I am always looking for availble men of color, so good thing they thought to make a beautiful calender of it! Then she saved up a ton of dollars from working and made me eat so well for the week. I couldnt have asked for anything more, it was the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. We got soooo much Denny's breakfest! We did a huge grocery shopping and we made the best dinners EVER.

I could go on forever about the whole week, but some of the funnest things was when kelly and I got chased around by raging mad down syndrome man when we visited NAU. Don't ever ask some random guy an intricate question who is filling ketchup, though he might appear to be a functioning member of society, he is nothing but raging mad down syndrome man... I got kelly rediculously drunk on thursday night and took her to a bar. I drank a whole bottle of my new fav alcohol called Rumple Minze (it just tastes like drinking scope or somethign else minty, but it is good because it is 100 proof and you dont taste the alcohol at all.. Just minty freshness) And anyways, kelly got rediculously drunk and said a bunch of funny stuff to my roomates... Then when we got to my condo she couldnt even move and as I carried her inside she dove for my flower pot and just continued to puke inside of it.. hahaha

Well I could type forever about it, but all that matters is that I had an absolutely amazing weekend with my kels and I love her so much. It was definitely a sad and horrible thing to bring her to the airport this morning, but I have so much to look foward to that there is no need to be sad: In just 4 days I fly out to colorado to meet up with Dave V himself, My bro, my mom, and my cousin melissa to spend a mad phat crazy week in Smallorado skiing hardcore!!!! Then in just 24 days I am coming back home for half of spring break and I will get to see kel. I want to spend a day or two down in Bean-town with Burg as well because I didnt get to hit up his school as much as I wanted to over winter break. So I am really looking foward to that too....

Anyways, it's back to actually going to school and being a good student for me... For just monday!!!!!!!! then smallorado!!"

"event","So my school is really starting to piss me off. The whole campus is lined with tents with fucking assholes yelling at me preaching to me what to believe. Whether it be religion, some new-age hippy ass philosophy, politics, or that I need to buy this new product. Well today I was walking and I saw a group of girls either in like the 8th or 9th grade and they were carrying these ASU plastic bags... I didnt think anything about it at first, and I am surprised I even noticed, but as I walked down the campus about 1000 feet there were a bunch of people handing out those bags and screaming ""FREE CONDOMS AND FREE LUBE!"" It really fucking made me want to throw up all over them. Freed comdoms, ya whatever, but some old scary lady screaming at me to take free lube and just realizing that she handed out to the little 8th grade girls just made me want to die. I mean, I am not against handing out that shit and stuff, but what the fuck.. when I am walking to class I dont want to fucking have to deal with that. I dont want some fucking hippy yelling at me telling me I need to practice this new fucking Mid-Eastern quazi-religion. The ONLY tents set up that dont yell at people and preach to people is the ""Republican Student Union"" and ""Jewish Student Union"" Hmmm go figure, the only two groups that dont want to preach to people because they dont want fucking morons joining them. That's proof right there.

So speaking of my education being disrupted, I've noticed that whenever I go to my lectures I always pick the seat next to the two piece of shit sluts who have to talk to each other the whole class. It's really starting to get to me, I think I am going to snap and pack my backpack full of fertilizer and diesel fuel only to light myself on fire if they dont shut the fuck up....

Oh a happier note, Kelly will be out here tomorrow. I am sooooo mad ph@ excited. I've spent a good 3 hours cleaning, and there is soooo much more to do! Ohhhhh man I cant wait!!

well.. more to write about later... yep ok

I just thought it was funny because I know that girls love to kick guys when they're down, and Hannah is Dave's little sis, which is just silly

Well at least kelly is coming out to visit in a week... even though she too started laughing at me and making fun of me. Thanks hun, I love you....

Thats how I feel right now... Ya, fucking sweet huh? Note the sarcasm

but on the plus side... I will tell you my incredibly kick ass story about my mad dope ass lab I had today that definitely made my noggin' super duper smiley

So today in my general bio lab we got to play with DNA and do very simple DNA fingerprinting.. So basically we got to use enzymes to split up this very simple genetic material from bacteria called plastids and use electrolysis to map it... so ya that was cool I guess.. and even though it might sound lame to some of you other science folks, eat a dick because before this I did the most boring fucking waste of time bullshit.. so let me feel cool for a second

but so the really cool part... my lab TA is really cool and funny.. however today he was being really weird.. for example.. some girl was asking him a question and he just stared up into space paused then said ""Woah man I just had this crazy vibe there, don't ruin it for me! YOU JUST RUINED IT""... I was laughing but refused to believe he was messed up because he is really smart and stuff and was still functioning fine... ... so then he was drawing a plus sign on the bored and he was taking forever to do it and made it really big, then he just stared at it for 30 seconds and finally said ""woah man, that is totally FREAKING me out!""... fucking awesome... then he was relating some type of genetic material to acrillo.. pauses... then says ""You know Acrillo, sort of like what crack heads use to smoke their crack. You see you put it in your crack pipe and it keeps the crack in place when it melts""... HAHAHAHHAA... then to top it off, someone's cell phone rings and they had this kinda cool ring, and he says ""Woah man, that was like totally spacey! can you make it do it again?""

haha so happy I got the awesome TA.. sure did make my day

anyways

-My picture getting posted all over the internet with me in my stolen chuck e. cheese head smoking out of a hookah
-Having to buy almost an 1/8th a day when we had our first hookah
-On prom night burg and I smoked all the joints, and then like 2 hours later when we were really craving one Burg randomly found a joint in his cig box and we have no fucking idea how it got there. it WAS magic
-Clam baking the woods
-Blowing like 30 hits into a trashbag and putting it over the dog's head... then putting it over our own heads
-Making our own homemade gasmask bong and getting totally wrecked
-Cops searched my car but they couldnt find the bag of weed hidden under my seat because my car was too messy, and they were fucking pissed because they knew it was in there
-This nug is sooooooooo suck
-Getting so high that we all had altitude sickness
-Getting the HUGE strips of Filet Mingon at my work and then eating rediculous amount of expensive steak after smoking
-Smoking with the crazy 50 year old dudes when we were camping
-Rolling so many joints that we used to find random ones hidden through out the house because we lost track of some. Nevermind just finding like a little bud here and there, we actually found whole joints we somehow forgot about and lost, quite often too

So many good times.. If you remember any others I forgot, please reply with them. There were so many crazy things we did I forget them all

But spring semester is when all the freaks come out, I swear. You have the Albino Limp Man. No more needs to be said, he just limps all over campus and he is sooooo Albino..

Since it has been a while, I acted as if it was the first time I have ever done that bad stuff, you know how you make like a complete fool out of yourself and say stupid shit and light cigarrettes backwards. But it was cool because even though I had no control over what I did, I still noticed I was being a complete moron and I could laugh at myself... Like for instance, I went to a really ghetto convenient store at 3 in the morning. And because it is in the ghettos, they lock the doors and get you your shit through like this bank teller type contraption. And I guess I asked the guy what kind of gum they had and he flipped out on me and called me a fucking piece of shit druggy and that he was going to fucking kill me.. So I replied ""Ok nevermind, I'll take wintergreen"". You had to be there, it was quite the scene... Then I met my friend Ryan's girlfriend person or whatever status they might have, and she was a really cool chica. It made me incredibly happy to meet someone else so cool here because it's been a while. Anyhow, her name is Jodi and hopefully we'll party with her a lot because it's nice to know that there are actually other cool people here...

So I gots my bike for x-mas and I decided to ride to this cool place like 4 miles north of my house... So I had fun in the trails and then I got really lost and came out at the totally wrong place and was about 7 miles north of my house.. so I start to ride back home, and what happens? My fucking tire pops! Not really that big of a deal, except I decided not to bring any flat fixing stuff, my cell phone, or any money because it was just a short little ride... Now in any normal place in Phoenix I could find a pay phone no problem.. But fucking no!! I am in the midding of fucking nowhere so I had to walk my bike 3 miles through some ghetto to a hotel.. Oh yes, people were yelling at me and trying to hit me with their cars. Fucking sweet! So I get to the payphone and no one wanted to pick up a collect call to help me out. Sweet thanks guys!! So I got a cab and the guy just bitched at me the whole time for trying to bring a bike.. Lovely

All my friends and everyone who I think is really cool played competitive sports when they were under 12 but quit after that. Then I thought about all the kids who played competitive sports seriously when they are older than 12, and I realized that 90% of them are fucking losers. So I would like to argue that it is a horrible thing to do to let your kids who are older than 12 play competitive sports. You are just going to turn into an ass raping piece of shit asshole.

Ok so there is this really gay new fad thing out that kinda goes hand in hand with glowstick fags. It's like this 3 foot rope and there is a ball at the end that usually glows in the dark, and you hold two of them and swing them around like a little bitch. Ya well usually this incredibly gay task is performed at a really gay club.. However today some kid thought it would be cool to walk around school, class to class doing this. Ya, 40,000 students attend my school about. There are a fucking lot of people walking to their classes. I really just wanted to know what made this kid think this was an appropriate time to swing around balls on ropes. But the thing that really astonishes me, is why the fuck someone didnt beat the shit out of this kid. I have never seen something so rude and obsurd since Dave Van Ham....

Ya so Phantom Planet is playing a free show at my school and I am really excited. Well actually, I couldn't care less for the music really, but the drummer is so fucking cool. In fact, he is Cool Ethan, from the movie Slackers, which was fucking awesome. Same with Rushmore... ""These are OR scrubs"" ""Oh, Are they?"" ahahahaha. I wonder if he'll be mad when I make him reciet my favorite lines from the movies he's in. I cant fucking wait.

Lets see, what else is interesting... Paul Oakenfold this weekend. It's gonna be cool because I gots some really dope ass izzle banizzle Molly, and some phly digity kat tranq, and maybe picking up some mad ph@ whip cream gas if you know what I'm sayin yo. I cant wait.. I got my mountain bike and I almost died sooo many times today. Not cool to ride on the streets of phoenix to get to trails. I swear, the fucking cars try to hit me on purpose because they think it is funny.

22 more days until kelly visits me!"

"event","I was really excited to start school today... but then once I went to my first class I finally realized how bad it sucked and blahhh. I hate everyone and I hate being around so many people. My schedule fucking sucks. I hate it when I have classes all in a row because my campus is huge and it is impossible to get to some classes on time. Not only that, but one of my classes right in the middle is in this new building that they felt putting like 1 mile North of the campus... so life just really fucking sucks right now

I hate everyone

"event","Ahhhh.. I just finally flew in. My first flight was delayed and I thought I was going to be stuck in washington dc... but luckily I made my connection in time. The flight was rough. I am really sick. My nose did not stop running to whole time and it was like a fucking faucet. Then I missed kelly.. my mom.. and all my friends I left behind. It wasnt fun. Thank god I actually started reading an amazing book (a confederacy of dunces) thanks to dave. 

James picked me up from the airport and he was being really cool. So I am excited. It is definitely a good thing to get along well with your roomate. I start school on monday which will be exciting, but this semester is going to be incredibly hard. I am missing a whole week of school to go skiing and the week before that kelly will be here, so I am going to really have to work hard this semester to make up for that. That's not a bad thing though, I am incredibly excited.. this semester is going to rule!

It's going to be really hard going from seeing kelly everyday to not seeing her at all. I need to keep myself busy so I am happy, I am sure she doesnt want me upset. SO I cant wait for my bike to get shipped out here and for school to start.

alright.. time to sleep so I can party tomorrow
peace out homeslices"

"event","Today was rediculous. I have been all excited that I never came down with this flu everyone has been complaining about, and of course in my last couple days home I get it. So to top that off, today a pipe bursted for the pressurized hot water system of my house's heat furnace. It took my mom forever to find a plumber who would fix it today and he still didnt come until 9 tonight. So that really sucked. 

Anyways, I leave wednesday so if you want to stop by on tuesday (tomorrow) that would be neat. Also if anyone wants to go out to breakfest or lunch or something on wednesday, let me know.. My plane leaves at like 2:something I think. 

Kelly - It has been an amazing month and I love you sooooo much. I couldnt be any happier with how well everything went. I am going to miss you so much!!...

Since I am sad about leaving I'll think about all the things I get to look foward to: I get to see Kelly in just a month when she comes out to visit me for a week starting on valentines day!!!! The week after that I am going to breckenridge colorado for a week to ski with dave and my fam! I got a mountain bike on ebay for x-mas and I just found out my condo in AZ is just a 2 mile ride away in each direction from 2 of the best parks in AZ for singletrack. David Cross has a stand up show at the end of the month I really want to try and make it to. I guess the lead singer of Jane's Addiction is also a DJ and he is spinning later in the month. And school starts next monday which is always fun when it just starts... then sucks really bad...

Well peace out L-town... see you for a brief time for kelly's prom, and then for a couple months in the summa yo... Werrrrrrd"

"event","This is my tribute to the biggest asshole in the whole entire world: Dave Thomas Van Ham VIII

And this is why

Dave flirts with 10 year old boys

Dave gets a giant erection when he sees the backside of a horse or cow (sometimes it lasts for days)

Dave is not unlike a monkey because I always find him shitting into his hands and throwing his feces at innocent bystanders... And then he is infatuated with smelling his fingers for hours

When Dave isnt flirting with 10 year old boys, he is picking up 8 year old girls at the movie theater

Dave always tries to stick his fingers up his friend's asses after he discovered the pleasures of shitting into his own hands

Dave is addicted to drinking bleach

I always find Dave hanging out at the local kindergarten

Hahahahaha sucks to be everyone back home with your sweet 'up to 30inch' snowstorm in early december. All fun and games for right now, but just think about how much snow you are going to be stuck in if you had this big of a storm already in december.

"event","Ya so I didnt get to write about something really cool a couple weeks ago and there is nothing cool going on right now, so I figured I would write about it... Well anyways.. A while back I got this flyer for some party thing with two huge DJs spinning (Dave Aude and AK1200) and I figured it would be the same old type of thing that none of you are really interested in.. Well anyways.. the flyer didnt say anything about where it was except that it was in Tuscon. I couldnt find anything about it on the internet except on the DJ's website that they were spinning in an undisclosed location.. Finally on the day of it, we found a post online that gave a couple phone numbers to call for directions. So at this point I am thinking this might be pretty fucking cool because that is pretty underground. So Gabe (who was in Arizona on business call), James and I drove down. We found the place and it was in sort of an abandoned chinese restaraunt. We found out that the people who were promiting it were the same guys who used to hold the huge dessert raves you have probably seen on the news of MTV.. They havent been able to hold the dessert raves lately because the last one they had some guys with shotguns came out from the dessert and robbed them for the $500,000 they made off of it haha. Well anyways, this place was fucking awesome. They had a stage set up outside and 2 other inside. EVERYONE was super fucked up. Kids rolling around on the ground having no idea what was going on. The crowd there was awesome. Everyone was there from gay kids to hardcore punks. Everyone got along and it wasnt the stuck up pretty boy croud you think about when you think techno. It was so awesome. I found drugs instantly.. I decided to do some little round happy things for old times sake and they were the best by far I have ever done other than pure mdma. I didnt think it was possible to get good stuff off of some random kid at a thing like this... Well anyways, a police helicopter found the place and was circling over with a spotlight for like 15 mins.. and then another 15 mins later the whole thing got busted and closed down. It was an actual illegal party, or rave. It was soooo cool. I dont care if you absolutely hate electronic music and you think it is the gayest thing ever, you would have still thought it was awesome. I know this because there were a lot of hardcore punks there who obviously didnt like the music but you could still tell they were having fun and when it got broken up they were pissed... 
Anyways I just thought it was pretty cool and I had fun"

I was looking at the map and I noticed just north of Tuscon was the ""Biosphere 2""... Now, being the HUGE Pauly Shore fan I am, I knew that in the movie bio-dome, the dome was just north of Tuscon arizona... So of course I had to stop by.. I was soooo fucking excited... but we got there and it wasnt the same bio-dome as the one in the movie.. I looked it up online later and the exterior of the bio-dome in the movie was actually filmed at some Japanese garden near LA... Then I also saw the only junior college in Tuscon (where bud and doyle went to school) only in bio-dome it was ""Thunderbird College"" and in real life it is Pima Community College... So I got the whole bio-dome arizona tour but all of the ""inspirational"" locations werent anything more than inspirations... Oh well... At least I got to see the real bio-dome even though it sucked big giant ass"

"event","well I havent updated in forever because I havent had a computer to work until now.. so I thought I would write what has been going on for anyone who might care... Well first I moved into my new place a week and a half ago. It was hell and nothing went right. Our U-Haul broke down a bunch of times and everything broke when we moved it... the house really isnt set up yet because everything is still broken, including cable in every room except one... but when my mom comes out here for thanksgiving I should get everything fixed up and I will take some pics, because other than everything breaking, my new condo is mad ph@....

Lets see.. This weekend I went to see Natalie Lane Varner in good ol' Kansas. It was really really good to hang out with Natalie because I havent seen her since last thanksgiving and she is like my sister. I am so glad I got to hang out with her for a couple days and forget about the shit that has been going on back here in Arizona. 

After the shit I am gonna have to go through these next couple days, it is going to be mad ph@ hopefully... First, Gabe (Doober's friend from the air force) is coming out to phoenix on business call and he called James and I and asked us to show him a good time. So that is going to be mad rad because Gabe is the bee's knees. There is a Rave down in Tuscon (an hour and a half south of here) and I am pretty excited because I think it is going to be a real rave and I have never been to one before. I hope so because I havent done a lot of chemicals recently and I think it would be a good oppurtunity to do so.

Then on monday my mom and bro fly out here for a week for spanksgiving. So that will be neato because my mom and bro are cool shiznit.

And exactly a month from tomorrow I will be back in L-town for winter break which is going to be awesome!! I cant wait, this winter is going to be fun."

I thought cops would be smart about under cover officers at clubs to bust people for drugs, but this was their sad attempt.. There were these 2 guys who were at least 50 years old. They were sporting their magnetic clip of piercings. They had their shirts off with a wife beater tucked into their pockets. They were holding and empty water bottle, I mean come on now, at least put the effort into holding a water bottle with some water in it. And then to top it all off they were wearing identical fanny packs with glow stick shit hanging off them. They took all the stereotypical E-tard attire and just mixed it all together. What a fucking joke, could it have been anymore of a giveaway. I mean they didnt look the least bit fucked up, and they just followed people around who were talking about drugs and how fucked up they were.. And the best is when they heard someone talking about drugs they would go and hide in some corner and break out their walkie talkies from their fanny packs like they were all tricky... I mean come on, this is the Phoenix valley here and we are supposed to have the worst drug problem in the country so you think the cops would be smart here about that kinda stuff... just goes to show you that they will never win the war on drugs because they are fucking retards. I mean fuck, the drug users are smarter than the cops..

Oh yes, I was wonder woman for halloween and went to a bunch of parties... everyone loved it until this one tall guy just looks at me and calls me a fag... Well this doesnt blow over well when you are with 5 other of your buddies who are all really big and like to fight... So the dude got his ass kicked.. And for calling me a fag I ran up to him and just started kicking him in the face.. I only wonder what the other 200 people at this huge party thought watching me dressed up like wonder woman kicking some guy in the head and my other friends are beating the shit out of him...

"event","So I heard the most rediculous thing ever today in my physics class... there were 2 kids behind me and all of a sudden one whispered really really quietly and nervously ""What is the drug crystal meth?"".. I think it was because his roomate is a druggy and he didnt know anything about anything... so his equally ignorant friend said ""It is an upper. You do it once and you are imediately addicted. It makes you stay up for 4 days straight and you cant shit or piss for a whole week because you cant eat or drink""... I mean fuck, I wont say that meth is a good drug and that people dont do bad things on it, but it is nothing like that. I wanted to tell him how it was.. and that I have tried it a few times, never got addicted. It only lasts a couple hours and you have to keep on doing more to stay up for days at a time.. and if you didnt eat, drink, shit or piss in 4 days then you would die.. it just made me really mad because he was the type of person who makes drug laws and says whoever does drugs is a horrible person... whatever

but then I realized that people in my physics class suck, and this is why: We have this stupid remote answering thing in the class where we take little quizes every class and it will say your last name in a box on this huge projection screen when you answer.. And somebody has the last name ""Strcka"" Hey what the fuck? is that kid against vowels or something? fucking piece of shit.. and I know it wasnt abbreviated because the teacher just cuts off the last letter instead of getting rid of vowels like this fucking clown shoe.. and then someone else has the last name ""Snoddgrass""... what the fuck is that? he should just shoot himself in the fucking head.. Simple as that

Then in my history class there is this fucking piece of shit my roomate and I call Pancho Viaz.. You all know I hate old people who go to college.. well this fucking loser is real old, like 50 or 60 something maybe.. And this is history 110.. a freshman or sophmore course.. nothing Pancho should be in.. And I swear he acts more immature than anyone else in the class... like one day some kid was late and was walking with his GF and kissed her so the teacher made fun of him.. and when he came in, Panch fucking ran over to him, Bitch tits shaking and all, and then started making fun of him like an 8th grader.. it was really disturbing... And well if you didnt get it by the name pancho, he is mexican.. and he always talks about how we should practice reverse descrimination in the class.. mother fucker, he bitches constantly about how his people are oppressed, but then he wants to reverse it and do it to others.. Fucking piece of shit.. He doesnt know anything. My people were fucking rounded up, tortured and brutily murdered. 1/3 of us in the whole world were killed. And you dont ever see any jews bitching and whining about it other than about how horrible it was.. I mean fuck, we dont expect anything out of it and bitch about how life is so unfair to us... Shit everyone makes Jew jokes and we all just take it because we know we are going to make more money than you

"event","Today was the worst day ever... Ok well first of all I have been extremely sick/dead because my dad brought over that evil NH sickness I made fun of all of you for having.. so I guess I got what I deserved... and then last night I destroyed my right leg and it has been extremely sore and painful to walk on today...
So I got up and my mouth was extremely dry and I was all dehydrated. I've actually never been in this much pain before from being dehydrated, but it was fucking torture. So I went to the fridge and there was only beer. Which only would make you more dehydrated in the morning unless your name is Dave Van Ham. Then there was no ice in the freezer and it if you drink my water straight from the tap without ice it makes you throw up. Trust me, it works everytime. So I just started to get ready because I was going to leave early and get something to drink. I realized that I left my backpack in the gym the other night and I needed it really bad for my calculator and physics book because I had a quiz. Then I totally lost my only hat. I have to wear something on my head because when I take my bike to school my hair will stand straight up and never come back down.. So I only have winter hats which not only makes me look like an idiot, but it extremely painful when it is 100degrees outside... Finally I get ready and go out to my bike to leave, but I left in the key overnight because I am an idiot and the battery was dead. So I had to wake up my roomate and ask to borrow his car... When I got to school I realized that I could have done my hair because I took a car, but I forgot and was still wearign a winter hat... Fucking sucks.. then I had to park the car in the lot that was on the complete otherside of campus as my class and I got to walk 1 mile each way to class limping in great agony the whole time......... So I get back from class and try to jump my bike... I had to jump it a total of 5 times because the motor kept on stahling out and it didnt have enough juice yet to start it back up.. and it is a huge fucking pain in the ass to jump a bike... then I finally get it going and drive it for 15 minutes before I realize that my alternator doesnt work and my battery wasnt charging.. so that is going to cost me a sweet $400 I dont have and looks like I am missing the rest of my classes today... fucking blows

But one really good thing happened today. James and I got our new condo and it is pretty sweet. It has a huge tile living room with a fireplace (which is actually nice in the winter here because it gets cold enough that it would be nice to use one and not waste money on heating the house with electricity). Then the upstairs splits into a bathroom, big bedroom and decent sized loft... Downstairs is the other bedroom about the same size but with a really nice bathroom attached and walk in closet, not that I care for that but it is a place for storage.. Then the kitchen is really nice and there is a huge laundry room which is fucking awesome for college students who just like to throw their clothes on the ground. But see the deal is that we have an extra loft that could be turned into a nice bedroom.. So you should move out here and live with me and rent will be extremely cheap if three of us split this place... right on

I am going skydiving next week!! It is pretty cool, the first jump is $90 and it is that gay tandem thing BUT it is only $50 after that and you get to jump solo! Sooo cool.. hopefully I dont die because that would suck.

Umm I kinda want to transfer. I like AZ and all but I think I want to go to California and at a school where I can get a more applicable major but still a derivative of biology. I am not going to be able to transfer for a year though, but if anyone is interested in living in california with me, let me know because I am going to need a roomate...

I havent gone out much at all lately because I think the people who go to bars/clubs really really suck at life.. But Paul Van Dyk is spinning November first so I am going to have to suck it up and go see him because he is the best.

Halloween and my birthday are coming up and that should be rad. 

When I come home for winter break I am staying up at a condo near loon for like 3 weeks. Anyone is welcome to come up and stay and go skiing/snowboarding with me or whatever.. even if you dont I am going to throw 1 or 2 big parties and it will be fun because it is up in the mountains. So let me know if you are down for going up haha

"event","So yesterday my roomates and I decided to stop by goodwill to see what they had... When I first walked in my eyes were immediately drawn to these two beautiful retro orange recliner chairs. They were absolutely amazing, it was love at first site. When I sat down in them it was even more amazing.. soooo comfortable.. So naturally I looked at the price tag just incase... They were $2.99 each ""Managars Especiall"" as the tag read haha.. I couldnt believe that 1. they were that cheap even for goodwill standards and 2. no one bought them yet... so I asked the clerk to help me out.. After about a half hour of phone calls and calling managers over, I'm not kidding, they determined that not only were the chairs $2.99 each, but they were 50% off. So of course I bought them, 2 fucking amazing recliners for a wopping total of $2.99... But the most classic thing happened ever.. I couldnt pick them up for a couple days so they had to move them to the back of the store.. And as we were leaving the guy was trying to move the chair and the whole back piece fell right off and the little spanish guy looked so afraid, and we all started cracking up because he didnt realize that they were our chairs because he thought he was in the clear. It was just beautiful, buying two chairs for $2.99 and watching the goodwill dude break one of them...

Yesterday I went to an underground hip hop show with joel. Atmosphere was the headliner but there were like 15 groups there. It was pretty cool.. they all sounded really good, unlike 50cent and Ludacris shit that sounds fucking horrible on a CD, nevermind live. This one group called the Odd Jobs was pretty fucking cool and had an Asian rapper and some other kid who reminded me of the beastie boys but much better. The funny part was that the only groups I really liked were all white... except for Z-Man who was this rasta dude who only rapped about exstasy and the man bringing him down. it was funny shit though... Atmosphere's DJ came out first and was probably the best turntablist I have ever heard. It was amazing. He also spun Rage Against the Machine - Killing in the name of and scratched to it which would have been possibly the coolest thing I have ever heard except the sound quality sucked because it was so bass heavy from the ""phat hip hop beats"" yo. It was cool to finally go to a smaller club show, and underground hip hop is pretty good too... In November I get to see Alkaline Trio with Reggie and the full Effect which should be cool.

I get to move in the end of october or begining of november so I am pretty excited.. except it is kind of stressful because it takes a lot of money to move into a new place.. money that I dont have and wont have, but I will figure something out. I think I am moving into these condos near my school that are full of kids and have parties all the time, so it should be cool. 

lets see what else... Nothing else really cool going on, I thought I would just update for the fuck of it... Happy 18th Birthday Kelly... to everyone else, peace to your mama's crease yo"

"event","I had an awefully silly night tonight so I think I should write about it... 

So first there was a huge party forming on this road off of my road.. so my roomates and I thought we should check it out since they are kind of our neighbores... So by the time we get there it is MASSIVE. Not like anything I have ever seen before. There were at least 400 people packed into this small little house and backyard. So we were hanging out, and some group of nasty girls just decided to be bitches to my roomate Steve for no reason. I think it started by one of the girls stepped on his foot and said sorry.. then he said ""It's ok"" really nicely and the girl said in ""Uhhhh, I wasnt talking to YOU!!""... and Steve kept his mouth shut surprisingly. So he was like whatever.. then like 5 minutes later the girls just started kicking shit at us because they needed attention or something.. So then steve went off and started asking if the girl was pregnant and started with the fat jokes... So one of the girls went to poor her beer on steve's head but he deflected it and it went all over her. Then there was some yelling and they turned around and started to walk away. And then to finish it off steve poured his beer right on the girls head as she turned around. It was fucking beatiful. 

Alright well I met this girl in my english class today who seemed pretty cool I guess but I had a strange feeling about her. Anyways, sometimes I get this weird sixth sense when I meet new people that I will see them. So I knew I would see her when I went out tonight. I didnt see her at the first party and I was a little upset that my sense failed for the first time ever. So then I went to these apartments right off of campus that are always crazy packed with parties. We opened the door to some party in one of the apts. Low and behold, the first thing I see is this girl on top of a table stripping and dancing all crazy. She was rediculously drunk so she either didnt notice me or didnt really care to acknoledge my existence. Either way I will have to remind her of her performance in class on monday...

Then some kid randomly decided to push one of my roomates because he was all drunk and that was almost a fight.. then it turns out he was gay and started hitting on another one of my roomates...

So then we get to a frat where we know a kid. And the almighty president came out and started acting wicked rude to us and being stupid. So he went inside and all of a sudden litterally 35-40 kids walked out obviously to fight my three roomates and I. I am glad it takes 35-40 kids to fight all 4 of us when we didnt even raise our voices or do anything to provoke a fight. We just wanted to talk to our friend in the frat for fucks sake.

Then we got drunk and tried breaking some windows of the first party we went to but I dont feel like typing anymore...

I guess my point is that everyone is supposed to be laid back here, but it isnt true. There are so many assholes here it makes me sick. I hate people."

"event","So today was a pretty silly day... At 2 oclock this afternoon my roomate, steve, and I thought it would be a good idea to drink a few beers... So we just kinda randomly did to start our day off.. Now steve doesnt ever do drugs but I have these really cool muscle relaxent pills from mexico called Soma's which arent very bad for you (you need a prescription to buy them here but they arent scheduled so the cops can only take them away, no trouble).. so we randomly decided we might as well eat a bunch... So I got pretty fuzzed up.. then Steve wanted to dip, which is the tobacco that you put behind your lip or whatever and it really messes you up... This was a dangerous thing for me to do because last time i did it after I drank I threw up and I said some very dumb things I still get made fun of for to this day... But I didnt drink that much so I thought I would be ok.. .. so when all was said and done, I got a little too fuzzed and I went to my room to pass out... and then I got too messed up to leave.. and i knew I was going to throw up but I wouldnt make it to the bathroom... But this was ok because I thought I could find something to throw up into and my roomates wouldnt know so they wouldnt bring up what happened last time... and I didnt want to look like a pussy... ... well I couldnt find anything to throw up into, so I just used my blanket figuring I could wash it or something... ... well as soon as I started puking, my door (which I thought was locked) just happens to fly open and it is one of my roomates... I looked at him and he knew I was trying to think of some sort of lie to explain what I was doing (dont ask me how I come up with a lie that would explain I wasnt throwing up even though food was coming up out of my mouth).. So when I realized I am an idiot and there is no lie, I was actually kind of proud and thought it was cool... There was no need to be embarrassed about getting sick. I rule!... Now dont you all feel a lot smarter reading this story?? I thought so"

"event","Kelly left this morning from visiting me out in arizona. I hope she had somewhat of a good time. There wasnt really much to do because usually I just sleep all day and whenever I do something there is some sort of age restriction and kelly is almost 17, but almost doesnt count as 18. It was good to just hang out though. And she is obviously a way better friend than you because she is the first and only friend to come out here and visit me! No it's ok, I know it takes time and money and I am an asshole for being on the other side of the country. 
School starts a week from today. I am a little bit scared because I dont have a working vehicle at the moment and I should probably do something about that. But even if I do, there is litterally no gas in the state of Arizona. A main gasline broke and only about 1 out of every 15 gas stations have gas. And the line of cars is about 2 blocks long. It's also cool that the price of gas doubled... Looks like I am skateboarding to school for the first week in the sweet 105-110 degree weather. Fucking awesome!

"event","I had an insanely fun night tonight so I figured I would update my journal and talk about it... Well they had a girl dj night at the stupid trendy cool person club I always go to... but it was an awesome scene, no stupid hip hop assholes. The first dj to spin was this local girl who was absolutely amazing. She looked a lot like Samantha Hutchins I thought and that was pretty cool. Anyways, two of her friends kept on hitting on James and I and kept on talking about how we were the cutes and coolest people there. Even though I didnt appreciate being hit on by them, it was quite an honor. Then when their dj friend finished her set they all came up to us and asked us to borrow some keys so they could snort drugs in the bathroom.. It was pretty silly that the dj snorted coke from james' keys. Then Dj Mea spun. She was absolutely amazing, you should check out her stuff. I couldnt have been more happy because she spins my favorite kind of techno, progressive nuschool breakbeats, even though that is probably jibberish to most of you. But I promise it is cool. And not only was it cool because not many Djs spin that, but she was a girl. Sooo cool. I had a blast. So then Steph was there and James and her got along which made me pretty happy I guess because I hate being in the middle of things. Then steph got us into this new afterhours club for free which was pretty neato. I had a good time there.. Except dumbass steph was really drunk and wouldnt leave me alone. She kept on trying to kiss me, uh oh! But I told her what was up and got her to leave me alone. It was pretty cool though because I got to make fun of her a lot and it made me feel a lot better about myself. At least she is good for that, because she accepts me making fun of her because she knows it is all true and that I rule. So I had a very good night and I have many cool things to look foward to:
Dave Matthews Band next thursday
Scott Henry and Dj Feelgood is a week
Jenna Jameson porno party the day after that
Dj Rap and Dj Keoki spinning in august
Kelly coming out to visit me in a month

"event","Before I start, first off I would like to say FUCK YOU and thanks for all the pain you've caused me. You are the reason why I am so angry... Now that I got that off my chest, this is what you can do about it!! Not only will you put a halt to my suffering by killing yourself, you will do some serious psychological damage to a bunch of other assholes that piss me off!
OK so here is what you need:
-Rope. Very long
-Wire. Should be a thin guage but can hold at least 5000 pounds, this fucker cant break. Long!
- Industrial glue. this shit should be strong as hell. Dont fuck around with elmers, get the hardcore shit
- A tall building over a crowded street. Preferable a 10+ story high college dorm/building

OK so here is what you do: You need to figure out how high the building is, dont half ass this like you half ass life. This is your one chance to do some good so dont fuck around make sure you know how high the damn building is. Cut the wire 50 feet shorter than the building and then cut the rope 25 feet shorter. Now tie off the rope and the wire to something very very sturdy ontop of the roof. IT CANT BREAK. Dont fuck this up now that you've gone this far. You need to use good strong knots. You can look this up on the internet or I will be more than happy to teach you some strong ass ones. Hell, I will even tie them for you if you are that retarded. Ok so next you tie the wire around your neck and the rope around you legs. Dont mix that up you salad fucker, it is important! Next, glue your hand to your head. Use shitloads of glue and give it some time to dry. Finally, jump off the side of the building!!!! 
Ok so for you idiots who cant visualize what will happen, let me explain. When you jump, first the wire will catch because it was cut 25 feet shorter than the rope. It will cut your head clean off since the wire is wont give and is a small guage. Your head will be glued to your hand though so you will still be holding onto your decapitated head. Then the wire will catch and you will hang upside down holding your head, pouring out blood onto a crowded street! Everyone will see! Little fragile-minded children will have serious head problems for the rest of their lives. Innocence will be lost, and I will be there laughing my fucking ass off! Dooooooo it!!!!!!! And make sure you give let me know when you do it so I can watch, dont worry I definitely wont try to talk you down from it like your other pussy friends."

"event","I fucking hate the Osbourne Show with a passion. Kelly is just a raging, beligerant brat. It amazes me how much more of a brat she must be when the camera isnt on. Whoever actually enjoys watching her just has sick problems. Jack just represents all that is pathetic and wrong with human nature. This kid has probably the sweetest life out of any kid in the whole entire world. He can do whatever the hell he wants, litterally. He has all the money in the world, and no rules at all set forth by his parents. SO what does he do? Well last week I saw a commercial for his ""Post Rehab"" show. What a loser. Congrads on going to rehab you fucking loser and then announcing on your sweet ass TV show as some sort of marketing ploy. Does he want sympathy or something? No one should give him shit, he has the sweetest life ever... Oh and then I just saw a commercial for his ""coming out and admitting he is brutally suicidal"" show. What the fuck? If Jack Osbourne is suicidal then it just proves that it is impossible to be happy in this world. He is the ugliest kid ever, and yet he could get any girl he ever wanted just because of who his father is. He has all the money in the world, so he can do whatever he wants. He can go to any school in the whole world. Fuck, if he wanted to be a famous musician, or in movies he could just because of his fathers name. His whole life is handed to him and he can do ANYTHING. You might argue that maybe he is depressed because he cant make his own name for himself and nothing is really a challenge to him... But that's bullshit. I've never been upset to take a shortcut or have something handed to me. I mean, say he wanted to be a drummer in a band. His dad would just get the best drummers in the world to teach him and he would be pretty good. He is still working for his goals, but he just has the best resources ever and will never be let down. So that argument is bunk. Fuck dude, he has no reason to ever be depressed. And drugs? I have no sympathy for anyone who does drugs out of depression and then tries pinning it on that. So he can go fuck himself... he is obviously a waste of a human being. Ozzy is a fucking loser too. I dont find anything about his stupidity interesting. It's boring and fake if you ask me. Another marketing ploy for their gay ass reality show... The only decent person is the mother. But she obviously brought up shitty children reguardless. So she should be shot. 

Someone thought of the great idea of television because reality is boring... So why make reality shows then? They all suck and make my head hurt... fuck you"

I've been stuck in the middle my whole life, I can handle it. I had to go through my parents brutal divorce when I was 12, nothing can compare to that, and I survived. The only thing that sucks about being in the middle is that while you have to make both sides happy, you also have to fuck over both sides in order to do so. It's the worst feeling in the world... time to pass out"

"event","So the flight home yesterday fucking sucked. I'll be a bitch and admit that for the time I was actually I awake I was balling my eyes out. I really hope I didnt hurt anyone by wanting to come back early. I have been really afraid that my friends think that I am betraying them or running away from them, but that is definitely not the case. All I can say is that I think that being in arizona for right now is best for me. I promise I'll be back for a week though sometime in august.

Alright well things definitely havent gotten any easier since I've been back but I think I just brought a lot of drama with me. First off I got the airport here and didnt have a ride because both of my roomate's cars were in the shop. So yes, I called steph and she came to pick me up with her boyfriend. It didnt upset me in the slightest bit however, so that was good. I am over her, but she is still a close friend which makes things difficult. Because james got really drunk last night and got into a fight with her, putting me right in the middle. He yelled at her and said she was just using me and then kept on screaming about how much of a slut she is. She is one of those girls who will never cry in front of everyone but she started balling her eyes out right there. She wanted to leave really bad but I had to calm her down because I wouldnt let her drive drunk and so upset. I felt like a piece of trash holding her back but she decided to stay and thanked me later for it and told me it was the right thing to do ... ... I am always in the middle of things. I hate it. I only fear what james is going to say about her when he wakes up. I wish I could be really pissed off but I know he is looking out for me, he just cant ever do it in a civil way. 

So yep, I am still a mess.

I am going to start applying for jobs today so I can do mindless work so I dont have to think about things.

I miss kelly, I wish she was here"

I decided to make my journal <B>FRIENDS ONLY</B>.  This is nothing personal or anything, it was just something that had to be done.

If you want to be added:
-comment

Some things you must know:
-I love my cat.  I take random pictures of her.  
-I take random pictures of anything.
-I work at Questar Gas.  I have Questar drama.  I talk about it.
-I don't have a boy but I have many I enjoy.  I ask for advice on those boys.
-I typo.  
-I post after drinking and usually tell people to call me.
-I love comments.
-I love the following and if you don't, you probably don't want to read: Brand New, The Golden Girls, Roswell, that one bass player, Saved By The Bell.  
If you have a problem with any of the above....you don't want to be here.

<B>Also...</B>if you want to add me, please comment here.  Don't just add me and never comment.  I don't mind you adding me first, but when I go to my info page and see that three people added me and didn't comment, it pisses me off.  It's common courtesy.  Just let me know.  I'm nice, I wont hurt you...unless...you don't comment.

I write a lot, and it's weird, obscure, and sometimes comes out making no sense at all.  I really, really, REALLY like feedback, good or bad, so if you feel so inclinded, please read and enjoy.  


I really am a nice person. But...you break-a my rules...I break-a your face.  Deal?

Peace~Jordan"

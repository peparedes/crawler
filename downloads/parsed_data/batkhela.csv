"event","An elderly woman walked into the Bank of Canada one morning with a purse full of money. She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.

After many lengthy discussions an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. 

The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, ""$165,000"". The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.

The president was surprised and asked, ""What kind of bets?""

The elderly woman replied, ""Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.""

The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, ""Would you like to take my bet?""

""Certainly"", replied the president. ""I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.""

""Done"", the elderly woman answered. ""But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.""

""No problem"", said the president of the Bank confidently.

That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.

The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square.

The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.

The president was happy to oblige.

The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. ""Of course"", said the president. ""Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.""

The elderly woman did so with a little smile.

Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall.

He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, ""Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10! o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Bank of Canada!"""

"event","A Panda Bear walks into a cafe and orders a sandwich and a drink. After he is finished eating, the waiter comes over to bring him the check. When the waiter arrives at the table, he just starts to ask 'Would you like any des...' Then the Panda Bear reaches into his fur, pulls out a gun, and shoots the waiter dead. The Panda Bear then wipes off his chin with his napkin, gets up, and starts to walk out. Just as he is about to go through the door, the manager grabs him. 'Wait a minute!' he yells, 'You just killed my best waiter! Besides that, you didn't even pay for your sandwich!' 

the Panda Bear grasps the manager by the throat, jacks him up, and growls, 'Hey man! I'm a PANDA! Do you know what that means? Why don't you look it up!' 

at this the Panda walks out the door and ambles down the street. 

the manager, shaken, returns to his office and consults a dictionary. He reads: 

'panda - a large mammal of the Asian mountain forests related to raccoons and true bears and characterized by bold black and white markings. Eats shoots and leaves.'"

"event","An eccentric philosophy professor gave a one question final exam after a semester dealing with a broad array of topics.

The class was already seated and ready to go when the professor picked up his chair, plopped it on his desk and wrote on the board: ""Using everything we have learned this semester, prove that this chair does not exist.""

Fingers flew, erasers erased, notebooks were filled in furious fashion. Some students wrote over 30 pages in one hour attempting to refute the existence of the chair. One member of the class however, was up and finished in less than a minute.

Weeks later when the grades were posted, the rest of the group wondered how he could have gotten an A when he had barely written anything at all.

His answer consisted of two words: ""What chair?"""

Two individuals proceeded towards the apex of a natural geologic

"event","The mother of a 17-year-old girl was concerned that her daughter was having sex. Worried the girl might become pregnant, and adversely impact the family's status, she consulted the family doctor. 

The doctor told her that teenagers today were very willful, and any attempt to stop the girl would probably result in rebellion. He then told her to arrange for her daughter to be put on birth control and, until then, talk to her and give her a box of condoms.

Later that evening, as her daughter was preparing for a date, the woman told her about the situation and handed her a box of condoms. The girl started to laugh and reached over to hug her mother saying, ""Oh Mum! You don't have to worry about that! I'm dating Susan!"""

"event","SLOW DANCE 

Have you ever watched kids 
On a merry-go-round? 
Or listened to the rain 
Slapping on the ground? 
Ever followed a butterfly's 
erratic flight? 
Or gazed at the sun into 
the fading night? 

You better slow down. 
Don't dance so fast.
Time is short.
The music won't last. 

Do you run through each day 
On the fly? 
When you ask How are you? 
Do you hear the reply? 
When the day is done 
Do you lie in your bed 
With the next hundred chores 
Running through your head? 

You'd better slow down 
Don't dance so fast. 
Time is short. 
The music won't last. 

Ever told your child, 
We'll do it tomorrow? 
And in your haste, 
Not see his sorrow? 
Ever lost touch, 
Let a good friendship die 
Cause you never had time 
To call and say,""Hi"" 

You'd better slow down. 
Don't dance so fast. 
Time is short. 
The music won't last . 

When you run so fast to get somewhere 
You miss half the fun of getting there. 
When you worry and hurry through your day, 
It is like an unopened gift.... Thrown away. 
Life is not a race. 
Do take it slower 
Hear the music 
Before the song is over."

"event","I would like to remind everyone that my new webcomic, Team Pocket, has premiered today. While the LiveJournal format is terribly clunky in retrospect, the good news is that my Comic Genesis account will be active soon and, I predict, I will be hosting the comic there in three weeks.

Please enjoy, and let me know what you think! Keep in mind that this comic is a bit of an experiment on my part, and, along with telling some ripping yarns, tall tales, and action adventures, it's also a celebration of the amateur comics of school years gone by, scrawled on notebook paper during science class, shared with your friends during lunch hour. It is this spirit of irreverent fun and self-awareness I hope to recapture in this god damn ridiculous comic.

"event","Early last week, as I was drawing something that had nothing to do with what I had drawn a few weeks ago, I decided that I needed to become a bit more focused. It wasn't quite enough that I was doing something everyday (I was in fact, it's just that some days produced showable content and others didn't and, you know what, I'm not going to show something terrible or something too far out of appreciable context just because,) so I decided that I'd better just blunder into starting a webcomic.

In about two weeks, on March 10th, Team Pocket goes LIVE.

I'm also doing the entire thing through the holy union of LiveJournal and Photobucket, mostly so I don't have to bother with coding and, y'know, paying anyone anything.

It is an action/adventure comic starring Team Pocket: Sir Small and the Incredible Corndog.

Add it to your friends!

I've been reading ""The Silmarillion"" this past week or so, and I'm actually pleased to say that I'm able to read it at this point. I've tried several times in the past but it always felt like a chore, or I was attempting some impossible task, like trying to taste the concept of a flower or trying to dance to Merzbow. I'm happy to report that not only do I love every single word of it (yeah, and that includes every F-named elf in the damn thing,) I might even put it above the Rings trilogy in satisfying quality. I don't know what it is this time, but now I finally get the Silmarillion.

I wouldn't call Tolkien a particularly descriptive writer, but I would say that he is an imaginative one and that if you do have enough imagination and have a good 'feel' for the epic, his epic speech really delivers some great moments. One of my favorite parts is the Cry of Morgoth, that signals his return to Middle-Earth as he is set upon by the terrifying and bloated Ungoliant. An army of Balrogs awake from deep within the earth and come to his aid, slicing away her webs, spun of Un-light, with their flaming swords.

This moment inspired today's SBS, and although it's little more than a character concept sketch, I enjoy it. Something I may have to revisit."

My favorite thing about Corndog: I can draw him however the hell I want to, but he's still got his basic bean-shape whenever things aren't being stupid. Nick Park constantly doodles Grommit, who's got a very curvy shape to his head, and he's remarked that he'll never get the perfect shape, but he never stops trying. Corndog and I are the same way, though when he was originally created he was almost rectangular and the expressions I gave him were never too out of the ordinary. I try to draw Corndog these days in the most absurd, sometimes offensive way possible. The basis of his character is that there is little rhyme or reason to his every little facet, and he needs to be drawn that way as well. Also, the butt is a new addition. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not.

Also, it's Hen Grenade."

This started out as a comic featuring The Incredible Corndog, but after the second frame was drawn (sometimes to get started on something I'll think up and write up nonsense for a first frame, then just go with it,) it HAD to be a SuperGuy! comic.

So. Here it is. The first SuperGuy! comic is seven years. I wasn't expecting it at all, wasn't expecting that my most dear comic creation would appear again out of nowhere, and I certainly wasn't expecting that I indeed felt like I was actually able to draw him again. I've tried, so many times over the years, to create more SuperGuy!, or maybe a better way of looking at it was that I wasn't inspired enough. Nothing worked for me, nothing fit, and now suddenly something does.

Going to have to approach this one with optimistic caution. Let's see what happens.

Edit: Also! I hope you enjoy my eraser marks and things that should be eraser marks. Like you needed a look at the shit that happens for before something happens to shit so it becomes passable shit. It feels like a SuperGuy! comic, freshly drawn, sitting in my binder at school, though. I used to do two of those in a day, holy crap."

Crest of a Knave by Jethro Tull. After the blues of the late 60's, the hard rock of the early 70's, the pastoral/minstral/hard rock fusion of the late 70's and the synth-laden albums of the early 80's, Jethro Tull somehow manages to combine them all into one album, which certainly deserved a Grammy (Perhaps not the one it received, however.) Clever lyrics and brilliant composition feature in every song, with subjects ranging from high-rise construction workers, to striking out terribly with a fascinating woman, the price of the modernization and sprawl of technology, to the soldier abroad, to vagabond travel, all done in an beautiful, bluesy rock style that sounds like everything and nothing they've done before. Certainly not the first album the Tull layman, or even expert, would pick as their best but it's my personal favorite. Songs From the Wood is a close second."

"event","Coiling Spine has been going well. I'm pleased with the quality of the characters I'm drawing, but now I'm starting to feel the effects of my lack of constant practice, which I'm not pleased with. During my five-year piss-off from drawing, I, at least, did a lot of thinking about it. Somehow I cultured and refined my ideas without actually practicing them, which probably shouldn't even work, but it seems to be.

An early notice: Once Coiling Spine wraps in a year or so, I will continue to draw a webcomic. It is an action/adventure/comedy that has its roots planted firmly in Disney's classic half-hour cartoons shows; the works of some of my major influences: Rob Schrab, Steve Purcell, Doug TenNapel, and Evan Dorkin; as well as those wonderfully absurd and violent comics you drew during school, on notebook paper, after you discovered the power and glory of your red marker. I want to try and duplicate the feeling of fun and sense of adventure that was so prevalent during childhood, back when everything was exaggerated, simply because of youth. The working title is 'Team Pocket.'"

"event","Codine: everyone's favorite gigantic wiseman. Codine was the easiest for me to conceptualize and execute. E had given Codine a bulging, oddly-shaped skull and had described him as a 'reptilian mammoth.' I'm not sure that the reptilian came through clearly, but mammoth part certainly did! My version is more elephantine than reptilian, and I think his wrinkled skin, deep-set and heavily-lidded eyes help deliver his inherent intelligence and wisdom effectively. I played around with the bone-structure of his face for a while, but settled on a 'configuration' that created many points around his face, in part to help me draw it correctly from different angles (I don't know if I've quite succeeded in that yet...!) and to also give the illusion, somewhat, of a mask. Capped off with the huge, muscular eyebrow ridges, I've added many dimensions and interesting areas to his face. I really enjoy drawing him and can't wait until I start putting some heavy emotion into him.

In related news, my personal production on the comic has slowed to a halt thanks to a business trip all last week, including preparation and decompression on the weekends (compounded with a family visit, nonetheless.) I look forward to resuming my work on Coiling Spine this week, because I'm worried about falling behind. A GOOD THING. I can never arse myself to do my own work because no one is depending on it, right? This has been one of the biggest reasons I wanted this role. I need to start creating and drawing again, and I have no intention of letting E or the Coiling Spine readers down.

By the way, Portland is a beautiful city. I've never had a city to grow up or walk around in, and I found myself walking the streets of the downtown area at night, after my coworkers, each of them old enough to be one of my parents, had turned into their hotel rooms for the night, and sampling the amazing beers that Portland had to offer. Every night I found myself back in the Virginia Cafe, sitting at the bar, smoking, drinking, making small and useless but friendly talk to whoever was there, doing the same as I. I knew I felt freer than I'd had in years: my wife wasn't waiting for me to come home, my son wasn't counting on me waking up early to get him to daycare, I wouldn't wake the whole family when I walked in the door at some ungodly hour in the morning, setting the dog off... still, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being wildly irresponsible, overly-indulgent. Me, only 24, feeling too old and out of place at a bar geared to the entire range of my generation, a place where I should have found myself every weekend with my friends, maybe with my girlfriend, where we'd talk about the shit that happened or is happening in college, the shit jobs we had while we waited for something better to come along, the asshole in the apartment next door, etc... And here I am, 24, doing business with one of the world's biggest and most notable companies, staying at downright SWANKY hotels that wouldn't be caught dead on the same street block as a dive like this one (humorous exaggeration, of course, you could look down the street at one and see the other,) and the most important thing in my life I could have ever mentioned to someone sitting beside me was that I was really hoping that this trip lead to me becoming more important to my company, fulfilling my own desires for myself and this company, and thusly resulting in promotions/raises so I could by a more reliable family car. What brought me across the entire country to sit in this bar? A Honda Fit.

I never thought I would want to get so specific about the things that drove me on a day-to-day basis. I never thought that a job would drive me to become so introspective about myself. I'm starting to uncover this horribly conflicted personality I've been pretending I was ignoring for seven years, I think. Arrgh, too much to think about right now."

"event","When I decided I would take over artist duties from Darryl for Coiling Spine, I sent him several sketches that showed what direction I would be taking the art in. I'm somewhat of a minimalist in my cartooning. I don't like a lot of flash and extra details that take away from the core of what a character and his ideals should look like. So, when I started designing Kadeo, I looked at what I had to work with: scary skull for a head, lots of spikes and jaggy ends, black trench coat, and tons upon tons of bad-ass-itude.

Because Kadeo needs to deliver so many different emotions and expressions, I felt he would be too limited if I kept his head as a static bone skull. His eyes and mouth needed to be able to stretch and squash, to move like a real cartoon's. With that in mind, I created the dimensions of his head/face. I pulled some inspiration from Steve Dillon's legendary designs for <B>Preacher</B> and modeled him somewhat around the Saint of Killers and a little bit of Cassidy. The decision to turn his trench coat into a long peacoat-style coat came from the somewhat secretive nature of a double-breasted jacket. His body looks bundled up, almost, especially in the post-apocalyptic desert. Kadeo's full of secrets, I think this helps a bit. Peacoats are also the offical coats of the McManus brothers of <B>Boondock Saints</B>.

As for the spikes, I figure a few of you are going to be a bit up in arms about me removing every last one of them, including Kadeo's signature jaw spines curling off of the back of his lower mandible. ""He doesn't even have spiked teeth!"" you say. They were all removed with Darryl's blessing at my desire for a more simple, streamlined cast of characters. Also... I don't want to reveal too many of Kadeo's secrets, but trust me, the spikes aren't gone for good. ;)

I think with the design I've created I can make a better 'Kadeo Experience' for you guys. There are some great things Darryl and I've got cooking and I know you'll enjoy it!"

I've been a screen printer for four of my twenty-four years. The longest I've ever been at a single job was at ArtFX, and now the longest I've been in a single career is screen printing: four years (this is even if you count the food service industry as a career.) I was lucky to find my calling early in my life, and I was lucky that I was able to do it with self-taught skills rather than a college education. I've always considered myself lucky to be at ArtFX, lucky to be in the position I am in life, lucky to have the family I have and the things I own. For some reason I always called myself lucky instead of skillful or gifted or even halfway capable, but these past few months here at Liberty have really helped to teach me what I actually am.

Is humility always right? Should humility fly in the face of the facts? Can you be both objective and humble at the same time? I'm starting to think it's overrated. Nothing is more irksome to the average person than someone who does great things and pretends the things they do are average. Everyone can see how far above and beyond you and your work have gone, and while they don't want you to boast about it, they at least want you to recognize their appreciation without a patronizing, 'It was nothing, anyone could have done that.' The theme of 'The Incredibles': Let the special people be special.

In these seven months I have shown more ambition, drive, and initiative than people who have been in my department for years. I have cross-trained myself into other relevant departments with no prompting. I have opened up stronger communications between the Art Department and the R&D Department. I have, on multiple occasions, been told I was the best hire this company has ever made and that I am more valuable than people who have at least a half-decade of seniority over me, that I was more reliable, more efficient, more thorough, more skillful and faster than people who have been doing this for years. In my second month I broke the record of single jobs done in one month, a record that had stood untouched for six years.

That's not the product of luck. That's the product of hard work and skill, and now their fruits are coming to bear. The second week of March will be my first business trip, ever. I'm flying across the country to train with experts in my field, the best of the best, and give presentations to the second-largest retailer of athletic gear in the world. I am becoming more important to my company and, as a result, more important to the industry as well. I am finally doing the amazing things that I wanted to do with my life. This is particularly important because today is the fourth anniversary of my hiring into the screen printing industry. On this day four years ago I pinned and tagged shirts on the dusty, box-covered floor of ArtFX. Today, I am the most important art department member in one of the world's largest screen printing companies. A company which, at one point in its history, was the best of the best, the pioneer of techniques and prints that are commonplace today but ahead of their time.

Today, the people who helped make Liberty the industry leader and R&D king, and subsequently, in their laurel-resting and stagnation, removed it from its throne, are gone. Years of stifled creativity, bottled and capped off by a few prima donnas, will now issue forth, and I find myself at the front of the flow. A few weeks from now we will be presenting our new face to our most important customer, one of the most important and significant companies in America, and I will be there. I will be the face of the art department, the new creative drive of Liberty, the herald of something new.

Today is when I move from being lucky to being just. that. damn. good. It has been years of hard work, years of sacrifice and pain and toil, but today it pays off. Today I become what I've always wanted to become. Today I am awesome. Today I am recognized and rewarded. Today I overcome my age and lack of formal education and MAKE IT."

"event","I don't like talking about people behind their back. I hate it even more when I have to do it on the internet, and the reasons for that are pretty much dumb: I don't consider the 'net a replacement for my social life, but a tool, and I can't shake the feeling that people who get so upset and so angry about anonymous people say about them are overreacting simply by reacting to them. I have to constantly remind myself, however, that this is not the case. Yes, you run the risk of interacting with some colossal sub-human douchebags online, but everyone you talk to is a person. People with opinions and feelings and philosophies and gastro-intestinal problems and inner demons and psychological disorders... all rendered inconsequential thanks to the power of anonymity, if that person so chooses. People are free to judge and reprimand and insult and infer and praise and laugh at or with anything that you choose to let out from behind that mask, and those things become your mask, and you become an electric mass of statements, strung together to create your own personal stereotype. It's real life distilled and given a cartoon avatar.

What I mean by this is that it's hard to take the internet seriously when it's populated by so many idiots, idiots who have turned the internet into a cesspool of poor grammar, horrible taste, bizarre slang, attention whores, and trolls. It's hard to see the internet--those of us that have really explored it--for anything more than a gathering of slap-fighting retards. Those of us that have found decent places to post ourselves cling to them as if they were the last bastions of sanity they'd ever find. I've been lucky in that I've found several, but I'm also lucky in another way: I've made the fastest friendships as any I've ever had thanks to the internet, and absolutely no enemies. Better than real life, eh?

The reason behind this is simple: I just don't care about what people who I've never seen, nor talked to, nor have any reason to respect, have to say about me. This goes for acquaintances online and in real life. I have excellent control of my emotions in this regard: I don't let anything piss me off if I don't want to be pissed off. Why waste perfectly good emotions on people who I don't consider worth them?

The best part about this, is, of course, the power of being able to ignore someone. I've always waited, just a bit fearfully, for someone to post something inflammatory about me, and, despite all odds, it actually turns out to be true. I have a pretty good handle on all of my flaws and imperfections, so it would genuinely surprise me when someone points out something less than desirable about me that I didn't suspect. So if this happened, I could deny it to that person as long as I wanted to, and argue them right back, and examine myself without having to let anyone know.

Yes, that COULD happen, but I'm responsible enough to admit to myself and others when I'm wrong. Depending on the delivery of the person who pointed something out to me, I would even respect them enough to admit myself to them as well. Some people, however, wouldn't deserve such respectable treatment.

And here I come, finally, to the whole entire situation that caused me to write all of this out: The reason I haven't anything to fear from the internet is because I have held myself to the one standard that is in both real life and on the internet, the one standard that everyone is held to and, in most cases, the only standard that anyone is ever held to: <B>Don't be an ass.</B>

You remember how I said I didn't like talking behind people's backs? Well, this is a public journal. Anyone can see this, and I'll support what I say here until I change my mind: Peregrin, you showed me a great kindness in the past, letting me know of a forum where I would be allowed to stretch some creative muscle when it had atrophied, and I thank you for it. I no longer go to that forum for my own reasons, but the only reason I'm mentioning this right now is to illustrate how my opinion on you has turned a complete 180. Your posts on my most beloved forum are nothing but disrespectful, poorly-reasoned, pseudo-intellectual trollings. What I see in you is an immature little prat wearing the trappings of intelligence but deriving none of the benefits that coming to rational conclusions through intelligent discourse should bear. You sit in a shell that you've made out of assumptions, conjecture, and absolutes, and attempt to fit whatever you see into your skewed world-view. Out of this shell you can only see one perspective, and what you see is reflected off of the carnival mirrors of flawed logic you have created. And you, inside of that shell, are little more than a strangely egotistical, paranoid, immature nerd (in the literal sense,) with a misplaced persecution complex. You think we hold you to higher standards because <I>you're not American, because you speak more than one language? You think there is some sort of double-standard? You think we view you as a threat? You think we're frightened of you?</i> GET OVER YOURSELF. <B>GET OVER YOURSELF!</B> We hold you to one standard, and one standard only: <B>Don't be an ass.</B> For all of your supposed intelligence, you fail to see that the cause of all of the flak you're getting is YOU. Your uneducated opinions, your ludicrous blanket statements, your inability to view questions from other people's perspectives, your laughable inability to see things in shades of grey, and your rampant series of biases and prejudices are nothing short of embarassing, and your inability to consider any of this a fault of your own is simply unintelligent and unscientific. And that is truly a waste.

It is a waste because I have no doubt in my mind you are intelligent, but you have fallen into a trap. You have reinforced your intelligence and what you know so many times without testing or expanding your own world-view that it has become fact for you. Your neatly-ordered and defined world has prevented you from having rational discourse with people who are in the REAL world, and because you see yourself and your logic as infallible, you have no other way to explain the disdain other people hold for you than assuming it is your fault. You are inflexible, intolerable, and oblivious to reality. You have made a mask for yourself, and now you have become that mask, all for the sake of exulting your own supposed intelligence.

"event","I haven't forgotten about my journal, or of the few people who lift their eyebrow in surprise when they see me in the middle of their friends page. ;)

Coiling Spine sits with two out of seven pages complete. I would like to announce that this is not the usual rate of production, for anyone who may be worried about the sort of thing. When I signed onto this thing I knew I would have to make time for it, but no one expects the things that can't be expected, and no one can schedule the things that have to be done. It's hard when you want to devote an entire Saturday afternoon to drawing and inking but your son, for some inexplicable reason, just won't play quiety by himself in the middle of the floor and insists you sit quiety by and watch him play. Oh no, you can't play with him. Don't touch my trains, don't build that tower. 'Lookit, lookit, lookit.' I love you to death, Darwin, but I have other things to do today than watch you play. Independence is something you're going to want!

So, again, drawing is regulated to a strictly past 9:00PM thing. I don't want my progress to sound too pathetic, but I can guarantee a good, exciting end result.

In completely out of left-field topic, I've been worried about developing a bad habit, so I've cut back on drinking. It's not like I was actually drinking an inappropriately large amount before then--yes, there were a few times when at a party or gathering I lost all sense of decency and control and always, later, regretted it--but when I found myself craving a beer like I would a good dish, I stopped myself.

I come from a family that has had it's fair share of alcoholics. My dad has been sober for at least half of my life, while my mother's parents' livers failed them. So we have a varying success rate, here. I never considered myself one until Jen pointed out that the craving could very well be a withdrawal symptom. How can you define alcoholism, then? I would not 'do anything' just for a drink, I don't like getting drunk, and my drinking does not interfere with my personal, professional, or familial life. I'm actually surprised that I'm quite cultured about beer. It's not a lifestyle or a hinderance, it's a hobby. Tasting and rating beers, along with collecting the bottles and hunting down 'rare' brews... I'm sure there are alcoholics who do those things, but can I set myself apart from them with the reasons I do them? Because I want to educate myself, because I want to experience new tastes and techniques, because I have dreams of a collection of bottles, spanning an entire wall, with every bottle different from the next? THESE are the things I want. I don't want to sate some internal reliance on an addicting substance, and I don't want to start.

So I'm cutting back... and I tell myself that I don't want to--because that's the truth, I don't really want to--and I tell myself that I don't want to for the sake of my hobby, but is it just the burgeoning seed of alcoholism behind the mask of sophistication?

And somehow, writing this all down, getting it out there, makes it even more confusing for me."

I could have sworn on Monday morning I felt great, after a bout with some intestinal distress on Sunday, but by the end of the day a horrific lump appeared in my throat, signalling that I would not be good on Tuesday. So, Tuesday's here and my head feels like it's bursting at the seams (that's a figure of speech, my head has no seams.) But the good news is that we had our Holiday party today in the art department. The food was good and the gift exchange was actually very fun. Everyone got what they wanted, except for me: I had put that I wanted a coffee mug stuffed with a pair of ludicrous socks on my list. That's actually what I wanted, right? No, my friend Chris got my name and bought me a Master Replica Lord of the Rings Glowing Sting Sword! What an awesome gift, he even got me batteries for it. Chris is a cool guy, I need to buy him something awesome.

As for Coiling Spine, it's progressing very well, but even moreso, I feel that my skill as an illustrator is progressing even better. Sketching is coming more naturally, and though I sent Darryl character designs that I'm still very faithful to, I can feel and see the characters and the art evolving as I do them. I'm most excited about how... well... I guess that would be a spoiler!"

"event","I have the first two scripts that I will be drawing for Coiling Spine. In my downtime at work, and at lunch, I was able to sketch out the entire first comic on a sheet and a quarter of legal-sized paper, and I am very happy with the results.

Some background, I guess, is necessary. I haven't drawn in years. I can safely say I drew every damn day up to five years ago, and then I stopped. Sometimes I like to think that I had a good damn reason, like a full-time job and school, a fiance, a wife, a new home, a son, but I never convinced myself. Even when it seemed I had all of the obvious symptoms of ADD, I still didn't want to parade it out in front of me like some excuse, some cross to bear. I cut caffine entirely out of my diet and many of the problems I had with focus, memory, and recall went away. That was good for a while, but I still never drew.

That's not to say I wasn't creative, if you can use that word for getting ideas and doing nothing with them but developing them in your head. I've had more ideas for things I'd love to create in my head than I think I've ever had.

I know a lot of it has to do with procrastination and laziness, but also with validation and contentment, and, most sinister and horrible of all, addiciton. I found something that would give me validation and contentment very easily, with little in the way of work, and I became addicted to it. Every part of my being that devoted itself to drawing and creating was consumed by this addiciton and it became my life. It's too bad I had to keep it in private for the duration of my addiction, barring me from any sort of external praise for whatever I had acheived, but addiction to internet porn is not the sort of thing you tell people about.

I can, now, that I haven't touched the sauce, if you will, since April 17th of this year. I'm more ashamed of the addiciton than I am of the actual content, to tell the truth. This addiction is more commonplace than anyone could ever think and it's somewhat liberating to finally admit you're weak and give into internal compulsions that, deep down inside of yourself, you find distasteful. It helps to know that someone else might share your misery.

...

Yeah, so imagine all of that shit between five years ago and now. I can hardly do it, but for me to create something that I feel twinges of pride for these days, well, color me shocked.

Darryl's original design needs no changing; no obvious changes made just to be different will be done. This is what we've already seen: a dexterous, agile humanoid capable of extending his limbs (and even hair,) who combats his enemies in very close combat. Darryl has told me that he is very cat-like, which isn't overly alien for a humanoid to be emulating but suitable for someone of such a modus operandi as his. I think I will be attempting a more fluid/primate like movement when he gets more vicious and a distinct cat-like posture when he isn't. He's going to be constantly changing and very kinetic.

That is, if he's more than a burning cinder by the time I get the script. I really hope I get to work with the Dancing Man."

Yet, I still have to get sketches to Darryl. I've got designs of all of the characters made, and some variations of Kadeo, but now I'm running into the problem that always slays me when I start feeling creative: Designing, for me, is not the hard part. When it comes to characters and how they are supposed to look and feel, I guess I'm just easy to please. I have an idea in my mind how that character should look, given their voice and personality, and I find that the fine-tuning of the character's look comes as the story progresses.

Which means that, in order for me to keep the creative juices flowing, I'm going to need a script soon so I can start creating actual content.

That's the problem of drawing your inspiration and drive from creating content: if you're not creating any, then who knows when you'll actually start creating again?

Jen left a note for me on the door yesterday. She was offered an amazing position at Thrill of the Hunt. Some backstory: Jen, Darwin, and I go to this little antiques store in Greensboro. Jen falls in love with the place and thinks about working there. Deciding she really didn't want a job, she instead volunteers. She polishes silver for Carol, the lovable proprietor, for a week, before Carol offers her a job. Jen accepts, and after three months, Carol offers her a job as a store 'manager.' Jen would file, keep track of consignment costs, write checks, look up and schedule trips to flea markets, estate sales, etc... essentially, a lot of paperwork and planning. Something that Jen would be awesome at.

I read the note and was overjoyed. Darwin and I didn't even get in the door, we turned right around and went to Total Wine for a bottle of her favorite wine: Kendall Jackson Reisling. 

Yeah, and I also bought a bunch of beers for myself. Hey, I was celebrating!

Jen came home from Mimi's Cafe at 11:30 last night. I was waiting for her, drew her a bath, poured her a glass, and we talked about this new development.

I still can't wrap my head around how crazy lucky we've been here in Greensboro. I've found my dream job, Jen's found her dream job, we've got our dream house in our dream neighborhood with dream schools for Darwin to go to... I think the big chunk of bad luck that was dropped on our laps with the sale of our house is finally inverting.

The sketches went over very well, by the way! Esc is a bit concerned over some details in the characters, and I'm happy to oblige on some of them, but I'm a little worried about some. My version of Kadeo does not have the swept-back inverted jaw spikes that his did. I find them distracting and unnecessary. Although I wouldn't call my designs minimalist, particularly, I would definitely say I'm inspired by it. Nothing that shouldn't be there will be there, nice simple areas of color... I'm pulling a lot of influence from Bruce Timm (Batman: TAS) and from Tom Siddell (Gunnerkrigg Court.) I think Esc knows where each of our strengths lie, and that he knows that what I've done so far have been very respectful interpretations. With everything else, though, the final verdict rests on the fans.

For fans of the comic who have found this journal, I'm going to tease you. The script I'm recieving is going to be unexpected and very, very cool.

Yup."

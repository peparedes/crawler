"event","just thinkin and i wish i new more people who cared about animals as much as i do, really itd be great but just not enough people care. some people use the excuse its not going to change so why bother? with a attitude like that youll get no where one person makes a differnce.. every person counts. if you recognise one form of oppression, you should be able to recognise the rest dont limit your compassion to whats considered ""right"" non-domestic animals breathe, feel, and love just like the rest of us let them have a chance at life, no one should have the power to decided who should die and wont we are all the same!!! we all feel! and want a chance to live.. fuck the people who disagree."

"event","yea another entry because of boredom.. 
i bought a book the other day its awsome best book ive ever read, Wild Things by Britta Jaschinski. I will read it to you my journal lol.. well write it whatever the books just awsome.. okay here it goes:

WILD THINGS
""If a lion could speak, we would not understand him.""
Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951)

dear animals
once upon a time
nearly four billion years ago
earth was devoid of
life
when life did appear it was first in water
then...
higher organisms appeared which gave rise to more complex life
human existence
is purely accidental
in the main we are part of what we call
nature
human numbers put great pressure and stress
on the natural enviroment
we should not ignore another extremely powerful
motivation
the aspiration to increase human welfare and
comfort
we now conserve individual animals in
captivity
but we do not protect your
habitats
or the ecosystem
where will you
live
when we reintroduce you to the 
wild?
what will you eat
if the food chain has been systematically 
eroded?
it seems clear that we have been doing to you what we are on teh verge of doing to
ourselves
i hope you dont mind me telling you that your strength
and craving for an unrestricted existence
make you quite anachronistic
maybe that is why people consider you incompatible
with modern times
i have collected these images for all of us
your devoted friend
this book is dedicated to ed and all things that remain wild.

- its awsome no shit buy it, you need the photos for the full effect it makes you cry. well again until next time...- peace"

"event","*Sigh* Because of what Hojo did to me I do not age...And cannot die easily, not even by my own hand. Believe me, I've tried. I grow tired of this life...Seeing everyone happy around me is just so...Well, it reminds me of the days when Lucercia and I used to be happy. It just reminds me that I have no one left on this earth. I'm just so alone, to end my life now would be to fail Lucrecia, to fail at my atonement. I just want to stop these demons whispering in my ear...I want these endless voices to stop. I want my body to be rid of this plague. Perhaps, I should just go back to Nibleheim to continue my eternal sleep, no one wants me here...I cast a dark shadow over the young lovers...I'll make this endless pain cease..."

"event","I miss my darling Lucrecia...Lucrecia...I suppose it's time to tell my story to the world...When I was a Turk for the Shinra, I was assigned a mission in Nibleheim. A scientist for Shinra ((Who was Hojo's assistant)) And I fell in love with eachother. Bare in mind that I was not the monsterous creature I am now...Ah, but I still had blood on my hands, ah, yes...To continue on with my story, lucrecia and I fell in love. We spent all our time together when she wasn't working or when I wasn't busy patrolling the area. We would often go to the waterfall by the outskirts of Nibelheim. It was so wonderful there, and I cherished the moments we had together. It was about a year later when I proposed to her in the center of Nibelheim...How I remember that day so clearly. She started crying, I was bewildered. I asked her what was the matter, she placed the ring in my hand and ran off. Later she was to be found in the arms of Hojo. Throughout the following weeks I couldn't look at her, I didn't want to cause her anymore pain. Finally she came to me saying that she was pregnant and Hojo wanted to inject the baby with Jenova cells. I objected and wwent down to the labratory where Hojo and I got into a fight. Furious, I went to my room and stayed there until the next morning. Only later did I find out that Lucrecia was calling for me. I went to her room and was shocked to find her in labor. I was told to wait outside the door, which I did, and after the labor was finished and the attendant rushed out holding a silver haired child in her arms. The boy had such lovely eyes! I went into Lucrecia's room where she held my hand...

   ""Vincent, I love you...I always had...Please protect Sephiroth, we can go off together, you, me and Sephiroth. You can raise him as your own...And he'll call you Daddy and...and""

  Her head tilted to the side and she was gone. I think I screamed her name over and over before rushing out of the room, tears of rage and sorrow withing my eyes. I went down to the labrotory where Hojo was. I screamed at him, telling him that he needed to save Lucrecia. He just smirked and told me that she could die for all he cared, she had served his purpose. I blinked slowly, tears sliding down my face as I turned around and picked up Sephiroth who was on a cold metal table. Hojo pulled out a revolver from his coat and shot me...All I remember is still holding Sephiroth as I was plunged into darkness...It was only later, in my coffin, did I relize that Hojo had experimented on me...Putting 4 demons within my body, a gold gauntlet on my arm, and making me so I would never age...It was a horrible thing to find out...Don't you think...I'm sorry that my story has lacked detail...For I must now sleep..."

Oh, how they have fallen
The dreamers, the soarers
Oh, how they have been chained

Bound and screaming
Your right there with them
Your screaming stops
The momentum sways

The eyes of you captures
The fallen angels
Bound and screaming
Your right there with them

To stand back and watch
Watching as your hit
Watching as she's hit
That's all you'll ever be good for

You could have stopped it
What did you do?
The force of the pain
Does it stay with you now?

She must hate you
You couldn't protect her
Protect yourself
Does it stay with you now?

Bound and screaming
Your right there with them."

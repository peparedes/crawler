"event","so this morning and this afternoon i went golfing with Blair's family. 

let me backtrack for a second, cause it has been a while since i have posted here. 

for those of you who don't know my best friend Blair passed away last month and i have been in Durban, South Africa for about 4 weeks. i won't get into all the details but Blair's family and i never really got along. they are a very prominent family in South Africa and England and Blair refused to live their luxury lifestyle. i encouraged Blair to be his own person and not worry about his trust fund and because i encouraged him, his family made it a point to let him and i both know they didn't like me or his flatmates here. 

so back to golf. Blair's brother called me and asked if i wanted to join them this morning for golf. knowing Blair never ever had cruel bone in his body and never held grudges, i went along. it was pretty much a big pat yourself on the back session, but i did manage to get some cool shots with my camera.

most of the stuff, i type in here is just silly banal stuff. i really don't talk much about my personal life. no reason why i don't, i just choose not to. but over the last week or so a series of events has led me to take things in my life much more serious. so while i contemplated deleting this journal, i have decided to keep it for me and maybe a select few of you who i don't mind reading it. if i keep you on the friends list, it is because i feel that we can relate to each  other on some level. if i delete you it is either cause i don't feel we are on the same wavelength or it is cause i don't think you're the type of person i really need in my life. no hard feelings, i am sure some will get offended, but honestly i don't care. don't call me, don't message me, don't email me. it really isn't cause i don't like you. just accept that. so that being said. i am done. however, i do expect all of you to buy my novel when it is done. is that selfish? yeah, it is. you can leave a comment if you want. they are screened."

2. And on the subject of phones, who came up with text messaging? Fuck that guy in the ear. I tried it the other night, it took me five minutes to key in ""call me later"" to a friend, who ended up calling me in the middle of my text message and left me a voice mail that said, ""text me later dawg!"" What a fucking waste of technology. And to people who have long conversations via text messaging - pick up the fucking phone and talk to them you socially inept chode huffer.

3. People waiting in line for the release of new video games. Hey, dudes, want a sure fire way to guaruantee you won't feel the warm touch of a woman for the next five years? Stand out in line in front of a video game store for a few hours. Nothing says chronic masterbater like wearing a Halo t-shirt and standing in front of Game Crazy at 10 PM with your fellow gamers. Geek factor +10 for all you fuckers.

4. People with teddy bears in their cars. Okay, I can understand a 16 year female doing this, but every time I see a guy in his suped up Honda complete with teddy bears staring at me from the back window I get a good idea of who wears the pants in that relationship. Knock that shit off...it's a fucking car, not your bedroom.

5. The pens in my office. Or should I say, the lack of. Fuck, I buy a ten pack of those blue Papermate medium point pens every week and sure as shit, come friday they are gone. They're not in the desk drawers, the delivery vans, the breakroom, the back office, the floor, the garbage, my clipboard or pockets. Conclusion: they're being abducted by aliens in some weird Area 51 conspiracy to rid the world of simple communication. Guess I'll have to text message everything since I can't find a fucking pen to write it down.

"event","..do yourself a favor, go ahead and call her a liar
and ignore her plea for assistance. Or get ready for
Psycho Drama Hour when you take your valuable time to
render requested aid.

Last night my girlfriend came tearing into the room
all jacked up and said ""OH! MY! GOD! I! GAINED! THREE!! POUNDS!!!
Don't let me eat ANYTHING for at least four days, okay?""

""Sure baby, no prob."" I said and went back to ESPN. Seemed silly
to me because she is a professional model and waifer thin but whatever.
I quit trying to find rational thinking in female behavior around age seven.

So this morning she shows up on the couch with a small bowl
of sliced peaches and fresh strawberries for breakfast, just
to test me I guess. Almost annoyed me that she wasn't
making a better effort but I'm a good guy so I didn't react.
Other than to provide the help she asked for just a few hours before.

""What's up Pizza Hut,"" I said ""sleep good?""
She stopped the fork in mid-lift, delicious peach slice dangling.
Looking over at me with a (fake) confused look, she asks ""Wha...what did you just say?""
""I said, how did you sleep, my sweet tub of cookie dough?""
She dropped the fork back into the bowl and even I was imnpressed with my skill.

""Tub of cookie dough!??"" she said, looking even more shocked, for effect
I guess.
""Look Krispy Kreme, will you pipe down until the Jetsons are over?""
I mean seriously, I did my job so let me enjoy the crazy space antics of George and Co, in peace.

But no.
Now she stands up, facing me, mouth hanging open and eyes wide in
mock horror. She stood staring at me like I had just dropped in from space too.
What the hell I thought good-naturedly, I'll play it out.

""That's nice Jumbotron,"" I said ""but I won't need you until the game comes on this afternoon.""

Her eyes got huge, mouth open wide with a small squeak and then she turned and ran to the bedroom sobbing uncontrollably.

Oh Jesus. What now, I wondered as I enjoyed the peaches and strawberries.
But despite my curiosity I respected her privacy and left her alone to cry it out.

Soon she stormed out of the bedroom with her overnight bag, heading for the door at top speed.
She REALLY was over-playing it a bit but I relaized it was important to let
her know I am committed to her happiness and would spare no effort to help her.

""Hey Amtrak, would ya toss me the paper on your way out of the station?""
I called out over my shoulder between bites. ""Where you off to? Is there
a cake sale at Sams Club?""

""I HATE YOU!!!!"" she shrieked and I laughed before
replying ""and I love both of you too, Ben & Jerry.""

It was getting hard to keep a straight face and I was starting
to really enjoy this helpful side of me.

But it turns out she was really pissed, she leaves, slamming the door
on her way out. From the driveway I hear a distant ""BASTARD!"" which
is when I began to suspect she had gone all sideways on me.

Apparently she really believes I did something wrong here.
I called her a few hours later after cartoons were over and she
just kept hanging up after yelling juvenile, profane insults into the phone.
Jesus - women, complete nut jobs just waiting to go off.
And if you don't give them a reason, no problem. They'll happily make one up.

Guess I'll have to microwave my own cheese dip and chips today.
No big deal.

At least it will be quiet."

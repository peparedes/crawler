"event","The picture below reminded me of something I used to do in high school to my friend, Deb. I had this little white eraser that was used into the shape of the oval. Mind you I had recently watched something about the mass slaughtering of baby seals on Discovery Channel. So like the morbid person I am, I drew a little baby seal face on the eraser. I'd get Deb's attention in Biology class and took my pen and whacked the eraser (seal) hard on the head and proceeded to mock skin it alive. I would tack on ""and that's how the baby seal dies...it's skinned alive. Save the baby seals!"" I was a strange girl. Still am. I'm just better at hiding it these days.

Food blog comment: I'm pretty sure baby seals eat fish. I like fish. Especially sushi."

"event","I guess I should blog about my vacation food before it all turns fuzzy. Memories tend to fade quickly in old age. For this trip I used the Canon SX200IS that I got for Christmas to take all my food pics. I am not an amateur food blogger nor do I aspire to be. 

I will be updating this little by little and adding captions later. Here we go.

"event","Just so that people know I'm still alive and kicking. Just got back from a quick trip to San Francisco. My sis had her baby, Zachary, on Friday the 12th. I am now aunt to the 7th power. My 5th nephew has been added to the growing brood. He's a cutie. <3
Didn't eat anything spectacular while I was visiting. I did go to old school chinese italian place, Little Henry's. But pretty much made it through Chinese New Year's day meatless. Which was really hard because one day a year I don't allow myself to eat meat and that's the day I crave it the most. Go figure. 
We had dinner out at New Hing Lung on Saturday night which was mediocre chinese food. I know I'm picky about my chinese food, but I'd eat Pei Wei anyday. I figure if I go out for authentic chinese food it has to be of a certain caliber. But if my intention is to eat something like Pei Wei, my standards are lowered. Anyways, no real updates in the food front. Meh chinese food, that is all."

"event","<p>I love books where you can love the characters. Meridian is a Fenestra. She opens windows for souls to cross to the other side, the good other side. Tens is the guy who has been dreaming about her and her protector. Her great aunt and also her namesake is also a Fenestra. She teaches Meridian what she can before she passes through the window. <br />The only thing I can say is a negative about this book is that the plotline is predictable. Maybe because I've read too many YA novels in the last year that. This one kept saying, "" I have a bad feeling about that guy."" No shit Sherlock. All in all it was a fun and light read. Definitely a must read if you like YA.<br />Food blog requirement: Auntie made the best mac 'n cheese and chocolate cake for Meridian. It made me salivate just thinking about it. Being a Fenestra, they really love comfort food and sweets. <br />Prior to this I read The Awakening and The Summoning by Kelley Armstrong. I might do a review on that, but not sure yet.</p><p><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/0004g4dp"" width=""127"" height=""193"" alt="""" /></p><p><em><small>Posted via <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/cosysoftware_en/"">LiveJournal.app</a>.</small></em></p>"

So my friends and I decided to catch a second round of New Moon tonight. My mission this time was to write down every song with its corresponding scene. 

Monsters by Hurricane Bells - Arriving at school on Bella's 18th birthday.

The Violet Hour by Sea Wolf - Bella's 18th birthday party, before she gets thrown into the glass table by our beloved Edward.

Satellite Heart by Anya Marina - After Carlisle patches Bella up and Edward is driving Bella home in her truck.

Roslyn by Bon Iver & St. Vincent - Bella printing out pictures, classmates picture taking on the day of the breakup. Gah!

Possibility by Lykke Li - This scene actually made me tear up. This is Bella in her catatonic state with the months rolling by and the screaming in bed because there's a hole in her chest where her heart should be. 

I Belong To You by Muse - Bella and Jessica's movie night planning and then after the movie walking on the street. 

Friends by Band of Skulls - Bella hops on the bike with a stranger at a bar. First time she sees figment Edward. 

Random song not on the OST playing on the radio the first day Bella and Jacob work on the bikes. (Found it...All I Believe In by The Magic Numbers & Amadou & Mariam)

Shooting the Moon by OK Go - Bella and Jacob bond over fixing the bikes together. 

Done All Wrong by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club - Emily's house with the wolf gang. 

Hearing Damage by Thom Yorke- My favorite scene of the entire movie. I can watch this over and over. Victoria gets chased by the wolves, Harry Clearwater (I heard he made the best fish fry) dies of a heart attack and Bella contemplates jumping of a cliff. 

Slow Life by Grizzly Bear - Bella unconscious underwater after jumping off the cliff. Figment Edward shows up before Jacob drags her out. 

No Sound But The Wind by Editors - Bella and Edward driving home from ""the vote"" and Jacob shows up in the middle of the road. 

New Moon (Meadow) by Alexandre Desplat - ""On one condition...Marry Me"" and again as first song of the closing credits.

A White Demon Love Song by The Killers - Second song of the closing credits.

Meet Me On the Equinox by Death Cab for Cutie - Third song of the closing credits.

Food Blog Requirement: Now that I think about it, there were very few food scenes in New Moon. Ok, there were Emily's muffins, those looks pretty delicious. 

Favorite scene: Victoria's chase scene

Most moving scene: Bella in her catatonic state with the months passing

Funniest scene: Edward in his vest running after ""after""-Bella

Most romantic scene: Edward and Bella after Bella saves him from walking into the sun. I wanted ""blackest kind of blasphemy"" but it was good anyways. 

I love the book the best out of the four so by default I really love this movie. They did a good job considering that the books are rather long."

"event","I made pumpkin cupcakes for a potluck tomorrow. They turned out alright. Not great. Nothing to write home about, you know what I mean? Something about putting pumpkin puree into baking left me wondering what in the world I was thinking. For one, I hate fruit. Secondly, I rarely try to bake new things for people that I have not tested before. 

Below is the prep of ingredients...there were many, most I already had on hand, thank goodness.

Here's the ""pumpkin citrus cupcake"". My friend suggested I name it that because the orange zest in the frosting was overpowering the pumpkin flavor. So instead of changing the frosting, change the name.

"event","I'm not sure if I want to turn this into a book blog as well as a food blog. But I guess this'll give me more fodder to blog about. Anyways, I finished reading the first four of five books in Karen Marie Moning's Fever series: Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, and Dreamfever. The last one which is scheduled to be released in 2010, still doesn't have an official release date. I need the last book like I need air. Well, not really but I hate waiting for books to come out. 
From all the reviews I had read before finally just sucking it up and reading the series, I heard it was kinda racy/smutty. So I kinda put it off as long as I could because I'm not into the whole Harlequin romance genre. Which I will tell you this is not that genre despite the cover of Darkfever. Not the one shown below. 
Anyways, the book's main character is MacKayla (Mac) Lane. Her sister, Alina, is murdered while she was living in Dublin. So Mac sets off to Ireland to find her sister's killer. She finds out she is a sidhe-seer, she can see fae, and she's a Null, she can stop fae temporarily with her touch. She can also track the Sinsar Dubh which is an Unseelie book of evil. But is the book seeking her? Anyways, there is of course the main love interest, Jericho Barrons. And some minor one's like V'lane (Seelie prince, death-by-sex fae) and Christian Keltar, who can sense lies. The story has quite a few twists and turns. Barrons is my favorite. He is like my Dimitri from the Vampire Academy series. Dark, broody, and mysterious. Is he in love with Mac? She sure seems to get under his skin. Well, they kinda really got into each other's skins, if you know what I mean. But it wasn't too graphic. Anyways, you can see cracks in his tough facade every now and then and it really warms your heart. At least it does mine. It's an awesome series and I can't wait until Shadowfever comes out.

Food blog requirement: Mac ends up eating Unseelie fae which is gray, pustular and still flops around as she's eating it. Chew on that (kinda crunchy)"

"event","<p>Before I left for my trip to Japan, my coworker gave me the most helpful tip: In most establishments, there is at least one western-style toilet all the way in the back of the restroom. <br />Otherwise you'll be using these:</p><p><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/000454gs"" width=""400"" height=""279"" alt="""" /></p><p>Unfortunately, there were three occasions where there was no western-style toilet and I was relegated to using one of these floor toilets. I remember these three occasions: Narita Airport (maybe I didn't look hard enough, maybe I used it for the novelty of it), Gion (public toilet), and a park restroom on the tour. <br />I don't like floor toilets, let me tell you why. <br />There's water in it, so the splash-effect when flushing, splashes urine onto the floors. The floors have urine on them so they smell bad and you have to step in it. I had to wash my slippers that night after Gion. I was so grossed out. No wonder the ""no street shoes in the house"" rule is so strict over there. Blech. My last gripe is that it's like a tightrope balancing act trying not to fall in when you're wearing jeans or any non-stretchy long pants. Boys are so lucky.<br />I would count my blessings every time I found a western-style toilet. But from one extreme to the next, we go from no-tech to high-tech.</p><p><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/00046p5f"" width=""250"" height=""268"" alt="""" /></p><p>These toilets had seat warmers, butt washers, buttons galore, and sometimes played music as you were tinkling. It would have been nice, but the flush button depending on the model/brand would be in a different place, one of them had the flush on the wall two feet away from the toilet itself. Needless to say my stress level rose everytime I had to hunt for the flush button. Thankfully I always spotted the Chinese character at the last moment. <br />I remember the high-tech toilet brand was usually TOTO. Thought you'd like to know.</p><p><em><small>Posted via <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/cosysoftware_en/"">LiveJournal.app</a>.</small></em></p>
Since this is supposed to be a food blog, let me add that the floor toilets made me lose my appetite."

I would pick up my drug of choice, drive home, lock myself in my room, inhale, and throw away the evidence in the outside garbage can. <br />No I'm not talking about drugs, I'm talking about the Yoshinoya Beef Bowl. I have since admitted publicly about my addiction, so it's no longer a secret. I'd shout it from the top of the highest mountain, I LOVE YOSHINOYA and I don't care what anyone else thinks.

Arrived in Hong Kong International Airport early Saturday morning for a connecting flight to Tokyo. Met up with LT, my travel partner for the remainder of the trip. She flew out from SFO and arrived about half an hour before I did. 

Ate = Singapore Laksa noodles at noodle shop at the terminal. LT had the Dan Dan noodles.
My noodles
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/0000805h/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/0000805h/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

5 hour flight to Narita Airport in Tokyo. LT did not have a seat next to me since we checked into our flights separate while we were still in the States. 

Ate = Fish in gelatinous sauce over rice. I recall it being gingery. The flavor and texture was interesting. 
Fish w/ rice, fruit salad, strawberry yogurt & roll (which I'd eaten by the time I remembered to take the pic)
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/00009dpe/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/00009dpe/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

We arrived at the Narita airport and this was when the fun began. We didn't speak a lick of Japanese but we managed to find our way to Japan Railway office with a lot of pointing and questioning the locals. Got our JR pass ($277 for 7-days) and took the Narita Express and Chuo Line to Shinjuku where we checked into the Hilton Tokyo Hotel. We got upgraded to the Executive Floor. WIN! Room was beautifully appointed. Best hotel room of the trip. Very modern. 
Took rail to Ginza and got lost trying to find the Komparu-yu onsen, which is a public bath, that we found in Lonely Planet guide. The cause for confusion was that the name ""Komparu-yu"" was for the show that was on next door. This made finding the place really difficult. Must have asked at least 5 people on the street about it. Once we got to the onsen, LT walked right into the bath with her street shoes on. The lady behind the counter started yelling at us. So we left. ""The place was dead anyway"". It was not what we had expected, although the Lonely Planet guide did mention it was really old school. I thought it was going to be faux-dive, but it was just dive. 

Ate = Had dinner at a noodle shop near the Ginza station that used vending machines to order food. The food was delicious, but it might have been because I was so hungry. 
Udon noodles and tempura
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/0000af6q/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/0000af6q/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Snacked on = Oreo bar. It was pretty tasty. Did not find regular Oreos.

Spent all day on the plane (Cathay Pacific @ 1:45am). Got an aisle seat so the 14 hour plane ride was bearable. The flight was uneventful. Although I did wake up mid-flight thinking that I was over water and at any moment I can plunge into my watery grave. 

Ate = Airplane food (2 meals). I kinda had to take these pictures quickly so lighting was not the best. Was afraid that others would think I'm weird for taking pics of airplane food. 

Salmon with mashed potatoes, potato salad w/ smoked salmon, cheesecake, and a roll

"event","Came back this morning from a weekend in SF. The Bay Bridge was closed ALL weekend, which made life as we know it very inconvenient. 

Thursday evening: Arrived in OAK. Picked up some ABC (I call it ""Already Been Chewed"" food). Beef chow fun and chicken wings. I didn't get a stomach ache so I call that meal a success. 

Friday: Walked up the avenues to the 'rents and had lunch there of bittermelon with beef, lamb stew, beef stew, and steamed pork spareribs. Very yum. My mom is the best home cook ever. I would be a very fat daughter if I still lived at home. Spent the rest of the day wandering the city. Drove to Ocean Beach and read. Drove to Starbucks and read. Drove back to the 'rents and read. Fell asleep.

Saturday: So DT's wedding was in Oakland. Bay Bridge was closed. The decision was made not to go to the wedding. So just spent the afternoon reading. Missed Maeva's red egg & ginger party because I forgot to RSVP. Although I did get shit on Sunday for missing it. The wedding banquet was at Yank Sing in the Rincon Center. I can't remember the food that much. Let's just say I got to see the food twice that night and leave it at that. We hung out with a bunch of 30 year-olds that acted like they were in their 20s. Had a lot of fun that night. The awkwardness that I was anticipating did not materialize. It was good to see him again after all these years. The alcohol really took the edge off. Went to a place called Loft 46 afterwards on Maiden Lane. Called it the evening around 2am and headed home.

Sunday: Slept in and then went out to Hong Kong Flower Lounge in Millbrae for dimsum with the 'rents and sibs. It was good to see the kidlets. I do miss them a lot. I can't believe the oldest is already 7 going on 8. Time really flies. So just the normal weekend dimsum food and then headed out to the Millbrae Art & Wine Festival. We just walked around and didn't do much. But it was fun hanging out with the family. Headed to Hillsdale to do some shopping before going to meet up with the girls for dinner at CreoLA in San Carlos. Had Shrimp CreoLa, Crawfish Hushpuppies, Sunday Chicken, and Jambalaya. The food was pretty good. The hushpuppies were TDF (to-die-for). Got to play with Reed and Maeva for a bit. Had Deb's b-day cake by the fire pit in J&P's backyard. Drove home without my glasses because I left it at my 'rents on Friday night. Not fun, let me tell ya. 

Monday: 'Rents drove us to the airport early so that we can avoid traffic and lines, because the bridge is still closed. Had a breakfast panini at CPK in the airport. It was good enough for airport food. Got home before noon and I've been kinda fartin' around since then. I get to do that packing thing all over again tomorrow 'cause I leave for HK/Japan early Friday morning, as in 1:50 am morning. I guess all international asian flights are like that. 

So...short story long. That was my weekend in a rather large nutshell. I hope to have more during the trip. I will be tweeting whenever I find wi-fi access. Keeping fingers crossed that wi-fi is a'plenty in Tokyo."

"event","I've had my maroon Corolla for 10 years, going on 11 at the end of this year. I've never financed a car in my life before. My parents chose the Corolla and I paid them back for it in 9 months after getting my first real job out of college. I was living at home at the time, so it made the paying off part a lot quicker and interest-free. 

So when it came time to take the plunge at the dealership this weekend. I was beyond nervous. I had gone to look at cars the previous weekend at Penske in West Covina. We were approached immediately by a salesman. We took a quick test-drive. He couldn't answer any of our question, barely knew his cars, and the only thing he tried to sell us on was the cool talking multi-media system. He couldn't guarantee any price. He was looking to rip us off royally. The slimeball's name was Shane. He gave me a call that same afternoon, but never followed up with a lower offer. So I thumb my nose at him when I say, I fucking bought my car at Mercedes of Anaheim you son-of-a-bitch and I loved every moment of it. F-U-Penske Mercedes! You need to hire better salespeople. 

I had a wonderful experience at Mercedes of Anaheim...as the hubs calls it...The Mercedes Experience. They make you feel special. They make you want to buy a car from them just because they make you feel so darn good. They may even rip you off a little, but they even make you feel good about that. Shelly, our sales guy, was amazing. He really took care of us. From the moment we drove into the dealership (he spotted us on the way in and met us at the front of the building) until the moment he waved goodbye to us, I felt like I was special. He took the time to show every car we asked to see, never rushing us. We even drove across the freeway to the other lot. He let us test-drive as many cars as we wanted. In the end we decided on the C350. Actually, the hubs decided on the C350, I would have been perfectly happy with the C300. The negotiating part took a bit of time. Going back and forth on the price that in the end we were almost nickel and diming it. We settled on a price we could live with. I was so nervous the whole time, that I couldn't sit still. My hands were shaking uncontrollably. It was the biggest purchase I've ever made besides the house. But that took almost a month to deal with, this was a few hours. 

So after profusely thanking me and taking my picture with my new car, Shelly said goodbyes to us and we were on our way back home with my new baby, Bella a.k.a Batmobile a.k.a Pretty Pretty.

Hopefully the hubs is up for going to the dealership with me 'cause I know I sure as hell can't wheel and deal on my own. Wait a tick...I probably could, but prefer not to.

Crossing my fingers that this will actually happen.

For some of my friends they'll say ""It's about damn time you've traded up."" But for others, it will come as a shock because I'm usually so practical. Practicality aside, I have lived with one vehicle for more than 10 years. If I have to live with another car for the next 10 years, I'd prefer it be a pretty one. My parents kind of picked and chose my last one without consulting me until they had paid for it. Mind you, I have paid every cent of that car back to them NINE months after they paid for it. How's that for financing? I just knew I had pay off the 'rents and not have that debt hanging over my head.

I've transferred the down payment to my checking account. I've called the insurance company to make sure I have coverage (30 days baby!). So here goes nothing! Leap of faith! (Kinda like Bella cliffdiving)"

"event","After spending most of my morning tweeting and accomplishing not much other than the 5-minute chocolate cake, I drove out to Valencia to meet my friend's (D&F) newborn baby, Maeva. 

I don't have kids and don't intend to have any. I'm really good with my nieces and nephews because I am their crazy aunt that likes to torment the crap out of them. That's why they love me. But it is different because they are blood and I can do that kind of stuff. But I digress.

Maeva was born on March 19, 2009 at 8:47 am. She's a tiny little baby and still has the fur on her. She barely fits her car seat, let alone her baby clothes. We went on a little adventure to Corner Bakery to get a late lunch. She slept through the whole thing. Here's a pic of her doing that ""call me"" gesture with her tiny little hand:

She is a very sweet little thing with a nice set of lungs made especially for screaming while being changed. I walked her to sleep in my arms. I love other people's kids because I know at the end of the day, I don't have to live my life in three hour blocks and can sleep through the night without having to wake up to crying. I can't take the stress of having a little one to take care of and nurture. I'm not cut from the same fabric as a lot of my friends. I just want to live life without the attachments. On rare moments, like the one tonight, I felt like I may have been swayed in the other direction just a little. Just a tiny moment. An infinitesimal second. Nothing more."

"event","I'm always skeptical of things that sound too good to be true. One of my twitter friends (green_i_girl) tweeted this recipe for 5-minute chocolate cake on April Fool's day. So that made me even more wary. She said her mom gave her the recipe. Skepticism aside, I decided to give it a go. I followed the recipe from this website: http://www.dizzy-dee.com/recipe/chocolate-cake-in-5-minutes

This is how it turned out:
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/000025b7/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/feiticeira75/pic/000025b7/s320x240"" width=""180"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

The cake rose out of the cup like a volcano and scared the living daylights out of me. I thought it was going to explode. Once it reached its final ascent, it stayed at the same height the remainder of the three minutes *wiped sweat from brow* 

The verdict: The cake was a little dry. Tasted kind of like brown dough. For those Chinese readers out there, I compare this to a chocolate man-tou. Maybe it's because I used all-purpose flour instead of cake flour. I also forgot to add in the chocolate chips. I'm already thinking of ways this recipe can be improved. Sour cream usually does a good job of moistening up a cake. Also adding some instant coffee granules could bring out more of the chocolate flavor. All in all, I still think this recipe is a WIN. It didn't blow up and the resultant cake was edible. So when desperate times call for desperate measures, you might want to give this a try as a quick fix to your chocolate cake cravings. Now give me a 5 minute frosting recipe and I'm set."

"event","So I was one of the crazies that decided to watch the Twilight movie midnight on opening day. I can tell you it was a once in a lifetime experience. I have never gone as far as to watch a movie the day it came out, nothing has ever quite caught my fancy the way Twilight has. When will Twilight ever open in the theaters for the first time again? Never. I am part of that piece of Twilight history-making and I can keep that with me forever. 
First and foremost, the movie was absolutely amazing. You have to take into account that $37 Million is not going to buy you the top-of-the-line visual effects from ILM. You have to watch it with an open mind. Remember the characters and see how well cast that each person is. How perfectly, strategically each song is placed in a scene. It was magic. 
The beginning of the movie was at times cheesy and sappy with lines drawn straight from the book that sound cheesy even in print, let alone having it actually come out of someone's mouth. IMHO, the movie had the proper amount of cheese factor to keep the film light and quick-moving. There was not enough of the building up of the characters, but I read the books so that was not entirely necessary, but I can see how the Twilight novice might have a hard time keeping up with the pace of the movie because it skips ahead so quickly. Half an hour in I think we're already at the meadow scene (I didn't check my watch at all the entire movie). 
Rob Pattinson (Edward) did an wonderful job as Edward. I thought he was believable playing my favorite vampire. He looked like he was about to puke at times. I guess that may be the only way to show you are tortured, having inner-conflict with good and bad duking it out in your head. My friend made a comment about how he looks really good at the end. That's when it all clicked. Midnight Sun from Edward's perspective explains this phenomenon from a ghastly pale immortal to someone almost ""human."" I am pretty sure that this was the effect they intended on and they pulled it off seamlessly.
When I first listened to the soundtrack I thought it was good but it didn't make much sense. After watching the movie it makes perfect sense. I was thinking that this should have been a musical because of the perfectly placed song for each scene. I am absolutely in love with the soundtrack and have been listening to it on repeat at the office. 
All in all, if you are looking for a light-hearted, romance movie this is it. You need to have read the first book at least, otherwise you will be wondering why the dialogue sounds so strange (cheeseball). Some of the special effects leave a lot more to be desired, but most fangirls, like myself, aren't looking for that anyway. Not the best movie ever, but may move into one of the top spots when it comes out on DVD. 
Summit is going to make a killing on this movie and New Moon is going to be made a reality. The experience of watching it at midnight made the movie all the more memorable. I can't wait to see it again today with my coworkers. This time I can actually give it my full attention. Because I won't be assessing whether or not I like the movie. That is a given. The pressure is off and I can just sit back and be dazzled.

Update: Twilight is definitely in my Top Ten favorite films of all times. How did that happen? I love the book adaptation, the music, the cast, the camera-work, the everything. Congrats to Twilight for a great opening weekend! Am super-stoked that New Moon has been green-lighted by Summit."

I called AAA for the first time (yes, there was a second time this evening) They came pretty quickly. The tow truck guy jumped my car and everything seemed hunky dory. I left the CSUF parking lot and drove to the Shell station about 3 miles from my house to get gas. My car was running on fumes so I decided to stop off and get some gas, thinking my battery should be charged up by all that freeway driving. So I turned on my engine and pumped the gas. Get back in the car, crank the engine...nothing. I called Connie to ask her to bring jumper cables. Aaron ended up coming since he had tools and could fix something on the fly if necessary. So we hooked up the jumper cables, car turned on and removed the jumper cables and the car went dead. Tried it a few more times. Dead dead dead. 
Called AAA a second time asked for somebody to bring a new battery. Obviously at this time of the night, no one sells batteries. Not even Walmart Supercenter, which wouldn't answer my phone call BTW. Much time passes and Aaron and I kill time by chitchatting about Simpsons, Futurama, Southpark, Family Guy and American Dad. ProTowing shows up and hooks up the new battery...guess what? It's dead dead dead. So I started to really worry. Worrying continued for awhile. What if I need to buy a new car? The AAA guy put back my old battery and cranked the engine and miracle of miracles it worked. He took off the battery and my engine was still running, alternator is still good. They think it was the contacts and the corrosion and the water in the battery was low. That's the end of my story. I drove home with Aaron following to make sure I got home intact and it is now almost 2 am. I am so glad that someone was there for me when I needed them most. Thanks Aaron and thanks AAA. Truly wonderful people and my angels. 
I think I used up my quota for AAA callouts for the year in one evening. Holy crap!"

I thoroughly enjoyed the first 12 chapters of Midnight Sun. I didn't even know it was virally distributed until I visited her website yesterday morning checking for updates. I guess it wasn't that viral?
The book stopped off two days before the Meadows scene. I was reading both Twilight and Midnight Sun concurrently, comparing all the nuances between the two point of views. Didn't quite get to the second day in biology class with the ""electricity"" stuff. :)
I look forward to her finishing up the book. It was a violation of her trust when the partial draft was leaked. But I believe that she will one day continue the Edward saga. She has too many of us hanging on with baited breath. In the meantime...I can wait...it's totally worth it.

I remember this song playing on my Singapore Airlines flight to Hong Kong when I was 16. I also had this song on a tape I listened to on my Sony Walkman that my sister bought for me for my birthday. The memories of listening to this song are still very vivid in my normally fuzzy memory. It really does seem like yesterday when I was hanging with my big sis in the hotel room in Shatin, with my parents staying in the next room over. I remember how much I wanted to go downstairs and buy ice cream after hearing the Jacky Cheung song ""Loving You More Everyday"" in an ice cream commercial. I can't believe that was half my life ago. Back then, I could put a song to a particular year based on what significant events happened during that time, like ""That song was popular in 1992 during the Monte Carlo school dance."" Now everything is all jumbled up into a decade. ""That song was popular in the early 2000s.""
Another song that I kept hearing while in Hong Kong was Paula Abdul's ""Rush Rush.""

We arrived there fashionably late, not by choice, but because I had to talk D into going out to dance off the pizza we ate for dinner. The parking lot attendants could not speak a lick of English, they openly admitted to it as they said, ""No English."" We lined up to buy tickets for the club, but there was apparently no line per se, it was whichever group they felt like letting in. So D went up to the girl and asked her how we could get in. The chick had this fake high voice which sounded like nails on a chalkboard to me. Her overuse of the word ""honey"" was utterly annoying. D lied to her and said that there was a group of people on the other side with us and tried to get them in. Fake blonde chick asked how many, D started counting heads and the chick said, ""you're lying to me, lying is a no-no."" Somehow we managed to not get ourselves kicked out of line. 
Once in the club we tried to get drinks, nasty and very expensive drinks. One jager redbull and one redbull costs $17 before tip. The drink was really watered down because the redbull was not chilled and melted all the ice. That was the only drink I bought that night.  Getting wasted would have put me in the poorhouse...might have had to take out a loan. The music at the club was all over the place; one second it would be hiphop, the next second 80s, and the next second rap. No song played quite long enough to get into it. But the song of the night was ""Crazy"" by Gnarls Barkley, the only halfway decent song in my book. Too many scummy guys trying to talk and/or grope. 
At some point in the night, an extremely drunk short chick decided that my foot would be a great place to grind her heel into. I knew she was drunk because I saw her stumbling back to her group of friends immediately following her assault of my foot. Her heel had dug through my jeans and broke skin on the top of my foot. My initial reaction was ""WTF"" and then there was the onset of sharp pain coursing through me which render me motionless until the pain subsided. Once I was able to speak again, I told D that I needed to get off the dancefloor, ""NOW!"" My foot is still swollen and though the area has not turned black and blue, it remains an unhealthy pink hue. Needless to say the rest of the night was not very fun. We met an obnoxious 43 year old guy who kept talking and talking and talking.  Deb and I were making signals to each other by pulling our earlobe ala Natalie Portman in Garden State. It was funny because we were having a good laugh at the guy's expense and he had not a clue. We left the club after 2 am. And suffice it to say...we will never be back. 
I was so stand-offish and aloof the entire night that the following day I was still acting out. While shopping at Trader Joe's in Santa Clarita, some lady bumped my cart on purpose and asked me if I could move it. She could have just as easily asked me to move my cart without bumping it, but she didn't, so my reaction was to pull my cart away very quickly and abruptly. ""Crazy asian girl"" she must have been thinking to herself. In another aisle I was looking at pasta and a girl asked me to move my cart out of the way. So I quickly grabbed a bag of pasta and slammed it into my cart...hard. I think she gave me a weird look and check for signs of anger on my face. If you know me, I can be seething on the inside and still be in cool, calm, and collect mode on the outside. So I fled Santa Clarita and drove back to Chino Hills where the people don't have the holier-than-thou attitude. Too bad Chino Hills doesn't have a Trader Joe's."

"event","can not wait until my trip to europe next week. can not believe i am actually going to london and paris for a one week getaway. lot of time spent traveling on planes and trains, but i don't care. i can not get away soon enough from the bullshit at work. i have so much to do though, so it doesn't help that our admin support sucks right now. they hate us because my coworker and i got moved to the window seats and  kicked out one of their own. so for the last few days all we get are dirty looks and we hear not a peep from them. we've been so afraid of asking them for help that we've resorted to doing the tedious tasks ourselves. i won't even go to them to ask for more request for leave forms. kind of ironic since i need those forms to get me far away from them. 
my coworker sylvie is starting her three week vacation tomorrow. but i will see her next week to firm up plans of meeting in paris. that will be so awesome seeing familiar faces in a place thousands of miles away from Chino Hills. it doesn't quite feel real yet that i'm going so far away. my last real vacation was three years ago. so this trip is long awaited and long overdue. for so long i have been waiting to go somewhere, do something, and for once i am doing something for myself. i've worked so hard the last few years that i know i deserve this break. all i do is work and save money like the responsible person i am, but never have a chance to enjoy spending the money. even for this trip i have been damning the pound sterling and the euro because of the currency conversion being not in my favor. maybe next time i will go to a place where the US dollar is stronger. but hell, i guess i'll just have to suck it up and take it up the you know what. i can't wait for my vacation to begin. just one more week."

"event","I was sitting in Union Square over the weekend, minding my own business. I had tripped on the street crossing the intersection between Macy's and Union Square about an hour earlier. So I sat there nursing my wounds and my ego...it was an embarassing fall. I sat on the tiny corner of some concrete slab, watching the crowd go by, and reading my London and Paris guidebooks. I rather like people watching. I think that's what exactly what I'll do in London/Paris. Just watch the grass grow for once and not be in so much of a damn hurry all the time.

So my awkward situation stemmed from a brief encounter with a guy that comes up to me as I'm digging through my purse. He walked up to me and said, ""I just wanted to tell you that you are the prettiest girl I've seen all day."" Dead air. ""Thanks,"" I finally responded with a smile. He wasn't creepy looking or anything...just a regular kind of guy. My first thought was that this was the guy who saw me fall on the street earlier. But how stalkerazzi would that be for him to hang around for an hour? My second thought was that this was a psychology study. How to make someone feel really awkward and how long it takes for them to recover? But maybe it was just what it was. A simple explanation. Just one human being saying kind words to another. Sometimes I really do believe words speak louder than actions."

"event","I guess I am officially registered now to do the Nike Half Marathon in SF on October 22. I think Spao will be going with me and my friend Jen, as well. It should be fun. Even if I end up crawling to the finish line, I intend to finish.  You get a Tiffany & Co. finishers necklace at the end of the race.  That's incentive enough to do the race. Anyways, I paid my registration fees and all I need to do is make sure I book an airplane ticket for that weekend. And in the meantime, I gotta make sure I hit the gym consistently and train outdoors. No iPod allowed on the race course...that sucks."

"event","this is how much i trust my coworkers. at least i trust that they aren't going to poison me, at least not in the near-term. i found a chocolate and i ate it, unaware to who had placed the chocolate on my mouse. i'm so trusting of them. i find sandwiches on my chair. brownies on my keyboard. never once do i consider where the unknown food as come from before i take my first bite. after the initial bite i think to myself, maybe i should find out. eh! i'm too lazy to find out. i have a fairly short list of potential food-leaving people, so i just assume it's one of them. if there's one way to get to me, it's through food. i'm glad this isn't the shakespearean times where the pick of poison was poison. i would have been dead a long time ago. i prefer death by chocolate."

"event","I've been a bit neglectful about posting over the holidays...but I've been putting the time to good use.  Really.

First, I've finally gotten my groove back.  My good news from just before Christmas was good, but it still took a few days to get the meds out of my system, resulting in me not being the most sparkly character over the holiday.  I'm now *ahem* (at the risk of offering TMI) ""regular"" again.  Praise to jeebus!  I appreciate little things like this.

I've been doing something over December that I've never had to do before over my 22 years if the Guv'mint:  USE ""use or lose"" leave.  Over this near-quarter century, I've had many people quibble with me over the relatively low pay I got as a civil servant (it took 20 years for me to go from a starting salary of $15K to breaking six figures)...the trade-offs I got though were a) job security, b) good health insurance (they added dental and vision about 10 years ago), and c) good sick leave and annual leave (the latter being ""vacation) time), 240 hours of annual leave can be carried over from one calendar year to the next.  Twelve years ago, I was around long enough to start earning 8 hours of annual leave for every 2-week pay period...and I promptly used it.  Flexiplace and maxiflex means that I haven't been using leave like I was...and just before Thanksgiving, I discovered that I HAD to use 40 hours of annual leave in December, or I would be over the maximum 240 hour carry-over and I would lose a week's worth of vacation time.  I've used it now.

I went into the office Tuesday, and was handed a hand-written note left by my acting (""temporary"") branch chief...I was to move from the dank, dark, airless cubicle I've spent the last 15 years calling my office...into a newly-assigned window cubicle.  I had Tuesday to move all but my desktop and telecom, which our information management people should have done now.  When I go into the office for the first time in 2010, I will be in a spot where I can look out my windows down onto Clark Street and the Chicago Board of Trade, watch the peregrine falcons that live on the Federal Metropolitan Correctional Center next door carry on the feather-exploding slaughter of airborne pigeons and tear the squabs into bloody little bits to feed their chicks in their jail nest, and have an incredible view of the city stretching southwest--with incredible sunsets and the awe of weather systems sweeping inexorably northeast toward the Lake.  I will have...REAL light--something incredible for the depression-prone--and cell phone reception that is perplexingly absent only 20 feet away.  This is a big deal for me.  I've earned it.

Wednesday morning brought a guy from the North Shore suburbs (and his Ford Aerostar-driving little brother) who disassembled the old home gym and carted it out of my bedroom within 90 minutes.  I have SPACE!  I can access my closet again!  I can clean up hidden cat-pukes and battle the killer dustbunnies!  So I vacuumed...cleaned the carpet...moved my bed so that nosey neighbors can't see me nekkid in bed if I leave my blinds cracked open.  I've cleaned out my closet and taken a huge load of clothes I haven't worn in years (like 4 suits and a dozen ties...but I've kept SOME anyhow) to the Howard Brown Elephant re-sale shop...I've tossed old jockstraps with no elasticity, old toys that melted in storage, found things that haven't seen the light of day in 12 years.  I re-arranged my bedroom, created a reading nook in one corner by the big window, opened up HUGE floor space, and even de-cluttered my living room in the process.  This is BIG progress...and another big change to go along with a new direction in my life.

And I said ""NO"" to someone earlier in the week...for all the right reasons.  A guy from Champaign, who has occasionally chatted with me on the 411 site for 5 or 6 years but never showed up in person, once again said (out of the blue) that he'd like to stop by sometime to check out a specially-constructed hole in a wall of mine (one at crotch level that somehow used to have turgid male anatomy poking through at me from time to time).  I thought it odd that he brought this up, since I have had no mention of the facility on that site for quite some time...and it hasn't been put to use in about a year...but he said he would be making the trip here to Chicago more often, since he's DATING someone here now.  Then he mentioned that his boyfriend might like to come along...they've had ONE date.  I suggested that perhaps a) he might want to read my profile again (it's at http://www.bear411.com/envirobear or http://www.bigmusclebears.com/~envirobear ) and b) he should keep it between his new boyfriend and himself.  His response:  Oh, my boyfriend might really like to come, too.  My reply:  ""Do you have any SINGLE friends?  Tell them to contact me if they like my profile.""

Gary and Eric were very proud of me having said that.  I have to make 2010 a year of new beginnings and new approaches...yes, I love sex, but what good is it for me if the only men I meet are ONLY into me for sex before they go home to their own partners?  I can love a guy as a friend...but that doesn't mean that he's going to get ""benefits"" unless--UNLESS--he's talking about introducing me to another friend who's also single and dating.  If you get to go home and go to bed with your partner after you've played with me...then I *expect* that you think enough of me as a friend that you're going to want ME to have the equal pleasure of being able to turn out the lights at night with someone who values me as much as you value your own partner.  If you're single, you have no further obligation...but if you're partnered and want to play with me--have a name and info about a single friend before your peen has pleasure...I expect an introduction somehow BEFORE we play again.  *GRIN*  Not too much to ask, really.

So that's what I've been doing...and where I'm going.  I'm making concrete changes to my surroundings, and focusing on where I want to go THIS YEAR.  No more ""giving it up"" unless there's something in it for ME...streamlining my life, taking care of me first instead of taking care of everyone else and THEN me...getting back into circulation...letting someone work a bit to snare me because I'm *worth* the effort.  Next up:  clear out more clutter, get the guest room ready to rent, meet more of the LJers and FBers who are local or visiting--like <lj user=""allanh"">, visiting from the Bay Area--and try to make inexpensive plans to see friends on both coasts over the next year.

So a belated Happy New Year to you all...I hope 2010 is a more prosperous and successful year for everyone--including me."

"event","Some of you may have read my <a href=""http://envirobear.livejournal.com/121442.html"">late World AIDS Day post</a>, where I mentioned that I had been potentially exposed to HIV by getting dicked by a poz man--with a 0-gauge P.A.--where the rubber broke and I got a full load of cum where the sun doesn't shine.  As a result, my doctor put me on ""emergency"" treatment--the same as healthcare professionals who get accidental needle-sticks--800 mg/day of Kaletra (Lopinavir/Ritonavir) and 300 mg/day of Combivir (lamivudine/zidovudine).  This is not the ""easy"" stuff...and it's not low-dosage, either...it gives you headaches, muscle aches, makes you constantly nauseated wanting to throw up, gives you frequent (and urgent) diarrhea, *excessive* gas, severe indigestion, and it's hard on your liver.  I won't go into the gory details (unfortunately, too many of you already have had to go through them yourselves), but suffice to say that I've been fortunate to be able to take time off work in order to stay close to the facilities...and I cancelled holiday plans with my family because of that problem.

I just got off the phone with my doctor...the last round of testing came back with an undetectable viral load, which means that I can toss the rest of the Kaletra and Combivir, and get back to a settled life.  I am still HIV-negative...that's cause for me to be grateful, and having a Merry Christmas IS about not feeling sick.  Like I said in my previous post on the subject, this emergency treatment is not a substitute for playing safely--to say it's unpleasant is a huge understatement--but IT'S AVAILABLE.  And I'll repeat that if I love a man enough to be intimate with him, HIV is not an issue--but I expect him to respect MY health and well-being as much as I respect his.  Please remember all of that, if not for yourself, then for friends you care about.  And Happy Holidays to each of you.

"event","Anyone who reads this knows that something happened over the past few weeks that has me back in the ""dating pool"" again...the situation got very complicated, and I take responsibility for my own actions that contributed to the complications.  I also said in my last post on the subject that it is past history, and I mean that.  Good intentions won't do any more good--sometimes they can be like picking scabs off old wounds--so please, no more.  What's done is done, old adversaries will remain unanswered, and those involved have moved on to new challenges and opportunities.  End of story.  Period.

World AIDS Day was Tuesday.  There were many thoughtful and thought-instigating entries about it from a range of people impacted directly and indirectly by HIV.  And I wanted to do an entry myself, but couldn't manage to frame it the way I wanted while I was also staying up to put together a presentation in front of 150 people the next day.  And I wasn't feeling too great either...let's just say that I have a far better understanding now of what some people live with.  Here's why.

I've never had any issues being involved romantically with men living with HIV.  Now that I'm dating again, that is front-and-center once more, since so many gay men who are serious about dating happen to be HIV-positive.  I started chatting with a guy from A Bear Website who fully-disclosed his status, knew that I had a negative antibody test some months ago, and we decided to have a date on Sunday.  I met him--and he informed me he already ate dinner; he didn't want to see a movie afterall, and my paltry collection of DVDs didn't appeal.  He made it clear that he wanted one thing, despite my attempt to take a different approach this time:  he wanted some booty.  I've gotten dicked by other men with P.A.'s, so we rolled a rubber over his 0-gauge, and along we went.  It didn't take him long before he came...then we discovered that the rubber...BROKE.  Full butt-load of cum.  He was beside himself.  I wound up comforting *HIM*.  I saw him off the next morning and went to see my doctor.  I'm now taking full-dosage prescriptions of Kaletra and Combivir as a prophylactic through December.  The RNA testing came back today--negative.  I go back in two and a half weeks from now for a follow-up test, and if it's still negative (since I was put on medication less than 24 hours after potential exposure), then chances are very good that there either was no transmission or that the medications stopped it along with my own immune response.

The lessons I'm learning from this?  NEVER again will I get dicked by a guy wearing a P.A.  It comes out if dick is going in.  The medication is a life saver, yes, but I have a newfound appreciation for the immediate side-effects that anyone taking it has to deal with--it is NOT pleasant, and it's hard on your system.  ""The Day After"" pills are an emergency treatment, full-dosage with no ramping-up, and VERY costly--nearly $500 for a month's supply, *after* my very good insurance paid for three-quarters of the cost--so this is no more a substitute for playing responsibly than abortion is a contraceptive...the physical and financial costs are just too great.  But it's *available* when all else fails.

I'm respectful from this experience, and I'm not *looking* for seroconversion.  I'm looking for someone who has the right blend of personality, character, and attraction...regardless of his sero-status or age or any other set of variables.  And I have managed to be very sexual for 25 years with many poz men, without incident until now.  That is something I want my readers to carry away as my World AIDS Day message--don't stop living a full life because of having HIV or NOT having HIV...and don't let sero-status be a qualification for who you love or who you let love you.  Living life is about taking risks every day, and many of us take the words of Shelby in ""Steel Magnolias"" to heart:  ""I would rather have thirty minutes of wonderful than a lifetime of nothing special.""  I'm a diabetic too."

"event","Green-shirt Thursdays.  White-brief Wednesdays.  And all the rest.  What do you do if you don't look good in green?  How can you do underwear if you haven't owned any (besides jockstraps) in 30 years?  That was the question I posed to <lj user=""major7""> when he did one last week...then he became a Muse...LOL

You may have an aversion to wearing anything green...you may wear boxers instead of briefs, or you may be like me and go ""commando""...the point of ""Freeballing Fridays"" is that *anyone* can do it (even though you may be bashful).  Here's the plan:  on Fridays, you need to go commando, aka ""freeball"", aka ""no underwear or jockstrap between you and your pants/shorts/kilt/etc""...take a photo (or have a photo taken) of you, showing that you're freeballing (you can show as much or as little of your junk as you want, just show that you're wearing *nothing* under your pants or shorts!), and post it to YOUR journal with ""Freeballing Friday"" somewhere in your subject line!  If you're showing more than a glimpse of your naughty bits, you know to put it behind an LJ cut...and get your friends to participate, OK?  Copy as much as you want of this post, or link to it if you wish--this one will be UNlocked.

"event","Last night, <lj user=""furrbear""> steered me to a raging discussion flying around about President Obama and a Justice Department filing on DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act)...mostly based on extremely poor reporting and intentional flaming by John Aravosis' ""Americablog"" (no, I'm not providing a link to something that would not have gotten a passing mark on content and supporting references as a 200-level university term paper).  I rarely get pissed off to the point of being livid, but Aravosis picked out the points he was trying to score, ignored half of the story, failed to provide background or even explain what he suddenly declared himself to be a legal expert on, and continued to be a single-issue tantrum thrower, not in the least unlike the ultra-conservative Xtian right-wing that we JUST pushed to the sidelines eight months ago.  And picture this:  You are invited by a good friend to a 7-course dinner he's doing as his final exam on his culinary degree, and you are to rate the dinner...you wander through the kitchen while he's working, eat a colorful plate of julienne vegetables which is absolutely foul, and you fail him before you've even sat down for the meal he's still working hard on.  Then you discover that you barged in at your own direction and what YOU thought was a julienne salad was actually the *vegetable peelings*, ready to be disposed, never intended to be eaten, never part of the meal.  Aravosis ate the peelings, and he has already failed Chef Obama over having peeled the vegetables and over taking his time to cook the meal *right* (instead of tossing the raw ingredients on your table and declaring dinner having been served!).  I'm furious at Aravosis insulting my intelligence like this--and yours, and the President's.  And while I understand the anger and indignation of those of you who DOMA and other marriage issues impact directly right now, YOU have to understand that nothing is gained by charging in, half-assed and unprepared, without having done sufficient homework and without having laid an adequate foundation.  I've read a few of you saying that your contributions to the Obama-Biden campaign were a waste because you ""did not get what you thought you paid for""...my response is that I donated to the ""No on Prop 8"" campaign (which was obviously fucked up and poorly-run) even though I am not a Californian and had no possibility of a no-vote benefitting me directly...I have NOT demanded my money back.  But you should know from the results that it's easier and more effective to do something right from the beginning (and see it through to the right conclusion) than it is to fix something that has been fucked up over sloppiness and impatience.

Before you write another word, I encourage you to read entries on this blow-up by <lj user=""bear_left""> <a href=""http://bearleft.blogspot.com/2009/06/dont-moan-organize.html"">here</a>, and <lj user=""joeatlarge""> <a href=""http://joeatlarge.livejournal.com/258419.html"">here</a>.  They do stellar jobs of explaining what happened and suggesting what we can do besides blow hot air, wring our hands, and insult those who don't deserve to be insulted.  I also want to suggest that you read <a href=""http://shelbycub.livejournal.com/361076.html"">this entry</a> by <lj user=""shelbycub"">, because if I *ever* hear of someone on my LJ friends list pulling crap like the Far Right has done to enforce lemming-like orthodoxy within our communities, I will show up on your doorstep and knock your teeth out of your stupid head before I remove you from my friends list.  The sort of behavior that <lj user=""shelbycub""> had imposed on him has NO PLACE IN OUR COMMUNITY, otherwise, we are no better than Dobson, the Mormons, and the American ""Family"" Association.  Get off your asses and do something constructive like <lj user=""bear_left""> suggests--or even visit the White House website to *E-MAIL* your opinion on what you'd like the President to be doing--instead of doing whispering campaigns as if your best friend has stolen last week's boyfriend from you.

I won't presume that I've written anything significant here, but if you are public-minded enough to want to pass the links on to others, the entry is public (unlocked)."

"event","There was once a young woman who lived on the shores of the Black Sea.  She was a strong and athletic woman; had the Olympics not been set aside because of war, her times were enough to ensure a bronze medal in the 100-meter backstroke.  But her strength was both a blessing and a curse...it saved her life, but it also guaranteed this 19-year old woman a post-invasion relocation from her native Soviet Union to Germany as a ""guest laborer"".  She got into fights with her taskmistress there, went without meals often, used rubbing alcohol and cheap perfume for deodorant, met a handsome Polish P.O.W. and kept him alive by passing part of her meager rations through a fence to him.  When the war ended, they married, had a son, and because they would have been shot if they went to Stalin's Soviet Union or to Soviet-occupied Poland, they sailed across the Atlantic to make new lives in a small Michigan town with a name familiar to her from her old home in Ukraine:  Alma.  They added two more sons and a daughter, gained U.S. citizenship, ran a small electrician business, and she started teaching the entire town to swim.

That's how I first met Klara. I was 8 years old, terrified of the deep end of the high school pool (because I couldn't put my feet on the bottom), and this towering, intimidating woman with a funny accent and a one-piece swimming suit with a flounce, took me on alone.  ""DARlink,"" she said, ""what is it that makes you not want deep end?  Look.  I am here in deep end.  You can do swimmingk without touch bottom in shallow end, yes?  No different here, my love.  I will stay here, you will swim.  Come, let us practice in deep end.""  This woman who had a reputation for being crude and blunt gained the trust and admiration of my parents...and me.  Not only did I swim in the deep end, I eventually was coached by her in swim club, I took lifesaving classes from her, and Water Safety Instructor classes from her, as well.  She became my boss and friend; I became her ""victim"" for other lifesaving classes, her friend, and her deputy.  She invited me to their home on hot summer days for fresh cold borscht; I drove her home in bad weather so she wouldn't have to bicycle home in a storm.  I filled in for her by opening the college pool and sitting on deck for lap swimmers, she brought two slices of hot pizza for us on her way over to relieve me (""DARLINK! How could you not like ANCHOVY? Anchovy DELICIOUS! Very well, give to me, I vill eat.  Sheesh...not like anchovy..."").  I ordered layered tortes from her every Christmas...and when I stopped by to pick them up, I graciously declined her offers to share whole salted herrings with her.  She asked about my college classes; I explained to her why the evolutionary underpinnings of my biology major classes and her recently-discovered evangelism didn't have to be mutually exclusive.

I have many vivid memories of her...floating like a cork in a seated upright position with arms and legs crossed, lecturing from the pool to a college P.E. student who was learning that a funny accent didn't equate with ""stupid""...seeing her sweep in during a blizzard, wearing her long brown leather coat with its big fur collar and matching hat, cold blue eyes blazing, breath puffing past ruddy red cheeks, and smile on her face with her big purse swinging from her fingertips...walking into a darkened natatorium to open up for the public and finding her in the water wearing nothing but her bra and panties....and lots of humor about her ample BOSOM.  She once told me that she had to special-order a new bathing suit because she needed something with a skirt that could fit her tall powerful build, because, afterall, ""I am a Large Busted RRRRRRussian Woman,""...and I joked that she needed steel reinforcement for her 48 double-D's, too.  Once, when I was lifeguarding during lap swimming, and an equally-large-busted college junior competitive swimmer and friend of mine stopped to chat with me, Klara stooped down to the pool edge to say ""Amy, Darlink, why must a large-breasted girl like you wear the Speedo suit?  Do you not know that you could injure yourself, darlink?  You must have the breast support....""  Amy was speechless...but it was classic Klara.  And finally, she had me demonstrating on-deck to one of her classes how to level off a drowning victim without getting into a head-lock.  She was the ""victim"", lecturing to the class how I pulled her around by the arm and blocked further turning from the shoulder, and what happened when you failed to do that block.  She put me into a head-lock with my face buried in her cleavage and continued to lecture and ask questions of her students...until she realized that I was shuddering with laughter.  ""Dean, Darlink, why are you laughing?  Dis is serious,"" she asked.  And as she released me, I managed to say between laughs, ""Klara...I COULDN'T *BREATHE*!!""  She joined me and her entire class in the giggles, and in her no-nonsense way, turned back to the teaching task at hand with a snort, a chuckle,  and ""Sheeesh...you jerk.  What you expect from large-breasted old woman?""

Mom and Dad just told me that Klara passed away in her sleep Friday, at her daughter's home, at the ripe age of 84.  This same daughter, who once had a reputation for having a white-hot eruptive temper, is now a minister and will be officiating at her funeral.  The last time I attended a funeral for an elderly lady, officiated by a Baptist-type minister, was my great-aunt's...that minister was a stand-in, but it was enough of an experience to know that I will not attend the funeral.  But I will be back in town for business on Tuesday, and the visitation is Tuesday evening...I will go to pay respects to her surviving children and grandchildren I once knew so well, and to say ""good night"" to Klara herself like I did so many times 25 years ago.  Mom and Dad will probably go with me, and there will be a flower arrangement there with this card attached:  ""Natasha, Tony, Peter, and Family-- Klara was my
teacher, my mentor, and my friend; a strong and unique woman who touched so many lives, including mine. Thank you for sharing her and her big heart with all of us. Dean W.""

I roar with laughter when I read porn that follows a plot like ""The young man had never been fucked before, but he knew that he wanted badly to feel the massive throbbing meat filling his tight hole; so he bent over and moaned in pleasure as John effortlessly slid his 10 inches of thick manhood deep into the virgin recesses...he bucked in ecstacy and met each of John's animal thrusts with an aggressive pushing back on that which impaled and stretched his inexperienced sphincter.""  PAH-LEEZE!!  I suppose that if you spent your childhood ramming a baseball bat up your butt that such stories would be feasible, but I doubt that many of us had a smile on our ashen faces the first time a dick went up our butts.

Being no exception when I was coming out in my late teens and early twenties, I felt that I could NOT be a card-carrying homosexual unless I got fucked up the butt.  And my first experiences with a big-dicked bald-headed smoker named Dwight and an oily-complexioned uncut Mexican immigrant named Javier were decidely unpleasant.  They tried and tried, but it was just too painful...Dwight even did his best to talk me thru things, but his size was not helpful, nor was the use of spit for lube and lack of the magic butt-hole relaxer we commonly call ""poppers"".  So for several years, I studiously avoided getting dicked back there but happily obliged when I was asked to provide dick to analogous anatomies.

I will start by quickly mentioning a camping trip to Saugatuck, Michigan, in the summer of 1985, where I encountered the men of the Detroit Together Men's Chorus--an organization I later sang with and briefly served as president.  Got surprised in the two-headed shower by a deep voice asking (while shampoo was in my eyes) if he could use the other shower and after saying ""SURE!"", I opened my rinsed eyes to find myself sharing the stall with a short little furball of a built Italian man named Steve....gaaaahhhhh >weak in the knees< ...and also met ANOTHER Steve with that chorus who was stuttery but fun, and easy on the eyes.  The following summer, Stuttery (but suddenly muscley) Steve invited me to drive 2 1/2 hours to Detroit to go to a gay picnic with him...we were there all day, and when we returned to his parents' home late that night, I discovered that I was *not* invited to stay for the night.  Grrrrr.  So, off I went to drive the two and one-half hours back north into rural Michigan to go home.  But being the rest area pickup guy that I was, opportunities beckoned during the wee-hour drive along the interstates.

I stopped at a rest area on I-96 about 45 minutes outside of Detroit...the place was deathly quiet, but I HAD to take a wiz.  So I whipped it out and let loose a stream at the center ADULT-height urinal and heard the doors open behind me.  Seconds later, two men were standing on either side of me...one thinner, bearded, mid-40's...the other corn-fed, mustached, early 30's.  Chit-chat.  Notice of certain motions of hand-on-dick from both.  Appearance that the younger was popping a hard-on.  Then they mentioned they were partners, lived a little ways away, would I be interested in following them home?  SURE!  No sooner had they gotten in their car and I in my pick-up then the State Police pulled in and walked quickly up into the restroom building to check for ""illicit activity""...close call, but that was fine--I was on my way to have a good time with TWO nice looking men!

So I followed them to the next exit...drove down dark twisting country roads...turned onto a gravel road and a mile or so later pulled into the driveway of a nice newer large house with a sign next to the mailbox announcing ""Cocker Spaniel Puppies For Sale"".  They invited me in, introduced themselves as Joe (the 40-something) and Casey (the 30-something).  After offering me a drink, checking the puppies and their mom, and stripping down, they explained that Casey normally bottomed for Joe, but Joe didn't like to get fucked--and Casey sometimes liked to get a piece of ass for himself.  Uh-oh.  Then I noticed that the dick I saw at the rest area urinal--that I thought was hard at the time--was NOT hard:  it just happened to be extremely large, explaining one of the reasons WHY Joe didn't like to get fucked.  Oh dear god, WHAT have I gotten myself into?  No idea where I am, on a gravel road off in the country, with TWO men who want to fuck--one with a horsedick--and I DON'T GET FUCKED.  So I hoped for the best, including the spacey idea that somehow Casey would forget that he wanted to fuck some ass.

I enjoyed being between the two of them on their high king-sized bed...Joe was a wirey and furry guy who was obviously very talented and very good looking...Casey was a solid man dusted with fur, very handsome and oozing boyish charm...and had a dick that grew to at least 9 inches and big around as a Coke can.  We played until I noticed that dawn was making the sky rosy...and I was exhausted from being up nearly 24 hours...and I suggested that I should be on my way.  They were insistent that I shouldn't go until Casey had demonstrated the pleasures of his fat cock fucking my butt...I explained that I might not be able to properly oblige.  No matter.  They tried me on my back, they tried me on my side, they tried me doggy-style, they tried me bent over the edge of the bed, they tried me face down...Casey was just TOO BIG and my sphincter had suddenly hardened its steel doors.  Then the big brown bottle of poppers came out...they laid me face down with my head in a big fluffy pillow...and the bottle of poppers screwed into my nose.  They lubed me up again and loosened things up with a good finger fuck...while I was thinking to myself ""I am a gay man...gay men get fucked up the ass...and if I can handle Casey's dick, I can handle ANY dick....""  Then I felt Casey climb between my spread legs, and felt the head of his Coke-can dick press against my poor abused butthole again.  I braced myself, took another hit of poppers, gritted my teeth, and told myself ""You can DO this...you HAVE to do this...""  Then the sharp searing pain of Casey's huge cock popping in past the taut sphincter...SCREAM...pullout pullout pullout....no, just relax...let your butt feel it inside...relax...the pain subsided a bit, and Casey began to FUCK while Joe's deep voice alternated between soothing words for me and encouragement for his lover's wild fuck.  Oh my god.  I screamed into the pillow--thank god it was there...that great fat dick kept plunging in and out of my wincing asshole...and I kept screaming...hoping that it would be over SOON...then Casey's pace picked up, pushing deeper and harder and faster into me...and he combined a groan and animal yell of release as he shot his load and collapsed on top of me.  The pain continued after he pulled out, and Joe was waiting with a hot damp washcloth to wipe down my quivering butt.  I turned down the offer of a shower and coffee as I dressed, and with their directions on how to get to the closest town and back on track to go thru Lansing for the remainder of my 90 minute drive home, I waddled into the morning sunshine in that way that someone who has just gotten thorough fucking will do, and I drove home, clenching my sphincter to lessen the pain.  Ninety minutes later, I pulled up at my apartment, got out of the pickup, and found that I had been sitting in a small pool of blood that had soaked through my jeans.  I couldn't crap for 2 days, and it was more than a week before the pain fully subsided again.

But I did it.  Casey and Joe talked me through it, and despite the torn-up butthole, they were good guys who simply were looking to each others' needs.  I happened across them for a reason...since I've rarely had trouble taking dicks of WHATEVER size since then.  I still think about them occasionally, and wish that I knew what happened to them or how to get in touch with them again...I certainly would not turn down the opportunity to get plowed again by Casey and his Coke can dick NOW.  I have my favorite dicks, including my most favorite that is attached to a particular man who will always be a red-head to me (and has a loop of steel beckoning at its head), but most others will always be measured against one that looked hard when it wasn't, grew to over 9 inches with proper stimulation, and was bigger around than a can of Coca-cola.  After all, it was the tool that confirmed to me that I *AM* a gay man...."

"event","A very wise friend once told me that friends are the family that we choose for ourselves...I've told you a bit about parts of my biological family, so let me give you some vignettes about my family of choice.

I previously mentioned Debbie (the Devil-Woman).  She's my closest friend from college, a hyperactive genius of a woman in Medieval Literature who is a wonder at fixing other people's troubles, but can't *quite* work the same majick with her own.  Speaking of majick, she's a Wiccan who will NOT eat green stuff (an occasional salad is ok, but NO veggies--fruits, nuts, berries, MEAT all are OK).  Two memories of her:  standing up in her wedding as a brides-man (yes, you read that right), joining in with the rest of the party whispering furiously at the candle-lighting part of the ceremony--with visions of white (WHITE??) veil lace going up in flames around her--""DON'T BLOW OUT THE CANDLES!!!""  One winter, I had gotten a black leather motorcycle jacket for Christmas, and wore it during a ""playful encounter"" with a guy I'd met.  We got socked by a Michigan blizzard a few days later, and I got a frantic call from Debbie, whose car had broken down on the most desolate stretch of the (really, there was a vote on this) second most boring highway in Michigan.  I drove the 30 miles to find her, picked her up and took her to the women's shelter she managed, driving very slowly thru the thickening unplowed snow.  And the next day, I picked her up again and drove her to her broken-down car, which her boyfriend from 50 miles away was working on along with her parents from 70 miles away.  I wore that leather jacket that day, and after her parents urged me back home after meeting them for that first time, I drove away and glanced down at the black leather lapel...to see a tell-tale white crusty streak which was OBVIOUSLY the remains of the recent playful encounter with the guy I'd met in Detroit.  We laughed about that, much later after the horror and embarassment--and I still get a smile on my face over her gullibility:  after explaining the concept of ""fisting"", she was thumbing thru my copy of the Advocate and asked about an ad for a leather hood.  For about 2 weeks, she actually believed that it was part of some bizaare gay ritual called ""heading""...but I take it easy on her since 3 of the 4 brothers she took as president of her soriority turned out to be GAY.  The 4th turned out to be bisexual, and is now a buddhist monk living with his male lover in New York State.  Debbie is now divorced and fending off horny 20-somethings in St. Louis.  She is no longer embarrassed by my once having to tell her ""No, that DOES fit you as a nice leather three-snap bracelet, but believe me, you DON'T want to know where I wear that.""

Margaret is my best buddy from work, my former smoking buddy who shares a bond with me over our experiences with clinical depression.  She's also Wiccan, a 70's flower child who can swear like a trooper and has a deep throaty belly laugh that just warms you to your core.  She regrets that most straight men have conversations with her ample bosom rather than with her, and her husband Howard is a stereotypical engineer--pocket-protector type and deep-thinker, although sometimes giving the appearance of being absent minded (it's a good show, but I know better--it's a ""guy thing"").  He lived alone in a gay Chicago neighborhood for many years, not realizing his surroundings, until Margaret pointed out that the reason there was so many men there and so few women was because the businesses were all GAY.  He once asked Margaret why gay men were so enthralled with big boobs if they didn't like women...I told her to tell him ""It's because we worship those things we don't understand.""  After she yelled ""Oh, you ASShole!"" at me, she let loose with a that wonderful guffawing laugh...I hit the nail on the head.  I came home feeling miserable one night, and nothing helped the increasing abdominal pain I had...so I called ""Auntie Margaret"" at 11pm to ask if she would call the next morning to see if I was home...and if I wasn't, would she come over and let Ickus outside to wet and feed the critters for me?  A sleepy greeting was immediately followed by ""WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?"" and orders to stay put--she would be over to take me to Illinois Masonic Hospital's emergency room within 10 minutes.  She dog-sat for me for several days after I had my emergency appendectomy, and even had Merry Maids come in to clean and do laundry while I was hospitalized--but she felt the need to put Post-It notes over the naughty bits of my tastefully matted-and-framed classic nekkid cowboy, pencilled by the artist Tank.  An incredible friend.  And Howard ferried me back and forth from my sleep apnea surgery, too.  She and Howard are good people, and I miss them a lot since they moved to their Wisconsin farm...with the cows, chickens, herbs....and attack geese.  Both are fluent in da CheeseSpeak dat dose Wisconsin folks communicate in, don't-cha-know, and they are happy to eat wonderful greasy cheeseburgers, BRATS (doze great Cheeseland sausages, don't-cha-know), and good Chinese and Mexican cuisine (which is NOT found readily in CheeseLand).

Gary and Eric....it seems like they have ALWAYS been part of my life.  Oddly, Eric grew up in a little town about 12 miles from where *I* grew up...and I never knew him until I was in college.  Gary grew up as an Air Force brat...a unique kid with some unusual skills.  Eric looks like the Village People biker demonically posessed by Marilyn Monroe....Gary looks like Grace Jones with a bad hormone problem.  I can't think of one without the other....and neither can Mom and Dad--Dad mixes up the two of them as badly as he does with my brother Marty and me...""Mar-Dean""....""Garic""--and despite the cricks Mom and Dad get from looking up one foot taller than they, Gary and Eric are their ""taller sons"" (Gary is sometimes referred to as their ""Darker Son"").  Eric is the kid at heart who can recite every detail on the construction and specs of the car that just flashed by, plus the play-by-play and cast and production info on nearly every movie in existence...even being the Friendly Pharmacist is a job that can be made fun with little effort--and some quirk.  Gary is intensely interested in what makes people ""tick""...he's literally and figuratively a father, who finds joy in plucking a woman's unruly eyebrows, engaging someone unusual in deep conversation, and playing with big knives, big guns, and experimental techniques and tools that will expand Eric's horizons via something painful and laughable.  They've always been there for me during good times and bad, helping me to move three times, applying their culinary skills (without red meat, thankyouverymuch, but give ME BEEF and BACON, PLEASE) at the campground and at our big dinner parties, painting ceilings and asking Dad ""So, Dad, HOW'S IT HANGING?""  Life is never dull around them, and it's frequently amusing--for example, being told by Eric to make sure I put down a good base tan before spending a week in the old 550 in Palm Springs...no problems...and continuing their vacation after I left, Eric did a clay mask on his bare scalp and promptly fell asleep poolside, getting 2nd degree sunburns that Gary said made him look like a Ferengi in Star Trek.  Not funny at the time, but the telling of the story was hilareous...and they love each other so much that Gary stayed in the guest room with a drugged-up Eric the rest of the time they were there...watching Eric drool in his fitful pain-killer-induced sleep.  There's the Little Pooter episode, which was so embarrassing for one of them that I use the story now only when I need to jerk someone's chain...ask me about it, and I *might* tell you.  And moving them from Grand Rapids, Michigan to their new home in Palm Springs...a god-awful experience of getting up at 1am to be on the road at 2am over three days drive with a caravan that included a big yellow Ryder truck and a trailered car (I *STILL* get frightened when I see those trucks, one year later).  I think they've finally figured out that there are several time changes involved, but despite the 18-hour team-driving days and 3 hour nights of sleep, we made it to the Petri Dish in the Coachella Valley of California--not TOO worse for wear--and I wouldn't dream of not helping with that move of a lifetime.  Now that their pool is almost built, I'd be happy to sleep on their pool deck--as long as Gary makes sure that the stray cat that brings him love-tokens of dead desert wildlife is chased off first.

We all have friends who came into our lives for various reasons at various times...and some weather through the ups and downs of life with us for years...and vice versa...they make us laugh, they make us cry, they make us see life through different eyes and learn that some things we thought were important AREN'T...and things we thought unimportant ARE.  They keep us true to ourselves, and true to others, and they make life always worth living.  And those people are much more than friends--they are our families of choice.  Debbie, Margaret, Howard, Eric, and Gary are mine.  Just some simple descriptives here that could never do them justice, but you've got a peek at them and why they are so important to me."

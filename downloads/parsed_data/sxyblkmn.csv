"event","so, it seems as if everyone that follows comics online or members of <lj user=""scans_daily""> are giving their two cents on the situation so, figured i'd go ahead and join in

once you get past all the drama and what not it all boils down to this:

i'm gonna miss it

it was a place were i could talk about comics with people who loved comics just as much as i do

it was a place i could laugh when someone made a comic joke

it was a place were i could roll my eyes when someone was fan-wanking

it was a place were i got to check out new titles i wasn't picking up or had never heard of (which lead me to adding even more titles to my pull list)

anyway, i'm gonna miss it.

'nuff said.

"event","the following four shots are all from the first roll of film i ever shot, developed, and printed.

it was right after the first day of photo class at mca back in 1997.

i was just taking photography so i could get the hours i needed to be a full time student.  i was originally an illustration major.

but, after i shot this roll and developed it myself and went through the whole process, i knew this is what i wanted to do and i've never looked back.

it's now 2009. i've been doing photography now for *geez* 12 years.

i'm gonna be scanning in more photos from the mca/late 90s era in the following days. it's amazing how much film i went through back in those days. i used to shoot any and everything. i tend to be more selective of what i shoot now.  i don't know if that's good or bad.

but these are the shots that started it all.

i'm not posting all the photos. i took over 500+ and i cut those down to 365 of the best ones. and i'm posting 21 out of that 365.

so, this is more of a sneak peak so <lj user=""karynbautista""> knows she's getting her money's worth ;)

There were two main stages (and many little ones) set up for the festival.  The two main ones were this one; the Voodoo Stage and the other one; the Playstation/Billboard.com Stage.<br /><br />They both had their own groups of security personal.  The Playstation/Billboard group were pretty laid back and would let people into the pit for pretty much any show (as long as you had on the proper wristband).  Now, the Voodoo Stage group, well, let's just say they were a bit more hardcore about everything.  (Which is why I couldn't get into the pit for <a href=""http://www.wyclef.com"">Wyclef</a> yesterday and <a href=""http://www.panicatthedisco.com"">Panic at The Disco</a> tomorrow.)<br /><br />Well, of course, Lil Wayne was performing on the Voodoo Stage.  But, as luck would have it, I managed to get in.  Yay. :)<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/sxyblkmn/3023568097/in/set-72157608897176155/""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/3023568097_4c1615b880_o.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><br /><em>Security taking someone down like a bad habit.

He loves what he does.<br /><br />The louder the crowd cheered the harder he would bring it and the harder he brought it the harder the crowd cheered and etc.<br /><br />I can't count the number of times he would just be smiling while he was performing.

I said cool and after he signed off went back to doing whatever it was I was doing before he GTalked me thinking, while it would be cool if I could go, I just didn't see it happening.<br /><br />A few days passed and he GTalked me again:<br />  <br /><strong>Daniel</strong>: i got you a pass! i'm driving down Friday. <a href=""http://www.joshhaileystudio.com"">Josh Hailey</a> and <a href=""http://clayhardwick.blogspot.com/"">Clay</a> are also driving down, so you could ride up with them Sunday...ride down with me Friday.<br /><br /><strong>me</strong>: then i think i'll be able to go then LoL. the hardest part for me was figuring out how to get down there and then back up here<br /><br /><strong>Daniel</strong>: that's taken care of. we also have a place to sleep on St. Charles!<br />so...you are about to have a fucking weekend of your life!<br />apperantly, mr. hailey has a hook up with a awesomely hot chick...so...get your camera ready, bring bateries, extra film, and great walking shoes...and EAR PLUGS!<br />WWWOOOOOOOOO to VOOOO DOOOOO! here we come!<br /><br />game on, bitches.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Story and Photos Await!""><br />Friday came and Daniel, Clay, Josh, and myself all piled our luggage and equipment into two cars and set off for New Orleans.<br /><br />A 3 hour drive and figuring out how to get to the park later, we were set to go.<br /><br /><a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/sxyblkmn/3023747487/in/set-72157608897176155/""><img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3038/3023747487_86329f6058_o.jpg"" /></a><table cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""1"" border=""1"" style=""width: 400px; height: 12px;""><tbody><tr><td><em>Josh Hailey and Daniel G. getting fired up and ready to go. oct. 24, 2008</em></td></tr></tbody></table><br />I decided to always make sure that the first photo of the day would be when we first got out the car before we started walking to the main area to get started.

They had a tip hat laying a few feet in front of them.  So you know what that means.  That's right!  We didn't tip but we did the next best thing...<br /><br /><a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/sxyblkmn/3024577108/in/set-72157608897176155/""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3223/3024577108_3b036fca1e_o.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><br /><table cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""1"" border=""1"" style=""width: 457px; height: 8px;""><tbody><tr><td><em>Clay and Daniel recording footage of street performers for The Code.

Because this would be the closest I would get to Wyclef for the rest of the festival.  When his show started, only one photographer from a group was allowed into the pit, so Josh managed to get in but I had to wait on the sidelines for this one.  Now, that wasn't always the case for all the shows.  In fact, it really depended on the security guys.  But, needless to say, it was the case for Wyclef.<br /><br />(and if you look between Wyclef and the FuseTV guy holding the mic, you can see Daniel.  that wacky Daniel, always mugging for the camera)<br /><br /><a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/sxyblkmn/3023747655/in/set-72157608897176155/""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3227/3023747655_9cb3cd482d_o.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><br /><table cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""1"" border=""1"" style=""width: 338px; height: 23px;""><tbody><tr><td><em>Crowd waiting for Wyclef Jean to start his show.

i'll be honest, i'm an optimistic man but even i thought i would be an old man before i saw a day like this

i was jumping up and down and got teary eyed.  my mom was crying so much she couldn't even talk on the phone to her sister. jen called us all the way from england and you could hear cheering in the background from the watch party she was at as she called to make sure they had called it for him.

the work begins tomorrow, but for tonight, sit back and smile at what we all accomplished.

and remember as long as there's an america, his portrait will be hanging next to all those other president's portraits.  

isn't that fucking cool? :)

these last six are the ones i shot using my <a href=""http://www.lomography.com/holga/"" target=""_new"">holga</a>

i thought about it, and this was actually the first time i've ever used my holga during an actual photoshoot.

same model, same light, completely different feel.

isn't that how it should be?

This is the dramatic moment a TV reporter was shot by a sniper as she reported live from war-torn Georgia.

Tamara Urushadze took a bullet to her left arm in the flashpoint town of Gori as Russian forces continued their illegal occupation.

Bravely, or foolishly, the 32-year-old brunette continued her report after a few moments as other journalists and aid workers dashed for cover."

this was also her first solo show, but <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M077eVU8Zk8"" target=""_new"">not the first time she's been on stage</a> (yes, that's legendary singer sam moore. and yes that's her on the today show singing with him.)

i can't believe this girl is only 16 years old. when i was sixteen, i was still trying to figure out how the hell to survive high school and here she is singing live on going on tour in japan this august.  wild.

oh, and this was the first time her and her band performed together too. they'd only meet 4 days before the show.  and if i hadn't been told that i never would have known. they played that show like they'd been playing together for years

and now, photos (which is really what ya come for) ;)

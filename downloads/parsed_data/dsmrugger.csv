I have amazing friends, if I could, I'd give you all the world.

Haley, You're the only person I want to call when I'm that much of a mess and I'm glad that you never fail to pick up. ALLLL love darling.

I'm gonna miss IC a whole lot, the atmosphere, the studes, and the people most of all. I'm sure we will be taking numerous trips to chicago, CB, IC, and random concerts wherever we'd like to go. Psh, it's only two months, it'll be fine right? The relationships I've made aren't the kind that fade that quickly. Fall will come soon enough and once again, we cann all be drunken messes together and not just on the phone, but we will have Haley and Chris.. making our lives 24 kinds of a mess rather than 12. 

Stacey, Matty. Imma miss you way more than I could express, way way more. We better make this last week memorable. But of course, I will be standing right next to you at your weddings (which was drunkenly discussed last night.. I can only imagine what those around us thought of us... I'm sure there was some major judging going on, as always hah) and any significant event in your life you need me at. I'll always always be here. I love you both and wish you the best of luck in Illinois, of course. Stace, I'll be coming up frequently to make sure you get trashed beyond belief, cuz ya know, it's gotta happen every once in a while, and someone's gotta blame me for their terrible hangover.

You must come visit! Juliet and I didn't get an apartment with a huge living room for nothing... which I'm way excited about as well. Juliet, darling, it's going to be fabulous, I can't wait.

enough sappiness, I'm over it. I love you all and you know it."

"event","So I just got done playing bingo with my parents in their 55+ community at the clubhouse, that most of them drive to... dead serious. The most one of them live is like 2 or 3 bolcks away. but alas, this is what old age does to you. After consecutively losing, hah and watching how upset my mother got about how she has yet to win ""ONCE!"" in 40 nights of bingo I came back to their house and decided to take advantage of my last night here. It's 11 pm and still 72 degrees and breezy. If every single day was like this, it would be all I need in life.

I decided I hadn't wrote an lj in a while so I brought my computer outside, am sitting in a wicker chair my mom probably got for free off the side of the road, under a palm tree, surrounded by flowers and am stealing wireless off a network named ""NETGEAR"" from probably an 80 year old couple. love it.

So I went and saw 300 the other day. I never thought Id see the day I would cry multiple times in a movie based off a comic book... i know right? Well regardless, it was based off a true story and was absolutely amazing. I would definitely suggest seeing it. So it made me think of love. These Spartans were taught not to love and were taught to fight, to die in battle with honor and glory, and that's all there was to life. Well when the king leaves for battle he could not tell ""his queen"", as he refers to her, that he loved her as much as he wanted to. He ends up dying in battle and his last words were ""my queen, my wife, my love"". It kind of made me think how recognition should be expressed as much as possible, whenever you truly, honestly feel it. I mean, I feel like words can speak just as loudly as actions in some cases. When feelings aren't expressed clearly it's like they could be eventually lost forever and could have possibly held the key to some life changing event, most of all happiness... and if not, whatevs, life will continue on down its unpredictable path freely, without any restraints.

I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with this, but Jessie is yelling at me to come rub lotion on her back, due to the horrible sun burns we got laying out on the beach for hours with 8 SPF tanning lotion. course.

Love you all. miss you all. see you soon, I'm sure."

"event","good thing 1: I woke up at 830 am... to a lot of snow. I love it. Went out to my car and found that I made it right before the parking lady got to my meter therefore preventing my father from yelling at me for yet another ticket.

good thing 2: Moved my car to Iowa Ave. and then proceeded to Jhouse... cuz really, where else would I go that early? The lady working the register (whom I'm assuming was new) gave me the employee discount on my depth charge because she thought I worked there. After informing her that really I'm just here more often than the actual employees and am not an actual one myself (unfortunately) she gave me the discount anyway. Saved a dollar :).

good thing 3: Played with mice in bio lab where they didn't end up dying. The little babe was soo fat. Reminded me of my own babes. :)

good thing 4: Was let out of my history class 20 minutes early and scored 10/10 on my quiz from last week. Which leads me to think of how my teacher for this class reminds me of the new character Phylis from the L Word.. although less creepy and awkward... and she seems like a Scorpio.. which is hot.

good thing 5: Skipped my bio lecture, bought some new headphones, and returned to JHouse with my asian (hah, in none other than the possessive form.)

And it's only 2:55.

:)

The weekend was amazing. Ladies, I love you all.

Going to DSM this weekend to see the new puppies and The Vagina Monologues at Drake with Stace, since I wasn't able to actually be in the show again this year (unfortunately). I'm excite.

I'm so used to not having anything to worry about, being completely care.free.

I've been thinking about being a twin and how Jessie and I are, in all actuality, ridiculously alike... other than one being left brained and one being right. Even down to the people we date and the people we tend to be attracted to. I always used to make fun of her for it, but the more I've thought about it, I'm really not all different. But I see it as a good thing... for sure.

My moods have been really up and down lately, and no, it's not due to that.

-My birthday's coming up... woot.

-I can't buy the ink I need for my printer anywhere so I have to special order it, meaning I have to pay for it. Ink's way too expensive.
-Low self esteem in others, especially friends that are fucking amazing and beautiful.

-Feeling helpless.
-Being two hours away from someone that completely relies on me.

I kind of wish I was 5 again and life was so simple and not restricted.

Have you ever thought about how when people feel both sexes should be treated equally, they always say we should treat women like we treat the men? Why couldn't we treat the men like we do the women? Wouldn't that make much more sense?

This summer is lookin up. Pride was this week and instead of a 1 day event they made it into a 2 day, which is, of course, more excuse to drink a lot and feel really good about it. I wasnt feelin so hot Saturday and Sunday morning but it's always totally worth it. But ya know. I got some pictures... not nearly as much as I was hoping but ya know, it wasnt on the top of my list of priorities. I really wish these pictures could sum up the weekend, but unfortunately it's not gonna do it. Here they are anyway, theyre worth posting regardless. For some reason the LJ cut isn't working and it just deleted everything last time. So I'm not gonna risk it and you're gonna deal. sounds good.

Oh Leah. I honestly don't know what I'd do without her. This one was taken around 1:30 AM and we had been drinking since about 5 PM. I actually look relatively sober when in all reality I was way worse than Leah. We ended up just bar hopping all night and we went and saw Betsy West at HoB. It was a good time other than some of the crazy lesbians we were with wanted to get in fights and all I wanted to do was dance. At the end of the night I felt so damn good, it was totally that perfect level you get to when you drink. Kind of fabulous. I've come to the conclusion that the Frathouse plays way better music than the Garden. Having a fake is a great thing. Mad props to Leah for letting me crash at her place so damn often and for taking care of me. 

I got my housing letter today. I'm in a single in the Quad. Definitely wasn't my first choice but I can learn to deal."

"event","High school is officially over. It's rather bittersweet but I was too glad to be rid of Calculus and finish the final to really stop and let it all sink in. At line of march (as well as graduation), I got the honor of sitting next to this big girl who takes up not only her seat, but half of mine as well. She also for whatever reason feels the need to be obnoxious and ghetto as all hell. Ah well, I guess that's Roosevelt for ya. Luckily though, on my other side is Jessie, of course.

I need to find a job. Something I can at least benefit from. Hah I have a friend who works at Victoria's Secret and she informed me that they're hiring for their semi-annual sale. As tempting as that sounds, it'd be worthless because I don't have a lover I could buy sexy underwear for. I'll prolly apply at the Gap...it's practically my wardrobe. We'll see. I basically just need something to take up time, there's too much of it floating around, and that's never a good thing.

The cleaning process for my Grad party has begun and of course my mom wants everything to look perfect so the relatives don't think we're trash. I think it looks fine, hah. whatever.

I was thinking the other day about how I have so many friends I have lost touch with over the years and it's really slightly depressing. All that time building a friendship and then it slowly fading into nothingness. I mean yeah, people change, but there really isn't any reason not to keep in touch. Unless of course distance, that always fucks thing up pretty well. Soo I took the initiative and sent them all Graduation party invites. I figure this is as good a time if any. 

I think I may grow my hair back out... not to drastic lengths, such as my shoulders... more of just how it was like in my senior picture (my icon). I duhno If I'll make it though considering longer hair in the summer frustrates me and I ended up getting pissed at it and cutting it off. Well see if I can do it.

I was told the other day that I'm receiving a tattoo for my belated birthday gift/half of graduation gift. I'm really excited about this because 1. I can't back out of receiving a gift and 2. I don't have the money. I've decided on the design and I'm psyched about it.

meh, enough for now. Summer's here and I'm way psyched for it. Now all I need is some summer lovin'. Psh, I'll keep hopin."

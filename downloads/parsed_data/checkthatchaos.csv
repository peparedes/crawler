"event","boon here, this livejournal has a horrible layout. i hope you guys realize this.
but anyway, french fries are pretty cool. 
& also, i used to have a crush on sk8master dave, so he's pretty awesome too.
i went to the country fair, so many interesting people. 
um, yeah, i've known french fry for a while. she came to my house this one time & this kid (we'll call him 'dirty j') looked up her skirt. she loved every minute of it. 
so dave likes sex and the city & family guy, but if you watch it with him you better watch your back cause those are our shows. also, if you listen to 'moondance' with him, i'll beat you up. the memories, you can't take the memories.
alright, i love you guys.

oh.
the drugs don't work, they just make you worse.

p.s. 
dave & bre have yet to explain this process to you non livejournal people.
if you want to update, go to http://www.livejournal.com, & hit log in. then type in ""checkthechaos"" as the username & the password is 'crzy4u'. i hope you feel better knowing that.

"event","David here and I Breonna decided to start a community journal, for anyone to use at any time, hints the name Check that chaos.......We want everyones thoughts and feelings posted here on this very live journal. David and I have a list of things for us to do this summer and this was one of the VERY many fun activities we had planned, so enjoy and have fun.

                     MY DAY WITH DAVID.....by Breonna Fagen
Today David and I decided it was going to be list day, and we would get some boxes marked off our list, so we started with this soon to be chaotic live journal. Then we went onto throwing rocks in a river or lake. so david and i headed to a river where we ran around bare foot slipping and sliding on gross slimy rocks. I ALMOST DROWNED!!! (ok I'm over exaggerating but still it was scary.) then we climbed some rocks bare foot. and threw some rocks into the river. After that little adventure David and i went to drake park to climb a tree. Now imagine this HUGE tree with bark covering the whole thing and ZERO branches, might i add NOTHING to hold on to. David being able to climb anything and everything got right up there, but me it took forever but I DID IT......as soon as i got up there i looked down and i had no idea how i was going to get back on the ground. I started FREAKING OUT!!! David being the good guy he is tried to think of every possible scenario for me to get down decided that I just had to jump. It was so scary, if i had a cell phone in hand i would have called 911 to bring me a ladder. But i jumped, It hurt my ankles soo bad but i did it, i climbed the tree by myself and got out by myself also... (well maybe a little help from david) but it was fun.
sorry the first post is so long.........
anyone who wants to go on a spelunking adventure (caving) let david or i know."

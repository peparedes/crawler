"event","so...second day of school could have gone just a little bit more exciting maybe. time went by so slowly no matter what i was doing. i know i should feel blessed to have half days...but i still have a problem with something. WHY DO TEACHERS HAVE TO FREAKING TEACH ALL THE TIME? cant they just sit there and say...""here's a fantastic movie class. feel free to snack on these delicious appetizers and take a nap if you start to get drowsy. dont worry about homework. homework is for nerds."" that is what teachers SHOULD do. but no. they stand there....and talk...for hours. and some days, they even expect you to sit there and listen to them continue to talk during conference hour like thats what's on everyone's mind. they dont even care that I lose all feeling in both butt cheeks by conference time. The only thing i could think about while trying to look like i was listening, was how tired their feet must be standing. i just wanted to throw a big rock at their knee caps and MAKE them sit. AND STOP TALKING. AND STOP GIVING ME INFORMATION AND SILLY RULES AND TRYING TO BE FUNNY. it must be so exhausting being a teacher. you'd think they'd just ask for a break. but they never break. not even if you throw rocks st them. ooh! just a side note:being bluntly honest with people usually results in not good feelings towards that person. so it's a good idea to stay clear of it. haha mr, minafri started singing ""jesus loves me yes he does...."" really quietly today in class. that man is a mad man!"

"event","heyus! i'm sooooo going snowboarding! i dont know how it will go but i'm sure i will be coming home thursday with several bruises on my buttocks. i am also at a turning point in my life. maybe its the christmasness in the air or maybe it was something in the egg nog my mom made. i dont know who cares to know but pretty much, i'm sick of sucking at life. Therefore, starting now i am saving for a car(for real), excercising, eating right, sleeping right, applying for asu, saving for a place to stay after high school, and in march i will get a new job that i actually like. wish me luck as i feed myself to the sharks."

- slept in; wishing it was a saturday.

- my ride came and i was greeted w/ chocolate cake and hot chocolate made by the lovely        richard.

- spilled hot chocolate on myself and was late for zero hour.

- my phone went off in 4th hour and the teacher told me that I was the only hoolagin in class.

- was suppose to make up crap group work for sign language during conference but my group didnt show up.

- got sick and pissed off during 5th hour and ended up yelling at these kids who ratted me out for ditching.

- went to lunch, and saw richard's precious puppys 

- i told the puppy to pee on the seminary carpet and ofcoarse it did and so i got to clean it up.

- went home and watched a movie by myself and took a nap.

- made plans, had to brake plans, made better plans, had to brake those plans, then had those plans broken; all for what? to satisfy the fast food needs of two boys who wanted to get back to their virtual reality."

"event","ty your shoes and jacob jingle hymer shmit were my heroes today at buffalo wild wings. they did the unspeakable 12 suicide wings in 2 minutes. that's just crazy. and they did it w/ only a few tears. so today i was picking through a few different hobbies i could start up and i couldn't decide so i picked 5. they are as follows:                                    

1) becoming tite friends w/ one of the security guards at hamilton during my aiding class. i will soon know when their birthday is, what they want for their birthday, and what their most traumatic birthday experience has been.
2) learning how to gleak across the room.
3) altering my personality to where it becomes acceptable for me to say, ""Oh H' no cracka. you get off this shiz for i call yem occifers on yall to bust a caps on yalls motha for this harrismint!""
4) learning the art of total peace and tranquility.
5) finding what is equivilent to halo 2 in a girl's perspective."

I would even say he went nuts! I dont think he appriciated it very much. I dont think i'll try that again. But anyway, today was a good day overall becuase it went by way fast. I love my first hour! the lady gives me a treat everyday and acts like i save her life everytime i do something for her. it's the best class ever! i got to give a tour of the school to this new girl today and she seemed really nice. oh what it is to be the new kid. *sigh.....*"

HATE IT! becuase it's dumb. i really couldnt care less if amanda and linsey both like jeremy at work becuase we all know that jeremy is gay.  they are just waisting their time backstabbing eachother for this guy because even if jeremy does pick one of the girls, they will go out for a while, share some good times, then he will wake up one morning and decide that he doesnt like that girl anymore, then he wont tell her, but instead decide to stop talking to her, then not tell her why he isnt talking to her, then he will make her find out from one of his friends since he is too pansy to have an adult conversation about it to her face. and THAT'S how it all ends. so good luck amanda and linsey!"

Clanton, the new seminary teacher.  i am still trying to understand his reasoning for the way he conducts his teaching. It's like he doesnt even care if his students like him. (Or maybe he does but he isnt succeeding if that was his intention.) it made me realize that i need to stop asking why people are the way they are and just except the fact that some people will just confuse the crack out of me no matter how hard i try to understand their intentions and reasons."

"event","For those of you who don't know me, my name is Gaedyn {pronounced Gay-den}. My full given name is a bit longer and harder to pronounce. I am the eldest son of King Oberon of The Faery Realm. I am also a half breed. I am part Faery and part Human. I was born in what is now called Greece. As a child I was told that I would live forever because of my father's genetics. Throughout my life I wondered if it was true. I am told that I look like my father in many ways. We both have hair as black as Brother Night and eyes as pale as the Sister Moon. 

I have lived among Humans for as far back as I remember. They have not always been kind or accepting of me, but the few who are have stayed in my heart. I have been known by many names the humans have called me such as Demon, Evil, Spirit, High One and a few names more proper like Jason, Jaden, or Black Hair. 

I have been known to shape-shift my form to fit in with others. In my normal state I am 6'3"", have dark skin, large pale blue eyes, slightly pointed ears and only 8 fingers and toes. When I'm around humans my ears round off, and I manage to grow an extra 2 fingers and toes. I've noticed that humans have gotten taller over the centuries, so I see no need now to change my height. 

I have died once, lost my body in the icy mountains of the Viking Homeland while fighting a battle I was dragged into. My body is not there any more. My spirit - the part of me that never dies - shares a home inside the mind of a young woman. When she was born into this world as a human with a elfish soul and the understanding of the great Gods themselves - I became her guardian and teacher, which has led to a few problems for her. sharing the same pair of eyes we tend to find different people attractive. I fear that I have only helped in confusing her as she ages. 

This journal was created so that I might tell my story. The story of an immortal whose body had died, but whose soul would never know rest."

"event","I'm on the plane flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Mab wanted to travel like the humans do, so we took a plane to Scotland. We should be there in about two hours.  We left early this morning. Its a small plane. There are only about twenty of us on it, including the pilots and flight crew. I've never flown in an aeroplane before. Its quite an impressive invention. I haven't figured out yet how something so heavy with so many people in it stays in the air, but I plan to get a closer look at its inner workings when we land. I'm interested in how they made the wings of steel fly. It has the shape of a bird, but not the weight of one - which makes me worry. 

I put a girl-child to sleep earlier. She was crying and making her mother embarrassed. So I sang to her telepathically and she fell asleep. It was amazing to witness. I've never touched the thoughts of a mortal child. Its amazing to find out just how much they actually know at that age. Mortal children are born with the knowlefge of the entire world and by bringing them out and exposing them to society they lose that knowledge. It is actually very tragic that this happens and also explains the mystery of why children around the age of 2 years begin to constantly ask the question ""Why?"". It is because they have forgotten. It also explains some of the people I've met in New York. Had they been able to keep the knowledge they were born with maybe we would have gotten along. I'm guessing this is only in human children, but I'm not sure. I'll have to do some research when I get to Scotland. I'm sure there are children in my father's kingdom, so I will try this while I am there. There is also the possibility that faery children do not like someone touching their thoughts that they do not know. Human children are very open to strangers. Amazing, just amazing. 

When the girl-child woke up an hour later she looked right at me and smiled. She had known that it was me who had sung to her. she looks at me every onc ein awhile. I think she is studying me, but I'm not sure why. She has a very old look in her eyes. I have a feeling that she possesses a very old soul. I wonder who she was before she was this girl-child. 

I remember when a friend of mine was given a new body. Taryn. she wasn't happy about that one at all. She had been a skilled Atlantian Healer for years and then decided she wanted to be a human for a day. She ended up being killed. When she pleaded to The Elders to be given a new body they gave her a time limit to find one. When her time was almost up, she asked to share my body until she found one she could use. We shared a body for one humans' lifetime, which at the time was roughly 30 or so years. It was an interesting experience. Yes, the girl-child has very old eyes, much like Taryn's when we first met. 


I got to go through my first Air Port. That was an interesting experience as well. It is also loud and filled with many people. I was asked by three different uniformed men where the rest of my luggage was. I'd only brought my sack with a bit of clothing in it. I didn't realize I was supposed to pack a large amount of things. I'd noticed that other passengers were carrying vast amounts of luggage. The average was about two suitcases. I didn't really see the need for it. Mab told me to bring whatever I needed -- so I did. 

Mab taught me the most interesting trick. Before we had gotten on the aeroplane we didn't realize we would need these little black books called ""passports"". She made one appear in her hand. She put her book in my hand and made me close my eyes. I saw the contents of the book and envisioned one of my own except it had my information in it. When I opened my hands I had two passports. I made mine of fawn leather, made myself twenty-four years of age, single and I made a picture of myself with a Van Dyke. I think I shall regrow mine while I'm in Scotland."

"event","My trip so far has been okay. It was a bit odd seeing my step-mother, Mab, with normal, mortal, clothing and aspect this morning when she arrived at the doorstep of my studio. I had to wonder if she had travelled there like the humans do, or if she had just appeared there, like my father does when he wishes to be someplace. I'm told its called ""apparating"". Being the Queen of the Faeries, Mab has the power to appear anyway she wished. She managed to put my roommate/dog, Ishtar, to sleep to keep him from barking at her. She claimed his voice was too piercing to her delicate ears. I'm sure he was quite irritated about that one. He's a tad tempermental. He prefers to be awake when there are visitors in the house. He is very territorial about the studio. I have no clue why. I'm the one that pays the rent on the studio and owns everything in it, not including a pair of my sweat pants that he has torn to rags and the dryer that he sleeps in because I have yet to figure out what its purpose is or how it works correctly. 

Ish {the dog} doesn't like Mab very much, but then again he doesn't like many people. He tolerates the hand that feeds him and he takes aliking to kind old women and young pretty women. My step-mother hadn't the appearence of either. He said she smelled funny, which I could understand. She wore the appearence of a human, but smelled of an exotic flower. I wondered how I smelled to a trained nose. I'm sure that being in a human form, but being part faery, I would have smelled odd as well. It wasn't something that terribly disturbed me. I would leave it for another time to figure out. Perhaps after I returned from my visit to my father. 

It was rather mazing to watch Mab look at him and have him fall to the floor in a heap of mangled fur and fall asleep. She said he would awaken by the time we had exited the building. I'm hoping that he is okay. He's such a tiresome roommate, but I guess I would be too if I were once a warlock and turned into a dog. If I had to spend eternity as a dog, I'd be a bit sour with everyone I'd encountered as well. 

Mrs. Bama, the kindly old lady who lives a floor below me, said she would take care of feeding and walking Ishtar while I was away. He promised to keep her company in my absence. I think they will be fine together. They tend to get along quite nicely. She enjoys his company, and he enjoys the meat scraps she gives him while making dinner. He's very well behaved around her. I'm sure he will miss his daily wrestling matches with me, but we will take care of that when I return. 

Stacy, a human girl I know, has promised to check in on Mrs. Bama for me while I'm gone. She just knows that I'm visiting my parents for the holidays. She is still under the impression that I'm a human like herself. Foolish human girl. She is amusing though and she has taught me much about the human world that I missed in the past few centuries I was gone."

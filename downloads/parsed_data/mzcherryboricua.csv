"event","man.... its not my type of day, im so depressed... im thinking of all the boys i had ever fallen in love with and it makes me real sad... Goober, man why did we have to ever meet? if i could take back that day trust me we would end up friends today... i seriously dont know why he's on my mind maybe because he was the one i went out with for like five years and he is the only one that i trusted... damn why he gotta do this to me ( crying )... and like he has two kids and his family doesnt know and i feel as if i should tell them but i dont want to ruin his life when i am always going to love him....damn.... i didnt want me to beleive that i will always love him but its true, we were the ones no other couple could be like....then Mario, the one who cheated on me like 3 times but i could never get rid of him and i still love him... damn i need a real love... someone who doesnt hurt me... someone who is happy that i am theirs not anyone elses. 

if anyone out there has suggestions please let me know....

"event","well today has been so hectic so many people are like confusing me.... for example i am in love with my boyfriend DiMario but i like another boy and i cant say who at this moment. the reason why i am saying that i am confused is because dimario says that he loves me but then he acts very strange when i tell him how i feel.... its like i want to be with him but i am the only one in the relationship that tries. now that i dont live on the east side no more he acts a lot more strange, like he knows that since i dont live near him he can do whatever he wants to now..... what the fuck??????? why cant he just understand that he fuckin got me twisted and sprung...... damn i love him..... and now my ex boyfriend abdul (goober) gobah wants me back...... he is the one that twisted my life around... we were so young and now that we are older he wants me back.... i dont want him back because we have been through so much and i cannot be hurt anymore....why cant he just see that.... and my enemy is like now talking to me JICA, why cant she see that once you take a man away and then get mad at me because i tell you the truth about how he is going to treat you honey please dont talk to me no more....... oh yea and this dumb ass boy castro wont stop pissing my best friend jackie off.... he loves her but then again plays with her heart and now she is like all depressed.... why cant anyone just realize that we girls are going to come back and kick azz......"

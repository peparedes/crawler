"event","<p>Hello there!<br /><br />So ever since&nbsp;I saw that one episode of <em>D-Gray Man</em> at Colassal Con, I've become interested in it. So I started reading the manga and it's pretty good. The anime isn't out in America yet ( XP ) but it's coming out in 2009. I want to go buy the manga because it was released on May 6th, 2008! <br /><br />Anyway, I've been in the mood for a new manga/anime ever since I finished reading <em>Inuyasha</em>. So... got any suggestions? I prefer romance, action/adventure, and fantasy but I'll try anything! ^_^&nbsp;<br /><br />Got anything good?<br /><br /></p>"

"event","Not exactly though, i've taken yesterday and today off simply cuz I had my wisdom teeth out on monday. I'm in a little physical pain, but nothing compared to the phycological pain I had to go through during surgery. I'll explain:

So I call the wisdom teeth people and they explain all these surgery options. One is a local anesthetic, so you're still awake and remember everything. The other is a partial out-ness, where the doc can still communicate during surgery, but you remember nothing after. Lastly is complete out-ness where the doctor can poke you in the eye and it's all good.

I let them know that the mid option sounded good cuz: 1) it was the middle price, 2) i would remember none of the trauma, and 3) I haven't historically responded well to local anesthetics (they dont work well on my and my super-human constitution or something. So I let them know that.

Monday rolls around and I walk into the office, only to be told they hadn't prepped for a partical out-ness and that I could either do it know with a local or re-shedule. I say, ""whatever, i'm here, let's get it done.""

Well, since I dont respond well to local freezing, the doctor gives me twice as much, but still after waiting for 20 mins he asks, ""All nice and frozen?"" To which I respond, ""Umm...no."" He then promptly shoots me up of more novacain and gets started.

The first one is pretty bad, I can hear it being cracked open and gouged. It actually sounded exactly like someone cracking open an oyster. The second one is actually un-noticeable. The third is insanly painful and he goes, ""Hmm...should be all frozen, don't worry i'll give you another shot...this time you wont even notice the needle."" He's wrong...fantastically wrong. 

I cringe in pain and he makes this inquisitive ""Hmm?"" sound, as if i'm some sort of anomoly.

He then decides there is little else he can do to ease my pain and begins work on the third tooth. It hurts like hell, and i'm beginning to feel as though I have gained a profound insight into what sort of pain mothers in labour go through.

That one takes forever, and half way he stops and asks ""Do you feel pain or pressure?"" And i'm thinking, ""what the fuck is the difference,"" but only manage a muffled, ""Iono...""

The last tooth is also a bastard, but it finally cooperates. In totally I sustain 1 hour of cracking and squirting and ""hmm""-ing from my doctor. Not to mention 12 injections of novacain and some more of anti-swelling medication.

No i'm on Tylenol 3. Lots and lots of Tylenol 3.

I'll be off work one more day, but it'll be business as usual from then till the 10th when my job ends! Yay!

Talk to you all soon!"

"event","So a lot has happened...well not really. I've been insanely busy, working 7 days a week for the past month and a half. I need all the money cuz I'm planning on moving out when I get back from Africa. Speaking of Africa, my malaria medicine gave me some crazy side effects and I had to stop using it and switch  brands. As for my job, it's been great. Stopping industrial espionage and meeting Koreans...really! And I went to the jazz fest for a couple of nights....good fun, good music. I apologize for not making this more entertaining or coherent, but with no day off in more than a month happy Alvin has fled and has been replaced with angry worker Alvin....happy Alvin did manage to resurface on election day though and vote NDP! (Go minority government!) But he's back now....oh, and sorry PEI...looks like you guys are staying red. Tsk Tsk...."

"event","I was all sick this weekend cuz of those damn malaria pills, but that's pver now! It was a small week long test to see if they didn't kill me, and they didn't, so it's good to be used in Mozambique. But they still make me sick! And I mean very sick! But apparently that isn't a good enough reason to declare the drugs incompatible with me...so i'm stuck with them...and the doc said that after a few weeks the side-effects wont be AS bad...

Well, I have to start taking these malaria tablets to see if this brand is ok, or if I have to switch because of some sorta crazy side effects...one of the main side effects is apparently crazy dreams and nightmares, and that's the mild stuff. It can get as bad as hair loss and suicidal thoughts.

For god sakes people! If you want to have 15% taxes move to Delaware and live a short, unproductive life where your partner becomes obese, your daughter gets pregnant at 13 and drops out of school, your son finds out he's gay and gets beaten up for it, and your next door neighbour pointlessly dies in another illegal and morally unjustifiable invasion.

But if you want a <I>life</I> you can stay in Canada, vote for the NDP, accept a 40% progressive taxation scheme where you are not slowly dying of chronic heart disease, your daughter is educated and responsible, your son need not fear discrimination, and you help prevent wars, not start them. Add on top of that: Clean water and air, affordable or free post-secondary, a vibrant green economy, and no working poor and needlessly homeless.

Sometimes I think that people over the age of forty should be forbidden from voting...you had your chance, you fucked it up, move over and give us a shot."

I was just at the bank getting a money order for my Canada World Youth fee and this woman says to me from behind, ""Where are you going?"" I thought she was talking to someone else, so I dont say anything. Then she taps me on the side and asks again. It turns out she did the program when she was 18 and went to India and Vancouver, she was from Montreal at the time, and now lives here. It was so weird, but awesome at the same time. We talked about her experience and stuff and it was good. So now i'm more stoked than ever to get on with it all!

Since I work at a government agency, they have all these french materials so people can learn. I was gonna join their classes, but they are still on numbers and simple adjectives (like jolie) after 18 months! So the teacher (yep they have a teacher for the office) said that it would be much too slow for me, so she gave me a bunch of tapes and CDs...it's good. I've always wanted to be able to speak french conversationally...but I hate classroom style french instruction with a vengeance! So my goal is to learn it myself...I figure with 4 solid months of learning I can at least get partially there.

"event","So I am this big NDP supporter, I don't think that's a huge secret or anything, anyways...the NDP candidate in our riding is Libby Davies, she's won twice before and she rocks. So they call me up and ask if I want a sign, and I go, ""Of course, the biggest one you have!"" and they're all like, ""Wicked! It's yours."" So the sign goes up a couple of days later and it looks great and i'm smiling 'cause you can see it 4 blocks away in either direction. Now I get home today and notice something sticking out of my mail slot, so I go downstairs and grab it. Lo and behold it's a campaign flyer from Shirley Chan, the Liberal candidate running against Libby. This wouldn't have been that big a deal, even though there's a big Libby/NDP sign out front that you cant miss and it makes no sense to waste a flyer on a house that's basically screaming ""We're voting for Libby, eat it!"". What made it a big deal was that the person who dropped it off wrote at the top of it, ""We think she's a better candidate, here's why."" and then all her campaign stuff below on the flyer. That pissed me off. I dont know why, but it did. So here we have some dipshit who's walking down the street peppering homes with Shirley Chan flyers and they come to a house with a gigantic NDP sign (a sign so large infact that it needs to be held up by 2x4's hammered into the ground, you know that kind) and they think...""hmm...while it appears obvious this person is never in hell going to vote Liberal, i'll drop off a sign nonetheless, and while i'm at it i'll write a small message designed to sway the vote of the reader even though it's so painfully obvious I dont stand a chance in actually having the message work."" Anyways...So i'm reading this...half mad...half laughing at the utter idiocy of this flyer-hander-outer and I get an idea. I take out my sharpie and write below their writing (that says, ""We think she's a better candidate here's why,"") ""I DONT...HERE'S WHY."" I wrote 10 points, every one of them true, and with the little space I have on the back I write that there is not a chance i'll vote for a Martin Liberal and that it was a waste of time to flyer a house with a friggin' huge Libby poster. Since this post is excessively long, I wont bother you with the details of what I wrote here, but if you are curious at my 10 reasons (because they are serious and they are all true) post a reply and i'll post what I wrote. *exhale* There you have it...Kiri, you're not the only one. (Oh, and Robyn...maybe you could use the info since you're doing that mock election thingy...let me know) BTW: Here is a pic of the front and back of the flyer after I was done with it...

CIA central command was notified at 8:12am PST and our agents moved in to apprehend the suspect. The individual was found at 8:42am PST eating a shredded wheat cereal product submerged in milk. He put up no struggle but was reportedly muttering obscenities under his breath, most of which directed to an individual he referred to as ""That damn PEI girl and her damn livejournal.""

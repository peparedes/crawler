"event","Happy Valentine's Day, kids.<br /><br /><br />I have a valentine, this year. I'm in love. And I love it. Yet, still...<br /><br /><br />Through all this wonderment, and lavish shows of affection, appreciation, and on-going emotion, let us not forget certain truths that we may find ourselves unwittingly contributing to:<br /><br /><h1>Blood Diamonds</h1> <img width=""250"" vspace=""10"" hspace=""10"" height=""150"" align=""right"" src=""http://www.rotten.com/library/crime/blood-diamonds/girlsbestfriend.jpg"" alt="""" /> The term ""Blood Diamonds"" is a politically-charged tool meant to cause revulsion and thoughtfulness in anyone who happens to own them. This would be a tactic similar to calling Fur Coats ""Slaughter Jackets"". However, the term sounds <i>really cool</i> so let's go with it.  <p> Diamonds are very valuable. Artificially so, as anyone who has studied the history of the Debeers company can tell you, but still incredibly valuable. If you have them, you can make a lot of money selling them, and that's money that can go to plenty of good uses, like luxury homes, kick-ass meals by the finest chefs, and paying for your army to recklessly slaughter thousands of your people. </p><p> It's the last use that's a bit of a sticky wicket, as you might imagine. And in countries like Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, where fighting is basically all they do and they've gotten <i>really good at it</i> to the detriment of stability, peace and good will, the ability to bring in money from any source (since their economies are in shambles) is seized upon at any cost. And so there you have it; armies forcing people at below slave wages to extract diamonds from the earth, and these diamonds then being sold through a bunch of different shady middlemen to end up on Madame Gordogato's beautiful bracelet. Like pretty much everything else that depends on some pain down the line (like, say, Chicken Nuggets or Petroleum), the end customer is unaware what happened three months and five countries ago. </p><p> Obviously, it is in the best interest of DeBeers and other diamond merchants to keep this unpleasant aspect of things away from the dinner table, and so begins an endless soap opera of accusations, defenses, stonewalling, exposes and all the other fun that happens in a situation like this. Meanwhile, those diamonds <i>are</i> getting sold, people <i>are</i> getting fucked over, and people continue to think putting a nice big rock on a ring means you'll love them forever. </p><p> Recently, groups that suck at marketing changed the term to ""Conflict Diamonds"", which is probably more accurate but about a fifth as evocative. Some people don't know to leave well enough alone. </p>Compliments of the Rotten Library."

I have these great MP3s for some death metal band, but alas...I haven't the slightest fucking idea whom it is. If you're in the market for some karma points, I could use a superior knowledge of such things. I tend to be on in the AM hours, near the midnight variety. If it's a hassle, I understand.

Petersen<br />                      Council of the 12 Apostles<br /><br /><br />        Be assured that you can be cured of your difficulty.  Many have been,<br />both male and female, and you can be also if you determine that it must be so.<br /><br />        This determination is the first step.  That is where we begin.  You<br />must decide that you will end this practice, and when you make that decision,<br />the problem will be greatly reduced at once.<br /><br />        But it must be more than a hope or a whish, more than knowing that it<br />is good for you.  It must be actually a DECISION.  If you truly make up your<br />mind that you will be cured, then you will have the strength to resist any<br />tendencies which you may have and any temptations which may come to you.<br /><br />        After you have made this decision, then observe the following specific<br />guidelines:<br /><br /><br /><br />                       A Guide to Self-Control:<br /><br />    1.  Never touch the intimate parts of your body except during<br />        normal toilet processes.<br /><br />    2.  Avoid being alone as much as possible.  Find good company<br />        and stay in this good company.<br /><br />    3.  If you are associated with other persons having this same<br />        problem, YOU MUST BREAK OFF THEIR FRIENDSHIP.  Never<br />        associate with other people having the same weakness.  Don't<br />        suppose that two of you will quit together, you never will.<br />        You must get away from people of that kind.  Just to be in<br />        their presence will keep your problem foremost in your mind.<br />        The problem must be taken OUT OF YOUR MIND for that is where<br />        it really exists.  Your mind must be on other and more<br />        wholesome things.<br /><br />    4.  When you bathe, do not admire yourself in a mirror.  Never<br />        stay in the bath more than five or six minutes -- just long<br />        enough to bathe and dry and dress AND THEN GET OUT OF THE<br />        BATHROOM into a room where you will have some member of your<br />        family present.<br /><br />    5.  When in bed, if that is where you have your problem for the<br />        most part, dress yourself for the night so securely that you<br />        cannot easily touch your vital parts, and so that it would<br />        be difficult and time consuming for you to remove those<br />        clothes.  By the time you started to remove protective<br />        clothing you would have sufficiently controlled your<br />        thinking that the temptation would leave you.<br /><br />    6.  If the temptation seems overpowering while you are in bed,<br />        GET OUT OF BED AND GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND FIX YOURSELF A<br />        SNACK, even if it is in the middle of the night, and even if<br />        you are not hungry, and despite your fears of gaining<br />        weight.  The purpose behind this suggestion is that you GET<br />        YOUR MIND ON SOMETHING ELSE.  You are the subject of your<br />        thoughts, so to speak.<br /><br />    7.  Never read pornographic material.  Never read about your<br />        problem.  Keep it out of mind.  Remember -- ""First a<br />        thought, then an act.""<br />                The thought pattern must be changed.  You must not<br />        allow this problem to remain in your mid.  When you<br />        accomplish that, you soon will be free of the act.<br /><br />    8.  Put wholesome thoughts into your mind at all times.  Read<br />        good books -- Church books -- Scriptures -- Sermons of the<br />        Brethern [sic, Cistern too?].  Make a daily habit of reading<br />        at least one chapter of Scripture, preferably from one of the<br />        four Gospels in the New Testament, or the Book of Mormon.  The<br />        four Gospels -- Matthew, Mark, Luke and John -- above<br />        anything else in the Bible can be helpful because of their<br />        uplifting qualities.<br /><br />    9.  Pray.  But when you pray, don't pray about this problem, for<br />        that will tend to keep [it] in your mind more than ever.  Pray<br />        for faith, pray for understanding of the Scriptures, pray<br />        for the Missionaries, the General Authorities, your friends,<br />        your families, BUT KEEP THE PROBLEM OUT OF YOUR MIND BY NOT<br />        MENTIONING IT EVER -- NOT IN CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS, NOT<br />        IN YOUR PRAYERS.  KEEP IT _OUT_ of your mind!<br /><br /><br /><br />        The attitude of a person toward his problem has an affect [sic] on how<br />easy it is to overcome.  It is essential that a firm commitment be made to<br />control the habit.  As a person understands his reasons for the behavior, and<br />is sensitive to the conditions or situations that may trigger a desire for the<br />act, he develops the power to control it.<br /><br />        We are taught that our bodies are temples of God, and are to be clean<br />so that the Holy Ghost may dwell within us.  Masturbation is a sinful habit<br />that robs one of the Spirit and creates guilt and emotional stress.  It is not<br />physically harmful unless practiced in the extreme. It is a habit that is<br />totally self-centered, and secretive, and in no way expresses the proper use of<br />the procreative power given to man to fulfill eternal purposes.  It therefore<br />separates a person from God and defeats the gospel plan.<br /><br />        This self-gratifying activity will cause one to lose his self-respect<br />testimony becomes weak, and missionary work and other Church callings become<br />burdensome, offerins.<br /><br />        To help in planning an effective program to overcome the problem a<br />brieation is given of how the reproductive organs in a young man function.<br /><br />        The testes in your body are continually producing hundreds of millions<br />of reproductive cells call _spermatozoa_.  These are moved up a tube called the<br />_vas deferens_ to a place called the _ampulla_ where they are mixed with fluids<br />from two membranous pouches called _seminal vesicles_ and the _prostate gland_.<br /> The resultant fluid is calleeminal vesicles are full a signa to the _central<br />nervous system_ indicating they are ready to benother, depending on such<br />thingsexercise, state of health, etc. everal times a week, for others<br />        It is normal for the vesicles to be emptied occasionally at night<br />durise the emptying come from the cetral nervous system. Often an erotic dream<br />is experienced at the same time, and is a part of this normal process. nstead<br />ourse, the reproductive system is operating at a more rapid pace, trying to<br />keep up with the loss of semen.  When he stops the habit, the body will<br />continue to produce ahis increased rate, for an indefese are not harmful and<br />are to be endured until the normal central nervous system pathway of rel<br />        During this period of control several things can be done to make the pr<br />       As one meets with his Priesthood Leader, a program for overcoming<br />masturbation can be implemented using some of t Remember it is essential that a<br />regur report program be agreed on, so progress can be recognized and failures<br />understood and eliminated.<br /><br /><br />                             Suggestions:<br /><br />    1.  Pray daily, ask for the gifts of the Spirit, that which will<br />        strengthen you against temptation.  Pray fervently and out<br />        lout when the temptations are the strongest.<br /><br />    2.  Follow a program of vigorous daily exercise.  The exercises<br />        reduce emotional tension and depression and are absolutely<br />        basic to the solution of this problem.  Double your physical<br />        activity when you feel stress increasing.<br /><br />    3.  When the temptation to masturbate is strong, yell _STOP_ to<br />        those thoughts as loudly as you can in your mind and then<br />        recite a prechosen Scripture or sing an inspirational hymn.<br />        It is important to turn your thoughts away from the selfish<br />        need to indulge.<br /><br />    4.  Set goals of abstinence, begin with a day, then a week,<br />        month, year and finally commit to never doing it again.<br />        Until you commit yourself to _never again_ you will always be<br />        open to temptation.<br /><br />    5.  Change in behavior and attitude is most easily achieved<br />        through a changed self-image.  Spend time every day<br />        imagining yourself strong and in control, easily overcoming<br />        tempting situations.<br /><br />    6.  Begin to work daily on a self-improvement program.  Relate<br />        this plan to improving your Church service, to improving your<br />        relationships with your family, God and others.  Strive to<br />        enhance your strengths and talents.<br /><br />    7.  Be outgoing and friendly.  Force yourself to be with others<br />        and learn to enjoy working and talking to them.  Use<br />        principles of developing friendships found in books such as<br />        _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ by Dale Carnegie.<br /><br />    8.  Be aware of situations that depress you or that cause you to<br />        feel lonely, bored, frustrated or discouraged.  These<br />        emotional states can trigger the desire to masturbate as a<br />        way of escape.  Plan in advance to counter these low periods<br />        through various activities, such as reading a book, visiting<br />        a friend, doing something athletic, etc.<br /><br />    9.  Make a pocket calendar for a month on a small card.  Carry<br />        it with you, but show it to no one.  If you have a lapse of<br />        self control, color the day black.  Your goal will be to<br />        have _no black days_.   The calendar becomes a strong visual<br />        reminder of self control and should be looked at when you<br />        are tempted to add another black day.  Keep your calendar up<br />        until you have at least three clear months.<br /><br />   10.  A careful study will indicate you have had the problem at<br />        certain times and under certain conditions.  Try and recall,<br />        in detail, what your particular times and conditions were.<br />        Now that you understand how it happens, plan to break the<br />        pattern through counter activities.<br /><br />   11.  In the field of psychotherapy there is a very effective<br />        technique called _aversion therapy_.  When we associate<br />        or think of something very distasteful with something which has<br />        been pleasurable, but undesirable, the distasteful thought<br />        and feeling will begin to cancel out that which was<br />        pleasurable.  If you associate something very distasteful<br />        with your loss of self-control it will help you to stop the<br />        act.  For example, if you are tempted to masturbate, think<br />        of having to bathe in a tub of worms, and eat several of<br />        them as you do the act.<br /><br />   12.  During your toileting and shower activities leave the<br />        bathroom door or shower curtain partly open, to discourage<br />        being alone in total privacy.  Take cool brief showers.<br /><br />   13.  Arise immediately in the mornings.  Do not lie in bed awake,<br />        no matter what time of day it is.  Get up and do something.<br />        Start each day with an enthusiastic activity.<br /><br />   14.  Keep your bladder empty.  Refrain from drinking large<br />        amounts of fluids before retiring.<br /><br />   15.  Reduce the amount of spices and condiments in your food.<br />        Eat as lightly as possible at night.<br /><br />   16.  Wear pajamas that are difficult to open, yet loose and<br />        not binding.<br /><br />   17.  Avoid people, situations, pictures or reading materials that<br />        might create sexual excitement.<br /><br />   18.  It is sometimes helpful to have a physical object to use<br />        in overcoming this problem.  A Book of Mormon, firmly held in<br />        hand, even in bed at night has proven helpful in extreme<br />        cases.<br /><br />   19.  In very severe cases it may be necessary to tie a hand to<br />        the bed frame with a tie in order that the habit of<br />        masturbating in a semi-sleep condition can be broken.  This<br />        can also be accomplished by wearing several layers of<br />        clothing which would be difficult to remove while half<br />        asleep.<br /><br />   20.  Set up a reward system for your successes.  It does not have<br />        to be a big reward.  A quarter in a receptacle each time you<br />        overcome or reach a goal.  Spend it on something which<br />        delights you and will be a continuing reminder of your<br />        progress.<br /><br />   21.  Do not let yourself return to any past habit or attitude<br />        patterns which were part of your problem.  _Satan Never Gives<br />        Up_.  Be calmly and confidently on guard.  Keep a positive<br />        mental attitude.  You can win this fight!  The joy and<br />        strength you will feel when you do will give your whole life<br />        a radiant and spiritual glow of satisfaction and fulfillment.</pre>"

"event","God is the Unknown.<br /><br /><br /><br />More than mere words, this is the utmost important message that must be spread; damn your Bible; damn your teachings: God is the Unknown.<br /><br /><br />The current model, or mythos, representing God, and any form of divine ideology, has long passed it's time. Believing that God gives a damn about your abortion, or your economy, or your life for that matter, is Draconian. What can truly be said about any worship is that it encompasses things we cannot explain. Take the classic Atheist vs. Theist conversation. It happens in second thirty-five:<br /><br /><i>Atheist: There is no God. God has never existed, and will never. You are all that you are.<br />Theist: But how does one explain what cannot be explained? Where does the universe come from, and what is it's intent?<br /><br /></i>Always, always, always: references to the unknown.<br />We knew it so, in the Dark Ages, that God was the conductor of human creation. Sexual intercourse was the ritual one engaged, to ask the Divine for a child (an argument can be made for the sexual repression by most religious sources to be an attempt to keep a ritual sacred, or in their eyes, not overpopulate the world). As we progressed through society, we learned about biology, and the maternal science. Thus, invalidating God as ""Creator"". On the other hand, it is not known to Man any ability to conjure matter by our own means, thus an argument can be made for the maintaining of God's ""Creator""-status.<br /><br /><br />What is the point? The point is that for all the egomaniacal prattle, and droning one encounters whilst turning a magazine page, or changing a television channel, or walking down the street, you are basically being subjected to cultism. The Christian model is most identifiable, in the States: the Catholics are almost self-worshipping, ergo, Satanists in the philosophical context; Protestants worship the Catholic Church; the Eastern Church continues with it's mix of pagan-laden Judeo-Christendom. From this, a case can be made that Christendom is dead, in it's natural state.<br />What we have now are the theses made from centuries-old copies of copies of copies, rife with mistranslation, tampering, and historical retractions. The faith is no longer based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, insofar as one can prove the teachings are based on John the Baptists' word. To hold to such dogmatic doctrinal evidence, in the face of documented errors, and revisions, almost completely invalidates one's religion in the first place. Thus, we are left with faith.<br /><br />The infinite abstraction of individual faith has consistently been the basis of historical strife: Christians and Muslims; Jews and Pagans; Eastern religion and Imperial Japan. Countless repressions and oppressions, executed in the name of singular faith in a replicated, and archaic document, for whom no one may vouch for veracity. The subtle nuances in one faith can spell decades of murder and genocide for another. We need only observe the on-going Islamic reformation in our own current events.<br /><br />Being as such, faith identified as individual definition, has no logical place in public discourse. One cannot engage in any religious sense, in broad daylight, without infringing upon the populace at large. Common-shared faiths are irrelevant as it is well within a person's right to meet in a group of people, and discuss commonly-shared ideas. Once this group begins organizing in societal structures, it has violated the individuality of the commonly-shared faith. It then becomes a self<i>-</i>aggrandizing instrument of idolatry; a mechanism to bask in one particular so-called ""magnificence"". The faith becomes institutionalized, and no longer a vehicle of personal strength, or values.<br /><br />The danger is easily visible, as we refer back to our learned history: Man has created society. Society is largely built upon groupings of groups, on the basis of common ideology. We, as social creatures, seek an affirmation from our fellow Man, to validate our own existence. While one can largely view this imperative as iconoclastic, itself, it is nevertheless there. We crave attention, and acceptance, and the quickest sure way is to surround ourselves with people that share our ideas. Uniformity provides a comfort, in that it offers nothing in the way of dissent. Restlessness eventually consumes the grouping, and achievements and goals are proposed. <br /><br /><br /><i>...to be continued.</i>"

Could-have-beens eat away in side, now... Praise God and pass the bottle of Beam, because tonight I can't seem to say what I mean.
Don't know if I would even if I could, Amen. Somehow this seems like borrowed time. Pay it no mind, everything is fine.
But sometimes I'd rather hear laughter while this whole place died
A Johnny Jump-Up is a lovely thing; a pint of cider and some whiskey. I had four dead inside of me just to hear this jackass sing his line about how he used to hang out somewhere ""back in the day"", knowing terms only that an asshole would say. So, I sat there drinking more; thinking about drinking more. Nelson Algren came to me and said ""Celebrate the ugly things"". The beat up side of what they call ""pride"" could be the measure of these days.

...God save Otis Redding, because I know he's never gone, as sick falls from this mouth: hear me sing it wrong. Is it ""cigarettes and coffee"" now, or Dreams to be Remembered? I'll leave regrets for dead and sing along.

So, I'm reaching for the phone; I don't want to be alone; I want to get some friends here tonight. I got a basement full of booze and some blues to lose. I'll ignore the whole world, tonight.

SID VICIOUS

Sid was allegedly the bassist for the Sex Pistols, though he was never recorded in the studio and was usually unplugged when playing on stage. His favorite things included his best friend Johnny Rotten until their band broke up, his girl Nancy until he stabbed her to death with a hunting knife, and heroin until his tragicomic overdose at the age of 21. Anti-celebrity incarnate, he still died like a stupid fucking rockstar, wondering why no one was paying him lots of money to shoot drugs, swear, and try to be clever for cameras that had long since lost interest.

Rotten.com spiritualists have received a special beyond-the-grave message from Sid to all of those hordes of alienated white boys who would give anything in the world to become that most mysterious of archetypes- the famous, nihilist punk rocker: ""A$ LONG AS EYE LIVE WITHIN U, PUNKZ NOT DED!@# FUCK 'THE QUEEN!'""

"event","I should have known our time had come and gone
Just move aside and let the young punks ride
The wave of adulation, in complete capitulation
We had our day; is there anything left to say?

I should have seen the videos on the screen
Selling out our souls for platinum green
Radio friendly and marketability, the new language of the scene
Punk was finally ""in"" said Rolling Stone and Spin 


Old punks don't die
...they just cash in


I must admit:
I don't go in the pit like I used to anymore
Stealing the bands beer to share out on the floor
I try to hang out, but I tire faster now

Yes I still believe
I have that punk disease
But fighting in the streets is so hard on the feet
I find my support greater smoozing backstage.

"event","The 411:

I haven't slept but once since Tuesday, Feb. 21st.
I'm nervous and edgy, and I think we're on the brink of nuclear annihilation.
A man in Pennsylvania was awarded a commuted sentence for killing 13 people in 1982, because of mental illness. He believes his sentence was commuted by God. Note to self: If ever charged with crime, convert back to Catholicism. Apparently, it works.
I'm getting a new apartment soon, and will be living alone; I'm scared to death.
I should be back in school in time for summer semester...again. Hopefully, this time, without defect.
I've been watching Chappelle Show religiously.
I'm nowhere near being done with the Satanic Verses.
I've grown addicted to real-time strategy war games; specifically Black and White II, and Warcraft III.
I have fifty minutes on my phone, so it's ok to call me and leave goofy messages, as I've yet to actually answer my cell phone.
The Chicago Cubs still suck.
I've written something like forty essays since I stopped using this site, seemingly discovering the problem with my style: I hate commentary.
My car still runs.
I'm looking for a new job, currently some children's party center named Boogey's.
If my tax check isn't spent on my car/apartment/school, completely, I'll get some ink. Or a dog. Or some booze.
I've drank two bottles of Wild Turkey since November. Somehow, I can still take an entire bottle of normal (80 proof) liquor, and still only feel buzzed.
I'm on the verge of realizing my dream, and buying a guitar. All I need is a trilby hat, and some Billy Joel tunes, and I'm set.
I've been listening to a lot of hip hop lately; if you have any Roots or Eryka Badu mp3s, send them to wobdarden@gmail.com .
I've been hanging out with anarchists, resulting in migraine headaches.
Anna Nicole Smith has a case being heard by the Supreme Court, and the press is actually covering it. Once again, the media really has it's finger on the pulse of the populace.
My new position on Iraq is: run far, far away, and hide underneath the bed.
The new Fugees album is the best thing you can ever hope to hear. The only negative effect is the manifestation of wonderment about what the hell happened to Pras after 'Ghetto Superstar'.
I haven't been to a bar since summer, which has really dampened my social stature. This is a trend I hope to break, tonight.
I've found evidence to support my ""Jesus in Asia"" theory.
If anyone has/can get the new A Global Threat album, please send it to wobdarden@gmail.com . I think the title has something to do with sunrises.
Despite not working out much this winter, I've toned up quite a bit. It's either that, or famine.
I've been seriously thinking about paying my traffic tickets.
I've also been thinking about insurance.
This means the death of my entire way of life.
Irshad Manji was on Real Time, Friday, and I still have a crush on her. All hail Canadian Muslim lesbians.
My favortie song at the moment is that one by Wyclef about being President, probably titled 'If I Were President'.
I have this giant zit on my eyebrow, which painfully reminds me, every morning, that my job really really sucks.
I've taken up riding, again, though not The Grind. I'm also contemplating buying a new bike. Probably the Mike Tag signiture frame.
I'm back to picking fights with skinheads in the Metallica chatroom, and locally, the pool hall where all the hicks hang out.
I've rediscovered a love for Van Morrison. And it stoned me.
I'm doing my own segment called ""'The Blues' Are..."", inspired by Henry Rollins, who famously said ""'The blues' is having your girlfriend leave you, and not having enough money to emmerse yourself in drink"". Also, partly, by my own personal experience: Meeting a woman that you instantly fall in love with, and then meeting her fiance. And discovering that he's a good person. Someone you'd hang out with. And that doesn't make you absolutely sick.
Speaking of Henry Rollins, he was recently added to an Australian Terrorist Watchlist, for reading a book about the rise of Islam in Asia Minor. After being informed of this, my hero wrote a letter to the office that conducts this watchlist, called their Prime Minister ""a pansy"", and told the entire country ""to go fuck themselves"".
I want the lyrics to the Dropkick Murphys' 'The Gangs All Here' inscribed on my tombstone.
If I don't stop this bullshit, and go take a shower, I'm going to be late for work.
I've decided that being late for work isn't the worst thing that can happen to me.
I've become of the opinion that Karl Marx was a madman.
Speaking of which, I've titled someone at work 'Tyler of the Proletariat' for offering an idea to start a worker's strike because management has made a rule against carrying cell phones at work.
I'm adopting a position of racial deconstruction. We setup government spawning grounds where black men and women sleep with white men and women, in an effort to blur the lines of race out of existence. It's certainly a better idea than listening to Walmart assistant managers throw a fit every time a black kid makes it into the local state university.
Anything that isn't somber, or played on an acoustic guitar, is really annoying the piss out of me. Wait an hour, until I'm at work, and all I'll want to hear is death metal. Find the connection.
I've noticed that I wear the same red Staples shirt, everywhere I go. People must think I work there, or am homeless.
I've been eating way too much, all this week. I'm starting to feel sick.
I've been cordially invited to a frat party, Friday. I cannot remember if I've accepted or declined, but I do recall comparing frats to circle jerks.
Someone tell me what the word ""albumis"" means.
OH SHIT, IT'S WAYNE BRADY, SON."

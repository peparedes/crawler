"event","Let's see not to much going on as of late. Wasn't able to go to the meet fri cause i couldn't get anyone to work for me but oh well life goes on. Found out though that i no longer have any jumper cables in my car which annoys me a lil bit since i swore i had some there before. NO big deal though the girl got a ride with the other girl that was waiting too and apparently she came back later and her dad or someone put in a new battery or something. Now i just gotta go buy a set of jumper cables or dig one up from around the house since we prob have a spare set somewhere in all the junk and crap. Sat was nice and slow had to run a few food baskets for my mother but other then that i just layed around all day and ended up rereading Ender's Game which is possible the best book i have ever read. Sunday pretty much the same thing cept had to waste an hour and a half for a fregging national honor society thing. Wasn't too bad though cause we just ripped on the speaker they had got in who decided to go on about how being an elementary principal is the best job you could ever have? Ya so we just made fun of him. Other then that pretty boring day with the hw and all.

 Rest of the week was pretty boring cept for the fact that Novi decided that there wasn't enough snow on the ground to have a snow day. The best part though was that when i left the roads in my sub still had a good three or four inches of snow on them and i'm sure that's real safe for the busses to drive on. What pissed me off even more though was that out of the entire KVC we were the only school  who didn't get a snow day. We def shoulda had a snow day but novi's just way to good for something like that, even when the roads are crap and they haven't even gotten around to plowing 10 mile yet. OH god were we pissed bout that. Well moving on i found out that i'm going to indoor states sat for the 4x200 which was pretty sweet since no one ever told me we had even qualified for it, luckily i got someone to work for me that day too. Yup that's pretty much it for now.

OH def some amazing pics but if you can't stand the sight of blood or some gore def do not look at this:

"event","Well vacations almost gone but it was used well. Didn't really do to much hung out with kenny couple times we ended up literally running to 711 cause we felt like it. In the process we got chased by a dog, meet some friends from school, honked at by several people driving by, ran into some random guy who was driving around high and so out of it, and debated bout ripping off a pink light someone had on their garage(we so should have taken that kenny) ya so it turned out to be a fairly interesting trip. OH also hung out with sherman for a few hours that was fun even though he still isn't moving much, we just played san andreas a lot and blew up a ton of shit so awesome. He's doing well though for all those who want to know, doesn't get out much and sits around a lot so try calling him at least once cause there really is only so much you can do during the day then when you run out it gets really boring. Also took a few walks around my sub and the forests at bout midnight cause i just felt like getting out. You know it's amazing how different it is when it's dark out and everythings quite, it's actually quite relaxing if you can get past the somewhat spooky feeling since there literally is almost no one out. Really the only other thing i did was head up to MSU last night to hang out with my bro. That was actually fairly interesting, we ended up just hanging out in his room but one of his friends came over and we watched road trip, van wilder, and tried to watch not another teen movie but we were just weren't feeling right so we feel asleep through part of it. Gotta go up again though cause we have to go out next time instead of staying in, it was still pretty cool though. Ya other then that i pretty much stayed at home, watched some tv, read a lot, worked out a lil, and unfortunately robotics still. Over all very relaxing and just what i needed after bout a month of no free time and way to much stress and shit, now we just get to see if i can keep from getting stressed out again."

"event","Ah well boring school day like usual didn't do much. And of course i worked out after school which royally sucked since i haven't even run since monday and we ended up doing jump circuits today. Ya doesn't help when you run two miles before and lift after either. So get home run around try to get stuff ready for sledding, get the tubes down and fill em up and guess what one has a hole in it. So how do you fix a hole? Duct tape of course cept didn't work as well as i hoped cause it still deflated. Sledding was fun though cept alex had to go and freakin pop the only decent tube i had left, he got a nice bruise for doing it too, not from me though. Ya not much else bout sledding so got home and ended up going to see alone in the dark which royally sucked. I mean this was just bad, plot sucked, graphics sucked, and the action scenes were brutal. So headed to BW's after to get some wings and of course neville, larson, and andy decide not to count their wings before hand and get screwed up. But since kenny and i have some intelligence we split ours up before we started eating. Then andy in all his brilliance discovers he's short three bucks so larson pays since apparently he owed andy or something. Ya i don't know but it took  long time to figure out who was paying what. Def just a messed up trip. Well i think that's more then enough so i'm going to bed since my legs are sore as hell and i'm half asleep right now."

ALright well main things, robotics sucks like usual, school sucks even more, and sarah and i are just friends now, it was great but our lives are just too screwed up to try and keep going, sorry it didn't work out. Wow well that's a great recape of three weeks worth of stuff. Well aside from trying to balance robotics, ya i really hate that right now, ap bio, pre calc enriched, track conditioning/practice, and whatever else that likes to pop up like act workshops my life hasn't been too bad, see what i mean by my life being a lil screwed up? Ya welll i guess you could say i've been a lil stressed out as of late, and the consistent late nights haven't helped much. Hopefully with break coming up and the end of robotics (FINALLY!!!!)I should at least start to get my life back still might take a while though. Oh me and coleman are trying to get a soccer zone team going for spring or whenever talk to me if you wanna try it out."

"event","Well fairly dull weekend. Finals sucked but did well in chem and pretty good in cad so lifes not too bad. Really noting else happened fri cause of damn robotics, and what a waste of time that was. Saturday woke up went to robotics and then work. WOw was work boring but hey still made decent tips compared to tuesday which i got paid jack. Then of course right after work go to church, parents feel the sudden erge for red lobster so we go wait 30 mins when we were supposed to wait an hour. Dinner wasn't bad cept my dad had to bring up the pair of hip hugger jeans my mom got and how she now needs to get a shirt that shows them off. Ya brent and i really didn't feel like eating much after that. After dinner watched troy which was surprising pretty good even though some people had said it was kinda bad. Kinda funny cause kelly just happened to be watching it at the same time. Ya kinda feel asleep in front of the tv after the movie too. Alright well today tim woke me up cause we were supposed to go paintballing but the place had some crappy hours so we decided to go to the other field. Went back to sleep and woke up half hour before i was supposed to go. Drove all the way out there pull in and there are cars parked everywhere, there were cars even in the drive way in so only one car could go through at a time. There were people parked every where it was nuts. So i drive across the street, park and leave all my stuff in the car. As i'm walking across the street i see there sign and it says they're having a five man tournament. ya walk in and the place is packed, people standing all over, every table loaded with gear, people standing along the nets watchin, just a mess. So i sit around watch a few games and head home since there is no way we were gonna get a chance to play. That just royally sucked since i haven't played in a while and really wanted to test out my A-5. So i spend the rest of the day laying around watching tv, and siting in front of the comp. God i so wanted to play paintball today, well i guess we'll just have to find some other time.

Tim, i think we kinda got shafted today i mean what the hell is the chance that both fields have something going on???"

"event","Alright last free weekend, Joy. Friday school sucked especially after a snow day but hey it's friday so it can't be that bad. Got home and layed around then sprinted around getting everything ready for the meet. WOw did it ever suck driving out there. I def gotta leave earlier cause traffic just sucks, plus i had no idea where i was going aside from some pretty bad directions from my coach. Eventually i got there though and surprisingly i wasn't late. Well started and did high jump first but i neglected to warm up so i did some quick stretches and somehow cleared 5'6"" on my first attempt. Took a few more for 5'8"" but i still cleared it. Wasn't so lucky with 5'10"" though of course i had to give up my spikes and do it in sneakers since i still had one insert in one of my spikes. Still i took 4th even though i hadn't jumped in bout 7 months. Then joy i get to sit around for 4 hours actually prob closer to 5 cause they was a shit load of people doing the 60, half mile, and the mile. I just sat around the whole time and started warming up way to early. Finally when we got to our race. Wasn't too bad for some reason i anchored but oh well hand off went well least it did when you look at some of my other ones. Race wasn't bad aside from how sharp those damn turns are, I mean even at a 200 pace they kill your ankles and feet. Then of course we ran the 4x400 and i was the only kid who had ever run it before. Wow that was just sad to watch, cause they all ran the 100 and 200 so a  400 is a stretch for them. Still they didn't do too bad for their first time but wow did i ever get a bad time. I split a 57 with a 27 first 200 and a 30 for the second, pretty shitty when i finished last year with split a 52 and even with the wind i could do a 54. Prob means nothing to almost all of you but it was kinda disappointing for me even with the unbelievably sharp turns. ALright enough bout the meet, hung out at my cousins for like 10 mins after cause my bros were there, had some pizza and watched some poker, but had to leave cause it was like 11:30. Pretty lucky too cause i got home with bout 1 min before midnight. Ya pretty much ended the night aside from a lil talking online.

Sat started out as a very shitty day. Woke up at 6 AM!!!! Def not something i like to do but i had a freakin robotics thing that i had to go to. Yes i'm in robotics and no i don't really like it and yes i do kinda wanna quite. Well i basically sat around a lot made people sign in and pass out crap then watched some random people talk, actually pretty much slept. Finally after a long long time found out what the game was, and then after eating lunch i went home even though i was prob supposed to stay. Wow it was def a waste of time, would have been so much more productive if i had just slept in instead. Not much happened after that, dad had a work party i put in mr. deeds for some of the kids then i went to danielle's hockey game. Hooked up with sarah, kelly, and cher there. Wow ya sarah and kelly you really need to pay attention a lil more cause you were five feet from the door and facing it but still missed me. ALright had fun there cher prob had more screaming out the lil crack in the wall. Had a good time just hanging out messing around and listening to sarah and cher yell at the players, and she def missed some of the ice shavings over by us. Well northville won and we just hung around afterwards made sure to stand in the way of all the players coming out of the locker rooms too. That was pretty much it for sat

SUnday like usually woke up went to church, slept through most of that. Lil later went to a nursing home and helped pass out christmas presents to all the people there. Came home and for the most part just layed around the entire day, watched tv, looked at movie previews, and talked to a few people. That's pretty much it def a nice and relaxing day. Just wish i'ld be getting more of them but thanks to robotics i wont have much free time at all. WOw if it weren't for my parents and how good it looks to a college there is no way in hell i would be doing it anymore. Oh well unfortunately i'm still in it so if you don't talk or see me much for the next six weeks or so it's cause i'm being tormented at the three hour meetins we have mon-thurs and four hours sat. Worst part is it's not after school they start at 6, joy. Please just kill me now or at least get me sick. But not to sick cause i do wanna do track in march. Okay ya way to much going on in my life right now."

"event","Alright well didn't get around to this for a while but ohwell not that big of a deal. Well my parents were getting so stressed out before cause both sides of the family were coming over. Of course i didn't really care i didn't even wrap presents till christmas eve. Well actually i wrapped them at 12:30 so technically it was christmas. No big deal still got enough sleep. Woke up and got cinnamon rolls that my grandma made, wow those things are so damn good. Well opened presents and really didn't get that much cause of my ring and my paintball gun. That's all i really wanted though. My mom's side came over later and we just hung out opened a few presents and once again i didn't get that many but this time cause they were getting me a nitro tank, which i just ordered on line. Oh and one of the few presents i did get my cousin's lil baby opened by accident and they couldn't figure out what it was, ya that was soooooo funny. Ya that pretty much ended it watched some texas holdem and some six handed euchre.
Day after was pretty much the same cause my dad's side came over. This time though i did get a few presents, and i got my new paintball gun. That thing is def sweet and i can't wait till i can go play. Alright well it was pretty boring and kinda annoying cause my cousin's kids are brats and like to run around and scream. Ya finally everyone left and y grandparents came back and we stayed up till 12 play euchre. Of coures i couldn't just go to sleep so i pulled out my new game and my brother brian, his girlfriend, and i stayed up till 3 playing it. Well when the goal of the game is to make as big of an explosion as you can it's hard to put down. 
Monday started out nice woke up late then played the game for a few hours actually brian played it most of the time and he ended up leaving four hours after he thought he was going to, oh well shit happens. Ya i just layed around most of the day, cept later took sarah out to see a movie and what a screwed up movie it was. Oh well just spending time with her was more then i could wish for. That was pretty much all for monday, tuesday i just woke up and took out the dog my bro is watchin, then layed around all day till work. Yup work was boring just as usually and getting paid made up for it. Then of course i finished out the night with a good hour and a half at least talk with sarah on the phone. I lived every min of it too."

"event","ah a lil late but oh well. Alright friday, wasn't too bad i finally decided to go to the movie even though sarah wasn't there. Except half hour before i was gonna leave my dad tells me there's a sale at gander mountain and there are some great deals going on. SO go up there spend a lot of time looking around and get a few things for my new paintball gun. Well that ended up taking longer then i thought and when i finally left i got to emagine with no time left i mean the movie had already started. So tickets were sold out and we had to get another movie but hey no one was looking so we walked in. Good movie though it was a lil confusing but that was mainly because the kids next to us took cher's seat and a few other things that kept you from watching the movie. Afterwards just pretty much hung out ate ice cream and stood inside buffalo wild wings. Finally brenden asked danielle out and of course it was five mins after i left, oh well least he did it took him long enough though. 

Saturday, ya don't remember what happened much on saturday. I think i just hung out in the morning and did a few things around the house. Oh well not important anyways. Ended up going to danielle's hockey game with sarah and kelly. Ya that was fairly interesting. A lot different from guy's hockey but still not bad. We just hung out around the rink and watched the game, northville got killed. Had some fun on sarah's fun with all her messages and changing the language. Still don't think she knows how to change that but hey it's not my phone. Over all it was fun, that game wasn't really pretty but sarah def was.

Sunday, another slow day slept in went to the late mass and then went to my uncles and just hung out. Played a lil six handed euchre and talked to my cousin bout going paintball sometime. Ya that was pretty much my whole weekend and not much else has happened."

"event","Well didnt start out as such a bad day. I mean ya went to school and all but first block we just did a lab, second i pretty much slept through the lecture but it's all good cause i just read the book and learned everything in bout ten mins apposed to her 50 min lecture. Chem easy as always same with cad and that was pretty much it. Finally got a freakin hair cut but i had to cut off fannon just to get out of the freakin parking lot, sorry bout that steve. I know realize why i stay after soo much, the parking lot is such a bitch to get out of. Well ended up having to wait a half hour to get my hair cut but it wasn't too bad, and my hair looks a lot better especially since it had gotten so long. Alright well after that crammed most of my hw in and talked to a few people. And of course ten mins before i leave my mom calls out and she realizes that i'm working today so my shirt is still in the washing machine. Oh that was a real nice surprise, so i grab my shirt and apron and toss it in the dryer while she says she'll ""rush"" home but thankfully she just calls back and tells me what to set it on. So i wait a lil bit but turned out to be more then a lil so i try to rush out but my mom just keeps teling me to slow down and she tells me to put on an undershirt cause heaven forbid i should wear a wet shirt. So finally she gives up, i toss my shirt on run for my car and push the limit of not spinning out on the ice that still covers the roads in my sub. Thankfully i get there just in time and what do ya know fifteen mins later my shirt is perfectly dry and no one even noticed. The rest of work really wasn't that bad. Untill i realize that it's 8 oclock and there are still bout 10 tables left in the restaurant. Ya really didn't start cleaning up till 9 but luckily i was able to get most of it done. So while i'm waiting for the last people to get up three more people coming almost running in at 9:35, twenty five mins before we close. They push past the waitress who is trying to give them a table and pretty much ignore her and walk right past the wet floor sign that i put to show where i had just cleaned. It's funny cause the floors were still wet but didn't matter to them. And of course they get ice cream but instead of eating it and leaving they spend half an hour talking so that four of us couldn't even leave till 10 after 10. Of course i still had to clean up the floors so i basically bs the floors and get it done in less then half the time it usualy takes and get the hell outta there. So after some reckless driving, i pull in and walk in at 10:30 and guess what time my dad deemed the best time to use the computer? Ya he was sitting there on the comp when i walked in even though i had been gone since 5 and even though my unfinished hw was sitting right in front of him. So i try and wait and get sick of it so i just take a shower and thankfully he was done by the time i got out. SO here i am, hw got done bout 5 mins ago and trying to vent whatever anger i have left at the people who must have an iq equivalent to a brick, and that's insulting to a brick. Alright time for bed now."

So ended up going to laser tag and as soon as i get on ten mile brenden calls. Turns out he couldn't drive so i had to go all the way around nine mile and down taft cause ten mile was packed. So we finally get going and we get there just a tad late, maybe like a half hour or so but hey it's all good since they were playin ddr and i think sarah was trying to play a motorcycle game but that really didn't turn out too well. Finally we get started and i don't think the guy really like any of us especially cher since it was like school or something? Well anyways i had fun shooting dani a lot haha must've sucked. Second game was better and not sure where pop rocks came from but hey who cares, neville got cornered and supposable raped? Not sure what happened there. When we finally ended up leaving somehow i passed them on the way back even though they left like 5 mins before us, then of course i freakin missed the house wow that was sad. Anyways many fun times just hanging out, i mean with the ping pong paddles, the pillow fights, and the laying around how can you not? Of course i guess chils tried to sleep, emphasis on tried.

Sat pretty dull not much happened just went and did some errands with my dad. Got my oil changed, some gas, and all new tires just in time for the snow. Thank god he paid for it all. WEll other than that kinda boring day cept watched DODGEBALL. Then in the middle of the movie sarah and danielle call me and try to get me to listen to some messed up song that i can't even hear. Sarah you'll just have to play it for me some other time. Ah dodgeball what a great movie alt endin was sooo stupid. After the movie i had to run back home and talk to the wangs who came back from japan, and then go back and play halo for a lil while. ya that was pretty much it for sat, sunday has been dull just church and a lot of snow. Thank god for those new tires. Now i'm just waiting till i get to go to work, joy."

"event","Wow ya def been a crazy weekend, and it's not even over yet. So started off fri school sucked like always. Stayed after for sprint conditioning. Ya def not fun, we did three sets of jump circuits(very, very shitty). Def ranks up there as one of the hardest workouts i have ever done and just as bad as soccer tryouts. So after i finished killin myself, all the usually lifting, and a nice shower went over to sarah's. Spice world???? Ya please never again, although not sure if you'll be able to since i think kenny hid the tape, prob shouldn't have said that but oh well. GOod times with the block wars, and the walrus don't even remember it's name since it only showed up for what thirty seconds? Kenny i swear that it was laughing not crying. Alright so after that we head outside even though it was thirty degrees outside. Wondered around for a while and end up on top of some messed up pipe structure. And of course all the girls complained bout the cold, ooh and nice job of heatin the bar up neville. Finally the girls decided it was too cold and we went back, um ya sarah not sure how it's so scary if you know they're there? Ya that's pretty much it cept for sarah and denielle's twisted head banging to random music?? Ah yes def a good time.

So onto today, not too much went on today. Helped my dad start putting up our christmas lights, ya i know we're a lil late but at least we're puttin them up. Finished that actually no we still got a lot of lights left to put up but i had to work. Turned out to be the slowest day i have ever worked. I think i helped bout 20 people in the whole five hours i was there. Thankfully sarah, danielle, kelly, and steph came though cause it was really starting to get boring. Got out very early too which was cool and since then i haven't moved much. Just talked to people and heard bout some of the crazy stuff the girls were doing, i wont say since some of it is prob just a lil embarrassing. Def a nice weekend, if only i didn't have to hang the rest of the lights tom oh well it's not too bad. Oh ya and just to let you know how bad the workout was fri it hurts to go up or down stairs and if i sit for too long i almost can't get up."

Ya chem was just as boring but i survived and cad ya that's a blow off like always. The bitch though was conditioning. Ya that's right track conditioning has started already, god it's early. Wow you'ld think that because we ran indoors it couldn't be that bad but it was hell. We ran three sets six 40's with 20 push-ups after each one except for the last for the first set and then 10 after each for other two sets. Wow i couldn't even do all of them without takin a knee for quite a few. Really hard workout when you haven't done push ups in almost 7 months and then doing 200 while sprinting in between. Ya let's just say i was slightly tired but notin two advil couldn't help. Alright well after that i crammed some hw in there and tried to talk to people but didn't get much done before work. Luckily work was really dull and i got out early so here i am sitting around doin nothin since all the people i was talkin to are wimps and went to bed early, weaklings."

Ya i my whole entire weekend consisted of sleeping, reading, watching tv, playing video games, and of course playin euchre. Great time especially after having so much to do lately. Even better since sarah and ben came up. Ya so it was just a nice weekend, ended up watching walking tall, the whole ten yards, mean girls, and part of the stepford wives. Walkin tall was good and the whole ten yards was really funny, mean girls wasn't bad especially since lindsey lohan looked very nice. The stepford wives though was a really wierd movie and i don't think it was that good. Oh and i definitely ate a lot, I mean there was thanksgiving which you always eat a lot on then the next day my grandma makes dumplins and there is no way you can't eat a ton of those. Kinda worried though cause i ate soo much and just layed around all weekend so i really wanna get in the weight room tom. Other then that i didn't do anything just hung out with my bro and talked to sarah, over all a good weekend."

Ya so i gave in and did it then she came out and gave me forty dollars for it, def willing to cut her grass again. Ya did nothing after that just went to work and made some decent money there.

"event","Well friday started out nice, killed myself working out. Although i must say my legs were fine afterwards even though i did a massive leg workout that hurt like hell at the time. Ya don't really remember what i did after that but eventually i ended up going to fountain walk. Ya that's right i went to fountain walk yet again and wow is it sad when you can walk outside and completely miss a large group of slightly hyper girls. Well after waiting for a long time till everyone showed up we went to see a movie, Supposedly watch boobie get injured and then his team utterly fail at football by missing state champs by what was it six inches or so??? Y wouldn't you just nail the guy from behind to push him in? Oh and of course the puddle jumping or water slide for tim. Somehow i stayed fairly dry though, guess i'm just not cool enough to get drenched while it's about 40 degrees outside, and of course caroline in all her wisdom made a nice lil print on the soakin wet bench. Oh well great times.

Of course sat i get the pleasure of wakin up at 8 so i can go help my mom deliver thanksgiving baskets for church. Nice to know that i can do volunteer hours without ever volunteering. Well after that i had work which was pretty much a joke although the disher did just walk out half way through, he wasn't really doing much anyways. Well shortly after i get home i end up going to 5 o'clock mass. Then after picking kenny up i went straight over to danielle's house for yet another night of hanging out. Ya you'ld think i'ld get sick of them but i wont be home all next week really so mine as well hang out now. Ha a fun time there playing ddr, trying to get sarah to play oh just wait i will get you to play it and you will get good eventually, looking for kenny's watch which he somehow got stuck in a corner of a coach under the cushions, and of course simply talkin for a long time bout whatever the hell came to mind."

Or the people who come late and feel that cause they don't wanna go home the people working shouldn't either. I mean come on, if you wanna talk there are great places open late or we have some cool rocks right out side that you can sit on, it's not like it was cold out tonight anyways, it was 55 when i left. I really wanna kill those people and the best part my manager agrees with me. When they finally left i heard a swear word or two and a definite jesus christ, keep in mind this is a mother of an infant in her 30's so this was a big deal. Ya i better not catch anyone i know doing that or i will hurt you and it wont be pretty."

"event","Alright so started off the weekend pretty crappy. Football got screwed since i got there very late and practically no one showed up. So did nothing for a while then went to the game. Wow what a nice game, i show up it's still the first quarter and we're already getting our ass kicked. So once i found sarah, danielle, and cher we just hung out the whole time. Ya Tom was a lil strange but still a great kid to know. The score ended up being like 10 to 42 which is very crappy but hey i don't care. I didn't watch the game that much had more fun just hanging out. Ended up talkin for an bout a half hour after the game and watching the hicks play hackie sack with what looked like a tea bag. Ya very funny. Well after that i went over to hoptons for a massive halo party. Somthing like 11 guys all night playing halo 2. Ya it was insane, we had so much fun i don't think we stopped till bout 6 am. Then i finally got bout an hour of sleep till tim started screaming and crap so everyone got back up and just went home. 

Ya I tried to get some sleep but i only got about two hours cause i had a freakin dermo appt at 10:30. So went there then went to work and hung out there with the people on break for a lil while. Unfortunately when i got home i got screwed over with having to cut the bushes next door. Ya it has never been that bad but just when i was getting ready to leave after two hours my parents come over and decide to help and cut the rest of the bushes. So i spent another wonderful hour bundling the damn bushes. We have so many bundles that it the pile is almost as high as the fence and about four feet deep by eight feet long, ya it's a shit load of branches. Well after that lovely incident i went to fountain walk with sarah, danielle, neville, and sherman showed up after a lil while. We ended up simply lurking around till we decided to see a movie. Ya we get there half hour early get our tickets for THe Incredibles and just stand around and talk. What really sucked though was when we went to the theatre there was a huge ass line to get in, even though it came out a week ago. So we get screwed over with being last in line and get some very bad seats. Ya never sitting front row again, oh and we all know what the first thing that comes to sarah's mind when we talk bout big shoes. It was a good movie just bad seats. We didn't do much after but i did end up talkin to them for a while online. 

Sunday was a nice relaxing day although i did have to wake up for church. otherwise i didn't do much aside from talk to a lot of people online for a very long time and clean up the mess we made yesterday cutting the bushes. Very funny though to listen to a song and having someone typing it too you at the same time. Ya just a nice relaxing day. Very busy weekend but hey i don't care it was fun. Just wish all weekends were like it."

"event","Well this was the weekend for football. Friday after school like i've done for the past three weeks i played football. Actually didn't play as much as usually but i had to get my neighbors grass cut first so i had to set priorities and i was getting paid to cut the grass so money came first. And like usually after playing we went to watch the game, all the way out if freakin canton. Ya that was a long drive. Oh well great game, we killed them 20-0 even though they were undefeated, and were chosen to win. Then of course we went to fountain walk except we mixed it up this time and went to bw's instead of hooters. I think bw's has better wings but hooters is still better. Ya that was pretty much all we did friday.

Saturday, very interesting day. Woke up at 7:30 wow that sucked. After sitting around for an hour we went down to ann arbor for some tailgating. Of course since we were supposed to be with a bunch of recently graduated college frat guys none of them made it there any where near to on time. Once they did get there though beer and whatever else was there started to flow and they all started to get pretty happy. Ya i did have some to drink but really it wasn't much. Pretty much just hung out and had fun, even skipped the first half of the game, Grand Valley vs Michigan Tech. Wasn't that exciting of a game since Grand Valley ended up killing them a lot like novi did to canton since Michigan Tech was undefeated and supposed to win. Afterwards we spent a few hours grilling some deer meat, tossing the football, drinking a lil more, and just hanging out. I drove home since i hardly drank anything and everyone else was a lil drunk. Got home and what do you know brian and his frat bros want to go to hooters so i join. Spent a few hours there had some fun, headed over to a bar and had some more fun. My mom called bout 3 times while we were gone, wow very protective mother. Ya that was all for sat but i was way to tired to do anything else. 

Sunday not much happened, called into work for 4 hours since no one was scheduled so made some money. Came home chopped some bushes down, went to church, did my hw, and watched the cell. Ya very boring day but very relaxing.

Today, school and a test in trig. Plus i did some massive lifting after school and now i'm bout ready to die. But hey that's alright since i get to go work for 5 hours bussing so well see just how far i can push my body today. If i'm not back for a few days prob cause i'm to sore to move."

"event","Ah yes fun times of late. Thurs went to kenny's for the weekend and thanks to kenny's genius got San Andreas takin away cause he thought we could some how play it while his mom was awake. So couldn't play that and had to resort to SSX tricky which i did get fairly good at. Pretty much all the excitement there.

Friday was great, after we got out of school it was time for a few hours of football like always. Best time yet cause we split it up into two separate games with 4v4 on each field. Played a round robin type tourney and my team did very well until we lost one of our guys cause he twisted his ankle then we lost the championship by a close margin. Ah well life goes on. Then after some pizza a nice shower, it was a tad bit muddy out, and some tv it was time for the game. Ah yes the novi-northville game, of course we killed again but a lil more this time since it was a regional game. I think i actually watched one full quarter of it then went to northville's side to talk to everyone and to rip on them for being so awful. Great times mainly with keepin glow sticks away from the girls, until sarah stuffed it up her shirt. Pretty safe place too until amanda made a try for it, very interesting to watch made the 5 dollar entree completely worth it. Somehow how i ended up getting it back but  before we left i gave it away since they were so amazed by a glowing piece of plastic. Oh and next time i'll be sure to have plenty of I <3 HOOTERS stickers, didn't think there would be such a great need for them. And of course as is becoming somewhat of a tradition we went to hooters after for some good breast and legs. Ah what a great day, if only all fridays were that much fun.

Saturday- Very interesting day with the michigan-michigan state game. Very close and so funny with kenny's mom. She was dancing and singing the state fight song then michigan made their sweet come back and won the game. I don't think i've ever heard that house so quite, it was so incredably hard not to laugh at them. After that it was time for heff's surprise party. I of course show up late and actually only mins before heff did. Great time though, with the ddr, and the N64 tetris, and the pool.

Sunday- ya boring day even though it was halloween. Finally went home, but soon after i had work. Very interesting day at work though since everyone was supposed to dress up. I of course went as a soccer player cause everything else was either too scary, too small, or not exactly the best clothing for bussing. Some pretty funny costumes though and with the very dull day it made for plenty of time to talk and just hang out, possibly the best day of work yet. Ya that was pretty much my weekend, actually friday was pretty much my weekend since the rest of the time i didn't do much.

Monday- Okey school sucked like always, trig quiz on some extraordinarily boring equations that i can never see myself using. Chem lab with the penny's was fun though, ya ours never turned out right though, even after three tries. Then after kenny calling my house three times even once while we were eating i went to his house for some halo. Pretty fun with 5 on 5 but sucked when sam had to take his x box. Then when i got home definitly time for some San Andreas, which i got back sunday when i left ken's. Played for a solid two hours and love the game so much now. 

Tuesday- Thanks so greatly to the elections there was NO SCHOOL!!!!! Gladly capitalizing on this prime opportunity i slept until at least 11(about ten hours of sleep) Helped out at my grandparent's for a while, mainly watched tv since they didn't have that much for us to do. Then of course some more San Andreas when i got home. Oh and apparently all kids who are cool are spoiled and like ice cream, anyone that doesn't is in the reject category. Ya definitely a lil messed up logic happenin there.

And finally today Wednesday- Pretty much a useless day school, then kenny being annoying once again since i couldn't go to football. Of course since i have work i do need some time to do my hw and talk to people and since i've played football so much already i skipped it, would have been hard though to leave in time for work. Then work yet again, dull day but got to mock a few of the waitress, such a great job when you get to make fun of your co workers and not face any consequences or making them mad."

"event","IT's been a very eventful weekend cept for sat, that was just boring with work and not much else. Well fri after school and all we decided to go play football. Not just a lil bit of football but 2 and a half hours of full tackle football with at least 14 guys at all times. YA needless to say we beat the shit out of eachother and had a ton of fun doing it. Screwed up my elbow when putty landed on it, think i might have jammed it or something cause it still hurts a lil when i bend it too far. My only injury so i'm happy. Once we got over letting out a weeks worth of pent up aggression on eachother and a long shower headed up to the football game to watch northville get killed(just as i said they would). It ended up being 35 to 7 novi with them not scoring until the fourth quarter when we were just giving all our second line guys a chance to play. Ya it was nice especially when your on the northville side messing with some friends and making sure they know how badly they're losing. Ah good times, of course we saw fit to go to hooters afterwords to finish off the night. And what a finish it was, i mean the YMCA and all and murphie doing the chicken dance after much deliberation and nagging from their waitress. Next time though kenny don't try and get all serious when we're sitting their watching all the hot women working there, it just doesn't go over so well.

Like i said sat was dull: work, watch day after tom(good movie), and see my bro's new lever action. Sadly no late night 711 runs this week. Sunday however made up for it. Get up and drive a ways, actually i slept my dad drove, till we get to the apple orchard and end up waiting for the rest of my family to get there. Once everyone showed up and we ate enough doughnuts, took enough pictures, and tossed the football around enough we headed out to pick some apples. Of course being so late in the year we pretty much got screwed over with the selection of apples available to us. So after a lot of climbing, messing around and a lil more football we got enough apples to satisfy my mother, grandmother, and my aunts. Then came the party at my uncles house they got a few months ago, we basically celebrated two of my cousins birthday, had some sloppy joe and some cake, played some more football, rode their new four wheeler and watched the bon fire. Uneventful yet still worth the time. Unfortunately i being the unimaginably intelligent teen that i am left all my hw till tonight so i crammed 20 pgs of ap bio, the questions that went with them, an entire trig assignment, and study time for the ap bio quiz, trig test, and ap bio essay i have tom. Somehow i did it all before 12 too so i'm gonna go pass out on my bed now."

It might be simple but just driving to 711 getting a slurpee or something then randomly driving around isn't too bad and prob much better then sitting at home. Add to it with going to a friends house and knocking on their window while there or ding dong ditching them can turn a very boring night into something actually worth while."

Well who ever is that random or insane(prob tim) created a game that is a hell of a lot fun and whatever kenny says it does not hurt or burn that much when you get hit by one, he's just a lil baby who can't take it. Bon fires are always nice too but a bitch to restart even with a can of spray paint. Of course not much beats lighting off slightly illegal fireworks within sight of novi road and never even having the cops drive by. To top off a night of fun was of course capture the flag, kidnap was just to confusing to figure out with 10 guys so we went with the lazy choice and played a game of capture the flag in an area prob way to big for it.Always good times when hanging out with friends although sherman needs to start doing it more if only he would try calling me when i don't have things going on."

"event","Ya well a lot has gone on lately. Homecoming was saturday and wow that was sweet. We killed harltand and i pretty much lost my voice at the game but the parade was sweet and our float definitely dominated even with it getting hit by a cable wire five feet too short. Then came the dance. Ya going stag really sucked at first. Spent some time wondering around talking to people, finally found a group to hang out with. Watched some really messed up dancing by some people who could care less about making a fool of themselves, very very entertaining. Ya after that broke up i finally went out and danced with some people a lil with elise and amanda, i think i pissed kenny off a lil bit. That didn't last too long since with a lil help i meet a girl from harrison and danced with her for the rest of the time. Sadly, no real after party just hung out at elises and left by 11:45 since i drove myself. Ya that law about being off the road by 12 is complete bullshit. Almost forgot WE WON THE FLOAT CONTEST!!!! That's right our float rocked and no seniors the parents didn't do much of it and no we did not have a contractor/electritian/hired help. 

ALright that was pretty much all i did for homecoming not much else has happened just the piston's game, which i just got back from. It was sadly a close game. We lead the game for the first quarter by over 20 points then the entire second half we were down until the last 6 seconds when they scored a 3 point shot and put us in the lead by 2. Ya luckily boston screwed up their final shot and lost the game after getting so close. Well it's about 12, i gotta work tom, take a chem test, and i am starting to feel tired."

Ryan and i did a ton of work on it along with quite a few other people and while it might have been a lot of fun it was still hard work Oh and i most definitely suffer from a massive lack of sleep due to the fact that i spend so much time there i neglect my hw and end up going to bed at 12 pretty much every night. Aside from the lack of sleep this week has been great with the toga, the dyed hair, the massive wave of red in the hallways today, and of course whatever the hell i'm wearing tom.

"event","Wow ya this weekend was pretty crazy. Started with going to kenny's pretty much right after school, then once i dropped some of my crap off i went to float building. Did quite a bit even though we had like 5 kids there. After that went to the football game, which i don't even remember the score too since i never paided attention to the game. I don't really care bout football that much it was just fun to hang out with everyone. Football really isn't that exciting till the last two mins anyways the rest is just a reason to hang out with people. Ya so sat i just spent the day working, and playing halo with tim, nick, and ken. 

Now on sunday that was when all the cool shit happened. Let's see we woke up lil after 9 am cause we had to get ready. Tim went home to get his shit, i went to get my shit and kenny pretty much stayed at home and prob wasted his time doing what he prob usually does when he's alone. Ended up getting to futureball bout 11:30 tim was already there but larson being the idiot that he his went to the freakin indoor place so they spent an extra half hour getting to the outdoor field. After that though it was just us shooting the shit out of people, a lil backyard football in the dead zone, and quite a few good stories. I still think castle and jungle were the best fields we played since i did pretty sweet in both of them. Oh and for all those pussies who think outdoor is violent and getting hit while playing outdoor hurts try speed ball. Only played for a half hour tops and i walked off with four bruises, and one that will prob last a while. OH and for future reference for whoever plays, DON'T EVER WALK TOWARDS A LIVE TEAMMATE WHEN YOUR DEAD!!!! If you don't take this advice and end up getting shot a few times don't be a lil bitch and complain about it cause you deserve it especially if you do it during speed ball."

Works starting to suck mainly cause i'm only busing but i'm kinda stuck between being upset and being content cause i'm making decent money off tips too. 
Other then that life's been quite school still sucks and i'm still prob not getting enough sleep.

Ya and elise feel free to try and tackle me anytime, you might actually get one of my legs next time. Didn't do much else, played with some fire and watched elise and amanda play twister since we all know no one really wants to see guys play anyways. The only other thing that happened is me and tim realizing that we had to get off the road in like 5 mins so we both pretty much ran out the door and tim left kenny and chris since they were screwing around. Although they were able to call ken's mom so it's all good. Still think chris shouldn't have asked amanda to homecoming online, i mean come on we were hanging out all night he had plenty of chances, yet he has to do it online. Oh well least he's taking someone, ya it's kinda sad i gotta ask someone yet i have no idea who i'm gonna ask, i got a two weeks still so i'm set. 
Then today i basically spent the day playing paintball and that's all i did. It was actually a good day too. Would have been better if heffernan, sherman, larson, switzer, artune, greg, and elise had actually gone but oh well five out of eleven people who said they'ld go and actually did isn't too bad is it? Actually i can't say that sherman i had only called thur or something and he had band so he couldn't go(ya nick you definitly need to take heffernan's lead and quit band). Well for the people who actually went it was fun. Didn't get any really good bruises, actually i didn't really get any bruises maybe like one. I definitly think i got tim addicted to paintball now too. Even with the two hours we spent cleaning our guns afterwords it was worth it(prob could have gotten it done in an hour max but you know tv is just so distracting and who really wants to work anyways?) I think it all was well worth the soreness that i'm feeling right now. And it was most certainly better then watching hockey, playing hockey or shopping elise."

End of the school year in june i was working out constantly, hardly missed a day, yet never went paintballing and didn't hang out with my friends too much. What four months later? I pretty much end up hanging out with friends at least once a week, work three days a week no matter what, play paintball more, but i have yet to enter the weight room. There has gotta be some compromise i can work out. I need to work out, i've grown weak i don't like how my muscles are pretty much gone, and i don't wanna give up my job or hanging out with my friends. Why did life have to get so difficult? Freshmen and sophomore year it was easy, not to much to worry bout, classes weren't overly hard, and i had free time. Now classes are a bitch, gotta worry bout act's and other crap like that, gotta work three times a week, gotta somehow reclaim all the muscle i built up and build upon it before track, and be able to hang out with friends. And parents say we have it easy. Well hopefully starting tom i'll be able to work out something between school, lifting weights, working, and hanging out with friends. Otherwise i'll prob go insane, or have a mental break down."

They even watched me scrub the rest of the restaurant, watched me clean everything off, saw me start to clean off the section, and they even saw three of us just standing there. Yet these people continued to talk so that we had to sit there waiting for them. then with 20 mins left three more groups came in. We were closing in twenty minutes yet they came in and sat down. All of them could see that everyone in the place was cleaning up so they could leave yet they still came in. Our manager even started to get upset cause if those three people who talked for a straight hour would have left earlier we would have closed at 9:30. Now you know it's bad when the manager who's all about helping the customers starts to get angry at people. Instead they stayed, more people came, and one of the waitresses and i got stuck there waiting for them to leave. So on a day that i should have been one of the first people out, prob getting out at like 9:45, I end up being the last person yet again to leave. Actually I think those people would have stayed another half hour if our manager hadn't gotten upset and shut half the lights off. That's when the people who had been there for a while realized that, oh wow it's almost ten i gotta get home and go to bed. My job isn't really that bad, it's just the people who come in that make it so bad, if there weren't those few people who can't for the life of them tell that when your the last people at a restaurant and you've already been there for a half hour just talkin, that the people who are working might like them to leave so they can get on with their jobs. Ya i know i'm supposed to friendly to customers but seriously if i saw that my friends and i were the last people at a restaurant and they were gonna close i would tend to try and finish up so that other people can get off work since i know i always want too.  Ya there are definitely a few people who i wouldn't mind shooting a few times, even if it was only with my paintball gun or bb gun."

"event","WTF!!!! Okay i knew i was gonna work today. That was just understood so i planed on hanging out afterwords. Prob for only like an hour and a half or so but still i would have been hanging out with my friends. So i show up to work and i get there and start on cones when one of the managers ask me to do bus cause the kid didn't show. That really wasn't bad since i get part of the tips and all so i didn't really care too much. So i do bus for the night, really wasn't too bad just a constant flow of people and not much time to stop but that doesn't bother me too much. It was going pretty good until about 9, which is when we usually start cleaning up, we still had like 8 tables. That really isn't too bad except for the all over the fucking restaurant so i can't start cleaning up. We had 8 tables until about 9:45, then a few left but there were still tables all over so i still couldn't sweep. This is when i really start to get pissed off cause i know that if they don't get up soon i would get stuck there forever. Somehow i get one of the managers to let me start sweeping before the people left but still i didn't help cause there was still people there so i couldn't scrub. I couldn't even start scrubbing until like 9:55. 
You know how bad that is??? We close at 10 and we had still had 3 tables till 5 too. That's when i was when i got slightly upset. So i start scrubbing and all the other fun stuff, then finally at 10:05 the other two tables finally got up, ya i pretty much wanted to kill them, since normally i should have been done about then. I had so much left that it took me a half hour just to clean all of it with some help from one of the managers and prob one of the fastests clean up jobs ever. Now really if this were a weekday or like a sunday that would have been fine. BUT NO it had to to be a sat when i was supposed to go hang out afterwords. So i FINALLY get done at like 10:30 and i start calling my parents, house, cell, beeper and i can't get ahold of them. I was somewhat upset at that point and i just say screw it and call my friends. Just as i thought they didn't think i should come over since it was already 10:40 and they had to leave at 11:30. Ya i really don't blame them since they said the parents were already a lil upset. This is what really pissed me off since i couldn't hang out with my friends and the bon fire that i was thinking bout going to if i couldn't was over before 10. WOW i'm slightly pissed off right now since i got screwed over at work, then screwed over again since i couldn't hang out with any of my friends. 
While this is one of my worst days yet i did actually do something good today. I hung out with kenny, tim, elise, and megan for a few hours at the victorian festival. That actually wasn't too bad, although megan seemed to be drunk cause she just kept wondering around. OH and we kept throwing kenny's popcorn around, although i preferred to eat it. I'm still trying to figure out what the hell was so freaking funny about a dugout. Elise and megan couldn't stop laughing about it for about ten minutes, i don't think they said more then 10 words a piece in that whole time. Even though we really just walked around, and listened to elise and megan talk to all their friends who happened to be there too, it was a good time. Ya and the other thing was that i got a good amount of cash from tips, all singles but hell i could care less."

Really the only big thing that's happened lately is the fact that I got my varsity jacket back with our KVC champs patch. Now I get to deal with my dad trying to force me to put on my medals. Ya that really isn't that big is it? Oh and coleman and putty thought i would be great to chase me down after school and shoot a toy gun at me so they fallowed me to my house then got out and rushed me. It was actually pretty funny cause earlier they had tried to shoot me through the car windows when we were pulled up next to eachother and they just missed.
Oh and one prob very important event that I pretty much completely forgot to put in mon. I got asked to stevenson's homecoming. I have no clue if I'm going in a group, I know no one that goes to stevenson yet I'm still gonna go cause I want to. Now I prob should take coleman's advice and ask her to our homecoming but I just can't get to it yet. Oh I'll definitely ask her but the only question is when. Anyone wanna take bets?"

And yes for all those who think we don't really go there for the wings, I believe that hooter's wings are far better then buffalo wild wings. I think I ate around 15 at least cause they gave us like 10 more then we ordered, yet we ate all of them anyways. But I think the best part was when our waitress couldn't reach the paper towels so I had to help her.
Yes I did do other things today beside going to hooters, I got to work joy. Kinda bad day to work cause it was dead for a while then we had a mad rush where we filled the restaurant for about 2 hours and I ended up a lil behind, but it all ended good. Ya that's bout all i've done this weekend: work, work, work and hooter's since kenny demmed it necessary to piss of his mom so that he couldn't go friday night. The only other new thing is my dad's obsession with me washing my car cause it has a few pieces of dirt on it. He even gave me money to go wash it so I wouldn't have any excuses. I can't understand why he wants the car clean, he isn't the one who is seen driving it and I could care less but he still insisits on it clean."

"event","Yes I know it's been a very long time but with school life has only gotten harder. There's been a lot of crap going on and only a small bit of it good. First I get to deal with school which sucks one hell of a lot since I have trig enriched with mcaleer who believes hw, and lectures are the best way to learn but can't seem to give us both during class and ap bio which just sucks since it's a college lvl class. Work really isn't bad, especially since i started bussing which should suck but I get to talk to more people and I get part of the tips so I actually like it more. I think they started giving me more hours now too which is just fine by me since I want the money.
Oh ya there was labor day which wasn't too bad. Except for the fri before hand cause I was supposed to go hang out with some people till like 9:15 then go upnorth with the obranovic's but instead they ended up waiting till 8:45 to go, so I pretty much got screwed over. Once I got upnorth it wasn't bad though. Got to hang out with obee for a while. Sat I went to mackinac island and walked the 9 miles but even that wasn't bad cause I got some of the best fudge in the world :-) Ya that was pretty much it except for also walking the mackinac bridge, which is about 5 miles, with my grandma. I'm still amazed by that women, she might be old but she can still walk 5 miles faster then most people can. OH YA I almost forgot one of the best parts, we played six-handed euchre for a few hours and taught brent's friend how to play. It's a shame no one will learn how to play it, cause it is far better then regular euchre. 
Aside from that not much else has been going on, just the usual school crap. You know the hw and the lack of sleep. Ya I guess I should prob have studied more for my first ap bio test but I'll see how well I do tom on it. I'll study a lil tonight but there isn't much I can do and I don't think I would do much anways(way to much work)"

Now Trig enriched on the other hand is gonna suck and Mcaleer is gonna make it all the worse. Then came chemistry, not to bad did a lab the first day, should do well and have fun. Finally came 2d-CAD and wow this is by far the best blow off class I've taken to date. We watched slide shows about different intelligences and quotes he liked. Then we watched the last 2 mins of a football game cause it showed what happens when people don't give up. So ya first sem is gonna suck but not having any sports or any pressing need to impress someone is gonna make it bearable even with work.

So ya I got trained in bussing today and it's not too bad. I work pretty much non stop but it's easy and I get to talk to all the people who work there unlike cones where I can only talk to the people who are doing cones with me. Wasn't too bad even though i rarely stop working cause it easy but what really makes it enjoyable is the tips which were about 8 bucks even when I split it with the other guy."

Well at least I spent the day well. Slept in one last time, even if it was only till 10:45. Then after church and a lil while of taking to people I went paintballing. I think 4 and a half hours of paintball is a good ending. Of course I got shot quite a bit. Twice pretty hard when I went to bunker john drew and got two shots off before my gun decided to jam, So I got destroyed. That was pretty much the worst for a while till the last game when my air was out. That just sucked, I prob could have thrown the balls faster. Yet I still decided to run up and take a few shots at sherman while he fixed his gun. Of course they pretty much just rolled out of the barrel, but when nick finished he shot me a few times leaving at least one bruise. Good day though, I practiced with some guys learned some new things and got a little better.  I think I spent my last weekend well between eating at bw's with sherman, neville, and kenny then watching undercover brother at my house, and paintball with sherman and some other people.

Ya so basically I'm pretty much pissed that school is about to start. I know there are upsides to it, such as getting to see people I'd never talk to otherwise and I am able to drive there now, yes I did get a parking spot on north lot like all the other juniors. Ya that can make it somewhat better but it still royally sucks. Yes that's right it royally sucks. I don't think I'll be able to manage the 6:20 wake up for over a week, and the homework is gonna blow. Especially since I have ap bio, pre trig with MCALEER, and chemistry all in the same semester. I've gotten lucky though since I have crockett for ap bio and helmkamp for chem, but still that just sucks. It's even worse now cause I don't know if I can work out after school cause of all the construction, so I'm gonna be screwed when track starts. Plus I'm working now so I don't have much free time after school. Wow this year is gonna suck I'd start a countdown if it wouldn't make the time go slower.

Well now that I've established the extent of my hatred towards hell(aka school) I can at least say the summer wasn't wasted. Or at least these past two weeks haven't been completely wasted. I did get to go bowling with some friends twice, plus just the other day I actually got to play sand volleyball. Yes we did find a place were it is possible to play beach volleyball even if the nets are a little high. It was great, even though I sucked since I haven't played in so long. Now I just need to find some people who are willing to play and find a day I can do it. Along with that I had fun getting eaten alive by a couple of hundred mosquitoes while discovering that a hopeful paintball field is way to close to some houses, got a little to much underbrush, and has almost not usable hiding spots or bunkers. Of course seeing nicks air cannon, nice job by the way nick, and watching black hawk down again after it's been several years since seeing it. That was pretty much it except for staying up till 5 am playing halo. Oh and a few convo's that made me wonder if I lose my sanity at night, prob a good thing though. It seems that my most messed up yet amusing conversations are late at night. Ya that's it but it's not bad since I've pretty much sat on my ass all summer, so I'm at least somewhat happy. Just gotta find someway of topping it all of with my last free night on saturday leave a few suggestions if ya got any, and going up to state prob wont happen brent since I would like to be able to wake up monday."

High Jump, the olympic event I wanted to see the most. Actually really one of the few I actually cared about watching, and I missed it. I know we took second in it but I don't really care about that. I just wanted to watch it and see their form and watch them jump about 3 feet more then what I'm doing. That wouldn't have been that bad if I didn't miss the 100 finals too. So now I'm stuck with only the 200 and the 400 cause everything else is crap and I could careless about them.
Well now that I got that out I can explain why I missed them. It was because I was stuck upnorth just outside of hillman(45 mins south-east of cheybogan) digging two 3 feet deep, 1 foot wide, and 20 feet long trenches for the septic tank that was backing up. Actually it could have been a lot worse since we were digging into sand so it was pretty soft and brian(eldest brother) was there to help. It wasn't that bad since I got to ride the moped around and do some other things. At least my grandfather will be happy to know that it got done and that people are using their cottage besides just them. Although it did kinda piss me off that we drove 4 hours home, a half hour of which was spent in a traffic jam, then when we got home I had to leave right after I finished packing for 4 hours of work."

Ya that's pretty much all that I've been up to lately, except for some more bowling with a kenny and some other kids I've never met before. We were supposed to go laser tag but that just doesn't work well with 6 kids at 9:20 at night, so we just ended up bowling. And once again I sucked but i did improve to a 90 or somewhere near there.

ALright now that I've established that I utterly suck at bowling it wasn't all in vain cause we went and watched eurotrip afterwords which is an extraodinarily funny movie. I'm speechless with how funny that movie was, I just can't think of anything to say about it. I definitely need to buy that movie.

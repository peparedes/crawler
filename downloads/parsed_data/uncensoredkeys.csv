"event","Wow, Day after prom, which was by far the best day of my life. First i went to laurens, took some pics. Next we headed out to the event center to meet up with the limo and the other people who were riding in it. Then we headed down to the university place to take alot more pictures, a total of around 50 i think... wow. After the cheeks cramped up we moved on to dinner at Tsunamis. It was the best meal ive ever had, *maybe it was the company* and plus there was a show, cook on table thing. It was cool. After being filled with food and feeling quite stuffed it was time for prom. The actual prom part of the whole night. Dancing was fun i got to be a little wild... yes i know its hard to imagine, but VERY possible. Ask the people that were around me and you'll find out just how wild ;-). J/K. Only the dancing was wild i promise. After the prom was the most special though. I got home at like 2:30. Well after that vivid discription... *thats sarcasm btw* I think you get the gist of the evening. 


Ok well now im back from Cici's... Andrew you REALLY shouldnt take advantage of stupid girls, especially if there your teacher i mean COME ON!!! lol ;)

Bye
Jason

"event","This is my NEW theme song... dun dun dun....



I never walk when I can run
I don't believe I ever could
People try to slow me down
Sayin', ""Boy you really should
kick back and chill""
But I can't stand still
I called the doctor, he said, ""Son,
I cannot offer you a pill""
So I never found relief
And now I've got to move until 
I've had my fill
I can't stand still
Back where I come from
Life's never humdrum
I wish I could take you there
Oh, we had the world at our feet
Life was sweet
Ain't no doubt
Grab a seat 
Check it out
Oh, I thought it never would end
But I lost it somehow
Would you look at me now?
I'm tryin' hard to tone it down
Gotta watch my P's and Q's
Maybe look before I leap
And then I think, ""Hey, what's the use?""
Ain't done it yet
And I can't forget how it feels when you dance 'til you drop
So don't even start to suggest that I stop
I never will
I can't...
No no no no
No no no no...
I can't stand still



I swear im living my life to the fullest,  inspired by my friends from foottight... YES i know i said tight... dont ask


Today was tiring, 4 hours of rehersal, followed by an hour of hanging with the bestest ladies eva, Lauren and Julie... u guys make me laugh till my tummy hurts... seriously, lets shag... haha The shag lessons at carolina mall... ahhh such good good good good... ahem great times.

THEN after that i bought a shirt and a jacket with the help of my lovely assistant lauren... thanks btw.

AND after i was almost in a car wreck after getting gas, i went to sports center to meet up with ashlyn *the dance instructor* and julie *dance partner* to learn some new stuff for a dance ""solo"" .... julie u made my arms real sore.. honest lol

Tomorrow ive got more rehersal so dont blame me if im not home to entertain you all... like always...

AND THEN ... after all the crazy dance stuff, I had a CONCERT with community band. we did really good thanks for all the people who came out to support us. 

Well now that the day is almost over i believe i must say one thing to a special friend....

TAYLOR YOUR GONNA GET INTO NCSSM SO DONT FRET CUZ UR MY BEST BET ON MAKIN THE CUT...:-D

Well now that thats over with... i am going to retire to talkin to lauren on the internet till i get to sleepy to type... Goodnight everone"

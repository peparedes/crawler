i didnt really hang out with anyone except bobby and i hung out with Joe Mariucci and we went and saw a movie it was pretty fun.. i enjoy hanging out with him. He is a good guy.

I am starting to wonder if i really have any true friends at all... i think the only one i have is elyse... it seems like if i had any other ones i would get calls to hang out all the time or even just a call to say hello but i dont.  Its really starting to bug me that no one wants to hang out with me.. i feel like i have to invite myself everywhere and thats not the person i am at all.  

well i am in a weird mood. but i do feel very loved because of my baby."

life is going okay for me 
i still cant grasp the fact that i wont see her again...

my grandma tells me i shouldnt dwell on it but its my way of coping with it... she never lost a friend when she was young but you would think she would understand seeing she has lost 3 kids 2 husbands and 2 sisters... but she doesnt.  i feel like i am not allowed to remember her. my grandma makes me feel like i should have forgot about her a long time ago but i cant and i dont ever want to.. my grandma is a pro at guilt trips and it almost makes me feel guilty for remembering her... i told my grandma though that i wont ever forget lindsay because she inspired me to be caring to all my friends and respect them because i dont know when i wont see them again... 

hmm.. things are crazy lately... john mayor is always on the radio and Nelly, though that song isnt about her, still reminds me of her and is ALWAYS on.. little signs prove to me that she is still around us. like street lights going on and off when i am under them and when i say lindsay give me a sign your here by making a song a fave. song of mine come on the radio and not even 2 minutes later the song is on.. and my radio turning its self on almost always on a song that reminds me of her i miss her more than words can say and i cant imagine how her family feels espically around holidays.  well this has been long enough...and though she is gone her memory still lives on through her friends and family and espically her little brother who looks just like her."

"event","ive been thinking a lot lately and there is so much regret that i feel...

its not that i'm thinking about YOU its that i'm thinking about what we did and how stupid i was for doing that... why would i even think about throwing all of what me and bobby had away for some stupid little fling that should have never happened.  I think about things that used to remind me of you they still do but whne i think about you i only think bad things.  Like for example.. quiet things reminds me of you but at the same time it doesnt... like i dont sit there and think about you the whole time the song is on you name just pops into my head and leaves that very second.  then i think about how much of a bad person i was.
i realize now that whenever i think about you i get this hate inside me.  So i guess thank you for helping me realize all the mistakes that you caused me to do.i totally regret everything with you!

on another note..
ive been thinking about this friendship that i had with someone that isnt really there anymore.  i mean yeah we talk at dance and stuff but we dont hang out anymore and we dont tell secrets anymore. Its like the friendship was lost or something? 

sara i miss you i want to be best friends again"

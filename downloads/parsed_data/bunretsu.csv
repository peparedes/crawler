As you've no doubt noticed, this journal is pretty dead.

My interest in Takarazuka is null and has been for a long time, though I still value the good times I had in the fandom and am happy to see that the fandom isn't going to die out any time soon. ;)

As for Metro, I can't commit to reporting regularly about the activities of the Metro ladies anymore, either. Moreover, as you probably know, Deguchi Yumiko has now left Metro--after a year of agonizing over the decision--to get married and start a new life. Despite this heartbreaking decision, Sararan is continuing Metro as her own unit now alongside her other jobs (appearing in TV shows and the like).

As a result of Deguchi's departure, the Sararan fan club that was a remnant of Sararan's Takarazuka fan clubs will merge with the Metro fan club/mailing list. This means the new Metro + Sararan fan club membership will not cost you a thing, and anyone can sign up to support Sararan individually as well as her Metro projects. I expect we will continue to see many wonderful things from her in the future! &hearts;

But, on that note, I am closing this journal. Thanks to the free trial of paid account status, I have already locked down all public posts to friends-only posts. In a week I will probably make the entire journal private <strike>or simply delete it</strike>. 

<b>EDIT:</b> Due to popular demand (?) I will NOT delete the journal. Entries will, however, be f-locked. Please poke me if I haven't friended you and you would like to still read the ""archives."" Thanks!

Anyway, thanks for reading! And if you are so inclined, feel free to come visit my regular journal, <lj user=""screamflydream"">. ^^

<strong>Best wishes,</strong>

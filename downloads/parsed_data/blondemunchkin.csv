"event","im bored!! just got home, went to see fone booth. the film that is, not an actual fone booth. even im not that sad, altho i saw a few on the way! lol. was meant to see bulletproof monk but we missed it cos amy and claire were late. its cool tho, fone booth is well good. not what i expected at all but it messed with my brain a bit and i wierdly like films that do that. id recomend seeing it!

anyway, amys in paris (got a txt today, look at her being able to txt from abroad!!) and dads staying at his brothers so its just me and mum. weve bonded a lot which is nice, i dont rele feel like i can talk to her usually but its cool at the moment. and shes letting me do stuff i usually cant like go online a lot and use the fone whenever and stuff.

but alas no one is bloody online!! selfish gimps all of you! well, this annoying girl liz from my skool is and this scary guy called sean and dan, but hes away. so i am spending my time boring u all instead.

i had a chat with will yesterday which was rele nice, havent spoken to him in a while. i was having a low self esteem moment and he just rele cheered me up as usual. he just said some rele nice things *smiles* its nice to know someone cares i guess. thanks will!

and seeing nathan the other day helped me realise a few things, which is cool. i wont bore u all with the details but i was chatting to will (altho he did disagree with most of my arguments!) and it all just made me, i dunno...not *realise* rele but more confirm that i dont like him *in that way* anymore. its cool tho, were friends which is nice.

so stuffs going well rele. god, i cant believe ive only just fully realised that im *over* nathan! its ridiculous!! oh well, im just over emotional and romantic and crap. thanks again to will, u probably didnt mean it and i no im making a big deal but that was like one of the nicest things anyones ever said to me! *smiles*

so yeah, im kinda at peace with myself for once. shocking i no! its nice catching up with people i guess. like i had a huge chat with nathan, who i can just talk about anything with and one with will who just makes me smile when im down and who i love to pieces! plus me and claire had such a laugh today. its all good!

this is a kinda long rant! bbye..."

Hell yeah!! those quizes(?)are accurate!!! how do u spell the plural of quiz?

i had such a cool day!! yayness!! stayed at laras howse and nathan was out which was really cool cos didnt wanna see him. he is going out with nina but im cool with it i guess. ill probably realise that im not in a few days, but im pretty sure im over him now. much thanks to my dearest dans horny mormon comments i think! i really wanna say thanx 2 everyone cos i no ive been a pain recently and so thanks for putting up with me and listening to me cry or wotever! and im not saying that i dont appreciate u all but i think dan does deserve a special mention.

anyway...then got up at 5 45 after going to bed at like 3 and got a bus with tricia. all good!! then i asked the guy at orpington station which train went to kent house and he said the 7 47 on plat 1 so i go there and get on the train just before it pulls out. THEN it pulls out and says that it goes to shortlands then fast to catford...panick!!

so i get off at shortlands with the intention of getting a 227 to skool and who do i see at the station? one of my favouritest people in the world...DAN!! he greets me with 'wot r u doing here, u dont live here!!' and i chatter to him and explain myself.

then i scared amy, will etc on the train by grinning as i walked past!! plus confused them i think! hehe!! and my bus came straight away and i saw my friend paul. i was in SUCH a good mood at skool!! it was just really cool cos i saw lots of people and generally had yayness!!

so, yeah im happy at the moment. plus, im a pink lady!! hehe. much love to all..."

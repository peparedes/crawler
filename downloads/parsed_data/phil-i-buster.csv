"event","So it is 100th Night - 100 nights until the Firsties graduate and head off into the future.  The last time I celebrated 100th night I had the 100 nights left.  And now, a mere eight years later life is at another impending crossroad.  Being accepted into the Foreign Area Officer program has so many amazing possibilities attached to it that I can't help but truly look into staying in the service a bit longer, learning Russian and living in some amazing places doing amazing things.  But now, unlike the 100th night of my college years I know that opening doors closes others.  It is so easy in youth to keep door stops in place and think about getting back to the original plan after a detour or two.  But as the months slip into years I can see that doorstops wear thin and doors close without your knowing.  I would much rather be in charge of my destiny than let life happen to me.  And thus the dilemma - taking this program knowing it may close other doors or staying focused on my goals for the future, chasing Gatsby's green light.  I suppose it is the ""live in the now"" or ""plan for the future"" debate painted a different color.  If I look at history my future will always win out over my now - the possible over the real.  Of course, this all wreaks of the error of the excluded middle - now and then are not mutually exclusive.  Living in the now does not exclude the planning for what tomorrow will bring.  I guess the trick is to find out if and how today can build into tomorrow.  Can being a FAO work into my ultimate goals?  That is the question.  It is never the answers that are truly difficult, it is in finding the right questions.  
  The search rages on.  ""Meanwhile, according to custom, let us go and enjoy an hour of refreshment in the gondola that awaits us.""

We'll cast one glance
At these old grey walls;
We'll bid a fond adieu.
So join and sing off
One Hundred Days 'Til June."

"event","Hell it has been a long time since I posted anything - quick recap of the last few months, I'll start somewhere around November.
Thanksgiving - awesome trip to visit the family
Army/navy bonfire - I planned one hell of an event complete with a 4000 person cordon, a burning 32 foot boat and fireworks.
Army/Navy game - *ouch*, maybe Next year
NYC/Dave Matthews concert - a great trip, good music and the best company I could ask for
Christmas - back to NH with my family, crazy, all over the place - totally wicked awesome
New Years - low key
Annie moved to Central Apartments - it was dark for most of the move so I felt like one of a band of bandits slowly emptying her apartment of all its possessions.  Her place isn't quite set up but is is cool being neighbors - if we go through the basement we don't even have to exit the building to get to each other's apartments.  That's good because we sometimes are laaaaazzzzyyyy.  That makes me even more envious of her commute to work.  I thought my 3 minute walk was a nice commute - she has to walk half that - Lucky.
Super Bowl Party - impromptu party - went well.
Two Formals - we are becoming quite the socialites
Ongoing PhD classes - after what can only be called a slow start it is picking up.  My media Psych and Research Methods and Design classes are rapidly coming to an end.  My Social basis of behavior and Developmental Psych classes are just starting and my Media ethics Prof. has gone MIA on me.  Still, i am loving what I'm learning and starting to formulate Dissertation ideas in the murky depths of my cortex.
  overall life is good and I continue to grow (metaphorically, not literally, I'm already tall enough)."

"event","some days are good ones for no apparent reason.  nothing extraordinary occurs within the confines of it's solar cycle.  nothing tangible was gained by my existence from 12:00.01AM onward.  I really can't point to anything tangible that I created over the past 18 hours and 59 minutes.  still, today was a good day.  could the feelings come form the intangibles.  could the happiness be a byproduct of the fact that days to not exist in vacuums.  we are not left to float freely in the seas of existence.  our lives, our series of now moments are anchored to the past ones.  so as this moment's now becomes that moment's i smirk at nothing tangible but my inner sense of smiling out loud.  there's some polesemy for you."

"event","red and black antennea waving. they all do it the same. we all do it the same way.
   I grow weary of the apple eaters.  I tire of hearing of simplicity and fairness.  I long to hear of Honesty and Justice with a capital J.  Perhaps it is all perspective, perhaps my work environment seems so much worse when placed against a great weekend.  Perhaps I am just too tired.  Perhaps it is all something that a beer, a good CD and a deep breath will make less irritating. Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps."

"event","would be an awsome name for a hard rock band.  I've always thought that.
Playing along with Ann's family game, I will now list my top ten albums of the moment.

1) Bright Eyes - I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning
2) Coldplay - X&Y
3) Dave Matthews Band - LiveTrax vol 3.
4) Flogging Molly - Within a Mile of Home
5) Belle and Sebastian - If You're Feeling Sinister
6) Dave Matthews Band - Stand Up
7) Jack Johnson - In Between Dreams
8) Green Day - American Idiot
9) Various Bands - Garden State Soundtrack
10) Dave Matthews Band - Live in Chicago

Honorable Mention: - Moby - Hotel
                   - Great Big Sea - Something Beautiful.

So, what ahve we learned here today? We learned that I like DMB a lot.  We learned that I need to up my B&S volume before their NYC Concert.  We learned that what we call reality is merely our internal reflection of the shadows that make up this world.  To be fair that last part wasn't learned in this posting but elsewhere in my reading of J.D. Salinger and the ensuing analysis, synthesis and discussion.  Oh, and we learned that diseases make good heavy metal band names."

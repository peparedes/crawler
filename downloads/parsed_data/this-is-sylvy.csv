"event","&nbsp;2 months, exactly, left to go. 

I cannot wait, I cannot wait. 

I need a change of scene, badly. Of course I'll miss some things, but these are very few and can be visited whenever I pay 50 dollars to the bus driver outside the marketplace any Friday afternoon.&nbsp; 

But overall, I'm sick of it.&nbsp;

Today was the day that topped it all off. I'm genuinely hurt, genuinely pissed. I thought you knew me. Guess I was wrong.

People down here are too aggresive, too mean...it's not only when they're driving that they act rude.""Friends"" aren't being too&nbsp;friendly and I'm just sick of it. I feel underappreciated. If there's anything I can honestly be proud of, anything I can say I'm amazingly good at, anything I can be crazy-conceited about, it's how good of a friend I am. Not like some people who promise it and don't deliver (and I'm sure you know who you are). I can be hundreds of miles away, working two jobs, drowning under a stack of homework, having millions of problems, whatever, and I am THERE for people. I'm supportive. I ask people how things are going. I call. I message. I comment. I worry. I pick up my phone. I don't make fun of people. I feel bad if I have to log off or leave the phone cause my mother needs it or something. I make myself available. I don't backstab. I say whatever is on my mind. I love it when people say whatever is on&nbsp;theirs.&nbsp;But somehow, this isn't enough. 

Which is why this time I'm sure it's going to be different when I go up there. Everyone has had time to show their true colors, and very few have shown up with a shade somehow&nbsp;worth keeping. 

I will no longer assume people care, because honestly, how many of you do? Like I said, not many of you. I'm going to be self-centered now.

Acquiantances? The more the merrier. True friends? It'll take a while for me to call someone that again.

I'm going to be picky now. Very picky, about who DESERVES the honor of being my friend. I'm going to put people to the test. I'm going to trust less. 

Unfortunately, you don't always get what you put into things, so I'm going to be more careful now. 

I wont miss anyone except my mom, my family, and my turtle. 

Tough luck if you wanted to keep up the appearance of being interested. It isn't going to work anymore."

"event","<p>....I'm listening to the Libertines and Kings of Leon and Hot Hot Heat and Razorlight again. 10th grade music.<br /><br />This could only happen for two reasons.<br />One, it's summertime, and for some reason I can't bring myself to listen to it unless it's summer time.<br />Two (and most importantly), J.O.E has reappeared&nbsp;(every letter means something except the ""e"", which was added for good measure back in the day).<br /><br />I'm feeling particularly lucky because, if any of you recall my blog entry at the beginning of my summer vacation about the things I definitely had to do this summer, seeing him/hanging out with him&nbsp;again was one of them.<br />We'd been planning to since first semester freshman year at UCF, but I was there, and he was down here, and then we lost touch.<br /><br />Lucky for me, Jade randomly happened to bump into him the other night,&nbsp;thus re-establishing that ""connection"". Thankyouthankyouthankyou, Jade. You are awesome, and you are absolutely making my entire summer thanks to the fact you were hanging out where you were that night.<br /><br />May the fun begin :)</p>"

"event","<p><br />So I read something (like I always do,lol) and it made me think (as it always does).</p><p>This is what I read:</p><p>""Imagine settling for a life you can have because you don't have the courage to go after the life you really want.&nbsp; You have to make a decision- the kind that bends your future in a whole new direction.""<br /><br />My immediate, inner-monologue response to this: ""F*^$!""</p><p>Why? Because of what I've been saying all these months: I might change one of my majors to something else."" I've been saying: ""I don't think I'll study film after all"".And the people who know me, or kind of know me and have even the slightest idea about how passionate I was about it and how much of a respect I have for it would ask: ""Why?"" To these people I'd say: ""Because everyone is so negative. Because they squash your hopes, and why should I put up with four years of studying if I'll supposedly never do anything valuable, if nobody will?"" And yeah, it's true I hate that about every experience I've had with ""industry professionals"" thus far (examples: Miami Film Festival workshops about how to enter the entertainment industry, my Spring semester World Cinema class). But there's more to it than that, and I'll get to it after the next paragraph.</p><p>The one person who knows me better than anyone (aka my mother) would say: ""And I know why: it's because you're lazy. A ti te gusta lo facil. You don't want to make an effort."". And I would tell her: ""No, it's cause blahblah[insertlameexcusehere]."" And eventually the conversation would stop.</p><p>But this quote made me realize a few things, which I could collectively refer to as the truth:</p><p>1. Yeah, people are negative. I get the impression those already making films don't want their field getting any more crowded than it already is, because that threatens their continued sucess. Hence, they are bastards and they try to bring budding filmmakers down. BUT...people will always be after their own agenda. People will always be scared of a threat to their ""survival"", so to speak. This happens everywhere. If you base yourself on everything everyone tells you you cannot do, well, you might as well make yourself a box and hide in it for the rest of your life. You can't let opinions/negative predictions shake you. That's the first way I was putting up a weak argument.<br /><br />2. I am a hardheaded person. Always have been. I have never cared about what people say I can't do, the moment this is done to me, I go right ahead and do it, sometimes simply to prove those people wrong. That makes my first excuse even more impossible in the context of who I am. Mrs. Byrd is saying that it's a tough time and that it is extremely difficult for anyone to make it in film? Well, Mrs. Byrd can say whatever she feels like saying....that shouldn't be a reason for me not to go after what I'd like to go after.<br /><br />3. My mother is right. Besides being hardheaded, I can be lazy. I'm a capable person, and you'll never hear me refer to Advertising/Public Relations as anything other than ""common sense"". I know I'll be good at it, cause all you do is talk, get the word out, fly around a lot, and write press releases and such. That, to me, is easy. It would be easy, it would be easy money, I wouldn't mind doing it. But film...like I said before, film isn't as easy. Even as a choice of study it's going to be tough, and Weitz let me on on that last semester...she was super picky, I had never felt a professor be so strict on me. I don't know what grade I have in that yet, but I'm scared it'll be a B. I tried, but it was more challenging than you'd imagine. I've never cared about reputation or class rank or anything, but it's hard to have worked so hard to this point to have a 4.0, get A's in all your classes, and then do ""Good"" instead of ""Excellent"" on the one that covers a topic you actually like.&nbsp;Then after graduation...not only is it hard to get into, as Mrs. Byrd so bluntly pointed out...it's a hard lifestyle (even more so than Ad/PR, which requires travel but not for such extended periods of tie). It means rejection. It means having others be hard on you, and being hard on yourself. It means really long hours, and revisions, and planning, and pressure from several areas at a time. It means high expectations from others who've funded you. And, me being me, it means hard expectations on myself, feeling like I've really delivered what I've promised, which I always make a big deal out of. Feeling like I've made something up to standard. And what is standard, you ask? Standard is the feeling I get when I see a really amazing movie: something well-shot, something clever, something moving, something that makes people happy that they've spent 2 hours of their life paying attention to a story someone felt had to be told. Like I mentioned before...I have such a respect for film. I don't know if maybe it's the fact that I've come from such a minimal background: my mom hates movies. Twas only recently that I started being a little more social and going out to see movies in theatres with friends, but overall&nbsp;I've seen relatively few in my life.&nbsp; Not only that, but I've never owned a camera. My mom sucks at filming, so she never saw a need for it, and they're kind of expensive, so I've never been able to ask for one. Maybe it's that (not to mention that I fear this'll make me look kind of stupid in a production class where everyone already arrives knowing so many things I'm not even familiar with). Anyways...ask any of my friends when we walk out of a film festival screening, a movie at AMC, or from their living room after having watched a really good one at their house. I am awestruck. I cannot stop going on and on about it. I go home, and I do casual research about it, even. I want to know everything about how they brought so many things together so well to come up with such an incredible end product.</p><p>And here is where I think the problem comes from: I respect it so much, I like it so much, I think it should be so well done, that in spite of my love for it and despite the fact that I could see myself doing it, I get scared. I get really scared of not doing things as well as the filmmakers I've seen do. And I pressed on and said I would do it anyways until a few weeks ago, when I grew tired and said ""I give up,I'll do this as a hobby only"". And this is a problem I shouldn't of had such a difficult time recognizing in me, because thinking back, I do it all the time, I scare myself out of working for what I want. One example in particular comes to mind now: me and my acting aspirations. As soon as I found out that I unfortunately did not and never would have a singing voice, I knew I wanted to act. I was always with a pen in my hand, writing, but more than that I wanted to be an actress. Those of you who were around a few years ago will nod at this part of the story. Sixth grade: out of my own initiative, I manage to get an 8 week drama camp scholarship that my mother had told me she absolutely could not afford to pay for on her own. 9th grade: I take Drama I, Ms. Barrow (the teacher) tells me I'm great at it and invites me to take Drama 4 Honors the very next year. What do I do? I agree. Then I freak out about my ability to be so good, despite the fact I'm being told so by someone who should know. The day before the deadline to drop classes at Coral Gables Senior High, I am at my counselors office, changing it to some elective so mediocre that by now I can't even remember what it the hell was...and I'm telling myself, ""this is what I want"". I am lying to myself. My sixth-grade self would have been ecstatic that somebody was complimenting her acting, she would have read books about it all summer and shown up in 10th grade ready to be the best actress in that class, she would have been seeing her name in lights already. I don't know what happened between 6th and 9th, but I lost my nerve. Acting scared me. I loved it, I adored it, I wanted to do it so badly, and I knew once I got on stage I'd do fine and I wouldnt forget my lines or anything, but the moment before I got on, I would feel like my heart was about to stop. My hands would get sweaty. My stomach would hurt. I'd play my part, get off the stage, and classmates would tell me that I looked so natural up there (I guess I was good at it after all), but in reality I was mortified, and when I was in the counselors office that day signing off what could have put me closer to achieving my dream, I was remembering that feeling, and I chickened out. To this day&nbsp;I have not been up on a stage again. Some of my friends (like Mario and Jade) continued with drama, and would tell me stories about it, and I felt like crap. I hardly ever let on; I made excuses about why I decided it wasnt the thing for me after all. I took on Journalism and forgot about&nbsp;acting, and when Journalism sucked I moved on to language and business classes.&nbsp;And I still go to plays sometimes and I get the slightest feeling that maybe I took the wrong turn, but it's not terrible, and with something like acting you never know...but with film...I read that quote and I knew I couldn't make the same mistake. I couldn't scare myself out of it. I can't do it. My creativity, I will admit, is big but it's also ""shy"". I can have a million ideas, but out of those, I'll probably express only one and act on half of it before I get too self-critical and say ""nah."" But it's there, and I know it will not stop nagging me until I pay attention to it.</p><p><br />I know that years down the line, if I settle for the life I can have-a publicist living in the city she loves and grew up in (Miami) catering to the needs of a band or an artist that went after a life&nbsp;THEY/HE/SHE really wanted, I will feel awful. I will be doing just fine...I'll have the multiple-child family I've always wanted (which would be harder to have as a filmmaker), but I will always ""what-if"", and it will drive me, literally, insane. I will always have ideas, and I will feel terrible about not being able to act on them. And this creativity will not leave me alone, just like when I leave off from writing ideas will come to me and I'm not able to rest in peace till I write that poem/story/blog entry&nbsp;down...</p><p>So I've given up in a different way...I've given up in favor of doing things the hard way, in favor of facing my fears and recognizing my abilities. Like&nbsp;Marianne Williamson said:<br /><br />""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.""<br /><br />&nbsp;I AM going to do film. I'm going to make a decision that bends my future in a whole new direction...I'm fully capable of doing practical things in life. If I wanted to, I could be a lawyer, an engineer, or a doctor. But I've let off from pretending that doing one of these things can possibly make me completely happy. It wont, I was born to do what I'm best at doing yet kind of intimidated by-the arts. Acting. Writing. Drawing. And film....especially film :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

"event","When i can't afford it the most...i'm bordering on lazy.  My motivation is gone to do anything that i don't like...like knitting, sweaters, art history,concept art, errr...and most likely any other class except for lingerie.  I even skipped sweater class yesterday and did nothing last night...given that it was 10:30 pm when i got home.  But i lounged around for hours after that playing computer games.  I'm such a fucking loser.  I talked to my mom and got thanksgiving plans settled at least.  I'm going to matt's which is fine and dandy with me.  Actual good food and actual good company instead of the crackhouse she's going to.  She also decided to tell me that her car got stolen..out of her gated community...with pretty much no chance of getting it back.  Niiiice.  So i guess i should start doing work...it's not like i woke up at 8am to write a live journal entry.  Everything sucks."

"event","I'm bored and in anti-work mode, so why not take the time to write about all the stupid shit that i call my life.  I skipped out of stupid knitting class early to put in the eyelets on my bustier.  Shit's hot.  Too bad the rock solid boobs on the dress form didn't fill the cups right and when i tried to lace it up better, one of the seams busted open.  Oops, fuck me.  It looks like fucking Barbie underwear.  Too flowery and too much pink for my style, i even put a dumb feather boa on it because it was at that point of ridiculousness anyway, so at least it was funny.  Looked good next to everybody else's black/white/brown boring ass projects.  So i tried it on afterwards OVER my shirt cuz im not a skank like the stupid bitches in my class that parade around in their see through crap with totties hanging out.  Sorry, rant.  It made me feel pretty...and skinny.  It was funny that when i took it off, i felt really fat in comparison.  Blah.  These other girls wanted to try mine on...i was like...""fucking no....whore"" Then i posed my Predator inspired underwear concept to my teacher and she was all like ""hahaha, underwear? you mean costume"" and i was like ""yahhhh...but it's scandalous so its costume underwear"".  But woohoo i can do it.  Now all i need is armor and weapons.  Mwa hahahaha.

"event","One teacher said Butthole by accident instead of buttON hole today.  Apparently i was only one of two people that caught that.  Made me giggle.  I just got back from school..actually took a subway, but i'm pretty soaked anyway because i ended up having to take a long way home.  Why, you ask?  Well, i've said it before and i'll say it again...the only thing worse then having a stranger (usually men) talk to you is KNOWING that they are going to talk to you.  This suit and tie guy sitting across from me on the subway kept giving me the ""i'm gonna talk to you"" look and i was doing my best to look a mixture of unsociable, pissed off, and in a hurry.  So then i had to get off at my stop, which was unfortunately his too (mother fucker) and i ""dashed"" up the stairs as quickly as i could manage without knocking TOO many little old ladies over.  But then the stupid light at 8th and broadway had just turned green, so i had to wait FOREVER to walk across...meanwhile he managed to get up right next to me with his dumb umbrella.  So the light turned and i walked as fast as humanly possible towards my apartment, but he caught up to me and asked me to share his umbrella.  I'm like ""uh..no thanks, i don't mind the rain"" ::start walking faster:: ::he walks faster keeping the umbrella over me:: he says ""yah, you have a tough face, you seem tough"" (haha, what the fuck) Then he says he liked my hair and asked if i do it myself...i say ""no, my BOYFRIEND does it for me"" he keeps walking with me past that point, but im not talking and to cross the street, you had to go around this huge puddle...so he went one way and i pretty much went the other way and didn't look back.  I'm not a bad person? i just think talking to strangers is creepy.  I don't care to know their intentions, i guess unless they are important people in the fashion or movie industries.  Oh god, why did i just tell this story? Oh yah, i know.  Am i not intimidating...at ALL! LEAVE ME ALONE!"

"event","Halloween rocked! sorta... Matt and I exchanged gifts on thursday because i skipped class on friday to go to PA and i got him the 18"" huge figure of Hellboy, which he expected so poo.  Then he shows me ONE of his gifts and its this really fucking awesome framed comic strip that he drew of him and me, all evil and such and i love it. THEN he shows me that he got tiny little pumpkins for us to carve because i had been wanting to carve one since the end of september.  So we carved them with exacto knives and mine was ok, but of course matt's was the best thing ever and we took evil pictures with them that makes us look like we have super powers. And THEN he hands me this package and wa la, he got me a fucking IPOD. Who does that?  He swears it wasn't supposed to be a Halloween gift and i was supposed to get it months ago...but seriously...whoa.  I was like ""ha, thanks for making my gift look like complete garbage :( 
 So,  we went to LI to trick or treat for halloween, so we left saturday afternoon and were gonna sleep over matt's house....in matt's old room that is now furnished as a ""Moose lodge"" and is really quite odd.  But anyway, on the way there, this jackass old asian women hits us from behind right on the ramp to the BQE (not the best spot) in almost stand still traffic.  She tells us in broken english that she wasn't paying attention at all and that her head was down by the stereo rummaging through her purse.   Good job, jackass.  So it was dark and rainy and it looks like matt's car ony got a few light scratches...because she hit us going about...3mph! So she offered him $100 to forget about it, which he is siked about the rest of the way home.  A few hours later then planned, Brendan shows up with his ""electric log"" costume that was very sub-par compared to our Robo-Ren and Cyborg Stimpy costumes that we spent a LOT of time on, but it was actually funnier that it was so crappy.  So he shows up around 12:30am and we giggle together because we all look ridiculous and can't see very well, and then i figured we would just hang out for a little bit or just go to bed because tommorrow was the big day.  But instead, I was dragged along to this girl's house that i've never met that's younger then me and just had a baby and all these other people that i could tell sucked right away.  We stayed there for almost 2 hours doing nothing because they were watching some dumb movie and i was ready to punch someone.  So we get home around 3:30am and went to bed in ""The Moose Lodge"".  I've never seen so many moose things in my life.  Even though we can a late night, we ""had"" to get up at 9am...blah.  Well, when matt looked at his car in the morning he notices a shit load wrong with the bumper and back and is gonna try to talk to the lady for more money because $100 definately won't cover it.  So we went trick or treating and it was very upsetting how many kids weren't out.  We had more young kids give us the candy then we saw actually trick or treating.  It was pretty ridiculous though...we went around one block and went back home because our bags were full and it was damn hot out.  Since nobody was trick or treating, and because our costumes were so great, people gave us handfulls of candy instead of the stadard ""take one""  Booyah! I actually ended up with twice the amount of candy because matt doesn't like it too much so he gave me all of his. :) So then we hung out and packed up to go to the parade in NYC.  On the car ride, i got a call from my Dad saying my grandmom died and i don't really know how to feel about that because i only met her a few times, but i guess i'm sad.  My Dad is saying thats reason why we should start talking again.  Bah.  I also got a call from this random girl that saw my Dinosaur Pajama's in this Intimate Apparel Show that was yesterday and wants to buy them...like...right now.  Ha, i don't know what to do...how much?  Does she have to know that i dyed the fabric with hair dye and bleach and it kinda smells, as well as sometimes comes off on your skin?  Ack, i don't know what to do, i have to call her back today or tommorrow.  It's awesome that people liked them though.  Go me.  

So we get to Brookly and take the subway.  Jesus Christ stairs were not fun.  When we got to the parade...we were in the way far back and stood there FOREVER doing nothing...well, we posed for a LOT of pictures.  Everybody liked Ren more then Stimpy :( Then again, I wasn't wearing a gold spandex bodysuit with a huge package.   It's funny to think that sooo many people have pictures of the three of us from all our shananagans, not just on Halloween, but all the costumes.  So yah, the parade was fun, but soo tiring.  Sure don't wanna go to school today...and i already ate too much candy this morning ::barf::"

"event","How come everyone I meet seems to be twice as inconsiderate as the last person?  I don't feel like i am an inconsiderate person.  As i sit here trying to do homework, listening to the floor-shaking, head pounding bass coming from next door, with a roommate and her boyfriend that i just want to smack for being so stupid, i just want to ask why!? Sometimes i wish for ignorance and that nothing would bother me as much as it does, but i simply can't ignore my anger, frustration, and apathy towards almost everyone.  I hate people.  Here's a good example.  When i sit on the train, i listen to my music loud enough to my liking, but not loud enough to make the entire car listen to it with me.  And when someone sits next to me, i'm more then cautious to stay on my specified half of the seat, unlike the usually smelly man that sits next to me thats hitting my arm every second and freaking me the fuck out. Ok, maybe it's not the best example.  I don't know. I just feel like my world is never EVER to my fitting.  I can't have silence when i want, I can't turn the light off and sleep when i want, i can't punch tara's boyfriend in the face when i want.  I'm so full of hate, but i really don't see there being any other way to be.  There's so many horrible people out there that do such awful things, usually to me.  Anyone i've ever known does nothing but disappoint.  So many disappointments...and so many yet to come..."

Apparently i'm scary, but if i'm scary, why would you like me in the first place? Dammit.  I made it perfectly clear that i liked him...i called him, always asked to hang out, invited him to any get-togethers, tried to go to lunch at the same place everyday, played tackle football.  I  believe i might have even gone so far as to smack his ass a few times.  Cmoooon. So naturally after about a year i guess of persuing, i gave up because it was just ridiculous. I think we might have hung out twice and with someone else there, and he came to my ""pool party"" that ended up being 4 people including me. So ANYWAY, he somehow found me on myspace a little while ago and started talking to me again and somehow this conversation came up. My self esteem was so messed up in middle school and highschool because of things like this and i guess its nice to learn that you weren't as horrible as you thought, but its still not fair! My life could have been considerably different (and better) if people that wanted to be my friend actually were. Arggg, stupid boys..."

Too many.  I have no idea what i would do, but i have no idea what i'm going to do right now without him.  It's funny because the top reason i'm not isn't my education for some reason, it's that i just got this apartment with Tara and it would be unthinkable to bail on her.  It would be a ridiculous thing to do...it would jeopardize everything i have worked so hard for...i can't do it...but i want to so bad.  I get to see him friday night-sunday night every week.  Apparently that's not so bad, but i refuse to believe it.  We've been literally inseparable from the day we met.  It's not fair, we should be allowed to stay together. He keeps calling it a temporary situation because he's wants to design something really good for K'nex and then find a better job in NYC.  But he bought a car, a 1-year leased apartment, a pennsylvania driver's lisence.  And he says if he's lucky, he could get another job after 1 year.  Fucking changes.  Changes suck unless they are voluntary.  My internship is fun.  People are nice and such, and i pretty much know what i'm doing most of the time.  I need that $1500 NOW though, not in 6 weeks.  I need another job pronto.  Today is the 1st day i was actively searching for one though.  How much does that hour long Blockbuster application suck?  That stupid phone keypad that's small as fuck and all the dumb, vague questions they ask.  Hopefully i didn't fail that part again....hehe.  I applied like...8 more places too.  Yee haw.  Ricki's wants to give me a job, but i don't think they can work around my stupid little schedule.  Thats another thing.  I waited so damn long after school ended to find a job so that i could spend as much time with matt as possible before he left...and now i'm suppose to be free every week from friday night-sunday night.  And my internship is tuesday and wednesday from 9-5, so when the f am i suppose to get a job for? Mother Fuck.  Someone give me a night job for the week.  Fuck you God."

Yesterday was officially ""Shit on Morgan"" day, so today was the best day ever...at least in comparison.  We had a pajama party in draping class, because we our last project was PJs so everyone that could fit into theirs wore them.  It was awesome. Of course, boobies were pouring out some scandalous ""pajamas"" that were in no way comfortable enough to sleep in.  I wore mine that were the best thing ever.  It was a green dinosaur with a funny face on the front and the bottom of the shirt was turned up like a cuff to make the bottom lip and there was a single tooth popping out over it.  Then there were spikes running along the back seams and the pants has spikes too as well as a giant, long tail.  It was so much fun, and since i dyed the fabric with hair dye...it kinda sorta maybe comes off a little, so my hands are green just from touching it.  I have yet to fins out where else got dyed....eep.  Lots of pictures were taken, and i was silly in all of them, hooray.  I gave my email to a bunch of people that apparently want to be my friend or something, haha suckers.  Like they'll call anyway.  The best part of the entire day was playing with this fucking adorable puppy that one of the girls brought in for fun.  I wanted to steal it, an 8 month old fluffy toy poodle.  The cutest, most playful thing ever.  I  got down on all fours and played with it cuz i'm cool and people took pictures cuz he was tugging on my tail.  Then the computer final i had was the easiest thing ever.  I had no idea what i was doing, yet i completed it and got an A in 10 minutes.  Amazing.  On the way home, i was carrying everything that was in my locker (aka fuck loads)and i took off my dinosaur pants because they're tight and i didnt want to give anybody reason to stare at my ass, but i kept the shirt on because i like it.  Once i got to st. marks, this old guy with a really big camera passed by me, and gave me one of those ""please make eye contact so i can say something) look that i hate SOOO much.  So i didnt look at him, passed by and got to my apartment.  As i set down my 50 bags of crap to open to front door, i see him right behind me and kinda looking at me....what the fuck.  I think he was following me and taking my picture.  Grrr....i think he just liked my PJs, which he should because they fucking rock."

"event","So i had my ""interveiw"" with the Sleepwear company Richard Leeds International"", but what a strange experience.  I walk into the bright white lobby, and there's mannequins eating cookies in PJ's on the ceiling, along with a bowl of candy, a night stand, all in fun, bright colors  I talk to the receptionist and then take a seat on the huge blue plush couch shaped like a cartoon moon, complete with a smiley moon face. The walls are bright white, as well as the floor and celings and everywhere is hand-painted writing in a spiral saying stuff like ""don't drink coffee, go to sleep, relax, veg out"".  It was just cool how it swirled all over the walls.  So i meet the first designer lady (out of the 3 that run the whole company) and she's wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt with sneakers, while i'm all dressed up in my grey wool pants and a button down shirt with crappy dress shoes.  What was great is that nobody knew anything about the internship, when i would start, what i would do, how many days a week i'd be there.  Nothing..they were asking ME about that stuff.  I'm like....errrr...as long as i get the $1500, i don't care.  ::gives a thumbs up::  They flipped through my portfolio, which i had just spent days and nights putting together stressing and stressing, and they really liked it.  They were most impressed with my figures, which i thought sucked the most, so who knows.  But i didnt have to show them my croquis book thank GOD cuz it sucked, and i brought along some of my actual projects, but i didnt bother taking out my breath-taking bustier when the company strictly did pajama pants and tops.  Duuuuh.  But the whole place is a lot of fun, soo many bright colors and pictures of looney tunes and all the other cartoon licenses they have all over the place.  All the chairs were zebra print, and the kitchen was a mini cafeteria with a ping pong table and fooseball.  It was sweeet.  I met Richard Leeds himself too, who quizzed me about the Deans of FIT, which i failed.  Oops. He was really funny looking though, and he was wearing this dress shirt that wasnt dressy, with splotches of pink, orange, yellow, green, and blue.  It was silly.  But the best part was definately that i was really worried about my blue hair, i even asked them before the interveiw if that was a problem.  I was thinking i might have to get a wig or something.  But gosh darnit, they loved my hair soo much, that might be a big reason why i get the job.  They kept mentioning how much it fit it there and that it matches some of the colors they were using in the new collection.  I better f-ing get it now.  The only other girl i know is interveiwing for the company is in my classes too, and she doesn't seem that fun.  Plus i'm prettier and have blue hair....dammit.  I better get it, thats all i'm saying."

"event","So i guess it isn't that weird to be embarrassed of your family, especially when your family is mine.  Why would my mom pretend she was flying here all the way from california to see my fashion show and spend time with me when she obviously didnt.  She flew in tuesday night at midnight, so stayed in jersey, then spent all day wednesday with this random guy thats her ""really good friend"" yet she even tells me that she has sex with him, no matter how much i tell her NOT TO SAY FUCKING THINGS LIKE THAT TO ME! JESUS! Oh, and did i mention the guy is married and lied to his wife to spend time with her.  Then thursday, she spent all day sleeping, because she's sooo tired, because its not like she spent the last week in florida vacationing on the beach, and before that in california, without a job or anything better to do for the past 6 months.  Oh wait, yes she did.  Fucking stupid.  Then on thursday, i manage to get 2 tickets to the 5:30 show and she doesnt even want to go, she goes out with her friend Tom instead and i brought my grandma.  Then, for the 8'o clock show, im standing outside on this huge-ass line, wondering what i'm going to do, because nobody had showed up yet, even though i told them to come at 7, it's 7:30 and theres just me and my grandma still.  They show up at the very last minute of course, my mom drunk cuz she was at a bar having drinks instead of ""spending time with me"".  What the fuck is wrong with her that she has to come to my fashion show ""the most important part of her whole fucking trip"" a half hour late and drunk.  I've decided that i have no respect for anybody that drinks anymore.  It makes me sick, it makes me fucking ill. I wanted to punch my mom in the face, much like this morning, when i walked to her hotel to help her move her stuff and 1/2 the ""luggage"" where cases of beer.  Then once she got here, she drank 2-3, even though it was noon, then she just HAD to smoke a cigarette and started yelling at me when i wouldnt' let her smoke out the window.  So she went on the roof, cuz 1 flight of stairs is a lot easier then 6. She's such a fucking loser.  Now, after her 3 beers, she's been taking a nap on my floor for the last 4 1/2 hours.  And she wants to go the movies with me tonight, but she's mad cuz i don't want to go to like...a 6 o clock show so she can go out with people and get drunk afterwards.  I don't even want her here anymore.  She can go back to CA and leave me the fuck alone for the rest of my life. All she would do then is complain that i didnt spend any time with her while she was here. Fuck her. Fuck Everybody. Anyway, i gotta go, the beast awakens and she wants me to entertain her while she drinks.  FUCK"

Mike Miller rested his hand on my shoulder for a few seconds as he made a point about some interesting aspect of the band, but i dont remember what because...hehe he's pretty.  Then on the way out, jodi and i ran into the new drummer who i've never heard of, but decided to talk to him soley because he was passing by.  haha, silly.  So we landed up talking to him longer then anybody else because...well there wasnt a hoard of girls that wanted to fuck him. But la te da, cloud 9 is fun...mmmm godhead ""Maaaaaaaaatt, can't i just make out with one??""

No stay-up-till-2am-the-night-before work...i'm relieved (of course), yet too confused and scared to enjoy it.  Arg?  I feel like i was more prepared to deal with starting to work hard again the 1st week of school, but now im getting humble with my 0 homework that i'm going to be suddenly bombarded, i know it..i have to be...
Eh, my only really dilemma is quite unworthy of complaining, if that's what indeed i'm doing.  I havent not slept with matt in about a month and a half (sleep= zzzz) Every single night we've managed to be together, so it's become habit and i dont want to stop...um...ever?  I guess my only concern is the puppies at the moment, that and Matt doesnt do his work so he can be with me a lot, which i know he shouldnt do.  I feel bad staying at his place and leaving joanna with the duty of picking up their doody at 7:30 am...I don't find it that annoying, I can only hope she feels the same way :)  I also feel bad that matt sleeps over the nights i dont stay there...maybe i just feel bad in general...but i thought i didnt?"

"event","So something extremely strange and quite suspicious happened at the motel i work at.  Sunday night, a guy checked in by himself wearing nothing but hospital scrubs.  He even had the little booties.  Monday morning, someone went to clean his room.  No one answered, but when they tried to go in, the deadbolt was on.  Then the office called the room and the guy said ""No service"" really abruptly and hung up.  No one really thought anything of it at the time.  Then tuesday morning, this lady Donna went into the room to clean it because the guy supposively checked out.  The room was COVERED in blood, piss, shit, pretty much every gross bodily fluid imaginable.  There was a pool of blood right outside the bathroom that basically trailed from the door straight to the other side of the room.  Blood was splattered all over the walls, the bathroom, the beds, the furniture, the CEILING! EVERYWHERE!  It was EXTREMELY suspicious.  The guy also left his cellphone, a ring, and a wad of cash in the sink with the water running...what the fuck?  Everyone, EVERYONE said to call the cops, but the owner said it was unnessecary....????  Two ladies spent the next 6 hours straight cleaning that room.  They had to throw away all the sheets and blankets and things, even the lamp shades.  I cant believe they didnt call the cops, it was definetly the strangest thing that has ever happened there.  What was even weirder is that the guy came BACK the same day and tried to rent another room and apparently had no recollection of staying at the motel before...and he was still in his hospital scrubs.  He even took his cellphone and stuff back, but still had no idea that he had stayed in that room.  So fortunately, they turned the guy away at least.  To get rid of him they recommended a motel down the street, then immediately called them to tell them not to rent to him.  Fucking weird....just fucking weird.  What if something did happen....there's no evidence left....?"

"event","So i got up at 7:30 this morning, a little earlier then normal, but i felt refreshed enough, plus i was starving.  I have been sick, i think it's sinuses for a few days now and it seems to only be getting worse. So i just watch TV and make myself some Eggos and my mom insists that i take these antibiotics that she had left over from when she had an insanely bad sinus infection.  I wasn't too keen on it, but i trusted my mom's judgement, stupid me.  I was watching The Sandlot on HBO and petting my doggy for awhile, then i got up to go get dressed and ready for work.  I noticed as i searched for a clothes that i couldnt quite stand up right and everything was blurry and weird.  I sat down, thinking i might have stood up too quickly or something stupid, but the feeling was getting worse instead of better, and i think my leg started to shake.  So i called my mom in and asked her what the hell she gave me.  She swore it was an antibiotic as i ran to the bathroom almost puking, almost passing out.  She found the bottle again and kinda just said ""oops"".  Apparently she had instead given me 650 mg of Percaset that she had been on when she got all her teeth pulled.  Holy shit.  I thought i was going to die.  I still might, i gotta go puke again.....there went lunch....shit.  So my mom felt really bad, of course, and had to call the dentist that gave her the pills to ask if i would be ok, then had to call me out of work cuz i was fucked up.  But she still kept on laughing, saying that it shouldn't make me sick and that people (Sam) take Percaset to get high.  Well fuck that, my body despises it.  I passed out twice, slept for 4 hours, and puked about 7 times now.  I hope i dont die.  Sigh...i hate drugs."

"event","So Medieval Times is DUH SHIT! It was so silly and perfect and Matt always says the best things.  We were rooting for the Black & White knight, which i thought was a lot better then sily green, yellow, yellow & red, or blue, but the red knight looked pretty bad-ass too.  Hehe, it turns out that the Black & White knight was a priest (so we kept cheering ""DO IT FOR JESUS!"") and the GREEN knight was the bad-ass rebel guy that pissed the royalty off.  Oh well.  Our guy landed up winning...kinda.  There was this whole story about there being a traitor among the 6 knights so the King made them fight to the death (YAH! YAH! DEATH!) so they all fought and our knight won, but then he went to be knighted (even though he was already a knight??) and it turned out this other guy was the traitor and killed him too :( Mwa haha, evil.  One of the horsies made a nice steamy poopie in the middle of the arena in the beginning too. :) The best part was leaving and driving alongside other people that were rooting for a different knight and going ""YAH! BLUE KNIGHT SUUUUUUCKS! WE KICKED HIS ASSSSSSSSS! BOOOOOYAH!"" 

Oh....so then the end of fun....we drove to Point Pleasant from there and slept on the fold-out couch.  The next morning, my mom decides that we're opening the pool.  What the fuck.  So we had to do shitty yardwork for HOURS and supposively i got bad sunburn on my back, but i dont feel it yet so shhhh.  People came and took away most of the furniture too, so now i have no idea where im sleeping.  So we finally got out of there and decided to go to the mall and buy matt some new pants. (yah, for the 2387328748435 time, i asked my mom to show me how to use the washer and dryer and she refused saying ""I ALREADY SHOWED YOU 1000 TIMES! AHHHHHH, IM A BITCH!"") So in other words, i ruined his pants cuz i dont know what the ffffffff im doing.  So going to the mall....sighh...i cringe just thinking about using my car now.  It's gotten in such bad shape since i left for school that everytime i go to use it SOMETHING ELSE GOES WRONG! So we head towards the bridge, which is ALREADY VERY traficcy, and the bridge goes up, OF COURSE, but right as we're getting off, my car decides to stop working.  By stop working i mean...i press the gas, gas pedal doesnt do anything.  Car shuts down AS im driving, and without power steering or power brakes, i make my way to the right lane and park.  Woooooow, that traffic was awesome.  The best was all the BENYS giving us dirty looks, as if we were just chillin' and this was fun for us.  So i call my mom (who comes in a bathing suit and a towel, haha).  Of course where my car stalls is big, stupid and uphill, right? Of course.  So our attempts at pushing it doesnt work.  We finally decide that my mom should get behind my car and push it with her front bumper.  It was pretty fun! The best was making this big turn without power steering. And im so glad i get shit from my mom about my car, because its my fault she didnt drive it during the freezing winter and left it baking in the heat unused.  BAH! 

So after getting yelled at for basically the entire day, I gave up and came with Matt back to PA.  Fuck it.  I told work i didnt know when i was getting back from NY so i didnt know when i'd be starting.  It's all good.  I just dont like being home, its horrible and theres no way to make it less horrible.  I wish i could work at the motel then teleport back to the apartment for the night, or better yet matt's...bah...life is fun, when it's not busy sucking really

P.S.- I keep having these weird dreams about my Dad chasing me.  It's really scary.  The first one was more like hide-and-go-seek, but not a friendly one, and i landed up in a strangers house hiding somewhere, afraid to move and praying that he wouldnt find me.  Im pretty sure he did too.  Last night I dreamed something about my car not working and me being stranded in the dead car somewhere i didnt know while he tried to get in.  We had this kind of baseball bat fight...and he kept repeating something that really scared me, but i dont remember what....fuck."

"event","So i decided to quit my semi-fun job at the tattoo/piercing shop and go the fuck home.  Whats the use with living in NYC if you dont have the money it requires to enjoy it! GRRR! So I called up the motel i work at back home, figuring that they might have their summer schedule all worked out already and i'd be screwed.  But luckily they were ecstatic that i wanna come back and im gonna clean rooms from 
9-12 six days a week and do laundry (approx. 12-4)all the weekdays.  Booyah, just the same as last year AND another raise.  No use working for minumum wage here (even though i get to hear about funny genital piercings and get 1/2 off anything i want pierced) when i have a job that i like dying to pay my $8.50 an hour.  So here's my plan for world domination: I stay home till late august and stash my cash, working as much as possible (cuz god knows theres nothing to do in jersey) so when i come back for school, i can actually do the things i want to (and of course pay for alllllllllllllll those school supplies) BAH! Get me the fuck out of here! 
On a not-so relating (but more disturbing) topic, I've become an amatuer nudist in the last week (sorry joanna, haha).  After i walk anyway, (especially the 1/2 hour walk back from work) i just feel so disgusting that i just striped and stayed that way.  It felt soooo good.  I like not having to give a fuck. I guess i'll have to stop that though :( haha, life is fun....especially when you dont think too much about that statement

P.S.- Its just plain insanity when no store in a mile radius has drink mixes"

"event","i dont understand why everyone is always so unhappy.  I truly considered myself extremely pessimistic until i came to FIT where i've found myself to be the little stupid ray of sunshine in everyone's ""horrible"" lives.  You are never born into misery unless you are a starving child in Africa somewhere with diseases you have no way of curing.  Being born in America in itself is quite a substancial feat, land of the free.  You make or break your future, no one else can decide that no matter how much they try.  To be strong willed is a wonderful thing, I guess, but its human nature to survive, so everyone has the nessecary quality, you just have to struggle.  I feel like obstacles feed my fire, make me work harder. Even when i give up on something, i come back to it less frustrated and 10x more determined to overcome it.  You can never ever give up on what you truly desire.  In my future, all i can see is my main goals in life, what i think will make me ultimately happy.  I have ideas on how to get the end of the path, but im open to any other paths that will bring me there, theres always risks and theres always things that arent going to work out.  Why bother to fret over them?  Theres no point wasting the energy. 

What i dont understand is alcohol.  I feel like im missing out on some secret.  I'm spending my college years writing philosophically in a fucking livejournal to people who wont even understand what im trying to say instead of drinking and partying like everyone else.  I guess im just a fucking moron.  Hooray for me. I could count the times i've drank on one hand and the times ive actually gotten drunk on 1 finger, for what other purpose then to SEE what the attraction was...BUT WHAT IS THE FUCKING BIG ATTRACTION!  How does it drown out problems, make everything all right?? How does feeling giddy and lightheaded help in any situation whatsoever?  Deep down everyone knows this, they must, but somehow it doesnt matter. It doesnt help you forget shit, it just adds to your problems.  And how about puking and hang-overs? They are a treasure.  Sometimes i wish i DID enjoy drinking, enjoy parties, its so simple, at least it would be if i had friends.  My quest is to find something that stimulates me as much as alcohol entertains apparently everyone else.  The sad thing is that it would be a solo project, and i used to have the heart for that, but i find myself being lonelier and lonelier the past few years.  But, like i said earlier, its my own misery that i created, and its my own fault im unhappy about this aspect of my life, but im still happy.  Im where i want to be, and thats all that matters right now, cuz im on the right path."

"event","Just when you thought there was nothing left to learn about Michael Jackson, there comes a magazine article that unearths a nugget that Martin Bashir somehow missed in eight months of filming the King of Pop for his TV documentary. According to an article in the new issue of Vanity Fair, Jackson hired a West African shaman three years ago to put a voodoo curse on Steven Spielberg, David Geffen, and 23 other enemies that was supposed to kill them within a week.

The Malian witch doctor, named Baba, reportedly slaughtered 42 cows and had Jackson bathe in sheep's blood to seal the hex. Jackson paid Baba $150,000 for his services, which apparently should have come with a money-back guarantee. For his part, Spielberg says he doesn't know what Jackson has against him; the director and the singer have rarely met. ''This is bizarre, but what else is new?,'' a Spielberg spokesman told the New York Daily News."

"event","So I apparently am i big enough slacker that my little daily entries dont work anymore....haha, man did i see that coming.  But i've been busy...of sorts.  I don't even feel comfortable writing about most of the stuff though, don't want anyone to hate me MORE then they do.  I went to the modeling thing for 2 1/2 on thursday, that was kinda silly.  I definetely didnt belong there...two of the other models were regulars and they were incredibly skinny and tall.  Then the other girl was just incredibly beautiful and had really cool hair and had a perfect body...yah, blew me out of the water.  I felt so silly and ugly in comparison.  Eh, ill get over it.  They all were there for like...8 hours too, while i was only there for 2 1/2, so their paychecks kicked mine's ass too.  Dammit.  
So the Lupin thing, eh? I dont even know what you all are thinking about that right now...i think im kinda afraid to know... He's just hilarious and adorable, and i really like him.  I dont know what else to say, but he's really fun to hang out with and stuff, so im hanging out with him.  Everyone liked him before he started liking me...so i hope that doesnt change...:(
So now im sick...apparently i have sinuses that i always forget about until i start getting sick again.  Its really annoying and stupid, but for now, im living with it.  I feel a LOT better then i did yesterday though...stupid medicine...being all...stupid and stuff...so...yah..."

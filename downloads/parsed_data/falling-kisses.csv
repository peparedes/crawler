"event","yea so im at school right now. in the library with ahmiya. shes writing letters to her friends back in georgia and i was just sitting here and i was like hmm ill write in my journal. my computer at home is gay and it wont let me sign in to read anyones journal and it will let me update and everything but it takes me like an hour just to do everything right so that it will actually work. so yea i just decided to take a break for a while until my computer works again. school sucks. everything here sucks. but its really weird because i dont really miss home. i just realized what assholes everyone over there is. except for olivia, kellen, and erin. erin and i dont really talk anymore but me and olivia talk like everyday. i guess she was my only real friend all along. shes stuck with me through everything and she still trys to keep in touch with me.  jessica is all stuck on her new friends now so she never calls me. i always have to call her so im totally giving up on that cause obviously she doesnt miss me enough to even try and keep in touch with me.  i kinda just wanna move to a new place again. because i hate it here but i dont wanna go back home really. i really  miss kellen. him and i were doing really good for a while and then last night we just got in this huge fight and i realized that after everything thats happened nothings really ever going to be the same. and i found out that like all of his friends hate me and like want to murder me which sucks but i dont even care anymore because those people were jerks to begin with. but i mean i dont know i really wanna stay with kellen and all but like i dont know. i know he loves me i just dont think he likes me. if that makes sense which it probably doesnt. its just that he never really has anything nice to say about me. its always just critizism. i dont know i dont really care. he can think waht he wants about me. i cant do anything about it.  cassy is moving away. and im going to have to go back to starting over again. because i hang out with her seriously like 24/7. i hang out with lauren sometimes but she has so many friends and i know she could never have enough time for me and her to have what me and cassy had. i love cassy shes so awesome. im going to miss her so much.  anyway, i got my cartlidge pierced and its really hurting me and i havent gotten any sleep for like a week because i went to a tanning bed and stayed in for to long and im sunburned on every inch of my body and when i say every inch i really mean every inch.  its horrible.  so everytime i even move just like a little i like start crying. anyway, i have to work tonight. works fun. the people are cool i guess. and me and cassy and my family are all driving to louisiana this weeked for my cousins wedding. its a 24 hour drive and theres going to be 7 people piled into a suburban its really going to suck. but it will be well worth it i guess. then i have to go to court on the 15th for my accident then im flying back to louisiana on the 17th then staying there till the 21st then its off to texas..oooh how exciting..not really. the only people im going to see are kellen and olivia and i guess im happy about that i just really dont feel like getting bitched at by my dad for the whole money situation when im going to see olivia for like what..an hour..and then kellen for like a little of friday and thats it because his stupid boss will probably make him work. but after that i cant go until summer so i should probably just enjoy the very little time i have with them.  but yea anyway. im really paranoid that a teacher is going to walk in and the bell just rang so laterrrr."

"event","so yea this weekend was freaking horrible...

me and my sister got into this huge fight and i have reallyyyyyyyyyyy bad anger problems and so i like went out of control and like kicked a freaking door and we thought i broke my foot so i layed in bed for like two days and i tried walking around and i felt fine. but now its killing me again.

THEN, last night my grandma came into town and me and my sisters(ginny and emily) wanted to meet her and my mom and rebecca at chilis. so we started driving over there and i was coming down  my street and some stupid 7th grade chick threw a rock at my car so of course i freaked out. and so i stopped at the stop sign and i turned the corner and i stopped my car well at least i thought i did, and i rolled down the window cause i was going to scream something at her and i looked forward and my car is heading towards a fence. and so i freaked out and my mind like went crazy and for some reason i thought the gas pedal was the brake so i pressed it realy hard and i slammed into the fence and then i turned my weel to the left and then i ran into a basketball goal and i finally got myself together and stopped my car. and when i looked up i saw my winsheild and it was shattered. and the first thing i thought was ""my dad is going to kill me"" so i got out the car and i was like shaking and i started like bawling and this lady ran over to me and she was like its okay hunny its okay and she got out my cell phone and called my dad and my mom and the sheriff for me. and so blah blah blah all that happened. anyway. i got a ticket for careless driving and i have to go to court on october 15th:\. my car looked horrible. the windshield was shattered and it looked like someone had broken off like a 6 feet piece of the fence and then shoved it into the front of my car. the basketball goal was like attached to my car and there were branches all over the hood and there was glass and leaves all over emilys seat. gosh, if the air bags wouldve popped out she would be dead right now. cause shes only like 8 years old. i feel so horrible. i probably wont get my car back but thats okay i guess cause i definatly deserve it. 

but ooooh guess what. subway and red rooster creamery both asked me to interview. im so excited but im really nervous. 

yea well im gonna go. lauren is pickin me up soon for bowling club. then cassie is sleepin over.:D"

"event","well today was an okay day. all the juniors had to go to the auditorium for an assembly. and i was like oh gosh here we go i have to sit and listen to the principal lecture. but it was actually really fun. i got in there and the had like a strobe light on and those colorful lights goin like everwhere and they had this really loud rap blarrin. and everyone was dancing. and he talked to us for like five miuntes about prom and homecoming and shit and then for the rest of the time everyone just danced. me and the people that i was sitting with just kinda sat there and made fun of all the girls cause NO ONE could dance. like seriously HALF the junior class was up there and i didnt see ONE good dancer. they all sucked. it was really funny. it just made me miss all my friends though. cause i know if we had that at my old school then all my friends and i would be jammin. it wouldve been grrreat.

so yea jess is being a bitch. i decided to talk to her about the whole me being sad cause she ditched me for anna situation and she fucking blew up in my face. i was like wow your a cool kid. so im done with her. i was like ""you and anna have a nice life together"" and she was like ""thanks we will"" wow. FUCKING BITCH. and so i just sat there and let her bitch me out. and she said that i wasnt being calm but really i was. she was the one that was screaming and everything. i wasnt doing anything. i was fucking crying. but she didnt give a shit nope nope nope. of course not. shes got anna now. so anyway at the end of the conversation i was like we'll both just go our seperate ways. and she didnt say anything so obviously she wants that. but whatever.

i found out some bad news today:\ but i cant really say anything cause i promised her i wouldnt tell anyone. so yea lets just leave it at that. 

my moms letting me stay  home tomorrow. cause i didnt do this paper so shes letting me stay home to do it. i love her.

so i love how jess and me are like drifting apart. such a cool feeling. :\ shes like all stuck on anna now. and im just like coool. they havent been apart from each other since friday after school. and so everytime i like call they just sit there and laugh at each other the whole time then i get put on hold for like 10 or 15 minutes then someone over there ends up just hanging up the phone and i wait and wait for a phone call back and never get one. i fucking love my life...

then last night jess called and she was crying and saying that she wanted me to move back. and that made me feel loved for a little while then after that it all went back to anna again.

i woke up and i was all excited to get my drivers liscense i was like whooo yea..

then my mom starts goin crazy cause we cant find my birth certificate.

we like for like an hour or so..

i call the dmv to see if i even need my birth certificate.

the guy asks me if i have taken my driving test.

i say no.

i call and schedule it.

the lady tells me i need to bring insurance.

i then remember that my permit expires today.

i call the dmv.

tell them ive taken the driving test already in texas and beg him to please just let me get my liscense cause my permit expires today.

he says no you have to come in and get a new permit.

i start crying.

my mom tells me to call the insurance people.

the lady is a total bitch. 

so i screamed at her.

she was like ""well i have to talk to your parents to make sure they really want you on the insurance and that your not lying""

i say ""well my moms deaf and my dad is on a plane right now so what do you wanna do lady!""

she says ""calm down and give me your house phone number""

i give it to her. knowing that we will probably miss the call.

i go to the dmv.

wait for an hour.

bitch at the people for making me get a new permit.

then they look at it and say...

""this doesnt expire until march. your fine.""

i feel like a complete dumbass.

i apologize.

we leave.

i continue to be a bitch to my mom.

we go to the mall...

i find some jeans i really like but...

theyre 100 dollars...

my mom takes them without me knowing..

and goes to the counter and buys them for me...

even after i spent the entire day bitching at her...

the insurance people called...

we missed it of course...

probably wont get to take my test tomorrow...

which means no liscense for texas...

i hate my life...

some one(not naming any names because i, unlike this person, dont stoop to the level of letting the whole fucking world see who im talking about) is being realllllllllllly fucking immature. we get in a fight. another person and myself apologize for something we dont even know that we did. dont get anywhere with it. it actually turns into something worse. the next day i apologize AGAIN for, once again, something that i didnt do. the person that i apologized to acts like everything is back to normal, and PROMISES me that nothing is wrong and oh, well, guess what. i just read it in her fucking journal that shes still 'upset' WOW. now tell me. HOW FUCKING COOL IS THAT!

IF YOU HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM WITH ME COME FUCKING TELL IT TO MY FACE! DONT ACT LIKE EVERYTHING IS ALLRIGHT AND THEN WRITE IT IN YOUR DAMN JOURNEL FOR THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD TO SEE AND MAKE ME LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUY!

<P>me and jess got in a huge fight yesterday. first because i left a comment in ralphs journal and she got mad at me because i shouldnt have gotten in between him and melanies little fight. and second because melanie has been nothing but nice to me and i shouldnt have done that to her. i didnt mean it in a bad way i was just simply giving my opionion. i understand where shes coming from defending her boyfrined and everything. but its a journel. of course people are going to say what they feel..but i dont know. anyway then jess and i got in a fight because i dont even know how the hell it started out but it ended up with me and jessie kern becomeing to good of friends or something. i guess she felt left out. so that went on like all day yesterday and when jessie k and i called to straighten things out with jessie w everything got 105454508548 times worse. it was horrible. </P>

mm im eating spaghetti right now. i love spaghetti. i could eat it everyday for the rest of my life and never get tired of it. its so freaking good!

i feel bad cause ive been promising my sister that im going to get her a screen name ever since like the first day we moved here and i keep putting it off and she just came up to me and she was like can you get my screen name please and i yelled at her. i dont know why im in such a bad mood. i had a pretty good day except for the whole fight with my mom thing. ahhh. im tired. bye.

ive been talkin to jessie kern on the phone a lot. shes so wonderful. its really nice to have her to talk to since were going through like the EXACT same thing. its so weird. we moved on the exact same day. her boyfriend moved away so she had a hard time dealing with that. so shes helping me through it. its really nice to have someone to talk to about all this. we both dont even wanna try to make friends. we just wanna be loners and then go home. i love her. its a shame we got so close AFTER we moved away from each other. but i just love having her to talk to. it makes me feel a whole lot better. :D

yes im watching mrs. doubtfire right now. this is like the 4th time ive seen it in the past three days. im such a loser. i seriously have no life. im either on the computer and watching tv or on the phone and on the computer. i like never get off this thing. its very unhealthy.

okay im going to sound really stupid but i really really wish i was smart. like seriously, if i could go back to like first grade and start school all over again i would do it and i would do well. cause i know im not stupid i just dont apply myself or whatever. cause i just dont give a shit. i wish i did though. i was reading a bunch of peoples journels today and i was reading this one girls and she was talking about politics and she was using like these huge words and then this other girl commented and was saying a bunch of stuff and i was like man i wish i could talk like that. wow. im a loser.

jessie is thinkin about moving to houston. i really think she should. the woodlands isnt a good place for her. and all those people that claim to be her friends are a bunch of idiots. they treat her like she doesnt even matter. i feel so bad for her. she tries so hard to fit into their little group and they just like ignore her. so she has like no one to hang out with. cause me and jess and then those other people were the only people she hung out with and then me and jess moved away and then those people just decided that they didnt want her in their little ""clan"" anymore. wow. im kinda glad i moved away from there. cause i realized what jackasses everyone is over there. except for a few people though like jess,kellen,erin,olivia,and joe. but everyone else is just so stuck on themselves and they treat other people like theyre not good enough to be in their little groups or whatever the hell you want to call them. yea i dont know whats up with me lately ive been bitching too much about things. i guess i just needed to get some stuff out. its unbelivable how horrible some people can be. god ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i wanna kill some of those awful people down there! curse you! k sorry. bye.

kellen called when i was playing volleyball (in the few minutes that i felt okay) and i missed it and i was so upset i almost started crying. so when i got home i was debating whether or not i should call him(he called me from his dads cell phone) but i didnt want him to get in trouble and then like right then he called me back. i was like ahhhhhhhhhh kellen! oh god it was so wonderful to talk to him. i miss him so much. i havent talked to him in like a week. his 17th birthday is on friday but im not sure what im going to get him yet:( i never know what to get him. he said its really boring in oklahoma. hes going home on saturday though so it shouldnt be too bad. i want to see him so bad!

i just got off the phone with my jessie kern. it was so nice to hear her voice. i havent talked to her since chilis. i cant wait to see here. i miss her a lot a lot a lot! i miss everyone. but sometimes i dont feel like anyone misses me. i dont want to sound like one of those dumbasses that does nothing and sits there but feels sorry for themselves. by the way thats so annoying. i hate those people that are like im fatttt and then they sit there and stuff their fucking face. i just wanna be like if you think your fat then why dont you do something about it! no offense to anyone. im just saying. it bugs me when people do that. and its so annoying when people sit there and theyre like im so ugly, i hate my hair, i hate my body...blah blah blah! its so annoying! ahhhh! anyways so what was i saying....oh yea..me talking about how i feel like no one misses me. yes i dont want to sound like one of those selfish overdramatic freaks but i really dont think anyone even notices that im gone. maybe except for kellen and jess but thats about it. everyone was like ohh everyones going to miss you yada yada yada but i dont really think anyone does. ahh fuck it. i dont care. its not like i have to deal with any of those people anymore anyway. so what the hell.i dont even know why i worry. later.

-sorry if ive offended anyone..trust me, that wasnt my intention. just giving my opinion on the way certain people say or do things. yea im not makin any sense. whatever. forgive me. :D

"event","i got home from boston last night at like 11. i didnt want to come home at all. i love it there so much. i think i wanna go to college there now. it felt like i was in heaven when i was up there. the weather was perfect. the houses looked like doll houses and there were SO many trees. and yes i love trees. i didnt want to leave at all.

the day we left to go there was also the day that my jessie left:( we left the house at about 6 and got to the airport and i had to tell my jessie bye..it was a sad sad time. i miss her...so anyways she got on her plane and then me and my family had nothing to do until 11. it sucked cause i had not gotten any sleep the night before and there was no where for me to sleep in the airport. so i was in a really bad mood. finally we got on the plane and we flew to atlanta, georgia and then we had to wait for three hours until our next flight so we ate at chilis. then we got on the plane and it was delayed one hour cause they had mechanical problems so we just sat there and i read the notebook.by the way, really good book. horrible ending. i was very disapointed. anyways so anyways they finally got the plane working and we landed in boston around 10:30ish then we had to go to the car rental place and they lost our reservation so my dad argued with those dumb people for like an hour and finally we got a car. so we drove to the stuarts house(nicest people in the world! ive never met nicer people than that in my life and probably never will! they were awesome!) so we were all up until like 1 talking and eating and i went to bed. the next day i woke up and got ready for brady's(the stuarts baby)baptism. so we went and it was really short. it was like 20 minutes. so that was cool then we all went back to their house for the baptism/4th of july party. there were a lot of people there. all of their neighbors and all of their family so it was really fun. they have a hugeeeeeeeee backyard with badmitten(i dont know if thats what its called) and that horseshoes game and just all this space it was so nice. so i ate and played badmitten with my dad and his friends and this guy that was almost 18 and just graduated from highschool, and my sister walked over to me and my sister was like katie can i show you something and i was like sure so i started walking and all of a sudden they both turn around and grab my arms and i was like umm whats going on and they were like ""youre goin in the pool"" and i was like nnnnno and so i sat down on the ground and the guy picked me up and threw me over his shoulder and i was like wtf?! and so he got to the pool and it was one of those above ground ones so you had to step up and so he put me down when we got to the steps and i tried to run away but he grabbed me and picked me up and climbed up the steps and jumped in and i was like umm wow okay i dont even know you. i was wearing ALL WHITE i was so embarrassed i begged my sister to go get me a towel. so i got out and went and changed my clothes and played badmitten again and then he came and we played for like 2 hours and then we got bored so we all went inside with my sisters and watched tommy boy. and all the alduts were being so stupid they were like ohhh kyle likes katie blah blah blah and i was like ummm shut up. so later i looked at my phone and kellen had called i was so upset that i missed it he left me a message saying that he couldnt call me until he got back home cause his cell phone doesnt work in oklahoma. i miss him so much. anyways so the next day the stuarts and my family all decided to drive to newport, rhode island. i love it there too. it was so nice. we went to this really old mansion and they gave us a tour of it. it was beautiful i want to live in that house. anyways so later we drove back home and mike(the dad) stopped my this seafood place and picked up a bunch of stuff. and we got home and we opened it and it was LOBSTER. ahhh so good! so we all ate and then we watched titanic and joe called me and we talked for like an hour. what a funny kid. i miss joe. i promised him that when i went down there we would have a ninja fight. haha long story..before i moved me, him, and jess were all at jessies house and him and i had a ninja fight. very fun. so yea. then i went to bed. and the next day we went to downtown boston. so prettyyyyyyyy down there. AH I LOVE IT. we went to this place called quincy market and we all got ice cream and we rode on this horse carriage. it was so great. then when we were walking there was this couple that looked about 13 or 14 that was standing there making out and they were like all over each other so every started screaming GET A ROOM it was funnyyy.  so anyways then it was time to say goodbye. i love those people. they were so great. i love boston too. if i dont go to college there then i am definately moving there when i get out of college. so wonderful. so we drove to the airport and got on our plane and then we arrived in cincinatti and we had to wait like 30 mins so my sister and i got starbucks then we boarded the plane and we watched this one show i dont remember what it was called but it was SO funny. and then we watched whose line is it anyway aslo a very funny show. and then trading spaces. it was funny cause the people got mad at the decorater and he quit. funny funny. yea sorry im just rambling on and on. i did not want to come home at all. i hate it here so much. if my dad came home and was like lets move to boston id be like hell fucking yea! I HATE IT HERE! I HATE IT I HATE IT HATE IT!

oh yea i talked to my dad again about going to houston and he said it was cool. but now i just have to work out the dates with my mom cause my aunt and my cousins are coming the same week that i was planning to go. so yea i my have to change that. maybe i can go on july 31st and then come back around august 6th or 7th..hmm..anyways..yea olivia is coming in two days. im vurrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy excited. i cannot wait! except her plane doesnt land until like 8pm i think so thats going to be a veryyyyy long day. shes only staying for a little while though. so if two weeks went by like two days then thats going to seem like nothing. then the day after that my aunt suzie and my aunt margot are coming. im so excited they are so awesome. 

oh yea i have pictures from boston. ill try and get those up here soon. but yea i have nothing else to say. goodbye.

"event","my kellen left for oklahoma today. im not going to get to talk to him for a while:( im saddened. i was thinking about him last night. and i started crying. i really wish i could see him. i was thinking about all the stuff we used to do together and our first kiss and my last day with him. it was so much fun. we went to blockbuster and starbucks with his brother. and we played pool and then he came over to the house that i was staying at and we watched caddy shack and shared a plate of lasagna. it was so sad when we had to say goodbye. i will never forget that. that was the saddest thing i think i will ever expierience. we both cryed:( i miss him so much...

i talked to my dad last night..and he says he doesnt remember ever telling me yes about going to texas..of course..i shouldve known that would happen. he always pull shit like this. i got my hopes up for nothing, once again. first with kellen coming over here and now with me going over there. wow im a dumbass..he was like ""well who is going to supervise you and kellen"" and i was like umm what are you talking about and he goes ""dont even try to tell me that your not going to see him katie im not stupid."" and then he was like we'll talk about this later. but that really means..NO YOUR NOT GOING! he was being so cool for like a month and then like one day he all of a sudden started being a jerk again. usually he doesnt let me go out at all but before i moved i was out driving around with some people and we were out until like 12 and he called me before i got home and he was just like oh well have a good time just come home whenever..doesnt seem that great but it is for me cause he usually doesnt let me do anything. and he NEVER EVER let kellen and i go upstairs and the last couple of weeks he was just like oh go upstairs and we would be up there for like 3 or 4 hours and he wouldnt even come check on us. once again, doesnt seem that great but to me it is...sorry ill shut up about that...

jessie leaves tomorrow:( im going to miss her so much. even though weve gotten in a couple fights while she was here it was still wonderful having her here with me. it meant a lot. cause i really needed someone. i can always count on her to be there for me. i need to treat her better. i dont treat her the way she deserves to be treated by me. shes been nothing but nice to me. and i just push her away. i feel really bad. i feel really bad about a lot of things ive done. if i could start my life over i probably would. ive fucked up a lot of things and a lot of my relationships with people and wasted a lot of time stressing over the littlest things. i hate myself for all of that. i wish i could start over...

i leave for boston tomorrow. ive never been to boston. my mom says ill really like it though...yup..

i painted my room brown. i loooooove it. it looks soooo fucking awesome. but my little sisters helped and they got paint like EVERYWHERE so we have to go buy white paint now and paint over a bunch of shit.yea it sucks..

olivia is coming on the 9th and stayin until the 14th. im excited. i miss her a lot. i miss all of my friends. i wish i could go down there and see everyone. but of course no cause my dad is a complete jackass...

well im sorry im just rambling on about stupid shit. have a good day i guess. bye.

i saw the notebook yesterday. best movie in the WORLD! GO SEE IT! i cried soooooooooooooooooooo hard. i think thats the hardest ive ever cried in my life. it was so sweet. i want that to happen to me. 

i miss my kellen so very much. after seeing that movie ive just been sad cause i miss him so much. i wish i could see him. and for some reason i have a bad feeling about the whole me going to texas at the end of july. because im going to boston this weekend with my family and my dad spent over $2000 for airplane tickets for us. and so hes probably going to pull some crap like ""oh i dont have enough money to send you to texas"" im going to kill myself if that happens. if i dont get to see kellen and my friends im going to lock myself in my room and just cry until im dead. i wanna see him so bad. i cant stop thinking about him. and i get so jealous when hes hanging out with all of his friends because i wish it could be me and him that are hanging out not those other people. i wish i was 18 so i could move back there and be with him until we could get married. 

well jess woke up now so im going to get off.bye."

"event","so um..kellen called me back. and he was being worse than before. not only was he laughing hysterically while his friends made fun of me but this time he gave them the phone and just let them say shit to me while of course..he sat there and laughed with the rest of them. i just wanted to like burst into tears. i cant believe he would do something like that to me. that was so rude. my friends would never make fun of him especially when i was on the phone with him and if they ever did im pretty sure i wouldnt laugh id fucking slap the shit out of them. i hate all those fucking kids he hangs out with. his little ""halo crew"" i hope they all fucking rot in hell. theyre all a bunch of fucking jackasses. i was talking to jessica about this a few minutes ago. and she was just saying how she doesnt know why i let kellen do that kind of shit to me and then still like kiss his fucking feet. and shes completely right. i like worship the fucking ground that he walks on. he is in complete control of me. i fucking call him back after we have a fight and apologize even if hes the one that fucked up. and when i say im pissed off and not going to talk to him right when he calls what do i do..i talk to him of course. cause im fucking weak. im pretty sure that if tomorrow he called and i hung up on him he wouldnt care. he wouldnt call back and try to talk to me and he wouldnt IM me or anything. cause he knows that ill just run back to him eventually. but thats why i always run back to him is because i know hes never going to come chasing after me and i dont want to lose  him so i just go ahead and do it. and i make myself look like a complete fool. i wish i was stronger in situations like these. if he really loved me then he would treat me the way i deserved to be treated and not what he just did tonight. im gonna go try to get some sleep.

me and kellen got in a ""fight"" last night. i dont even remember what about cause it led to something totally different. we almost broke up cause i was being  a fucking dumbass. i just think he deserves better than me and needs someone to make him happy and someone that he can trust and im obviously not any of those. so i told him that he needed to ""rethink"" our relationship. i regret doing that. were going to be weird for like a month now. PERFECT!wow i hate myself..

"event","well my summer is completely ruined now. kellen was supposed to come visit me before school started but thanks to his mother he cant come anymore.""its too soon. and you need to move on"" is what she says. bullshit. i fucking hate parents. they think they know everything and whats best for their child and everything. yea well they dont. moving me here is not what was ""best"" for me and keeping kellen away from me is not whats ""best"" for kellen or me. im not even going to get to see him when i go down there in september. i hate my life so much. one bad thing after another. the only good thing about this summer is that jess is coming. maybe she'll be able to get my mind off this whole kellen thing. i just want to cry and cry until i die. jessies coming on saturday. im happy. at least i get to see one of the people that i care about. i wish i didnt have to move. i hate this whole long distance relationship thing. it sucks. and as much as i want it to, i dont think its going to last much longer. eventually my parents are going to start limiting kellen and i's phone time and then we'll start drifting apart. i dont want to be hurt again. ive already had to deal with something like this in the past. and i really dont want to have to go through it again. i think im just going to run away. run until i die. then ill never have to think about this again. i hate seeing peoples away messages talking about how theyre at their boyfriend or girlfriends house. and i hate watching love movies. and i hate going anywhere seeing people together.i cant even look at my fucking LJ icon without getting sad. everything reminds me of kellen and all the great times we had. why did this have to happen to us. why not some other bitchy couple that doesnt deserve to be together. what did we do to deserve this. we always talk about getting married and stuff but i dont even know why i bullshit myself. its all impossible. kellen and i's relationship even working for another couple of months is imposssible. i just want to go home. i hate this place."

"event","the movers are here:/ i feel like crying. my familys pissed off cause i wont talk to anyone. they're probably packing up my computer today so i wont be online for at least a week or two. i was supposed to hang out with my joshua last night but my cell phone was being gay so i never got his call. im going to miss him so much. hes so awesome. kellen came over last night and we watched return of the king and ate a bunch of food cause my parents were trying to get rid of the food so we wouldnt have to take it with us or throw it away. i want to hang out with kellen like every day this week. but i dont know i dont want to be selfish so im just not going to say anything. i talked to craig online for the first time last night. hes a nice guy. i wish we wouldve gotten to be better friends.i dont really know what else to say. just that i wish i was dead so i wouldnt have to deal with all this crap. im sorry to anyone that reads this fucking thing. all i ever talk about is how im feeling sorry for myself about moving. ill try to talk about other things. but i gotta go help box some stuff i guess. goodbye.

"event","Well i guess i'm going through a bad patch, feel really down and confused. I was plannin on havin a really quiet weekend alone in the dark but of course life is never that simple. Although i'm gettin tired of work i guess the money is worth it, ""SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!"". I got home tonight and my skin felt like it was on fire. Been havin bad dreams and not being able to sleep well recently as well which doesn't help. Got to go into work tomorrow for a couple of hours which isn't so bad. All in all i think i'm falling apart lol. I'm startin to feel and think the way i use to and i don't want that. I think its just because i'm tired which is making me very short tempered. i'm so tired. think i'll go get some sleep in a min. at least i finish at 5 tomorrow. Ah well, things could be worse i guess, i shouldn't really complain. Life would be so boring if everyday was happy and fun. Right i think i shall go before i pass out. night all"

"event","Not much to do this early in the morning so i thought i'd update this. Going away in 2 days and god knows i'm lookin forward to it, just need to get away fromt this place. Just looking for to the simple life, sitting on the jetty with a couple of beer watching the moon shimmer across the ocean. The down side is that i've gotta go play golf with my dad, and i've never had an interest in the game but at least i can say i've done it. Laterly i've been thinkin how stupid it was not to go live with my dad last year, although sayin that i wouldn't have met some of the people i know now. in sayin that how can you miss something if you hav never had it. i woulda got bored livin in cayman anyway, and my dad can be such a boring fart sometimes. just fed up with this place, feel like i mite go insane at any moment but of course i won't. think i just need a bit of focus at the moment or maybe a goal and purpose. think i'm just havin a bad week, but the wheel keeps turning, you never now what's gonna come round the corner. maybe i'll meet a really cute girl out in cayman who is the daughter to a millionaire or something lol yeah i wish. Its really weird though, in the last 2 years i've got so much more confidence and everything. i am one arragant son of a bitch though but i love it lol. if i met me i'd probably wanna punch me after 5 mins lol. you can't help who you are though, if people don't like it then who cares. i'd rather have a small group of friends that i can really trust than lots and lots a friends that i can't. there's only a couple of people that know all the different sides to me anyway. i don't like to keep secrets about myself though. or lie about myself, aint smart enough for all that bullshit. in like year 7 and 8 i guess i use to lie about my past but i always use to get caught out and mayed to look a right fool, so it just aint worth it. people can always tell when i'm lying so again it just aint worth it. 

I'm so so bored now, can't be bothered to sleep today, think i shall just get some stuff done and pack and all that shit. 2 things i hate about holidays..........  packing, and traveling, i fucking hate them so much."

<i>""And The Vampire was all that remained on<br>the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to<br>regrow life from the dead.  But as she was<br>about to give the breath of life, she was<br>consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the<br>cycle began again.""</i>

Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek)<br>and Isis (Egyptian).
The Vampire is associated with the concept of<br>death, the number 9, and the element of fire.
Her sign is the eclipsed moon.

As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic<br>individual.  You may be a little idealistic,<br>but you are very grounded and down to earth.<br>You realize that not everything lasts, but you<br>savor every minute of the good times.  While<br>you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you<br>have strong ties with people that will never be<br>broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have<br>because they are sensible.

"event","As usual i can't sleep. Everytime i start to nod off i suddenly get disturbing thoughts that wake me up again. Its not like a nightmare but more like a day dream thing. I think its most likely cause i've got so many thoughts going through my head that its my way of working things out but i thought i'd give this a go to see if any of it makes sense, and plus i don't have anything else to do.

My head is so confused and messed up right now, so many things i don't understand and keep going through my head. I've had headaches all day, probably because i'm so tense at the moment. My hands are a mess as well, bleeding and itching all the time, drives me insane, and they hurt most of the time. Not really much i can do about that though at the moment. Other than that i guess i'm fine physically.

My sister is still making things very difficult for me, saying that i'm a parasite and trying to turn the family against me. Mum sticks up for me most of the time but its getting quite hard for her. Its all fun and games though. Life would be so boring if everything was happy and fun. At least i'm not coming off my happy pills till easter now. Although they don't do much i'd probably be worse off them, but i'd rather not be dependant on a little white pill. I've got to start doing all the exercising stuff more, been slacking off over christmas. Trouble is the other night when i tryed to do some boxing training, my fingers split open and started bleeding, didnt notice till after i'd finished. 

Although its not the best way to deal with things, some people have been inflicting cuts on themselves. I can see what the idea is, to feel the pain and to know you're alive or something like that, but i can't see myself doing it. I guess i'm too much of a wimp to start hurting myself lol. Most of the time it seem to be because of the opposite sex which is kinda depressing. Everyone has there own opinion on what love is, and none of those opinions are wrong. Love is just a word that describes a feeling. I don't really understand what love feels like but in my mind, if you love someone then you want them to be happy, to put them and their happiness infront of your own. In sayin that i'm just a hopeless romantic lol, luv all the sopy romance movies lol. For a very long time i've wanted a relationship, but tonight i realised i didn't. I just want half of what a relationship is. I'm not very good at the comitment thing anyway, i get very freaked out by it actually. In sayin that i don't think i could be a player, just not me. Kinda feelin like there's something wrong with me, but i guess i shouldn't. Some people just aint right for each other. You can't change the way someone feels and would you want to if you could. Knowing that that person wasn't with you cause they wanted to be. Would be nice to feel something though. I mean i think we can all say that it feels good just curling up with the opposite sex, just the safty and comfort. Everyone seems to be havin relationship issues at the moment though. The doc said that it was the wrong time of the year to come off my pills and i can understand why now, cause everyone seems to be depresst at the moment. 

Difficult decision coming up in the next 3 months which i shall have to think about in great detail. When my dad does finally return to the u.k he shall probably be posted somewhere else. And the most likely place is florida. Now the question is, do i go with my mum and dad, or stay here and have the house to myself. I could actually get use to living on my own. Get a full time job keep me busy and get more money in. Will always have the pooch here anyway. But i guess i don't really have to make a decision yet. Miss my dad so much right now. Use to be able to have conversations with him that were hours long but seemed like minutes. Would be too expensive to do now lol.

Bloody hell i've been writing this for an hour now lol, think i shall go lay down for a while and try to sleep. Actually i kinda feel a bit better after typing all that, probably makes no sense though lol"

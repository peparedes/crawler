""A tribute to a spirit.

You helped me, Michael Valorien. I owe you my life. Too many times last night you made me smile. Too many times last night you fed my hunger for answers. Too many times last night I wished you the best in life and more. Although you've helped me live the first few days of this new life...I still can't sleep and fall into dream to save it.

I finally found you hiding from me in the shadows. You taught me of my sickness. You taught me forgiveness. You taught me about who I am and to accept it. You understand me more than anyone. Your stories of bone crushing demons, blood and regret, I knew them all too well. I've dreamt of those times, too. You artist. You storyteller. I believe every word you say. Joke or not. Everything you've taught me I take to heart. You are my teacher. My open book. My novel. Your student, Your ""Angel"" will always give you her full attention. Always.

It caught me off guard that you noticed first off who I was. A cynic. No one else ever gave it a second thought. You said you started looking for me long ago, before anyone else even spoke a word.

Reunited. Not torn apart anymore. If only we could talk forever. Like you said before I left: ""We become useless when we're apart, you and I. But we could be Everything if we just wished for it. Even if it's just for each other.""  For once my tears are happy. For once.

My words go out to you, Protector of all things sacred (My heart being one of them). I am no longer fighting this war alone. Please don't leave me in the dark again. I need you now more than ever.

I think everything is going to be okay now. Just as long as we're together.""



Fuck.   Fuck fuck fuck.

Digging holes into the past is usually never a good idea.  I miss him too much. That's all."

"event","Michael Quinn

For those of you who never met him, or do not know his affect upon me...then I'm sorry.

Michael Valorien Quinn was the heart and soul of my life. The focal point of my so-called existence. He spontaneously plucked me from the earth, extirpated the monotony from my thoughts and feelings and brought them closer to the light. It's because of him why I see things the way I do now, Lustrous and ever-flowing. A long string of odd events and surprises, as opposed to my former failed attempts and constant disappointments. He is the reason why I can't sit still to save my life. Thanks?

Sure, my time with him was short-lived but I don't like to see it that way. For little over a year he took me in, nursed me, taught me, instilled morals into me, gave me something to appreciate in life. So far, it was the best year I've ever had. I still remember how every morning I woke with a vigor. There was such a strong passion, a ceaseless drive to find what it was he was so searching for all those years...that haunting truth of life that is always just beyond our fingertips. He strived for it. More than anyone else I've ever known.

And I believe that truth exists somewhere. Even now.

I'm thoroughly convinced that he was killed by that thirst for knowledge. The curiosity of what comes next after all this. It was all he could ever talk about. Often, he would grab me by the shoulders, his breath smelling like bitter cognac, smiling that insane grin of his. Then he would shake me and scream his frustrations to me until he couldn't breathe. Moments like that scared me, but they were always short-lived. Moments like that are the reason why I believe the ignorance of life destroyed him. I'm almost sure of it.

Hopefully I'll get the chance to ask him about it someday.

Today, four long years ago I got that call from his brother telling me what happened.  The empty bottle of gin on the dresser, the blood on the bathroom tiles, the screams of his mother. It was more than I wanted to hear. He said there was a note. I still never read the whole thing. I can't recall if I was crying just then or not. But I know for a fact, I wasn't breathing.

I'm crying <i>now</i>. Of course.

For months, I hated him for what he did. Now, I hurt too much to consider anger again.

When he took his own life, he took a large part of mine along with him. I guess I should be upset with him for that, at least. But I'm not anymore. It was his to take. It's the least I could give up for all the pieces of himself that he had given me back then.

He taught me how to feel again. It's more than anyone else has ever done.

Even though It's been years, I still love the fuck out of that guy. And if I ever get that chance to see him again, there's only one thing I could say: ""I hope the answer was worth it, fucker.""    ....then I'd most likely punch him in the nose.


Happy deathday, Michael.


You always told me that I was ""too much""...But you were my Everything.

I miss you."

"event","...in another jumbled state of spectacular madness. Been feeling nothing short of completely hopeless. It seems like every day I experience something else that reminds me of -... Yeah, well. Forget it. This isn't what I wanted to write about.

Heartbreak. That is what's really on my mind lately. Or my heart, I should say. Whichever. So I'll talk about that.

I'd really like to know, does it ever stop feeling like this? Will I eventually get to take another breath that doesn't feel so strangled? I'm pretty sure I will in time(and lots of it), but right now its nearly impossible to keep optimistic. Friends might help (if I had more than one). And it would be a lot easier if I had someone else here to confide in about everything (why do I always have to be the catharsis? Geez.). But seeing as this was mostly all their idea to begin with...who knows? They said it was poisonous, that I needed to stop suffering over it so much. Claimed I had to get out of it and that I shouldn't be dependent on something so out of my reach. They are right. At least I hope they are. Otherwise, what am I doing all this for? They've always looked out for me before...or that's what I keep telling myself. I dont know anymore. I'm being vague again.

Bleh. I cant sleep, eat, think. Been completely useless. My own lethargy is getting on my nerves. I want to be over this. I want to be over -....Fuck. See? I know I didn't want to write about this, and here I am doing it anyway. I'm rambling. But I'm allowed....it's my journal. So, I'll continue.

I know that this is my fault. My choice. It shouldn't hurt this much. But it does. Or maybe it hurts more <i>because</i> it was my choice.  Is that possible? Oi...I admit it...the guilt is overwhelming. Although it's nothing compared to my emptiness. I don't even want to know about how they feel. Or do I? 

Bah. Guilt.


At least I'm trying. Besides, it wouldn't have worked out anyway. Right? Right.      .....Right?


Yep. Hopeless.

Fuck. That's not even the worst part! The worst part is that I can't even drink this blip away because lately, alcohol tastes just as disgusting as I feel. I blame neurotransmitters (nasty little things). Damn you. -shakes fist-

Perfect. I'm trying to joke it all away. Or maybe it <i>will</i> be amusing in the future when this is all over. Hopefully, someday all this grief will be replaced by happier times. Hey, it's possible. Well, on Opposite Day, anyway. Right? Damn.


That's it. I'm getting fed up with myself again. I don't deserve to wake up in the morning...Or ever, for that matter.


Just perfect.




P.S. I'm dropping out of school so the rest of my future can fall apart, too. So, rest assured...it wasn't just yours.

Now what? What on earth am I going to do with myself? Im not happy either way."

"event","Yep. I'm still distant and I'm still uninterested in changing that. It's my burden to bear, so deal with it.

Some people need to ease up off me lately. Dependency has never been something I get thrilled about, anyway. It's frightening to have others who need my constant attention and reassurance. If you need it, then I'm not the person for you. It's exhausting to maintain everyone else's well-being. Hell, I can't even carry my own. It doesn't make any sense. Where is <i>my</i> time?

I care. I love. I listen. But, please, don't make me your daily catharsis. If you can't function normally without having to spill your guts to me, then it's a serious problem. That type of responsibility is terrifying. I'm emotionally unreliable and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I'm too young to be responsible for another human being. Period. Happiness can only be found by the seeker, himself. The dude holding the sign is just a dude holding the sign. Let me be the dude. (What?)

All I do is try to keep my head up, but then I always get bombarded with the 'Why are you acting so cold?' bullshit. Cold? No. I'm trying to keep strong, like you said. Just keep trudging through the sludge. Growin' up. You should be proud of me.

There's only so much empathy out there. And, sadly, I cannot supply all of it.


Is a break too much to ask for? Apparently so.




Ha. It's too bad that the people who these posts usually apply to don't read this thing anyway. Perfect."

"event","By leaving behind my life of daily journaling, both online and off, I was hoping to be able to leave a large chunk missing of my documented nightmare that I call 'existence'. 

Well it seems like I'm back, and all I've managed to conclude by this little ""break"" is that I've developed new amnesia-related symptoms as to how the hell I've gotten where I am today. Not where as in <i>where</i> but figuratively speaking, of course.

It seems like some kind of huge joke now that I'm looking back on it all. Things that once seemed so small and insignificant, are intense and inflated.  My relationships with people have decayed and I'm left to wonder if it was all worth it.  The more distant I get from them, the better I feel. Or that is, until the loneliness sets in. It aches in places I didn't know I had in me.  The constant anger mixed with fear and morose feels like something I can no longer handle.  The strength I had before is used up. And a part of me wants to reach out, hold on to someone. Anyone.  But the other part says I'm better off leaving others out of my reality-based horror story. Self-sacrifice was always my strong-point. Ha.

Anyone else in my place could possibly come out of it unscathed, but I know I can't do this alone anymore. A few years ago, people used to support me through times like this. Now I have nothing and no one to account for.  They've all gone, been buried or moved on.  Mostly my own fault. Why have I been so careless?

Mother. She has ruined me as a person and as an idea. Every night I pray to whatever god that is listening that she destroy me before I can destroy her.  I'm not a killer and I'm not a saint, but I cannot trust myself to be around her anymore. Not now, or not ever.

My conscience is slowly dying away. I have no inhibitions. Sometimes I fear I'm losing all control, like a monster is raging inside me.  It's hard to breathe from the feeling. I get overwhelmed easily and it takes a moment to calm myself before I can look at her again. All I hear as she speaks to me is my heart thundering in my ears. Always distracted. Is she apologizing or is she attacking me?  Who knows. I can no longer hear her. She never apologizes.

I'm becoming undone. Someone else. Dangerous, maybe. But mostly to myself.


The next time I lose control, might be my last. 
Time is a terrifying idea...and I fear I might not have much of it left.



What a way to come back to the writing world, with a vague hello that sounds awfully like a goodbye."

Too many thoughts all at once again.

Which is stupid, since in exactly two weeks I will be on a plane to Dublin.  It should be a happy time.  Although, I have an awful feeling that the whole entire trip I will be haunted by the thought about having to eventually come home to the same dispiriting existance I left behind.  

So I was thinking, instead of worrying about it, I want to change it.  I've decided to make all the wrongs (or most of them, anyways) right and fix what I've been putting off.  Emotionally I'm not ready for this trip or my new decision.  I'm not sure if I ever will be.  All I know for a fact is I need to do something about this quickly.

My heart is hurting a lot lately.  Maybe it's nervousness or excitement.  Although, it feels much deeper than that.  After everything everyone has told me, I can't help feeling like I'm still all alone in this, stuck with the big gaping hole in my chest, eating away at me like some kind of massive parasite.  It's more scary than annoying, really.

After reading all this over, I cant help but laugh about how lamentably childish I sound.  It's almost disgusting.

You know, I've had this feeling before, now that I think about it.  It was a long time ago and it took insanely too long to recover from.  Perhaps, yes, maybe I have a broken heart.  

And it seems like the person I want and need help most from is never around anymore.  What a dilemma.  There is so much I have to say, but I never get the chance.

To whom it may concern:  Please, listen to me.   I don't like where I am...and I want to get rid of the blues, most of all.


Last thought for the night:  I wish I was a better liar.  It would make everything so much easier."

"event","Arrgg.  And it only gets worse.

I should really be happy about many things.  I have an amazing family and I will be leaving the country in a few weeks, but lately it seems like I just keep falling into places I cant get out of.

My thoughts just keep eating at me and I can't sleep. My guilt is high for unknown reasons and all the people around me seem short tempered and angry.  The tension with finals is causing everyone to get stressed and grouchy, but I'm not stressed about finals.  No, not at all.

You see, I've got finals in the bag.  I'm going to pass all of them. I'm confident and I've decided.  My recent problem is that I keep fucking up everything else that actually matters.  Trust seems to be a big issue.  I've been accused of telling a big lie.  Yet, the person wont tell me which lie it is I've told.  So either THEY are the one lying or I need to learn when to shut the fuck up.  This person isn't exactly trustworthy but the thought wont seem to leave my head.  I've become obsessed with this person's irrational anger and wondering what could I have possibly said and to whom?  I'm not much of a liar, nor am I good at it.  What reason would I have to begin with?  Whether or not the person was full of shit, I can't help thinking maybe it just slipped my mind.  Many things lately have been slipping my mind.  Big things.  This is what is bothering me most.  Not this supposed ""lie"".  Fuck the lie.  Big deal.  Although it would have helped me out a lot if they had the nerve to tell me what it is I said.  Pansies.

Lately, I've been compleltely alone, writing papers, staying up until 5 am, frantically saying words of encouragement to myself (to no avail).  I'm just floating around in life with no direction and I want to finally do something about it.  Put a stop to it and get out there.  But, I have no guidence whatsoever and everytime I try to persue something, it blows up in my face.  

To top it off, it's that hopeless time of year again.  Summertime.  Where all I did as a kid was sit on my ass and get fat and stupid.  I have always HATED summer.  And now that I will be gone for most of this one, I should be having a good time for once.  Yet, there are way too many struggles here that if I left them behind unfinished, they will never be resolved.  Sure they aren't that important, but I know for a fact the thought of them will eat at me the entire time, making the experience not as great as it could be.  In a way, I'm disappointed with myself...but I am doing all I can to fix things before it's time to go.

The next time I sit around with my friends or have a smoke at the park, I know I wont be happy about it.  Their irritibility has constantly been taken out on me and it reminds me a lot of my mother.  For this reason, I don't think I will ever feel comfortable around them again nor do I trust them.  A huge secret I confided with ONLY them has already leaked out and I feel somewhat betrayed.  But I never got angry with them.  Ever.  I figured they were just too immature to have someone trust them and I sort of pity them for it.  I'm done with it.  If anyone should be angry, it should be me.  This was probably the most important information of my life and they proved to me how it is they felt about it.  Now they have the nerve to get pissed at me for something so small and irrelevant.  It's amusing really.  Besides, I was getting tired of how much attention they demand from me.  I have responsibilities and lately they've been most of the reason behind my slacking.  

Haha. Already, I'm brooding and feeling pretty anti-social.  Like I have nothing to say out of disgust over myself and their behavior.

I hate summer.  It's the time where everyone goes on those mindless adventures and come back with amazing stories to tell.  This year, I'm going to leave everything behind and there wont be stories to tell.  Ireland will be for me to know and I will make sure to be selfish about my time spent there.  

Although, I'm still pretty sure I'm going to be worrying about everything back home...because I am a dumbass."

I've been up pretty much all week (with the exception of a few naps here and there) wondering whether or not this place could finally give me that sense of ""home"" I've been searching for.  Perhaps.

Things have just been truly amazing lately.  It's been a week since my surgery and I'm doing fantastic.  I can now do almost everything I could before with very little pain.  Sneezing, walkign fast and climbing stairs still hurts like hell, but that'll go away soon.  It seems that the surgery's done the trick though, seeing as I havent gotten violently sick yet (7 days without feeling like death is a new record for me).  So I'm very optimistic.  I've had alot of support and my family has been very understanding about the llooonngg trip I will be taking and are trusting me completely for the first time. 

Excitement!  I will be all alone in the place I write and dream about most, studying art while relaxing and enjoying my surroundings.  Can't really do that in Los Angeles, way too busy.  I keep thinking about being surrounded by such positive culture (not to mention I can legally drink there. Score.) and learning about stuff they dont teach in school. Alright, so mostly I'm excited about being able to use the Gaelic I've learned over the years and feeling like I fit in somewhere(and the drinking).  By the way, this is my first time out of the country so I'm hoping to experience some super culture shock.  My Irishness is gonna take over and before you know it, I'm going to have the coolest accent and eat nothing but potatoes. I hope. 

Tomorrow will be Adrian and I's one year together.  He's been so good to me.  Yesterday he took me places and bought me a movie, over $25 worth of candy (oh boy), and then we went to the book store.  Such a wonderful guy.  I love him very much and I hope I will be able to say all this again next year.  <3.

"event","There' s so much on my mind.  I want to feel safe, but I can't figure out why I don't feel that way now.  I'm two days away from starting my Spring semester and my much dreaded doctors appointment. 

This semester is going to be completely twisted.  It could be that Lauren will now be attending school on my campus (which I'm not to fond of...for obvious reasons.  But what can I do about it?  Nothing.).  I've been finding myself in the most peculiar situations lately.  I dread going to the coffee shop that makes the best chai tea I've ever had, because of who I'd run into there.  The last thing I want is more confrontation and drama.  Can't things just be normal and less complicated?


I have a lot of worries.  Not really about school...school is always a breeze.  I dunno if its my up coming appointments that are getting to me...but I've been missing many meals.  This week alone I've dropped more pounds than I've eaten.  Its not good.   Is it possible that I could just be so preoccupied doing absolutely nothing that I just forget?  Perhaps.


Anyways, I did get to see Alice Cooper on Wednesday.  Tommy Shaw, Gilby Clarke and Jack Blades were there too...Plus many more intriguing people.  It was really fun and an awesome show.  Laughed a lot.  Sang a lot.  Adrian seemed to enjoy himself, too.

Now, I dont really know what to look forward to.  Everything coming up in the next few weeks is not really something ANYONE should look forward to.  I just wish I had some decent friends to give me some support.  Maybe then it would seem less horrible.  Maybe.


But everything in that department seems to be coming up empty.  Ah well...there's always Fester.

"event","Today started out like a good day.

I talked to my mom about things that really needed to be put out there and I finally had the guts to do it.  There was surprise ice cream sundaes from my dad.  Listened to the new Rent soundtrack for about three times through as we drove around showing off my dad's new awesome wax job done on his car.  We laughed and bonded for what felt like the first time in years.


Then....we came home to find my turtle, which I have owned for over 10 years, torn to bloody pieces and his insides strewn about the entire backyard.

Raccoons.

My dad almost got sick at the sight.  I cried.  My mom dropped the lawn chair on her foot.

I realized I was standing barefoot on what was left of his left leg.  


Horrible.


What an end to such an optimistic day.

We burried him near his favorite flowers.  He was part of my family.  And Yes, a turtle can be part of a family.  


P.S.  Fester, my cat, is devastated.  They were buds...aside from the jealousy."

Ouch.  In my mom's word ""He's such a dick"".  Thanks mom.



In other words, I'm still worrying about alot of things.  And I know I shouldn't be...but I can't help it.  You would be, too, if you had some of my experiences with hospitals.  I dont feel like saying what it is exactly I'm worried about because once it all blows over I'll look back and probably feel embarassed...but I really don't trust doctors.  Especially when it has to do with them sticking things in my insides.


I feel sick just thinking about it.  Can't keep my mind off of rubber gloves and the smell of antisceptic.  

I hope they know what they're doing and my pain will feel better afterwards.

"event","I've been thinking about the past two yeas alot lately.

In that short amount of time I've met a whole lot of amazing people and have been to so many places I never even dreamed of going.

Although 2004 was probably my worst year luck-wise so far,  2005 proved to be the best.  Now I can't help thinking what 2006 has in store for me. I'm not hoping for it to be ""the best year ever"".  I'm just hoping I will learn a lot...and hopefully things will slowly become easier as I make a life for myself.

Who knows.  I haven't been sleeping again.  Yet I have way too much energy.

I'm excited today and I have a reason.  I am going to see Alice Cooper soon.

A long time ago, I used to play guitar and bass with my daddy.  We must have learned like every Alice Cooper song ever set to record.  Right now, as I listen to ""be my lover"" I'm laughing at the memory of him and I (what might have been around 5 years ago or more) playfully serenading my mother.  Those were good times.  

He was so proud of me, then.  And growing up, I didn't really give my dad anything to be proud of me for.  But he never gave up on me.  Sure his other 3 daughters are doctors, lawyers and real estate agents, he's proud of me for different reasons.  I am myself and I'm determined to find what I love to do and try everything possible to make my life part of it. Whether I be a musician, artist, professional sky diver, race car driver, lion tamer...he doesn't care.  I'm the only daughter of 4 he's had the chance to raise and I think he did a hell of a good job.  Just as long as I'm not french, an animal activist or an anti-war protester, he'd support me (bummer)...or I could if he doesn't find out. ;-)


I know that when I see Alice Cooper all those good times we've had and I've forgotten are gonna punch me in the face.  

And I can't wait!"

Although my brain has become very tired from trying to remember all the meanings behind the cryptic entries, I've succeeded to have the best nap that I've ever had with my face burried into the belly of my cat, Fester.  I woke very suddenly from a dream-twitchy paw in the eye.  Now I am grumpy and my eyes itch.

I feel better now.  This past weekend has definitely been much needed.  MUCH. As that alarm hit midnight to bring in the new year, there were screams and explosions (-wink-) and although rain put out much of the sounds outside, it was comforting. 

This weekend was the greatest vacation I could ever have.  Even if I spent it inside and was getting dive-bombed by a certain orange cat every 20 minutes as I tried to sleep.  It was well worth it.  Now I'm in my own bedroom looking around at how familiar everything is.  I don't like it.

My dad has been outside all day sitting in his car playing music obnoxiously loud with his new speakers.  My mom has been trying on all her new clothes since morning.  Me.  Well, I've been sitting on my ass watching Jerry Springer and reading books for the past four hours.

This week has been great.  Rewarding, even.

Alicia, Darren and I got to hang out.  Which was great!! I haven't seen ""Navy Boy"" Darren in like...almost a year!  But it's just fantastic (yes I said ""fantastic""!) to have friends that can pull me out of any stressful situation and make me laugh until my sides ache. I saw my family last night who I never felt comfortable around before and we ate stuff, played monopoly (ADRIAN IS A CHEATER!) and talked about stuff.  I got some really awesome and thoughtful gifts that made me realize...they DO know me!

On top of all that finals are over, DONE!  Friends and (horrifyingly) family are all screaming for some love that wasn't really there throughout the rest of the year.(I like it now that I'm not so busy.)  My new years resolutions are still being made.  Organization is pretty much down.  I'm creating new beginnings with people I've had a falling out with.  I'm making and receiving some solid promises.  Everyone is changing around me and I'm very proud of all of them for being happier and goal oriented.

My little friends are going to college...and I'm SO proud.  There's new relationships between my close friends that I couldn't be happier about.  Romance is so strong everywhere.  The people who tend to drag me down are out of the picture (for the most part) and I have nothing keeping me back today.

Everyone seems very content this Christmas Season.  Maybe the curse of Erin's unlucky Christmases is gone??  Who knows.  I hope so.


I feel AWESOME that I can just sit here, quietly reading with my family all around me, laughing, eating sweets and reliving embarassing moments.  It's uplifting.  I've never had a christmas like this.


For all who is responsible for making this the best Holiday I think I've ever had:  Thank you.


Now to get back to that book...Have a great Holiday, everyone!"

It's crazy how I'm not even nervous.  They've become just an inconvieniecne.

Lately, I've been wanting to be sparatic and do things I normally wouldn't  have time for(ex. take tons of pictures on a walk, go sit in a park I've never been to and write, watch movies that make me laugh or bring back good memories, bake until I've run out of ingredients).  Everyone has been wanting my attention.  At first, I thought it would be great.  But, now I barely have alone time.  Ouch.  I'm not sure which is more valuable really.  I love my friends and family...but I really need to gather my thoughts sometimes.

Its getting a bit ridiculous.  People calling me passed 1AM to see what I'm doing the night before/morning of finals.  C'mon people!
Arg, Lauren. I can't help wondering why she wants to talk to me so bad, lately.  Could it be that serious or is she just bored and wants to lure me right back into that dark place that is so hard to get out of??  Either way, this time I'll be ready.  I will hear what she has to say and this time I will expect nothing. -wink-.  I know where I stand and I wont let her get to me anymore.  Never again. I'm tired of it.

Sure I've changed.  Whether I've gotten weaker or stronger...I dont know.  But there's one thing I've learned and thats to stop letting the past repeat itself.  I'm content where I am right now. 

Gimme a break!  I'm growing up.  Let me do what I need to do.


I've found a lot of words lately that make me smile.  And a lot of words that hurt inside.  Before I thought that words were just words.  Now I see that they are there for a reason and maybe I should be forced to use them.

I really need to read a book right now.  It's been weeks.  Ouch.

Seriously.  How to define MY love?

So I thought about it.  Love makes me feel special, like I've accomplished something magnificent.   And everyone else around me also seems happy about it.  It's like a huge emotional celebration.

That's it!


Love is like one big birthday party.  
And all the presents are for you.
Everyone there is optimistic and they smile with congratulations.
You open each gift with eagerness, unwrapping all the paper to find what's lingering underneath it.  
SURPRISES that are similar to the joy you get when you find out about the odd quirks or habits that your love has.
Still, you're happy with each one. ""I've always wanted one of these!""  

And when you think it couldnt get any better...
...They bring out the cake and ice cream.  Which are a lot like cuddles and other mushy stuff.
It's why everyone shows up to parties anyways right? The cake!
The cake seals the deal.  It's when you have officially gained something extraordinary.  
Something that no one else can take away from you.

Whether it be another year of life or the love of it, it's all feels the same to me.

"event","Today was one of those really normal busy days.  Where I have too little time to think about all the things I have to think about.

It slipped my mind to make dinner (which never happens) so we went out to eat.  There were old people everywhere.  All the time my parents were talking about work and what to get so-and-so for Christmas.  I wasn't listening.  Instead, I was looking at all the old people.  Seeing how happy they all were to be there with their friends, eating reasonably priced food and bragging about grandchildren.  A few of them smiled at me.  They made me feel optimistic about when I get that old.

After I was finished eating, I continued to look around the room, laughing at the peculiar ways people eat, knowing that they were probably raised that way.  One of the old men I was observing walked over.  First, I got scared that he was going be angry and tell me about my lack of manners because a few times I didn't look away, even after we made eye contact.  Instead, he picked up a wrapped toothpick and asked me ""Have you received any flowers lately?""  I looked at him afriad to answer.  ""No.  Not lately."" I said, still not sure whether to smile.  He pulled out a funny looking knife and started playing with it and the toothpick, though he was hiding it from view. ""You know, every young girl I ask always tell me the same thing.  Its a shame.  You see, when I was your age, I gave flowers to every girl who looked my way.  I think every woman deserves a flower every once in a while.  It makes 'em glow, you see.  Makes them feel important.""  As he said this he handed my the ""toothpick"".  I smiled so big and I knew my cheeks turned red too.  He whittled me little wooden flower.  Leaves and everything.  ""It's fresh"" he said.  He winked, then walked out the door.  

My parents, knowing nothing about my staring, thought he was just a crazy old man.  But I knew that he and I were thinking the very same thing.  I knew he was a content person.  I could tell by the way he ate and used his hands while talking.  Very slowly, very rhythmic almost like a song that only him and I could hear.  Like a waltz.  He knew about the song inside me, too.  It was everywhere, moving too fast with an inconsistant beat.  It makes my head hurt.  He could tell, I knew, because of my occaisional stirring of my drink or the way I kept my fork and knife in a perfect straight line.  ""Relax"" is what his song said to me.  ""Why hurry?""

When I got up to pay the check.  My mom was joking around with me.  I was being sarcastic and not telling her why the man made me the flower.  She mimed strangling me as we both laughed...but then as she was pulling away, her fingers caught my necklace, breaking the chain and my whale, Stanley, fell to the floor with a clatter.  ""It was a sign"" I thought.  But that's ridiculous. I dont believe in signs.  I let my guard down...and my Stanley got hurt.  My worst fear, if I stop worrying...something will happen.  The paranoia.  Immediately my sparatic song grew louder as I snatched him off the tile and hurried outside with my mom yelling ""Sorry!! I'll fix it!"" behind me.

She doesn't understand.  I'm not upset because she broke it.  I'm upset at myself for letting some little wooden flower making me believe that if I just relax and have a good time that everything will be alright.  That no harm would come to me.

What does that old man know, anyways?



I'm keeping the flower.  Maybe someday it will all make sense."

"event","So...Thanksgiving day.


This year it has been very important for me to shut my mouth and keep all my opinions to myself about the meaning of Thanksgiving.  Of course, seeing as one half of my family already knows the truth about this day, we've decided to interpret the meaning the same as the rest of the country.  Therefore, to make my mother happy, I made it a point to not ruin the day for her as she entertained and cooked for the guests.


Wednesday morning, my mother and I went out for breakfast.  (We do this about once a month since she was never really too good of a mother before and I guess she feels obliged to start trying now.)  She told me how much better she feels now that she's stopped drinking and again telling me how sorry she is for all the problems alcohol abuse caused us.  She told me she loved me and couldn't believe how strong I was to be able to get through everything I had and how she should have listened to me before.  For her, I was strong.  Sure I was still somewhat angry...who wouldn't be?  But I was there for her anyways, unlike she was for me.  It was very soon when I noticed how dramatically she's changed.  She's grown afraid of everything that can control her and she has learned that she is an amazing person and can do anything...only if she truly wanted to. 

So I guess, this year, in favor of a day I dont believe in, I realized I do have things to be thankful for and I just never stopped to notice.  I am thankful for finally having a mother who cares about me and I'm no longer afraid of.  I am thankful that she found the way to happiness without self medication.  She's alot stronger now than I ever thought she would be...and I'm glad she asked for my advice regularly.  It helps me to know that she trusts me too.  She's proud of me know when all I caused her before was disappointment.  I love her, despite what I've said out of anger.  We're in the same boat, her and I.  

I'm also thankful for Alicia who has also given me such great strength.  When my mom was being...difficult...you were always there to tear me out of that bad place inside.  Remember that painting we made in my room together of the planets in space?  We did it that night were I stole the keys from my mom and you had to drive us home.  Well, I never threw it out.  It means too much to me.  I never had a friend like you.  Everyone else would have ran off and never talked to me again.  You've shown me New York and we've had a lot of really crazy times together.  You are the only friend I've ever had that I can be myself around, goofy and loud.  I learned that maybe I'm not too bad of a person and I shouldn't have to pretend I'm someone I'm not all the time.  You've stuck with me even through all that.  I love you, Alicia.  You've helped me become a stronger person because you've never given up on me.  Thank you so much.

Adrian, where would I be without you?  You've opened up something inside me that I didn't know existed.  It's such a powerful feeling that sometimes I get confused by it.  How can someone else make you feel so diffferent?  You've made me smile and laugh painfully hard and actually mean it.  When you talk to me, I feel appreciated.  When you kiss me, I feel alive.  Where there was gray before, there's now pleasant thoughts and hope.  You picked me up off the floor when I least suspected it, when everything else didn't seem to matter. And everyday I wake up I am so thankful that I found you...and that you love me.  Things will get better.  I love you.  Thank you for not seeing me the way everyone else does.  I adore you.  You make everything else seem worthwhile.



And now, thinking about it, I feel quite dumb sitting on my freshly-made bed, alone in the near dark and loudly crying about things like it was my last day on earth.  But I can't help feeling like everyday could be my last.


It's been a good year.  Hey....any year is better than last year.  I should remember that since that has always been the case.  Perhaps every year it would slowly get better, just like my grandmother says.


Unless I get hit by a truck.


Oh, optimism.  Where can I purchase you?

"event","I woke up way too early this morning with very disturbing thoughts.


As I lied there staring at my celing, I wondered how my great-grandmother was doing.  I sort of felt really guilty that I couldn't remember the last time I spoke with her.  I spent the next few hours staring at her painting of gold flowers that she made for me and was very proud of, but I couldn't remember when I received it.  Again, confusion. When I finally got up, dressed and was halfway to class...I realized the guilt riding in my stomach that was so overwhelming and I promised myself to call her as soon as class ended.  When I found a seat in the back, my professor was looking very concerned when he handed me a test.  He asked ""Are you ok? You look like a total wreck.  Up late studying? Haha""  I didn't answer but I sort of smiled and took my exam.  When I finished early, I hurried outside and searched through my phone list, looking for her number.

I checked each name carefully and it wasn't on there.  Something scared me and I got a bit hysterical.  There was something missing.  The number was missing.  I swore as I looked harder telling myself that I might have just overlooked it.  It wasn't.  I made my way to a bench by the art building.  There was definitely something important that I was missing, I felt it so strong.  I was about to call my mother and ask if she had the number with her.


Thats when I realized that my greatgrandmother has been dead for almost two years...and it was Christmas Eve when I went to her house and was given the painting when they read from her Will. 

How the hell was I to forget something so devastating to me?  It seems like I've been forgetting alot of things like that, lately.  It's scary.  Peggy told me once that it's just that I'm so busy with other thoughts that alot of information gets pushed aside and I don't remember how to get it back.

This isn't anything new to me.  I've always had this problem.   But forgetting about my grandma...that sort of pushed the eerie feeling back into my life.  I must have sat there for a half hour silently crying, trying to decide if there was anyone I could call.  For a while I wasn't even sure if I was awake.  It seemed too ridiculous to happen anywhere else than in a dream.


Just then a girl, Tina, walked out of my class and handed me a cigarette.  At first, I wanted to say no since I havent touched the things in months and I was doing really well at kicking the habit, but my actions didn't agree. I lit it gratefully...and sort of laughed at myself.  It was my grandma's death that actually started me smoking two years ago.

It's just funny how things work like that.






Oh the coincidences.

Tina's roommate died on friday from a drug overdose.   We talked for a while before we went our separate ways. Today has been horribly full of death.  Ronna, I'm very sorry for your loss, as well."

One thing, joined together going wherever, whenever we please.

No one around us to slow us down.

I painted us as a comet shooting all alone in vast blackness.

Blindly running without a care in the world where we'd end up.

We, the ball of light and energy, happy circling existence.

No one to get in our way or divert our path.

We will get there one day.  

Wherever it is we are going...

We are a unique rock waiting for our chance to fly.

I love you.

You are my fire.  

You are what keeps me headed straight on.



We are an awful lot like a comet.

I'm disgusted by all the lies surrounding them.

I'm furious about all the time that's been wasted on them.   Not to mention tears.


What is so fucking great about drugs?  Nothing.
They mean absolutely nothing to me.  Sure, many would argue.  But you aren't me.

They crushed all my hopes, slaughtered my courage and stripped away my self esteem.  I feel nothing but anger now and I'm a sucker to believe if I stopped that it would all just go away.



I'm completely lost for words right now.  First the first time in my life I can actually say I'm speechless and mean it.

Fuck 'em.  And fuck 'em even more for me to not be able to go one day without hearing about them.

I can't get away from them...even in happiness.  You keep bringing them back.  Fuck.  Please stop it.

I'm so unbelievebly pissed off right now.  Fuck you.

I, so far, have managed to turn it into both.  A wreckless case of smart-assitis?  Maybe.  Or it could just be a cover for me having to pull out all my hair.


Anyways...I've been in an extremely giggly mood.  Not happy.  No way. But I have learned a way to trigger funny memories to ease my stress while the terms ""final"" and ""exam"" are used in the same sentence.   Oh boy..

Besides that...
Today, I was my professor's worst nightmare.

We had to give an oral report about ""successful"" relationships and give an example using the classifieds in the newspaper.   We were to weed out what could be ""successful"" or what qualities are missing from what people are searching for.

Now, my views of ""successful"" aren't the same as everyone elses so i decided to be a smart ass and make my point clear.

I found the perfect ad. in some other strange but silly newspaper from pennsylvania


it said..
""I am a 40 year old male with good morals and I have yet to be married.  I've proposed to over 25 women and they have all said 'no'.  I know that my dream woman is out there and I am determined to find her.  My demands for a woman are: She must be a virgin.  She must only cook meals from scratch.  She must not drink, smoke, or do drugs.  She must have five kids when we are married. I will pick her friends and I must be in charge of all of the spending...etc""


now...This dude is ovbiously insane right?  Wrong.

The class exploded into yells and objections as I read his list of ""demands""  they yelled stuff like ""FROM SCRATCH? WHO THE FUCK DOES HE THINK HE IS??""  .. ""A VIRGIN!?! HA!! YOU CAN'T EVEN FIND THEM IN HIGH SCHOOL!!"" ...  ""FIVE KIDS!?!""  Even the guys seemed unsettled by his plea.

I just smiled and asked why they were all upset..

They're answers:
""People don't do that.""
""He's crazy to find a chick like that.""
""He has to be amish or something...either that or something is wrong with that guy""

He WAS amish.

They just fell into their own trap.  Society is different...""success"" is different for everyone.  In that culture it happened to be okay for all that.  It's what they knew and believed worked. 

My teacher nearly peed her pants when i told her that he was, in fact, amish.

I got an A.


....For being a smart ass.


Yay me. Yay the amish."

Kids grow up, graduate, lose friends, and they rarely get as many new ones.  Everyone tells me about these things, sure, and I know the truth behind it.


I really dont like to complain about things but there should be a limit to how many tears you shed for some of them.


One second you're totally happy and ignorant thinking about people you totally care about and think have got your back but when you look theres no one left.  Hey, what did I do wrong?  It's like highschool all over again, except (if it's possible) I'm even more uncool (yay sci-fi and drama club).


Even though I'm done with school, life still seems to be one big popularity contest.

What it turned out to be is my childhood bronchitis acting up again.  This bronchitis is no ordinary kind.  It's the asthmatic kind.  In the past 24 hours I've had three asthma attacks.  One occured this morning in one of my classes.  I bolted to my car in search of an inhaler only to find it empty...surprise #2.  It was my last one. 

I called my doctor, wheezing and dizzy.  Haha..Surprise. He's on vacation for two weeks.  His replacement who has NO idea of my past records wants me in there at 11:30.  Which means...Fail my next class's test or breathe?? Damnit.  Predicament.  He said to go to the emergency room if it gets out of hand again.  I asked him ""Couldn't you just call in for a new inhaler so I can go pick it up?"" and he said ""Well your chart says you actually dont even HAVE asthma so I have to check you out.""


What the fuck.


I'll show him asthma.  I sound like that wheezing demon-possessed chick from the exorcist and he's like ""I dont think it's asthma""


Dude. I've had it my whole life and I think I have more of an idea how my body works, thanks.  Just give me the fucking inhaler!


Frustration.

I sound really creepy though...maybe I should leave some creepy wheezy messages on people's answering machines.  That would be awesome."

This is my body.  It goes everywhere with me.  In fact, it takes me there. I know where it's been, what it likes, and what hurts it.  Sometimes, like this morning, I notice things.  Little things.  Maybe it's because I never really pay attention to myself anymore.  My dressing routine has been hurried.  But it seems like forever since I saw myself.  How long has it been since I've been mentally away from this pile of skin and bones?  Confusion.

What I saw in the mirror this morning startled me.  My Tattoos seem to have shrunk about 1/4 in size.   I have bruises all over me, but I'm not sure how they got in these hard to reach places.  New freckles and dots are scattered all over my arms and legs.  My arms look almost cartoon-like and twiggy.  My breasts...actually fit in my shirts now.  When I got dressed, I realized the predicament of all this oversized clothing and to top it off, all my belts are misplaced due to me not needing them.

Since when have I lost all this weight? How come I didnt realize it until this morning? All the oversized pants? It's like my brain is off-duty.

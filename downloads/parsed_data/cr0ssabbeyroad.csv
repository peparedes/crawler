"event","prom was fun. you spend a lot of money for not that much of a difference of semi formal. i liked it though. i went with my best friends which made me happy. we all went back to courts after and then went to the playground in the morning after eating everything we possibly could. went to see TGE and to dairy queen with kristin, got a ticket going to church (rediculously 114 dollars), and now im grounded for 2 weeks, so if you call my cellphone and i dont answer thats why. and now tom jump is ignoring me (which secretly i am content with) cause hes really mature like that, the only thing hes said to me is ""you disgust me."" lordy do i love that man! so yesterday i was supposed to be grounded but lucy and courtney came over. im not complaining. im pretty bored at the moment and its raining, which is no fun. i have nothing to say, im probably the worst live journaler ever lol."

"event","so this is my second livejournal in the history of my life. i deleted the other one, and i decided to make this one for 2 reasons:
1)im bored, and
2)theyre not cool anymore, so im gonna make one!

i like easter. alot. its probably my favorite holiday, but i like christmas too, theyre both pretty glorious if you ask me. today i went to church and then to work for like 2 hours cause we closed early, Carlos (mmmm) asked me out on a date IN SPANISH! this intimidated me and made my boss laugh hysterically. i said no, but i gave him my number and now im scared. alot. then tony surprised me with chocolates and whatnot in a basket outside my car at work...pleasant compared to a previous saran rap incident. and now i am anticipating my familia coming over for some GLORIOUS food. another reason why i like easter.

yesterday i had a pretty nice day. i got out of work early cause my boss was being extra nice! and then lauren and mark came over, we walked to chips cause it was glorious out and got some food, he bought a guitar, got me a free cd, it was nice. then we met up with courtney and madison, went to the beautiful clinton beach, swang on the swings and whatnot. saw nico! i miss that kid. me and mark went and saw Thank You For Smoking, it was very comical, i liked it. then we went to dennys, nico included, got some french toast, it was orgasmic. 

and im going to stop rambling for now."

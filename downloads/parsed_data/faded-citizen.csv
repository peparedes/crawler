My good friend Kelsie told me this. Apparently, her mom told her this when she was younger. Gee, I wish my mother had told me that. But, hey!...that's what TV is for, right? You can turn on the channel and pretty much see that there are a lot of crazies in the world. No, seriously...I do wish someone did tell me that. That's like...the best thing you could ever say to your kid. Because it's hard truth. 

With that being said...I still have more to add to the whole ""Ex"" situation. No matter where you go...there is always someone going through heart break. Hell...in this day and age, we have social network sites that help keep the ""Down and out"" lovers ranting and raving about their past love lives. That's what Twitter and Facebook are good for. But, in my last, VERY long, entry...I admitted why I resorted back to LJ. My reason (just in case you didn't read my last, VERY long, entry) is because LJ isn't amongst the popular social networks sites of today. Yeah, sure...LJ was the tits back during the MySpace days but, Twitter and FB are the ""in"" crowd. And LJ...is not. I mean, I see some people are down with the old fashion and still post every day on LJ but,...LJ is pretty much non-existent. If you were to go up to a 15 year old and ask them if they have a LJ, they would most probably look at you the same way if you asked them ""Have you ever heard of the artist 'Coolio' or the show 'Martin'"" or something. Anyways,...heartbreak hotels are set up around every corner these days. And people can now ""tweet"" and ""update"" their little (broken) hearts out. It's depressing. And because of sites like that,...you have an audience. And, let's admit it...there are somethings that you should not say in front of an audience. Sometimes, people don't need to know your business. I mean, the majority of the people who ""follow"" me on Twitter are my friends but,...ranting and raving about how badly my last relationship went down in flames is a miserable to witness I'm sure. I've had friends do the same exact thing. You log onto your account everyday and see your friend bitching and moaning about it. Yeah, everyone should express themselves but,...sometimes you have to find other ways to do so. Obviously, I did it too when my relationship ended. I got on my Twitter and trashed talked my Ex or spilled my heart out. In my defense, it was because she was rubbing her new found love in my face and trash talking me. I didn't have to look at her account but, honestly it is EXTREMELY hard not to. I mean, you were once in a relationship with that person. You could talk about EVERYTHING and ANYTHING with that person and then...you break up. You have no connection except seeing a public profile of theirs on a social networking site. Of course you want to know what is going on with them and what they are up to! Or, if they think about you or whatever. It is pretty much a lame excuse. I'm more mature than her and I shouldn't have let her push my buttons but,...at one point in time...I cared about what she said. I cared about her opinion. I just wanted to have some contact with her. I did try and maintain a friendship with her when it ended but, her skeletons came out of the closet and that made it extremely impossible to do so.

Anyways...back to the whole crazy people thing. Ok, so...I believe my last GF was a Sociopath. For those that don't know what a Sociopath is,...a Sociopath is someone who is completely incapable of showing guilt, remorse or shame. Sociopaths are also self-centered and ""use and abuse"" other people in order to get what he/she wants. Now, I'm not saying this out of spite. I know, most people trash talk their Ex's. If they were hurt by their Ex, one feels compelled to trash talk the shit out of their Ex. Now, yes...I was hurt. I was stabbed repeatedly by my Ex but,...I am being dead serious. I DO believe my Ex is a Sociopath. She has and continues to show signs of one.

I basically had to connect the dots towards the end. She cheated on me...she had been seeing someone for over a month before we broke up. But, at the time, that wasn't why we broke up. She made me believe that we weren't going anywhere. But, after we broke up...she made me believe we were working on things. That there was a chance to salvage the relationship. That's when I started to do some digging and found out about the other girl. This girl had no idea that I still existed. I remember the night I called her and told her that I found out about the other girl. I remember crying my eyes out. I was angry and hurt. The conversation lasted about 15 minutes of me saying things that I shouldn't have said, expressing my love for her and crying. NOT ONCE DID SHE CRY! She was just quite...as if she had put herself on mute or something. That's when I knew there was something wrong with her. Who seriously just doesn't say anything when their Ex catches them in a web of lies, is pouring their heart out to them and asking them to admit the truth? Sociopaths. She NEVER showed any sign of shame or regret. She didn't even apologize! The only thing she said was that she didn't care how I found out all of the information and that she ""loves me but, is no longer IN love with me."" The only thing she seemed to care about was getting to the other girl before me. She knew that I was going to tell the other girl what I had found out. I mean...for fuck sake! She became the other woman too when my Ex and I got intimate one last time. Again...I had NO idea that there had been someone else. That was during the time she had me believing we were going to start up again. When I told the new girl about the situation...this dumb bitch said ""Well, I can see why she didn't tell me. If I had sex with my Ex...I wouldn't tell my current girlfriend."" That's when it became apparent...that the girl she was now seeing is a certified dumb ass. Really?! How retarded could you be? I did notice a few things about this current GF of hers (or should I now say Fiancee...yeah, I'll get into that another time) is that...she has low self esteem. I mean, I do too but,...I have gotten better at loving myself. Having low self-esteem is a bitch and it holds you back from being yourself. This chick has made it evident that she is because she says ridiculous things on her Twitter account. She says that she ""doesn't deserve her (the Ex)"" and that ""she never would have thought she would find someone so beautiful"". ""If someone had told her that she would find someone SO gorgeous...she wouldn't have believed them""...she says -.- . ALL she goes on about is how fine my Ex looks. This new girl just sees her as a trophy. She never thought she would find someone so ""hot"" and ""sexy""...that's why she lets her get away with murder. That's why she went and put a ring on it lol smh. It's sad but, Sociopathic people TARGET PEOPLE WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM! I don't believe my self-esteem was as low as this girls though. I mean, I was also smart enough to find things out. I always told my Ex that it would be in her best bet to NEVER lie to me because, when I get an itch...I really do scratch that bitch. I WILL find some shit out. 

Anyways...I do think she is a Sociopath. And the sad thing about it is...it is untreatable. I mean, I do want to care for my Ex because...during our time together...she was NEVER like this! She has COMPLETELY changed. Maybe I did bring out some good in her. I don't know if she was like this before we met but,...I can tell you she wasn't like this when we were together. Those that know her have told me that she has changed drastically. Some have even admitted that she was way more stable when we were together than she is now. I don't know if this is in fact because of the new relationship or what. I mean, some drama did go down at the beginning of the year between her and her mother but,...I wouldn't have thought it would have went like this smh. I think it's all a cry for help. I just want her to be better and to do better for herself. I would hate to hear that she is an actual Sociopath but,...there really are signs of it smh."

"event","It's been a long time. What a win for me for remembering my username and password!

I started this account when I was 16 or...it might have been 17? Not too sure. Anyways, I am now 24 years old. Things have changed over the past 7 or 8 years as you can imagine.

Well...what other way to celebrate this special occasion then to start off with a fresh post about...a recent break up? Really...it's not a recent break up. It actually went down almost 4 months ago. Yeah,...trust me...I know. 

This was my first REAL relationship but, it wasn't my first heartbreak (sure feels like it though). The relationship only lasted a year and some change. This may sound stupid but, I actually thought that this was it. I know, I just said it was my first real relationship but, I actually thought I had hit a homerun. I loved that girl and I'm pretty sure there wasn't anything I wouldn't have done for her. Of course, we both had issues on our parts but, I understood that comes along with the package. I may not have been experienced in the relationship department before then but, I completely understood that. There was a lot of communication issues towards the end. However, it took a lot of convincing that it WASN'T my fault it ended. You see, she cheated on me. The person she cheated on me with made sure that I knew she had cheated on me. When she told me, it was like my heart was ripped out of my chest along with all of my other organs. It was a bloody mess. How she went about doing it was completely bizarre that it made my head spin. During that time, we were going on 9 months of being together. I had planned a trip for us but, things ended up getting cancelled at the last minute. Miraculously, my Ex ended up coming up with another alternative on the fly. Her previous college was having a Homecoming the same weekend of the cancelled trip. Her old college was located in the mountains and she said that her friends that still attend the university would be more than happy to accomodate us. I had never been to the mountains and I thought it was a great idea because I'd get to experience my first time there with her and she could catch up with her friends. Little did I know...

The trip ended up backfiring in my face...horribly. The whole thing was a set up. During the past 9 months of our relationship, she introduced me to just about all of her friends that still attended this university. BUT, I happened to be introduced to someone new during that trip. This someone ended up being the girl she eventually cheated on me with. What was really painful was that, it was orchestrated so well by my Ex...right in front of my face. I knew something was up the moment she introduced me to the girl. For example, the girl looked completely shocked when we were introduced. She looked at me like I was some sort of alien that crash landed on her face. During the dance after the Homecoming game, I had noticed that the girl became very distant from the group. I was sitting next to her in a booth that overlooked the dance floor. I was talking with a few of my Ex's friends while she reunited with her friends. I'm not that great of a dancer so, I just chilled out and relaxed and let her have fun. The girl was sitting right next to me. She looked as if she had something to say but, she was holding back. My Ex was making it her business during that moment to constantly ask her if she was comfortable and having a good time. I was curious as to why she was so concerned about this girl. I mean, she wasn't her best friend after all. At one point, the girl got up and left leaving an awkward silence between my Ex and I. Scratching her head, my Ex asked ""I wonder what her problem is?"" I replied ""I think I have a good idea."" Confused, my Ex looked at me and asked me to voice my opinion on the matter. I stated that the girl was evidentially feeling some type of way towards her but, can't get over the fact that she was taken. My Ex reassured me that that wasn't the case. A few moments later, my eyes scan the room and I then notice that the girl had returned. This time, she decides to make it evident that she is in fact crying for attention by distancing herself even more from the group. She sits on a couch situated in one of the darkest corners of the dancehall. The light from her cellphone bounces off of her now, noticeably irritated facial expression. I just brushed it off and didn't see her as a concern. After all, I knew that there was no way my Ex would have noticed her sitting back there. She was too busy dancing and chatting with her friends. Man,.....was I wrong. A few moments later, I lost track of my Ex. She was no longer with her friends. I looked back, over to the corner of the room where the other girl was sitting. There she was. Talking to this girl. I was so confused. Why on earth was she SO concerned about this girl?! I tried playing it off telling myself that I was overreacting. I look away for a split second and POOF!...they are both gone. Now, I am on high alert. I raise up from my seat and start scanning the dancefloor. After a few moments of searching, there is a break in the crowd. I see my Ex and the girl. The girl is leaning against a bar as my Ex is air humping the shit out of her. I immediately get up and make my way to her. I tap her on the shoulder and motion for her to come talk to me. I knew that she could tell I was extremely pissed by my facial expression. I asked her what the hell she was doing. She played dumb and acted as if I didn't know what I was talking about. I told her not to play dumb. I had just voiced my opinion about that girl to her. I knew she was up to no good. If the roles were reversed and my Ex had told me that she feels like old girl was up to something, she would have told me to not even think about looking her way. But, since the roles weren't reversed...she acted like she didn't understand and that it wasn't that big of a deal. Then she starts to cry and tells me that she didn't mean to hurt me and blah, blah, blah. I fall for it...hard. I feel like a complete dick and tell her that it was my fault. I shouldn't have completely overreacted like that and that all I wanted was for her to have fun. I tell her that I just don't want her dancing with that girl anymore. I then decide that I should leave and go back to her friends dorm room because I acted like such a buzz kill. Stupid mistake on my part for leaving her there with her friends. I should have stayed but, in my defense, that just goes to show how much I TRUSTED her to do the right thing. Instead, that moment I left...that was the moment it was all about to start. 

I found out two weeks later that she had cheated on me. The stupid girl she cheated on me with told me through Facebook smh. I felt like I was back in High School again. Funny I should say that though because, I never had any type of shit like this happen to me while I was in High School. It just seems very immature to me how that was played out. What also hurt was, during those two weeks...there were moments when my Ex and I hung out and she would answer the phone whenever that girl called. Meanwhile, I was still COMPLETELY unaware of what took place those weeks ago. We would be watching a movie and the girl would call her phone. She would stop the movie to carry on a conversation with her. One day, I took the phone and threw it across the room. Of course we got into it after that. A week later my Ex then tells me that the girl wrote some stupidness on her Wall claiming that she will one day be her girlfriend. I didn't see this post but, my Ex told me that she spoke with the girl and then deleted and blocked her on Facebook. I'm guessing that's when the girl had a melt down and realized that my Ex had played with her emotions. That's when she decided to take matters into her own hands and tell me about what happened. When I found out, I was crushed. I didn't want to believe this was my girlfriend she was talking about. SO many emotions were runnin' through me...anger, sadness, frustration...everything. I felt betrayed. I felt like someone hit me in the stomach with a baseball bat. I did not want to believe it. I broke up with my Ex immediately. Of course, I did say a lot of things out of anger. Like...""I wish I never met you!"" and ""This relationship was a complete waste of my time!""...you know...the usual. Of course, at the time...I would calm down and then beat myself up for even saying things like that. But, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY! Something my Ex never seemed to understand. 

We did try again about a month later. I've never really given out second chances to those who have hurt me. I've always just cut the cord but,...I loved her. I truly did. I wanted to spend every minute with her...even after all of that. I wanted SO badly to make it work. But, it all came crashing down again two months later. Her mother (who is also a lesbian) was separating from her partner of almost 12 years. At first, my Ex was telling me things about her mom's relationship. She would tell me that her partner wasn't treating her right and that her mom just wanted to be on her own. Well, that didn't turn out to be entirely true. You see...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. It seems that my Ex learned most of her deceitful ways from none other than her mother. Her mother had been cheating on her partner for about 8/9 months. Well, that's what her Ex-partner seems to think. It was all adding up towards the end. She wasn't trying to live on her own...she was planning on reuniting with her old flame from many years ago. She was cheating on her with the old flame that lived in Texas. I should have known from the get go that it was nothing but a lie. Whenever my Ex would talk about the situation with me, the story would be so fucked up. She would lose track of what she said. That's how you know when someone is lying because they can't keep up with their own story worth shit. Anyways, it got messy when her mothers Ex-partner found out about the other woman. My Ex's mother wasn't planning on telling her partner until it was ""right"" for her. I'm sorry, since when is it ok for someone to cheat and call the shots? Well, she found out and when the cat was loose out of the bag...she got her things and moved to Texas with her new woman. I make it sound like the whole process was a walk in the park but,...I assure you that it wasn't. AT ALL. I expressed to my Ex at the time that I was nervous because, I didn't want our relationship to end like theirs. Look,...I am a 24 year old lesbian. I never had another lesbian couple to look up to before. I kinda looked up to their relationship together because they had been together for so long. I also thought that...since her mother was moving three or four states away...it was going to hinder our relationship because I knew how close she was with her mom. My Ex assured me that it wouldn't and that everything was fine. Here comes another blow to the head...

I find out two days before my birthday that she had herself listed in a relationship with her ""friend"". I didn't know this because, after we broke up the first time...we never added each other back on Facebook. We just stayed connected through Twitter. I found that out by looking through her iPod Touch and clicking on the app. When I confronted her, she acted like it was a joke. She said to me that her and her friend were just ""playing around""...that it wasn't real. Then she flipped it back to an earlier discussion we were having about perhaps we should take a break. We did discuss this two weeks prior. We talked about the possibility of taking a break because we had a lot of things to accomplish. She was still in school...I was trying to go back. I was thinking about moving out of state to pursue my career...she had to stay in state because she doesn't graduate from school until next year. But, having had that discussion...we agreed that we were still gonna hang on. That if we truly loved each other...we were going to get through whatever obstacles. At least...that's what I thought. 

She left me for that girl. They had been in a relationship about three weeks before I found out. Turns out she told everyone else that her and I were done months ago. She even told her mother that. On my birthday, two days later...she kept texting me...wishing me a happy birthday. I was crushed. I hated her for doing that because it made me sad. I remembered sharing my birthday with her the previous year. I was so happy because I never had anyone to celebrate my birthday with before. I was even more happy because my birthday is three days before Valentines Day and I actually had a Valentine. Not just any Valentie...I had her. Now, I was alone for my birthday. All I wanted was to be with her on that day...and she couldn't even be there. I didn't really tell my friends about all of what was going on so,...that made it harder for me. I didn't have anyone to talk to. I was just so exhausted from crying my eyes out...and my mind was everywhere. I did tell my sister the next night about the situation. She hated the fact that I didn't say anything to her. I finally told her because I was having dark thoughts about ending my life. I had fallen into a depression. Probably the biggest I have ever faced. I remember I called my Ex and texted her SO many times that night. I just wanted to hear her voice and tell her that I loved her and wanted her to come back. She was in visting the other girl in the neighboring state. I later saw emails where she was messaging this girl and even made arrangements to meet her for dinner on Valentines Day.

I am an open book. I tell you what is on my mind. That's just who I am but, I do think it works against me at times. Sometimes it's hard for me to shut the hell up because I have so many thoughts and opinions. She always wanted me to partake in the ""Guessing Game"". You know...the game where you have to guess what your significant others problems is and how it had to be fixed? She was pretty good for that. As you can imagine, me being open about my problems and her not being open at all made things difficult. Eventually, she decided to wander away instead of helping me improve our relationship. I have never had the desire to cheat on someone. If it's that damn bad...then just say it is and leave. Why do you need the drama? Yes, we had talks about possibly ending our relationship but, we were always quick to squash it. I always saw that as a good thing because, I thought that showed that we were in it to win it. But, unfortunately...she lead me on one last time. She said things she obviously didn't mean and ended it. It was a messy break up thanks to Twitter. We fired shots at each other for months. Our profiles would be private, then public, then private and so on. She would say things on her Twitter about me...basically trying to bring me down. Of course, I would fire things back but, everything I said was the truth. The only thing she had her mind set was to really bring me down. And yes, I do have low self esteem and she knew that. So, you can imagine some of the things she was saying. She was making me out to be a loser and a joke. And on top of that...this new girl was taking shots at me too. Now, I didn't care what she was saying but, I did care what my Ex was saying. Because, I still had feelings for her. You can't just turn them off like that. Fortunately for her in this situation...she could. I took everything she said to heart because at one point in time, I shared everything about myself with her. I trusted her. She was my best friend. 

It still hurts to this day (obviously). I hate social networking sites because it seems to add salt to the wound. Social networking sites are just there for users to vent. That's the only purpose they serve. That and for people to brag about certain things. I mean, I'm not gonna act like I'm not guilty of this because I AM. But, at least I can honestly say...that's what social networking sites have come down to. That's why I have resorted to LJ again. No one hardly uses it. I don't have an audience. And plus, the whole thing has already been WAY out of hand between my Ex and I. I just want her to go away and stop rubbing things in my face about her new relationship. It hurts. I just can't explain it anymore than that...it...just...hurts.

I all actually...everything I wrote was just HALF of what really went down but, look how long this entry is! lol. I guess, if someone reads it and cares enough to know the WHOLE story then...they'll message me lol. But, seriously...I did want to remain friends with her but, that was before I found out about this secret relationship. I thought I would be better after 4 months but, it still stings. I hate it. I could have dealt without that life lesson but, it's apart of life."

"event","i started up a new blog on another site about two months ago. as i was going to log into that account and blog, i reminded myself of LJ. 

two years. damn. LJ was before ""MySpace"" and Facebook. even having accounts on both of those sites, i preferred to still blog on here for i'm madly in love of my privacy. and let's face it, you'll get a lot of privacy on LJ than any other site. why?? because i doubt anyone still uses LJ or even remembers their username. even though i forgot my password, i still remembered my username to get back on this bitch. so once again, i'm here.

so, after logging in, the first thing i did was read that last couple of entries i blogged about those two years ago. how badly i want to delete the majority of them but, they are memorable. some of them i couldn't even stomach to finish reading...i just went on and on and fucking on. and that was another thing too...my ability to use the word ""fuck"" in almost every fucking sentence. fuck!

anyways...i'm glad that i remembered i had an account on here. and i'm glad i got to read a little about myself from a couple of years ago. i now see myself in a completely different light. a young adult, with real problems...no high school or college drama. i look back at some of those entries and laugh at myself. if only i knew how easy it was then. if only.

to do a quick re-cap...here goes the events of the past two years:

- graduated college in the summer of '08.
- was going to leave for CA but, ended up staying in NC.
- got screwed over by my two roommates in Charlotte, forcing me to move back to Fayetteville. i hated myself.
- been working in Fayetteville for a year now with Apple.
- leaving for Seattle in January to earn my Bachelor's in Digital Film.

so, yeah...that's it in summary. only in summary. the past two years have not been the best but, i have made it this far and each passing day is a reminder that i still have some damage to do. i've got so many ideas for the future that once again, i don't know where to start but, i am so looking forward to my move to Seattle. i believe that will definitely point me in the direction i need to go. i know i'm only 21 but, i feel like i've wasted time. have strong ambition and have set up difficult tasks for myself but, i wouldn't have it any other way. i am so ready to get the momentum going and for good this time.

i have been thinking about someone i lost two years ago too. i am reminded of her every time i look at my HS yearbook and read the note she wrote. her words inspire me, more than she even thought they would when she wrote them down. i miss her deeply and often wonder what our conversations would be like if she were still her. such a good friend. 

well, anyways...that's all i'm going to say. i'm off. i have work in the A.M."

"event","It seems airwaves are being blocked. Somethings going on and I'm not sure I'm liking it thus far. I am so tired of things getting in the way of my personal life. My friendships...my relationships. I always said...and I believe in it deeply...that there is an easy way in life. We as humans fuck it up for ourselves though. We always manage to make things harder than they should be. We create chaos and create disorder and do nothing about it to make it any better. It's like a bully beating a kids ass, apologizing, and then squeezing lemon juice in their wounds. We are fags...

I hate how we are human. Sorry, let me rephrase that...I hate how there are smart humans...decent thinking humans...and then dumbasses. No in betweens there...just flat out dumbass mother fuckers. And no matter what...it's always the fucking idots who are put into some kind of authority. And when they are in that position, they make fucked up decisions for not only everyone else but, themselves. Oh, but, they don't know that they are harming themselves. No...they believe they are absolutely right...no matter fuckin' what. And as they sit on their fuckin' tower...they brain wash those that follow behind them...causing a plague of stupidty worldwide. Fucking up their chance for their own future. Fuck them...and their mothers...

Anyways...back to what I wanted to talk about. Yes, I do think everyone's on mute. I'm trying to think of what life would be like if things like school...work...and no play...really would be like. I find myself rarely talking to my friends...and it's not on purpose. I am busy...and busy leads up to tired. And I know it's the same story for them as well. But, what I hate the most is having those moments when one of them grill you because they got one of those 'grace' periods...where they can finally sit on their ass and not do a damn thing and finally pick up the phone and call someone. And just when they get your voicemail...they flip the fuck out on you. Completely forgetting that just because they have a 'grace' period...doesn't mean that everyone else does. That happened to me earlier this week when I finally got the chance to call one of my friends that recently called me over the weekend. They acted all childish and shit claiming that they had kept calling me and they didn't get a call. That shit...right there...pisses me the fuck off. When I can look at my phone and see that you only called...once. And you try to make situations...worse...by saying you called me all this time...when you never did. Right there is an example of what I was talking about before. It's okay to tell me you've been busy...I have been busy to evidentally. Don't make matters...worse...by saying you did something you didn't...

Another thing that just had to come up today was the constant guilt I have had on my shoulder. Last month...a friend of mine was accused of having someone else do their work behind their back. Granted, the two people who started the accusations are good people when you look past all of the knicks and knacks. Everyone has them. I'm sure someone I know or have met has come across certain things they wouldn't like about me. Anyways, they started feeding me stories about how the work wasn't that persons and eventually, I feel into it. I started thinking that this friend did do this. I just kept telling myself that...yeah, I am pissed...not only for the fact that I knew that it really wasn't necessary for them to do such a thing if they did...but, also for the fact that I and everyone else are busting our asses over this...why can't you. But, at the end of the day...if I had known it only to be a rumor then...I kept saying that it was only on themselves. If they wanted to dig that far a whole for themselves with this...then they need to know what they up against when someone wants to actually see how they did their work. Whatever...it was going to be on them...not me. So, ever since then...one of the two people has constantly been holding this grudge against this person. Still believing that they are nothing more than they dirt they step on. That's not right. That is a personal issue that needs to be kept outside of the professional environment. Anyways...I'm just tired of hearing things said about this person...because, their my friend. Now, the person who's been saying this...I see him more as a colleague than a friend. Nothing personal...their a good person and all but, there's a difference in many ways. So, I just go to the point when I just said fuck it...I'm going to tell my friend that this is what was said...why there was this tense feeling whenever they were around each other...and what I believed...and that was that they cheated. But, come to find out...that person didn't. I faced my fear that they could have easily walked away and confronted them. It felt good because...now they know. I think it is extremely unncessary for remarks to be made of an issure that happened a while ago to be brought up in a professional environment. Anyways...he's going to deal with it on his own time...even though, I advised not to. I think it's not completely necessary to let them know that you. Let them think your this thing your not...then you have a good reason to show them that you really aren't. But, whatever...it's in their hands now. I've said what I've had to say. I'm just curious as to how those two will take it. Will they act all high school about it or will they act mature?? To make accusations is serious...and I rarely do it. I should have known better. I find both of them good people...in their own way...but, stuff like that shouldn't have been said at such a crucial moment..."

it's crazy...it feels like the other day i just came off of spring break and started up my 4th quarter. and what's all the more crazy is that today marks a years since i graduated high school...

i guess it would be more overwhelming if i just sat back and reminded myself of that factor if i hadn't accomplished anything...but, i have...

life right now...it's completely indescribable...it's just perfect right now. everything is where i want it/and need it to be. school and work is going great. filming is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me. i swear...if it wasn't for filming...i would be completely insane. the dvd for the philmont filming is in the mail as i type. by monday...they'll see what i and the rest of red light production team (well...primarily just me and mike chant right now) have done. oh, yes...and red light is getting in the works. mike is working on his own production as well as i am...but, he helped me design the logp for red light. it was awesome. pat is going to make a website for the leading production and i will send in my design to him next quarter for the website design for red light. god this is WAY to exciting. i really can understand something though...was this suppose to be happening so soon?? i mean...i feel as if it should have taken me longer to get to this point...but, no...

it may seem like i'm bragging...but, for the past couple of months...hell, i'm pretty sure longer than that...i've been wondering when was i ever to get a break. and now, i sort of am...

"event","that i still remember to sign on here and write about what's happening in my life from time to time. even though i keep a journal with me everywhere i go now and write all that i can until my hand cramps up...oh, well...i don't have it with me now...

i'm down in fayetteville for mother's day. not really excited to be here but, when am i ever? the only thing i was really looking forward to seeing was my mom because she's the only one that can stabalize what's left of my sanity. i have been EXTREMELY busy with work and school. i've been so busy that i often forget what i have to do the next day or the day after. i want to get a planner...but, i know it will be useless because i'll be too busy to write shit down in it. i run around the city of charlotte everyday...filming bands. that's the only part i love about being busy. i have meet so many awesome bands and been to they're concerts...not to mention getting free stuff...and i'm having a blast. the other day i freaked out because the band i've been working with since december...philmont...was on the radio the other day. i wanted to tell them how huge they are getting and that i'm fucking grateful that they are letting me experience their success with them. then, what made it all the more crazy was that right after the radio station played their song...my friend daniel who is a drummer for this waking moment had a song that followed. i was...""wow...this shit is exciting"". this is what i've always wanted. i wanted to tour with bands and film them at their best...and worst. i want to capture the lives of musicians. i plan on finising the editing for the interview come the end of next week. i can't wait for these guys to see it...

but, i have been busy!! when i'm not filming...i'm working. when i'm not working...i'm filming. my body feels mentally and physically exhausted at this point...but, i know that all of this hard work is going to seriously pay off for me soon. the only thing i hate about it is that i find myself not having the time to pick up the phone anymore. or even like...right now...i finally made time to get on the internet and write all of this stuff down before i had to get up and do something else. but, it sucks when i miss a call from a friend...and i always get those voicemails stating ""i haven't talked to you in a while""...last week...it made me angry, yet sad, when a friend of mine was like...""your the most difficult person to get a hold of. when you feel like putting me on your busy schedule...please let me know""...that sucked. but, i'm sorry. i care about my friends more than anything but, i would at least think they could understand that i'm a little bit more focused on me right now. i'm making sure that i'm not wasting my time in college and i that i will get to do what i plan on doing...

life has been hitting me hard ever since i started college. shit...even before that. maybe getting into that car accident the day before graduation was a sign?? but, yeah...a lot of shit has been going down. and i am quite surprised at this point that i haven't managed to become mentally insane. i don't know how the hell i do it...but, i do. i think the only person that can understand at this point of what it is like to try and focus on what you are here for...is nicci. she moved out thursday and withdrew from the school. her parents don't help her out down here and she just got a job as a front end manager at kohls. she said that she's basically going to take the summer off and work and then she'll be back. i love that girl. the ""friendship"" that her and i are in maybe confusing once you look at it...but, then you realize it is not. she said to me that i'd be upset with her before i guessed she was moving out to live with her aunt 20-mins away. i just said that i'm not stupid and i saw it coming. and since i love you...i'm going to tell you something that somebody who loves you should say...""if this is what you have to do...then do it."" i'm behind her 100%. i think we both  understand that to be together...we must first put our own wants and needs...first. she completely understands me when i say that it is ridiculous when someone puts another persons wants and needs above theirs. it's completely ridiculous. when i came here...when nicci came here...we didn't plan on coming to college and finding someone. we came here to focus on what we want to do when we get out of here. so, i'm pretty sure that come october when she transfers back in...everything will be where we want it to be...

well, on another note...when i came down to fayetteville this weekend...i knew it was going to be more about business...then pleasure. for the longest time...it has irritated me how my mom pays for my car insurance and phone bill. basically, draining me of MY responsibilities. i'm 19...by this time next year...20 and graduated. are you seriously going to think that i'm going to rely on her for everthing? before i came to college...i was independent as hell. i did not rely on my mom to fund my needs. but, since enrolling in this college...i had to face life depending on a relative of mine for financial issues. i don't like that. i don't like the fact that i am getting more help from someone else when i want to experieince the true hardships of life. the only bill i have ever paid was the cable bill...and that's it. well, for the past month...i have been trying to tell my mom that i want to be cut off...financially. that i have a job now and that i need to take care of the majority of my resposibilities. she told me that she understands...but, she doesn't want me to worry about all of that because i should be focused on school. true...but, i don't like depending on people...even if they are family. when i get to where i want to be...i want to say ""yeah, i did it on my own""...so, i talked to her today about moving out of student housing apartments and getting my own place. nicci and i were looking for homes to rent a few weeks ago...but, since she moved out...we probably won't be moving in together for at least 2-3 months. which is perfect because we both get our $450 deposits back and we'd both have banked quite alot of money from our jobs. i was sweating bullets cause i do understand that she wants me to do well in school without having to worry about when's my next paycheck going to come in so i can pay my rent or bills...but, she said she doesn't understand why i just can't stay where i'm at but, if this is what i want to do...then do it...

so, hopefully by july i will have banked a lot of money...and found a place. charlotte is an excellent place and it is way more cheaper to move into a rented home than an apartment. thus far i have found 3 bedroom homes for $600-$800 with utilities included. that right there was nicci and i's plan once her cousin moved back down here earlier this month. i don't want to rush into things. the last thing i want is to run into something by taking it a hold at warp speed. i do like to think thing through before i do it..."

"event","i've been starting off brand new...

i've only encountered one minor problem since the beginning of this quarter...and surprisingly, it's not nicci...

my roomate allyson and her bf matt are getting exhausting to the point of no return. thus far, she really hasn't been back to the apartment...so, i've been having the room to myself but, i have to admit...since she moved in at the end of february...i gotten to know a bit of what she's about. but, whenever matt gets in the picture...she puts him over everything else. there's nothing about here in that relationship what so ever. he talks to her like crap...she doesn't go to class because he constantly calls her...and she thinks about his problems more than her own. that is fuckin' ridiculous. you'd have to be a golden goddess in order to make me act like that. there is no way in hell that i would forget the true reason as to why i'm in college and what it is that i want to do with my life once i graduate. there is no way in hell someone should treat someone else's life better than your own. but, i told her once she first met me...because she bestowed a lot on me by saying she knows that i would be a good friend to her and that i would never screw her over...and i told her that i have never had the intention of screwing anyone over in my life...and if i have a problem with you, i'm not going to beat around the bush and not tell you. instead, i will tell you like it is. but, i did tell her that i would like to form that kind of friendship with her but, if she were to come to me for advice...i would tell her what i would do if i were in that position...and it's pretty evident that you haven't taken the advice you wanted from me...then i don't want to listen to your problem anymore. and her problem is breaking up with matt and i told her last night that if you haven't done it by now...after all of our talks and god knows talks with everyone...then your not gonna do it and anything else i have to say is just a waste of time...

so, that's the only problem. i just don't want to go through shit with her and her bf cause i'm not in their relationship...i've got my own worries...

other than that, everything has been going smooth. i've become part of the xchange for the imd program which is our own show and i'll be interviewing bands and such as my own segment. i'll shooting a music video with the band orange jumpsuit come next month. i got a job yesterday and arsley cinema's which i know will be an easy job cause i work mostly during the weekdays at night and no one hardly goes to the movies then. i've asked my mom to sign over the title to my car so i can sell it and hopefully get a celica...that would be sweet. and nicci and i?? well, we've worked out a lot...to the point her, stephen, her cousin and i will be looking for homes to rent by the end of this quarter. so, now it's all about keeping up with school and money and hopefully by the end of this quarter everything i'm wanting and needing will be set..."

"event","only a month and some change has passed since i've written on here...so, let's re-cap the events that have happened since then...


1. sade, the roomate i lived with for five months, true colors start to show...she kept on talking shit behind her so called ""friend's"" backs.
2. that ""strange roomate"" that was never there the majority of the time my 2nd quarter...has a name...""nicci"" who, after the first week of knowing her name...became my girlfriend.
3. the night i asked nicci out...sade decided to become the attention whore i thought her out to be...had alcohol...and slit her wrists.
4. the day after running countless red lights through the city of charlotte with nicci and sade's passed out ass in the back of my car...i went off on sade for being incosiderate and selfish for performing such a stunt that could have gotten me, nicci, and sade herself kicked out of school...
5. nicci and i broke up...somewhere amongst the madness of the next week...
6. my english teacher...mr. merrell...starts grading like a cunt.
7. i get my mid term grad back for english and merrell wrote me down for an f...because he's a cunt...
8. my car got broken into...nothing stolen...which they might as well have...
9. nicci and i continue a relationship...even though we don't acknowledge a relationship...
10. nicci wants to make sure of her sexuality and confirms to me that maybe she should hang out with a guy to see if she really is gay...
11. a week later...i cuss out nicci in the student parking lot...completely unaware that people saw me cuss her out...that wasn't cute...
12. the next day...nicci and i make out in her bathroom and she confesses her feelings for me...which reminded me when she took me out to denny's @ 2 in the morning and confessed her feelings then...
13. two days later...nicci and this boy whore micheal start talking...
14. two days later...i sleep in allyson's bed because she wanted me to be in there with nicci...only to wake up the next morning with my heart in my throat when i saw micheal was in her bed...
15. matt...allyson's bf helps me get over nicci...
16. matt...a cool guy and everything...makes himself home @ the apartment...even though he's not suppose to be there...
17. matt...has been at the apartment for almost two weeks...i and the other roomates start to get uncomfortable for people are starting to notice him being around the apartment all the time...
18. heterosexual love in the bed across from me started to make me violently sick...
19. after a week of going out...micheal dumped nicci claiming that ""she didn't make him as happy as his last girlfriend""...i laughed maliciously.
20. nicci starts telling me that i was right about micheal...and that she would get hurt. i let her know that she is only feeding to my karma and that i am happy that the hurt she left on me, back fired on her...
21. i drop nicci off to the airport because she left to go to NY for spring break...she leaves me with an awkward hug.
22. saturday...i came down to fayetteville because matt was still at the apartment and i didn't want to be there when some shit went down.
23. went over to aaron's and hung out at the movies.
24. next day i leave for raleigh with aaron. aaron got into it with his gf rosa which i found ironic because it seemed like we have been living the same love life.
25. nicci calls four times during that night...i chose not to care for the calls.
26. aaron and i hang out all day in raleigh. raleigh is okay...but, no where as great as charlotte.
27. aaron and i start to reminsce and talk about people from high school...one of them being kelsie who i stopped talking to a good couple of months ago.
28. the next morning, aaron wakes me so we can get on the road...and ironically, kelsie leaves me text messages talking about ""how dare i not talk to her for this long"" and that ""i better not be ignoring her""...
29. i call kelsie and we both appologize to each other. 
30. nicci calls...i answer...and she tells me how she is having a shitty time with her family...i could really care less...

a lot has happened this year...and it's almost the fourth month. all i know is that i can honestly say that i've gotten my fill on things...and all i'm asking for is a break. so, when i go back up for my fourth quarter, i...in no way...want to re-live this shit. whatever happens between nicci...i'm just gonna let that go. this past quarter has offered me a lot of insight on a lot of things. i never experienced any of these things...but, i can honestly say i have now...

god, i just wish things could have worked out with that girl and i. she's gorgeous, funny, and everything i kept looking for. it was so ironic aaron was going through the same shit. how he confessed that he is clingy with his girlfriend because he cannot see himself with anyone else. well, i can see half of what he's saying...but, you cannot say that that girls the one when you haven't really been with a lot of people. i'm not saying you have to put yourself out there like a whore to find your cup of coffee...but, i understand where he's coming from. you meet someone who puts your mind in a rut...who gets your emotions in a bind...and you don't know what to do for once. and that can be very overwhelming...especially for people like me...who keeps themselves in control...and then when you meet that person and you don't know what to do...you really don't know what to do. i don't know, in a way...i want things to work out...i want her to realize that i was once in the position of doing anything for her and once in the postion of learning to love her. even though she admits that she hurt me and that i should know how she feels about me...i'm gonna need more than my view as to how she see's me...i'm gonna need hers. and then...in a way, i tell myself i deserve better...

who knows?? who ever knows...who ever has a control over this situation...sure as hell knows how to hurt one's head..."

"event","i came down for the weekend for my b-day. everything went smooth...this b-day was really simple and i finally got the cake that i wanted...so, 'tis awesome...

ummm...yeah, but what has been going on in my world since the last time i wrote on here...

well...really nothing but school and work. i recieved this project assignment for my advanced image manipulation class...the assignment was to re-create an american dollar bill with another historical face. once the assignment was given...i knew that the most popular choice was going to be martin luther king, jr...and i have no problem with that...he has every reason to be on american currency. i mean, i wanted to choose him...but, i knew a lot of people would choose him and to me that's very origional. then i considered JFK and knew that many would choose him as well. then, i started to think outside the box. i wanted to do someone in this day and age. someone who is really fighting for a cause during our time. but, i knew that that was going to be a challenge...because, no one stands up for anything anymore. there hasn't been a person in this country that has done something for a good cause or invented anything that has benefited this country. so, without any doubt whether this was a good choice or not...because i strongly believe it is...i chose Bono from U2. of course he's not american...he's irish...but, this man is doing everything in his power to help out with the AIDS cause and so on and so forth. his music is inspiring and almost everyday he literally harasses president bush about how more money needs to go to better causes then to war. to me...that man in more american than any american soul in this country. when i chose him...i knew that it was an excellent choice and i knew my professors would love the fact that i chose someone born from another coutnry to be on the next dollar bills. well, they loved the idea...but, i was in shock to see that they didn't see more to it. the first thing one of my professors said was that ""he's not american"". i looked at him and said ""but, he's more american than any american man/woman of today."" i told him my reasons as to why i chose him...there aren't enough people now a days standing up for a good cause except for musicians...and when you look at it...they're not even american musicians...their european. chris martin of coldplay for example...he stands up for make trade fair and helps out with the poverty in other countries. name on american who has done that over the years??...

so, now i'm searching for influential/historical americans to do my project on...and i don't want to choose someone who accomplised something over a century ago...because everyone knows them and their work has already been apprecited. but, i'm most likely going to stick with my original decision...and for the fact that it creates some controversy...i like that. i think now a days...out decisions should create some kind of controversy because your obviously standing up for your beliefs...instead of standing up and then quickly sitting down...

god...we need more revolutionaries..."

"event","up until the 24th day of this year so far...i said to myself ""man, how fast it's happening...and how challenging it's become...""

i've put my fun aside...and i've put my ambitions ahead. i see nothing but success from here on out...and achievement. fuck the bull shit. i'm driven to be the best mother fucker to walk up out of AI with a BA...and throwing it in their faces. yes...of course this sounds cocky...but, i wouldn't be cocky if i wasn't stating truth...

thus far...i've been experiencing many things. ideas...exhaustion...and love. what a combo. i do admit...sometimes i'm afraid i'm way in over my head...but, as long as i keep my stability...the possibilities are endless...

i guess the reason why i may fear the ability of letting it get in over my head is because...while trying to juggle my goals and ambitions...i found her. i never thought love and ambition can work on the same level...but, thus far...it is...even though...we don't really know it...well, i have an idea...i don't think she's comin' around lol...

but, despite the shit we've already been through during those crazy 24 days...we both are trying to accomplish what we want to do with our lives...and i also think we're reaching a comfortable understanding of each other's wants and needs...and more importantly...goals. but, i think for now...taking it slow is better than any old good idea. but, i have a feeling...that everything will sort itself into place for the time being...

so, hopefully this year will bring a lot to me...so far...i've been going through things pretty fast...


oh, yeah...i deleted that pesky myspace...it's one less stress. but, i'm probably going to have another account set up come march. not for me...but, for the production team i'm starting called RED LIGHT PRODUCTIONS. i know this is goin' to be one of the best things that will ever happen to me this year...this production team will do nothing but produce music videos...with directors such as mike and myself. i have strict confidence that this will be one of the best things set up in AI other than the Review...which isn't doing too good on it's part. so...just wait for it..."

x-mas eve...woke up around two p.m...and went around adrienne's later. adrienne and i both got each other two gifts. yesterday, we just opened one. i got her the new (+44) cd...which is an awesome cd i might add...and she got me an iDog. when i got home...and i did was play with that damn thing. later...i called mike to see what he was doin' and he said he was in springlake. once he got home...i went to pick him up and we chilled @ my house until x-mas morn. i gave him his gift...dropped him off home...and then opened the majority of my gifts around 1 a.m. after that...i knocked out unntil almost the afternoon...

i really want 2007 to be the year i get my work out there. i'm goin' to try and get in contact with the oil factory inc in CA to see my stuff. i want to already be in my career...i can't stand waiting around anymore...i want my work out there already..."

"event","thursday rolled around and i jam packed my car. i couldn't wait for my night class...which was a first...so that i could show the class my web site and then go home cause that's all we had to do. class started at 6 and i left around 6:40. after leaving, i went to go pick up that chick asia nesmith. she goes there for fashion and marketing. i wasn't really up to carpooling to be honest with you. i much more like it when i travel alone and blast my music all the way dow 485. but, she was asleep for the majority of the ride...and seeing as i make that three and a half hour trip, two and a half...didn't make it seem that bad...

anyways...i got in town around 9:00. i dropped asia off home and then went home myself. the next day...i went to pick up mike from the seventy-first. it was strange...seeing all the cars parked out there in the senior parking lot and realizing that just a year ago...my car was parked out there because i attended that school. well anyways...i called mike and he was like...you should come inside and hang out with me but, they were on some gay ass code yellow lock down and they wouldn't even let anyone get inside of the school. so, mike ended up comin' out the door. it was sort of funny...as i waited for him...reggie harris and marvin gainey were there and i asked them why they were their...and they said they didn't know. why would you just go up to your old high school for no apparent reason??...

after picking up mike...we went straight to adrienne's and she made us some white chocolate covered pretzels. those shits were good ^0^. we then hung out and watched a few movies...then mike was like...""you know what?? we should go to secrets..."" so, after leavin' adrienne's...i ran a few errands and then we went to secrets. we had a good time and what not...but, when we got back...we were completely floored...

we woke up around 2:00 in the afternoon the next day...thanks to my mom. i'm sure if she hadn't awakened us...we would have slept the whole day away. anyways...we went to the mall and i got adrienne's belated birthday gift seein' as i again forgot her b-day gift in charlotte. we then went around here's to drop it off and then we went back to my house. no doubt that mike is officially a hostage at my house now. we just got back from pickin' up some more of his clothes from his house...

it sort of sucks...well, not sort of...i does. i remember when mike told me how he was going into the army because he said that there was nothin' else he could do with his life. and i remember how i reacted...completely crushed. i told him that the army just wasn't the way to go...and if he wanted to be in the military that he should go for the air force. at least once your in the air force your not seen as a ticket stub that gets pulled out of a hat and then forced to another country. but, he did it anyways...and then i thought to myself...that's his decision. well...now, it's really depressing seeing a friend go through this. he hates it...plain and simple. he tells me how his life has changed drastically and his opinions towards many things have changed. he tells me how the guys in the army aren't there for the right reasons...and how they got themselves all geared up to go to iraq...that by the time they found out that they were goin' so soon...they feel like backin' out. to me...that held no surprise. he can tell that he is physically and mentally drained. he despises the men that are there...and to think...he's been living with their hypocrisy and bullshit for months now...only to return to that hell in a couple of weeks...

well, now that we're both home...we're just goin' to relax and not stress the little things..."

"event","we checked out the camera and all of that good stuff at the cage on thursday...

ever since then...that camera hasn't left my shoulder. we got up early saturday...to face the cold and empty student parking lot to start filming. we were out there for almost five hours filming...it was great. we were having so much fun...even though we came across a few fuck ups here and there. we didn't get everything we needed so...we just headed back to my apartment to chill. after mike, jake, and giann left...stephen and i went to see philmont perform at tremont music hall. that would be my first time...definetly not my last...there. stephen and i were kind of getting a little bummed that philmont wasn't there yet...even though it was like...7:20 and they said to be there before the crowd starts to come in...but, they were coming in around that time anyways. so, stephen and i waited by the door...and the dude leaned over and asked me how did i know philmont and should we be on the list...once i said through myspace...a dude standing right next to him was like...""hey!! i'm scott from philmont!!""...fuckin' myspace...thanks...

as soon as we walked in the mid of the hall...stephen kept threating people that he was going to knock them out with the boom mic cause he was pretty sure they were lookin' at his hollister shirt. i laughed and just told him we were better then these scene kids...we got a mic and a camera...and we're with the band...

so, scott was able to get us a back room...just me, stepehen...the band and the cam. when we walked in the back...that's when i thought to myself...""oh, shit!! i forgot the questions i was gonna ask them and what if i fuck up??!!??""...but, as soon as stephen started the cam...the questions just rolled off of my tounge. the whole time i kept askin' myselft...would the interview be at least 5min.??...and really...it turned out to be just that...

the band was so awesome...scott, josiah, and abe are really awesome guys...and i can't wait to get back after break to start the documentary on them and hear their stuff. right now, i'm probably gonna stay up all night editing this stuff on my computer...

after that...stephen was kicked on gettin that marvel ultimate alliance game...so, he literally sped all the way offa i-85 to the game stop where he lived. the whole time doing this...he's telling me the car accidents he's been in and the tickets he's gotten so far. so, i'm on the phone with mike v. and mike it like...""wtf?!?"" and as soon as i told him to slow it down...we saw blue lights flashing in the rear window...mike and i were like...""how ironic...""...

yeah...i had to add that last tid bit in there...but, stepehen's doin' alright...he's just gotta explain to his parents that he may have to sell his car come next year <_<..."

"event","today...i woke up around eleven o'clock...

we ate around two...and i devoured everything on my plate ^0^...

i told myself two weeks ago...that there was no point in going shopping for all the usual stuff seeing as i'm going to come back home for thanksgiving...so, i only got the essentials (i.e...milk, bread, cereal, tp...and some ramen noodles). needless to say...i had been living on ramen and oatmeal the entire fuckin' time!!...

when i got in on tuesday...i walked right in through the door...opened the refrigerator...and picked up anything that was edible without having to heat it up in the microwave or prepare. my mom looked @ me completely stunned. not only did i make a three hour drive cut short into a two hour and 25-min. one...but, the fact that i looked slim. thats when she passed a brownie my way and i completely emptied the milk jug. grocery shopping was never my thing...not only am i a cheap ass...but, i tend to grab things that don't even require cooking. like, microwavable things...which, is not good. i need to start cooking stuff...good food. so, i don't think that getting on the ""essentials"" plan...was a good plan...

so, yeah...i've been completely impatient with the last couple of days leading up to my release. i kind of needed a break. from the whole moving thing...to working...to doin' projects...non-stop. it wasn't really setteling with me. so, i was looking forward to actually coming back to fayetteville and getting some much needed r&r. when tuesday rolled around...i packed up my shit...went to both of my classes...and left around 2 o'clock. when i hit 495...i considered myself gone. the drive was a bitch...i actually prefer to drive @ night like i did the last time because i was literally the only car out there for a good 80 miles or so. and considering the fact that it was on a thursday night. but, yeah...i didn't like this drive. it was raining dreadfully hard...and the fuckers out there acted like they didn't have any common sense @ driving. i would get impatient...honk my horn violently...roll down my window to cuss them out through the pouring rain...and then speed off...hydroplaining the whole way home...

when i got home...i tried to relax from the drive...but, my mom had a million favors waiting for me. @ around 8...shannon and kayloni came over. we talked for a bit...and then she went home. after that...i completely knocked out...

after i ate with my mom and sis...i went straight to aaron's because i forgot that he was leaving today because he had to go back to work on black friday. that sort of sucks because we had made plans last week...i guess it all of a sudden just came up. we cont. to play guitar hero II...playing songs we didn't get to play the previous day. that game is so fuckin' awesome...that's on my x-mas list...lol. fuck!! i might as well buy it for myself seeing as i do work @ gamestop. so, yeah...as we were playing...shannon called. and right then i was like...""oh, fuck!! what is shannon doing today?!?!"" i mean...yeah, what a question right?? i mean, a complete smart ass would say ""duh!! it's thanksgiving and she's spending time with her family"". no...this thanksgiving is different...because this is the first without her mom. when i picked up the phone...she told me she was on myspace talking to mike. she said that he was @ his house with his mom. as soon as i heard that...i left aaron's and picked her up...

when i got to her house...it was just shannon. and it made me sad...her dad had left for baltimore a couple of hours earlier...to lay flowers on her mom's grave and to visit family. shannon decided not to go...therefore...she spent her thanksgiving alone @ home. i immediately grabbed her and said that we were going to see mike. when we made out way across town...i felt completely happy. i realized then and there that we haven't been the three of us in six long months. when mike opened the door...shannon and i didn't know what to say. we all just hugged and hung out. i felt so whole right then. just the three of us. and when i think about it...it always has been just the three of us...and probably always will. it's kind of funny...i remember when i first introduced shannon to mike...and she developed a short little crush on him...which wore off because she then thought he was annoying...lol. now...that's way passed. we can all get a way with annoying each other...lol...

it sucked...leaving him. but, he said that he will be back @ his house tomorrow for a short time...i hope we can all hang out then...

after that...we went to brittany's. i haven't seen here since july...she's been @ western uni. there i ate greens and mac & cheese. after leaving britts...shannon and i went to pick up zack. i dropped them off @ shannon's and went to go see kelsie. kelsie was in a ""feel good"" mood. when i went there...they had beer and all. i just drank a corona...i thought it would have been best just to drink one seeing that i have been beating off the fuckin' niggeritis like a mother fucker. kelsie was upset because everyone thought that she was drunk...even though she supposedly had a wine and beer to drink. i mean, she is a small girl...and she was acting like it. but, she was just in the feel good moment...when you think you are...so, you have to act like it. so, i dropped her off back @ her house a little while later...

...after that...i met up with shannon @ kay's house...and completely devoured her ham...lol. that shit was good ^0^...

and then...i drove home. my mom and sis just left to go out...i wish i had went out...but, no one was really doin' anything anymore. shannon promised that we'd all go to secrets tomorrow...awesome. i just got off the phone with scott. i told that fool that he should have come down here with me. he's basically doin' the same thing that i'm doin' now. we started playin' dumbass games...like, who wants to be a millionaire...which led up to smarts questions. he then tried to convince me to steal a nintendo wii for him...and i told him that his chances are slim to nothing. a couple of days ago...i saw him perform with his band ""restless oblivion"". it's a heavy metal band...which, i think it's safe to say...scott doesn't quite suite the appearance...but, he's still a kick ass guitarist...lol. but, yeah...i guess after the show...they got a little crazy...which led him to a tattoo/piercing parlor where he then got an ""anti-eyebrow"". it was funny...when i saw him later...it looked like somone had smacked the shit out of him. lol...but, the piercing looks cool...

well, i'm out...the Itis is getting to me now..."

i won an ipod nano for only $65 on ebay...I LOVE YOU EBAY!!...

it's a 2GB which holds up to 500 songs. i love that thing...i haven't let it out of my sight since i got it. i feel like thats been my ONLY high light this past week. there hasn't been much of anything goin' on in my world...i've just been anticipating going back home. yeah...who would have ever thought...fayetteville. the only reason i can't wait is because  want to hang out with shannon, adrienne, and the lot. i finally talked to aaron for the first time in two months!! he called...i think last thursday. nothin' much has been goin' on with him either. he kept saying that once we get back down there next week...we definetly should go to secrets. no lie...i seriously want to go back to secrets. freakin' denisha ALWAYS calls saying that she wants to go there when she comes back in december...and every time i talk to her...she makes me want to go there more and more...that's sad...lol...

gamestop tried to get me workin' almost everyday...but, i let them know that their not pullin' that shit on me. if anything i am more concentrated on school. my schedule is so up and down as it is. next quarter...it'll be a bit better because i don't have a class monday ^0^...that' awesome. now, when i get finished with my classes on thur...if i ever want to come home...i'd have a three day weekend instead of the usual two. the only thing i don't like is the fact of having one of my classes online...i heard that's a bitch...with any college. my sister is taking like...two...for Tech. and she said that she fuckin' hates it. oh well,...i'll just talk to the advising lady tomorrow...

i don't work until saturday...and it's only for a few hours...so, i'm good. i can't wait for them to get their inventory back so that the employees can start checkin' out the fuckin' games. man...i can't believe that PS3 is goin' to be $600 for the 60GB one and $500 for the 20GB. i remember reading an article last year when they announced it...and they said that it was going to be the same price the PS2 was when it first came out...which was $300. them fools lost their mother  fuckin' minds!! i won't have one of those bitches in my posession until i'm like...twenty-two or some shit!!...when i said that to this dude name jeff...who is a complete dumbass...and i'm not saying that in a joking kind of way...he seriously is a dumbass...he said it wasn't that much. fuck that!! that's money for a used up hooptie ride if you ain't got a ride. that shit would get you from point A to sometimes point B...

i don't want this week to end...after all...things got a little lighter today which, i think will hold up for a good weeked to come. today...didn't even feel like a november...it felt like a day in september...i literally thought i went two months back...crazy...

well...i started work today...instead of sunday. at first, i did think it was going to be one of those shitty days. two days ago...i was told to start work on a sunday. then, a day ago...told to work saturday...then today...sunday...then later today...today. i said to myself...""oh, yeah...here it comes...the fuckin' run around""...well, i went in...and it was just like it was when i was working at the gamestop before...easy. that job is so fun and simple. i really want to get guitar hero II. every time the store went empty and silent to the point the only thing you could hear was justin and i breathing...i wanted to run to the ps2 and play that fuckin' game...but, i have to act like a professional...lol...

yesterday...jennifer brang her crazy ass over. i haven't talked to her in a good while. she's always busy really...
anyways...we all sort of engaged in an interesting conversation...her, sade, and i. it was like ""two straight girls and a lesbian"". we started talking about the female genitalia and all that other jazz. knee deep in the conversation...jennifer makes a reference of ""an arby's sandwhich"". to be honest with you...i've never had an arby's sandwhich...and i've always wanted to go and just have one...but, not after that conversation...lol...

i had to cut the conversation short...not just because they started talking about the male genitalia...but, because i had to attend my night class. my night class maybe long and shit...but, it's a really mellow class. last night...we made a web page for our sites that we're developing...we're finally using dreamweaver which makes the long, pain enduring process a hell of a lot quicker. stephen wouldn't shut up...and of course he sat himself right next to me. evertime mr. g looked over i was sure he was going to tell us to shut the fuck up (which, no doubt...he will actually tell you to shut the fuck up). but, he saw that stephen was doing all the talking. stephen turns to me and jokingly says ""i'm gay""...and i'm like ""but of course..."" after he and i finish our assignments, we go downstairs to play pool and he turns to me to tell me that he's mad at me. he told me that he was mad that i didn't get offended when he said i was gay. i looked @ him in all sorts of confusement...why was i suppose to be...i am. but, he was like...if i said it to anyone else...they'd get offended. i just laughed. then he starts talking about how the male gene won't exist within the next one hundred years or so. apparently (according to him and james) every male knows this interesting fact. again...i laughed and said...""then the world would truely be run by lesbians""...

the apartment looks like shit. i have my stuff packed up...and sade has her stuff packed up...and we have yet to move. i hope we fuckin' move tomorrow...cause i have work sunday...and i'm not trying to break my back trying to get this shit done. it seems that i'm the only one making any progress with this long overdue process. i'm the only one that's taking the fuckin' initiative to get this done to save my time along with everyone else's...the fucks. oh well...if nothing is done by tomorrow...i'm just gonna let someone else bust their ass to make some sort of progress...

aaron called last night...that would be the first time i spoke to him in almost...two months. we started talking about our classes and everthing. he and i seem to be stuck in the same rut...we both have crushes...and we don't know how to reveal them. that to me...is so fuckin' pussy...i hate crushes...for just that reason. since when do i never tell anyone how i honestly feel about them??...that's not me...nor will it ever be. but, i seriously think that...since some good has come out of this difficult week that it would help if i told the girl. she's so fuckin' cute and her personality is amazing. she's a little older than me...but, has tried and accomplised a lot more than anyone i know that's her age. i don't know...maybe i'll tell her...i just don't know when..."

yeah, i asked myself that yesterday. after goin' for my second interview and finally getting hired at gamestop...my phone starts to act up. so, i go on a full long mission from one cingular to another to find out what was wrong with it. well, come to find out it was only a fucked up signal in the fayetteville number. as soon as i got home, i needed to finish up my web page...but, seeing as we don't have any internet...i couldn't...and i didn't feel like driving to the school so late. that right there was the line for me. after playing cat and mouse for three months to try and get the cable dude out here...he finally comes and says he can't install it because my other roomate had yet to pay her $30 bill. this is all too ironic...seeing as how two months ago...her argument for not adding my other roomate and i on her account was because she was afraid we wouldn't pay our bills. what tripe bullshit. so, we're moving out to the apartment below us with diana. thank god!! this girl is the most disgusting and vile person i have ever encountered in my life. she keeps meat to rot on the counter for two days until finally cooking it. at that point the meat is all discolored and when she cooks it...it smells like an old slaughter house. her trash piles up in the wash room because we confronted her about how it just piles up in the kitchen and how she never takes it out. she's twenty-one and she has the mentality of a five year old. my god!!...what a way of leaving an impression on one's mind...

on top of that...i realized that i have a series of errands to run this week. i want to get all of my stuff moved and packed downstairs by friday...but, those other girls aren't leaving until the afternoon or so...and i wanted to get everything cleared out at wachovia. then...i got a call from my manager...and, instead of starting work on sunday...i might be going in on saturday...the day i wanted to finish up my color theory project and image manipulation project. oh!!...what a dilemma, right??...whatever...i'm sure i'll get through this hassel. it's only life. just when you think you can get one thing done...there's only a million others to fall right behind it. 

...i really wanted to start up the storyboard for the documentary. the guys from philmont are goin' to film some of their own footage while in the studio come the middle of december. then their goin' to leave it in the hands of scott and i. after that...once we get the equipment...we're going to follow them on tour and get enough of what we need...and that's a fresh reminder. i need to get in contact with them because they want us to hear songs from their new album to consider making a music video of one of the songs. i found out today that they'll be playing on stage at treemont on dec. 9th, so...i'm gonna see if i can make it for them...

i want this to all go well...more than anything. but, i know that we're going to need a third hand. i know stephen would want to do this project more than anything...but, now it's gonnna be a little more edgy seeing as we both have jobs. now, it does kind of suck being the manager of a store...you get a lot of hours...but, the pay will come in real handy when i finally buy a camera..."

i've been searching high and low for this movie we watched in media and mass...it's called ""man bites dog""...that movie is excellent. it's a mockumentary about these filmakers filming a documentary about a serial killer named ben. it's french...and i'm starting to love french films. the movie was so provacative and so explicit...i love it. i think i'm gonna go look and see if they have it on ebay...

my color theory project is almost complete and i am so happy with myself that i stuck with my origional design. the things i have been doing ever since i go up here completely amaze me. i do things here i never thought i could/would do...the whole apartment is covered with mine and my roomates work...

i'm currently downloading adobe photoshop to my computer along with dreamweaver. even though in my major...web design is like a minor for me...i still want to be able to make sick ass layouts. html coding is easy...and we work on that in my night class in intro. to scripting. we won't be doing designs in there until this week and i can't wait..."

Cross the street from your storefront cemetery
Hear me hailing from inside and realize

I am the conscience clear
In pain or ecstasy
And we were all weaned my dear
Upon the same fatigue

(You're staring at the sun)
Oh my own voice
Cannot save me now
It's just
(standing in the sea)
One more breath
And then
I go down

Your mouth is open wide
The lover is inside
And all the tumults done
Collided with the sign
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
Your body's over me

Note the trees because
The dirt is temporary
More to mine than fact face
Name and monetary

Beat the skins and let the
Loose lips kiss you clean
Quietly pour out like light
Like light, like answering the sun

You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide
You're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck
There's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me

Be what you will
And then throw down your life
Oh it's a damned fine game
And we can play all night

You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide
You're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck
There's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me

You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea"

maurice and scott keep working on songs...but, whenver i go over to scott's...maurice is gone and scott is playing the xbox. i can't really remember what happened after that...i think i made it a complete movie day or something. i rented out a shit load of movies again from the library because i made a list of films i haven't seen and that we've been discussing in my media & mass class. i mainly watched them for the directing techniques and such...

later that night, kevin came over and said he had these pins that got you in for free to this club he goes to. i didn't really want to go...but, then again i did because i wanted to see what this club was like. i'm not really a club fanatic...i'd rather go to house parties or something of the sort. so, it ended up with us taking four cars. i didn't want to drive at all!!...i had three people in my car...and ever since my car accident...i haven't been really comfortable with more that two people in the car. so...i ended up following behind this dodge...which didn't turn on their fuckin indicator once and slammed on his breaks any given moment...and all of this on the fuckin' highway. we finally get there...and it looks like there's no one there <_<...

when we get in...we were basically the only ones there. the club was a hole in the wall. it was basically a hole in the wall lounge...and it was small as hell. kevin tried to sweeten up the situation by saying...""well, it's not really a club. i don't like clubs. it's more of a lounge."" well, soon after sade disappeared with kev and i decided to go on my own to find a more ""suitable"" club. well...i found one...right across the street. it was called the spot. and as soon as i found out it was a alternative rock club and that a band was playing there that night...i called jennifer. jennifer came and we didn't go in...but, we socialized with a few band members and people that she knew. i wanted to go in...i didn't care if it was ten dollars and i was paying for jennifer...i wanted to go. but, i knew that any minuet...the people who rode in my car wanted to leave and go back. i was sort of pissed. i wanted to get the hell out of the apartment complex...and i don't ever recall me being a babysitter. so, i decided to go to this party with jennifer...and i didn't care how the others got home. but, they ended up getting in the back of sade's small ass jeep. i could only imagine...six people in the wrangler..."

maurice, scott, kane, dennis, jennifer, sade...and some other girl named ashley...kind of crashed at the apartment. origionally...it was just suppose to be me, sade, jennifer...and her bf and friend. but, then it just kind of turned out to be a whole different event. but,...it ended up good. when it broke up...me, jennifer, and a couple of other folks go into her car to blast out some music. i love jennifer. i love the people around here. we all listen to different sorts of music and we keep ourselves informed about new artists and people we've never heard of. speaking of which...the whole band documentary works out...maurice definetly wants to work with me...and we're gonna start looking for bands tomorrow. but, we do have scott. scott's a guitarist/bassist for a band based out in rockhill called restless oblivion. i haven't heard from any of their stuff...but, scott took me to their studio. their gonna be playing at a club on nov. 17th. by then we'd already have our equipment and that would be perfect. so...who knows how it goes...

gamestop said that they most likely won't have me working until november...which, i guess plays out good...although i'd probably be there up until christmas. it's still good...i'd get a paycheck or two in my pocket...and the come back to fayetteville for my break. plus, i wouldn't have to be stressing about any projects due and me having to work on top of that. but, i really need a new pair of shoes...it's starting to get too cold to wear chucks and my dvs shoes are fucked!!...lol...i can actually make my dvs shoes talk because the bottom in about to come completely off on one pair. yesterday i showed my teacher and she painted the top red to give it a tounge...some weird dude drew teeth...and sade put eyes on it...what dorks. so,...maybe tomorrow i'll trip over to pacsun and get some vans ^0^..."

today's media and mass communication class was great. we started talking more about our films we are going to make. we're gonna get in groups and write our own screen plays and act them out. we get to use the new cameras...which are fucking awesome i might add. we have a choice of doing any kind of film we want...i really want to find a band in charlotte...which, would be no problem...whose trying to make it in the music industry and make a documentary of them. i also want to throw in a music video at the end of it. already i know whose gonna be in my group. probably no more than four of us. there's this one guy that's been making his own films and has had interships with the industry...he's only 18 or 19!! he's currently working on a project of his own. i know that my friend kane is most likely to be in the group. but, i don't know who might be the fourth. it's kind of a hard decision seeing all of us has had some kind of experience with film before and everyone in the class could benefit one another...

my professor mr.easley sat in our class today...that man is so fuckin' awesome. he offered us a few insights and what not. he knows everything...even if your not in the IMD major...it doesn't matter if your in a fashion major...or interior design...almost every single student in each major prefers to confront him about something than their own professors...

well...i'm gonna get up off of here. i have a lot of ideas for these projects that i need to jot down and i have a class in t-minus sixteen minuets..."

my classes are awesome. i LOVE my media and mass communication class. we go out and watch movies and critique them. we pay attention to how the film was directed and such. during the next week or two...we'll finally start filming our own films...ABOUT TIME!! i know i had to get through with the basics the first quarter...but, i just wanted to film. i want to start making music videos immediatley!!...i want to make a name for IMD here. Ai looks at fashion a little more than all the other majors...and the fashion students are ungrateful as fuck when it comes to that. they get fashion shows and shit...we get to show a couple of student films...but, it's not like we're premiering it to the public as much as the fashion students. my professor mr.easley...is the coolest fuckin' guy you'd EVER meet. he's worked with BET...documentaries...and music videos. he's helping me to get my name out there and has offered me to meet people that he has worked with in video production. i really want to get out there in the city and start filming. charlotte has an awesome music scene...

well...besides from my m&m class being great...i got image munipulation now...where we restore damaged photos...renew and create designs. and then color theory...i have the same teacher i had for fundamentals of design...mrs.casserly. she's fuckin' crazy...i love that teacher. i got one night class a week and that's on thursdays...i can deal...seein' as i got my car up here now. it's better than having a class on friday...i love not having classes on fridays...

my mom decided to come with me. kayloni, leia, and jamal were there too. it was really hard...i couldn't help but cry...

it really hurts to see your best friend going through something like this. the whole time i sat there...i wasn't even paying that much attention to the sermon. instead,...i sat there, watching shannon, her brother shawn, and their dad's reaction. the three of them...sitting there as their mother...his wife...lay in a casket about five feet away from them. i can't even imagine what that feels like...

mrs. natalie was like my second mother. she always befriended everyone she came in contact with and left some lasting impression. i remember two years ago...about three days before christmas...when she came over with shannon with two gifts for me. she gave me two amps...one for my guitar...and one for a mic...only for me to break the guitar amp a few weeks later xD!!...i remember all the times she would say things to shannon and i how she wasn't going to be around that long. all of those times where she would pull me aside and tell me to be there for shannon when she was gone. i always dismissed her sayings as nonsense...merely telling her that she wasn't going any where...and yet,...she's gone now. this is so crazy!! that last time i saw her was three weeks ago...with a smile on her face. and the last thing she was to say to me was that whole ""look after shannon"" and telling me how she wasn't going to live forever...

ever since i met mrs. natalie stigall...she always said i was some sort of trouble. she said she had a feeling ever since i met shannon that i was this sort of wild child waiting to be unleashed because i was so quite when i met her. i don't ever recall me being quite or in any way reserved when i met her...but, hearing her tell me this over and over agiain for the past five years never ceased to amuse me. now...i can no longer hear it. now...i have to just remember it...

today...today, she died. and right now...i'm not there for my best friend shannon. we both stayed in some what silence on the phone. but, we would break the occasional silence by cracking a joke or two. that was always my and shannons best...to laugh ourselves out of troubled times. but, now...i'm no longer laughing. i'm sad. i'm angry. i'm hurt...all of which i know shannon is dealing with a thousand times worse. and, if she hasn't...i know she will. and i want to be there when she does. i want to be there by her side with this...because, after all we've been through...we're like family. mrs. natalie was my second mom. she was kind and good to me. matter of a fact...she was more than that...but, words cannont explain right now...

seeing as my weekends start on thursday...and there's a holiday on monday...that calls for a LONG ass weekend in my view. so, my sister is going to pick me up tomorrow after class. hmmmm...i wonder what i'm going to do in fayette_nam. probably nothing...seein' as there's nothing to do. but, i guess it would be alright to come down again...see where everyone is at and what their up to...

man, i'm surprised that i am not completely drained at this point. it seems like there are a lot of people who have sort of stopped to take a breather...but, not me. college life can be simple...but, the moment you get here...you have to vow to yourself that your gonna stay on top of everything...no matter how complicating and frustrating it may get. for example...in one class we'll have project after project due. once we finish one project and turn it in to be graded...we'll get another that day we turn the old one in. then, we have projects in other classes as well. in every class...your homework is NOTHING but projects. fuck definitions, fuck reading out of the books...we got projects. and it's kind of ironic to my thinking. in high school...i forever hated just...doin' book work. especially in english because i wanted to do projects more than anything...and the only english class that did that was Mrs.C's...i loved that class. and now...i can do that. but, even when i do consider stopping...i don't...because the projects that are given to us are completely astounding. you do things you never even heard of or dreamt of doing. and half way through the project...no matter how complicating it is...you want to finish just to know what it will turn out like. sort of like...the recent project i got in my fundamentals and design class. we had to morph objects into an item and show the stages of the object being developed. while i was listening to ""kids with guns"" by the gorillaz...i got an image if my head of a gun forming together and then blasting off a bullet. i wanted to do that SO badly. so, i had found my determination. i was determined to make what i saw in my head become reality. and i have to admit...i sometimes have difficulty explaining what i see in my mind. but, throughout the stress...the project was a success...and i can't wait to get it back in my possession..."

How many lives are living strange
Where were you when we were getting high?

Caught beneath the landslide

i tried to stir away from the possibilities of getting a night class or having to have a class on fridays...but, it was a win/lose situation. i'm thankful that i don't have class on fridays...STILL!!...but, i have to have a night class which is Design Layout which is almost a good four hours!!...but, whatever...everything else is fine with me. i only have five classes a week...just three classes one day... and two the next. what more could i ask for??...

and here i thought i would have gotten screwd over some how...but, i have to keep reminding myself that i'm in college...NOT SEVENTY-FIRST HIGH SCHOOL x) !!..."

"event","this week was hella busy. nothing but project...after project...after project...after project...>_<...!! although, i do some how manage to turn them in on time. but, to tell you the truth...even though it can be hectic...i sort of like it. i mean,...the only book i work out of is my quantitive literacy book...and the homework is easy. other than that...in my other classes...we do projects. like drawing rooms in perspective, morphing designs, and doing texture quilts. if you give yourself enough time...you'll amaze yourself with the outcome of the project. one minuet you'll be like...""what the hell!! i'm not creative enough to do this sort of shit!!""...but, then...it changes on you like you wouldn't believe...

i took my midterms last week. i did good on all of them except for my typography...i only missed three and i got a 79. but, i'm still passing with a B. my drawing and perspective class is starting to be a pain in my ass. one week we'll be focusing on a project thats due...then the next we'll be doing something else...completely making you forget the project. then, the next week your back on task with the project...introduced to something new...only to be told to forget about the project for now...that's bullshit...but, i'm surviving the madness...

i have to go to a class tomorrow...ON A FRIDAY!!...because i skipped it on tuesday because i needed to go shopping. oh, well...it's only for about an hour or so...

i hope i can get a job soon...i don't want to wait until oct. in the second quarter to get one. i mean...shit can get boring sometimes...and i think a job would help me out a lot with that...but, i'll just have to wait and see what i can do..."

"event","candise is cool...but, hanging out with people who are younger than you...doensn't seem so logical now. when i look at it...i was like, the youngest in crowds...that was alright with me. but, now...when i go to candises' for the weekends...whenever...i find that i'm the chaperson...she doesn't have  license...so, i have to be in the passenger seat...that's bullshit...i don't want to have the responsibility of another. so, for now on...i'm not gonna go to her house on the weekends for some time until she gets her fuckin' license. i'm not a damn babysitter...and i sure as hell won't be one to someone who just turned eighteen. i mean...so, i'm not that old compared to her...but, her friends is another thing. and they don't do shit...and i feel so out of place. i mean...COME ON!! i'm one to do stupid shit and not give a flyin' fuck who cares. candise will admit that she tries to be ""cool"" and what not. be cool to who...THEM?!?! who gives a  shit...just do you and you'll be alright...

but, whatever...

leia is finally down here. her mom finally left yesterday...and her last words to her were...""leia...be good."" so, leia some how interpreted that as...""okay...so, i'll go across the hall with the graduates and have a little p & j and a lil' vodka...only for a security guard to  come and issue me a ticket for drinking...""...LMAO...i was rollin' when she told me that one. i even told her that if the authorities were to come...haul fuckin' ass...but, she decided to ""think right"" and stay with her roomate...well, i just hope that her mom don't find out. leia was all calm about it and didn't give a shit. all she realy has to do is go to a class for an hour for riks of alocohol or some whit. but, after all of that...we made plans for the upcoming weekend...her roomate it gonna come and pick me up so that she can take me to UNC Charlotte and then go to clubs ^0^...ABOUT FUCKIN' TIME!! i want to hit up them clubs!!...so, yeah...that's on the agenda for next week...

"event","it's so crazy. yesterday, after coming home from class, my roomates candise and lyndsey were standing on the balconey along with so many others watching the ""noobs"" move into their new apartments. it only seems like yesterday that it was us moving in. i mean, shit!!...we've only been here for about 5 1/2 weeks and we have about six weeks left until were no longer first quarter students x)!!. well...anyways...we introduced ourselves to the new people. actually...we were whoring ourselves...constantly yelling across the parking lot from the balcony...""come to apartment 1333 to have a real good time x)...!!""...

we hung out with this new girl who is a culinary arts major. we told her about her roomate who goes by the infamous name ""greenday""...around the campus. that chik just turned 18...and she's been here for about 2 quarters. meaning, she thinks she knows every-fuckin' thing. well, her roomate can't stand her, and neither can her mom. we told her how she tries to run people out of there. she already made two leave because they couldn't stand her fat ass. but, her new roomate said she wasn't gonna put up with shit. plus, if she keeps runnin' roomates out...her ass is gonna end up being fined...

we hung out in the apartment watchin' hostel...i've seen the movie before...but, on bootleg...tell me why the movie was better on bootleg??...i mean, it still sucked ass. so, we had conversations here and there...she's cool. she was tellin' us about her girlfriend...and that's when i obviously knew she was gay. which was shocking...because i couldn't tell. i tell ya'...my gay-dar is always off some how...but, whatever...

today, i leave for candises' house for the weekend...i need to get my stupid typography project out the way to enjoy it..."

"event","shannon said she missed me...which i basically believe she got bored...and came down to charlotte thursday with lisa to come and get me. when she got there...it was pissin' down rain...and i stood out on the sidewalk gettin' drenched tryin' to see if she was coming down the right street or not. once she arrived...we went completely crazy up in the apartment. i invited my friend sade (pronounced Sha_day...boop!!...lol) and we ordered pizza and kept shoutin' out to the roomies across the parking lot. we then settled down when security showed up ( to which i believe kathy...the spinless RA...called because she couldn't stand up and tell us to shut the fuck up). so, after spendin' two hours in the apartment...we left around 10:30. at first...we knew where the fuck we were goin'. lisa knocked out...so, it was just shannon and i just crusin'. then, we missed an exit...ONE EXIT!! that threw us off for a good hour or two. we basically went around in a circle during that time. so, then we finally got on track...gettin' in at 3' in the mornin'. 

the next day...i called adrienne...and she kidnapped me. after pickin' up her pay checks...we then went to the cookout because for the past five weeks...i've been craving a heath-toffee milkshake...and it felt so good having it. after that...i went home to get my car and then went to christina's. we finally got to see each other instead of just talking on the phone all the time. jamal came over before he went to work...and i just knew that her sister purposely called him over there...i just had a feeling she would. so, after catchin' up with him...i went into christina's room. we ended up making out...and her mom kind of caught us. she didn't say much...only that we need to ""tone it down"" or else we would have to go into the living room. all the while i was thinking...""so...what?? you want us to go out into the living room and continue making out??""...yeah, only if. so, we cooled it. we began talking...and then i left. we both think her mom's gonna end up having a few words about the situation...but, whatever...what happens...happens. i just don't get it though...out of all the times we made out...this time would have been the only time where we actually were cautious of our actions so that we wouldn't get caught. it's kind of unbelieveable that they didn't hear us the first time...

so, i then went home again...only to leave over to adrienne's...pick her up and go over to books-a-million to see leia. she just got on the job...and adrienne and i just sat there the whole time eating all the free samples of cake and brownies. leia's all excited that she's gonna be down in charlotte in a few days...and she told me how she ran into KIM SPOLARICH at the omni a few days ago...she told me of the conversation that took place between the two...and whilst hearing it...i had an enormous grin upon my face...supposedly...she was sorry for what had happend at the end of our senior year...and how she had misinterpreted what she heard...and that it was not her business to have gotten in the way. when leia had asked if she still talked to her...all she said was...""NO,...because she didn't even show up at my birthday party...""...and it's crazy. i never let it get to me after that...what was said...was done. but, finding a person like that in my life...seriously makes you want to NEVER AGAIN meet another soul like them again. and coming to find out a few more things about that person...only makes me smile harder to know that i definetly removed an irritating thorn out of my side. so, after catchin' up on that...i took adrienne home...

today...i went shoppin' with my mom and sister...trying to catch up with stuff with my mom...cause i spent last week with my sister when she came up...and we had fun. i've completly noticed a change in my relationship with my mom and i. ever since i graduated...it's like i am being treated with a little more respect...and that she and i can relate more now. after spendin' time with my mom...i went over to kelsie's and hung out until they had her uncle's going away party. her uncle is crazy as hell...but, he speaks mad truth...or maybe it was because of the two beers that i had that made him seem right in just about everything he was saying??...i doubt it...her uncle is like...the fuckin' mesiah...he tells you shit that he thinks and knows you should hear. his advice to me was to...""TAKE IT SLOW""...and i knew what he was  talking about...i didn't even have to tell him anything about what's been going on in my life...because he can tell...

well, it seems that i'm in for the night now...shannon said she wants to leave at around 11' tomorrow so that we could go to southpark mall once we got back to charlotte. man, that mall is exactly a mile long!! and ever since i've been down there...i always wanted to go...so, we'll see..."

"event","she left. then turned around...and went right back again...why??...

i remember having discussions with my sister on how i don't see how hard it is to take responsibility and live up to your own independence. at times, she would agree with my opinions, but...she always said that you have to be in another persons shoes to actually know. i've known that...so, i did agree with her opinion. but, you do question...why is it so hard for others...than yourself?? i remember when i was thirteen and i always said that i wanted to go to a college away from home. i always said i wanted to go to CA or NYU...but, about two years ago...i had to be a little bit realistic. i mean, i'm not saying that...if i were completely motivated to have moved so far away from home...that i wouldn't have had a chance at all...you always have chances...you just have to take them in order to realize it. but, there was money situations...there will be. so, i had to make do with what i had...and that was to stay in nc. but, i knew that there weren't any schools in this state that would offer at least half of what i wanted to do. so, i had to make sure i found a college that lived up to my expectations of becoming what i want to be. and i did...i didn't want to go to any other school and learn what i knew wouldn't benefit me in the long run. and i'm doing that. i may seem like i'm being boastful...but, i have a reason. i've never really been proud of myself for anything. and now i have so many reasons...that it completely baffles me. i'm here right now...making something of myself...and, while in the process...proved so many wrong. especially my father. nothing could compare to the complete satisfaction that i am feeling at this very moment to know...that one of the people that was suppose to support me throughout my life...hasn't...and that i have proven that i could do whatever the fuck i wanted without him. i didn't lose anything great...i gained something great. and that was my self confidence and independence. i am my own now. not one moment here...i haven't felt home sick...or wanting to give up...because...there is not opportunity for that anymore...and if there was...i wouldn't take it. if i was ever caught up in those thoughts...i would simply remind myself that THIS IS WHO I WANT TO BE...THIS IS WHERE I AM...and...THERE'S NO STOPPING ME. why would you want to return back to what seemed like normality??...this is something different...something new. and if you even have an ounce of fear of what you are about to do...doesn't that just add more excitment to it??...

i don't know...people have different intakes and outlooks. what they do...is what they do...but, right now...i'm gonna do  me...

"event","well, my sister came down here on a tues. to spend her b-day with me and we ended up driving around and going to eat out at this chinese place...MMmmmMM!!...i love fuckin' chinese x) ...

but, not everything was all fun and luxury when she came down here...because, we had some shit to attend to. for the past couple of weeks living here...HELL!! it's almost a month come next week...i have seriously enjoyed the whole college experience. but, there's one little thing thats starting to piss me off...a roomate. my other roomie candise is awesome. i couldn't of asked for a better roomate than her...but, then there's the other one. the one that refuses to pick up after herself...leaving garbage...HER!! garbage on the kitchen floor...purposely stacking one bag on top of the other. now, i put my trash can in my and my roomates room...so we can place our trash in it. so, that's how we know it's not ours. but, the other one just keeps piling shit in the kitchen as well as her dishes in the sink. i fuckin' had enough. there's always ONE LITTLE thing that can get in the way of everything good. so, after realizing that we have been doin' our part for cleaning up after ourselves and constantly throwing the trash right in front of the bitches door...only for her to throw it right back in the kitchen...i've had enough. my sister and i spoke with the RA...yet, again...and showed her pictures of the kitchen and the state she leaves it in. needless to say, she wasn't fuckin' pleased. and, she didn't like the fact that that bitch went out shopping for groceries last week and piled her food in the refrigerator to the point it took my sister and i good 20-mins to organize it so i could fit my shit in there...that wasn't cool. so, the RA said that there would be a meeting back at the apartment to sort out the issue. but, did the bitch ass roomate show up??...NO!!. she stayed her bitch ass out. and that's funny. this chik will sigh and stomp her feet...like SHE has a problem. no, bitch...i got the problem. and i let her know about it...but, what gets me is that she plays it off that she's this chik that tells it to your face...but, she turns out to be a pussy. the shameful thing about it is...she's older than us...this is her last quarter...she's been down this road plenty of times...but, she can't fess up to her own fault and speak up. you'd think that now i'm in college...EVERYONE would be stickin to there guns. this is no longer high school anymore...your no longer a teenager or young adult...you are a fuckin' adult...you need to say shit in order for it to get done. but, some are still trapped in that high school mentality...(i.e. my roomate). but, what the hell can i say...if the bitch keeps it up...i'll be moving to the nicer apartments because i've been puttin' up with it for too long. so, either way...i get my point across..."

yep, i have to finish up my typography project which is due wed....i like that class...but, some people thinks that it's boring...it's actally interesting. the only class that i dislike is my drawing and perspective class...she goes extremley fast with measurements...and she mainly tells YOU what to draw...which is bullshit if you ask me. though, you'd think i'd be hating math...but, that's actually a cool class too. i made a 90 on my test today...i only missed two answers...which was great because i thought i was going to miss like...3 xD...

so, while spendin' time at candise's house this past weekend...i found out that my laptop has it's own music video program. i plan on going around the whole campus today, just filming random people and then going home to work on one. that made my weekend :)...

i'm glad she's gonna be here next month...after all, she's only gonna be 20-mins. from me...

so, other than leia...i called jamal's ass too. it seems that nothing has changed there...he's hanging around the same people and doing nothing. he's lucky he has a job...otherwise, he'd be going completely insane at this point. we got to talking how nothing has changed with some of the people we know and how some are managing to get sucked into the black abyss known as fayetteville. sometimes, i want to go down there on a weekend...and try and plan it out...but, i some how feel like i never want to return. what's new??...what's happening??...nothing. so, why bother??...that place is nothing but a melting pot of GI's, strippers, and wal-mart whores. but, i'm glad that some of the people i know are going to be going to college's where they know they will succeed...that's a good thing...

so, i found out a couple of days ago...that we, here can study abroad...that's awesome. you can go to places such as italy, germany, france, and england...hopefully, next year i can go over seas and study...that would be a great experience...

i didn't get to go down to fayette_nam this weekend cause D_wit's hoopty-honda needs some serious work done to it...like you can't tell just by looking @ it...

so, yeah...a couple of people and i walked around the entire apartment complex a good 50-gagillion times xD!!...

most of the time, we'd go to others apartments and play games and shit...but, other than that...we walked...

my friend sha ( i can really spell her name...i lose it after the first three letters) and i messed around in my apartment most of the time...watchin' movies and trying to order food...only for us to decide that we didn't want anything because we didn't know what we wanted to eat...

so, yeah...my sis is coming down on her b-day next week and spending the night here...hopefully, we can drive to that big ass mall and shop our asses off...and maybe the next week i'll come down to fayettville for a few days...meh, i'm still thinking on that one...

although, i am starting to like the fact that i don't go on the net that often...because, just by checkin' up on myspace and on live...it's depressin' reading the shit on there. it seems to me that some of the people i know are still stuck in that drama mentality. in a way, it helps because it reminds me that i've moved on. that i've met other people here who aren't like that...and thats cool. to me, this whole college life thing is one hell of an experience. unlike high school, you won't have to worry about people changing on you. they already know who they are and who they are meant to be. in high school, people had identity crisis...they would fit into a crowd they wanted to belong to...but, had no idea that they stood out. here, we don't have crowds. you stand out individualy and thats what makes it unique. i'm gonna have an awesome time here for the next three years...

i just can't wait for the next quater to start in october so i can finally choose what time i want my classes. we were meant to do that in the beginning...but, we had to go through the basics before we did the other stuff. i have one math class...and that's the only math you'd be taking in this college. no math ever again!! and computer apps. the rest of the time...your drawing...and my typography class is cool as shit. then, next quater i'll be doing what i want to do: making music videos ^o^. my class hours are pretty good now, but...i'd rather have them more in the mornings then gettin' out at 4 in the PM...

anyways...i need to get goin' to my other class..."

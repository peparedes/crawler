I for my part learned a little bit more about myself and will also be happier in time.Call me an optimist."

"event","<p>Sir made it down for Valentine's Day.  The day before Valentine's Day actually.  After a long drive he somehow managed to get onto the 10 S instead of the I-5 S, and managed to pass my house by an hour.  I felt so bad.  He was so tired he almost gave up and checked into a hotel... I managed to get him here in one piece and on Friday around 3 in the morning, we held eachother and passed out almost immediately. </p><p>I've been so insecure, so worried.  The truely terrible thing is we're good together.  I was worried that the distance and the time apart would mean the wonderful time I had in December was a one time deal.  The amazing thing about this was that we were as good together this last weekend as we were in December... it was like we'd never been apart.  I've never had a long distance relationship that could do that.</p><p>So Friday I got up and went downstairs to make him breakfast.  Just simple that time: eggs, toast, bacon, juice.  We watched some television with my mom.  We went upstairs and fucked a little.  Then, finally we borrowed the keys to drive down to Newport Beach.</p><p>My collar has been a secret point of discontent to me.  It wasn't very pretty, but more than that it wasn't very comfortable.  When it got wet it would dye my skin brown, and the last time it was wet it left a large angry welt around my neck.  So we went down to Condom Revolution, mostly because right over ConRev is Wicked Chamber... My Sir picked out the most beautiful collar for me.  It sits in a neat V below my throat.  The silver heart is cradled on a stainless steal backing (I think).  I have at this point have had no allergic reaction to it and I love the way it feels.</p><p>Newport Beach was a short adventure, we went home, and both took a nap.  He was still tired from getting lost the night before.  Later, we hauled ourself out of bed and drove down near campus.  I had promised to take him for Thai food.  I feel bad because I think I I stressed overmuch about the bill... but I'm so broke right now and $40 was more than I was really intending to spend.  Sir mentioned that he was worried about His own budget after Valentine's dinner and I fet even more guilty for worrying so much about my own.</p><p>Sir did pretty well.  He was more comfortable with the Chicken with Chili and Garlic that I ordered at a 5, than he was with the Beef Curry that I ordered at a 7.   I ordered wontons because he wanted them... and because I wanted to make him happy.  I still have a lot of leftovers... I am enjoying them very much.</p><p>Friday night we had our first scene after a long way apart.  I was nervous, and eager.  I was hoping He'd put some of the training positions we'd talked about into practice, but he chose not to (to a bit of disappointment on my part).</p><p>Valentine's Day was magical though.  I made him an omelet, bacon, and lemon crepes.  Sir took me out for a spectacular dinner at Marscapone's, and brought me two stunning red roses.  The scene that night was perfect, I felt... if not challenged, at least controlled.  I think I'm getting better at wax play, but it's still a bit above my pain level sometimes.</p><p>It's always hard to see Sir go, but it was easier this time, because I knew we wouldn't be apart for so long.  He's coming back this week, late tonight actually and we'll get to try it all again.</p><p>I'm still seeking more from Him.  Mostly, I want Him to want more from me.  It's no challenge to sub for a Sir who expects nothing from You.  I asked if He ever worried about my behavior as a sub, He said never, but I wish He would.  I love Him a lot, maybe even more than I've ever loved anyone before.  He certainly treats me better than anyone ever has before.  This coddling though... We have 'til summer to make this work.  Hopefully He will be the Dom I know He's capable to being.  I don't think W/we'll survive otherwise.  This is too much a part of me to ignore it.  It worries me.</p>"

I talked to Him about it, rather than scrapping things.  I'm tired of starting over.</p><p>He promised not to impose a very specific speech restriction on me.  It's not that I'm imposed to speech restrictions in general.  I like the traditional titles ""Yes <i>Sir</i>.""  However we tried a period where I was unable to refer to myself as ""I"" or ""me,"" in 10 minutes time I already felt distinctively awful.</p><p>He's reading through a lot of my old BDSM materials right now.  My old Sir from Modesto (now with a sub of his own) is going to talk to HIm tomorrow afternoon.  Hopefully the scene part of our lives will balance out for the better soon.  I love Him, and I want it to work.</p></font>"

"event","<font color=""#0066CC""><p>The twentieth century is a different type of world.  Instead of meeting in coffee shops or at book clubs, romance starts on the interneet.  That's how it happened with me.</p><p>One night I was browsing my favorite site, mostly to convince myself it wasn't hopeless.  I came across a noteable profile, but normally I wouldn't have messaged Him.  After all, His very username proclaimed Him a sadist and I didn't consider myself a pain slut.</p><p>I didn't realize that that message would change things for me.  Our online courtship was so typical (excepting His unusual politeness) that I really wasn't expecting much.  He came down for my twenty-first birthday.  He stayed in my room because honestly I found him unthreatening.  It was His intelligence that had attracted me, that quiet passionate intensity He sometimes has.</p><p>I was so surprised the first time He pinned me under Him that I was terrified... and He backed off.  Sometimes I think He knew all along that I'd be His by the end of things.</p><p>So I found myself at five in the morning, leaving to catch the early commuter train to Los Angeles, where I could connect onto the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner and make the six hour trainride to see Him.<p></p>He surprised me with a hug, the kind of casual affection that had become commonplace between us.  After some quick Thai we went back to His apartment.  After being solidly tired from stay up all night, and the uneasy rest rest the train ride has offered (courtesy an obnoxious 12 year old who kept kicking my seat), I found myself unable to sleep.</p><p>Being around HIm was such a physical turn on that I found myself frustrated and begging.  Yet, He denied me.  No man had ever done that before.  That in itself was a new kind of control.</p><p>Later, after much distress and anticipation He would finally take me.  It was the best sex I've hever had, whcih given the sex I've had is saying something.</p><p>It still seeed kind of casual though.  We went to the nicest New Years dinner I've ever had with a man, well the nicest any-kind-of-dinner I'd had with a man.  I craved His collar because I missed ownership, but I doubted His ability and desire to control me.</p><p>Then, after two days without sex when we were staying at His parents house, he stood up to His parents and we spent the night (still sexless) together in His childhood room.  I was hyper, horny, and above all I was a total brat.  I can admit that now.</p><p>He, in His usual calm manor, tried to calm me..  Then after He gets angry at me, He rolls over and pins me firmly, but without choking me, by the neck.  I've never felt so totaly controlled in my life.  ""Go to sleep,"" he growled into my ear, but I started giggling because I'd had a revelation.  I was totally under His control, but I realized I trusted Him to not seriously injure me.  I was so glad in that moment that we hadn't found a collar that morning... becaause I knew it would mean more now.</p><p>The next evening, back in San Louis Obispo, we found a temporary training collar, and I knelt before Him to receive it.</p><p>So here it is, my fourth training colar, and this time with this Sir - who makes me want to do and take things I've never wanted to do or take for anyone before - I think it will stick, and grow.  This time I know what it feels like to be owned.</p></font>"

"event","<p>So this is another new chapter in my life.  I've been at CSUF for two weeks and this is my first journal entry.  I'm not sure why other than that I just have no time lately.  I'm taking eighteen units.  I started out as a liberal studies major taking Liberal Studies 300 and 302A, Portuguese, Art and Civilization, and Chaucer.  Now, almost at the end of my second week, I'm a English major, with a minor in art, and a minor in history.  I'm still taking Chaucer as well as Artt and Civilization, but now I'm taking American Literature to Whitman, Contemporary Novels in English, Analysis of Literary Forms, and Structure of Modern English.  That's right!  I'm taking five different English classes.  and between two of them I have over twenty books.  With all my classes it comes to just under thirty, and that's only counting the Canterbury Tales once (despite the fact I'll likely spend all semester on it.)</p>  So this last week has been a little hectic to say the least, including multiple trips to the school and off campus bookstores; both buying and returning books.  I've read two novels, Ragtime and the Death of Ivan Ilych.  I loved the first and hated the second.  I think I'm probably going to stop attending Structure of Modern Englishs ince attendence isn't required and just learn from the book.  If it wasn't required for my major I'd never take it.  I have to say though... for a grammar class, the teacher is pretty fantastic.</p><p>Meanwhile I spend a lot of time in the (provided by) alumni lounge of the Student Union.  Someone desperately needs to give the room a bloody facelift.  The fireplace is this ugly black paneled beast, and the chairs range everywhere from modernistic blue plaid to blue Renaissance diamond pattern.  (The fact that they match doesn't do much for them)  The tables are excellent, but for coffee tables are far over-sized, and could be cut in half to make room for more students, since they're to far away to use as study tables in the main part of the room, and most people just use them as a foot rest.  The art is all black and white and far too small for the walls, the largest wall has no art, and no architectual detail.  I should write to HGTV and see if they'll come help this room with the washed out carmet and color palette.</p><p>Speaking of renovations... I've been trying to redecorate my room with little success.  I want to put a large built in bookcase into the nook where my bed used to be so that it frees up the wall that holds the clumsy crooked bookcases right now.  I turned around two of my closet doors in an attempt to get rid of the god forsaken wall of mirrors that my mother installed more than a decade ago.</p><p>There's been no luck on finding a boyfriend or a Dom lately, but I'm not over worried about it.  Right now I'm just trying to survive my eighteen units.</p>"

I've never felt so carnal with a man, or come so close and then resisted.  I wanted to be more to Him than a fuck buddy.</p><p>I didn't want to wait anymore though.  He was supposed to come and take me this last Saturday, but He stopped responding to my texts and never came.  I don't know why.  I'm not really surprised though, because this is oh so familiar.</p><p>Just like James I've had another man vanish with no explanation, and no regrets.  I've never done that to a man and I wonder why so few men have the balls to simply be honest with a woman.  I sent Him one more message today...

The air is frozen,

hanging in there,
tempting, like the smell of the mangos,

It is watching me

There was an exceptionally tall and beautiful man, all in leather standing to one side of me in the sun.  I called Him over, mostly to make sure He didn't overheat.  After I seduced him with chocolate though, and He ended up being quite charming.</p><p>The strange thing to me is that he's been at my faire for more than a year, in the guild right across the street, and I never met or noticed Him before.  Hell, He's even Papa's ward, I've known Papa since the first time I came to faire.</p><p>We ended up messing around a little bit, which is something I've never done at faire before.  I'm afraid it was just a fling for Him, but He says He's not like that.  I hope I can trust Him.  More than that, I hope His former friend with benefits doesn't kill me.  She confronted me and she seems a little violent and a little scary.</p><p>I burned myself very badly on the bread oven this week.  I'm not sure they'll be bread this week.  We might have to rebuild the door on the sucker.  It's super heating.  I was using the big leather forge gloves to take the cast iron off, and it still burned a hole right through the gloves.  I'm looking into flame resistant material that I can take to Papa and have him sew into a pair of leather gloves for me.  That should solve the problem.</p><p>Anyway, I guess it's all kind of standard at faire.  Next weekend is three-day where I start craving a shower.  Memorial day will be tough on all of us.  It always is.  I'm hoping that I don't absolutely reek, because that would be terribly embarrassing.  I want to be pretty the next time I see Him.  With a body like that... I would like my body to be better.  He says not to worry about it, but I think I'm going to do some situps anyway.  He's worried about my thyroid so I'm being very careful about making sure I take it.</p><p>He doesn't know me well enough to collar me, and I don't know Him well enough to sleep with Him.  If I have my way, both will change pretty soon.  I want to be worth Him first though.  I've never been so comfortable sleeping in a man's arms before... and He's not at all what I expected.</p></font>"

My Italian costume wasn't done, for a variety of reasons.  I didn't have time to cut the boning Peter gave me with the jigsaw, and the evil black fabric from hell was taking me much too long to pattern match.  Hopefully it will be done for this following weekend.</p><p>The cute man in the kilt didn't come back.  Maybe he still will, but he hasn't yet.  And I confess, I was disappointed.  There was something romantic about the way he kissed the back of my neck.  I was hoping he'd keep his word, but this is an awful lot to expect from a man.</p><p>The tent is standing.  That's all I can really ask for, although I have to sink a little more money into it to make it stable.  It needs a wind line, and spikes, and a seam ripper to take off the stupid velcro that wasn't supposed to come on it to begin with.  It was clean though, and it's lovely and tall and I can stand up and turn around, so there's no use in being upset about it.  The corrections can be made in time.</p>"

And I found them over, above, and around me.  I found myself buried under the bodies of my prey.  Three and four of them were tearing at me, all at once.  I tore them of and bit their necks, putting them into shuttering submission.  The blood was boiling in my head, and these labs and pups were no match for a grey wolf.  The wild would always win.

I used my Irish dress and threw scarves over it to make it work the best I could.  There was a brush fire less than a mile from the faire.  We did our best to keep the patrons calm while the fire department closed the roads and used the planes to do water drops.  ""Damned dragons!""</p><p>The skits that weekend were terribly tacky.  Rabbit was standing outside the sword vendor screaming, ""Fire sale, one day only.""  The next day there was a set of marshmallows laid out beside one of the temporary pirate faire vendors that said ""in case of fire - also these.""  I was working off the thory of course that this was all the bloody pirates' fault.  Can't they remember, ""pillage, rape, <i>then</i> burn.""</p><p>Late in the day though I was feeling lucky though, and guilty at the same time.  You see, two weekends ago, I was still dating E.B.  Luckily I met a man at faire who opened my eyes.</p><p>part way through the day I noticed a beautiful Belgium shepherd walking by and it just happened to be attached to a beautiful man.    The man was a gentleman and he wants to join my guild, which is its own type of turn on.  We had a lovely conversation, and I realized at the end of it, that I knew as much about him as I did about E.B. who I had been dating for a month.  He kissed the back of my neck and it made me smile.</p><p>When I went home the next day I broke up with E.B. partially to clear the way to date the gentleman at faire, that is if he will have me.</p><p>The reality is though, I think E.B. was only using me as a fuck buddy, and I don't need someone like that in my life.  I had thought I had a Sir, and He wasn't really over His last girlfriend.  So be it.  He can go and rebound onto someone else.  He won't even go to faire.  How lame is that?  I'd much rather date someone with chivalry and honor.  I suppose I'm single again, for the time being.</p></font>"

Not with half-assed Renaissance recreation, with annacranism, or with lecture.  Parchment Society is supposed to be a living history organization, acurate to a tee, that will spread nationally.  It would use its members to teach people about the worlds that were before this one, that we have forgotten the importance of.</p><p>I tried to start it at my local community college.  Our fundraiser left me in debt, and I can't seem to draw the members to it that I need to make it successful.  Perhaps it's because we have a pitifully small history department here, and a pitifully small history department as well.  Maybe I'll do better starting it when I move to CSU Fullerton.</p><p>I sewed my first faire costume successfully (the first one that looks good), an Irish dress complete with lacers.  It looks really good on.  Hopefully my  Italians will come out as well.  I'm helping my friend with a French costume, and another friend with boiled leather.  Between the three of us we should be able to make this society work.  I am not assured of it, but I am hopeful.</p><p>Meanwhile every Saturday I go out to the faire site and swing my hammer, brace furniture and put up walls.  I'm supposed to be putting my platform in soon, so I can build a house two years from now, but this like everything else has so much more red tape then I expected.</p><p>I just need to push through.  I miss the social relationships that most to make it worth it for my heart to complete the goals my head creates.

I'm trying to explain that I can't puff them out they're just there.  I mean hell, would that they expanded and receded at will.  Every shirt I own would fit perfectly."

"event","<p>Today I did something that I've been avoiding for the last 3-4 years.  Everyone in my family is low thyroid, and I've been exhibiting symptoms of being hypo thyroid as well for a while now.  However, due to a chronic fear of needles, it's taken me until now to get my test done.  See, once they do a blood test I proper level of synthetic or natural thyroid can be taken in caplet form, to supplement my body.</p><p>So yesterday I got an order for the second blood test in less than a year.    I'm not overly fond of blood tests because my mother's family has notoriously small veins that roll when you try and take blood from them.  My mother comes out, and says the nurse is a really good shot so I'm feeling a little better, even though I can't seem to stop myself from hyperventilating.  So I go in and the nurse, to her credit was able to draw blood from me, but for the first time ever, one of my veins actually blew.  It stopped giving blood and she took the rest of the blood from my hand like an I.V., which is really painful.  I felt like I was though to either pass out or throw up for a brief period afterwards.  Thank god for Shiki's.  There are times when good Japanese food can cure anything.</p><p>Sir was wonderful after I got my blood drawn.  There are times when He's just  a sweetheart.  I was trying to explain last night that I was lonely.  That I couldn't be with Him and miss Him all the time.  I ended up feeling like a bitch mostly.  I hate that when I'm honest I always feel mean.  He's been so kind to me, and I've repayed Him with worry and doubt.  I'm trying to be better about the whole thing.  He deserves better.</p>"

It turned out the munch event I was supposed to go to, bowling as it happened, was at 2, not at five, and so I left considerably earlier than I thought I would.    W/we got there and I bowled possibly the worst round I've ever bowled in my life, out of 10 turns in the first game I think I hit six 0s, and only one shot above a 6, for a total score of 15.

W/we got home, and we were stuck at the gate waiting for my mom to come home and let us in, because I'd forgotten my darned key for the front door.  I made everyone dessert, and was prepared to label it a fairly good day.</p><p>Then, I went up online, and was thrilled to see my Sir online, but confused as to why He hadn't called me when He got home.  Again... today He essentially had no time for me.  And I bid Him goodnight tearfully, though it was to be certain poor behavior on my part when I know He's so stressed right now.</p><p>I'm working very hard to lose weight and look better for Him, and also for myself.  I hoping very desperately that with more frequent exercise this gnawing depression will go away.  I don't have anyone to go out with though, and I do very much so hate doing it alone.  I just hate being alone in general I guess though.  I've been trying to keep myself extra busy lately so that I don't notice He's gone, and so far away.  I must confess, it's not working all together that well.</p>"

I was so in love with Him... but it turns out He wasn't worth that love, or that service.</p><p>W/we barely talked about religion so You can imagine my surprise when a month later out of no where He broke up with me because I wasn't Christian.  I couldn't believe it, because I have so little experience dealing with prejudiced people, that really I was starting to think that people like that didn't exist anymore... I was wrong though.</p><p>W/we tried being friends, but if I'm honest with myself, W/we're not anymore.  I couldn't forgive Him for that.  Not for the breakup, but for the reason He did it.  It's been almost a month since W/we parted and I'm looking again, albiet unsuccessfully.  The men I meet are looking for things that I am not, and as much as I want a Sir, I also want that Sir to want me - personality and brain intact and functioning.</p><p>I went to a party at Dragon's Gate the other day and I can't even tell You how unspeakably happy I was.  I met so many nice people there, I can hardly describe it.  I was on my way out and I hugged Belladonna, thinking she was a sub.  When I said so, she grabbed me by the hair and said, ""I'm a switch baby.""  I almost turned into a puddle of goo right there.</p><p>I was flying in subspace by the end of it, though I admit, I regretted it later when I was all alone shaking, with no one to bring me down.  I had expected the drop though, so I was almost prepared, in my own way.  Sleep was good, it took away the trembling.</p></font>"

I have missed sorely the feeling of a lover's hand upon me, in the gentle way that shows caring, and I am unsure whether I expect to find that again.</p><p>I expect that I will grow older, though in what state I'm no longer sure.

""Good evening Sir,"" she whispered, feeling the familiar warmth spread through her body and her heart.</p><p>""Good evening my little one,"" came the loving response.  He extended His hand and she lowered her lips to it, where the fingers met the hand, and kissed gently.  he drew her to Him, and then kissed her firmly on the mouth.  She took comfort in T/their now familiar ritual.  It tended to make her soft feeling, and during it she focused only on Him.  There were candles glowing softly around her and she hadn't even noticed.</p><p>""Attend,"" He murmured, and she moved easily to sit at His feet, resting her head against His knee.  Her eyes turned up to Him, big and admiring, when He shifted in a way that told her He would speak.  His reached down and twined into her hair.  ""W/we have much to discuss my kitten.""  She trembled because she knew she was just that His.</p><p>He pulled a simple black leather collar out and let her see it.  He watched her face go solemn, but not unhappy.  ""Kitten, this collar represents a commitment, and as such, it is not given lightly.  It is not something I can let you take casually, to please Me.  If you want it, if you want to be truly Mine, you'll have to ask for it.""</p><p>Her heart swelled just thinking about it.  ""I love you Sir, and I'd be honored to wear Your collar.  I will work every day to be deserving of it.""</p><p>He smiled in that way He had, simple, just pleased and approving.  ""Then kneel my little one.""</p><p>She moved onto her knees, not quite as comfortable, but far more submissive feeling.  She would've pleased Him right there, and would've been pleased to do so, but now wasn't the time.</p><p>When her eyes met His though, it was with that promise.   Her hand reached up and swept her hair away from the nape of her neck, and the cool leather wrapped smoothly around her throat.</p><p>His heart swelled at seeing her there at His feet, but there was work to do.  ""Let's begin my little one.""  She nodded, and bowed her head in what she considered a polite manner, but His hand reached out and took her chin.  ""Look at Me.""</p><p>Her eyes flew up to His and locked there, hypnotized by them.  ""Good girl,"" He whispered seductively.  ""How much can you take from Me?""</p><p>She shivered, wondering if He meant pain or pleasure.  Either way, she knew the answer.  ""I will take anything my Sir feels like giving me.""</p><p>""Are You sure kitten?"" He asked quietly.  When she nodded, His hands reached forward to fondle her breasts.  She held His eyes, even if she let a small moan slip.  Gradually, His hands moved to Her nipples.  He gave them a small warning flick, and then preceded to pinch, slowly applying more and more pressure.</p><p>So He meant pain, she thought numbly, as her breasts began to ache.  She whimpered and bit her lip to herself from crying out.  She wanted to prove to Him she could take it.  She didn't want to fail at this first test.</p><p>She kept taking it without complaint and soon her body was aching and enflamed.  She gasped, breathing a little hard.  She could see Him studying her reactions, and holding His eyes helped her keep going.</p><p>Finally, He decided she'd had enough.  ""Good,"" He said simply, as He released His hold.  She yelped and doubled over, her eyes stinging, as the rush of blood doubled the previous pain.  He chuckled, and tangled His hand in her hair. </p><p>""Just because you behave well, doesn't mean I'm going to stop kitten.  Rest easy though, I am pleased.""  His hand reached forward and started to massage away the pain, turning it into delicious pleasure.  He smiled more as she let loose a low throaty moan.  She was wrong, this didn't hurt at all.  </p><p>She let herself sink into His lovely touches and strokes until she was quivering with desire.  She was lost and caught up in Him, and He used that to surprise her.  His hand reached down and stroked her most intimite places, bringing HIs wet fingers up to show her.  ""Someone's enjoying herself, but perhaps she's forgotten to please her Sir, hmm...?""</p><p>She practically dove His pants, undoing the button and pulling them down.  He caught her hand before she got to HIs boxers though, and gave her a stern look, even if it was accompanied by a small laugh.  ""Try some finesse little one.  I already know you're eager.""</p><p>She squeaked an apology and nuzzled the bulge in His boxers tenderly.  She rose up to gently pull His shirt up over His head, then trailed her nails ever so lightly over His sides.  Her lips lowered, murmuring sweet things in a whisper over His stomach, then His left thigh.""</p><p>Finally, she pulled away the boxers that separated them, and freed Him.  She took her mouth to Him, used her tongue to lavish attention on Him, then used her throat to ravish Him.  She felt Him pulse in her as she swallowed, and took pleasure in pleasing.</p><p>Her nails were digging into His thighs, half because she knew He liked the feeling, and half to fight the ever present gag reflex that wanted her to back of His cock.  She eventually had to yank her head back to gasp for breath.  She was heading right back to it, but He growled, ""Enough,"" and she rocked back on her haunches waiting.</p><p>He motioned her to the bed and then pinned her to it, where she trembled under Him.  ""You are mine, and I can have you any time I want.  Isn't that right?"" He whispered.  She nodded.  ""Isn't that right?"" He repeated louder.</p><p>""Yes Sir,"" she responded, loving the fact that it was true.</p><p>""Good,"" He slipped on the condom, ""because I want you.""  He trust hard into her, ""Now.""</p><p>She groaned, moving under Him.  She would show Him that she could take it all for Him, but she thought as He moved over her, it might be harder to hold off than she'd thought.  She was already so close to orgasm, but she wanted so badly to wait for Him.</p><p>""Kitten, W/we'll make this a longer session next time, but this first time, I just want to come inside you,"" He groaned.</p><p>She moaned agreeably.  ""Yes, please, come,"" she panted, ""May I?  Please!""</p><p>""Yes, now!""</p><p>She came screaming around Him, as He emptied Himself into her.  He pounded her tight chasm over and over again, as she spasmed around Him like a tight vice.</p><p>When they were both finally empty, T/they stayed there locked together for a long moment before He rolled off to lay sprawled next to her.  She couldn't even begin to closer her legs, but she found the energy to curl into Him.</p><p>""You are so good my little one,"" He said stroke her hair with a yawn.  ""You're mine,"" she heard as she drifted to sleep, and she smiled because she wanted to be His.</p></font>"

They learn about the lifestyle, and it fills that place in their hearts that they didn't even know was missing.  They submit to someone that they see power in - power they feel they lack.  For while any true submissive knows that both sides have equal power in different ways, it takes the average sub some time to grasp this.</p><p>Brea came into the world of lifestyle relationships at eighteen with a perfect understanding of the dynamic.  She didn't find it, because her fantasies had been the same since before puberty.  It had always been with her.</p><p>At fifteen, with the exploration of the internet, she was able to put words and terms to those secret desires.  She considered and rejected safewords, finally picking one to hold close to her heart, for times when even her own imaginings got too out of hand for her.</p><p>She was dating self-proclaimed Doms at seventeen.  If she was honest, there was something lacking in all of them.  She could usually gain control if she really wanted to, and there was quite a bit of swithing in those first few relationships.  She found being a Dominant didn't satisfy her though.  After all, in her fantasies, she was the one kneeling at someone else's feet.</p><p>She made the conscious decision to not fight anymore.  After all, what was the point of a fight she didn't even have to work at?  After she turned eighteen, she lost her virginity to a nineteen-year old who said He was a Dom.  He wouldn't have been able to control her if she hadn't let HIm, but she loved Him, and she knew when she did something bad, even if He couldn't tell the difference.  In the end, He didn't have enough confidence to keep her, even though she wasn't fighting, and she shed His training collar.</p><p>She set impossible standards after that, afraid to be hurt in the same way again.  She wasn't content with switching, or submitting just because she felt like it.  She wanted someone who knew what they were doing; someone who would make her feel like her submission was not only right, but necessary.</p><p>And if her heart suffered from loneliness from those standards?  She told herself it was better than ending up with someone else who, in the longrun, wouldn't be able to hold her either.</p><p>Loneliness gave way to other things, until she wasn't sure she'd end up at all.  She kept dating out of duty, because she was afraid she'd shrivel up if she let herself be alone.  She stopped getting offers from people who interested her though.  Half of them were older than her parents, and those who remained were either looking for casual sex, or possessed very little intelligence, and were therefore of very little interest to her.</p><p>She had finally promised herself that she was going to delte all her online profiles, and focus on finding some one in the real world, when during her last check of her mailbox, she received a pecular message.  Someone had sent her Shakespeare.</p><p>Very soon, she put a message up, telling the many men who bothered her that she was taken, and happy.  When T/they laid together, she rested content and happy, only vaguely aware that this was only the beginning.</p></font>"

My father died at war before I was born, and all I know of him is that I take his name, and that he was an honorable soldier.  He left my mother everything he had, but it only lasted so long, as his pay matched his rank, which was not high up.  It was by the kindness of Isabelle's mother, my mother's friend, Missus Kendall, that I came to spend my summers playing in warm beach sands, surrounded by the scent of golden flowers and Isabelle.</p><p>We used to run together into the cold water, and our clothing would stick to us.  There was nothing to be revealed as we were young, and if there had been something to see, the clothing would've covered it anyway.  The salt from the water matted our hair, which never bothered me overly.  Once and a while though, I could hear her crying upstairs as her nursemaid detangled her hair.  I always wanted to make her smile after that, and usually succeeded.</p><p>My mother, for her part was likely not as happy as she seemed, though it took me a great many years to understand this.  Mister Kendall, you see, had exacted a kind of toll from my mother, as a way of payment for his wife's charity.  I do not know if Missus Kendall ever knew of her husband's actions, though I suspect she might have, as she and my mother became increasingly distant and smiles came less easily between them.</p><p>We were young then though, and when voices became uneasy, we were always able to slip away.  I can recall very vividly one balmy afternoon when she lay with her head in my lap, golden hair spread back behind her shoulders like an angel's, as she watched the clouds and I watched her.</p><p>I fell in love with her that afternoon, though I was only ten.</p></font>"

It had all been about ice to him, and she was just grateful now that the lightning kept the sky too hot for the pain to freeze.</p><p>He had been her angel with green eyes so sharp and cold they could've killed her.  She'd loved the sharp danger, not the man.  He'd taken a serrated knife with teeth as sharp as swords to do the deed.  He cut off each feather from his wings, and hacked through the bones until he could no longer be mistaken for the seraphin she loved.  Then he'd dropped her off the cliff he'd towed her up, and fallen with her on the half-skeleton of broken wings.</p><p>She kept expecting the pain to hit, but when it didn't, her despair deepened at having to watch as she fell further and further away from her world.  After a while, the air became heavy with the perfume of orchids, and old loves.  She embraced them while clinging to the still breathing body of the angel, her once-angel covered in blood.  They left their marks of shame on her brow, the same color as his death, and she took strange comfort in dead love, because at least it wasn't dying.</p></font>"

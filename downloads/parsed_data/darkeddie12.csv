"event","<p><font size=""1"">so i noticed today about how feelings can cloud and affect judgement<br />when you like someone, you try to point out all their good qualities to kind of reassure yourself<br />you find any reason to keep on liking them<br />and any reason to stay with them or pursue something<br />you can be blinded and not see the bad in front of you<br />or just choose to ignore it<br />it's only when you create space and distance<br />that you can truly weigh the good against the bad<br />and see how wrong someone really is for you and how you've been fooling yourself<br />and when something is over, you can see just how much someone really cared for you<br />you see just how you could have been wasting your time on something that wasn't going anywhere<br />and you could have been finding someone better<br />but feelings always get in the way<br />feelings&nbsp;are the worst kind of drugs<br />the ones you need to give in to no matter what<br />it's only once you step back and analyze everything<br />that you can get everything in order<br /><br />today was such a joke<br />i hope you choke on all those words you said<br /><br />yesterday was beyond amazing<br />for so many reasons<br />i loved the show<br />i love my friends<br />i love our random adventures<br />who would have thought a year ago that i'd be where i am now<br />who would have thought i'd have a group of friends like i do now?<br />and my boring typical weekends would turn into adventures all the time<br />only one piece missing but i'll get used to it<br /><br />i'm entering the next phase in my life<br />and some things are the same and others are different<br />and i'm more fine with it everyday<br /><br />so i was lost for a while<br />and i thought i had found myself<br />but it turns out i became someone else<br />but now i'm on the right track<br />and i really like it<br />hello 15 year old eddie<br />you were nice&nbsp; (:<br /><br />my hair is finally starting to get long again<br />i am soooo happy :)<br />i miss my long hair );<br /><br />school is a bitch<br />someone save me?&nbsp; D:<br />luckily i have a good influence helping me out&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />lawlz 11 months<br />how cute<br /><br />you might have noticed&lt;3<br /><br />i wish it was last night again<br />like really bad<br />from good time at the show<br />with a bunch of great people<br />from eating mcdonalds and having funny convos<br />to racing each other on the highway<br />to flicking each other off and mooning each other lol<br />to the most random/funny/awkward/wrong conversations in the car<br />water flying everywhere<br />and throwing runts(the candy)&nbsp;at each other<br />and kicking over trashcans and running lol<br />it was soooo amazing<br />and goodnights are the best&nbsp; :)<br /><br />3-2-08 forever&nbsp; (:<br />best night of my life fersure</font></p>"

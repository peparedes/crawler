Miss Weasley, Miss Patil, 

First off, for your efforts toward interhouse communication I award each of you <b>15 points</b> for your respective houses. That done, I believe this is a excellent idea indeed. Just what the students need to take their minds off some of the more unpleasant aspects of the summer and to help them begin the school term fresh and happy. For that, you may have the use of the Great Hall after dinner on the first Friday eve after your return. You two will, of course, be responsible for seeing that it is prepared, though I do believe that I, myself, and possibly Professor Flitwick could be enticed to assist you there. 

I will be delighted to see the both of you, safe and smiling, when you return to the castle.

I have been meaning, of course, to come to visit you. However I have been detained preparing for the return of our students. While you in Hogsmead, however, do feel free to stop in at the castle and pay me a visit. The special password to my office, which will work solely for you today, will be ""Raspberry Creame"".

I would be delighted to see you, my dear, and the castle - I am sure - would welcome you back for a visit. At your earliest convienence, I will meet with you.

"event","My Fellow Witches and Wizards, Concerned Parents, and most importantly of all, Students, 

Before rumours begin to mar and twist the truth, I would like to clarify what has happened. No doubt those of you using these journals have, by now, discovered a post by the dark wizard Tom Riddle, more commonly known as Lord Voldemort. You see then, that the worst has come to pass. The Second War has certainly begun. 

However, only just. And though I caution you greatly to be more cautious as you write publicy here on things of holidays and your location, there is as of yet no good reason to stay your lives in response to this. Continue as close to normalcy as you can manage, and be kind an good to one another, for there are few powers greater than those of indifference and love. 

Students, you are safe. And you will be safe once you return to these walls. I will not say that the world has not become more dangerous, but I will promise that I, myself, and the other Professors are continually working to ensure that while you are ours, at least, and for as long as we can after, you are protected."

Miss Granger, 

I have thought on your request, and I do believe that a short visit would be in Harry's best interests. Please get in touch with Remus Lupin immediately to make preparations. And I do trust you to not tell anyone of this until he has given you leave to. 

I do trust that you are having a good summer holiday, and that this permission is a pleasant surprise.

The castle does seem so empty now, as it always does in the summer months. Would anyone care to humour an old man by stopping in for a spot of tea?"

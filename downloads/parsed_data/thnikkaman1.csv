"event","i hate it when one of your really close friends hurts you so bad, that all you can do is forgive, forget, and move on even though it is like the hardest thing in the world to forget about them, and how much they hurt you....it is just like carly was saying in her last LJ entry....its not like a quick razor blade cut like a heart break would have been. but its like a dull knife, where you can feel the pain so deeply. and with every phone call or text message it cuts deeper and deeper, so deep that ill be lucky if the scar ever goes away. its already cut so deep that i dont even kwow what to do anymore... i just walk around confused, and depressed. thanks to my REAL frens who try to make me feel better, even though most of the time it doesnt work....

i had a alot of fun with alyse and carly and anna on saturday... thanks girls, i needed it... i love how they understand me like no one else can-its awesome

i hate track and i cant wait till this season is over, so i can be done forever...."

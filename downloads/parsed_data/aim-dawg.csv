"event","drama drama drama. oh how I love it. You would think making a 23 year old girl cry would be more fun. You would think pissing off someone you hate would be more fun. You would think getting trashed and falling down a flight of stairs would be more fun. Why wasn't it fun you ask?....I've devastated one of my best friends lives. She doesn't deserve to be treated like shit and she can do so much better. I would tell her that it's for the best and to let it go, but when you've been there you think about things a little differently. I can't tell her not to love him. I can't tell her to just get over it. I can't say anything to maker her feel better or make it any easier. All I can do is whatever she asks of me and sit back and hope she sees that she's only lost something that's going to make her a better person because of it."

"event","I broke my back at work tonight...ouch. I layed down for half an hour to read a little while ago and when I got up to pee (because I pee a thousand times a night) I literally couldn't walk and was waddling around making old lady noises. I went downstairs to take some Ibu when my dad came upstairs. I told him about my aches and pains and he went looking for the percasettes he had from when he had back pain. With no luck finding them he told me to take a shot of his whiskey. I thought that was funny because he was dead serious. I didn't jump at the chance though because of the Ibu I had just taken and the two things don't really mix. I tried to sleep laying on my side with a pillow between my knees but I was still in so much pain I decided to give up on sleep until the pain killers kick in and write a little. And I'm suppose to play soccer on Thursday night but I don't really see how if I'm still hurtin'. That really sucks too because I lied to get out of my last game so I could go get drunk instead. I've only played one game but I'm brooooken. Melissa is going to be tict off. Oh well, I'll just go and support the team with some wicked cool cheers. Maybe they won't hate me if I still show up. This better not put a damper on my vacation this weekend either. I guess it will get me out of helping Jack move though, that's one good thing. Poopie, I hate ouchies. I would go to the doctor but my dad said they won't do anything. I said they'd give me fun pills, but who knows. I might make a doctor's appointment for thursday morning. Knowing the jew doctors they'll probably x-ray me which will cost me hundreds of dollars and then not give me any happy pills. That would really piss me off. I'm getting up early to go with Xan...somewhere...it's a secret, shhh. Even if I'm unable to move I still want to go. We always have a good time and being broken doesn't stop me from having fun. I might call out of work tomorrow though, depending on whether I'm able to move. Well, I guess I've whined enough about my back for one evening. Bah, sshhhh you."

"event","I swear I think I have insomnia. I never get to sleep before 4am, but then again I barely ever wake up before 1pm. I don't want to live this way. My days are completely wasted. I wake up lay around and watch tv, take a shower and go to work. Granted I usually go out somewhere after work, but normally to eat. Let's not get into my self-esteem issues and thinking I'm fat because that's what eating is all about. I've gotten to the point where I think eating is a sin. No matter what or how little I eat I always think it's bad and too much. I wish I could go back to having constant anxiety where my food was so limited because I was constantly sick to my stomach. I know that's bad and probably border-lined on having an eating disorder but it made me feel better. I think I eat too much anyway. But going back to having constant anxiety would mean being friends again and I'd just rather not. It was an unhealthy relationship for both of us and I'm just done. Plain and simple. I've come to the conclusion that I have no self-respect or self-worth. I just really hate myself most of the time. Wow, doesn't that sound depressing and pathetic. But I am pathetic. I can't get rid of the one person in my life that I once loved enough to one day marry but treats me like a piece of shit. He doesn't care about me and I don't love him...I tell myself I do so that when I spend time with him I can justify it. I'm just pathetic and lonely and looking for the companionship and warm body next to mine that I use to have. I should be looking somewhere else but it's too hard. I don't want to have to start over, it takes so much effort to get to know and find out what they like and adapt to their intimate styles and all that jazz. I just want it to be done and over with for me to enjoy someone again. I just keep setting myself up for failure, over and over and over again. Whether I'm falling for someone completely out of reach for reasons that can never change or I give a first impression of someone who is broken inside. I am broken. I have been tainted for any man who may ever want to become a part of my life. I suck. So what do I do now? How do I fix myself. I know I have to be the one to do it because they always say ""Someone else can't fix you, you have to fix yourself"" and they also say ""You have to love yourself before you can love someone else"". Well you know what? That sucks. Not everyone can be that strong and maybe this is a big pitty party for myself but I'm in that kind of a mood. I really should just suck it up and get over it, but you know what, that's why I got this livejournal so I could sit and bitch to this computer screen where no one will respond and I feel as if I'm getting it all out there. So ha. Whatever, whatever I DO WHAT I WANT. And by the way...suck of this a one time"

"event","A split second of confused passion. 
    
     The hand on top of mine. I hesitate, then in fear pull a little, but the hand tightens and I am unable to free myself from the temptation and bliss of his soft touch. We act as if nothing has happened but in that short moment we both know we felt the sheer excitement of a first innocent touch.

     The butterflies flutter and our eyes do not meet, but I know you're feeling the same way. Wanting almost needing a further embrace. In a second it's over and all that is left is a sense of disappointment and a longing for another small embrace that might lead to something more...

ha, wouldn't you like to know

Had a pretty boring day. Didn't wake up until 3:30, which isn't a rare occasion these days. Went to work at 6 and that was about it. I'm going to Virginia Tech this weekend to help good ol' Jack-inator move from one apartment to another. I'm looking forward to being drunk all weekend and warching Jack move boxes and heavy stuff around...because I'm lazy and won't help...hehe. And then next weekend I'm off to Canadia...WOOOHOOO! More drunkeness for me. Unlike last time we will be stopping in Buffalo to get wings...mmmm wings. I can't wait, work has become such a damn chore, it will be nice to have another vacation."

"event","Jason finally came home last night. Xan and I drove down to Silver spring to visit after being ditched by our so-called friends from work. Bieeetches. After many agonizing hours spent with Frankie jibber jabbering Xan, Jason, and I stayed up til the wee hours of the morning (6:30) just talking...mostly about sex. At least I know I was just talking...who knows what those other crazy kids were doing in Jason's bed. Jason woke us up around 9...yes, I'm serious, and after a while we went back to Frederick...Jason included, to grab some lunch. Xan and I tried to find someone who would work for us that evening but failed miserably. After a surprisingly pleasant night of work I went to Mashburn's to play Trivial Pursuit with Mash-piece, Steve-o, and Big Al. As crazy as it may sound it was a blast. Mashburn and I won because he is a weirdo genius at that game and we all had a lot of laughs and good times. So, go me. I rock. The end. Oh wait...I'm happy...hehehe."

I'm stressed out with our class play. I'm ultimately confused...I'm having deep, dark circles around my eyes and blogging seems foreign to me now. I have a short story to write and I'm nowhere near to starting with it. I&nbsp;feel like crap."

I'm fuming against somebody whom I shouldn't fume on. And the weather's with me on this. It's cold, wet and dark. Along with the occasional thunder and lightning occurrence, my mood's with that flow. 

I just hope that I stop acting and feeling like nonsense before tomorrow 'coz it's gonna be a quiz filled hell of a day. If I were allowed to broadcast a whole lot of cuss and fuss, I might be spending the whole night doing it.

Yeah, So it's still flu season and I think it's getting up my head. It's driving me up the wall. I'm creating my own problems when I shouldn't be. I'm turning people into bananas and forcing myself to hate them when I can't. It's bananas for crying out loud. It made me walk when I was barely 3. 

Anyway, true, I'm becoming crazy. I'm trying to find faults in sparklers just so I could make a study about them. I'm going to suicide because I'm taking up a course that's totally not part of my oh-so-sure strengths. Basically, I'm ranting because I'm scared. I feel naked, bare. Stripped off of the things I find comforting. My pillow doesn't even feel as soft as before. I'm as scared as hell and I'm sort of pushing people away. Well, not yet. But I'm getting there. And I don't want to. 

See, I'm getting crazy."

It sucks when I get too much into the moment that I could rage out right away when someone breaks it. I have a really bad attitude when it comes to that.

Anyway, once I got home, apparently tired from the so-called practice, I graded all the test papers for SN. Part of me was enraged by the totally horrible grammar. And a part of me was laughing my ass off at the others' tendency of being plain stupid. I'm cruel. This is my site, fuck off if you don't want to read.

I'm practically going to school tomorrow just to listen to how universities do their magic talking. I'm gonna sit my ass all day listening to them do the business talk. As of now, I'm trying to device schemes on how to sneak in some stuff and do unfinished work like my learning paper, my math assignment and my conclusion-less column. 

I feel frustrated by the thought that I've so much to accomplish but laziness is engulfing me. It sucks, I know. 

So much for that. i wish tomorrow would go smoothly. And I hate to get into another playful row with him. It's irritating."

I haven't done my tradition of posting on the first day of classes since I was preoccupied with the assignments and requirements. So I'm just gonna go over a recap of what I've been up to this first official week of hell, I mean, classes.<br /><br />The line up of teachers are great! I'm the student of the two teachers I've been looking forward to having to teach me. Yeay me! I'm in a class whom I believe would make my last year in Seton worthwhile. And I'm living the hectic life I've been asking for this summer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Although it was quite a bummer that Ms. Ditas had to be on leave for a month due to some health reasons, I'm glad that we're finally getting down to the actual lessons. We're having our first seatwork in Math on Monday and I have to study for it. The class is in the process of producing a play for English- a requirement for the quarter. Kinda decided on producing Lysistrata since the first quarter would mostly be about Greek and Roman Mythology. So we had to stick to the Greek culture.<br /><br />I'm living my role as the managing editor which is equal to doing nothing. Haha! But I'm doing what I can to help EIC almighty even if it's just accompanying her to the office. I'm hopeless. Incompetent. =[ Though, it's really excellent that the articles are on their way to layouting. We're just having little difficulty with the GS section of the paper. Apparently, they're going way off the submission period. But I'm hoping that we can finally release an issue that isn't late and unworthy of reading.<br /><br />If you're wondering why I'm writing so freely tonight, it's because Mom and Dad aren't home tonight. Mom had dinner with her friends and Dad is in Bacolod spending the weekend with Lola because it's her birthday today. It's quiet. Even the tricyles outside aren't bothering to broom their way on the main road.<br /><br />I still have alot of thoughts in my mind that I want to empty myself with. Like how I got a little pissed off during ZLL or how the humid weather is getting on my nerves. I just remembered that I'm gonna have to pay a fee for an overdue book at the library. Sucks, I know. I'm leaving it to this.&nbsp; <br /></span><br />"

I tend to make really striking jokes that dangerously tread between insult and humor.</span><br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"">It's really miserable on my part because I have the tendency to speak before thinking.

But it kinda bothers me on the thought that I'm reverting into my tactless habit. <br /><br />I've been labeled 'tactless' countless times. I've gotten into scrapes with it. I've humiliated myself with it. And I admit that I lose my tact when I can't put it on paper.

It's worse 'coz I might have waged a war already if my tongue slipped the details on the wrong person.<br /><br />However, I am trying to make up for my rash attitude that comes along with my strong personality.

"event","Today was the last Seminar Day of the week. We had Mr. Ferdinand Jarin as guest speaker and I had a great time listening on what he had to say. <br /><br />Here's my<strong> <em>baon:</em></strong><em> </em><br /><ol><li><strong>Writing is expressing a purpose. </strong>Mr. Jarin said that writing isn't just about getting to see your name on the byline but getting to express what we have to say. I see it as being functionally generous. By the term, I mean that in every output that we make, both reader and writer should benefit from it. I realized that it's not all about catharsis/ purgation. It has to have <em>pabaon </em>with it.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Have a focus. </strong>He also told us that as writers, we have a tendency to write about everything we want to write...in one output. And I am one of those people. And I know it because of my previous blog posts. Try reading those really long rant posts I make. It blames almost everything that breathes in this world. Mr. Jarin said that we should focus on something specific and try to stick to the topic or we'd go putting in all sorts of ideas turning the output into lugaw (porridge).</li><li><strong>Heightened Consciousness. </strong>I still can't grasp that concept but it sounds really smart and dramatic that I really wanted to add this here. LOL! Although the way I understand it, it's close to being focused with the topic of discussion.</li><li><strong>Know what you want to convey. The HOW comes after. </strong>That's what we all do. Or it's sabaw =))</li><li><strong>Never censor. </strong>I've been hearing this since ArtsWork. So far, I've been uncensoring myself when trying to find really good ideas. Mr. Jarin told us that censoring should be used after we've written our thing. But as long as we're still formulating, unleash the imagination!</li><li><strong>Defamiliarization.&nbsp;</strong>I remember Sir Jethro Tenorio when I heard this word this morning. I miss ArtsWork. And I clearly remember the animal trasformation activity we did three weeks ago. I learned that Defamiliarizing could lead to a good output.</li><li><strong>Never follow what the seminar teaches you. </strong> They're just guides. Discover new techniques, he said. Break the rules. Produce fresh insights. &quot;Forget what the speaker said!&quot; Everything will come in handy when the time comes. (similar to what Mr. Glenn Mas said in ArtsWork!)</li></ol>So that's the very striking baon I've brought home probably for this week, too. <br /><br />Oh yes! and the immortal motto: <strong>Read, Read, Read!</strong><br />"

"event","<p>So we finally had the copyreading seminar for around two hours. It was so fast since none of us really had any questions on the topoic. Had one article to work on then after verifying together, we were sent home. The teachers had a seminar-reason why we were sent home at 11:30.<br /><br />Then I spent the day at dad's office again. I was glued to the laptop the whole time finding ways to kill boredom. I finished the fifth chapter of the fanfic I'm currently working on and posted it right away. I opened my account a while ago and I've received 2 comments which were total praises. Yeay! That's why I'm feeling lightheaded. The review was sugarcoated to the point that&nbsp;my head's inflating.

Anyway, having received the text message, I was a little bummed out knowing that I'd be spending&nbsp;the day in a house that's supposed to be an office with my dad and his co-workers.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;I was practically being a&nbsp;<em>tambay&nbsp;</em>there making&nbsp;<em>sagap&nbsp;</em>of the internet with the laptop's wireless&nbsp;modem. My brother, on the contrary, moved inside that place like it was his own. And it&nbsp;made me laugh a little.<br /><br />Now, I'm in school, using SN's PC to post this. It's kinda scary&nbsp;being alone in here. Not that 'supernatural beings' creep me out but the fact that someone might find the time to snoop inside and catch me in here using the PC at 4 in the afternoon clearly not on official business.

"event","I'm still <em>lutang </em>over ArtsWork even if I'm already on the second half of my summer seminar frenzy. Although this morning still seemed blurry to me, having to think about what's next to happen made me realize the cause of this blur. <em>I'm forgetting my roots.</em> I'm forgetting my origin, the things in writing that I've learned on my own. My old realizations. <br /><br />I was reading Daniel's blog a while ago and I came across his latest post which was short, bilingual but full of what he wants to say...or so I think. Then I realized why I was having a hard time with news writing, creative writing, or simply blogging - which I'm trying to do right now. I'm censoring myself too much. I'm forgetting the number one rule of the artist's code - Never censor yourself.<br /><br />Now that I've figured out my what, I've got to know the then-what happens. And while I'm finding a good solution to my little dilemna, I've to keep typing random sentences that come out of my head just so the cursor would stop mocking me...with...its slow, repetitive blinking. *Poof* I got my answer! I've got to go back from where i've started. And that was about three years ago when I started this blog. I have to keep on writing and reading. I&nbsp;have to be the book-whore that I'm supposed to be if I want to keep expressing myself the way I'm supposed to. <br /><br />**<br />Notice that it's incoherent. And it kinda sucks knowing that I inflicted this on myself. I neglected my everyday ritual of writing anything and everything to keep my head spinning in the 'proper' direction. Now I have to start over. To the simplest of words and sentences. To the most random and incoherent thoughts. <br /><br /><em>I have to repent.</em><br /><br />Just Kidding. Nothing seems to connect. And I don't care any less. So what, right? I'm learning and it's good to be backward sometimes. <br /><br /><br /> <br />"

[ang hangin... grabe]<br /></em><br />Since this Ateneo ArtsWork started, I've learned alot of things about myself and the world. And this, personal truth, as they claim it to be, is fascinating now that the source of my <em>amazing </em>creativity actually has a name. Personal truth!<br /><br />So what's my personal truth that's been bothering me the past few days?<br /><br />I'm like my parents...combined. Like yeah.. duh! But seriously, besides the biological aspect, when they both act in front of us children, may it be a little squabble on some current event like some political hypocrite still having a face to show in public or a 'yes and' conversation about American Idol, I sometimes see exactly how the way I would act if I were in a similar situation...with younger pals. Being a little direct, my being stubborn, shrewd, cheerful, ridiculous, and reflective comes from my dad. And my goal-driven, aggressive, outspoken, passionate and snubbish side comes from my mom. So it seems that I'm a person with slight contradiction. That's why when I'm in deep trouble, I get very quiet. <br /><br />So there's this little swear I did with my folks a few months ago about lessening my extra-commitments especially in play directing. And I am being committed to that little swear. But a while ago in Ateneo, it seemed to me that the commanding spirit I have is itching to get out of my system. Visions keep popping in my head as the play writers made the script. Ideas came swarming like thousands of insects migrating. And it can't, it shouldn't. I can't be the boss this time. I shouldn't be under the limelight because I'm controlling it. I took the backseat and I should stay seated there. And I will.<br /><br />The main point of this whole article is that I'm being a person too strong for the role that I chose to play. And it feels weird. Thirsting for power. And I have no idea where it comes from. I think it's the only thing that doesn't run in the family but in my blood. <br /><br />People call me a control-freak and I can even scare my own teachers with a look that says blank. And my mom kinda has that look too. People who don't really know her have the impression that she's mataray when she just holding a face with no expression. There are more things that I dodn't mention that runs in the family that I couldn't relate with ArtsWork so I omitted them. I feel totally scattered-brained. I need sugar.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

So anyway, I haven't gotten any news from Iman this whole week regarding the seminar/training for SN. What I'm nervous about is that it might be next week and I'm out for the whole week since I'm gonna be in Bacolod for a whole week's vacation. yes, that means less computer, less fanfic writing and lesser lack of sleep. Though I'm afraid that it's gonna become an eating frenzy there. Province food can be very delicious.

Moving on. I'm feeling pretty numb this summer. It's like on the last day of classes all emotions came floating in the sky. But I've been having weird dreams lately with my teachers, classmates, friends and my school as starring roles. it feels like school is haunting me as early as April and I've been having a hard time getting myself to sleep during the night. Creepy as it is but I feel that there's a pair of eyes looking at me while I sleep. My imagination can go really wide in the dark.

The 6 of us, Daniel, Gil, Patrick, Iman, Shirra and I, totally gave the SN office a makeover. The office looks wider on the sides and the messy copies have been bundled and arranged properly after so long. Shirra even arranged the old magazine issues by releasing dates. Talk about all of us being OC today. We even roughly discussed the possible news articles for the first issue. It was fun. <br /><br />Going home was a wreck. It started to drizzle then after Dani got his dvd rental at videocity, it totally rained so I arrived at southville drenched in rain and sweat. My shirt smelled and everything totally sucked.<br /><br />When we got home, we ate the usual non-meat dinner then dad wanted some pizza so we went across the street to buy some. He got his pizza and beer mix while we savored the not-so hot sauce with the mushroom and garlic toppings.<br /><br />Before totally retiring here in my room to type everything, I had to arrange the broadband settings in both PCs.

Everything started yesterday. It was ARC release day. The plan that day was for mom to fetch our cards for us instead of us coming along. At around 10 am, Mika texted me, asking if I was going to school. Chikka texted her saying that I wasn't coming. I asked her if there was any problem and she hesitated in answering back. Forced her to tell me and she said that I had a 79 in Math. 

I was terribly shocked that I repeatedly told myself that it was just a joke. When mom arrived, I immediately looked at the ARC and a 79 was printed on it. I was shocked. Seeing the grade made me choke. My appetite had gone away and everything tasted the same.

That's why I decided to come with mom today so I could talk with my Math teacher. Then I found out that he hadn't encoded my exam grade in. Must have overlooked it with the tons of work.

Now, I have still have a deadline to beat and I am nowhere near to even start one now.

"event","<span style=""font-size: small;""><u><strong><font face=""Book Antiqua"">Thursday, March 19</font></strong></u><font face=""Book Antiqua""><br /> <br />A day after Charmaine's birthday bash at Marga's House, I was required to attend the so-called recognition practice. I was totally not in the mood to come mainly because my mind was set in vacation status already. Moreover, to me, attending the whole thing makes me look.. bitter. For the fact that I've been attending recognition day because of in-campus academic reasons. Now, I'm attending because of an off-campus competition. Not that I'm not grateful for it. I am grateful for winning. It's just that awarding the merit on the competition itself is enough for me. Trying to recognize what I achieved more than that is well...being prideful already.<br /><br />Anyway, so there I was sitting inside the FBA Auditorium, clearly bored and pissed off. All adults inside the room were clearly not ready to practice us. The Emcee himself kept on telling us &quot;off-campus winners&quot; that we all couldn't practice the right blocking today, that he hadn't arranged the line-up, that we still had to lift are asses up to mockingly walk on-stage to receive the certificate, etcetera.<br /><br />All in all, I wasted my time that day. So I decided to not go the next day and attend on Monday. Surely, they all have to be ready by then 'coz Monday's general rehearsal. And they can't blame me for not coming on Friday. What's more is that I'm not ignorant enough to indulgently destroy the whole program. I know the flow since I was in the fifth grade. Yeah, that's what's weird with my school. Programs that involve utsiders attending - especially our parents- have to always be prim and proper to the point that every move we make- from the wiping of sweat, the breathing, the position of arms, legs and hands, to the way we all have to mov when we are needed- must be exactly the same, like robots.<br /><br />Ranting about how I wasted my time wouldn't erase what happened. So I'll relate what happened in the evening. I was playing the flash game 'Burger Tycoon' (something I found while surfing mom's computer at SFU). It was very addicting. Besides that, I was also reading some online fanfics written by random teens hoping that I would learn a new intelligent word. I found David Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius dragging (there were too much events that were, to me, very trivial). Unfortunately, I haven't found a new word.<br /><br />Going back, my eyes were glued to the PC. Then when I felt sleepy and everything felt boring, I decided to retire in my room. I had climbed the stairs and was going to open the door. I tried fiddling with the knob, not believing I was locked out of the second floor. So technically, that also means I'm locked out of my room, too. I tried knocking, calling my parents and my brother. Nobody answered and I just heard a lound grunt type of snore. I figured they were all dead asleep. So I gave up and set myself on the couch. Afraid that monsters would come get me (since there were two large doors to my side and and in line with my foot), I decided to fall asleep with the television on.&nbsp;<br /><br />At around 2 am, I heard my mom calling me. She woke up and heard the tv going on. Thanks to the tv she noticed I wasn't in my room. She asked me why I was still downstairs. Told her I was locked out. Shocked was her expression and I didn't care 'coz I felt sticky, hot, and really really sleepy. <br /><br /><u><strong>Friday, March 20</strong></u><strong><br /><br /></strong>I woke up because of the text messages flooding my inbox. I was really surprised and freaked out by the unknown number texting me. I thought it was some prank genius on a modus out to extort load. Once I read it, I thought it was Ms. Nanette. I was having doubts to follow what the message had said so I decided to reply and ask for and ID. Told me that it was the Ateneo SOH Dept.'s phone. I gave them a ring. They phoned that I was accepted to the Workshop I applied and I have to wait for two weeks for the formal letter to arrive. I felt excited at first, feeling no interest to take my chicken and hotdog brunch. Then I became anxious. Then t turned to confusion. By the end of the lunch time, I felt really dizzy. <br /><br />Mom and Dad got home late because the Nissan broke down so they had to leave the car at Caltex overnight. I slept early 'coz I had alot to to the next day<br /><br /><u><strong>Saturday, March 21</strong></u><strong><br /></strong><br />I woke up 'coz I had to pee. I planned to bathe the dogs and fix the files piling up my desk. For today, the only things I've accomplised were helping mom out in writing the written report of her students (part of their edexcel curriculum) and bathing the dogs. Fixing my files would be moved in another day.<br /><br />Mom went out with her friends for their monthly 'girls' night out' routine. The three of us stayed at home. Dad had a visitor who had two tickets to a <em><strong>&quot;concert&quot; slash mosquito fest</strong></em>. My brother and I were forced to attend. Well, for the fact of being courteous enough to the guy and my thinking that dad wanted us out of the house. Probably wanted a quiet man-to-man talk with the visitor. Whatever. Anyway, we went home at around 10pm 'coz we couldn't stand the atmosphere and the main performers of the night were terribly late not to mention the entire event started one and a half hour late. It pissed me off. I was totally frowing inside the coliseum the whole time. <br /><br />The fun part was when we got home. My brother got my dad to give us money. We used it to buy pizza and drinks. We ate it with the left-over chicken from dinner. I'm still full right now. <br /><br />Tomorrow's church day and I have no idea what to wear. <br /><br /><strong><em>ended at 12:47</em></strong><br /></font><br /></span>"

It's the last week of classes and we I'm still staying up til 10pm. Insomnia visited me last night and I woke up sleepy and tired. I've been having crazy dreams during the weekend and part of it is driving me crazy. There are things that I shouldn't be bothered about that bother me. There are matters that shouldn't be thought about but I'm thinking of. There are issues that I have to focus on that I'm neglecting.<br /><br />I'm fighting sleep right now just so I can get the final output of our feasibility study. Mom should read it by tomorrow 'coz the defense was moved on Wednesday, a should be no-class day. Screw you, substitute. Anyway, I'm being a sinner and I know I should refrain from being one.<br /><br />I should be studying Chem right now if my eyes don't ache. It's starting to droop and red veins are creeping towards my pupil. I feel tired and nothing's registering in my brain. I feel like a vegetable. I'm pretty miserable right now.<br /><br />What's more is that I forgot my swimming bag at school where my swimgear, towel, clothes and deodorant are. I hope that it's still there tomorrow. The whole package means something to me. They're not just smelly gym clothes. <br /><br />However miserable I can get in here, I still have to put up a good face tomorrow. It'd be a shame if I bring personal matters into other people's businesses. <br /><br /><em><strong>Shit happens because we make it happen.</strong></em><br /></font></span>"

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 128);""><font face=""trebuchet ms"">Yesterday was pretty crappy. We had 3 quizzes yesterday, a play, and a big deal of tears just kept pouring out of everyone. Everything felt wrong and I am still annoyed about it.<br /><br />It all started from the first period. I was really quiet because I was weighing how I'm supposed to get the Quiz in Chem during lunch so I could use my time in HR to set things up for the play. Basically, I was distracted the whole period leaving me yet again one of those who haven't taken the practical quiz. <br /><br />Surprisingly, the second period was Math when it should have been English. We had our last seatwork for the year. It kinda sucked on my part 'coz I was nearly there into proving one of the equations as true when we were told to stop answering and passing the quiz forward.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then came English. We were invited to witness a symposium about May-December love affairs. The topic should have been interesting if the performers hadn't screwed up their speeches. For me, it ended up to be another &quot;I'll just enjoy the air-conditioning&quot; moment. We were dismissed way after the lunch bell. I think it was 20 minutes before the time so my plan to take the Chem quiz was ruined. <br /><br />Then came the other problem. The pull-out form. Nobody knew that the thing wasn't processed and it was already HR period. So it ended up pissing our teacher off because we were late and she didn't know anything about the gig and us taking the quiz. I failed identification part as always. Though I'm pretty confident with the problem solving portion. I prepared myself for that the night before. I even slept at 11pm just to master the damn thing. The period ended with the words, &quot;I would appreciate a little, no not a little, but even just a minuscule of respect&quot; ringing in my ears.<br /><br />Technically, my mood to do the play was below 0. I was annoyed early in the morning, my plans were ruined, my teacher's mad at me what else? Oh yeah, my cast was crying their make-up off. 30 minutes before the actual run of the play and everything felt like a mess for me. I just told myself that once this play is over, the rest can come back to where it was going.<br /><br />I was nervous during the last 2 minute preparation. Though all the heavy heart I was bringing disappeared when I heard the first laugh from the audience because of the performance. As the play kept on going, the number of the audience increased and the laughs became louder. Then it struck me. Is my teacher getting pissed with what I've [we've] done worth the laughs of more than a hundred people watching the comedy right now?<br /><br />The play ended and I heard alot of '<em>nakakatawa to', 'na-enjoy ko to', 'ang galing ni teban', </em>and<em> </em>'<em>thanks. gumaan loob ko sa play.' </em> It was heartwarming and I. myself, was laughing inside the sound booth.<br /><br />I&nbsp;just hope that the last three weeks of school don't end up spoiling my thrid year in high school. Losing my spot in being a consistent honor student is nothing compared to being remembered by people as who I am as a person. And I do not want to end the year with someone getting the wrong idea of who I and my friends are.&nbsp;<br /><br /></font></span><span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 128);""><font face=""trebuchet ms""> <strong><em>Shit happens because we make it happen.</em></strong></font></span><font face=""trebuchet ms""><strong><em> </em></strong><br /></font>"

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"">I think I'm getting over excited - or worried - about the play tomorrow. Finally, after 2 grueling quarters of those bloody blocking rehearsals, DOTA can finally rest and end the school year after tomorrow's play. Personally, I think that what we're doing tomorrow is suicide.<br /><br />First of all, the club hadn't performed an official technical rehearsal. So if we're gonna lay out the sounds tomorrow and if it doesn't sync with the act, everybody's gonna be shot. Second, I'm having doubts on the lighting effects tomorrow. There's a 50- 50 chance that the audience would be visually bored 'coz there isn't any scene fit to have colored spotlights. Third, if the acoustics fail our play, who knows what I'll do to that Auditorium as soon as everybody gets out of there.<br /><br />What's more is that tomorrow's schedule would be full of quizzes and the sort. 2 quizzes in AP&nbsp;and Chem then a SW in math, practical test in Health. God, everything's piling up.<br /><br /><strong><em>I pray that everything would turn out fine tomorrow.</em></strong><br /><br /><br /></span><br />"

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"">I'm very temperamental and I still feel purple. It sounds as if I'm sick when I'm not. I'm acting like I'm sick when those around me are. I've been having mood swings lately and my tongue's getting pretty sharp everyday. And when my tongue get's sharp, my head floats like balloon.<br /><br />Then, I'm in my own world feeling no emotion at all. I'm just there. It's like what drug addicts and alcoholics say, &quot;When you're high, ya can't feel anything. That's when you start feeling happy.&quot; The worst part about that empty 'happiness' is when you're bubble has burst and you fall on the ground with your sharp tongue spearing you through the deep ground. Imagine how it would hurt if it literally did happen.<br /><br />I'm probably feeling a little prideful of myself. The thought that you can be perfect at something when you're totally a failure. How a delusion can feel so comforting although it irritates the hell out of you once you notice you're just deluding. It's funny how the brain works to make you feel good about yourself.<br /><br />And then comes my giddy side. I'd be giggling over something trivial and I vulgarly laugh at a corny and totally unfunny joke. At times I find being giddy a stress reliever. Laughing out the heavy part inside. Though I can see at times how I can annoy myself and others when I get giddy. Yeah, 'coz when I get giddy, I forget how to think. I'd do stuff that would make me laugh more. Worst scenario is when someone asks me a question, I'd go, HUH?!<br /><br />After I get tired of being giddy, I get serious. The thing about being serious is that most of the people I know would say that I'd put on a face that's very intimidating. The funny part about it all is that I'm not trying to put any mask on. I'm actually resting my facial muscles so I try not to put any kind of expression. The downside of getting serious is that my mind tends to rest and my eyes start to droop to sleep. This usually happens after 12 noon and lasts until 3 pm at most. One of the main reasons why I'm having problems with Chemistry.<br /><br />The best part about me I can say is when I get angry or pissed off. Why? I dunno. First reason probably is because it's the time I get to have the clearest reception of what's going on in my head. Notice my blog posts of last year. Most of them were written when I was as the peak of irritation. Second reason is maybe the people around me tense up and I can feel they're waiting for me to blow up or something. Attention-seeker you may say, but no. I'm not after the attention. I'm after the part when everybody's being cautious around me. By then, I go back to being a lion that's prideful enough to start another delusion. Freaky cycle.<br /><br />Now that it's hell week, I can't wait to see more of what my mood is capable of doing. <br /></span><br />"

Who wouldn't? Those were what greeted us before we even went out of that boiling piece of moving metal. Mostly the reason why I was amused with all the guys who came with Ida, Geca and I. Their necks were craning like ostriches the whole time and I'd begin imagining how it would be like if my brother were already in their shoes. Hell, I can't&nbsp; even imagine him talking to his crush. Haha. I'm the evil sister. Good for him, now that he knows how to sidecomment my outfit today at church. He's been hoping that I either break a heel or trip the stairs. <br /><br />Anyway, I can say that I enjoyed the soliloquies more than the actual excerpt of Shakespeare's plays. I was at the point of dozing off during Julius Ceasar when I couldn't catch the lines anymore. God, their English is excruciatingly good, no doubt about that but the act was kinda dull with the minimal use of actions and character movements.&nbsp;<br /><br />I liked their auditorium. It doesn't feel awkward to stay there for a good three hours. And unlike in Seton's infamous FBA Auditorium, Assumption's have good acoustics. You wouldn't tire your ears to hear what's going on the stage. I've learned alot that day and I hope I can put it to use especially on Friday's play. Golly, now that the year is ending, i'm feeling the rush going on at school. It's liek the teachers are throwing everything at us to finish within the remaining school year and it's piling up. <br /><br />Gelo won the raffle. He won a cap with the assumption on it. it was fun. Great experience. Their English is really intimidating to the point I would want to speak the thing myself.<br /><br />So the things that I have to look out for this week.<ol><li>British Parliamentary Debate</li><li>Sa Pula, Sa Puti Play</li><li>Profile for ADMU</li><li>CCF &amp; AP Reaction papers</li></ol>I really need topics to talk about.

"event","I never believed in the so-called Friday the 13th bad luck shit. I always thought it was some sort of prank to scare people into going home early on a Friday night. Anyway, I still don't believe in it. And since it's February and the 13th, there's this Pre-Valentine's 'celebration' happening here in school. Call me sour but I&nbsp;think it's all crap. Well, there's everyday to say that you admire somebody and 364 days/ chances of being romantic. <br /><br />Romance aside (I feel no love whatsoever), Today's also teacher's day when all of us dress up like teachers and teach the lower years. Fun experience but found it difficult at first. Appreciated Eng. Dept. very much! And then I got my feet all red from walking around the Mindanao Building in heels. My feet still feel sore BTW and probably the reason why I'm in a bad mood.<br /><br />And this bad mood ended up offending someone else. Yes, and I admit, I yet again, am the bad girl. The one with the sharp tongue. The <em>mataray and masungit</em> of the class. The brutally frank among the group. And all other stuff that you can blame on me. it's ironic 'coz I got into this 'fight' because of my tongue and then I've written in this assignment we have in CCF that says that I should respect in what others believe in, that we should not speak ill of others and so on, and I do this... this sin on the day I pass the assignment. <br /><br />It sucks when I forget and become the mindless hypocrite. It really sucks when it's hard to suck in PRIDE and say sorry. Though, it really doesn't suck when you know your 'right-ing a wrong.' And that's why I don't believe in Friday the 13th. It's because people make their own luck and only we, ourselves, can change it.<br /><br /><strong><em>Sorry seems to be the hardest word -- not!</em></strong><br /><br />"

"event","I'm in no mood to think hard about a really catchy title. I just thought of updating and reporting mostly on what happened during the past week. The outcome is generally good. Nothing really exciting but these are the times when too much can happen in a day. <br /><br />So I went back to school on Monday. I was pretty early, well just ahead of Daniel and a little later than Kuya Karl's time of arrival. We had this business planning seminar and competition in UP. We left school a little late 'coz the sun was already rising. We shared the L300 ride with representative students from ESS-South. 3 senior girls and 2 junior guys. Btw, one of them was good-looking =p. Anyway, the day turned out fun. UP Diliman Campus was really cold and I terribly enjoyed the large trees. I felt like I was back in Quezon and the tall coconut trees. Hehe. We ended up winning 3rd place while the cute pack from Clarette won the second and ESS- South won first because of their Skin changing shoe proposal. It was fun. We used the winning money to buy ourselves and Ms. Yves dinner from Mcdo. Poor people, we are. <br /><br />Then Tuesday came, I attended my classes still regretting not swimming in yesterday's PE class and enjoying everythign that happened the day before. I kept on daydreaming about the guy we met yesterday from South. It's been a long time since I looked up on somebody. Too bad he's snobbish 'coz I'm turned off =). I had alot of catching up to do and I got pretty freaked out with the laws of Sine and Cosine. Bummer 'coz I forgot to bring my calculator and I didn't get the chance to borrow from Penny 'coz Math was first period and I always come late to class. So i had to deal with the manual calculations. And then English came. It was my turn to report my book, A Tale of Two Cities. I never expected that after the report, I would get the chance to dig up and share my research with Rustio on Thursday.<br /><br />Wednesday came and I was really lazy to go to school since CCF was the first subject. I've already tried eating a really big breakfast and I've tried sleeping early the night before but I still was sleepy even after the documentary film on Exorcism. Everything there was really odd though not scary. Odd. Just odd. Chem was fun. We played with hydrochloric acid. It sure looked good when the acid reacted so quickly with magnesium. The reaction made with Zinc, though, smelled really bad. Anyway, I think that it was the only thing interesting that day. Ms. Nanette wasn't with us during English 'coz she was in a meeting. It sucked 'coz we had to answer a really long seatwork from the crummy old Grammar and Composition book. It was desperately bounded to prolong the lifespan of the book and it smelled, as usual, of mold. Then more boring subjects came and I had to endure opening my eyes through them all.&nbsp; Sure, I had to pay the teacher some respects though I was really happy when news came about that all SN members in SDS would be pulled out during Feasibility making time. Yeah, more time to sleep. Haha, though sleep never came. Had a meeting about us, juniors, working more with Sir Dan during the 4th issue since the seniors would be busy with graduation and everything.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thursday was quiz day for both math and chem. Good outcome with chem. Not so good with Math. Then had a really sleepy Computer session. It was weird 'coz Ms. GK has been teaching us for almost two years now and it was on that Thurday when she felt really nervous and intimidated by us. I told her it might be because the class was unusually quiet. She quite agreed to my statement. Went home at around 5. Arrived home with the sun still up. I got lots of time to spare and waste. i got to watch American Idol while dinner was being prepared and a little nap on the side. Then I went to work and I submitted the Ap report to Daniel just in time.<br /><br />Today was a boring and a suckish sort of day. I really didn't feel Health. Everything that happened felt like an OK-Whatever feeling. We were all taught how to do CPR and the &quot;Hamlick&quot; maneuver. Then came English. We reviewed ourselves with Verb Tenses and Patrick called me &quot;Little Miss Nanette.&quot; Very Funny Patrick =p. Call me weird but I can still hear his really mocking voice. Then we used 10 minutes of Math to review for the SBA then I slept the whole period. It felt good sleeping. Thanks to Propan vitamins. Hehe. Homeroom came and I felt really bad about attending Futsal practice. I still hadn't talked to Sir Anton since the really ugly failure that happened to the girls' team. I've been evading all possible eye contact and even during Sn time, while I was buyin food, when he approached my right I totally froze. God, I can't get over the shame. It's like Taekwondo all over again. I always lose in Taekwondo competitions and my coach gives me this piercing &quot;your fault&quot; kind of look and I remember everything all over again looking at him. Golly, it gives me the creeps. Even after dismissal, I've been very cautious in going down the staircase near&nbsp; the SUH kaing sure never to look at the hall on my right. It looks as if I am a paranoid. Well, yeah I am , sort of. When I finally shook off the idea, it was already during the batch meeting with Sir Martin and Sir Peter.<br /><br />We all listened to them voicing out what has become of us. I feel bad that I couldn't sympathize much with them 'coz I wasn't in the mood to feel the sadness but I understand them somehow 'coz I remember the time that my dad gave me this glare 'coz I destroyed the 10, 000 riyadh electronic dictionary he gave me. And the two even cried. It was really touching that there are still teachers who act as parents really dedicated to us mischievous kids. Though I pity them in a way. It's like why would they have to love the kind that's gonna hurt them? Why would they have to shed alot of their tears to strangers like me who doesn't really know that there are people who aren't blood-related that care and love? I'm grateful that I've got to know them and somehow, I've realized today that in the wrong things that I have done that do not seem to affect me, it affects the people around me, like it or not. Really, it is here in Seton that I have learned that humans are social beings. Since grade 3, I've been exposed to the 1 wrong, everybody's fault rule. It never changes. And until now, I still can't see the value behind that. I am trying to understand and only time can make me. I just can't wait to get out of that 3-walled classroom forever and see for myself what it feels to be in the shoes of the people shedding blood and tears for me. =D<br /><br />Until now, I still feel giddy about Monday's experience. <strong><em>Cafe Antonio</em></strong><br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br />"

The last two tries got the whole thing erased so now, as a spontaneous resolution, I've decided to use notepad for all my post starting today and onwards. I'm also gonna make a folder just for the sake that none of my damned posts get deleted while I try to stick them on the web. Yep, my temper meter is on high and I'm ranting when I should be greeting everybody now that it's the holidays. <br /><br />Where was I? Oh yes. I got a little tummy sick this Christmas so my Christmas Post has been joined with my New Year's Greeting post. Now, I have to do a single post. Well, saves me the time though all the really specific details get scratched. I got a little tummy sick 'coz I think Christmas bewitched me for not being in sync with Christmas gluttony. It's my first time to not delve too much with food 'coz I thought it'd get me out of trouble at least until the New Year's. Was wrong yet again. The thing got me looney the whole weekend. It even got to the point where my mind came flying off me and I'd be putting off my schedule for posting the events in my Holiday. Now that I think of it, last time I posted pictures in my Multiply account was two days after the School's Christmas party. <br /><br />Speaking of the Christmas Party, it went better that I expected it to be. I really wasn't hoping much on that day knowing what happened the past few years I've spent in my slowly rotting school. Yeah, I always speak bad of the school when it comes to management. Anyway, I had fun and those foot stockings really helped. Lessened the blisters. I made it through the night. <br /><br />Christmas was a blast. I was feeling really crappy the day before Christmas. Y'know with dad around and the swinging attitude. Though I was taken aback during midnight when we got open the gifts. I got a new watch and the presents my friends gave me were awesome. Though I got a really bad headache on Christmas Day. It then developed into the bad stomach I was telling you about a little earlier. It was really swell, having to deal with a growling stomach when you're actually full besides the fact that you're in a public area, namely Greenbelt, surrounded by all sorts of people. [note the sarcasm] And it was when we went home that I started regretting I had a really sensitive tummy. *curses tummy*<br /><br />I was praying last Saturday that the tummy ache would go away 'coz the family had to go to Bulacan the next day to celebrate the wedding of my dad's friend. My dad's getting <em>old</em> 'coz he was one of the married couple's Principal Sponsors. Yeah, he got to sit with all those old ladies wearing those elaborately embroidered blouse and skirt that made their skin look darker, wrinklier and more like the crypt keeper. Well, I couldn't imagine myself as one of them yet.<br /><br />The Lord answered my prayers and I got to go with them to Bulacan. Honestly, I really had to go...'coz I bought new shoes just for the occassion. *Grins* My tummy was still sensitive as it still is that I only got to drink water during the reception. So there. After the really fast recption, we scooted off so we could get out of Bulacan just in time before the traffic starts building up. Got a good sleep in the car. <br /><br />The next few days became slow. It was like the world wanted me to savor everyday of the last few days of 2008. As in, I stayed cramped up here at home, watching tv the whole afternoon flicking one channel to the other. Being bored. trying desperately to finish the book I'm gonna use for my book report. or just goof off with my dogs. Yeah, it was a slow 7 days. <br /><br />New Year's Eve came. Still with the fear that New Year might bewitch me with another though excruciating tummy ache. Had dinner with a few family friends. Tried holding a baby but it cried- probably scared of my face. I don't know. Got a little disappointed with it. Tried cooling off with Transformers. Then the fun began when the guests left at 930. Started lighting some fireworks. One by one then two then as midnight drew closer, the more excited electrons flew up to the sky. It was fun laughing while lighting an explosive. Totally made up for the non-explosive new year last year. <br /><br />Now's day 2 of 2009. I still woke up with my room spinning around me, literally. That's why I'm currently forcing myself into wearing glasses. I'm having these brain shakes again. That's what I call them. 'Coz that's how they appeal to me. Morning brain shakes. And any sudden movement with my head then everything in front of me seems to shake along with it. Haven't told my mom. Might just be scolded agian for not using glasses. So there. Brain Shake. <br /><br />This post is pretty long enough for me to lose the appeal of reading it again. Ever. I'll try to not get sick so I could update a little more frequently. Not that I was to lose interest in writing but I'm having doubts on what to write that's why sometimes, it's just good to make a blog without anybody trying to read it. Yeah, that was the main reason why I made this blog. No name. No Alec at first so that I could say whatever I wanted without staining a name but the username/ pen name I've created. But I couldn't stand hiding. Dunno why. My mouth is always too big to fit <em>my</em> secrets. Anyway, I think this topic is for another day to discuss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><em><strong>Happy New Year!</strong></em><br /><br />"

"event","I'm done reading Mark Haddon's A Spot of Bother and boy, I enjoyed reading the book. The reviews pasted on the book's front cover deserved to be there after all. Yip, can't get over the characters. They all just seemed true to life. It was a book well written with all the cuss words and the graphic description...Sparkly and Colorful

So now, I've started reading A tale of two cities by Charles Dickens, which I've decided would be the book that I'm gonna have to report next year. It was boring at the beginning 'coz the intro was tediously written so I decided to slack off a bit 'coz it's Christmas Eve. I'm currently wasting my time watching cheap Korean and looney American movies.&nbsp; I just want to give myself a rest. God, the book worth 50 pesos is wigging me out. The line-spacing is so thin that I've been either reading the same line 5 times in a row or skipping a line and getting confused with what's happening in the story. And that's with my glasses on. No offense to Charles Dickens.

So now, I have no idea what else to talk about. Not a thing to rant about. Just the book. Nothing more, nothing less. Oh, and while I was reading a spot of bother, I thought of, y'know, why not write my own book and make other people rant about it in their blogs too. Though I did some thinking and I said to myself, &quot;Screw writing, can't even stand reading a novel that's a classic&quot;. So bam, things went back to what I've said earlier. Waste my time in cheesy cheap movies."

"event","Waking up from a dream that has something to do with upcoming Intrams makes me sick. Why? It's because until now, I can't get the damned dream off my head. In the dream, the P.E. Department had finally given the batch time to meet and organize the line-up of games. The weird part was that the meeting place was in the school's elementary building AVR. It sorta sucked 'coz more than 250 of us were cramped inside considereing the fact that we were big for that room. Then Sir Anton just came popping into the dream holding a manual on how to organize an intramurals complete with the mechanics of different games and the player line-up form. Micha and Mika were also in the dream. I remember them being with me scouting for player in futsal when poof, the scene changed into a soccer field that looked more like Patrick's garden. God, it was so weird because familiar faces were there and they lined up like a firing squad then there was Luisa's soccer ball being mercilessly killed by one of those familiar faces. Don't know the name really. Then I came running up to the ball. I tried kicking it but I ended up sliding 3 times. It was weird 'coz the ground was grassy and dry. Then when I got up and looked back, I saw Ms. Nanette ready to kick the ball. Another familiar face threw the ball towards Ms. N and she kicked it. The ball flew halfway through the other side of the court. Freaky dream.<br /><br />I woke up 'coz mom was shaking me. I ignored her going back to sleep knowing that the night before was like hell. I'm sleeping in my room but not in my bed. I got to sleep on the floor last night 'coz mom came in at around 11 saying she's sleeping with me 'coz she can't sleep with dad's ear-cracking snore. Well, it is true 'coz his snore does reach my end of the room may the door be opened or closed.&nbsp; So now, I don't really understand if I'm still in my sleepy dream state or if my eyes are just tired. <br /><br />I'm plan to read the book I'm currently reading (A Spot of Bother) the whole day so I could finish it sooner. I have to move on to the next book so i can make my book report early afterwhich I get extra time to read Twilight [Thanks to Charmaine!]<br /><br /><em>I think I gotta write more 'coz my grammar is starting to rot. = (</em><br /><br />"

My schedule was fully packed that I literally had no time to do my assignments properly. I thank God that today's a No class day! <br /><br />Anyway, I really made it a point to blog everything out because I just felt like sharing. I'll start with what happened last Friday night.<br /><br />It was a so-called girl's night out. Almost all of us girls in&nbsp;SDS watched Twilight last friday. And it was fun considering Mika coming along with me to ATC, arriving there before the others and coming inside the movie house later than expected. <br /><br />So when Mika and I arrived, we decided to go window shopping to pass the time. I think we've roamed the whole mall waiting for the others to arrive. We've even tried BHing. Then we saw Mitch with his dad and Mika saw Eula V. then there were alot of chatting then sharing then drinking of shake. When we got hungry, we ate at KFC. It was then we met with Joanne, Alexa and Alyssa. After having a rushed meal, we proceeded to the movie house. We came in approximately 2 mins. after the movie started. Then the show began. The fun part about watching the movie was when I got to laugh my ass off 'coz whenever they get to see Edward on screen, everybody else screams, swoons and just goes crazy over the guy. Well, I was the ignorant one in the group 'coz I had to consult Mika with the &quot;Who's that, Is he the one?&quot; questions. It was a bit humiliating but I was really stubborn. I told myself that I wouldn't read the book until I get to see the movie. I've been hearing before that those who read the book got &quot;disappointed&quot; when they saw the movie. God, it was a good thing their rants didn't go overboard or i would've shoved this words onto their faces. <em>Well, duh, it is a movie. Movies are different from books and it is technically</em> <em>impossible to fit a whole book into one movie. <br /><br /></em>After the movie, the others went straight home though some had to wait for their parents to fetch them. So I stayed with yssa, lexii and jojo. Had fun at Starbucks. Though I was the only one who didn't buy anything. Wasn't in the mood to drink anything that'd deprive me of sleep. FGS, I had to wake up early the next day so I really had to sleep well that night. So there were some issues that we had talked about.<br /><br />The next day, Saturday was BAYLAYN day. I had to wake up early in the morning, fully waking up with paramore's decode music video. MTV rocks early in the morning, great eye opener [literally]. Stopped by Shell for gas and Jollibee for food then we were off to Seton. <br /><br />&nbsp;I&nbsp;arrived at school relieved that I wasn't left behind. I was surprised, too, 'coz Mitch and Ryan were there with some other year levels. They were all in uniform ^^. i think they had some Math Competition. Anyway, we used the L300 of Seton and it was quite noisy considering my witch like laugh echoing in the van. We were dropped at Taft and those in uniform had some other place to go. So we had a peek inside DLSU and then we went to McDo, which was beside La Salle. The others ate breakfast while I&nbsp;was scanning the newspapers from Jollibee. Ironic ei? When we were heading back to the campus, I saw different people with different uniforms. And yeah, i expected them to be the ones we were gonna be with for the whole day. <br /><br />The whole BayLayn activity was held at their new building [Bro. Andrew (insert last name) building]. The interior really looked nice. I had the chance to peek at one of the classrooms. It was amazing. Unlike Seton, DLSU wasn't selfish to put up LCD projectors in every classroom and having the whole building under centralized airconditioning. (Mwahahaha!)<br /><br />So bla bla goes the seminar that didn't have any relation to the actual competition. It was sorta weird even the seminar on Journalism Ethics. It was confusing on one part. Then the competition for Features writing was held in their computer lab. The desktop was pretty neat considering it was in flash format. To briefly describe how I felt during the contest, all I could say was that my hands were shaking against the keyboard and I wasn't expecting that they'd even consider reading my piece. <br /><br />So after the contest, we went back to the conference hall. Had a vain emo picture taking session with Sir Martin. Very Very funny. Then we settled at the back, huddled into the circle on the floor and created our own world talking about Charice Pempengco, monkeys, bananas, and La Salle's bad organizing habits [though they were rich and hospitable enough to serve good food].<br /><br />Then was the announcing of winners. Bla bla bla. Then we went home. We had to go around the whole school to get to the L300. the guards were really strict. They didn't allow us to pass through 'coz we didn't have IDs provided by APP. The ride home was depressingly quiet despite the fact that three out of the four of us won in our different categories. *Sigh*<br /><br />Then came Sunday, i was in a good mood 'coz I slept really really well the night before. It was Daniel's Day that day. It was his oratorical Contest. I came to watch and Iman was with us going there. Even if Dani didn't win, and i was inwardly bitter towards the one who won [so ambitious of being the next Priminister of the philippines, WTF?! ],I still felt proud of Daniel. He didn't falter, he didn't forget his lines. He did it well.&nbsp;<br /><br />So that was what my weekend was all about. <br /><br /><em><strong>-for feature writing, first place goes to... WTF?!</strong></em><br /><br />"

"event","The day couldn't get any worse. Golly, I was late for school today and it sucked. Well, it was not because we had to do the assembly 4 times in row, but the fact that I arrived at my TLE class only 25 minutes before it ended. The fun part was that I took the quiz knowing that I'd hardly finish it and the whole thing bugged me 'til this evening. Everything else went fine after except for PE. Every meeting gets worse and i thanked God that today was the last meeting for the quarter. Could you imagine, the teacher would tell us to do a triple long jump and a running long jump without showing us first or demonstrating step by step how to execute it properly? I was so pissed off that I didn't give a damn on how I did during the practical test. Although my constant sneering resulted to a 22-21 over 25 grade, I didn't care. I hated the fact that her unsafe way of teaching could lead into really dangerous accidents in the future.&nbsp;<br /><br />I remember that the last time I ranted about the teacher was when I hurt myself during hurdles and how we never really warmed up every meeting. It makes my blood boil thinking of that day.<br /><br />So anyway, another thing has come. I've just received unclear messages that work has been passed on to me yet again. this means another hectic day for me tomorrow. <br /><br /><em><strong>Let's keep it all coming...<br /><br /></strong></em>For the first time, I'm not in the mood to rant when I should be.<br /><br />"

"event","...because you might just get it. Mwahahaha!<br /><br />Well, what seemed to be a rant during lunch time became a reality after. I was asking for stress and I go it, again. At first I was condemning myself for being unable to lend a hand in the play in the Filipino. Now, I've reached the position of production Manager. It sounds like a fun job but it's not. It satisfies my need for stress. It satisfies my need to be busy. <br /><br />So anyway, i just had the need to blog. I haven't written in so long that when I tried making the first draft of the oratorical for daniel to orate in some BCBP competition, I ended up with putting together juvenile words and the whole piece lacked transition. Thanks to Iman, Gil, Daniel and Islau, the speech looked better when i passed it to ms. nanette this morning. Now I really understand why grammar is considered as a skill. <br /><br />Anyway, I also wantred to share that the English play, shakespeare's&nbsp; a Midsummer night's dream was a success that I was so happy on the job done. If I could see it again in video. Hahahah! Now, we're gonn have a filipino play. OMG sleepless nights are coming, baby!<br /><br />So that's what's been happening for now. I'm gonna attend a seminar next saturday in DLSU-M organized by the Pahayagang Plaridel. there's a competition after the seminar and I hope that I do well on that day. I wouldn't want a really good opportunity go to waste. And Yeah, even now, i suck at paragraph transitions. Hahaha!

"event","my head was about to crack this afternoon. I couldn't stand the pain that's why I gave upt just a while ago and drank mefanamic acid. I was totally rolling on the floor and I couldn't even force myself to sleep the headache off. God, it was awful. Though, despite that, I got to watch the dark knight after a really really long time. I've done the CCF assignment, the AP financial report, and I've finished the prompt script in English.<br /><br />But before all the things that's supposed to happen this week. I just wanna say my view on The dark knight. I think everyone would kill me for this but what the heck. I love going aginst what most people think. <br /><br />I think that heath ledger sucked at the movie. I didn't find him outstanding or anything in the movie. I even noticed that his accent was going off his character at the near end of his movie. Really, I was expecting something really good from what I've heard from my classmates. I guess the only things I appreciated about his character was his laugh 'coz we shared the same kind and his make-up 'coz the eyes were really cool. Mwahahahaha! I hated batman's voice. Golly, it was like he wasn't talking anymore. The more he tried to make his voice husky, the more air-like was the sound of his voice. *Sigh* I thank myself that i've watched this movie a long time later 'coz if I had seen this when this was hot, I might have been killed already by heath's fans. ^_^<br /><br />So moving on, it feels good that my head doesn't hurt anymore. It's like my head has been out of a storm. I can actually think clearly now. Though the sort of bad part is that I keep on thinking about what's gonna happen this week. Yes, this is going to be hell crazy and let's add in on the fact that I'm a Seton Notes staff/ News Editor. Meaning, everything that's gonna happen this week, I have to make sure somebody's gonna have to monitor it. See? I'm gonna be cut in half. And I haven't even done my final draft for the short story in filipino and the research in the victorian era is still not complete. I still have to call for a meeting regarding the report's &quot;theme&quot; Ugh. I hope things turn out well 'coz I don't want to sleep late. I'm actually killing myself slowly everytime I sleep past my bedtime. <br /><br />Oh yeah, I wanted to share how pissed off I was during the mass today. We went to mass just there beside our house and I didn't enjoy it. For crying out loud, I couldn't pray 'coz all that was racing in my mind were curses. Man, the priest was clearly sermoning everybody about how we all should behave inside the church and for some reason, the adults were evidently not paying attention. They were clearly, letting their children run wild inside the chapel stepping and bumping into me and into other people standing in the back. The ironic part was that the gospel was about jesus getting mad at the people in the temple 'coz they were making the place a market and all the churchgoers around me were standing up and sitting, going out and coming back holding a plastic filled with softdrinks. My blood was boiling to the point I had lost my concentration on praying and the appetite to take communion. I was so mad that if I had taken all the guts that I had, I would march up to the commentators podium and say all that the priest has been saying in the most brutal and colloquial manner with all the cusses that I could think of to make that bitter speech more bitter. My mind was filled with so much venom at the time that when I went home, I right away swore really badly. Golly, the people here have no shame for the Lord. It sucks when you get to face the disappointing reality of things. <br /><br />Because of this and some other things that happened a while ago, I've realized that I don't know how to feel sad. Today, It's either I feel happy or I get angry about things. Weird but true. I just hope I wouldn't get another headache tomorrow. <br /><br /><strong><em>~~Done at 10:46pm</em></strong><br /><br />"

"event","I can't say that what happened today was special nor lucky. All that happened today just felt right, even the fact that I still can't accept what I did to my Math quiz. ^_^ Though, I haven't thought until now that I've learned many things today just by listening around me and sharing what I already know with friends of mine. <br /><br /><em>I haven't thought...</em>that the evaluation would go as smoothly as it did this morning. Yeah, I was expecting more bloody comments and all. Though, most of what I heard was that we needed to improve mostly on the part of the actors and from the last major dry-run that we had, we seemed to improve (from what I've heard). it's quite flattering on my part that the fairies don't look like chickens anymore. It made me think a bit this afternoon and ideas came swooning inside my head. Yeah, I've finally visualized properly&nbsp; the remedies to the flaws that they've been telling me the play has been having. It's like, I see what's wrong but my mind gets blocked until someone really comments on it. Hahaha. I'm foolish and weird. Now, I'm getting myself worked up on the things that I want to fix. Sue me.<br /><br /><em>I haven't thought...</em>that I'm so lucky to have been blessed with really smart parents. I was talking to Abby during AP&nbsp;time since the whole hour was given to the class so that the others could practice for the Samba. So we were talking about anime and manga and we came to the point of talking about my parents. She was asking how it was in our home and if I was scolded or grounded or of the sort. No, I told Abby. I told her how things were run in the house. I said that I was never hit by my parents nor grounded but in every mistake we make, they give sermons that, well attack my insides. In fact, as I was telling Abby she was sorta amazed. i was puzzled for a while so I asked why she had that amazed look on her face. She then told me that what my parents did was cool. She said that they attacked 'the minds.' I asked, How come?. She told me, from what i've told her, that my parents sorta make us learn by ourselves and twist our minds and all into understanding the consequences of our actions and to what kind of a person it makes us. It's kinda vague, really so I'll share what happened yesterday.<br /><br /><em>So yesterday, my brother suddenly called me from the other room saying that I should bring down his PC. Well, to me, his tone was sort of an order and I was doing something on my computer at that time so I got a little pissed off. So I did help him but half-heartedly did it. On his part, which I still don't understand, he was having his &quot;princely act&quot;, being a se&ntilde;orito and all that. So technically, the both of us looked pissed off while doing the job of transferring the components. Then mom kinda noticed the pissed off look on our faces and my brother was sort of slamming the keyboard and mouse on the desk downstairs. So my mom got pissed too. [It's weird, we all kinda got pissed] So she said what's the use of bringing it down with the sour look on our faces. So she told us to bring it back. i on the other hand, got a little more pissed 'coz I brought down the CPU and monitor already and she'd want us to brign it back up. So I had no choice to bring it back up. At that time, I was starting to argue with my brother on this and that and all about bringing down the comupter. So it ended there and continued when my dad arrived. I caught mom telling dad what happened 'coz I was on my way to pee. Yeah, wrong timing really. Then dad asked me what happened. i told my side of the story and this he said,</em> &quot;You're older than your brother. 4 years older. 4 years smarter. Do you think he'd see you as an older and respectable sister if you're lowering yourself to his level and hot-headedly argue with him?&quot; <em>It kinda pierced me right through but it was still true. He added,&nbsp;</em>&quot;You should be the one to understand him. Try to act the cool one 'coz he;s the type who wants what he wants there and then&quot;<em> </em><br /><br />So in the end, we brought down the whole PC including the table. Well, after what Abby said, I've realized that yeah, my parents are my lawyers-at-home. And I feel good about it. Somehow, I get to learn on my own getting a few sermons here and there but not really the soap opera type when they all scream at each other. Well, I do get pissed off when i get scolded but after that I kinda realize that I learn from it later on. <br /><br /><em>I haven't thought...</em>that I'm gonna be the bad girl again. I hate to break it but my urge to go against the opinions of others are starting to build up. <strong>There are many stupid people in the world. </strong>Well, mostly the people today love to blog about the judgementals. No, I'm not the type who hates the judgementals. Technically, we all are judgemental, deny it or not. I just hate the stupid people. Well there are many definitions of stupid that's why I like the word. I'm not talking academically but street-wisely. <br /><br />I mean yeah, you're really a good speaker and all but please, don't try preaching when you yourself can't do it. It's kinda smart really, preaching through a campus paper or simply one's own blog but please don't use the i'm-sorta-part-of-this-preach-but-i'm-forgetting-the-I-in-it-thing. It's kinda stupid really 'coz it goes to show that, well, you yourself aren't ready to change to prove what you're preaching. (See, I'm being the bad girl, now) What else I hate about stupid people? Oh yeah, jumping to conclusions and making really unnecessary comments that offend the beliefs of other people. Actually, I'm doing it right now, the unnecessary comment part. Though, I'm not jumping to conclusions. Honey, I read study who I'm facing before using the gun I'm gonna use to shoot. Well yeah, I got your point though try to make sure who you're facing, really. The real question is, Have you got the right ammo?&nbsp;<br /><br />Ironic, 'coz it sounds to me I'm criticizing myself and going against it again. I myself am getting confused. Though, I think you get my point. All I'm saying is that why not get geared up with the right stuff before firing the shotgun? <br /><br />Ugh. I'm getting a bit vague here. <br /><br /><em>I haven't thought... </em>that I'll be up to the point of ranting about something I abhor that I unconsciously do. Really, why does psychology get this twisted? I can just shut up and get indifferent here but no, I wanna be a stupid person just like everyone. Come to think of it, either way, I'm still part of it. If you get me, do you agree, I'm weird, right?<br /><br /><em>I haven't thought.. </em>that after being so worked up to make this post, I suddenly lost my taste to continue this post. Yeah, I think I've already let it go. I think that this is enough.<br /><br /><em><strong>~~everything I abhor, everything I've been doing.</strong></em><br />"

"event","One day, there was this conservative pervert who laughed like a witch. She had a friend who was a nagger and they clicked very well. ..<br /><br /><br />Hahahaha! If I would continue this story, It'd turn out to be great. Sadly, I'm too lazy to put on symbolism. So I'd do it the crude way. So today was really really great despite getting a really really pass-ing grade in math. I'm gonna make sure I&nbsp;get it this time on the quiz. So anyway, everything went smoothly today even the English rehearsal.<br /><br />Seriously, the whole play has improved. I&nbsp;mean, the only thing that I'm supposed to worry about is the sounds 'coz we've tried the lighting and what's left is the timing. The actors have been blocked already and ms. nanette polished it. The props were already set and they're currently placed at the FBA Lobby. We just left a sign there saying &quot;no one should touch whatever stuff in there.&quot;<br /><br />Yeah, I enjoyed today even if I was smaked at the head twice, called a pervert a couple more times, commented on having a witch's laugh and getting all Seton's dust bunnies in me after rolling on the floor laughing my heart out during the rehearsal. Yep, I can say today was a great day. We were even baptized as the batch who produced a production with a really noisy technical team. Mwahahah! My voice is louder than of the actors. LOL! LMAO!<br /><br />Today was fun and I think I've been repeating the same line since the beginning of my post. Notice that when I'm pised off, writing seems easy to do ang really fluent. When I'm really really happy, my writing gets redundant. Harharhar!<br /><br />So to make this post longer, I've decided to include the stuff I'm pondering on.<ul><li>English Play</li><li>Teatro Play</li><li>Filipino Short story</li><li>SN</li></ul>So with the english play, yeah, same as before, the day fo evaluation. It's kinda making me nervous but I'm confident the whole class can do it. Then the Teatro play. I haven't edited the script again. Golly. I'm being lazy with DOTA. Shh. But I'll find my motivation sooner or later. Then there's the FIlipino shortstory. No, I'm not complaining about it being extended to Tuesday. I'm happy that it was extended 'coz until now I can't think of areally really good plot. I want it to be so good that the heart of the reader would be shot straight. y'know there's a feeling of fulfillment once you know you've affected someone's life.<br /><br />So moving on, I'm really feelign bad about SN. It's all chaos. I dunno why but I feel resentful everytime I go inside the office nowadays. No, I don't resent joining the org but I resent my feet who bring me there if there are meetings. *Sigh*<br /><br /><em><strong>~.~ 11:09PM</strong></em><br /><br />"

"event","I am currently stuck on the last question in my Chem assignment. I can't seem to find the answer on the net nor in the book. Anyway, today was a really heavy day. Not to mention getting a sermon from our AP teacher and what's more is that it's our last subject today.<br /><br />Bummer really, getting yelled when you're really sleepy. Though the guy has a point. We do get dead silent in his class and even I don't know why. I can't say because some aren't in good terms with him really. Why, with other teachers even if we aren't in good terms, we still recite. It's with this teacher that's everything's different. A friend of mine even said that maybe it's in his aura that the class gets dead silent. I really can't blame him 'coz it is partly our fault. He's just doing his job. Although I think that his long speech was ruined when he was sort of in the tone of giving up and saying that he doesn't care anymore if we're still mad at him bla bla as long as he makes us recite...<br /><br />Anyway, what's done is done. Let's just see tomorrow what happens when the class is with him tomorrow. He's our third period and after English. So I half- heartedly think that we're gonna be silent once more. I just hope we change. It's kinda weird really. Being all quiet and stuff. Though frankly, the reason why I wasn't reciting was that I forgot almost half of what has happened and the only thing in my head during that time was <em>'Italy is shaped like a boot.' </em> See, what's to recite on that. I'm a dim-wit when it comes to geography. And the only thign that interests me in History is either current events or when the teacher talks about the great wars of the past. It's like I'm a sucker for action in this subject. <br /><br />I just hope things get into good condition tomorrow. Yeah, I'm gonna try to speak up. I don't want to continue a living a nightmare 'coz I have other better things to do and I wouldn't want a nightmare like this to ruin everything. Oh yeah, and there's this assignment we have in Filipino that we make an outline of our own story. Golly, I can't think of a good one right now. All I know is that I've got a setting already. Goodluck with me, right?<br /><br />Just to add, I've seen the pictures from the recollection and last Friday and I can say, my head looks like a big round balloon. LOL! Though, I got to laugh at myself and I felt better. <br /><br /><em><strong>~~Done at 9:57pm</strong></em><br /><br />"

Though I don't feel like sleeping yet 'coz my head is too hot to take some rest. <br /><br />I was ok just a while ago. Yeah, I was. If it wasn't for an IM that I received earlier sort of blaming me for the GMs that I have been sending. Well, I'm sorry if I've been rude enough to be flashing GMs on your computer screen but I don't regret doing it. God, it just goes to show that what I've heard about you was right. It was a good thing you went offline after your IM and Mika was good enough to tell me to stop or I would've shoved all that went racing through my mind at you.<br /><br />Yeah, what happened definitely ruined my day not to mention what happened during dismissal time. If I hadn't approached EIC at the CWS, we would all have been waiting for dust bunnies inside the office. God, to call for a meeting and then calling it off without even checking the office if there are any people waiting for you there. <strong>How unprofessional</strong>. Y'know I've been trying to be patient with everybody for so long that I've been holdign to say those words for a long time. This goes for everybody. These past few weeks, a day won't go by without me encountering an unprofessional goblin from our school. It triggers my allergies and I'm all out of anti-histamine. It sucks.<br /><br />Despite all that, I was really amazed with Ms. Nanette. It's like she's got magic that she can turn something plain and stiff into something so natural and spontaneous. Yeah, she helped us fix the blockings and all for the play. And I finally understood how to level the characters on stage. *Sigh* It feels good somehow.

"event","Yesterday was really tiring but it paid off. The experience was priceless. I got to see so much that I regretted leaving my camera behind. <br /><br />The group left past seven because Klarisse was late. LOL! It was a good thing that it wasn't traffic 'coz travel time was approximately 1 hour. So we spent the time exchanging stories and holding our laugh to giggles 'coz on the way to PETA, the 4th years were sleeping. We were about to sleep when we arrived. Yeah, we never realized that the talking took up most of the travel time. So we arrived and registered for the workshop we would want to join for the first three hours of the shedule. Thinking that I would learn how to design sets and prepare costumes, Abby, Celina and I applied for the Production Design Workshop. So the nametags were handed out and the chosen workshop was placed at the back of the ID. And yeah, my name was terribly butchered from the first name to the last name. Golly, PETA baptized me with a new name. <em>ALEESANDRA MENDIODA. </em>It was horrifying but then I'm used to it.&nbsp;<br /><br />So the group separated ways and went to the designated workshops. I was really looking forward into learning the technicalities in Production Design but I was frustrated 'coz all we did was draw our favorite food, a symbol of nature that represents ourselves and a map of our life. *Gah* Though, when I think about it, I can't blame them. Most of the participants were kids. As in children ages 7 to 12 were with us. I could count by hand those who joined Prod design workshop that were high school students. So I got so down about what happened that I skipped the workshop after lunch and the three of us hid inside PETA's theater and we watched the rehearsals of the different workshops. It was a bit boring and I was partly envious because they got to perform and the workshop I attended only had an exhibit at the second floor. When I was getting really bored, Ate Michelle called for me because we were to do SN business. <br /><br />It was really nice of Sir JM to introduce and let us interview a ventriloquist or a person who performs with a puppet and gives it his voice without opening his mouth. And because of that interview, I got to participate in his act. I placed tape on his mouth when his sidekick, the puppet, challenged the ventriloquist that the puppet could talk even if his mouth is closed. It was fun. While I was on stage, I couldn't see the audience 'coz the spotlights were blinding besides the fact that I have astigmatism.&nbsp;<br /><br />So after interviewing the ventriloquist, Ate Michelle and I went around the building taking pictures of the different stuff going on inside. We even asked a mime to pose at the building's entrance so we could get a good shot. Those mimes were actually people undergoing initiation. I think those guys wanted to affiliate themselves with PETA that's why they got themselves into those costumes. I even got my face painted with their make-up when a mime stuck her face on me when the both of us were taking pictures of ourselves. Naughty naughty mime. <br /><br />I'm not even halfway through... So then there had the presentation of the workshops and I got to see three plays in one sitting. It was AWESOME! I got so in love with the theme song for the festival and I got so engrossed with the play because of the lighting effect and the cute microphones hanging around the stage. Yeah, and there was also this kid who played in one of the plays and he looked liek Kevin's brother, Kenneth. It was really funny 'coz the kid acted so well that we were amused to the point when the cast was bowing, we gave him a standing ovation when he did a solo bow. Big WOW!<br /><br />So when it was all over, we took lots of pictures of ourselves at the entrance of the building then the others said goodbye to their new friends, the Assumptionistas, and one of the senoirs with us grabbed the chance of taking a picture with one of them. I think he even got her number. LOL! <em>Lakas ng trip!</em><br /><br />When we boarded the bus, we decided that we should order food so some of us went to KFC to buy food for everyone. It took us a while 'coz even Ms. Cha said that when she went to KFC&nbsp;that morning, the service was so slow. So while waiting, we exchanged stories and our experiences when we were in our workshops and all. When everybody boarded the bus and we were on our way back to Seton, we started exchanging stories from the PETA&nbsp;experience to the class discussion in school. We even reached to the point of talking about stuff and laughing our asses off about the times we encountered those stuff in school. That roadtrip home was really really hilarious and I thank all the people who were with me during that day. I haven't laughed that hard in a while.<br /><br />So I arrived home at around 930 pm. I jumped to bed 'coz I had to wake up at 2 am to accompany my dad into bringing my tita, tito and lola to the airport. So at two, I woke up and when I was in the car, I can't help but fall asleep again. Yeah, I was exhausted that when we arrived at home agian at around 330 am, I jumped back to bed still in my pajamas and fell asleep instantly. I woke up again at around 9am did the usual routine and I got to have a quick chat with my cousin Rafim. Golly, he speaks like an American. The accent and all. It was fun talking to him even through the internet. Hahaha! Yeah and due to that, things didn't go as planned. Instead of going to church at 11 am, we had mass at 4 pm. So basically, we spent the whole day with mom at the hospital. Yeah, I've realized that it&nbsp; really is uncomfortable sleeping in the hospital. It's so cold. Golly.&nbsp;<br /><br />So that's what happened mostly during the weekend. Exhausting really but the experience is worth it. =]<br /><br /><strong><em>What wood flies? &nbsp; &nbsp; --It's Plywood!

I sound so emo. Golly. Well, I've learned that life is not life when you don't get to feel any pain once in a while.<br /><br />So we had our first three dry runs today. All I can say is that the whole play needs a whole lot of improvement and I am very thankful that last year's 4-ZDN came with the SN alumni 'coz they motivated me with their comments. Ms. Mutya was right. With them, you'd never feel a total failure. They give the &quot;There's room for improvement&quot; aura and I love it. I also appreciate Ms. Nanette being so kind enough to move the final evaluation to the 4th of November. That gives me more time to think about how I'm supposed to improve the parts that need to be improved. Yeah, I feel like I'm in the Oscar's thanking everybody. LOL!<br /><br />On the other hand, there's Teatro and I have to edit the script again and give the new one out by monday so that everybody could start memorizing their lines. *Sigh* Just so you know, I still think that this is gonna be a bit hard for me 'coz our schedule is packed and we have to fit everything in so we gan beat the deadlines. *Sigh*<br /><br />So during futsal, I wasn't in my best mood to win. I was kicking the ball to where I wanted it to go but I had no intention whatsoever to win today. Though, I now know how to use my head and chest in controlling the ball! Woot! I was also not in my best mood during Mentoring 'coz I thought that we'd be practising for English until 540. Bummer that the whole class got so intimidated with CC's performance that they too decided to practice for Ap instead of the English play. So I got a little pissed off but it went away when another thing happened.<br /><br />Well, one of my good friends wasn't feeling so good this afternoon so a few of us brought him out to have some fresh air. After a while, another friend came out saying that the other friends left inside the gym were crying. I thought it was a joke or something so I shrugged the thought off and we made the friend go to the CR to change his shirt 'coz his back was wet. When Mika and I went to see what's going on with the people Practicing in Ap, I wondered why they were all scattered and hugging each other. They were crying and it made me more curious. I asked why and they told me it was about the friend. Mika was insisting what it was and she started to cry and it was contagiuous so I too started to cry. Yeah, it's my first time to &quot;catch a cry&quot;. So then, we went to the friend and asked him what he had and he was hesitating to tell us/me the truth. Note that tears were streaming down my face while I was extracting facts from him. Once I knew what it really was, it happened. It was the cry that gave me a sour look on my face and tears that couldn't just flow out of my eyes.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yeah, it really hurts to know when someone who's attached to you tells you the most unexpected thing that I&nbsp;have never imagined. Everything felt like a blur at that moment. I would cry then stop and then cry and hug some random perosn and hen stop again and then think about what I'm crying about and then cry and then stop. It was a swirl of events. I couldn't take seeing everybody's faces all red and puffy so when I heard the bell, I hurried out the campus and went to the car. I'm feeling a little better now I've written it out but there's still this thing that bugs me. It's like some fear of seeing the what ifs in life. Y'know when you get to think that everything in the future is going so well that you'd never imagine that the worst would come? Then once you realize that your perfect dream was shattered, you cry because you get shocked by the rality of it all.That nothing is perfect, constant nor forever.<br /><br />Then we went to the hospital to visit mom. She woke up when me and my bro were there though she still can't speak. I've noticed she was pale and I really hate the smell of alcohol and acid inside the hospital. So we spent the time there talking to her, testing her like, &quot;Move your finger is you hear me&quot;. Yeah, we were acting like the doctors we see in the discovery channel. i found it funny at first. And then mom called for dad and she wrote on a a piece of envelope that when they did the operation, she felt pain. Yeah, I was sort of eavesdropping while watching family feud. So then, my yaya texted me saying that the puppy looked weak and it looked like it was gonna die so I immediately called her saying that she should bring her to the vet. When I went home, I found out that Tiny had a broken leg and jsut now, she died. *Sigh* I don't think she can take the pain. God knows she'd live better with him up there. Long Live Tiny!<br /><br />*Sigh* Puppies are like my children. It hurts me when they die. So anyway, we had to go home and leave Mom and tita tashie at the hospital. I kissed her goodnight and while I was doing it, I felt the famous pang in my chest. I felt my eyes grow hot but I forced not to show anything but a smile. <br /><br />Now I'm here retelling everything trying to take away my heavy heart because I have to go to PETA tomorrow for the workshop. Yep, It's gonna be another tiring day tomorrow and I plan to make the most out of it. <br /><br /><em><strong><br />I said I didn't like people who put a smile on their face to hide the sorrow.

"event","This site is growing cobwebs already. That's why after making up my mind, I decided to write what I thought immediately. Just to update with what's happening, we're gonna have our recollection tomorrow and on friday, we're gonna do the dry-run for the play, A Midsummer Night's Dream. <br /><br />I'm not ready for our recollection tomorrow. Too much has been bothering me to the point that I couldn't accept what we were doing and discussing in CCF. Yeah, I couldn't accept it. I thought it had too many flaws to accept and I thought I was going crazy these past two days. The sad part about it is that the subject after (AP)&nbsp;gets affected. It's not only me really, the whole class gets dead silent from CCF down 'til AP. Yeah, it isn't me to be really quiet. It's just I have this tendency to shut up when I get too pissed off of something. I withdraw and keep my thoughts to myself. Now, I don't know how tomorrow will go. These past two days, the CCF teacher has been telling us to open up and let it all out during the recollection, take the risk and do this and that. Well, with what's happened this afternoon, I'm not sure if that'd be the case tomorrow.&nbsp;<br /><br />Frankly speaking, I do feel the tension inside the classroom everyday since I don't know when. It isn't plesant, i tell you. It's like when you talk to a classmate, you just see the cheerful facade but I can feel that there's something beneath that smile. It sucks 'coz there really are some who try to hide the truth with the mask. No, I'm not asking for the details of the drama you're facing. If you don't feel your best, don't try covering it with a smile. At least when your facing me. I'd prefer getting hurt like a slap on the face rather than being forced to look like the stupid one among everybody. Yeah, it feels like I'm living a lie with everything that's happened. I don't even feel the full presence of my <em>barkada.</em> I miss them. They're missing. We're all lost. <br /><br />To add the burden, I'm director of our class play, A midsummer night's dream (William Shakespeare), and Daniel is too. We're CO-directors. It's fun that way. Though, I've learned this is tough business. I dunno why but I get this tendency to be so loose with everybody. Like if they suggest to do this then I allow them. or if they should be doing stage business and not the actual <em>gossip exchange</em>, I leave them be. I let them do as they wish. I'm not on my annoyed and irritated bitch state... yet. What's more is that the dry run is on Friday and I've heard that ZDN, the pilot section that graduated last year, is gonna watch us. OMG. Now I'm nervous. Everthing's not smooth yet. I still feel that there's this choppy feel to the whole blocking of the play. Wah. I'm panicking when I know it's my fault. Yeah, I'm taking the blame. Well, Daniel's already a really good director but what about me? I'm someone who just wants to worry and challenge herself just for the heck of it that's why I took the job. *Sigh* I suck.<br /><br />See I'm not ready for the recollection? What's more is that SN stress is adding to everything. God, Top 1, 2 are asking from me the news articles and I've been asking the writers where there articles are. What's their reply? &quot;Oh, It's with me&quot;, &quot;Oh I can't find them&quot;, &quot;Oh, later, I'm too lazy. &quot; Ugh. Then quit if you're not committed enough to go up one floor and give your article to them!<br /><br />Furthermore, I'm not gonna see mom for some time this week until the next. I'm gonna miss her. =[<br /><br />Then just a while ago, I received an email invitation from a certain opinionated01 in multiply. Golly, whatever creature you are, I tell you, once I know who you are, you're getting it from me. You act as if you could influence me with the bribes that you've been copying, pasting and sending to everybody. You're a monster for crying out loud. You've ruined my mental preparation for tomorrow's recollection, you ass. <br /><br />So to sum everything up. I've come up with that title above because it hurts whne raindrops fall on my head. Just like what everything is happening around me, it hurts my head, stresses me out and gives me headcolds that really hurt. Yeah, I'm bathing under the rain right now. Bathing under the cold hard rain.<br /><br /><br /><strong><em>Drip. Drop. Drip. Drop. Ouch!</em></strong><br /><br /> <br /><br />"

Damn, I feel old and emotional. Golly, I'm listening to music older than my mom. For crying out loud, what's happening to me? Hay. I'm trying to change my mood right now and blogging, for the first time, seems to not help me. God, HELP! It's like my soul just wants to be weak right now. Hmm...

I can't imagine how I look now. Well, yeah I can see myself 'coz I've got two tall mirrors at my right right now, duh. I'm referring to the how I look attitude wise. I dunno if I'm still Alec. It's weird. I'm weird. I need rest. Or as Mitchell says it, &quot;Watch TV!&quot; LOL. Maybe I should watch tv! =]. But no, I don't like the shows that's going on at this hour. Gah, I'm doing a monologue.&nbsp; 

Anyway, I have something different in mind that I wanna share maybe tomorrow. It's part II. =]."

I don't know why but everytime I see him on TV, I scream the &quot;fangirl&quot; scream. I know he totally sucks at singing but Thank GOD He created Phil good-looking. Besides the fact that he's a hunk and football player, he's got a really hot smile. *Sigh* What's more is that Phil's got an older brother who's just as good-looking as him, James ^_^. Seeing the both of them on one screen is just like getting to see heaven. ^_^. If i could just meet them in person...<br /><br />The Younghusband brothers put aside, I've realized that there are things in life that are inevitable. irresistable. And since yesterday, I have accepted the fact that I'm a workaholic. I cannot resist not working. I cannot resist not being stressed. Being busy is just irressistable. Inevitable. I tend to worry about things that should'nt be made a big deal of. It's like my day wouldn't be complete if I don't fuss on something.<br /><br />The next thing I found irresistable is my ever changing mood. There would be times when I just blow my top off. I cannot hold my anger when I'm pissed off or control my laugh when I'm overwhelmed and happy. Yeah, it somehow looks as if I can't discipline myself in controlling my mood. Wah! I'm a wreck.<br /><br />Anyway, I can't keep my mood down especially now that I have loads of work to do. Instead of ranting, I thought of listing the stuff I can't resist not doing or having.<br /><ol><li>Chocolates are irresistable</li><li>James and Phil Younghusband are irresistable. LOL</li><li>I cannot resist not being signed on to my YM account</li><li>I can't resist not spending time with Good friends</li><li>Showing my affection for puppies is irresistable</li><li>I cannot resist taking my eyes off a dress that looks so good to wear.</li><li>I don't hesitate laughing my heart out if I find something funny.</li><li>PC is irresistable. ^_^ (Can't compare to the Younghusbands! LOL) </li><li>Books are irresistable</li><li>Technology is irresistable</li><li><em>&nbsp;</em>I can't resist not washing my feet after I wake up. (I dunno why but I can't wake up properly if I don't wash my feet)</li><li>Teasing people is irresistable. I can't let a day pass without teasing someone.</li></ol>That's it so far. Nyahahaha! i am out of my mind today. <br /><br /><br /><br /><strong><em>You're irresistable...</em></strong><br /><br />"

"event","Crossing a checked mark. Crossing a street. Crossing out an error. Crossing the limit. Crossing the lines. Oh, too much has happened today that made my temper cross the line both negatively and positively.<br /><br />First period Chemistry. I thought I was gonna be late. Golly, my blood was boiling as I was on my way up to the third floor. Good thing I arrived just before the ceremony started. And then the quiz came. I got a good partial score. i just hope I got to answer the quantum numbers correctly. So then after Chem was double period English. I enjoyed analyzing the poems but the part that I didn't enjoy much was when we got to make our own poems. Our group is going to make a metaphysical poem and i am really hoping we do a really really really good job despite the fact I got pissed off twice today already due to some unpleasant situations.<br /><br />Them came Computer. What happened really got me worked up the whole period. On my way to the Lab, I found out that Daniel's files were deleted by some unknown human. So, I tried checking my own to see if mine were deleted too. Due to some unfortunate reason, my whole folder was deleted too. Well, not only mine but most of the third year people who share the same computer as I. What's more is that we had two Hands-on activities and I had to write everything from scratch. It sucks 'coz while I was typing the first program, I accidentally pressed the POWER button on the keyboard. So my unsaved file was gone forever so I had to start all over AGAIN. God, it really pissed me off to the point I was cursing while typing the syntax. If it was a prank meant for the third year people using the unit I am using, it is ultimately not funny. Whoever the hell you are, I curse you to the pits of hell for erasing my files. May God damn you! And if I find out who you actually are, I swear, you will see the evil side of me.<br /><br />Anyway, once I was through with all the activities, I felt lighter. Then math came. I thought we were gonna have a seatwork. Good thing we didn't 'coz we discussed about proving. So after that was AP. We had a quiz and I liked it 'coz it had choices. So my head didn't suffer from trying to find the right Filipino words. Yep, I still have a hard time with super deep Filipino. <br /><br />Dismissal came and I was in the middle of reading the last few pages of Paulo Coelho's Eleven Minutes if not for Inna who took it. Eager to read the last part of the book, too. LOL ^_^. I totally had no chance of getting the book back from Inna's clutches so I waited for my turn to pick the class photos I wanted to order. Those pictures would be the ones I would treasure and keep 'coz they are the most memorable ones. <br /><br />So where's crossing the line here? Well, I was so mad this morning and it went through out until after recess. Then I was crazy and high during math time 'coz Daniel kept teasing me and his laugh was contagious. And when you know when I start laughing, the whole world shakes. To sum it up, my mood was to the extremes today. My emotions crossed the limit, the line. I was either too happy or too pissed off, irritated. Now that I've written it out, it seems that my mood is back to it's normal state. ^_^ Yyah, I've got my own mood meter. <br /><br />There, I think that's what happened today. I just skipped narrating the bonding moments I had with Micha, Mika and Iman so I won't spill anything out. ^_^ Good times. Good times.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>~~AFM~~<br /><br /></strong><br /><br /><br /><br />P.S. I've found out where I've heard &quot;Trash to Treasure&quot;. It was Lean and Kuya Mikko's article title for a Feats article in the last issue of SN last school year. ^_^<br />"

"event","The title is from somewhere I have heard before. I can't remember where I've heard it. Anyway, I'm not feeling so unworthy anymore. Too much goodness has happened today that made me happy.<br /><br />First thing is the Filipino Shadow play. From what happened: me OVER-whispering &quot;kura&quot; while the show is going on, the background music extending a little bit off the scene, ruining Ianne's concentration 'coz of my &quot;kura&quot; WHISPER, I thought that the group would get a not so good grade. I was wrong. We got a 96 and I'm happy for that. At least, all the trouble that I had to go through in fixing the permits and the illegal staying of some of my group mates paid off ! ^_^.<br /><br />Second thing was CCF. I felt totally in game when I heard my grade in the symbolism for Human Dignity activity. Golly, I thought I was gonna get something different. :D Thank GOD! Actually, I arrived at school in a bad mood 'coz i thought I was going to be late so I rushed walking to the classroom and I arrived seeing my desk in the most disastrous state. Yeah, I was pretty ticked off early in the morning and CCF saved me.<br /> <br />Next is that I totally passed my Chem quiz a while ago. I'm not a failure in Matter! We had double period Chem today and I forgot to do my assignment on quantum munbers so while the class was reviewing about everything discussed in Jeopardy format, I was rushing to do my assignment. And I thought my record page would receive a shining donut on it. =))<br /><br />AP&nbsp;got me a little pissed off. God, the teacher got all of us worried when speculations spread that the quiz was moved today. Good thing that it was just a joke and we had a review today. But still, I don't like it when people joke about not fulfilling the deal. At least, i got a free review for tomorrow's quiz.<br /><br />TLE became my free period. I spent the hour in the library searching for play scripts and the pang-abay (adverb) assignment in Filipino. It took me 9 pesos including the homework in Chem. Heehee. I also realized that the Geometry book I bought is really useful. Yeah, During math, we had this exercise and I had no idea how to solve the proving so I gave up bending my mind and took a peek at the book. The book had the postulate applicable to the problem stated in the exercise. I just hope what I scribbled down was right. Now, Daniel even photocopied some of the pages for his review ^_^.<br /><br />I went back to the classroom seeing lots of people finishing their TLE&nbsp;quiz. It included PC &gt;=D. Harhar. Then I saw Abby who looked... 'coz she couldn't find the wrong entry that unbalanced her balance sheet. Good thing she found it before time and changed the necesarry errors, I think. Anyway, my favorite part of dismissal today, was walking towards the guardhouse...<br /><br /> <br /><em><strong>Trash to treasure. Bullshit to bliss. ^_^</strong></em>&nbsp; <br /><br />"

"event","Trash. rubbish. dirt. junk. useless.unworthy. I can't think of any more synonyms to add to that. Anyway, I'm trying to relieve myself from the stress I am currently feeling. <br /><br />I don't know where to start so I better enumerate the stuff that I am currently facing:<br /><ul><li>I have to finish the script for Teatro (Sa Pula, Sa Puti) by Tuesday night</li><li>I have to finalize the BGSounds as well as the costumes for my group mates in the Filipino Shadowplay</li><li>I have to write as well as wait for the incoming news articles for the second -ish</li><li>I have to balance all those with my studies. Imagine, I have to face roughly 3 quizzes tomorrow. </li><li>I am also feeling guilty about numerous things</li><li>To top it all off, I am, yet again, trying to get used with my dad here.</li></ul>I'm starting off with the school work. I'm 75% finished with the script for Teatro. All that's left is the few pages that need to be re-typed, a good proof-reading session and my creative mind to work. i got a little pissed off during dismissal today when i received news that the person I entrusted with some parts of the script lost the copy. It sucks 'coz I have to find that copy in the library tomorrow and I'd have to retype it again in my PC. Yeah, I AM going to do it on my own. It was a good thing, though that a friend helped lessen the load I'm carrying. Deadline is on Wednesday and I have a strong feeling that I am sleeping later tomorrow than tonight.<br /><br />The BGSounds and costumes are almost through. It's simple, really. The usual peasant skirt and white blouse for the girls and the red PJs with the farmer hat, slippers and white kamisa de chino for the guys. BGSounds? I'm just gonna ask Raine to burn it or store it in a mp3 player.<br /><br />One news article down, and a few more to go. Well, that's just for the articles that I'm writing. what about the ones I need to edit? xD This past weekend, while doing other stuff, I've done a little reflecting. I questioned myself, &quot;Why am I getting myself into so much trouble when I can live my life the simplest way possible?&quot; It's always like that with me. I think my mind loves to undergo stress. I joined SN to have fun at first but now, after being appointed into a position I thought I was worthy of, I've reconsidered my thought. I think I suck at being an editor. God, I realized that I'm just good at ordering people into doing things. I feel like I'm more of a dictator than a doer right now. I feel down. unworthy. I don't know if I would just laugh at the thought that there are those who are better than me in writing and I was the one placed as editor. No, I am not saying that I am ungrateful for what the alumni decided. I'm happy that they saw something in me. I think I'm just feeling insecured. Yep, I'm officially the girl with the big drama.<br /><br />Balancing a slow-mo roundhouse is easier than balancing my studies. I totally admit that. Yeah, I got a smashing 12 out of 25 score in a Math Quiz that's all about Trapeziods. Golly, geometry and Alec never work together. Then tomorrow, I'm gonna face 3 quizzes and they're gonna happen in three consecutive hours. Could my third year in high school get any better? Y'know, since last week, I have been preparing myself for the worst that I think is really gonna happen. And now that the worst is still happening, I have come to the conclusion that I should expect nothing more than what my effort has exerted. Goodbye, early examination days!<br /><br />I also feel guilty on numerous things. One was the SN thinggy, and as I am writing, I'm starting to get over it. Next thing was about the fixing the class' permits and all. I have never thought it was that hard going through all the paperwork, letting all sorts of staff sign the damn paper and getting through it with a little white lie here and there. Agh, Conscience is killing me right now. It's funny 'coz I, yet again, got myself into this mess. I could always act the indifferent role, but no, I'd rather be in all the action. See what it got me? Covering up for the whole and in a way being responsible for others at the same time tweaking my integrity here and there. I have officially understood the reality of being a Brother's keeper -The Sacrificial Lamb. I have experienced the reality first-hand. Anyway, it's not only that why I'm feeling guilty. Another thing that I'm currently feeling guilty of is what just happened to my brother. After the practice this evening, I found out that my brother was running a fever when I saw him lying down at the back of the car. Yeah, I'm blaming myself for making him stay with me until 7 in the evening just so i [with my group mates] can present something worht presenting to the class when the shadow play comes. Same goes with my mom. Yeah, I'm finally admitiing it. I don't like it when I overstay at school or go to other people's houses during the weekends to practice. It makes me feel that I'm intruding their rest days. It also pains me letting my mom drive me all the way to Las Pi&ntilde;as on a weekend so I can practice when she's driving us everyday 6 days a week to school and church. <em>All that a mom does for love. </em>..<br /><br />To top the whole post off 'coz it's getting late, I'm still trying to adjust with my dad here again. It's different when the house is dominated with women most of the time. Now that there's a man in the house, I feel that the walls of the house have become stiff and hard. It's as if there's a foreigner living in our house. No offense to dad. I'm a feminist and I'm used to a house all with women. Well, my brother counts as a male but not yet a man, still a lad. What's more is that I am in the state wherein if I get irritated, I either block out everything I hear and shut up or answer ina dominating way. That's how Leos are. And well, people like me. Domineering. I hope I don't end up an old maid with this. xD LOL. =)) I repeat, I have nothing against him. I'm trying to get used to the house getting full again. <br /><br /><br /><em><strong>Lies do always hurt., when you get to know the truth.</strong></em><br /><br />"

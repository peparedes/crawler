"event","~  I redecorated my bathroom last weeks, it finally looks hella cool, and way better.  Got a new shower curtain- Andy Warhol ""pop art"", hell yea!  Its clear with 16 blocks of 4? ( i think) different pop art prints of his-like the Marilyn Monroe, Campbells soup can, Dollar sign, And Elvis.. so much lighter now, yes.  Brightens up the bathroom a lot too, the bright colors, and the light coming in thru the window.  I also got a new turquoise bath mat, and a hot pink bath mat.  Go me."

This time I was 2nd from last to finish the final, hah,.. think it went well though, the test was pretty similar to the review, so it wasn't too bad.. I think it'd be hilarious to get another 3.8 in the class, just to continue my 3.8 streak from winter and spring qtrs, .. or not, i'm down with that too,.. I'm really not trying to sound.. 'conceited' or anything.. sorry, I'm just hoping for something like a 3.5 or higher.. just because (its a loooooong shot..) if I did end up doubling in french and perhaps trying to go for honors in french, i'd have to keep my french gpa at or above 3.7, for all the rest of my classes.. ehh.. and now i'm sitting at a 3.73 French gpa.. whatever, don't need to worry about that now.. all in alll, winter qtr- success, boy scoping- not quite as successful, but hey.. i went to school for the education right.. not the boys, hehe"

"event","~So, I've just gotten yet another email from HFS informing me that I've been offered yet another apt in Stevens Court.. which is really cool.. I just don't know what to do... From what I've calculated, the apt would cost just as much, if not less than the dorms, always a good thing, since I have no money.. from what I've calculated, the dorm, with a ""basic"" meal plan, will cost $2,042 per qtr. , while the apt costs $1,587/ rent for 3 months, of course, one has to add the cost of groceries/ household items, which I'm guessing would cost me about $150 per month ( Sarah says she spends about $130/ month, so I'm basing my own guess off of that), so with that, my grand total for the apt would cost $2,037.. yep a whopping $5 cheaper than the dorm, BUT keep in mind, food is much much cheaper when its not purchased in a (new remodeled, and therefore very expensive) dorm (prime example: the exorbitant food prices at McMahon 8), like, I can buy a box of cereal that'll feed me for, say, atleast 2 weeks, for $3, while at Terry, $3 will buy 3 single serving boxes of cereal-- 3 days worth of cereal, not 3 weeks-- or $1 will buy you one measly, lousy pint of milk, ripoff.. sigh.. also, I would assume that living in a 4 person apt, one would not have to deal with an entire floor of 50+ PMSing girls.. all at the same time, that would be pure.. hell... on.. earth.. And I'm guessing in an apt there would be less distracts, more time to focus on a double major-- less unfocused, idiot freshman to deal with... I sure as hell don't mind cleaning, cleaning is good for the soul, besides, we're all gonna have to do it eventually, we all have to grow up and live on our own and fend for ourselves eventually.. while.. cooking- not my forte.. but hey..thats what frozen chicken, ramen noodles, soups, various frozen delights, and microwaves are for! right!?! .. sigh.. well.. I've got less than 48 hrs to write them some sort of reply...

~oh and if you're curious, I'm totally all for apt life, the only thing holding me back from jumping at the opportunity is total and complete apprehension about living with 3 other strangers, and not wanting to leave Amanda behind... she's the only cool person available to live with now... sigh.. :/  .. I just don't know

"event","~ Man, today was just really unfortunetly crappy.. I'll try to keep it short, since i've got about 4 1/2 blank pages to fill for my ppr due tomorrow morning, sigh, anyways.. here's some of the stuff that went down today:

- this morning there was a cop parked on the side of the road next to hwy 18, always  a bit un-nerving.. for me and my speeding..
-there was a diff. bus driver this morning, a real stupid ass hole guy, I know i'm blowing it out of proportion but: when I got on the bus this morn, he was likke ""hey.. Hey, excuse me..""etc .. I was like ""whaaaa"".. so I showed him my damn UPass again, shoved it in his face and held it there so he could really see it.. .. damn, what the hell, stupid dumb fuck
-the bus got a fucking flat tire in the middle of I-5! damn!.. i was sitting next to the window in the back, as a see a huge flap of rubber fly by.. we end up driving the rest of the way on a flat.. 
-bus driver took the 168-B exit instead of #169, no idea why, so we ended up going over 520 and going thru campus south to north instead of north to south.. stupid..
-got to comm. and the bathrooms were being cleaned, had to go upstairs eh..
-go back from the potty, spilled my cup of peaches/ peach juice everywhere, had to make another trip to the bathroom on hte 3 floor to be able to clean up the mess
- was suuuuper tired in class, nearly fell asleep
-got to french class, was really tired, nearly fell asleep
- went to the HUB, their bathrooms downstairs were 'out of service' .. had to go upstairs.. grr..
- stupid LaRouche fuckers tried to talk to me, but i was like ""Im votin for kerry, and I already talked to you, GOODBYE!""  i really dont like them, they can shove it!
- and of course, of all the days I'd love to have something nice happen- it of course didn't-- AKA-- no sighting of my sexy eye candy, as usual, sigh
- on the way home, I rubbed my eyes at a stoplight, and my contacts fell out.. had to pull over to take em out and put on my glasses,
-back in auburn, yet again, there was a sherriff parked over hwy 18, made me and my speedy ways nervous.. sigh..
-the kids outside are hella loud, im hella tired.. although i did take a nap today...

~ Now i need to really start my comm paper...sigh
~ cross your fingers for me and hope I get a sexy male sighting before the qtr ends this week, one to top all others, and make up for the lack of them all summer qtr long, hah,.. sigh.. one can hope right..

~I'm so exhausted, and don't feel like writing, lets see how much I can squeeze out, ahh.. Well, I hate the heat, well, more specifically, riding the bus for an hr. in the stifling heat, ugh, it sux, it's exhausting, and extremely uncomfortable. oy.  Well today started out interestingly enough,-- I drove right on by Tanner in his honda on I-5 this morning, it was super cool, I guess it could have acted as a predeccessor of the other interesting things yet to come.  Went to Comm class this morning, and I couldn't sit still and was uncomfortable, as always, sigh, those chairs are the worst!... Talked to Sarah and Sarah, planning on seeing a movie on Sat with Sarah, hahaha... 5 million Sarahs..joy. Ah but the 'fun' really started once I got to 'my other' class.. 1. my contacts finally started really bothering me during the 2nd half of class, so I took them out after class.. but to backtrack a bit.. during our break in the middle of class, I went outside to call Chrissy and drop her a line, this was at about.. oh, 1pm, and 'lucky' enough for me, while standing outside the building, talking on the phone, who do I see walking up and into the building.. yea, you guessed it, baf.. odd.  made me queasy.  So then, I go and take out my contacts, and walk over to the HUB to find something to eat before heading for the bus, because I was about to die (not eating breakfast is not a good idea, ah), I settled for a banana and ate it.. but before that, when I was walking up to the doorway to enter the building, who do I run into.. yep, right again, gah! and he actually caught my attention first by saying hi, I didnt see him, because I wasnt looking straight ahead, and I of course, said... nothing, just passed by with yet another shocked look on my face, meh.. That experience made me truly nauseaus and uneasy.  But to make this a complete circle.. I got what I asked for, not the way I thought I'd 'get' ""it"", but I got ""it"".  And I've learned my lesson, .. Ok, I get it.. geez.. I think I'll just be taking an all out break from dudes for now, I'll just let the chips fall where they may, and get back to a normal existence, man."

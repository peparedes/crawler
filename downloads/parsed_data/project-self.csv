"event","so christmas went well, i think. i always feel awkward on these types of holidays. i think it's mainly because christmas doesn't mean much to me at all.  i don't have any religious attachments to it, and i honestly think that the whole buying shit of christmas is disgusting. it's an empty materialistic holiday.  people go into major credit card debt just to make sure that their children and family have a ""good"" christmas and it has no basis whatsoever.  the amount of money that is spent is obscene.  it is a holiday approved by congress for the consumer nation.  it's a bunch of commercial hype.

not to say that alec and i didn't exchange gifts.  but we exchanged them more around the end of november instead of two days ago.  i got a nintendo ds and i bought him a used road bike.  we've also exchanged quite a few things since then.  i'd really like to break free from the christmas celebrations.  which is hard, especially when you family that is 100% into it.  i just find it to be ridiculous.  i know, i know, i'm a grinch, blah blah blah.  but the whole thing feels fake and contrived and i want no part of it.

we spend time with alec's father on saturday which was really nice.  he left later that evening for utah.  we spend xmas day with alec's mom, liz, and emily.  we cooked them lunch (which was awesome) and played poker.  it was good.  i'm just glad it's over."

"event","scrambling for ideas for presents for family.  i wish i had more than three days off of work.  i'm terrified of the idea of going to the mall tomorrow for last minute presents.  i hate shopping so close to xmas, and the people make it worse.  i'm looking forward to be shoved, beaten up, pushed out of line, merchandise taken from my hands, etc.  i'm expecting the worst, but not much more will happen than being shoved a few times, i'm sure.  this time of year really does bring out the worst in people.<p>
this whole jonathan thing is fucking me up. i'm doing better this week than i was last week, and the week before that, but i have no choice but to be better.  i easily could have been stuck in that rut forever.  i just can't believe what happened.  that it can all come and go so quickly.  with no last chances.  no anything.<p>
in other news: i am missing friends and family a lot this week. i hope everyone is well and that i will get to see you soon."

it's fast. it's lugged steel, and i think it was made in 1986.  i'm excited.  i need new pedals and i need to wrap the handlebars.<p>
school is almost over and i will be happy once it is.  damnit.  what a semester. what a year.  i don't even know how to reflect on time passed when it feels like the entire year is still here, squished up in a little ball all happening at once.  last i checked, it was still january.<p>

"event","we had alec's dad's car over the weekend.  i was supposed to pick him up from the airport at five yesterday, but his flight was delayed because of weather (he was flying from chicago).  he didn't end up getting in until after 1:00am and i didn't get to bed before 2.  needless to say i'm exhausted.  i can't wait to go home, cook some halibut and then lay on the couch until it's time to go to bed.  i need sleep tonight.  it doesn't help either that i've had a bit of trouble sleeping lately anyway.  there's something that's keeping me up and i haven't decided yet if it's my head or something totally external.

i have a fish on my desk.  his name is hank.  i have a snail too, but he hasn't a name.  they keep me company while i'm at work.  i also have a bamboo plant and some orchids.  i like my desk.

i don't have any pictures of my life.  it's quite sad.  i need to get on that. pronto.

alex should come visit me because i'm sick of her staying away.  IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS and i was only supposed to wait for two weeks.  ugh.

brew battle to commence on november 18th.  i think this is just an excuse to have a homebrew party where all we do is drink home-made beer.

i really need to charge my camera battery so that i can't start taking some pictures of the crazy nights we have together.

i really really really really need to find a new house to move into... this place is just too expensive and too big for just alec & i and bandini.

bleh.  new york in october.  and maybe maybe maybe los angeles soon?  please?  it can't be that expensive.  i need to just go for a three-day weekend."

"event","these past few days have found me off with extreme highs and lows but nothing in between. i have to contribute most of it to alex's departure from my state, and some other part of it to my bleeding vagina, and another large part of it to some major decisions and frustrations regarding what i want to do with and in this world.

and my god, it's not like alex is dead, although it has been feeling that way ever since she left.  i've been quick to cry but also quick to love and everything small just feels so huge and envelops me all the same.

i need to do something and i can't help but hate that it won't be something instant.  i'm going to school and i want to live life the way it was meant to be lived, i really just want to abuse it and feel it and be it, but i first need to figure out some purpose.  i can't let any more moments go by and i must, as a good friend once told me, live life as though i were writing a book of adventures.

but we were broken last night and we rebuilt and then we danced.

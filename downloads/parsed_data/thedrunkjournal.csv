"event","My mp3 collection has been fucked up for some time. Utterly destroyed would be more like it. I didn't realize that iTunes likes to hack apart your directory structure when archiving. Live and learn, eh? So, sometimes I get in the mood to hear certain songs and sometimes they're on an album by various artists. iTunes sortred by artist so it's a little work to get it fixed.

Back in the mid ninties, there was a video game music concert in Japan. The made a CD for it. I have it the mp3s from it. So, I wanted to hear their orchestral version of the Red Wings from Final Fantasy IV (II).  After consolodating the album into a single directory, I began listening to the other music.

There is a brilliant version of the LEgend of Zelda theme from Link to the Past. It kinda made me want to create a Zelda RPG. Heh, that won't be happening any time soon. But it also made me think about the premise of CoreE and even modern roleplay.

That makes me feel sick. I should be out there fucking making it with the shit in my head. Maybe it isn't the best, but it sure as fuck isn't as bad as a good deal of the other shit that's out there. Why not me? Why is it so critical that I suffer here all the fuck alone? All the fuck alone . . .

So, I'm gonna' fuckin go to Norman this weekend, even if it kills me."

"event","This stuttering fuck will never shut up. He prattles on and on and hurts my face. I want to kill the bastard. He's so jealous. HE has a young woman on his fucking arm. She looks hardened by her premature aging, though she's still my age. He's no less than 50, I fucking swear. Now he talks trash about Melissa. I don't love her, but I certainly feel protective. Don't fuck with my people.

ever

So you need to leave now fucktard. This is sorta odd. I felt like Cusorno not a few minutes ago. Seemingly I'm a pimp completely unbeknownst to me. There was this girl, Tishama, I think. She's rather attractive. I went to high school with her. She remebered and attempted a flirty dialog. I'm a flirter, so I played a little. She began to hit on me. I explained that I haver an Alexis at home. That was enough to break the dialog. I can't say that it doesn't make me feel good for it to of happened, though.

Oh God, I remeber he now. She was chunky and without social skill or grace. She was like Cindy in that respect. But now, a sexual beast. That makes me happy. I love to see people overcome their past lack of self e -- I swear to fucking God that I wanna kill that bitch. I am, of course, refering to the fellow from the first paragraph. He's still there, still bantering listlessly. Foolish man.

But then, a bit later in the day, this older woman was all about the Ryan. By older, I mean 40. She was flirty, as people tend to be, but when I was done with her vehicle inspection. She kept trying to drive on the dialog. She wanted to make something more of our talks. Such desire in her eyes. It makes me feel dirty to go with the angry for that fuck talking smack across from me.

Alright. That's what I had to say. A vent, I guess. So, ,um, 

I do feel nearly ecstatic to have something to call mine and to be called hers by. But that's all the mushy bits you'll get from me about the girly, for now."

"event","do you remember Angela? I do. I remember that bitch and how she fucked up Cracker. She was a bitch then. More so now. I wish I cared more about that.

She's fucking about with this shitty-ass organization that I run a VLARP for. Why do I run a VLARP. TO know me, is to know that I hate everything that the WOD stands for. I had a single ray of hope that is were bust-ass. It was Jeremy's sabbat game. Ah, good fun was had by some. Others makde backpacks. I almost killed Cracker. In characterm of course.

Well, I said that. Now then:

Melissa called me last night. She lamented her boredom, which I did in kind. Then, She said that we should watch some sort of DVD action. So we did. Good fun was had by all. But something ocured to me when she called.

This was probably the work of Steve, me father. He likely goaded her into calling. I can just see the dialog in my head.

M: Hi boss ;)
FT: Hey, employee. You know, you should give Ryan a call. He's probably bored too.

M: Huh?
MT: Yeah, you could call and say, ""Hey Ryan, I'm bored, let's do something"" (I fucking swear that he tries to dictate dialog to people).

M: k
FT: k

SCENE!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111

So, now I'm even more bitter today. But I wanna talk about the Cam*. I'd like to write a fucking dissertation on how much it confuses and bothers me that people want bullshit in there fun. I mean, do we really need a compliacted ruleset for fun?

For more evidence, clicky below:

So there it is. The source material for what may well be the biggest bitch fest of our time.

Are you dead?

I don't think so, but it's all becoming a little goddam fuzzy. Maybe I fucking am. The only things that made me feel normal have been stripped the fuck away from me. Fucking Norman.

I sit in this fucking hell-hole waiting until time can leave me alone. But fuck it. Angyry Fucking Face.

So, there's Shawn. He'll always be up to coming over and doing nothing. He likes to sit in the room while I do shit. That's not quite right. But he's so fucking closed and moody. I've got no use for that.

Like Chris. He never had anything to say except that he's fucking up his life one hour at a time. Like I want to hear about that. He says he's sad because Shawn and I aren't doing anything with our lives!!!!!11 The fucking nerve. That bitch had to drop half his courses last semester.

Then there are the new folk. Alexis is a fucking user., So, why keep her around, eh? I probably won't. Where the fuck is the work? Where is my escape plan? All the fucking doors are shut!

So, I look for a damn job. . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . nothing. nothing nothing. 

Um, what else? I find myself atracted to a beast that I am ashamed to admit my attraction to. A girl who is seven months pregnant with some fuckholes kid. I know little will come of it all beacause I dont want a damn kid. She's atracxtive, in a ""I kinda like her brain"" sorta way. And don't anyone go off and tell me that I* shouldn't, because I know that.

I wanna go home. I wana find home. I'm fucking lost here and it's becoming a little more than I can take.

Am I dead? Sometimes, I wish I were."

Hungry hands carve and crave across stripped skin
Flashes of light expose images in monochrome black and tan
And scarlett sheets

Shattering thoughts are hushed so as not to carry
Between and outside gaunt walls that only serve to enclose
But not deceive.

Swaddled by lust and transgressions fighting to inhale oxygen that
Throbs in heat and pain and infidelity as we are left only
to gasp and grieve
In tangled air. 

After craving becomes loathing; the inconsequential consciousness of Adultery
Lingers between emaciated walls and matted sheets
And seizes perception.

The silence gains momentum as it punctures heated bodies and stares
Relationships once forged burn and break as arctic apologies from frigid lips
Collapse and shatter."

Entertianing the thought of
you and I togther
even though i know
it'd never be.

And somehow, 
it seems so appropriate
to be writing this

watching the rain

you seem so...
Faceted.

I know so little of you
yet i am so intruged 
by your knowing grin
and the lines on your face
too old for years

Six years my senior
four of them on a Navy ship
Two here, now, no 
stories shared with me. 

Like I said: Intriguing...
How you've caught my interest, 
Probably because I'm like
a Little sister 
you never had.

How can i know?
We talk for hours, 
but say nothing more than
formulas for the truth.

And what little 
I do know i seem
to only stumble upon
When I search your name. 

But still I can't help but
Wonder, as the rain lets up,
What would it be like on
a Navy Ship? To 
kiss your lips with
your hand on my hips and
softly say to a sailor:
""I want to know you better."""

We were up before sunrise
Waiting for the boys to come back home.

Our own little world
Down in this big bent valley
Two girls in the park, Alone.

And up we climbed to see them,
Resting on the part way down
Waiting for the boys to come back home.

And as they topped the last high rise
We smiled and waved and called them down
Two girls on the path, alone.

And now I sit here, content to be
Looking back on memory
No longer waiting for the boy to come back home
One girl in the world alone."

The space that lies between us
Space between stars and hearts
And cities

And I look to the stars at night
Bright, and I could almost reach them. 
Save the space

Space between bodies and minds
How spaced out are we, really?
Not too far from space, it seems.

But the space between hearts 
Seems the greatest space of all
How wide that space seems now.

And it seems space between bodies
Serves to increase space between hearts and stars
So it would seem, and yet,

How does this space seem so great,
And so small still,
To let me touch the moon at night?

And in this space the stars still shine
In skies so far and hearts so near
What is space anyway?"

There is a silence that falls over us
a hush between indecsion ans action
a silent undead history
that keeps my heart from yours

And from you a simple dissatisfied glance
a simple sigh, and an unintended anger
that only bothers you
and tends to further sadden me

a moment lost forever in time
and emotions that are a river damned
with years of nothing written in my heart
empty spaces, blank pages, likely never filled.

and all the power held over me
the daunting nothing that will forever keep me separate
that makes me believe in alone forever
is still what makes me die in my dreams late in the eve

but thoughts that creep over silenced bedrooms 
are those of suspiscion, where one wonders 
how long will it take for him to fill the pages
how long will it takes for me to let him fill the pages

Neither of us are deaf. We both hear the silence."

well thats what you must be
it takes a real man 
to scare a little girl like me
twelve years old
pretending not to hear the fight
hoping that we wouldn't have to leave for another night
away from you running hiding scared
lyin in the bedroom, buried in a paperback
pretendin that it wasn't my momma
that was screamin in the back
mommy got mad at daddy, took his guns away
down below the water is where the bullets stay
takes a real big man to pull a gun on a child
just wanted water fom the tap
but i heard your gun cock at that
Kids are smarter than you think
the stress was a killer
the wieght in the air
at night i bit my lip til it bled, 
but you didn't care/
you think i'm gonna forget 
how scared i was of you?
Fat chance, Fat man
Big man, screamin, speedin'
120 in a school zone
your real big now
intimidate a nine year old
the homework wasn't done, daddy
fly her fast to school
so she'll always know
how big you really were
Tell her that shes hopeless
remind her everyday
so her self esteem is shot
so that she's everything youre not
and it takes a big man
to scream and cuss and fight
to raise a hand at his daughter, 
and kick a door at his wife.
You should slap me right now
lay your hand acroos my face
one good hit
gets me out of this place
But your a big man now
livin on your own
pop back in at seventeen
homecoming queen, senior's dream
parents night
please not another fight
but nothing changes for the big man
always gotta win
surrounded by love,
but you gotta butt in
with a gun on your side
fifty yard line
crowned queen in a nightmare 
with you standing right there
raise your fist at seventeen
9 year olds don't hit back
17 year olds do
smart choice, big man
be scared and walk away.
pretend you didn't raise a hand 
to your girl on homecoming day
no you didn't hit your wife with your hands,
you just missed her with the truck
Fuck, man, thats your wife there
covered in thrid degree burns
i grabbed her arm so you'd miss
peeled her skin from my hands 
but you didn't seem to care
COPS are coming daddy
get the hell out of here
what would your friend on the force think
if they saw you now?
run big man,
its what you do best
2nd only to the times 
you've scared me shitless
takes a real big man to scare a little girl
but little girls grow up, in a cold and cruel world
you'll hit a nine year old 
but i'm bigger now,
raise a hand to me now
what are you afraid
you'll beat a little girl 
but not now on homecomg day?
lets ssee how long you'll last
against my anger and rage
It'd be a blast
to see the fear in your eyes  
the fear i used to know
but now I call the shots
and you ain't got no power
we're playin by my rules now,
how ya like them apples?
I don't need your guns mans
this we fight for real
big man to big man
we'll see who can deal
Things change, Fat Man,
and i'm no little girl
your tricks won't work here
i'm no longer daddies girl
and you ain't got a wife to beat
and you and got a gun to shoot
So What now, Big man, 
What you gonna do?"

the warmth of your soul,
even as tainted as you think it may be."

Beat. Music. Dance. Groove.

I hear the beats, hear the music
make me dance, make make me move
follow sounds to rythm 
of the flow in my groove

count the beats blast the music 
slam those sounds watch me move 
write that dance to the rythm 
of the soul in my groove

know my beats feel my rythm 
put your body in my moves
do my dance take that chance
show me what you have to loose

I want your body grooving rythm
your confidence, coincidence, successfullness
your sex, sexuality, experience, confidence
your pride, pain, power, devour

all my pain, lose it all
take it with you when you go
use your music, use your power
to unchain my saddened soul.

Use the music, set me free,
from my own calamity.
I do this dance, to remove
all the sadness in my grove

when i'm free pump the music
you'll see my body groovin too
because my dance is my romance
cause its what i love to do."

"event","Where education turns into a vaste wasteland
of inefiiciancy and irritation
and the harmonies and melodies that used to make me dance and sing
only prove to make me cry

where those who are pillars refuse to suport, 
so you fall into the crashing stormy waves
try then to reach and pull you out
pretending that they didn't collapse to cause your own demise

where expectations of wonder and excitement 
are met only with confusion and boredom
and they only way to find a way 
is to call on those that want to watch you fall

that is where you will find me
standing miles from familiarity
sick, cold, and alone
holding back tears so those 
who want watch me fall 
won't live to see me cry."

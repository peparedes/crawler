  Dark and sleek.
  Preying primarily on the weak.
  A Wolf's ghost past on silent feet.
  As it stalks amid the jungle heat.
  Purple-on-black, shimmering, sheening.
  A Raven ripples, glimmers, gleaming.
  Soft visions from low-lighted glow,
  Reflected off blackberry merlot.

  Could twist the sinews of thy heart?

  Do I follow My instincts blindly?

  And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
  Do I sit here and try to stand it?

  Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness,
  Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?

  But then I just end up getting hurt again!

  If I turn my back, I'm defenseless!
  And to go blindly seems senseless.
  If I hide my pride and let it all go on,
  Then they'll take from me till everything is gone.
  If I let them go I'll be outdone.

 You whispered in my dreams.
 You said.
 That fate could never end our love.
 That there was no power stronger.
 On Heaven, Earth, or Hell.

Chorous: You gave to me your last soft breath.
         Now I pray for death.
         The rest of time without your touch.
         How I long for death.

 Then they came.
 To take you back to heaven's edge.
 Now soft your wings hang at your side.
 And the branches close around you.
 To hold you for all time.

 I held your heart.
 And you fell from heaven's grace.
 Held your gaze.
 But your eyes see nothing now.
 Felt your breath.
 But your voice is silent now.
 Death comes swift.
 But love never fades away.

 the lies... Mocking everything I feel.

 She dances slowly. A siloet upon the curtains. Her eyes seemed
 to cry only empty tears.

 I begged for comfort with them. Wouldn't matter at best.
 It meant so much to me, and yet so little to her. And I
 am sinking into a mountain of self-pity. Why can't I simply
 disregard all the things I feel?

 Where is my angel?
 Where is my angel,when I did him most?

 Where is my angel?

 Tell me now, where did he go?

  

  I wrote this song ""where is my angel"", back in april of 2000.
It meant a lot to me because, it envolved the story of my son Lucus, and my ex-wife Christina. Christina never wanted kids, but after Lucus was born, she feel in love with him. He was born on November 28th, 1996. We lived with my fathers best-friend, Donnie in Brooklyn, New York. When Lucus and I were caught in a drive by in Romania, and Lucus passed away, I spent 4 months in the hospital
and under-went 6 surgaries to repair massive artearial damage to my upper left leg, plus a frontal hip replacement. Christina admitted to me that she had been having an affair w/ my older cousin Vlad.

  I was devistated! I had lost everything I held dear, in one second. My first son was dead, and my wife betrayed me. And my 10 month old son at the time, Gabriel, had nobody. After being released from the hosptital, I failed a psych. evailuation to reinstate myself to active duty to the USMC. My mother wanted Gabriel to stay with her and my father back in New Zealand, in order that he would be taken care of. I agreed. Gabriel, still currently in Queenstown with my family. I get to see him for 6 months every year, in which he stays with me up here in Washington. Those six months are always the best times of my life.

""Get out of the way!""
He's coming with a gun right behind you.
""Just run away, and don't look back!""
I said I'd protect you always... Didn't I?
""He's getting closer... Closer! Get up now child! 
Get up and run! I'll be right behind you.""

Blam, blam, blam... They all wizz by my side, I'm cold and crying this time. And I'm writing this time... Cause you died, and all I have is this rhyme.

I wrote this about a best friend that I had in High School. Her name was Brandy Mc'Niels. We knew each other since 3rd grade and did everything together. Her ex-boyfriend stalked her for about 6 months and then shot and killed her. I lost a lot that unforgetable day. She died right in front of me and I did nothing to stop it. I never even got to go to her funeral. Never got to tell her how much I loved and respected her.

I hope that anyone who reads this poem, and has lost a friend close to them at least understands that I know a bit about how they feel.

To who ever reads this,
my thoughts are with you.

I really think I am the biggest jackass on the entire planet. Why did I have to fly off the handle so quickly? And why, for the love of God, why did I have to tell Naoran-san about that! I really was just trying to stand up for Hiroto-kun, but look what I went and did! I really need to call Hiroto-kun tonight and apologize.......

Kanon-kun and I hung out the other day. He came over to help me take care of Toto-oni >>;; and then we went to dinner (my treat) and then back to Kanon's to watch Donald Duck. Unfortunately after all the commotion with Toto-oni I fell asleep pretty quick and just crashed on poor Kanon's couch! >>;; Thanks Kanon!~ <3 Ok, I have to go and finish cleaning.................

Yesterday I went out for ice cream with Hiroto-kun and his little puppy Toto-chan. It wasn't what I thought it would be if you know what I mean, but I still had fun. We went for ice cream and then we went to karaoke...where he sang Kinki Kids all night >>;; 

I think Asagi and I are going out sometime for food or ice cream, anyone else interested?

Teruki-kun and I hung last weekend, we watched perverted movies and stuff, and we looked at perverted pictures. It was really fun Teruki-kun, we should do it again soon. 

Hey Kanon-kun, why don't you give me a call and we can go out for something to eat? I like food.

Bou-chan, sorry I haven't been around much lately. I hope everything is alright. Give me a call and we'll hang out.

Yesterday Kanon-kun and I went to the mall to start our Christmas shopping...well we also bought some things for ourselves. I got this really nice sweater that Kanon-kun helped pick out, and Kanon-kun got these super hot pants! Anyways, after that we had pizza, it was good, mine was cheese and pepperoni and Kanon-kun just had cheese. After feeding me we had our pictures taken with Santa! *laughs* I told Santa that I had been a naughty boy and I needed to be spanked. He didn't spank me though v.v Kanon-kun <strike> then proceeded to spank me </strike> and I went to get some more shopping done ^______^ there was no spanking --.-- That is all really. Teruki-kun, call me!!

m(___)m Gomen minna-san! I've been a little busy lately, all kinds of boring things going on. But in some more exciting news, Kanon-kun and I hung out on the weekend. Friday night we watched a bunch of movies, all his movies though. He really didn't want to watch Attack of the Killer Condoms v.v But I guess I still had fun. And then on Saturday I was bored so I called Kanon-kun up and asked if he wanted to go for a walk to the park even though it was all snowy.  I threw a snowball at Kanon-kun and he threw one back, so I put some snow down the back oh his coat. After I made him push me on the swings, I still made my noises -- Faster Kanon-kun! Harder! -- but not nearly as loud as last time. Afterwards we walked back to my house and I showed Kanon-kun how big Miruku has gotten, the little oinker! He eats a ton! So the weekend was fantastic! That's all I really have. Teruki-kun, call me!

The other day Kanon-kun and I hung out. I was very lucky and he showed me his really big balls and then we decided that we should try his really big balls out. Kanon-kun handles his balls really well, they were very shiny. One even had his name tattooed on! It was sugoi! I felt so special when he let me touch them! It's a shame I'm such a shitty bowler compared to Kanon-kun v.v I'm surprised he could throw those massive bowling balls with such accuracy! AND I'll have you know that I managed to knock down at least five pins >.<

Last night the whole band went out for drinks, good fun was had by all. Bou-chan and Kanon-kun got drunk off their ass *laughs* It was good for all of us to go out again, it had been awhile since we'd done that. Bou-chan had some very amusing stories to share, I do love listening to his stories. After Kanon-kun crashed at my house and Teruki-kun walked Bou-chan home. Poor Kanon-kun had a really bad head ache this morning I think, he was outta here pretty fast after he woke up. Oh maybe he was mad over the joke I played on him! I'm very sorry Kanon-kun, but I couldn't resist! Please don't be mad!!

This afternoon I went over to Bou-kun's old apartto because he made me a beautiful and yummy cake and said something about coming and getting it before he ate it. I rushed right over! Luckily he was still there since I don't know where Hitsugi-san lives. Oh our little Bou-chan is all grown up! Anyways, we ate cake and chatted for a bit then decided to go to the mall. We went to Ecchi Banana and browsed the merchandise. I bought some new videos to add to my collection and then I helped Bou-chan buy his very first porn video! After that we went for some food and had hamburgers, Bou-chan couldn't finish all of his so I finished it for him. They were good. Bou-chan has very good stories to share these days!

That's really all I did today.

Just got back from Kanon-kun's place. We made cookies and watched a movie and almost died. First we made peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, they were quite good and we ate them all. Then we watched a movie, I wanted to watch porn, but Kanon-kun didn't have any and I didn't bring any, so we (I) settled for a comedy. After several minutes we realized Kanon-kun forgot to shut the oven off and the whole kitchen was filled with smoke! Good thing the fire alarm came on or we would have never known. Though it did interrupt our nice conversation on the couch. I'd like to continue it sometime soon Kanon-kun.

Hmmm, so yea, our band? Are we going to go out for drinks like we planned this week? I made my way over to Hitsugi-san's lj and read that Bou-kun was moving in with him. Ummm, Bou-kun? Could we maybe meet your boyfriend?  

Ok that was all.

Today Kanon-kun and I hung out and went to Miss Elizabeth's Muffin Cafe or something like that. Kanon had a banana-chocolate chip muffin and I had a strawberry one, and a banana one and a pineapple one! They were quite yummy!~ I took a picture!
<a href=""http://img175.imageshack.us/my.php?image=muffin35ml.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/4581/muffin35ml.th.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"" /></a>

Afterwards Kanon-kun and I went for ice cream and I had two and then I had some of Kanon-kun's because he was being slow and it was melting and was going to be wasted. *shakes head* I took another picture! This is Kanon-kun's cone.
<a href=""http://img157.imageshack.us/my.php?image=icecream3yt.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img157.imageshack.us/img157/5568/icecream3yt.th.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"" /></a>

After that I told Kanon-kun, ""Harder Kanon-kun, harder! Sugoi! Harder!!"" And at first he wouldn't, so I asked louder and a little more insistently. ""Oh, Kanon-kun, harder! Sugoi~~ harder! Oh!!"" And then he stopped pushing me on the swings (-.-) 

Then we went our seperate ways, but we should play again soon Kanon-kun! I had so much fun! But next time the muffins are on you!~~ Maybe Teruki-kun could tag along, ne? I think he needs to get out more and stop spending his evenings alone drinking >>;;

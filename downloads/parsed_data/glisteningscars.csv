"event","Sometimes i find it amazing how people can show such extreme ignorance to the fact that life is good... excluding myself... its mad that people can just sit and say that life sucks.. i mean its an impossibility that everything is completely crappy... i mea how realistic are you thinking if you can actually believe that nothing is ok...there is always something thats alright.. you always have to find the light at the end of the road.. and when you i think you become the wiser of drama, and such.... 
a couple of people i know are extremely hard to please...especially when given the wisdom they need to solve things... im not one to talk because when someone gives me advice i tend to not talk about it and do what i want.. but if theres anything i've learned through all of this, its to listen to the people that are closest to you and that know you the best... i've been going through some stuff lately.. some major parts of my life have been changing around and i havent been to sure on where to go but i have a pretty good idea that im going to be alot stronger after whatever happens...

        on a different note... my body is so freakin immobilized due to freakin a new workout plan its a badass thing though that is hopefully sometime in the next couple months make us look like ""Movie voice"" a.k.a. Nate... lol but its all good were working out everyday and its a pain in the ass... litterally my ass hurts due to that damn thing called the ""stairmaster"" me and nate found the speed button which made it go crazy and we were like working our asses off... i dont know. dude anyway...

anyway.. i really am without words due to the events of tonight....

and Kathryn... i still wanna take a trip to newyork with you inspite of my comments to night.."

"event","Tonight has been a little rough.... im up.. and i dont think im looking at getting much sleep tonight... because, i found out that MaNara is moving to texas... a great friend is having a real hard time with her boyfriend and doesnt know what to do.. so i spent the better part of my day conciling her and pushing my problems and pain aside for the sake of a friend... another friend.. is finally getting over his issues and is ""moving on""  with everything as he puts it... it isnt that i doubt him.. its that i know him... and if this is the end of it.. im am bowing before him... because i realize that it is one hell of a battle to stop the hurt and move away from it and see clear through the darkness... and come to terms with what needs to happen.. and whats easy...



Amazing that i dont know what to do huh... someone who has usually a flawless state of mind has been cracked.... i've been slowly falling apart for the past 3 months... and its gotten to me.. instead of the hardass carefree prick i used to be... i am a soft disfunctional tear machine that doesnt know anything but a pool of emotion residing behind his eyes... 

toinght i almost snapped... tears were shed.. yes... many to be accounted for... i feel like breaking down... the happiness i once knew to be all i wanted is back.... and the happiness i have found and wanted to keep is leaving....

Ashley..... 


Everything happens for a reason... and if whats meant to be is meant to be... then it shall be...

on another note... 

i found something out tonight and had to nurse one of my bestfriends because of an incident that i will not forget and will not take lightly... i will only say a couple things on this because it is extremely personal.... BLAKE AND BRANDON.. YOU MIGHT THINK YOU ARE SOME TOUGH FUCKIN MXERS WITH YOUR LITTLE FAGGOT POSSE THAT CONSISTS OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF ASS RAMMING, MONKEYSPANKIN, SPLINTERED WOODEN SPORK SHANKING CUM GUZZLING FUCKIN FROZEN TAMPON POPCICLE MONSTERS (ahh thank you) BUT IF I EVER FUCKIN SEE YOU.. I SWEAR TO FUCKIN GOD I WILL FOLLOW THROUGH WITH WHAT YOU COULDNT DO THAT NIGHT YOU BITCH ASS NUTSUCKING 2 CENT MOMMAS RIDE TO GET OFF WHILE HER PIMP IS OUT OF TOWN, THUNDERCUNT... (lol thats still funny even tho is doesnt flow or make sence kinda)  SO WATCH YOUR BACK...

"event","A world full of hate,
I take this as my fate.

My love for life is true,
but how can this be it?

with Sunshine on skies of blue,
the flame of my heart is lit.

with the truest of truths 
are those of our youth.

wielding the weapons of freedom of speech
the poetic failures of our teachers who wont teach..

only lies ontop of lies shrouded on a blank canvas of black
the words and wisdoms lost to the forgotten white background we'll never get back

forever were denied of the chances to live...
limited to what boundaries life has to give...
forget me in the future... forgotten to the past...
lifes important lessons... are always learned last...

the ending of this thought, 
is short and introspective
with battles we fought.. think why
our parents are overprotective....

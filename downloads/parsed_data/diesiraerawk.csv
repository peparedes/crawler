"event","Hello wanderers, if you happened to stumble upon this recent entry, your quite the marcelo stalker....cause i havent posted anything in this piece for about two seasons, i think. But dont get me wrong, your presence here is welcome. Recent developments : There was quite the incredible Paladores show last friday. It was mad phun, and lots of people showed up which came as a surprise, a freakin awesome surprise. And as an added bonus, the footage of the show was quite supurb.   And in other news : Skool started last week, its alright i guess, its just too time consuming, considering you wanna do well. Its nice to go to a place where you always see people you know or people from your past.   In other news : I need a jeuf.   In other news : Todd smells....I'll see ya around...."

I wore a pink shirt to work on wed., some of you might know the one im speaking of. It seemed like those people had never seen a guy wear a pink shirt....come to think of it, i havent really either. It was cool though, cause i got a billion and one compliments on it, zang! I now have two jobs....crap....so your chances of seeing me again are....none, haha, jk, im gonna destroy my body.

Well, last night Tried n True/Steel/Dies Irae was supposed to play a show....but that didnt happen cause the guy running it did some stuff wrong or something, i dont really now. So...we had to call like 27,562 faces and tell them not to go to the show....or else. So in the shows place, we filmed the first in a string of short films we are goin to create. Its called Dr. Lorax (2), go to sneakyjohn.com to download it, its completely random, but it was fun to make. Then we ventured to little ceasars to grab 4 5$ pies, umyay. Soon after, me and the adrian left cause my body was atomized by working all week. Much anticipation is building up in my body....im getting my new drum kit in approximately 2 weeks. Its gonna be deluxe, and it better be, shoot, im droppin like 15 hundred for that beast. Im gonna stare at it everyday and smile....i might sleep on it too, cause itll be that beautiful. Tonight, im goin to go see dylan rawks new band with jenn and the gang, a good time is ensured. Okay, im out, time to find my power ranger underwear to please the masses....you heard me..."

"event","Ok, so its been around a month and a half since i last updated this beast of a journal. Lots and lots of stuff has happened in that time, lots of changes, lots of fall out, lots of everything. Most events i cant even remember, so ill discuss the things i remember and such. I got myself a new job, im a Guident soldier now, and i like it very much, but its kinda suckin my life dry, this job totally changed up where i put all my time. I wake up at 3.5 in the morning, and i work everyday until 2.5 in the pm. Its crazy, but i get a ton of hours and good pay, so im all for getting terminated everyday for it. But i get very bored, so, if anybody who is reading this feels like sayin hi when im work, please do so, it really makes my day. i get breaks at 7 and 9.5, and lunch at noon, so if you drop me a text, id reply then, my digits is nine o nizzle 306-4598, if you dont already have um. Please drop a line sometime, i dont know many people there and it gets lonely. Someone has to get a job there, so i have someone to hang out with, cause my lunch plans everyday go as follows...go to truck, eat pop tarts, and listen to norma jean...and if i get enough time, i go to in-n-out and get some cola, haha, im a nerd i know. Lets see, in other news, my band situation is getting kinda weary, adam is done with tried and true, and paladores is comin along slow, but i think we have something very good going. If you are reading this, you must go to the Tried n' Trizzle/Steel show this friday, its in perris, go to sneakyjohn.com for the address and such, i know i will, i dont know how to get there either, haha. Termination. So this last weekend was V-Day weekend, i had no one special person to share it with, but i did hang out with some great people over the weekend. On V-day, i went to the tooth and nail tour with brittney to see Anberlin for her birthday, i ended up liking every band on the bill which is always nice, and it turns out that the singer from anberlin can scream like a banshee, something i didnt expect at all, way tuff. The next day i found myself at the same venue(epicentre) to see mae and copeland, o my gosh, very rad show, i loved it. Went to that spectacular with Jenn, Katy p, Sarah, and a girl i hadnt met before, Monique, sidenote, i thought she was cute, i liked her hair, haha. Jenn reminded me that i have a pair of Power Ranger underwear, and how rad they are, i think a little trip to the pool/jacuzzi is in order so i can break them in again, haha. The night ended different in that Jenn was almost pushed into committing a 187 on an enemy, ive never seen her so violent before, i kinda liked it, i like brutality, haha. It was kinda ironic since all that happened right after mae's set, which almost made me cry cause they are so emo. Emo preceeding brutality is definately a different specticle, but im all about beatdowns, go figure. If you happen to get a chance, and some money, go out and get the Tenacious D dvd, its nonstop humor, theres quite a bit of explicit language and such, but its still really funny, pick it up. Im kinda sad, i went to ticket master to get tickets for The Darkness at canes the day they came out, and wouldnt ya believe it, they were sold out, who would guess that so many people would wanna see a bunch of euro-rock fools in sparkley white jump-suits. O well, theres plenty of shows to look forward to still...did i hear facedown fest?....i think i did. Shockwave! finally, ive wanted to see them since like freshman year in high skool! so rad! okay, im gonna stop writing now cause its like seven o clock, and i find that i have to go to bed at like 8 to stay sane the next day at work, so with that, i bid thee a good nite. -Crusher of Souls"

"event","I had this idea the other day, i thought it would make a neat short story, or maybe even a broadway musical, haha. Anyway, my idea goes like this...Okay, the setting is not too far into the future, and some sort of cataclysmic event happens and all life on earth is no more...but not before people invent one last great invention, a robot, but not any robot, this robot does it all, its the only one of its kind, and has something close enough to be called emotions or something like that, maybe kinda like that kid in A.I., but this robot looks like a robot, maybe a block-head lookin one, and grey in color. And this robot will never die, its fully self-sustaining, but see the problem is, he has nothing to do, theres no one left...so what is a robot to do? what would a robot do in this situation? Wander? Self terminate? Do nothing? Be lonely? Thats all i got, i just thought it was a neat concept, i got the idea after listening to the secret song on the new coheed cd, ridiculous i know. Tell me what you think would happen to this robot, we'll call him Buddy-Tron. What would happen to Buddy-Tron?
ps-whats your favorite color?"

Then i proceeded to barnes and nobles to hang out with Britt cause we havent hung out in the heartiest time, we used to hang out like everyday. So we enjoyed the books then left all boredifyied...Thats when i brought up Cabazon, boy was that a good call. She ended up ditching a poor kid and we went to go see the dinosaurs where pee-wee herman hung out so many years ago, and got some dinosaur lovin to the maxx!!! Got some rad pictures of the dinosaur lovin and thier massive feet and it was all good. i must say, that was one of the raddest random trips ever. It was a funny experience, thanks britt, sorry you had to ditch your friend in the process, i feel bad for the kid. In other news, the show is on friday, if things work out the way i hope they will work out, i will get to play three sets in a row, but who knows. Paladores is gonna start recording soon, probley this weekend sometime, if we can get a stable place to do it at. Tried n Trizzle's turn is sometime over the winter break, woo hoo! Im goin to start skool next semester!! rawk! i cant wait, but i know im gonna wanna quit after the first two weeks, but i figure ill cherish the enthusiasum while i have it, i guess im just excited about having something to do on a regular basis. Im such a nerd. Ill need help in my spanish class even though my skin color would suggest otherwise, im so not mexican...my mom says so. I need a new job now, cause best buy is mean and i dont like them anymore, haha, that was quick. My dad told me to quit, he knows what hes talkin about. I wanna go to vegas now!!! ahhh, marty!! and i really wanna go to one of the cirque shows so bad, and im the only one!! if you or anyone you know wants to go see the cirque show with me, let me know, its way rad and i dont wanna enjoy that shmack by myself, it would be lame.

"event","I feel incredibley awesome right now. Last night was one of the greatest nights ive ever had. Played two sets back to back, and it wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be. I had mad energy the whole time, im sure God had something to do with it, cause i know for a fact that i wouldnt have been able to do that on my own by no means. Then sean asked me to step up for the Punisha and play No One Gets Out Alive with them, and if you know me, you would know 6-7 words ago that i said yes. So i did, and it was mad fun like always. Im very proud to say that i broke my broken stick record last night!! i usually never break any sticks, but last night i broke somewhere between 7 and 9 sticks!! Not only did God give me the energy to play two sets back to back without much trouble, but he also gave me the strength to break all wooden objects in sight!! I know God was working through me last night, i just know it. Apologies to matt chan, sorry for breakin both your sticks you let me borrow, i will definately hit you back up for those. Rob, i love your new tat, it is mad supreme, its very perty. Thank you everyone who came out to the show last, i love you, and anyone who couldnt make it, i love you too just as much, if not more. I love everyone! Then after the show blaec called me out, honestly, i was kinda scared at first cause i had no idea what it was about, but then he offered me a chance to play one of Falling Cycles lasts shows at chain, once again, if you know me, you know i said yes. So hes gonna get back to me with that, hopefully it happens, cause that would be so rad to play with some of my american-metal heroes. Even if i dont play, im gonna try to make it to that show, its dec. 19 at chain, be there, or be a stick of deodorant you slum babies. After the show concluded, me and adrian went to a lock-in at our good friend shawn wilhites church. it was way rad, shawn is the resident worship-master(musically speaking) as far as im concerned. He is such an awesome guy, and such an encouragement, and he has the voice of an angel. haha, tis true people. anyways, it was a long night, and i only had 3 hours of sleep, i am a tired body right now, but i feel so great...except my neck, remember kids, headbanging destorys your bodies, honestly, i feel like old man C...but i will continue to rawk, who needs necks right?! okay, im done righting now, i love you, God bless"

Hear that goblin girl??!! Anything! haha, old skool. Honestly, i cant remember the last unhappy moment ive had with my friends around, and for that i say thanks to all of you. If you know my name, then you are my friend, and i love you. I just pray that everyone can just keep it real for God, and that God would help guide us all in everything. Show tomarrow!!! If you read this before then, please pray for me, that i dont die playing two sets back to back. Im gonna be such a sweaty body afterward, like soaked-boy style!!! sick, i know, but none the less, a reality. I pray that i dont forget why im playing, God gave me this gift of music, so im using it to glorify Him, there is no better reason to play, no matter what i may think sometimes. I really hope to see you all at the show, if i dont, i will be thinking about you, for sure. Love."

Ive been reading a lot of old school fairy tales lately, those things are rad. Not like the disney versions though, the death metal old skool versions where people die left and right.

Britt took casey home, then she took me home, and we hung out in her car for a long time, talking, and listening to funny songs like adrians new skool country song, mine sucked, and then i finally showed brittany where i got the coo-coo-ka-choo from, i love coheed! It was an overall excellent time, that night totally showed me how incredibly great of a person brittany is, she is so much cooler than me. Casey quit! u rule! Hmmmm...lets see, about today....way hecktic for me. I had two, count um, two practices today, one with paladores, and one with tried and true. Two practices in one day is unheard of, i am dead tired. I practiced for a total of like 5 hours. 5 Hours!!! 5 hours of straight up drum action! that equals one tried drum lord, not even the nordic twilight could rejuvinate a weary soul such as mine, i feel like i have fought many battles over a fort-night, and i have a kings thirst for the frosty brew...haha, im ridiculous. And fighting with trish after practice didnt help either, she is so ridiculous!! (inserts hearty scream), it was all in fun though, i think....so after all that madness, i came back home, and that perty much leads me to now, if you dont count like the 4 hours of slumming around ive been doing. Not much happened in those 4 hours, mostly talked to some peeps, friend lacy called, it was good to hear from her, and britt told me she is in major relief girl mode, thats good cause heckticness is not as good as great. Now im bored, hence the long entry. o yeah, point to ponder, if you know it, dont say anything, but if you dont, try to figure it out, it took me and jeff a hearty while to get this one....ok......a man and his son are in a car accident, the father dies and the son is rushed to the hospital, when he gets there, the surgeon says,""i cant operate on this boy, this is my son."" How is this possible?......it took us forever to find that one out, i felt perty dumb, haha. ummm...lets see, i think thats about it, but one last thing, dedication time......a-hem.....i hereby dedicate this journal entry and all further journal entries to brittany, because it gives her something to read sometimes (horn sounds) do-do do dooooo!!! ok, im done for the night, peace fiends"

Then i left, only to find two more bundles of joy, casey and britt. We all went to jamies and hung out and had a really good time, then sneaky j showed up, o man!!! He said that jamies wife has to pass the Bar exam in order to marry him, it was the funniest thing ive ever heard. Im glad we went, cause sneaky j cheered Britt up some, and that made me really happy in turn. so then thats where my nite ends, now im here, being emo boy, just me and my computer screen and a half eaten slice of cold pizza. im out, time to create a rhapsody style melody, till next i see you in the nordic twilight...."

Heres how it happened....i applied one afternoon on one of those computer things, and from experience, i know those are a dead end. Then i got a call from them about 3 hours after i applied, since when does that happen? So then i show up there, and somehow get mixed up with a bunch of people who are gonna become techs there. Then i finally tell them im not there for that, and in doing that, i get an interview. So i go to the interview, then to a second one, and i kicked butt on both of them, i guess i can smooth talk when it comes down to it. And having done that, i recieve a job offer, all that in a matter of 3 days. It was outstanding. anyways, hmmm, last night everyone hung out and went to dennys, that was cool. then we all went to britts house and me and adrian played Heart Turns Black on her piano, it sounded way rad. Then i took Britt home...then went back to the other britts and they decided to go fire hunting, so we went driving around for like an hour looking for fire, but all we found was smoke. Then we went to a gas station so britt could fill up, and she got hit on by some guy running his game on her, it was funny. Then we took jill back home, and her sister somehow knew i had a tattoo, that was wierd. Jill made me some popcorn and it was delicious. Then we left and went back to britts house, and i hung out with her and her sisters for a while, they crack me up, its like a whole new world for me (p.s. Jasmine is hot, agege)....thats where the night ended, and now im here the day after all that madness. Britt is sad and it is really taking a toll on me. Britt if you read this, please cheer up, i love you. Having said that, i will sit here and continue to wait for 4 o clock to roll around so i can go to tried and true practice... love"

Umm, lets see, there was a trambapoline night a couple nights back, that was way fun even though i had to leave early and missed a fantabulous breakfast, o well, maybe one day. I had this odd thought the other night when i waited in line for the haunted house...its about hell. I was thinking about how its probley the worst and most terrorfying thing ever, so i tried to think what would be the worst and most terrorfying thing ever, heres what i came up with...what if hell was being chased for eternity by a crazy chainsaw wielding madman, texas chainsaw style, and never ceasing to be scared out of your skull...and eventually the madman catches up to you and does kill you by mortal human standards, and when you die, you forget the previous experiences and do it all over again, forever! That would be crappy by all accounts, thats why im happy im going to heaven, im not gonna get chased by a chainsaw maniac in heaven, haha, its so true. Besides my thoughts on hell, i dont have too much more to say...Britt isnt feeling that well, im praying for her and i hope she gets better. And jeremy, i do hope to be a level 12 master of the nordic twilight, rhapsody style, OH BABY!!! haha, aight then, im outta here, time to go shoot stuff with casey. Oh girl!!!"

"event","I did it, finally!!! I finally saw the texas chainsaw massacre!! Ok, i dont really care if you think im a wuss or not, but that movie scared the crap out of me. I dont think ill ever be the same after seeing that movie. I felt wierd walking out of that theatre, almost like a feeling of terror and/or disgust. And that is why i think that movie freakin ruled!! Any movie that can scare me like that has my instant respect. Besides watching a massacre, today was a rad day. Got up and went to practice which ruled, its coming together really well. Adrian got his junk annihilated by my sandal. We are talkin, dropping from 10 feet above the ground and most radically splitting his genitles in 2 separate but equal parts. It was outstanding. Then we came back and saw tha massacre. Went to albertos, met the casey and the britt there cause me and adrian were scared to be alone after the movie,haha. Then jamie, adam, jeremy, and rob showed up, and it made my whole night. It was robs birthday tayday. Happy birthday you stud, i love you. we all messed around and watched tha gas station guy run laps in his ghetto land speeder. and thats where the day ends, well, very well. haha, britt is talking to me tomarrow, im scared, i know its gonna be bad. britt, if you see this before tomarrow night, take it easy on me, ok? well, im spent, im gonna go curl up in my corner and pray that leatherface doesnt find me and gently place me on a meter long meat hook. i fare thee well...my young nordic warriors..."

God loves all kinds of music because He invented it all--fast and slow, loud and soft, old and new. You probably dont like it all, but God does! If it is offered to God in spirit and truth, it is an act of worship.""        Isnt that rad, that means God loves Metal!!! Given its played for him, but still, thats rad."

"event","I wish i were at a metal show right now, preferably an At the Gates show, but thats impossible, i would settle for anything. I just feeling like seeing 20 to 40 kids having fun and knocking eachother senseless all in good fun. Is a little mayhem too much to ask?! Anyways, i got up early today, which is extremely rare, especially because i have no job right now. I also went on a job hunt, i got all these applications from ridiculous places like American Eagle and the Gap, haha, with no hope at all, i just thought it would be funny if by some miricle i did get hired. I got called back to Best Buy and i got an interview on friday, hopefully that goes well, im gonna be prayin on that one, i need a job now! After my job hunt, i went down to Britts, but could only stay for like... i dont know, it was probley like 6 or 7 minutes. My apologies Britt, my mom went ampo on me. She got me all hecktic and made me go to Stater Bros. for water, it was not fun. O yeah, i found a cool quote in this book that Britt got me for my birthday(different Britt than the Britt mentioned above, what are the odds that they would have the same name?). Ill put the quote up on a separate entry to make it less hecktic up in hurr. So until then, i bid thee a good morrow my loves."

"event","Howdy cow(boys/girls), havent posted in a while. Partly cause i couldnt, and partly because i didnt want to. Anyways, im over all the getting kicked out nonsense, and that is exactly what it was, nonsense. I guess getting yelled at for 4 hours does that. its cool though, i got my truck, and most of my freedom, so im all good. Plus i really benefited spiritually from being away. Ok, recap of the day time, hmmmm(ponders) i got up, and i ate a hamburger, it was scrumpulescent! then i watched Jesus, the movie, it was perty cool. Then i proceeded to rid my filthy truck of all of its filth, it looks perty shnazzy now i must say. then i drove out to church, it was the first time ive driven in like 5 days, thats a lot for me, it felt kinda wierd. i picked up casey and took off to church. It was perty cool, that room was too small though, hot breath action everywhere!!! haha. We met up with Britt, Britt and Jill there, they rule, i love them all so incredibly much. We did the usual in-n-out afterward, always fun, even with the fry tossing action. i gave myself a 5-hour tattoo on my wrist that said no one gets out alive, with a skull, it was perty metal, like Rhapsody, haha, ask. Me and Casey then left, and i said bye to all my brothers and sisters. Tonight i decided im gettin a tattoo, it will rule you! O man!!! i just found out that casey accepted God tonight!!! i am the happiest man alive right now, this is such an answered prayer!!! I love you Casey!! my home-boy!! well, i dont have much else to talk about so im out, I love You :^)"

"event","Okay, my birthday was a couple days ago, but i gotta talk about it now cause i havent had a chance. I swear, i have the best friends in the world, they full on made my birthday the best ever. okay, the first thing i did on my birthday was wake up, of course, but after that, i met up with the brittanys at in-n-out and they treated me to a fantabulescent lunch, and it was mad fun hangin out with them, they rule. afterwards, we went to a couple places and then they took off. From there, i went to Barnes and Nobles and picked up a copy of Beowulf and The Inferno. Freakin metal books! Then i went to best buy and got the Anberlin cd and the new Switchfoot...boys speak in rhythm, and girls in code, do do do do, do do do do....sorry, Anberlin is too freakin catchy, haha. Then i proceeded to The Punisha practice, too long of a story, ill just say it didnt happen, haha. Then i went home, and then went to jamies. He made me a birthday pizza, it ruled. Then we watched falling down, one of the most violent movies ive seen, its perty funny though. That was about it for that day, but it was seriously one of the funnest days of my life, seeing all my friends was straight up awesome. Then yesterday was the Punisha show, i sucked it up so bad, but i had a lot of fun. Then the vegans ruined the show, i always knew something was wierd about them vegans, haha. Then we all flocked to albertos in menifee, and i had a most triumphant california burrito, excellence! Then we flocked to brandons and hung out. we watched resident evil, probley my favorite movie of all time, only because im such a resident evil nerd, i know it all. Haha, britt got really scared, it was funny. then we all went home. now im here, and the shin-dig is tonight. it will rule you. hope to see you there! love and peace, cello*"

"event","Aight, ill start this one off with a recap of my day, then ill get to the good stuff...ok, got up and went to work for 9 hours. i took my a-cew-stick to work and played for my lunch, it was fun. Got home, and went out with adrian and casey to chuck e. cheeses to see steve, and we got kicked out cause the chick that worked there gave us free tokens, haha. We then proceeded to the bowling alley, saw jenn and katy and got free preztels and mr. pibb...then we hung out with jake and his buddy. then we left, thats about it...ok the good stuff. Ive done a little thinking over the last couple days, and i wanna share my thoughts. ready?! THOUGHT 1) Pain - Here is my new thoughts on pain, and by pain, i mean physical pain, like, ooouch, my elbow!! See, the other day, i was pulling out an amp for adrian to borrow and in doing so, i sliced some of my pinky flesh off on a metal corner of another amp. My pinky started to hurt, and i was trying to find a way to deal with the pain. I come to the conclusion that my pain is nothing, nothing at all, when compared to the extreme amount of pain Jesus must have gone through, so therefore, there is no use fretting over nothing. so there you go, no more pain!! ok, second thought... THOUGHT 2) Winning Jersey - I thought about how winning jersey came and went in retrospect, and i was thinking that WJ breaking up wasnt just a bunch of accidents at one time, but instead that God destroyed WJ for a reason. WJ/Scarlet, whatever you wanna call it, was at its most popular when our music was original and pure, and it was also at this time that the focus of the band was solely on God. When the focus came off of God and more toward ourselves, our music got weaker and the band slowly fell apart, ultimately ending in the bands demise. Good call on Gods part for destroying it all, we werent really playing for the right reasons anymore. And now God has blessed me with another band where God is the main focus, and i am much more pleased with the music we are creating. Ok, i had one more thought, but i cant remember it at the moment, if i think of it, ill put it up. haha, im a nerd. I feel like im writing a novel, so im gonna stop now. God Bless yall"

I finally got adrain to go, i love that kid. everyone else was there...adrina, jamie, adam, rob, levi, mike, trish, brandy....but no jeff and sneaky j...they really missed out. i read my swedish endowment tale to everyone at the table, i think they liked it. trish lashed out at me and jumped on me at church...that was....outstanding, cause it exposed my white, hairy leg mass...simply fantabulousecent(ya like that one britt? haha). anyway, im in a way better mood now, i just pray it lasts through the week. cant wait for the punisha show, ive never played straight-up hardcore live before, it will rawk! the coolest part about it is doing the point of recognition cover song with an actual member from point of reck playing guitar!!! it will be fantasticly exciting.

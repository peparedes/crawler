"event","i want so desperately to know that i mean something to you. anything. anything more than just a pretty face, or a casual friend, or someone you've got to keep an eye on so they take care of themselves. i want to be special to you. there must be something you see in me that you don't see somewhere else.

i think i know in my heart that you love me, but i want to hear you say it. and i want to know why."

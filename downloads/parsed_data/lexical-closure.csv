When the government in question is the government that would have received any classified information, according to what Iran is saying the charges are, why would that government need to see the indictment to make a judgment? I mean, the State Department might be lying, or not know for sure (through not asking or whatever - but it's certainly not <em>laughable</em> to think our government wouldn't know, somewhere, whether this journalist is actually a spy.

At a high school with a grand total of 509 students. The rule they broke was that they're supposed to go straight in to the cafeteria after parking their cars. The justification for this rule was ""sometimes kids do drugs or make out in their cars""

So bust the kids that do drugs or make out in their cars. Seriously. ""You get detention because you're standing in the parking lot"" just seems so insane to me.

"event","My deal-card function is basically a Knuth shuffle spread out over multiple calls to the deal-card routine. E.G. (shuffle-deck deck) just resets the card count, the actual ""shuffling"" is done by deal-card.

I originally implemented this by making my deck type a vector with a fill pointer - the fill pointer being the means to hide the already dealt cards in the deck. In other words, I'd grab a random number from 0 to the fill pointer (which is (random 53) for a newly allocated deck, making the range 0-52 inclusive, exactly what we want for a proper Knuth shuffle), get the new fill pointer value (one less than whatever it was before), and do the card swap, returning whatever card was at the random offset we picked.

This worked great - but when I told the compiler to be fast, it started complaining about not being able to optimize away a call to one of SBCL's internal access functions.

; note: unable to
;   optimize
; due to type uncertainty:
;   The first argument is a (VECTOR FIXNUM 52), not a SIMPLE-ARRAY.

<lj-cut text=""Stuff always gets longer"">The problem is that (make-array 52 :element-type 'card) returns an array of type (simple-array FIXNUM (52)), while (make-array 52 :element-type 'card :fill-pointer 52) returns an array of type (vector fixnum 52). The fill pointer makes the array not simple (in accordance with the language spec).

So with the fill pointer, the function disassembly contains calls to SB-KERNEL:%DATA-VECTOR-AND-INDEX all over the place - basically, anywhere I called aref. I initially thought I just wasn't being smart enough to declare the types right (and this might be true), but I found old mailing list stuff saying you can't get rid of that note, or the calls.

Yet an aref on a (simple-array FIXNUM (52)) compiles down with no function calls at.

This is what I get for trying to be tricky. So i got trickier. If I allocate a 53 card array without a fill pointer, and treat offset zero as space to hold my ""fill pointer"", I get back a simple array - which SBCL will optimize nicely.

So I end up with something like this:

<pre>
(defun deal-card (deck)
  ""Return a random card from the deck.""
  ;; This is effectively a Fisher-Yates/Knuth shuffle spread out over 
  ;; multiple calls, using a psuedo ""fill-pointer"" to maintain state
  ;; Originally this actually used the fill pointer, but non-simple arrays
  ;; mean function calls to SB-KERNEL:%DATA-VECTOR-AND-INDEX under SBCL :/
  (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0) (compilation-speed 0))
           (type deck deck))
  (macrolet ((fpointer (deck) `(aref ,deck 0))  ;; 'fill-pointer' like syntax
             (prandom (count) `(1+ (random ,count)))) ;; Handle the random right
    (let* ((fpointer (fpointer deck))
           (newpointer (1- fpointer)))
      (declare (type (integer 0 53) newpointer fpointer))
      (if (zerop newpointer) (error ""No cards left in the deck!"")
          (let ((index (prandom newpointer)))
            (declare (type (integer 0 53) index))
            (let ((card (aref deck index))
                  (newcard (aref deck newpointer)))
              (setf (fpointer deck) newpointer
                    (aref deck index) newcard
                    (aref deck newpointer) card)))))))
</pre>

That compiles down to code where the only function calls are to update the random state (because the range is so small on the random call, the actual function call to the mersenne twister gets optimized away) and to error if the user ever calls it when the deck is dead. 

Sixty-one assembly instructions. This makes me happy.

Although it might be interesting to figure out what I'd need to change to get SBCL to be able optimize the calls away with the fill-pointer version ..

"event","I converted http://www.suffecool.net/poker/evaluator.html to Common Lisp code. Instead of looping/recursing over all 21 seven-card hand combinations, I wrote a macro to expand to what is basically an unrolled loop that checks them all and returns the best value. I have implementations of both versions, the original binary-search version, and the faster perfect hash version. The hash function depends on 32 bit word overflow occurring (but ignores the overflow bit), so I had to (ldb (byte 32 0) ...) around any calls to + in the hash function to get it to work.

Using a test function that loops over every possible five-card hand, the perfect hash version evaluates them all in about one second - most of that is hash-table accesses to keep the hand statistics. The binary search version takes a little over two seconds.

Now that I have that evaluator, I'm pondering converting the 2+2 evaluator as well, assuming I can write code to generate the lookup tables correctly. (The code for that evaluator is dead simple, and the card representation is just a positive integer less than 52)"

Douglas Adams is someone who I wish were still around writing things. Or just generally being Douglas Adams.

I don't know. It's hard to think of people. They're all people who did awesome things and I wish were still around to do more awesome things.

Although, I usually am going to see fairly well known bands, who would probably get mobbed - and the place was indeed packed - but Frontalot was out in the audience during other people's sets, etc. I just dig that, that they're there to play and have fun, and watch, and it's about what they're doing ... hell, I don't know if I'm explaining that well. I just didn't get a vibe that there was any kind of separation at all - no ""You are the people who came to see us"" and ""We are the people you came to see"" wall. I don't know how to explain it better than that - it was almost like a living room/backyard show at someone's house, just with a lot more people. I seriously loved that about the show."

Over the last year, there have been times that I've read a paper, or a website, by a professor at this or that university, and had a question, or a comment. (Most recently about Richard Lenski's paper regarding E. Coli evolving the ability to process citrate)

So I send a polite email, with the comment and/or question. Every single time I've done that, I've been replied to, with an answer about the question, or a little bit of chatter about the comment I made.

Every. Single. Time. 

Tell me that's not awesome? Before the internet, would a guy like me, who has no academic ties or contacts at all, never been to college, been able to get an answer to this or that question from the author of the paper directly, within a day or so? Nope.

Well, I guess I could phone, but what are the odds they'd even put me through to the professor?"

a) The universe is a simulation
b) Quantum outcomes are determined according to the probabilities of quantum mechanics and a random number generator.

I'm basically wondering if we could devise an experiment that could show us if the RNG posited by b were a psuedorandom number generator. What would we look for? Evidence of a period, maybe?

If we watched a bit of carbon-14 decay for long enough, maybe the interval between events might eventually repeat itself? (Although, that would probably require one PRNG for whatever chunk of carbon we were watching ... which isn't a very likely implementation of a simulation, and even if things were implemented that way, we'd have to figure out which bits of carbon were all using hte same PRNG, which doesn't sound like something we'd be able to figure out to begin with ...)

He said stuff like ""Don't skate that, you're gonna hurt yourself"" ... and I responded with ""Are you going to try it?"" ... and he said ""No"" and skated off.

Last night, I dreamt I was street skating, and tried a couple wallrides on a little bank to wall thing, and didn't land them. When I got to wherever it was I was going (which seemed to be somewhere in San Francisco, I vaguely remember skating across the bay bridge and it taking forever), <em>that same little kid was there</em>, on his roller blades, asking me why I even tried the wallrides when I couldn't land them.

So I said ""Well, if I didn't try it, I'd never be able to land it ... can you get up on the wall? Have you tried?""

"event","One thing I will never quite understand is why people talk landslide when the projected margins aren't actually of a landslide scale.

I mean, the last two elections, people on certain boards I frequent were talking about how it was a ""landslide victory"", when, if you really look at the numbers, they were both the smallest margins of victory in a presidential election back to at least the year I was born.

And this morning, I saw an article from a paper in a <em>foreign country</em> talking about 'early election results show landslide for Obama' when it's pretty obvious that it's not nearly time to be talking about early election results ... I mean, east coast precincts don't close for how many more hours?

And Gallup on Monday said 53-42% Obama, and that's supposed to be a landslide, according to various articles I'm looking at now.

Come on, news media people. The 1980 election wasn't a landslide because of the voting percentage (which was actually fairly narrow, 50% -> 41%), but because Reagan took 90% of the electoral votes. The 1984 election was similarly a landslide because of electoral vote percentage, not popular vote percentages. There hasn't really been an election since that's a ""landslide"" on that scale (although the 1988 election came close)

So I think it's sort of silly to talk 'landslide' at the moment. Just do me a favor and wait, you know?"

"event","I wrote a little genetic algorithm, just to play with genetic algorithms. The population consists of armies in Colonel Blotto's Game -> http://www.amsta.leeds.ac.uk/~pmt6jrp/personal/blotto.html

The 'genome' is basically a hundred element vector, each element containing a value between 0 and 9. This is converted in to a ten-element 'army' with the following function:

<pre>
(defun genome->blotto (genome)
  ""Return a blotto vector with the army assignments represented by the genome""
  (let ((blotto (make-array 10 
                            :element-type '(integer 0 100) 
                            :initial-element 0)))
    (dotimes (n 100 blotto)
      (incf (aref blotto (aref genome n))))))
</pre>

This lets me 'mutate' by randomly selecting one element of the genome and assigning a random value from 0 to 9. The crossover function selects a random half of each parent genome and copies to the child, with a random chance of mutating the child after the crossover occurs (right now, that chance is about half a hundredth of a percent - and parents are never mutated)

<lj-cut text=""This got longer and wider than I'd meant it to get"">
Every generation, a tournament is run, every player against every other player, and the population is stable sorted based on a comparison function that first comparing score, then wins, then draws, then how many generations the player has survived. The bottom 20% of the population is replaced by new players created through crossover. (The population size is 500, so 100 new players are created every turn).

I started a run last night, with an initial population consisting solely of genomes that had the values 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... repeated until the end of the genome array (this creates an army distribution of 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10). This population doesn't just require a single mutation for something different to catch. One single mutation can't create a new army that beats the original army - it requires <em>one mutated army to mutate such that it beats another mutated army</em> - we need at least two mutations in a single generation for that to happen. If I understand the math on that correctly, the probability of getting two or more mutations in one hundred tries is something a tiny bit over one hundred thousandth of a percent (probability 1.237095823513552e-7, if I stuck the correct numbers into http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/binomialX.html) - and that doesn't even factor in that even when that happens, there's only about a 10% chance for any individual mutation to mutate such that it beats the first mutation. It took about 8-10k generations before any non-original player got pushed up above the kill line.

This happens when one army gets mutated from all-10s into, say:
10 11 10 10 10 10 9 10 10 10

And a second army gets mutated from all-10s into an army that loses against the first - say
10 10 10 9 10 10 11 10 10 10

The generation after, the first sequence will have displaced a single all-10s player in the set of survivors.
 
Once one differing sequence gets in, the probabilities get better - 

10 11 10 10 10 10 9 10 10 10 can be mutated into
10 11 10 10 11 10 8 10 10 10, which beats an all-ten distribution, and will likely force the all-ten distribution into extinction once it starts reproducing.

I left it running all night, set to die when the number of genes that have the original values is down to 10% of the total number of genes in the population.

I woke up this morning to this (I slapped a cl-ncurses interface over the whole thing, the code for the interface isn't that elegant but works just fine):

Dev = The standard deviation of the scores. The way the game is scored, you always get the same average, so this may not mean much
Unq = The number of unique genomes. This tends to stay stable for a while, then jump up while things are shifting, then drop down again.
Pct = The percentage of individual genes in the population that have the value of the original, generation 0 genes.

It's pretty boring to watch when nothing is happening - but it's fun to watch when 4-7 different genomes are getting in there, and they're fighting it out to see who goes extinct ... but mostly it's just running in the background and I check it every so often to see what it looks like."

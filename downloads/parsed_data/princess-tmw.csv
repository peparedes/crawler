Its harder than what I thought it would be b/c you have to do a whole bunch of stuff, but it was just my first day so everything was kinda overwhelming. In a week or so it will not be so crazy! The best part...I get to tan for free!!!! I absolutely love that part! My skin is getting nice and brown and gorgeous! =) *dont get any thoughts hehehe* 
I think there is an animal or something in my chimney. I keep hearing weird noises from it, like something is moving around in it. 
Seth wrecked his new car...=( yeah...i know i know...but...thigns are working out for him. The insurance man came today to look at it and tell him if it was totaled or not. Seth doesnt think that it will be totaled. Am I spelling that word right? anyways...hopefully its not. Then it will get fixed, and then he will come down for Valentines!! Yeah!! *Insert happy dancer here* well...im off to change....mmmm....i smell all coconutty from the tanning lotion =) did I mention that I love it!!!!"

I would love to work with children, but...I like my job now, and the one I will get at the tanning bed =) have i mentioned that yet??? Tanning bed! Hehe...free tans....but...i want to use them, but there are some people who dont want me to b/c i'll get skin cancer and die and all that unhappy stuff. but i figure it this way...im gonna die anyways...so why have people at my funeral say...""im so sad that she's gone, but atleast she had a killer tan?!?"" hehe killer tan hehe...i crack myself up. ok that was cheesy...anyways...im waiting to leave for work. I have time to kill and im bored! i've watched all the episodes of ER, and Dawson's Creek uses too many big words, that I frankly have no idea what they mean. I wish it would snow. Its cold enough too!!! I want my drive way to ice over like it did that one year, and we all went skating err well...slipping and falling on it =) I got a call from some of my friends out in Idaho. Kinda awkward b/c one was a guy I used to date. He misses me a lot, but...Im happy with my Seth =) ahhh....Seth =) he's just great. and very handsome, my mom commented on this the other day which scared me, b/c I dont want my mom thinking my boyfriend is cute! off that subject...i need chocolate!"

I got that whole sporty chick thing going on. I got hit on by customers too. It was kinda weird, b/c most of them were business guys on their lunch breaks, but still...eeww...no thanks...i have my seth, and i love him =) second...reason why i havent been posting...is b/c i've been out looking for a job...third...im lazy. yes i know its a hard fact to consider that i, being the person with more energy than anyone i know, can get lazy, but yes, even the greatest of us do slip at times. =) anyways...i just got home, and im tired and hungry, although i have lost five pounds so...i might just skip the food for right now =)"

Seeing all the teen guys trying to hit on the teen girls, but not wanting their friends to know that they actually like girls now. It was crazy!! But, I did get my new years kiss... aaahhhh....and even though i hate to admit it, mom's can be right sometimes... and we'll just leave it at that..ok...so one of my new years resolutions is to write in this thing more. i know i know i've said that a million times, but this time im actually going to do it! and...i start teaching again next week.

ok...a bit of venting now i believe is in order...
I CLEANED THE KITCHEN AGAIN!!! i dont mind, its just that i would rather have it so that my roommate Henna and I arent always the ones cleaning the apartment!!! there are four girls in here...myself, henna, and then two sisters. One of them, the older one, makes me feel like im incompetent to do anything!! Everything I do or say or attempt, is not right, nor good enough!! I can't stand it!! Then the other one, the younger one, has NO SENSE of privacy. If im in my room working on homework, or a project for school, or just playing around on the internet, I DONT WANT SOMEONE BEHIND ME WATCHING OVER MY SHOULDER AT EVERYTHING I DO!!!! Oh!! did i mention the fact that they wake you up for every stinking event that happens on this earth?!?! I mean think about it....if its 7:00 in the morning and you dont have a class until ten, DO NOT WAKE ME UP FOR A TELEMARKETER!!! any sane person would feel the same way!! grrrrr....
happy things now!! Its only a week and one day until I see Nick!!! Im soo excited about that!! He is just great =)

She gave me some migraine mediciene, but I did not like that at all. It made me feel all funny and worse than I did before, so I go back tomorrow to see what else she can do. 
I saw the BEST concert last night. It was this group called ""The Ten Tenors"" go to their website...www.thetentenors.com.....they are amazing!!! Somewhere on that site you can listen to their music. They were soo funny!! And they could sing really good. I loved it!! Afterwards my roommate and I got their autographs. They are all from Austrailia, so I had one of them say my name in an Austrailian accent. It sounded really cool!!

But...its all good because I only have a year left and then I'm done!! Im off to the dr. today. Im soooo stubborn when it comes to those people. I have this major headahce that hasnt gone away for like 2 weeks, and its really starting to mess with my eyes. I wear the glasses and what not...not b/c they help but b/c they make me look smarter!! =) I just have completely NO ENERGY!! Its kinda scary b/c I dont know whats going on and I dont want to think of the bad things, but its all that I can think about...
Onto more happy things....
I went to the coolest place the other weekened. Its called the ice caves. That place was soooo fun!! You have like 2 feet of space literally between you and the ice and the top of the cave. Its a blast! You go caving through the ice. I think it was a underground waterfall once, that just froze underground. After you squeeze through the caves, you get to this huge waterfall of ice at the end and you can rope climb to the top and then slide down. Its soo fun!! Getting there is half the fun b/c you have to 4wheel out to the caves. We only got stuck once, and then we had to pull this dimpy little blazer that didnt have four wheel drive out of the mud. 
Anyways...I have come to realize that I have fallen in love with this bare state of Idaho. I seriously never thought that I would...but its a part of me now. I'll be sad to leave at Christmas time. But...Im also excited to go home!! I get to eat southern food again!! I talked to my mom the other day on the phone and she sounds sooooo southern!! I have completely lost my accent, so I can't believe I ever talked like her!!

"event","Last night our group went to the sand dunes. They are soooo much fun!!! First it was fun to squeeze 6 people into a tiny nissan sentra. I ended up laying across the people in the backseat. The dunes are amazing. The stars were even more amazing. I saw stars twinkle for the first time. It was so beautiful! The sky was so clear so when you would lay back on the sand you could look up at the stars and see forever. You could see the milky way. There were millions of shooting stars. They were awesome. We let Sam and Mark go off b/c they needed some time alone, and Bonnie, Rylan, Nick and I were on the top of this major high dune. Rylan started telling us ghost stories, but not the fantasy one. He had this one that actually happened to him and it freaked us out soooo bad. Bonnie and I ended up in each others arms scared to death. At one point in his story he looked in the distance like he saw something and then looked back at us, and then looked away again. He was like, ""you guys we need to move down"". At first I thought he was trying to scare us, but then he got this look on his face like nothing i've seen before. he told us again that we needed to move from that spot that we were sitting at. Then Nick agreed that we didnt need to be there in that spot and we moved down to the middle of the dune. I dont know what Rylan saw but I do know that he saw something. He's one of those people that has that sixth sense, and dont think im crazy, b/c I know everyone at some point in their life has felt ""something"". It was the scariest thing I had ever experienced. I know that Rylan saw something out in the distance, and I know he was right to tell us to move down b/c whatever it was wasnt good. 
ANYWAYS.....on to happier things. hee hee hee. I had soo much fun there. It just felt right. I love being out here and I love the friends I have out here. I've never really had the whole ""group of friends"" thing back home. So out here having that as a part of my life is amazing! I love it!!! aight....im off to go to a water park with everyone today!!

I so miss kissing! last night we were all in the lounge talking about our first kiss and what not, and i realized that i havent kissed anyone in like 2 months or so and im not liking that! and then i realized that a bunch of girls up here have virgin lips! thats crazy! well...in a way i guess its kinda sweet maybe that they have waited to kiss someone special, but all my kisses were special..lol...anyways....im really missing having a *significant other* here to hold hands with and cuddle and all that good stuff...
diff sub! i took my first exam the other day. I was one point away from a B!!! I was so mad! I dont make C's on tests. I'll definitely do better ont he next one. Tonight is Abs night at the gym. My roommates and I are determined to get in shape..me maybe a little more  than them. I have a goal for the end of August...hopefully i'll reach it."

"event","well...my friends and i had one of those experiences that you read about in newspapers where they found the kids dead a week later. We went to this cute little swimming hole where there is this cool waterfall you can jump off of and what not. It was sooo much fun! then about 8 of us decided to explore the area and go down this little creek thing. we had 2 of those little raft things, so there were four of us on each raft. at first it was really fun. we were all talking and laughing and what not, and then the water got really fast and really hard. The current was sooo heavy on us. the water was only like a foot deep, but the current was so hard and the rocks were so sharp and stuff that it was really scary. we all got seperated and were just kinda thrown down the river about a mile or so. at first, i was like...ok i can deal with this...it wont be to bad. but then i just freaked and lost it. it was so scary knowing that you had no control over what was happening to you, that you didnt know what was coming up, and you didnt know if you were going to go over a waterfall or not. it was the scariest thing ever. at one point my friend kate was able to stop herself on a rock and she grabbed me. we like held onto each other for dear life and were crying and screaming. then i got pushed off of her by the water. seriously...if you're reading this and thinking...it was only a foot deep why didnt they just stand up?? the current was so hard on us that it was to hard to stop and stand. i kept trying to grab rocks and put my feet down but either the rocks were to pointy and sharp, or they moved from underneath me. Finally, the current slowed and we were able to get out to the side of the water and onto some rocks. they were sooo HOT b/c of the sun. then people started seeing rattle snakes and i completely lost it. like i wouldnt move...im soo SCARED of snakes its crazy. we saw a road like in the distance and decided that was our best bet. 2 girls ran back the mile and half to the swimming place to get a car to meet us on the road. we had to get back in the water where the current was slow and swim across the river to get to the road. it was so scary. when we got home and were all able to calm down, it hit us of how much danger we were all actually in. we knew it was a bad situation, but later that day, we realized just what could have happened to us. I tried to take a shower to relax and it was a scary thing. I turned around to let the water get the shampoo out of my hair and the water hitting my face freaked me out b/c it was like earlier that day in the river. everyone is just like all sunburned really bad and covered in bruises and scrapes. valuable lesson...never go exploring on rivers in Idaho!!!"

"event","well...i just woke up! its about 12 in idaho. we got home so late last night! curfew is at 1 in the dorms that i live in..so we got home at 1 but stayed up so late! and then i couldnt sleep very good...crazy dreams...anyways....diff subject...the actual dance...it was really fun. i doubled/tripled with 2 of my roommates. the guys had fun on the scavenger hunt that led to the picnic. my date was this guy kirby. he was fun to go with. he kept spinning me while we were dancing, and i got so dizzy! before the real dance, they had these polynesian/hawaiian dancers come perform for us. they were AMAZING!! the dancers tried to teach the audience how to hula. i have come to the realization that being a hula dancers is not in future for me! :) back to kirby..he was fun to go with, but like it was soooo COLD! and i was FREEZING!!! I had on one of those sarong things....those wrap around hawaiian skirts...and it was not very thick!! i was so cold! he gave me his jacket which was a nice thing to do.. but then like whenever i would move closer to him...just for the body warmth...nothing else!!! he would move away like 2 feet! and then on the way home, he walked like a foot ahead of me! its not like i wanted anything ""to come of it"" b/c i didnt, but still i paid 15 dollars for those tickets and i asked him b/c it was a sadie hawkins type dance, so he should have atleast walked next to me! i got so sad b/c i missed seth. it was just really kind of depressing. i was like...im really cold...seth would hold me...
ok diff sub....there is another dance coming up in a couple weeks. and this time its a normal one, like where the guys ask the girls. im already getting antzy (i hope thats a word) about it. im seriously planning on that i wont get asked. before i came out here, everyone was like..you'll get asked out on the first day...and you'll have so many guys want to date you...and im not seeing it!!!! seriously...my roommate has been asked out on 3 dates already and had a guy send her flowers!! i know im not ugly..but really..where is the love?? (ok that last part sounded really corny, just overlook it):) one of my other roommates feels the EXACT same way i do..its so frustrating....
alright..enough venting...im going to some dorm beach party thing...and then im going to eat..and then sleep...and i'll study sometime in there...."

"event","We got in washington late Sunday night. It felt like it took forever to cross states like Idaho, and Wyoming. In some places they were soooooo pretty, but in other places, they were just boring. We (my family) will be here until next tues, when we drive to idaho to take me to school.

Today i went to these things called the ape caves. look it up on the internet. its sooo cool! you hike through these caves underground where lava used to flow. at some places you have to manuever (sp?) your way up and above and round these huge piles of boulders and lava rocks. Its sooo dark in there. when your flashlights are turned off, you can't see your hand in front of your face. it was scary at first, but then i got used to it. we hiked underground for about a mile and a half. it was sooo cold! i think it gets down to like 42 degrees or something down there. it took us about 2 hours to hike through the caves. then we had to hike above ground back to the car. there was this really cool lookout spot where you could see Mt. St. Helens. it was sooo pretty! you could see skiers coming down the side of the mountain. i would totally reccomend going to the ape caves if you find yourself in the southern part of washington state, or the northern part of oregon, whichever you prefer:) 

i got really homesick in idaho. but i called seth, and i felt a lot better after that. I miss him so much! we decided not to tell each other that we missed each other.....its a good idea, but its just hard!! im so far away from him! if you've ever been in love and had to be far away from them, you know what i mean. its like your heart hurts b/c you can't see them or hold them. 

ok...enough sad stuff...i dont know where they keep the kleneex here. :( tomorrow we are going to mt st helens, and then i think on thursday we are going to the beach, and then saturday to portland. they have this really cool thing called saturday's market down there. its like a bunch of hippies. we went a few years ago. there was this guy who paints himself completely blue and sits there and every once in awhile he'll change positions. its neat! 

im off to take a nap. im soo exhausted from hiking, and my everything hurts!"

im getting all excited about leaving. i really want to just be out there. im excited for the fall to come and i can see real snow and not just the mushy ice stuff that we get here. i've already met a handful of people out there, via internet. so...at least i kind of know someone out there. im not worried anymore about fitting in, or stuff like that. i cant wait to ""decorate"" my dorm room. yeah...i know they're tiny and all, but i want to like set it up and what not. i am scared b/c we have lofted beds. like where its the top of a bunk bed and then underneath it is where you have your computer desk and what not. i tend to take up the whole bed here at home, and so im like...what if i fall out of the bed?! i guess thats just another journal entry:)

Seth and I are still great! I still miss him like crazy. its like right now, I wish i could just drive and see him b/c its only about 3 hrs away. i could just pack up and go, but when im out west, it will be further, and not as easy to just drive and see him. there was something he said he wanted to talk to me about in my online journal. so hopefully, he'll read this and remember what he wanted to ask me! 

omg! i saw that movie gothika the other night! I have been sleeping with the lamp on in my room for the past 2 nights. it freaked me out!! for those of you who saw that movie and it didnt get to you....YOU DEFINITELY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS!!!

now on to the frustrating news.....

there is some stupid virus or something out there that has changed all the passwords to everything! seriously!! everyone in my family has lost their password to all their stuff. i can't even get into my college account!! its soo crazy!

i have about 8 days left in south carolin. im sooo freaked out!! like...i keep wondering if i'll fit in out there. but everytime i ask someone, i always get the same answer ""of course you will! you're beautiful, talented, and smart and all the guys will want to date you and you'll fit in perfectly esp b/c you have a cute southern accent"".(which I have failed to recognize) i sooo still have to pack! I dont wanna! im not the organized person who likes that kinda thing. I really wish that it were like 5 years from now and i have already been through college and am married to the love of my life ;)

on a more serious note, i really now have to ""buckle down"" and start thinking about my future. im good in school....i may lack some common sense, but im pretty smart. but...this is college! like at my first year in college, i did pretty well...i went to a local tech college just to get the general stuff out of the way. but..i did pretty good...until i found out some REALLY big news right before the stupid finals and bombed EVERY one of them! that sooo shot my GPA way DOWN! and there is more serious stuff I have to think about with Seth, like his mission and when he goes and what not. like...we have to have the dreaded....""serious talk"". i want him to go on a mission...i want nothing more than to say...""i have a missionary!"" or to have him tell our kids about the cool stuff he did on his mission. i just know i will MISS him sooo BAD! he is far away from me now, by 3 hours....but in a week he will be far away from my by a thousand miles. :( 

i sooo have to like loose some of this after baby weight. its killing me! like all my before bella clothes dont fit anymore! I still have my figure and all, but my waist is sooo not what it used to look like. i dont want to be like those teeny tiny girls, but i do want MY old figure back! I've been thinking about trying something this week...so we'll see how that works out!

i leave for idaho in about a week! I soo have to pack things! like, i so want to go out west, but like will i do crazy things? for instance, I was doing crazy things like partying and what not, and then i had a HUGE reality check, and i was a ""good girl"" for a while. seriously! i was! but...i guess one will never know until they try. 

and...i miss bella like crazy! i havent gotten any pics or anything from them for a while, but they just moved far away, so thats kinda expected that things are crazy for them right now. but like...i so want to see her. the other day i saw sami driving around town and it was soooo weird to see him and know that our daughter is not here, but somewhere else. i know she's with the family she needs to be, but i just miss her. her little tiny chubby fingers and toes and her cute little fat baby smile! like i know that when i held her i memorized everything about her. but she'll never remember what it was like to be held by me.

diff subject! dont feel like getting all emotional this early! well...its 10:30...that early enough for me! Seth came down the past weekend. it was sooooooo fun! it was like...hm....how do i explain...life was complete. hm...its like i was complete. like i had my other half..it was so neat! we had soooo much fun! just being crazy and what not;)
we went to six flags on saturday...it was all rainy and stuff, but they reopened some of the rides so it was fun. i totally learned that neither of us know how to read a stupid amusement park map to find out where rides are.

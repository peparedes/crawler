Have no clue what I'm doing romantically. I think I know what i should be doing but old feelings die hard as well as old memories.  This is gonna be one of those days where I wish I could have stayed in bed.

I went and had food with joe, kristyn and fran at golden castle. 

they're at delaware park right now while i'm just chillin here listening to the spice girls greatest hits through myspace. 

i did one of those things i kept saying no to...i joined Facebook so in addition to being a myspace social ho, i can be a facebook social ho too. LoL. 

Life is up and down. there are aspects that are great and aspects that aren't so good. I'm on vacation. it's been nice. i have two more days and then I go back on Tuesday.  

I feel like a lot of stuff is unclear and in turmoil but that i'm just sitting and rolling with the punches.   I don't know what I want right now.  

i'm just taking it day to day and we'll see what tomorrow brings.

I just got a new computer, the primary one in our apartment broke recently so I went out to Best Buy and shelled out some dough to get a new one.  

I have to feed the WoW addiction perhaps? :) 

Life is going okay. I've been going to shows and getting out a little bit. 

2009 started out rough but it's getting better and i'm definitely learning that I need my friends right now and with them, i'm unstoppable. 

I got to talk to someone I haven't really talked to much lately and that felt good. Hopefully we'll still talk a little more very soon. 

Love life is quiet as it has been for a little bit but sometimes it doesn't bother me. It'd be nice but i don't know if anything is worth all the effort i usually try and put out. 

More to come soon hopefully."

I play WoW a lot but as I played tonight I realize a lot of the reason I play is for the social gaming.  None of my local friends (on my server) are on...none of my server friends are on and i'm still pissed off from an earlier encounter today. 

The mall is crazy at christmas time. Working 4:30-1am saturday, 12-8:30pm sunday and 4:30-1am on Monday.

Nothing particularly special going on. I check on this at least once a week now. I've been reading my friends posts but not posting anything. 

Work is full time, getting ready for the new store in less then a month. Excited about that. I've been going to a bunch of shows. MSI and Birthday Massacre, Wednesday 13 twice. 

I'm going to Wizard World on May 31st, Kaiju Big Battel on June 1st, Dark Lotus on June 18th, Counting Crows on August 9th and Rockstar Mayhem on August 15th. Green Jelly is also likely on July 12th. 

Comic-con and a trip to Cali is planned for July 22nd through July 29th. 

Love life is still quiet...i'm still around the same girls i was around last year although there are a few new ones, i'd love to get to know. Things are quiet mostly with it though.

So my life at the moment...

I'm still finishing fighting off MRSA (nasty strain of staph infection) in my left leg. i've been dealing with this for at least 3 weeks now. It's almost done but i've gotta change the bandage everyday and use my ointment on it. 

I moved away from Bear and to the Northside of Wilmington. I'm not sure if i'm technically in the city or not but i'm living in an apartment with Kristyn and Fran still off of Lea Boulevard. 
The strain of our extra houseguests are off and things have been better. 

I'm still at Hot Topic, still working hard and we're rockin out down there with an old school crew and just trying to have a good time and make the money :)  We're getting a new store soon. It's gonna be a lot of fun. 

Love life is quiet. I don't have a major crush or anything at the current moment. I'm just taking each day as it comes. 

Major Hobby is still World of Warcraft. I do it when I have nothing better to do.  If I get a chance to hang out with my friends i'd rather do that. 

I should be getting a car within a month and that will definitely open up some mobility for me. There are some friends I will probably see more when I drive. :) 

Life's fine and i don't know when i'll update again. I still read my friends list probably once a week.  I'm mostly on Myspace everyday though so check that out if you get curious and hope life is good for everyone. 

Much Love,

"event","I'm still alive, still neglecting the live journal in favor of myspace. It's been about 4-5 months since I've done anything with it. In that time i've had a few months of female drama with a new girlfriend, an ex-girlfriend/friend, and another potential girlfriend. 

The drama is pretty much over.  I'm single and had my first date with someone new. We hit it off pretty good. We just have to schedule our second date now. The other girls are all friendly with me. The one girl I dated briefly is dating Brian now.  The ex and I are friends, she seems happy with her boyfriend finally.  The other girl is still friends as well. She's got a bunch of confusion for her with her boyfriend, another guy and me while i've kind of turned the switch over to friend with her. I just want them all to be happy.  

Work is going mostly well, everyone has a bad day here and there. I actually have to leave for work in about 25 minutes. I'm doing a close shift tonight. It's the holidays, lots to do, lots of people to help and not enough time to do it in. 

Most of my freetime lately is spent either playing World of Warcraft, hanging out with friends or reading. I'm on myspace constantly and i do check LJ every so often. 

Hope everyone's doing well and hope everyone has great holidays.  

Much love.

"event","A weekend off. Life is pretty good right now. i'm running myself a little ragged but i knew that tomorrow can be catch up day. I've slept 4-5 hours for the past three days..i'm gonna crash hard tonight.

Today was spent at Wizard World Philly with Curt, Nick and Lori. I ended up running around, bought some comics, got a nifty new superhero t-shirt. I ended up meeting and getting Claudio Sanchez to autograph a copy of the new Coheed comic ""The Amory Wars"" for me. I just wish i had brought someone with me so i could have gotten a picture on my phone. I also got a couple of issues of Daredevil autographed by both Brian Michael Bendis (The Wizard World Guest of Honor and Daredevil writer) and Alex Maleev (Daredevil artist). I got a little birthday present for Kristyn, there wasn't as much cool Lost stuff up there as I thought there would be. Lots of neat comic stuff though, I bought a good bit of Daredevil stuff, Witchblade, The Darkness and I got a few con exclusives too.

I just roamed around a bit and I managed to run into Rosie Posie, Blake and Morgan, and Miken among the throngs at the con. It was a good time, i ran around on my own a good bit but it's all gravy. I also picked up ""The Umbrella Academy"" comic book which was partially done by Gerard Way of MCR. After the con, we drove downstate to the new Sonic! Mmmm...sonic. I had to get my tots and I was a nice person and brought some home for Fran and Kristyn.

Kristyn's birthday party was last night, i ended up hiding more then i really wanted to do. We got watching lots of random youtube videos and it just ate up time but i still had fun with curt, brian and scott. There was lots of company and everyone seemed to have a good time.

I did get to hang out with Brian one night this week for the first time in a while. It was good to chill together, we hung out, got some food, watched ""A Night At The Museum"" at his house before we came over here and talked about lots of things which would be very wrong LoL. It was a good time. I didn't go to bed till 6 that morning.

Hung out with Jenny as well this week. I got to check out the Wii for the first time and it was pretty cool. I was playing Wii Sports and i did okay..especially for my first time. We talked a little bit as well and things are fine. We're still good friends.

I've also been exchanging messages with someone new this week. Someone who found me through a friend but we seem to click pretty well, at least so far. :) I've been enjoying myself and i love getting to know new people. I haven't been this way about someone in a little while. I need to write her a message after i'm done this blog.

Been randomly myspace messaging a few other friends as well this week. It's been a pretty good one. Work is work...get a couple people returning shortly to make up for those we've lost and i'm sure things will be fun. I get to deal with a new DM this week.
It should be a little calmer this week....bookending off days...sunday and saturday. Possibly going to Great Adventure next Saturday morning.

Much love to everyone, i'm gonna send out a message or two, check on my WoW and do my best to stay awake and hope i get to talk to someone tonight. *blush*"

"event","2:40am..finds me sitting here listening to music and just pondering a little bit. My LJ is not as read as my myspace so i'm gonna put some stuff on here i probably would never put on there. 

Listening to the new Fall Out Boy song ""Thanks for the Mmrs""..just cause it's resonating around my head at the moment.  

People's perceptions of me rolling around in my head...as much as i say i don't care, there are some people i care about and their perceptions of me and things in my head are just in a consistent state of emotional turmoil. 

A lot of it has been because of my relationship status. I broke up with Jenny on Easter. i'd been with her on and off for a little over a year and i haven't ever had a relationship that long and that adult before.  I was a late bloomer, i didn't have anyone until i was 19-20..and then it was online dating mostly. 

I really do love her and care about her but it seems like we fought a lot. I'm not serious enough for her and some of my personality quirks drove her crazy with me as her boyfriend. She's 
 fine with me as a friend with my aspects. She pushed my buttons a lot..and liked to pick at me until i was angry and started firing back.  I worried about not having enough in common.  It seems like the easiest stuff for us to talk about is work. I want to immerse myself in her world, her hobbies..and i have to an extent but it still doesn't flow as easily as some other stuff. 

I'm still having issues getting over it...which is kinda sad considering i'm the one who initiated the breakup. 

i'm doing a little bit of flirting here and there with a few people I knew from before. 
apparently i'm coming on too strongly...i have someone telling me that i'm sexually frustrated.
I have my best friend thinking that i'm going to take my other friend who came over into the bedroom and it's not really the case. 

I talk a lot...I flirt a lot..but if i'm not clear on the fact that you really like me, i'm not gonna do a thing.  I'm shy, i'm a little bit fearful of rejection and i usually don't go over people i don't know at least a little bit..so i don't want to fuck up a friendship.  

i guess i'm just a little bothered by it at the moment. i'm not trying to be emotional and a pain in the ass but everyone has these thoughts and just has to get em out somehow.

I'm trying to keep optimistic about life and everything but sometimes one sad comment can break me down.  

I think it's human to want somebody to like me best. I don't think it's too bad. I just need to get over it and get on with life.  

I'm going to a show tomorrow in philly with james and it should be a good time. i'll have a few drinks, have some fun and listen to some ICP and Twiztid with some fun people. 

Not sure who's gonna read but i'm always appreciative of advice and feedback."

Really good week for the most part. Went to Nocturne with a few people, saw maybe a half dozen more that I actually knew there.  Drunk sex is fun O:-)  Work has been a little stressful, so much to do and we need more hours.  

Before the club, I went and put a sweet trenchcoat on layaway at Passional on Wednesday night. It's sleeveless, leather and goes from collar to floor. It's $400 which is by far the most i've ever spent on any piece of clothing. it's also a 6X which is massive but it gives me room to close it among other things.

I know i still haven't been to the delawhere reading yet. i'm supposed to close the next 2 wednesdays but i'm hoping to bail out of one of them and get there finally. i've been a bad poetry supporter lately. 

I've started playing World of Warcraft..aKa Warcrack.  I haven't spent any time on it this week. It's been busy with work, hanging out and sleeping a fair bit. was gonna play today but i slept in and have been doing other things. 

I'm enjoying my Friday off tremendously and i'm off again on sunday.

looking forward to the summer, lots of shows, fun summer events and a few birthdays as well. :) 

hope everyone is well, gonna go do something else.  

peace love and grayy."

"event","Sitting here listening to the new song on my profile when I should be sleeping. I'm getting up in 4.5 hours to spend all of my 2nd day off this week from the day job..working and doing wrestling stuff because it's something i love and it's something that's been in my blood since I was five years old. I've gotten slammed around about it a good bit, i've been asked when am i gonna grow up and stop it but it's something i love and it's something i've been interested in for a while. i don't buy into it as heavily as some of my other friends but I know whether or not we're making money from it, it's still something i'm going to do out of my love for it. It may not be the greatest thing in the world but it's a group of people going out there and putting their hearts, their bodies and their souls on the line for something they believe in. I've gone to Kentucky twice, spent a good bit of money in doing so although it's not as much as some others..it's what i do, it's what i love and if it's not in your blood, it's not something you'll understand. Take a minute, check it out, laugh at it if you want, ooh and ahh it if you want to, because behind it all is the passion and the love of at least 6 people I know. http://www.xmwrestling.com

My emotions are up, i'm going to use it as fuel for tomorrow, expend some of that anger and frustration with certain other things and use it to my best advantage.

My heart still loves her and wants to be with her but my head knows it's not the healthiest thing in the world but still wonders whether there is something better out there. I hear other people talk and sometimes it makes the arguments and the problems seem trivial. I talk and flirt with a few other people. I'm curious to get to know new people and learn more about those i don't know to see if there's something i'm missing out there. I was putting a bathing suit bottom back on a hanger at work and i said hi to people coming in like i do...a girl came back with a flirtatious response involving what i was putting on the hanger...and i got a little flustered, i'm like, mallrats...too young...you're 26 and you can't flirt with anyone under 18..except for maybe Kim (cause that's innocent flirtation O:-) ).

part of me is just like, it's good to get out there and talk to new people, finding someone new to love is the best way to get over someone else. All the people from my past still have a fond place within my heart...no matter what's happened with it. I remember how I felt and some of the experiences and it's all a part of what makes me who I am.

it's all about passion. i may not be doing breathtaking things every second of my life but I'm passionate about loving my life, making every moment count to the fullest and not worrying about the what if's. Be happy with who you are and if you're not happy with it, do something about it.

I'm passionate about my friends, i'm passionate about my happiness, i'm passionate about professional wrestling, i'm passionate about music and i'm passionate about living the best life I possibly can and i'm also passionate about trying to make the lives of others around me BETTER."

Friday morning...another 3 day work weekend is coming up for me but i'm rewarded with a Monday off. I've been somewhat of a stress ball all week and letting stuff get to me that really shouldn't be bothering me.

I have a few things on my mind at the moment but it's clearing up and i'm getting a little more decisive then i've been...been kind of helpless.

Went to Nocturne on Wednesday night with Jenny...saw a couple of the mall regs up there (parson walked right by me...ha! LoL)...and then Jess, Meg and Meg's b/f Chris showed up after I had had 4 drinks (Peach Long Island Ice Teas are the shiznit). Melissa's friend Megan was there too and she was pretty cool. It was a pretty good time, i might have made a slight ass out of myself..don't know, it's not that important.

Wednesday i did end up buying some stuff from work. I got the Foster's season 1 DVD and Neurotically Yours Vol. 3 on DVD as well. I got a Bloo pin for my name tag at work and i got a Bloo and Cheese sticker that is the epitome of me and Jenny's relationship.

I've made a phone call or two this week and i've got a few more I have to make still (Sorry Jen...i still love you...schedules have just sucked...i'll try and call tonight).

Work schedule for the weekend is today (Fri) 12-8:30pm, Saturday 9-5:30pm and Sunday 10am-6:30pm.

Sunday night is Wrestlemania and i'm geeking a little bit. It should be fun, final details still to be set...and i gotta decide where to get pizza/food from...

i'm obsessed with my Vincent Black Shadow song right now and I need to pick up a VNV Nation ticket for the 13th since i should be going....:)

20 minutes left and i might do a blog/cross post on LJ too.

Come visit me if you'd like...

"event","Okay, thanks to a little nudging from the Wookie Monster and also from the new circumstances i'm in, here i'm once again posting to LJ for the first time in 17 weeks.  

My life has just gone through a major change or two. It's been a very busy and somewhat crazy 4 months since I last posted. 

I have now moved into an apartment with Kristyn and Fran in the Village of Windhover behind Governor's Square. If you want more details, you'll have to comment and send an e-mail addy and i can send you the address that way, who knows what crazyness lurks on the internet?  We just moved in on Friday.  

I'll have my own computer again, I'm being given/buying cheaply their old computer and we've gotten the Comcast deal with cable, internet and phone. I have a few people who want me to join them on the magical wonderful online World of Warcraft game and we'll see if it happens. Right now, however, my computer's not even hooked up. I need a new computer desk because the one my old roommate gave me broke in the moving process (it was already cracked).  Right now i'm using Kris and Fran's comp. I need to get a wireless adapter too. 

In about 3 hours, i return to Christiana Mall full time after spending a year in Concord Mall. I enjoyed everything there. I'm gonna miss co-workers and some customers but i am glad to come back to some of the people i missed at Christiana as well. It's also the next step on the road to proving that I deserve my own Hot Topic to run. :) 

Jenny and I are officially a couple again and have been since the week before Christmas. We've had a bump or two in the road but everything is good right now and we've done some cool things together (GWAR and Dir En Grey shows to name a few). 

I've been to the goth club a little bit, a few concerts (see above, Wednesday 13 among others), an ROH show or two.  

XMW is planning its first big show on March 24th entitled ""Deception""

It's just been a crazy whirlwind called life.  :) 

Of course, i'm still myspace addicted although i haven't been on it quite as much in 2007.

I stole that from melissa. :) Saw it on a few other people's pages. 
I posted stuff on Myspace tonight and i'm tired and sore and just don't feel like typing it all out again.

"event","So my often neglected livejournal sits here staring at me...saying...USE ME...USE ME...Do something with this empty void of space that is sitting here on the internet.  So...Hi again everybody :) 

Here's what's been going on in my life lately. 

WORK/CAREER STUFF: As of this Sunday, i'm now a Full Time Assistant Manager at Hot Topic Concord. :) I'm very happy and very excited. I've been with the company for five years now and i didn't get promoted at all until last christmas so it's been a very good year. 3 promotions within 10 months. WOO-HAH!!  I'm also going to be helping out on Wednesdays and Fridays at Christiana in the month of November because of some medical issues going on there.  The other thing that some people may not call work but I take it about as seriously as my main job is XMW which is short for Xtreme Mayhem Wrestling. I went to Kentucky two weekends ago with Curt who is co-owner of our fed and we picked up our wrestling ring from Lawrenceburg.  We have our first real show coming up on October 22nd even if it's only for kids who have been down with us since Day 1.  Anyway, check out the website. http://www.xmwrestling.com  and if you click the link for Hazmat TV, you can watch us up on YouTube.    

PERSONAL/LOVE LIFE:  Nothing much big going on here.  I'm not officially dating Jenny but we're still good friends, we cuddle and i'm always going to love her somewhere in my heart. I'm not really worried about dating anyone at the moment. I have a few thoughts and notions in my head but i'm happy with the way things are right now.  There is so much else going on right now, i don't know if i can be a good boyfriend for someone right now.  

HOBBIES:  i've been doing my comic book thing full force lately. :) I have a subscription box at  The Comic Book Shop (http://www.thecomicbookshop.com) and i've been doing that a bunch. I keep seeing people from Days of Knights at work and telling em that I haven't done Yu-Gi-Oh since February. I've been reading a lot.  Last book finished was ""Phantom"" by Terry Goodkind. I'm currently reading the Ron White comedy book. :) 

EVENTS:  Lots of stuff coming up.  XMW Hockessin Havok is October 22nd, ICP Hallowicked 2006 is October 25th at the Electric Factory.  Dracula's Ball is Halloween night and Jenny's 21st is also November 1st..so probably Nocturne as well.  Ring of Honor show in Philly is November 4th and I should be at that as well. 

I'm off tomorrow from work probably just gonna do some laundry and watch a few DVDs, read and relax.  I'm working Saturday from 1:30-10pm at Concord, working with XMW on Sunday and then i'm off again on Monday. 

Fantasy football is also rocking this year.  i'm 5-0 and leading the League of Pain 2K7.  It's AWESOME. 

I hope everyone's doing well and hopefully i'll be better about updating this (i doubt it)
You can follow me on Myspace too.  :) 

Much love.

"event","nother week and life goes on. There's a lot swirling around in my head, about the present, about the future and the past never goes away either.

Tomorrow night i'm gonna end up hanging out with one of my longest friends for the first time in probably months..definitely months since it's just been me and him, one on one. We've been friends for 15 years now. There's a lot of good times and bad times and there's that time shared which makes me want to help him in any time of need. I have lost a lot of respect for him in the past few years. Interests have changed for both of us and we've seperated but the question is how bad have things gotten and can they be fixed? The truth shall set you free..i can worry about it and dredd it a little bit but we'll find out. We've been friends for too long for me to give up on him. I'm not the only one who wants to help him get out of the rut that his life has become..i hope i find his head in okay places...if not, we're gonna find ways to get them in better places.

The future is full of limitless possibilities right now. Keeping faith that XMW is moving in the right direction. It's not my dream as much as some of my friends but then again I don't really have any dreams of my own. I'm hoping that everything works out as we plan and some dreams do come true. I'm enjoying things, i'm itching to get out there and i'm going on. Also..a change of living plans continues to come up...2007. I may end up moving out of my current digs and in an apartment with some friends. It'd be a nice change of pace for me. I have one roommate who's really awesome and he's been around longer then I have but then i have this other one who is a complete ass and wants to cuss me and let the small things get to him. I'm looking forward to getting away from him. Work has gone well over the past year...2 promotions over the past year...maybe a 3rd before the year is out. My hope for the future is a strong thing.


I'm pretty happy with my present at the moment. I have some great friends that I see on a regular basis. I have other great friends that i don't get to talk to nearly as much as I'd like. I love my job. I'm comfortable where i'm living and I have some fun short term plans. The only complaint is there isn't enough time for everything I want to do and everyone I want to see and talk to throughout my life.

Thank you to everyone for helping to make my life as pleasant as it is at the moment."

"event","Tuesday night, i'm just at the library, taking a few hours to relax, have some computer time and catch up on LJ, MySpace and my wrestling endeavors. 

Sunday, We ran a house show and I took things to new limits for me. I don't normally do as much crazy stuff as I did that day but I was wrestling Loco B. Ware and I felt like I had to rise to the occasion..plus he was like ""beat the crap out of me.""  I probably have 20 or 25 minor cuts on my arms, stomach and back from landing on barbed wire and wrapping it around me for a few moves.  it doesn't look pretty but it's not nearly as bad as you would think.  We had a few new people show up and work out. We loved the enthusiasm and the work ethic. :) I'm not gonna mention names or anything but one of them is an LJer. :)  The future for our wrestling is looking brighter, we keep adding people to the mix and we're also getting a real wrestling ring next weekend. We're taking next Sunday off..but we're returning to wrestle on August 27th..if you want to know more about it..go visit our website. http://xmwrestling.com

Curt and I (taking some advice from Morgan) called Brian out about lying to us with regards to wrestling. I've been friends with Brian for 15 years now and even though the ties that bind aren't as close as they used to be, he's still my friend, i'll always help him out when he's in need and if he wants to talk to me, all he has to do is call. We were pissed because he lied to us a few times about wrestling. He made up excuses and didn't actually do what he told us. He's a little scared at the moment and we would have been completely cool if he would have come to us and said ""I want to take some time off to think about this because.."" but he didn't...he made up bullshit excuses and Curt and I called him on it. Hopefully the problem is fixed and if he doesn't want to do it anymore...all he has to do is tell us that he quits. 

It was an okay weekend otherwise...went and saw POTC: Dead Man's Chest with Jenny on Saturday night and really enjoyed the movie and its plot twists. The next one should be fun to watch as well.  Few minor headaches as well that day but hopefully it's all over. 

Thursday is six months for me and Jenny and I have a few worries about our relationship but i'm also mostly happy with it as well. Someone asked me if I could see it being a long term thing, I told my friend that if we make it through the first year, it should get easier. It really depends on what she wants to do with her future because for now i'm taking my life one day, one week at a time and just living for the moment.  ""I love her madly"" to steal a Doors quote. 
  
I read Kushiel's Scion..really good book...i'm eagerly awaiting the next one..it's gonna take too long dammit...

At the moment i'm reading an awesome music book called ""Life On Planet Rock"" by Lonn Friend.  Next on the list is a book Kristyn gave me to read, ""Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs"" by Chuck Klostermann.

I'm also going to see Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers with Kristyn on Friday night.  Julie may end up coming but I don't know yet. Christina aKa Shroomy is gonna be there as well and i'm gonna try and find her at some point. 


Life's so busy at times...i really wouldn't mind a few days to get away..but it's gonna be at least a month before I can do that again. 

Working tomorrow morning 9-5:30pm before i'm off Thurs and Friday. i'm working 1:30-10pm on Saturday and i'm off on Sunday.  Summerslam is Sunday and it's looking like fun as well. 

Hope everyone is doing well, much love and as always feel free to comment.

i'm still plugging it and it's still under construction. :) I did talk to a few people about participating and i'm hoping to continue my recruiting stuff. :) 

Going grocery shopping after i'm done with the computer and then home to watch RAW and chill.  Jenny's working..haven't had a lot of time with her because of work schedules and us doing things seperately.  It continues with her going to Otakon this weekend and me going to Ozzfest on Friday. 

Hope all is well, running short on time...i've been thinking and I know I have a few really interesting blogs in my head..i just don't have any time to express it at the moment..

"event","Okay so it seems like today is going to be a melancholy day.  I think i'm starting to get sick. My throat is bothering me and it hurts to talk with normal volume.  I'm talking very quietly if at all at the moment.  

I'm heading into work soon.  I'm closing tonight at HT Concord from 1:30-10pm. It's either Wally or Lindsay with me. 

Was texting back and forth with Jen last night. She's been avoiding me lately because she knew if she talked with me, she'd break down and lose it.  She's very unhappy in her situation at the moment and she broke last night and started texting me.  We went back and forth for like an hour or so.  Hopefully i can get a chance to go visit her in august..i'm not sure though...so much is going on. 

Think Jenny's irritated at me at the moment for being apathetic and emo towards a few things and i'm just kind of in a curl up and make the world go away mood at the moment.

I need a hug. 

Thinking about things a good bit lately and i'm sad that my friends seem to be disappearing. There are always new people I'm talking with but a lot of the old ones have just faded away. 

At the moment I just want to fade away. The world would still go on as always and my pain would just have faded as well."

"event","Tuesday is here and i've been off since Friday.  Overall it was a decent birthday weekend.  I didn't do a lot on Friday..just hung out with Jenny, played lots of Final Fantasy X and had a pretty good day. 

Saturday was my birthday celebration in Philly.  I was very glad to see everyone who came out. It was me, Jenny, Curt, Nick, Lori at the start and then around 8pm Scott, Ariel, Kristyn, Fran, Megan, Morgan and Ray showed up and finally not too long after that Jess V. & Geoff showed up and a good time was had by all. I beat trivia 5 or 6 times. I got Jenny a Hello Kitty plushie and Hello Kitty plush backpack. I got a Cookie Monster plush, a D&B's sport canister and a spinner bling necklace for myself.  The original 5 ended up at Tony Luke's on Oregon Avenue for a real Philly Cheesesteak at the end of the night. 

Sunday was wrestling.  We did that from about 10am-7pm.  If anyone is down in the bear area. We're at the intersection of Songsmith Rd. & Stone Place every Sunday around 12 or 1pm. We have a lot of fun and beat the crap out of each other...XMW style. 

Yesterday was okay. I sat around and read ""Danse Macabre"" by Laurell K. Hamilton which was autographed for me as a birthday present last week. I talked to Jenny on the phone a little bit and I ended up hanging out with Kristyn all night. By the end of the night, I had an upset girlfriend who wouldn't tell me why.  I told her i'd come over tonight if she wanted me to but we'll see what she wants. 

I did get lots of phone calls over the weekend too. I got a grandpa from a 303 area code..with some weird ass prank calls. Bill from Staten Island called and wished me a Happy Birthday. I got a really surprising phone call from Shayna who I've never gotten a call from before (I have to call her back still though..doh!).  I also got a text from Christina aKa Shroomy last night which made me happy cause we haven't talked in months and I was wondering about her.  I feel very loved by my friends...:) 

Now I get to go back to work..which is gonna suck after this many days off...and because they don't love me up there like they did at my old store and at Borders. 

I have more on my mind but I don't have more time at the moment. 

Much love to everyone reading...

Eternally....

If you've like to see more of what i've been doing lately...go check out my MySpace account.

At the moment i'm sitting in Wilmington Library just getting my comp time in now before work. i'm gonna leave here around 1ish...to be at Concord Mall from 1:30-10pm. I've been closing in bunches this week. I'm doing it Monday through Thursday this week. 

Friday is my 26th birthday.  I don't have any plans really for Friday.  I went ahead and planned for people to come to Dave & Buster's with me on Saturday.  I'm sure i'll do a little something on Friday.  I'm not sure what..maybe just dinner..who knows but the main event is Saturday. 

I'm mostly spending my freetime hanging out with my usual trio of terror.  My girlfriend Jenny, and my good friends Kristyn and Curt.  

We're getting our wrestling group, XMW, in order and we're recruiting new talent.  We look for people to commit Sundays from 12-6pm every week (almost anyway) and we're very willing to train and teach people. 

I've also gotten back into comic books again.  I'm reading lots of Marvel stuff. The two big titles are ones that I used to read the first time i was doing comics and those are Daredevil and X-Factor.  I'm also getting into New X-Men: Academy X and i'm trying to follow the big story arc in Marvel right now and that's Civil War.   The New Avengers is also another damn cool title. 

I'm gonna see what I can do about updating this thing more often.  I have a lot of stuff on my mind at the moment but i'm not quite ready to share it with the world..so keep your eyes open and maybe you'll find out real soon.

Starting to reassess some opinions on people I worked with for a while and how they acted because they had to act that way.  I don't know, i'm just kind of pissed off and I don't want to talk about it here..it's too public.  Needless to say I like going into my old store at night much better then during the day and i'm going to be all business towards it unless i'm specifically talking to certain people. 

I've still basically been living with the girlfriend at this point. Everything is going well but I still feel really bad that I talk to most of my friends on a very reduced basis.  I have to do a better job of balancing the time.  I just feel more complete when i'm around her.  The balance, the balance...

Went to poetry last tuesday and had a good time. Rachel McKibbens was awesome and I read my new haikus. I still have to write more. Birthday Massacre Show was fun.
Great show, had a fun time.  The wedding was nice. 

I plan on going to Philly on Saturday for Ring of Honor with Curt and i'm not sure who else...i'm invited to someone's birthday party on Saturday as well and I feel bad that I already have plans. i'm gonna have to try to get up there however..even if it's a little late. 

So much negativity right now...and I just don't want to bring the bad karma on myself...

I've been mostly working around 40 hours a week at Hot Topic Concord Mall, spending a lot of time with my girlfriend, eating out way too much and trying to budget my money. 

I've been to poetry one time in the last month but I do tremendously enjoy it. I went and watched <lj user=""dramamonkey81"">'s feature.  He did a good job..just a little rushed at moments and he still has to inscribe my chapbook. 

I've also been to one Yugioh event as well although we did two tournaments and I was there for about 10 hours.  I miss it as well. I just don't have all the time in the world that I want.  I have too many hobbies for my own good sometimes. 

Lots of stuff coming up in the Larry calendar...

Wrestlemania XXII is Sunday, April 2nd
Nick and Lori's Wedding is Saturday April 8th (i'm a groomsman)
The Birthday Massacre concert @ The Trocadero is April 9th (i'm going, most of christiana's hot topic is going and a few other cool kids)

I'd really like to go to Warped Tour and Ozzfest but they're two days in a row @ Tweeter in Philly.
I haven't checked the Warped lineup but so far i'm hearing AFI, Joan Jett and Gym Class Heroes. I'll have to check out the website. 

Ozzfest is System of a Down, Ozzy, Disturbed and Lacuna Coil along with a bunch of metalcore stuff.  I'm also hoping to get backstage through either work or an ex-coworker who rocks my socks. 

XMW is also in process...i'm recruiting for people who are interested in wrestling. 

I'm also now officially part of two bands with Curt.  One is underground rap/juggalo rap called Suspect Xero and the other is going to be a crazy ass cover band called Space Monkey Mafia.

I'm going to try and do better with LJ in the future, i've been on here for 3 years now if i'm not mistaken...what a wild and crazy ride. 

If you want to come stalk me at work..feel free....

This week's schedule...

Today (4/1) 1:30-10pm
Monday (4/3) 1:30-10pm
Tuesday (4/4) 1:30-10pm
Wednesday (4/5) 9am-5:30pm

Thursday night was my last night at Borders. I put in my two weeks notice on the 10th and finished my obligation Thursday night. I am sad to be leaving all the cool people at Borders but i'm not sad to be leaving two jobs behind.  I hope I can stay in touch with everyone and I will be back to visit.

Well, as of the 27th...I am now an assistant manager at the Hot Topic in Concord Mall.  :)  I'm transferring up there and looking forward to a new opportunity with cool people and more responsibility. So everyone has to come up there and visit me from now on..my schedule this week is 1:30-10pm on Monday and Thursday and 9-5:30pm on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

I plan on returning to poetry this week and also returning to Nocturne as well.  :) Back to my old haunts...woot woot.

"event","So at the current moment i'm sitting in Jen and Joe's trailer in Magnolia, DE...just been computer addicted since i've got the chance. 

The work crunch has its moments and gets to me. I've been almost completely ignoring LJ and sometimes I wonder about deleting it. Computer time is about 2 hours a week if that so all I usually do is check e-mail and myspace and maybe a wrestling website or two. 

it's nice to get away though. I got here at about 3pm yesterday and will be here until probably 12 or 1pm on Monday...then back to the grind.

This is my work schedule and probably what i've been doing for the past month...

Sun: Off
Mon: Off (Normally I do 8 hours @ Borders)
Tues: 8am-4pm @ Borders and 5-10pm @ HT
Wed: 8am-4pm @ Borders and 5-10pm @ HT
Thur: 9-4:30pm @ HT and 6-11:30pm @ Borders
Fri: 10am-5:30pm @ HT (lately i've been off)
Sat: 10am-5:30pm @ HT and 7pm-midnight @ Borders

i've been hanging around on Monday nights, Thursday nights after Borders, and on Sundays...so I get a little bit of playtime.

I just hate that I barely get to see my friends anymore. 
I debate about dropping back to part time at Borders and instead of doing 32-35 hours a week there, go do like 15-20 in addition to the 20 i usually get at HT (i'm doing 30 this week)

it's good to get away though.  I watched American Pie presents Band Camp, Sin City and The Devil's Rejects last night..today is looking like the Punisher and maybe some other stuff. 

Hope all is well for everyone and i'll probably update again in a few weeks...

I'm going to go get groceries soon and then do some laundry as well. So much to do, so little time. 

Take care every one and i'll hopefully say more sooner then this time.

"event","More then 2 weeks later.  I'm just vegging at Kristyn's. She's playing Animal Crossing for the DS.  Fran and Ray are here playing Smackdown vs RAW 2  and i'm just being an internet addict. 

Getting a little burned out from the job thing. Yesterday at the mall was absolute hell.  I'm going to be there again Thursday for some more training and the Hot Topic balance of power returns...26 hours there next week and probably like 20-25 at Borders. 

If I'm not scheduled at Borders, I plan on getting my Stitch tattoo on Monday. Brian's coming with me..i'm not sure about who else...and where i'm going. 

I'm sorry I haven't been writing and following people lately...it's been too busy and I haven't been on a computer at all.  I still keep a lot of people in my head and I hope everyone had a great and happy Holiday.

Looking forward to New Year's Eve.  I'm closing at Borders. I'll be there till 7. 
Then we'll figure out plans from there....

i'm hoping for Sunday and Monday off (since buses don't run on Monday)

The iWPS qualifier slam was great and it was good to get back to some old haunts..like poetry and yugi.  

2006 is upon the horizon and i'm looking forward to the new year.  
A new position at work, a new start to things and change will do me good. 

Smackdown is also going to be on 1/10...woot woot."

"event","Entry Number 550 Damn...it's been a while. I haven't posted on here since Thanksgiving. I've been much more of a MySpace addict then an LJ addict lately.  If you want to check blogs from the past few weeks..it'd have to be there.  http://www.myspace.com/users/sexualtapioca 

Many of you are on there, many of you aren't.  

Work's been dominating my life and it grabs a stranglehold on me from now till January i'm sure. 

If you can't find me at Hot Topic or Borders...then chances are..you're not going to be able to find me. 

This week...

Monday (today) worked 9-5pm @ Borders.  (It was busy as fuck by the way)
Tuesday: 7am-3pm @ Borders. Maybe a few hours at Hot Topic. 
Wednesday: 7:30am-3:30pm @ Borders and 4pm-10pm @ Hot Topic. 
Thursday: 12-8:30pm @ Hot Topic
Friday: 8am-4pm @ Borders and 5pm-12:30am @ Hot Topic
Saturday: 11am-7pm @ Borders

60 hour work week...damn. 

I went to see Disturbed last night at the House of Blues in Atlantic City with <lj user=""dayzeehasissues"">. It was my first time meeting her, first time in AC and first time at the House of Blues.  Disturbed was phenomenal as always.  I ended up meeting the band because of Stephanie and her friends.  I got my ticket stub autographed and shook everyone's hand.  Corrosion of Conformity and Dry Kill Logic opened the show. I was more into Dry Kill then COC.  It was a good time. I was screaming and singing along...favorite song they did was probably ""Voices""

Draiman went on a rant about downloading the CD and how the RIAA is making the first mistake of business...pissing off the customers. It's good to see that he's cool with getting his $35 from the show tickets.  Woosah!!

Changes also coming at work..hopefully all for the better but i'm not saying more until it's finalized. 

Hope everyone is doing well and having a safe and fun holiday season. 

I'm gonna go get peeved at how slow MySpace is being again before I go home and watch RAW. 

Peace, Love and Gravy...

Larry."

I had food and I ended up buying a loaf of their freshly made wheat bread and a jar of apple butter to take with me. I'm sitting at Kristyn's house right now being a little less full then earlier and just killing time..before we stop by my mom's for a bit.  

The last post before this is my last poem that I wrote. Two new LJ icons.  One is Boondocks and the current one is Drawn Together. 

Schedule for the weekend so far...

Friday: 1:30-10pm @ Hot Topic
Saturday: 9am-5pm @ Borders 
Sunday: 8pm-11pm Survivor Series @ Curt's House. 

Things are generally good. A little too much work perhaps? Just wishing I had more time for my friends and maybe a perspective sweetheart but life goes on. 

Hope everyone's having a great day."

I hope that everyone has someone or somebody to be thankful for this year. I'm thankful for all of my great friends on and offline that make me feel appreciated and loved on a pretty regular basis. 

I'm spending Thanksgiving going to an early dinner in Lancaster with a few of my friends and then probably making a trip to my mother's afterwards. I'm not sure what's going on tomorrow evening but if you'd like to try and find me.  I'm sure i shouldn't be too hard to find. 

I'm working today @ Borders from 11am-7pm and maybe Hot Topic afterwards. I'm spending the night at a friend's house to make it easier for us to leave tomorrow.  It's gonna be a good day. 

The 27th makes it 14 months since I cut my hair and i'm trying to decide if I want to cut it or what I want to do.  I cut off my sideburns on Monday.  My hair's not in my face or annoying me very often but i'm just feeling in the mood for a change.  What do y'all think??

I'll be around eventfully i'm sure but I hope everyone has a great holiday and holiday weekend. 

Remember that I love you all. <3333

"event","Another one of these quick...time is running out entries that i'm so good at lately.

1. It's fucking cold out there right now.  It's not really that bad but it's the fact that it was about 70 degrees three days ago that it makes it drastic.   My fingers were freezing and going numb when I was on AIM on my phone last night. 

2. I visited my mom's house today and everything went fine.  She took in 2 pairs of pants for me but I haven't tried them out yet.  I also got a few more holes punched in my belt and that seems to be helping a whole lot. 

3. I'm doing Hot Topic tonight from 6-11pm..maybe earlier if there's a crapload of shipment. As usual, i'm still deciding how i'm getting home and i'm also doing Borders tomorrow from 11am-7pm. 

4. Schedule for next week:  Sunday 9pm-10pm, Monday 11-7pm, Tuesday 8-4pm, Wednesday 11-7pm and Saturday 9am-5pm @ Borders.  Sunday 7:30-9pm, (Black) Friday 1:30-10pm @ Hot Topic.  Holiday Shopping season is upon us and let them unleash the dogs of hell...

5.  Yesterday was my daily emo day for the month. It should pass until next month. 

6.  There is no point 6...HA

7. Going to Borders to hang out with Kristyn for a bit before HT. I'm also currently reading ""Mary, Mary"" the new James Patterson novel...yay!!!

8.  Peace, Love and Gravy...i'll probably be online sometime tomorrow."

"event","I ended up pulling a double yesterday.  I did Borders from 10-6pm and 6:30-10pm @ Hot Topic.  I ended up buying the new ICP CD yesterday but haven't gotten a chance to listen to it. 

I ended up hanging out with Jenny last night after work.  We went to the diner and saw Elise, Alyson, Jessica, Daynuh and some of the other usual diner crowd.   I'm always a regular at some kind of diner it seems. 

I ended up having a good conversation with Jenny and just being able to voice some of the stuff in my head.  I learned a few things as well.  I like being open and honest with people and I think that I'm not really as open about things as I perceive myself to be. 

I'm thinking more and noticing some paranoia in my behavior.   I tend to worry too much at times and not give a damn at others. It's a nice little mix of things, now isn't it?  

Just a lot of things going on in my head...

I'm working today at Borders from 11-7pm.  I'm not sure what's going on after work.  

I probably should go do something but right now I just kind of feel like hiding and cuddling up with Stitch.

I haven't forgotten about Livejournal, it just takes second priority at the moment.  My blogging tendencies on here tend to be much longer and much involved and with time being what it is right now, I don't get to read everyone's everything.  I'm sorry for that as well. I'm doing my best to keep up with all of my friends at the moment but it is harder sometimes more then others. 

I ended up buying Volume 20 of the Ranma 1/2 manga from Borders Express yesterday.  I bought the Gym Class Heroes and Coheed and Cambria (IV) CDs on Thursday so i've had a few new toys lately. 

I ended up watching TNA's ""Genesis"" PPV on Sunday and most of the RAW show last night before falling asleep and I was informed by Fran earlier that day about the sad fate of Eddy Guerrero. R.I.P Eddie/Eddy. I know all about the pain of losing someone you love and I was teary eyed last night watching RAW and seeing everyone mourning. 

Have to go home and do some laundry tonight.  Things haven't been too eventful, work, hanging out with my friends occasionally and being around mostly.  I bought some groceries as well and nothing too big planned. 

It's been nice to see people at the mall and at work and the Rocky turnout was great on Saturday night. I still felt bad about Katie and Ria not being able to get in :( 

Hope all is well with everyone and i'll get a chance to see or hear from you all soon.

"event","Okay, just clocked back in for my second hour of online time although i'm thinking of leaving before it's up just so I have more time to deal with work and maybe see what kind of cool things I can find at Borders before I have to actually start working today. 

So current events...short and sweet. 

-At the moment, it looks like i'm going to see Disturbed in Atlantic City on 12/11 with <lj user=""dayzeehasissues""> at the new House of Blues.  Yayyyyyyyyyyyyy! 

-Currently reading ""Blood of Angels"" by Michael Marshall. It's a great suspense horror book and even though it's a sequel, i'm not having any trouble picking it up either.  ""Positively Fifth Street"" by James McManus is next up on the reading list. 

-I'm falling into a morning pattern lately. I was supposed to stay up to hang out with <lj user=""starlightkitty3""> last night but I ended up falling asleep around 10:15 watching the new South Park.

-The Boondocks cartoon is awesome. I ended up watching it over Brian's house with him and Mori on Sunday night and just laughed my ass off. I love the comic strip and the cartoon is just hilarious.  The characters are great and Uncle Ruckus was just unbelieveably wrong but funny.  Did anyone else watch it?

-Next week i'm doing a morning pattern again at Borders..9-5, 8-4, 10-6...it bounces...days off are Sunday and Friday.  Friday night is Hot Topic.  I wonder if i'm staying on this pattern or what. 

-Thanksgiving dinner plans appear to be happening in Lancaster with Kris, Cassie and Joe (possibly) and maybe Fran.  

-Rocky Horror Picture Show THIS WEEKEND!!!  You need to come out and I'm hoping for the life of me that they have the big theatre this weekend. it's always so much better in the big theatre. 

-I'm off till 5pm tomorrow..plans are to go pay my cell phone bill and maybe get some lunch at Old Country Buffet...anyone wanna come? If you have the cell number...give me a call. 

-Working 12-8pm today.  Not sure if i'll get any online time tomorrow..but i'll be here till 10:45am today."

"event","Yesterday was a day for deep thoughts for me. 

I ended up realizing on Sunday that Christmas is only 7 weeks away.  I was trying to see what kind of extra money i'm going to have between working at Borders and Hot Topic and hopefully everything should be okay for Christmas with that. :) 

I started thinking about what I wanted for Christmas yesterday and I couldn't think of any material possessions right away.  I was thinking that what I wanted the most was to be able to see and spend some time with my friends and loved ones. 

Struggling and living on my own in 2005 has given me revelations about life and what's important.  My friends are the most important thing in the world to me. Without my closest friends, I would not have been able to survive through this episode of my life.  The support and generosity they show is just amazing and it just blows me away.  I love them with all of my heart and all of my soul and I will do as much as possible to repay them when I can. 

Some of my other friends have been fading in and out of my life and sometimes that makes me a little sad but I tend to notice a cycle with it. I may think they're disappearing but eventually someway, somehow they will return to my life in one form or another.  It's just the natural progression of life.  Life is change and your life is all about how you adapt to it.  :) 

The only things I think I managed to come up with for christmas wise would be just stuff I needed like new clothes, shoes and maybe a DVD or CD here and there

So yeah, end of deep thought stuff.  (maybe...)

I ended up working 10-6pm yesterday and ended up coming home but on the way home I talked to Jen downstate for a bit and filled her in on a few things...for which I then proceeded to get chided for my ""density"" where it comes to romance and romantic interest with women. LoL 

I was telling her about a few things that have been happening lately and she started yelling at me (not meanspirited LoL) and telling me that she was gonna come smack me because i'm just not doing obvious things and ignoring what should be some telltale signs....

I find it funny because I think my friends would agree that I get to know someone and I figure them out in a heartbeat but then when I get romantic feelings for someone or a crush.  I freeze up and turn completely stupid in situations where i'm involved with someone...at least I think I do.  

I just wonder if there's ever hope for me in that aspect...or am I just gonna have to wait till I find the person that knows to beat me over the head with saying ""I really like you and want to get involved with you.""

Headed to work soon and i'm gonna copy this over to myspace as well just so I can get more feedback on it all. 

I'll be on again tomorrow afternoon/evening if I don't end up at my mom's for a bit.

Have a great day everyone!"

"event","(Okay...note on this on the last journal entry...go back and read it before you read this one) 

Continuing from before....this was my weekend.  Friday and Saturday are part 1.  Sunday through Tuesday are gonna be part 2. 

Sunday was uneventful and I was going a little nuts out of boredom but I still got to sleep till almost 1pm. :)  I did football, I did a little bit of laundry and just chilled around the house.  The Eagles game was very depressing but then it got much better...then it just sucked again.  :)  I ended up falling asleep before the Boondocks TV show came on which made me sad. :(   (I like emoticons...DEAL WITH IT)

Monday I got up and did the early morning at Borders thing with Mori as well.  I met one of the other new trainees (Kip aKa Kristen) and worked 8-4.   After that, I ended up getting a Dracula's Ball ticket for me and for Jenny since Tuesday was her birthday.  We had met up with Fran, Kristyn and Joe at the mall and minor drama ensued.  (Some of my friends are just way too sensitive for their own damn good but I still love em all the same).  I bought a black Jason mask from Hot Topic and went to Curt's house after that to help with his halloween setup. 

Curt's had a coffin, strobe lights, fog machines, spiderwebs and just a really neat little haunted house set up. I ended up laying behind the coffin in all black and with the mask on...scaring kids as they came up and screaming ""LET ME OUT"" and ""Give me your candy"" or for the spanish kids..""Da Me Los Dulces!""  I ended up ripping my arm against a nail on the coffin so my left palm is well tore up.  It was a great time. I scared kids and had fun. Woohoo. 

Dracula's Ball was fucking psychotic. They really oversold the show and still had people who were turned away. We got up there and had to park like 3 blocks away from Shampoo. The line was almost as long but turns out it was the line for people without tickets.  We got there, I paid for parking and the line was good because we had tickets.  Jenny, Brian, Mori and myself got a prime spot by the stage for Voltaire and Cruxshadows. We danced to some cool music and eventually Kristyn, Fran, Mindy, Joe, and Melissa showed up and we did lots of pictures including my new display picture here on MySpace (or MyCrack as Voltaire would call it). I also saw Kim outside of the venue and Melanie as well.  :) 

Voltaire was great as always. He did the ""die die die die"" song which i can't remember the name of.  He did ""Goodnight Demonslayer"" which is one of my favorite songs ever and me and Jenny agreed that we both would sing that song to our kids eventually.  I just love it.   He ended up getting a girl dressed as a ""sexy kitten trombone player"" up on stage to do ""BRAINS"" and that went well.  He did ""Cannibal Buffet"" and ended up with ""When You're Evil"".  It was a great set and Kristyn's camera is phenomenal.  

The Cruxshadows set was good as well.  The crowd was getting to everyone by then however.  Brian was freaking a little, Kristyn and group left to get air and I was just trooping it out.  They had two hot dancers up on stage and it was Rogue (lead singer), a violinist and a guitarist..and a keyboardist.   They did a great remix of ""Cassandra"" with Ego Likeness during their encore and finished with ""Marilyn, My bitterness"" as usual.  Other highlights included ""Eurydice, Don't follow me"", ""Winterborn (Coming Home)"". 

Running out of time so i'm cutting it short....for now."

"event","I posted this on Myspace thursday night and since I worked yesterday, I got no comp time.  This is what I did last weekend....

My life is a never ending whirlwind of work, friends, music, and energetically positive chaos. 

Friday morning I worked at Borders and went through 8 hours there. I ended up talking to Mori and Kris for a bit after I got done.  Curt came and picked me up and I took care of some business before going to Scott's house for his surprise party. 

Scott's surprise party was pretty fun. Ariel did an awesome job setting it up with some help from Dave.  I had a good time, I wasn't the most talkative person but then again I wasn't the least talkative person and it was good to see Scott and Dave again.  I haven't been to Days of Knights in forever so none of the yugi crowd.  We ate, drank and listened to music. It was as Ariel put it a ""chill party.""

Saturday I had to get up at 5:30am and leave at 6am for work.  I worked 8-4pm at Borders and roamed around for the most part.  Curt came and got me again. We ended up driving to Deptford Mall so I could see Paul's Hot Topic ROCK store.  It's a pretty sweet little store. I thought it would be bigger but their rock wall was awesome.  The hoodie selection was great and just a lot of really neat things in there.  I didn't get anything although I was checking out a Transplants shirt and a few things.  

We went from there to the Starland Ballroom after much confusion in New Jersey. I know a few people in NJ but I have to say it. FUCK NEW JERSEY.   Finding that place was crazy and all the gas stations we went to...had no fucking clue.   We ended up talking to a Russian guy and his girlfriend who set us on the right path.  The Misfits/Balzac show was great.  I liked most of the openers (Deny the Myth, Divinity Destroyed, Flateus (sp?) and a few others.)  Balzac who is a japanese misfits style band came on stage around 10:45pm and tore the house up.    Curt and I were shouting ICHIBAN!! The Misfits got on stage at midnight and had an awesome stage setup.  Coffins, skulls and just halloween oriented.  They played so many songs it was psychotic.  Jerry Only didn't talk much between songs.  They played  Halloween I and II.  They played Skull and ""Die Die My Darling"" and they did a few old Black Flag songs as well.  

We hit the Roy Rogers on the NJTP on the way back and I was out of it by the time we got home at 2:30am (after the time change)."

"event","Thanks Beverly for calling me and letting me know about the cancellation of the reading this week.  I was sad to see it cancelled but maybe it means i'll have time to get myself ready for a shot at it whereas I definitely wouldn't have done it this time. :) 

The weekend cometh.   I've been talking about the events for at least a week now.  It's gonna be a good time..but a long time. 

Kristyn started at Borders this week.  She's only getting half the time to train that I did which sucks for her but i know she'll be fine. She's got lots of people to help her out. 

Working mostly mornings at Borders next week Monday, Wednesday-Friday and Saturday night.  HT is going to be Friday night, Saturday morning (hopefully) and maybe a day to be named later. 

I'm just about out of time in the library so that's it for me for now.

I'm going home and reading up on my health benefits at Borders and to make a few phone calls."

"event","Dear Livejournal, i'm sorry that i'm neglecting you so much lately.  Time is of the essence lately and hopefully I will get some more of it so that I can update all of my lovely friends about the comings and goings of my life. 


Apology...whoomp there it is. 

Update: XMW's first autograph signing/fan fest of 2005 was a huge success. If  you're interested in getting involved in a fledging wrestling promotion, e-mail me. xmwpublicrelations@yahoo.com

I've been busting my ass. I had a 13 hour day on Monday between my two jobs. I'm working 50 hours this week between them and throw in bus time as well. Everything is going well though. 

So much to do this week...same as before.  Birthdays, The Misfits show, Dracula's Ball is on Halloween night. 

The easiest way to find me right now is via my cell phone and i'm still playing phone tag with a few people.  Come visit me at work if you'd like.  between 8am and 6pm over the next four days you'll be able to find me either at Borders or Hot Topic. 

I just finished ""The Princess Bride"" book and am now reading ""Shaman's Crossing"" by Robin Hobb.   I'm still waiting on Princess of Mars for <lj comm=""ent_moot"">.

and i'm really have an entertaining week where it's coming to food and cleavage. The things you can do and the ideas you can have when you relate these things.

I have to get ready for work now though. 

Peace, Love and Gravy."

"event","Hanging out at <lj user=""dulcefire"">'s house like usual.  :) Just waiting for <lj user=""dramamonkey81""> to get done work and back around.  

Borders today was crazy. 8 hours on register and 500 crazy rabid Nora Roberts fans at the store for her appearance. 

I'm working 5-11:30pm Tuesday-Friday at Borders plus a day shot at HT on Thursday.  

Hung out with Curt yesterday and talking more business. I'm going to work on getting myself a professional mailing address for my responsibilities to our wrestling organization.  

There's so much stuff going on over the next two weekends. 

Next weekend: Working 5-11:30pm Friday at Borders, I want to get together with Curt and talk about the autograph session on Saturday to get a clue of what's going on and we may do a photo shoot as well.  Scheduled at Hot Topic from 5-9pm but I may see if someone else wants the hours. Curt also wants to go to the haunted house thing at the Wachovia Center later on that night. We'll see.  Sunday is the actual autograph session itself with 6 XMW superstars and then Bound for Glory. 

Halloween weekend is a mindfuck.  Party on Friday night. I'm not saying what it's about though..it's a surprise.  Saturday i'm trying to work morning at Borders (Friday as well) so I can go with Curt up to the Starland Ballroom and see the Misfits and Balzac: Atomic age vampire in 1301. He's gonna be awesome enough to pay for me, i'm gonna do my damnedest to go.  Sunday is pretty quiet and Monday i'm trying to work morning because there's the spooky thing at Curt's like last year and then Dracula's Ball with Voltaire and The Cruxshadows that night.

I've been hanging out lately mostly with Kris, Fran, Brian and Mori.  The work schedule and the convenience has just been there.  I've gotten to talk to Ashes a bit but I know i haven't had a lot to do with some of my other friends. A lot of people are in my head but I don't talk to them much. 

I need to call christina and jenny and a few others and see how life's going and see if i can make plans.  

things are generally well though and i'm sorry I haven't been able to be in some other people's lives as much as I want to be involved.  I <3 you all."

"event","Happy Birthday of course to <lj user=""twistednexus""> :)  Go October Birthdays...woo-hah. I'm sorry to the other people who's birthdays I've missed but the celebrations will be forthcoming. 

The weather is better and I feel a little better.  I took a few pairs of pants to my mom's today because she's going to make them smaller for me.  Working tonight, i'll get my headset and get to deal with Educator Appreciation week starting tonight. 

I'm still reading Pornified and progressing through it pretty well..sections on business of it and why men like porn and women who like and dislike porn and the argument of Porn vs Erotica.  

I'm thinking of doing a thread or just trying to start a discussion on porn on here to get people's opinions and the reasoning behind those opinions. It's a fascinating and controversal topic and i'm fascinated by people's thought processes.  

I got a few books from the free boxes at Borders including the 1st Bone graphic novel. Very cute and funny and I remember when the comic book came out.  I've got another fantasy book or two to read as well as the Pornified book and the Princess Bride novel that I got from the library. 

Things are going well all in all and i'll heading to work very soon.  

I probably will be on the computer again for a little while on Monday morning. 

Hope everyone has a great weekend. :)"

"event","Delaware is really going through a damp renaissance right now.  The rainy period has come and will just not let up at all.   I don't like being wet unless it's from a pool or from hard physical labor.  

I'll just quote the Jane Siberry song from The Crow Soundtrack...

""It can't rain all the time, your tears won't fall forever...""

Hopefully this rain ends tomorrow like it's supposed to do. 

I hung out with Brian, Mori, her sister Brandi/Brandy and her b/f Bob last night for a while. I got into the car and immediately zonked out though.  

Work was fun for the most part last night. I'm ready to be let loose on my own tonight. I met some more really cool people and I talked to Lisa a bit again last night. She's really cool and supposed to be adding me on MySpace soon.  

Got my schedule for next week..which is 12-8pm on Monday and i'm part of the event staff for Nora Roberts aKa J.D. Robb for anyone who's into romance novels.  I'm also training Tuesday through Friday from 5-11:30pm next week.  The nights will go down hopefully after this week.   Hot Topic schedule is only 2 days, the amount of nights is killing my hours there but i'm doing 10-4 next Thursday and 5-9pm next Saturday night. 

Emotionally, i think i've been semi-melancholic this week.  The weather is not helping as evidence of a few other struggles will prove.  I was having a long talk with kris about my romantic situation (lack thereof...no targets, no ideas....NOTHING) and about how I feel bad because I feel like a burden on people right now.  The night schedule at Borders is forcing me to get rides every night.  I've had a few of my co-workers already offer me rides which is very cool. I may end up taking up the offer tonight or tomorrow. I've also been unable to go out places with friends unless they end up paying for me or unless i just chill sit there and get water.  Hopefully the money stuff gets better soon.  

My friends are very understanding and will tell eme that I'm not being a burden but it's still something I feel within myself and I don't like it. 

Going very soon. I'm reading a book called ""Pornified"" by Pamela Paul right now..it's a sociological look at how pornography is affecting people's lives and relationships.  It's a very interesting read and i'm learning things about the industry and its affect and it makes me question my own involvement with porn. :)  

Always remember....Knowledge is power and music is freedom!!!"

"event",":) Okay....this is just an ego thing and it's meant to be mostly harmless but there is always a little bit of truth in it as well. 

I've heard ALL about the poetry drama. I've heard the poem in question. I've heard it in different stages of its development. It's definitely not a poem that should have been read at Word Dancing. It's the wrong crowd and the wrong style for the group of people down there. I don't condone the personal attacks and I don't condone the wording used for everything but the poem was entertaining for me. That being said..I am easily entertained and very sexual (hence the journal name and hence some of the references in my poetry).  Take it as you will.  It is art in its own way and it will offend people. 

All of the drama which I jokingly call ""the fun stuff"" happens when i'm not at parties, not at the readings, not involved.  

I have a reputation around some people as being the stick in the mud and as being the moral, responsible person.  That's who I am.  That's who I was raised to be and that's not going to change anytime soon.  

I can be very loose and crazy in ways.  My friends that I hang around a good deal know me and know what I do and they shake their heads at me occasionally as well. 

<b>Borders</b>
First night of training was great. A friend of a friend was training with me so that made it easier. She's going to be working in cafe.  Mori was around a bit last night and I made friends with at least one other person in the cafe.   It's a lot of information to take in and process but I can do it.  :)  I'm training 5-11 for the next 3 nights and then I work register on Saturday.  Kristyn starts at Borders next week which is awesome...we're slowly populating the bookstore with people me and mori know. LoL  Everyone's really cool so far and I saw like a half dozen people that I know. 

I hung out with Mori and Brian and Fran and Kris last night.  Brian and Mori left about 2:30, Fran and Kris and I talked for an hour and then Kris ended up talking with me for another hour and a half. It was a good night. I got in around 5am and my roommate remarked on that today.  It's been a good day. 

Running out of time...that's it for now..but i'll be on again either tomorrow or Friday...peace, love and gravy."

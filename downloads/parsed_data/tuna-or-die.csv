Update i guess.

Over the past few years, i've come to learn a lot from my ""random"" adventures... and my ""random"" encounters, ""random"" events, ""random"" road trips. i found myself looking for something that wasn't really there, i guess i was trying to prove to myself that there was something to find in life. I basically ran around in circles, and just got lost in the moment for too long. In doing so, though, i came to realize that i did learn a lot... and i did find what i was looking for, and that's  myself. All those endless nights, all those streetlight stories... those crazy weekends and never wanting to let it go, they all brought me back to me. 

All the people i met along the way, all the stories i shared with them, the experiences, how our lives intertwined for a mere second in this infinite time line... it all seemed worthless then, but in the end it's what made me learn who i wanted to be. I've spent days with some, months with others, from living in my car to living in different cities. I've seen things i never thought possible, i've done things i never thought i would do, i kept myself alive by knowing that one day... things were gonna get better. 

through this journey, i broke down multiple times... but it only showed me i was human. I kept my sanity and i picked myself up, and even now i'm fighting... but i know which direction i want my life to know. For those who have been there with me in this journey, past present and those of you who i haven't met yet, i wanna thank you. Even if we don't talk much or at all, you all have helped me become who i am today.

if i ever wronged you, hurt you, betrayed you, disgusted you, etc. i'm sorry i was like that in the past, and i'm sorry i shook a potentially strong foundation to a long lasting friendship. I am no longer that person, and if time permits, i would like to make amends with you all. i've come to praise and cherish a lot in life, and i've grown to be thankful for every second i'm still alive, and for everything i have in front of me, including the people who are close to me. 


i guess this is it for now, i'll be back when i'm back i guess"

i'm running circles 
can't leave the pattern
so i digress and follow myself,
but i find a crack on the floor
and slip through the grass
into this tin can filled with dust
and i become the breaking dawn
beyond my own recognition,
i'm no longer void.

where my shadow blends into the wall,
patterns eroding onto each other
while i play with the sharp blunt ridges
of this endless love story,
i can almost taste the irony 
dripping from my fingertips
as i realize i'm no longer me,
but the mere representation
of what i want to be
so i let go and float into the sky.

i remember tripping on a cloud
causing me to break through a thought,
knocked over a chain of events 
that ultimately led to my religion,
sculpted of the coffee i drink
to keep me going through the day,
i believe i'm falling into this again.

i no longer fear my nightmares,
since night is non existent...
i think i can't believe in daymares
since the light can't always be angelic.
the day i was born i spit out 
my only recollection of birth,
i gave it to the doctor 
who took me from the nothing
from which i came,
look what a mess he made. 

i used to take walks to think,
but thinking took on thoughts
to which i can't remember any
so now i sit and wonder
what to think about my thoughts
but nothing comes to mind. 

yelling through my pillow 
i sing myself to sleep,
hoping that this endless journey
has a sort of end in sight.

till that day i'll walk this roundabout
hoping to find my way out."

i saw you sitting on the edge of your cup
dipping your toes into the froth

forgetting that the foreign touch

i whispered in your ear

i slipped and fell into a coma
woke up 30 years later without my heart,
I'd lost my voice in your hands

and hung it on the ceiling,
drops of lust leaking from the faucet,
took one look to break his lock
and from the moment 
he began to feel real again.

late night phone calls
ringing deep within the walls
a distant man in uniform 
sings a heavier song,
today was the day i
began to feel ashamed of
wishing every second of my life
was a play by play scenario
of things i coulda been and
done without the words to say.

so he shook off the 4 am smell
he had left in his pocket,
saving time to waste it again tomorrow.
the veins in his arms already
tainted by the hollow heart he drew on the floor
his half lit smile surrounded
by the burning taste of dry skin,
but even through the pain he grinned. 

when the sun begins to shine
and things are never darker in the light,
the only hand you see is yours 
an older version of yourself.
you're not getting younger
you're not going to believe in things like god,
but you keep on pushing off these curtains
keep that dreary eye ajar for things
you know you love.

he took the brush and painted tomorrow,
as if today was already worn and old
and let the sun light fill the canvas
burned the edges and told himself
this was another distant future,
so he washed his hands and pried his face
from the murky life he had survived.
Another dreamer longing for 
a boat to save him from these waters.

keep on shining lovely,
clear those beautiful eyes 
they look better when you smile,
your laugh is the only thing that makes it
all the worth to write,
you're the rustle in the hottest days
waiting for the night to bring us home."

looking over shoulders 
carried older by the dozen,
this turning plate
has me spinning in my head
allowed to linger on the ashes
of this burning lost idea.

You're putting up an endless army
on the streets by streetlight choices,
echoing in empty cars like vultures
waiting to destroy this seamless
dress the night bestows on screaming voices, 
same distraught extinguished
soldiers walking in the shadows
drinking from the bottles 
laughing through the pointing arrows
leading to the end of night,
as tomorrow will begin to break the light
a conundrum filling ends without a sound
and maybe you and i will finally be found. 

when i lost myself in this distress
girl i wondered where it is i would have crashed
because of every turn i lost my way
captured by this lonesome mistress
euphoric distortion in the wind
within the swindle of romantic encounters
or how the music helps and it empowers
me to be the one i want to be,
the metaphoric sadistic heretic,
this pirate set adrift to sea
and through my years i became prophetic
but i never thought i'd be like me. 

Because i lost my way a time or two, 
forgot how to button my shirt and tie my shoe
got lost in the distance while looking in the mirror
to find myself a million miles away,
and no this isn't a sappy love note
or a story, but you and i became ""his"" story,
and mine as yours while yours is mine
and still your voice resonates in my mind
a perfect sliver of this midnight romance
sifting through these aging hands.

And while the valley's burning
it's my love that's never ending 
for the swoon i took when i was younger
and courted blindly when i should have been stronger,
I learned this coldly when heaven sank
and lust became my only friend 
my hourglass so fragile cracked 
and i gave away my dying light
all the while i knew i couldn't breathe
so i let us go into the past."

drank from the skull of a killer
and danced with a gun to my head.

A disclaimer to all:
the dreams i've witnessed 
couldn't narrow it down
to the blunt knife i've played with
while i walked with the dead.

this sort of,
metaphorical suicide 
that would sleep in my bed.

Such a quiet morrow broken
by a mere fragment of diluted light,
breaking through the tinted mirrors of my eyes.

The room a stale fragrance of the night before,
even the slightest of sound 
like a bullet in the night.

Echoes crawling down the hall
shattering into my room,
such a mess i'd hate to clean
but as soon as i return a glance
into a million crows they gather,
and fly away into the dark."

slightly altered by your smile,
you've become the mimicked song
of every bird i hear,
and every morning when i wake
it's your name they scream to me.

I've come to get used to 
leaning on the coming winds,
such a comfort in breaking 
while they softly merge 
into my arms.

like wounded lyrics they read
sad and manic they intertwine
to become the morning, noon, and night.
My sorrow, love, and hate. 

This sentencing of every fate we greet,
our love a tomb where our fingers play,
plagued by every taste our lips desire
a symphony of angels gathered by the stars.

This sonnet filled between each touch
as loss of breath begins to fall
while you and i become the sun
forever on we'll sit aloft.

Mine on yours
let the moment engulf the laughter
if it falls then so will we,
and in the dark we'll make them see
this is no ordinary love."

infiltrate my ever
conscious resolutions,
filling me through
waves of neon
in the first enticed 
blue rays of the sun.

How the thought of you
exhumes the day into night,
the very sorcery of
cradled sirens humming 
deep with swallowed coral
by the ocean's last conception.
I bring myself to you again.

Throughout this time of silence
this present void in my life
I've devoted myself to all the wrong ideas,
sheltered myself beneath a sunset
i never thought i'd see again,
i've been my own abuse
and self detest within these walls
perfectly constructed 
to avoid the light of day
from giving me the strength i need.

I've seen but a glimmer
dancing through the cracks
i've tried to carve into this prison,
attempting to disrupt this conscious
from becoming stale and fragmented,
it's been a life too brooded over
and without the reason i have now
it was a life that stole my soul.

I had fully bloomed but never known,
became a shadow underground
without the sun to make me whole.

I've swallowed this desire 
to finish even this piece today
but three years has been too long love,
i'd love to say i'm  back again. 

To speak the words i've kept so long
and start this chapter of my life."

sickened by dipping our feet
into this pawn
sewn into the affection,
recognized and delivered within perfection

confused and set aside

let it go and recognize our lies
permitted to be shut out by our eyes,
and now we're gone.

we are atoms floating in the wind,
losing touch with every fling
ideas clouded by the rising doubt 
in every dream once seen to shine,
we are ashes blown into the fire
back to where we once began
to start the cycle of love and heart ache
brought to the other by a random interval,
we're nothing but the painting
before the canvas has been sewn.

i see you catching every stutter,
setting us to fire by avoiding every truth
inclined to let us sink into oblivion
holding my head under water so i can't hear,
you tell me what you wish you could

this sober conundrum has me riding 
on the trails i've known the best,

seeing things between the lines

So soon to leave you,
too bad i had to go
i couldn't hush these shadows

to light the sky so empty
killing stars above,
every laughing gesture
confounded by the sun.

infatuated (as well as i am)

When the earth fell upside down
my eyes confounded by the smoke,
i pulled myself out of this burning plane

Had the moon taken you in her arms,
my heart a broken sigh
would never let itself blossom

it's you the sky reminds me of
forever in the sun
the vision of your velvet eyes
will feel the reciprocal of mine

i'll breathe for you.

a symphony i'll compose

a commotion that engulfs any given
sort of solitude in a second,
between each sporadic cry for help

shooting down to earth,
as if to plummet deeper than it should.

where the earth stands still

concrete jungles laid flat like plains,
losing themselves like animals without boundaries,
without a sound they grow
and without a care they live.

in every breath they whisper
of coming floods and disasters,
prophecies gone unheard and misunderstood,
so they reach out like helpless beasts
to tear the sun from the heavens,
drink from the rivers to feel the pain
and dissolve into the sea 
and become one with the shying tides
to never return from their pilgrimage.

tell these creatures of the moon,

through broken windows
and doors left ajar
they'll follow you into the night,
worshipers of the voice of reason
now yours as they are drones,
to see you become the deity of life,
a new civilization in every choice you make.

where you have reason in every sigh,
though unholy and absurd
your silence burns through every pore.

become the god of lust,
and dampen any hopes of reservation
for any one person looking for the cure.

never let yourself be heard
for the fern that dwells 
in every tree will lead you
where you need to be.

"event","08 is finally coming to a close. 
what a fucking year. 

i met some of the most amazing people this year, and i'm not regretting anything. True there were lots of.. uhm... things to enhance my year... but hey... it's a part of life. For those of you who stuck by and well... are still here, i love you guys. 

Mason, Banish, the ffa guys, Masha, Nena, Presley, and whoever else i missed... you have made this year quite interesting. 
Banish and Mason, what else can i say but HaV-oK?!

Here comes 09, lets see what goes down this year. Oh.. and Friday is going to be an awesome day. They said that 21 was gonna be a good year, i had no reason to be optimistic... but i did brave that weather. 

22 looks like it's already going to be amazing. 
So Happy New Years everyone, i really hope you get everything you feel you need."

"event","It's different really... seeing someone able to let go so easily. over a struggle they haven't even put up... when from day one it should've been the other person to let go completely. No matter how many people told him to... just let go... that it wasn't worth it... he still stayed there... why? not even he knows.

But when the other, decides that he hasn't put up that much of an effort... that he hasn't even been trying... well that's on that person. and if that person is ""losing"" him effortlessly.. well then my love, there wasn't an effort put in there in the first place. 

Funny. 

But at the same time, it makes me question everything that was seen as such a strong foundation in the first place.

I've been there since day one... and still remain there... always there for when you decide to talk to me again... when you decide that you miss me... when you decide that you've made bad choices, i've been there with you. 

and now... 

just like that..

wow.

Well no matter what. 
you'll always be there in my heart. you may say you're losing me... but just now i'll never lose you.

Why? because i'm not gonna allow it."

"event","<em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead&hellip; but the world keeps spinning&hellip;&rdquo;</em><br /><br />Like blinding lights every thought racing through my head almost made me convulse at the intensity I had made it, my body shivering with cold sweat. Throughout my delirium I could feel my chest compressing and I found it harder and harder to breathe. Every gasp for air was a sudden .jolt of pain on my stomach, I wanted to get up and move but my body was heavy and almost surreal&hellip;<br /><br /><em>&ldquo;Kayne sweetie please stop throwing your toys on the floor! I already told you I can&rsquo;t do this THIS early in the morning baby&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />The car seat had dried cookie crumbs all over it, and smelled of orange juice. Kayne&rsquo;s feet dangled just beyond the car seat&rsquo;s edge, almost as if to venture off into a long fall. <br /><br />Nicole looked down at the car seat in dismay, grabbed some napkins and started cleaning the crumbs off of the seat. Raising a child as a single mother is always a challenge, cookies and orange juice have never been more destructive before. She looked up to see a man on the floor next to his car. <br /><br />Her heart skipped a beat when she realized it was his car, she knew why he was there and why it had happened. His body motionless almost struck a chord in her heart, but she shot it down knowing not to get too attached. As pitiful as he seemed, she wouldn&rsquo;t allow him to let him take advantage of her no matter the situation. <br /><br />&ldquo;You son of a bitch&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered through her teeth.</em><br /><br /> Why did I open my eyes again? No matter how hard I fought it, the room was spinning faster than I could keep my eyes from darting to the back of my head. I moved up and tried getting leverage by putting my body weight on my elbows, but my left side almost ripped open. Carol ran up to me almost dropping the folders she was holding and helped me lay back down on the pillow. <br /><br />&ldquo;Oh my god, you should try being more careful you know&hellip;&rdquo; her voice broke through the chaos and helped me zone in on reality. She brushed my hair with her fingers, and for those few seconds the room stopped spinning. Such a sudden shock with reality made me sit up and vomit, not too much of a happy welcome back. Good thing the trash can was empty, I would&rsquo;ve spilled all over her pretty shoes. <br /><br />&ldquo;You know something, you&rsquo;re still cute&hellip; even when you&rsquo;re this vulnerable.&rdquo; she said with a smile on her face. <br /><br />Looking up, I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at her. I tried thanking her, but instead was greeted with another mouthful of vomit. How amazing was that. <br /><br />&ldquo;Sweetheart, don&rsquo;t force yourself to do anything right now, you&rsquo;re not going to be back to your old self for a while. Your wife came in today&hellip;&rdquo; she stopped for a second and looked at me.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ex&hellip;&rdquo; I coughed out loud, &ldquo; lets not get anything jumbled up here..&rdquo; <br /><br />My throat was sore from lack of salivation, I could still taste the medicine coming back up my stomach. I reached down to my left side and felt stitches lining my stomach. <br /><br />&ldquo;I have some bad news for you though&hellip;&rdquo; Carol hesitated yet again, this time she wouldn&rsquo;t look at me, &ldquo; we found a tumor in your liver Mr. Winters, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s malignant.&rdquo;<br /><br />I felt the pillow drop from below me and felt myself fall down 50 stories, my heart had stopped for what seemed an eternity. I couldn&rsquo;t help but picture my son&rsquo;s smile as I hit the floor, how the hell would I tell him his only father wasn&rsquo;t going to be there for him??<br /><br /><br />(To be Continued)&hellip;"

my crisis angel! Te-re-sa! woot!

I've been out and about... basically trying to get my new life up and going. I'm still writing, as you can see (if you're reading my page). I've been trying to change up my style, and it seems to be working, most of the writings i put out today mostly relate to the music i've been tuning in to. It's a pretty big reflection as to what my mood has been bringing me, but it's all good. 

More later, gotta go back to work. 

PS- Congratulations on my Mom and Sandra's 10 year ann. As much as i ask myself why they're still together... i guess as long as they find some form of happiness together."

"event","When all the world broke down in shame, her lips were his to use. To mold and shape, disintegrate, forget about the pain. He swept her up and took her out, and told her she was his, broke her crown, ignored the frown and froze her lips on his.

She took his face and turned it red to match the shades on hers, drowned him in the wave of his to bend the smile on hers, recalled the truth that sewn them shut, and they never wanted to let go.

Because it never really ends when something has begun, and they knew this day would come. To breathe each breath as one in whole, and lose themselves again. To try and hide behind the night, and clouds to keep them safe. And through and through they laid as one, as no one else could imitate. 

They know it can't be helped, to be the one the other oh so hates. Because of time and lands apart, it's too hard to collaborate. But each new moon will bring them close, forever heavy in the woods."

Having tons of extra time is something i really don't like. Now that i'm home more than out, i'm constantly trying to find something to do that does not consist of my cat sitting on my lap while i browse the music channels. Write maybe? Sleep? Well writing, of course i do it... sleeping? Not so much. I've actually been deprived of sleep for the last couple of weeks.... leaving me wide awake till about 6am, when i knock out for about an hour or two and wake up just in time to get ready for school. Why? Because i can't bring myself to sleep.

If anybody out there... still reads this, and you have time to kill in the hours of the am... please let me know. I'd be more than happy to go on an adventure. No one really.... does that anymore. Just... drive around, hang out, coffee? Perhaps a random drive over to a friend's house because... they bought a new movie? No... nothing like that anymore.

I opened my eyes and felt the light sting the back of my head. I moved my hands over to block the glare but couldn't bring myself to move my arms. I started to freak out, and tried moving my arms again. A hand held my chest down and two more held my arms down. I felt a pinch in my left arm, and everything started to slow down. I looked up and saw a silhouette waving at me in the corner of my eye. It almost looked sorry for me.<br /><br /><em>I let the phone ring five times before i hung up this time. It was almost comforting, the endless ringing on the other side of the kitchen phone, i'm almost certain she's there just staring at it. <br /><br />Ring...ring....ring....<br /><br />&quot;Pick up the phone.... pick it up.... come on. Pick up...the fucking phone...&quot; <br /><br />Click.<br /><br />&quot;I give up. If you want to fucking talk to me, then you call me. Wait...fuck. I can't do this again, I always do this. If i don't take him this weekend, she's going to throw this shit back in my face.&quot;<br /><br />I picked up the phone again, and started dialing the numbers to this oh so predictable story. It rang once, and i took a deep breath. It rang a second time, and i gave up. I pulled the phone away from my ear and heard a soft voice muffled through my hand. I pulled the back to my ear and replied:<br /><br />&quot;Hello?&quot; i asked as if she was the one calling me.<br /><br />Through the noise in the background i could hear people yelling out for her, &quot;Hello? Who's this?&quot; she asked half laughing.<br /><br />&quot;It's....&quot; i couldn't bring myself to talk to her. <br /><br />I hung up the phone and burried my face into my hands.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /> <br />I woke up feeling like someone had hit me in the back of the head with a baseball. My jaw was sore and i couldn't move my legs. I looked over to the window on the right, and realized i don't have a window on the right wall of my room. My eyes widened open, and i shot up like a bullet. My arms were filled with needles and tubes, it almost made me sick watching all the different liquids running to and from my hands. A lady in white came in to the room presenting herself as Nurse Carol, almost whispering her name into the curtain she was pulling from around me, her voice stopped short of my ear.&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;How're you feeling today Mr...&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Fine fine, where am i??&quot; i cut her off before she could finish her sentence. I couldn't bear the softness of her voice, it made it awkward and almost hard to breathe. <br /><br />&quot;You're in Verity Hospital, they had to rush you over to the Hospital in an emergency... your liver failed on you today Mr..&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Shit...&quot; i whispered through a sigh. I knew it would all catch up to me sooner or later, but not on my way to work. I can't help it if one beer turns into three or four...or ten. Who can resist a clean buzz on a saturday?<br /><br />&quot;You should be thankful you know, you're lucky we got an anonymous call telling us you were found barely breathing next to your car.&quot; She rolled a cart with some food on it next to my bed. Her eyes almost melted into the sunlight breaking through the window, her hair black as black can be, and her skin pale and milky, almost delicate and fragile looking. <br /><br />&quot;I guess I should be.... i guess i should....&quot; I closed my eyes for a second and felt my eyes weighed down by her presence. It almost felt safe enough to sleep again. <br /><br />(To be Continued...)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","""She's not a girl, who misses much.""<br /><br />I slammed my foot on the breaks and veered the car over to the left, screeching to a rather loud halt. I could see the skid marks leading to my car's location through the rear view mirror, and i could see the man in his car staring at me as if i had just landed on this planet. His head lay bald with strange patches of hair making an almost disgusting pattern through his scalp. I could swear i heard him praying through those sealed lips of his, the sweat on his nose was beginning to drip down to his mustache. If eyes could speak, he'd be almost degrading me through those glasses of his. Who could blame him, i almost rear ended a parked car. <br /><br />The tires had begun to smell of burnt rubber, making me sick to my stomach. The coffee i had bought at the gas station was now over my dashboard, and let me tell you that coffee and burnt leather do <i>not </i>make a good scent. I tried to start the car but the ignition wouldn't turn, pumped the gas a couple times and tried to turn the car on again, nothing. Outside an older woman was staring at me with disbelief, her jaw split open like a damaged coconut. I looked back at her, opened the door and threw my keys out into the street. I stumbled out of my seat belt and jumped out of the car. I walked around it as if i knew what i was looking for, as if i were some kind of mechanic here to save the day.<br />I could barely hammer a nail into a cardboard box, i had no clue as to what to do. <br /><br />I've been letting her cross my mind more and more, and it's making it difficult to return to reality. Today i was lucky, i realized i was going almost 65 miles an hour towards a car that had stopped at a red light. My hands were beginning to shake, and the adrenaline was beginning to subside. I felt a sharp pain shoot through my lower stomach, almost like lightning striking a metal rod. I was finding it harder and harder to breathe, and when i thought i could count on the older woman for help, she was already half way down the block.&nbsp; My vision blurred in and out of focus, and i fell to my knee.<br /><br /><i>She always knew when i came home drunk. She had left a small piece of paper pinned to the door reading, "" We need to talk, just not tonight. I don't want to deal with you.""<br /><br />I hobbled over to the bedroom door and gave a light tap with my fingers, but there was no answer. I wiggled the door nob and found the door to be unlocked. I walked into the room and rubbed my eyes clear, walked up to the bed and threw my jacket on the floor. Everything was gone, her clothes, pictures, makeup, jewelery, and the crib. Kayne was only a few weeks away from being born, and i was already fucking up. I don't know why i can't sleep with her in our bed, a sense of intrusion always comes through me when i see her there, holding our baby in her stomach. I felt myself about to throw up, but couldn't make it past the bedroom door. Shit. <br /><br /></i>(To be Continued...)"

If it hadn't been for the constant push from my will, i would have thrown that car off the side of the road multiple times. But instead, i brushed it all away.</i><br /><br />It had been only a couple of days since i last had decent sleep, and my eyes had built a nest underneath their heavy bottoms, sinking deeper into my already deteriorating demeanor. i had ignored the white hairs making their presence on my head, just to buy me a couple more years on this crashing ship i call life, but this stress had me feeling the weight of my health. I reached over to steal a tissue from the counter, and walked out of the house. And casually denied myself from greeting the old worn out face that always tends to sit there at the door, waiting to say good bye to me again. I've heard that phrase too many times before, one more time would just make me late to work.<br /><br />I'd begun to feel sorry for myself for many things, and this wasn't helping my habit of smoking two packs a day. After the first four cigarettes i would convince myself that stopping now would be ridiculous. The chronic cough wouldn't stop after i would choose not to smoke for a day, if it's inevitable why not go with it? Why not tie the noose to a fate i know is coming, specially if my health care had expired months ago. My hair had begun to knot, and i wasn't doing much to stop it. My face, well lets just say that it compliments the black wool sweater my mother would try to make me wear during Christmas dinner. <br /><br />I walked into the car and found myself in tears. Banging on the roof of my car while screaming at the top of my lungs didn't help me get away with much. At least it let me see how many neighbors i actually had. It's been hard you know, trying to go on from day to day, not being able to change the last line of the your favorite movie, not being able to tell the judge the killer is not actually the killer, not being able to accept the fact that the sun won't go down when i think it's too hot. Not knowing why my life had ended up on the verge of insanity, all because i didn't follow the signs. <br /><br />I had seen her walking down the street a few days before my breakdown, with her hair around her eyes. Typical that i couldn't see her smile from a distance, she hadn't smiled for me since the last time i had told her i loved her. Her strut was always that of a proper woman, but her hair that of a devilish fiend. I couldn't recognize her by her outfit, but it hit me once she stood across from me. I hadn't seen her in years and it triggered an avalanche of thoughts, so I walked up to her to grab her attention but a knot came across my heart and i stepped backwards. A little boy jumped out of a car she was standing next to and ran up to her legs. She knelt down and took him into her arms and kissed him on the cheek, whispered something into his ear and waved at the person in the car. <br /><br />It had been four years since i had last told her i couldn't do it anymore, four years where i couldn't bring myself to call her up every 23rd of August to wish my son a happy birthday. In these four years, too much had changed. So i pulled myself from her direction and grabbed a smoke from it's box. I walked into my car and shut the door with a thud. I flicked the lighter and hesitated smoking the first of many cigarettes, but gave in too quickly. I took a puff and forgot what i had been so worried about, so i just sat in the car. Thinking about everything, and nothing in life. <br /><br />(To be continued...)"

that people don't stop
at a red light,
if they know that
there's someone waiting
for them
back at home.

And when you come back,
love,
you'll find the most beautiful garden,
you'll find the biggest 
most gorgeous array
of exotic aromas
coming your way.

And maybe, 
you'll find me waiting for you
with two hundred roses
i dried on a basket,
with two hundred wishes 
i heard in your dreams
of seeing me happy
when you came back
hoping to see your garden young.

So lets start this now love,
just take me there
so i can make sure
you'll be able to trust me
when you've gone away,
so i can start planting
the most beautiful flowers
for your return back home."

the sky at night,
are making wine 
of every cloud
and getting drunk
without a care,
into this laughing
cough they weeze
and lost in thought
these dreams 
begin to drip
into the cotton
hiding in the trees.

About to board
the shooting trains
on lonely raindrops
held by autumn,
every second inked
into the windows
by the pressing 
skin on frosted glass
will melt away
by daybreak come
beyond the starving
gaze interrupted
by the sun,
and dropped into 
a river to forget 
the nights
the moon returned 
to be a slave.

With golden chains
locked in the dark,
the lack of air
will break into the night
and leave its mark
around the stars,
stale and moldy 
the will fall 
like molten rock
and fill the shrouds
with poisoned breaths
that will secure the 
rise and fall of fear
within the pyramids 
of salt polluted
by the quiet
loss of love."

every spark in search
of something,
lighting through the
darkened chamber,
it alone will fill the night.

And in the slight
aroused misfortune,
it took the room
by sheer excitement,
breaking mirrors
in the dark.

And she took
the daggers,
to create a boastful
dinner,
for the pearls
within her eyes
were ivory 
when she loved,
but now lay faux
through longing souls.

So she drew blood
from every grimace,
seeking to enjoy
the thought of he
entwined
around her fingers,
to respond like sweat
when she couldn't
help but fade away.

Extinguished passion
resting by her feet,
she picked the salt
from every reason
he had sold her vows,
to drink the shoulder
he would gift her
in seasons bold
as fire.

Left her speechless,
body made of gold.

Let her sink 
below the fever
she had sweat 
to hear him cry,
but he tore her crown
and made her kneel,
questioned love
would never
taste so sweet.

She's just 
a haunted devil,
sensual to every smile
that dares to crawl
across her face,
beginning to embrace
this burning chalice 
she has stolen,
tamed incisions in her heart.

Don't let go
of those ambitions,
they're the drink you need to take.
Its a morose 
suppressed collision
when this treason 
turns your head."

"event","If i stole a whisper
i'd colour it blue for you,
if you only knew.

If there was a castle
i'd steal its flags,
and tell you i
had made them 
out of papermache
i know you like the shade.

Because i know
how much it means,
to sit alone 
and not alone,
because i know
that sometimes 
i need to breathe.

And after i return to you,
i hope i fall into your trap
and float away
atop your smile,
and if that smile 
would start to break,
i'd light a candle 
for the day,
because i know 
it helps to feel alive.

So lets jump over
and become the sun,
and into the night
we'll hide the stars,
fool around
behind the clouds,
and forget the 
rest of us back home,
it helps to drift away.

And in the pillows
near the dark,
we'll color prisms
into clay
pretending doves
become the crowns
the trees adorn 
and bushes hate.

And if i were to slip
into the sky,
i'd hope to catch my smile
before the rain
would wash it all aside.

Remembering the soft parade
that danced around our
electric beauty,
to meet the speed
of shining eyes
wherever we would fly,
would ever be so shy
to let us feel alone,
and so we would run.

To think the thief
succumbed to you,
stealing you away
from dreams
and aspirations,
i can't believe
that you don't
remember me.

We sat on walls
watching ultra
florescent individuals
become eternal in the fog,
collecting star dust 
in our hands
we became 
the shouting winds.

Running in the dark
before the rising sun
to keep the truth 
from melting,
taking vows
behind champagne bottles
to ourselves in different patterns.

We were fire
raging in the tails
of every shooting star
we drank away,
and when there
was a moment left
we'd think about
the rest of them
and shook our heads.

Tell me where you've gone,
because i can't imagine
you anymore.
Why i can't obscure
this painful glare
laughing at my face."

of every solstice dripping from the sky,
in every tangled individual 
there would lie a sense of
unison beyond the dream
of equality,
of inter-relations of non existent
serendipity,
who float like fire through the lights
like clouds that dance in broken fog,
in twos and threes, 
while my eyes are blurred
enough to see the love.

I took my love into the crowd,
and found we melded well
like ice,
amidst a sea of fire
where our sweat would tear
the innocence,&nbsp;
to every other laughing soul.

Through her rhythm mine adorned
by microscopic smiles abhored,
i found her hiding&nbsp;
on my lap,
and gave her static past her eyes.

In this cistern i believe
i found the secret to our lives,
in this temple i have come
to give myself to her.

The temple of the Blue Buddha
will crumble by the dawning of the sun,
but i will never let it hide again
for i have seen the fields of love."

sing for her streams of guilt.

she'll become this echo,
staining every choice
i bleed in faith,

in the hopes that i
will come to terms.

With dying eyes
i've grown immune,
to this admirable
yet untouched dust
building on the stars
we used to carve,
when they themselves
were nothing but remarks
painted on my wall.

As every passing look
has withered softly,
to the fires we extinguished
by the fleeting hours
slain with scorn
and resonance.

And now this candle
burns like cancer,
shutting out the hope
for answers
cursing every moment
like a million
tears shed for none.

Dancing in the shadows
of a glooming dawn,
the day will pass
on this desertion,
drowned in quick sand
passion numbed sensation,
to be recorded as a murder
of every prayer marked
like witches.

To be the reason
why it hurts to breathe
as every breath is torn
through ashes,
it hangs too loosely
to be forgotten
into a locket made of clay,
to remember her

the martyr dressed
in blood red nightingales."

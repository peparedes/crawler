"event","don't you sometimes spend a couple of a hours in the middle of the night thinking about what went wrong, the stupid things you said to hurt people, wishing u could take them back or apologise to those people right now even though its totally outdated and ridiculous?<br />i looked back on my life over the last few years and i can't remember a single moment that i had been truly happy, nada, zilch. i can't think of any significant moments at all. i have achieved nothing but made people cry, scar them for life, say hurtful things that just came out of my mouth without being processed thru the brain. said nasty things just because i hate my sorry ass life that didn't turn out the way my parents wanted it to. <br />6 years of my life gone in a total whirlwind i can't go back and set things right, i can't take back the tears and scars i caused, i can only look back and feel all fucked up about it. i guess thats the thing about making mistakes in life huh, that its not the person you scarred that suffers, its you because you have to live with the guilt of hurting some innocent person, or not innocent. either way, nobody should ever be treated in any ways mean by anyone. <br /><br />i don't think i have any right to be mean to anybody, or inflict any sort of pain emotionally or physically (well not exactly) because i have been probably one of the worst person i could ever be in the last 6 years of my life. its so fucked up it feels like i'm filled with venom to the very brim of me. i'm so bitter about everything that i punished everyone around me for it even though the only person that should be punished is me, cus i could've made my life better but i chose to wallow in it. not that the people i hurt are innocent people, i mean, i guess they're innocent cus they didn't deserve what i did. but nobody's TOTALLY innocent, and if theyre not, its still not up to me to <em>do unto them what they did to others. </em>(okay i don't actually know how that quote went) but you get drift. it's not up to me. <br /><br />isn't this what nobody's supposed to say openly? admit to the fact that they've been mean and hurtful to people around them just because they're actually jealous of others being genuinely happy and are just bitter cus their lives suck? admitting to this is definitely a slap to the face isnt it? <br /><br />not like there's more to lose anyways. i think whats worse is that even though i feel like this is seriously the horriblest person i've ever felt i've been, somehow it doesnt feel like its gunna be the worst. but admitting to that means smth, doesnt it? that i'm trying to stop that from happening, or smth. <br /><br />i'm sorry to every person i've hurt in any way. i know this is probably the most insincere way anyone could make an apology. but i truly am, i'm sorry that i didn't find a better way to deal with the shit i had and vented my frustration on you instead. i'm truly sorry, i can't take back what i did but i can try to make it up to any of you by changing for the better and not hurt you ever again.<br /><br />the society's getting more and more fucked up everyday cus the world is growing so materialistic. i really don't think i'll even live to see me at 30 cus just living's so cumbersome and depressing i might just wear out into thin air. i find it so hard to even live with myself, idk how someone as wonderful as you would wanna put up with me. <br /><br />on another note, grass is green, the sky is a beautiful shade of blue all over, bakchor mee is awesome, cuscaden's chicken wings are tasty, and you are amazing, and your beautiful voice makes melodies in my heart.(: maybe life's not too bad sometimes, just seek some sorta comfort and relief in certain things and maybe life wouldn't be that hard to get by right? <br /><br />who even reads this? its incoherent and wordy. words of a repressed bad english bittergourd, rolling her eyes as she finishes this off.<br /><br /><br /><br />"

maybe u should just learn to be more appreciative of the good things that happen to you, be grateful for them rather than harp on the bad things that happen. you'd be so much happier. 
sometimes i swear i even see the perpetual frown on these people's faces. like for crying out loud, cheer up wont you?"

sent dad to the airport, sent brother to tuition, very hungry.
cramps started, met clar, breakfast at pontian fareast, cramps got worse, sat on the toilet floor for half an hour, puked. dragged my sorry ass out of the toilet. starving. downed a cup of teh o, stuffed 2 fried wantons down my throat. wanted to puke again. clar drove my car home, stuffed my face with a mc chicken burger. got home, walked her out to get a cab and no cab came, we were struggling to hold onto our umbrella, we looked so pathetic. we were only short of the umbrella flipping upwards. it was pouring, so i drove her to town again cus i was feeling better. (yea ha-ha)
then my brother called and i picked him up from bishan on my way home and dropped him off in town, again. then mum called so i had to drop by j8's supermarket to get some chicken wings for a barbecue tonight.

i am famished.

if you take the second option, then depression comes along. depression is unnecessary self pity and sadness, more than what you are entitled to feel.&nbsp;
and when u sink into depression, thats when u start to annoy your friends."

so u see, holidays aren't that great. i'm currently clueless about my future, which sucks. and while you're stuck home with nothing better to fill your time with than the telly, you start mimicking characters you watch, like, Rachel Greene, Chandler Bing, Liz Lemon, Tracey Jordan, Marshall, Lily, and the occasional Kim Possible. before you know it, its 6 or 7pm, someone comes home, and the first thing they see is me - picture this: slob on the couch, oversized tshirt thats overstretched around the neck, a pair of shorts that do not match, probably not the right fit either. hair all over the face, occasional drool stains on the pillow. eyes? you can't even tell if she's asleep or just stoned. righttttt, so. not. sexy.&nbsp; 
so u have 2 takes on this, choose to be really cruel and ask her 'have u nothing better to do with your life? go do something more constructive!'

'aiyo so poor thing, k lets go out for a dinner.' 


i'm hoping for the latter tonight. hehe.

You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie

And who am I to judge you
In what you say or do
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance's an honest strategy
Leaves me grappling with my pride
But through the years insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize-fighter
Still trapped within my youth

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
I've watched whil love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again....</pre>"

Like every day's the last
Without a simple goodbye
It all goes by so fast

And now that you've gone
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough
For you to hear me now

Gonna open my eyes
And see for the first time
I let go of you like
A child letting go of his kite

There it goes, up in the sky
There it goes, beyond the clouds
For no reason why
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough

1) the last time i spoke to u properly or even said hi to you was nearly 3 years ago, u don't even know what i've been doing unless u see tell me you've seen me act like a slut with your own eyes 
2) we both know you've never liked me since secondary school for who knows what reasons 
3) i cannot believe that you chose to call out to me just 2 days ago when u saw me at Starbucks and the next day i hear that you're calling me a slut 
4) dude. own up to the things you say, okay? i can't stand girls that resort to crying to get their way. its disgusting. 
5) the only thing i cannot stand more than the things you said about me is that you're exactly like the breed of ppl that i said i never ever want in my life, spreading rumours when you're not even certain of the truth. 
6) I DO NOT GRIND GUYS (STRANGERS) DAMNIT. i don't even grind my guy friends. okay maybe just one person, but that guy ended up being my boyf for the past 6 months. pls lah okay, i might not even the most decent human being alive, i might have dated a lot of ppl but if there's one place i'm most decent at its at clubs, even when i'm pissed drunk. 
7) when ppl ask me about you, all i say is that you didn't like me and it pissed me off that you still chose to stick around in the same clique and went behind my back telling the rest that you didn't like me and i shouldnt be included in outings, i felt humiliated and so i stopped hanging out with you guys altogether. (i feel so childish for even talking about this its so idiotic haha)

i seriously (again) don't know what your problem is.

"event","A surprised me with tickets to Twillight last night! he met me telling me that we had tickets for Nick &amp; Norah at 820 and so we had to hurry for dinner and while we were happily seated and the lights went off and the screen displayed the words Summit Entertainment and i still went on to tell him that these were producers for Twillight too and i didn't know they did films like Nick &amp; Norah. then Bella's voice came on, like how the movie trailer went in all the cinemas, then i went 'ohhh its the trailer,' and the trailer went on and on and on and i started wondering why the trailer was going on for so long! and then i realised we were watching Twillight!!!! 
heeheeheeheeheehee i was soooo surprised and happy even though the movie sucked but it was so nice of him! kay if anybody even bothered reading this haha"

"event","HI PPL
i decided to blog proper from now on cus i just read my old blog and i realised i'm not funny anymore. sadness. 
is this what happens when ppl grow older? they lose their sense of humour? thats why we never ever find our parents funny? we think their jokes are corny and they lead sad lives because their sense of humour is so rotten?


i have become so cynical compared to what i used to be back in year 1. i used to blog about my daily activities and have something stupid to say about almost every other thing that happens but now i find it so stupid to blog about daily activities cus i don't think anybody really gives a shit about what happens to me every second of my life. how bitter.

so.
i shall blog like the retard i always.
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA.

HOWS THINGS GOES?
GOODS. THINGS GOES GOODS. ALWAYS.
SOMETIMES BADS. HAVE A GOOD DAYS."

"event","random information about myself that nobody really cares about: 

1) the L button on my keypad is spoilt, it fell out so now im just pressing really hard to get the alphabet out 
2) i had my first flea market experience on saturday, i only earned 25$ which covered rental and i spent another 25$ on a dress. made a loss 
3) the dress was bought from the store beside mine, i told myself not to walk around and spend money. like hell it worked 
4) i regretted buying the dress half an hour later. 
5) i just read some of my older entries and i think i am quite funny. hahahaha 
6) i don't actually know how to use the word 'melancholy' appropriately. 
7) i like to take pi pa gao then take a gulp of cold water. 
8) i like to go '...., haha.' even though things are not funny 
9) when i was younger i use to twist my face to make me look disfigured whenever i walked home after school around a construction site. i was afraid that the workers would rape me. 
10) i hate that hello kitty has no mouth. 
11) im afraid that i would keep changing my kid's name every 2 weeks cus i keep finding new names that i like and wished i had. 
12) i'm going to bake a strawberry chiffon cake soon. wish me luck? 
13) this is an unlucky number, i always believed that if i stopped at this number it'll be bad luck. 
14) this is a romantic number, because of valentines day. 
15) this is..all i have for now. another time haha"

"event","had an awesome weekend. 


The Good, The Bad, The Weird was surprisingly pretty good, the weird guy was very funny, haha. 
spent the weekend with some thoughts constantly going through my mind and i made some resolutions, i'm not gunna put it up openly cus i think it sounds pretty silly hee. 
i'm just so happy and at peace today cus i think this is the best Sunday i've had in weeks, i made sponge cake today! my mom helped me out a lot, cus she hates it when anyone messes up her kitchen and also cus she just can't stand aside and watch me with my amateur stirring and sieving, blablabla hahahahah but the cake was yummy so yay. (:&nbsp; i played guitar hero today for the first time! and i suck, haha owell. the boyf turned out to be pretty awesome so it wasn't very funny. the cousins had a good time laughing their asses off at me though. 

okay i don't know why i'm talking like that i sound like i'm 16 years old all over again i'm sorry i'm just really happy today&nbsp;even though i got a parking ticket of 70$ and i was cursing on my way back to my cousins. i only left the car alone for 5 minutes! i think the guy was lurking around somewhere, like hiding behind a tree and immediately jumping out once i left my car. i'm so upset but nvm at least i didn't get any demerit points and i guess everyone's just trying to make a living so now i'm poor again haha nvm shall stay home and read books and bake more cakes 

i hope everyone else had an awesome weekend&nbsp;(:"

"event","halloween was fantastic, making the effort to go down to the costume shop early was totally worth it cus i swear some of the costumes some ppl wore were really budget or effortlessly dumb. saw 3 or 4 girls wear bandages wrapped around their asses and boobs. i have no idea what they're supposed to be. patients in a hospital who got burned on their breasts and asses maybe? 

you can't really dance in a costume though, but its fun anws, just playing 5-10, haha. 

next year i wanna go as something suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupppppper elaborate, so people will wanna take photos with me and i can be a celebrity for a night. hee"

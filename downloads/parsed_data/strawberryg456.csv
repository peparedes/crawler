my parents just left for rome, and we had a great time in london. i love my family very much, and i am very thankful for how wonderful they are to me. this abroad experience might not be ideal, but it has(and is) giving me the opportunity to see europe!! i am going to amsterdam in two days, then to berlin and edinburgh. Then for winter break i am gunna visit sevilla, madrid, barcelona, rome, florence and venice! i feel so lucky that i am able to travel and that i have a family that supports it. and i also appreciate my home school so much these days. the education is top-notch and the school itself is beautiful. i have great friends, and a boyfriend who i love. as well as a dog i adore. what more could i ask for? i have a wonderful life, and this thanksgiving i might not be home to celebrate.. but i am ever grateful."

"event","i love the song ""danny's song"". ever since i heard my dad and marium singing it at my house the other night, i haven't been able to stop listening to it. it just makes me feel warm and fuzzy, and it reminds me of what love should be.

and it reminds me of what i'm waiting for. i don't doubt that my feelings for bart are at that level, because i love him more than i could have imagined. but i just don't know that he is ready for that kind of love yet. and i'm not secure in his feelings for me. i know he loves me and cares about me, but when i make that decision to spend the rest of my life with someone, i have to know, without any doubt that they love me just as much as i love them. and i have to know that i'm the only one they want.. forever. 

maybe that is a lot to ask for, but i believe that it exists, and therefore, it is what i am waiting for."

i feel like i could say anything to her, and she would just understand it, no matter how sappy or ridiculous or just fucking crazy it is. i can honestly say that there has not been one time in my life where i have resented her, or felt annoyed by her, and that in itself is a miracle. tonight we were talking about past lives and such, and we both agreed that the sense of deja vu comes from our past lives. we also agree that the same (general) people are in your life, every life that you live. And i truly believe that marium and i have lived many lives together. when we are together it is just awesome. i feel like she is the only person that i can really connect with, and it doesn't matter what we do. it is always a great time, and it always brings a smile to my face.

to put it in short words, i am really glad to have her as a friend. i love her :)"

so now drool is coming out my mouth, and i can't feel it because my mouth is numb. and hopefully this won't hurt as badly as it did the first time.

I miss Marcus.. and Gameli. And i miss going to Ultimate practice. I miss the parties. For now, i just wish i was there. 

But looking ahead, London is going to be awesome. Chris and i started packing today. We are going to share clothes when we are over there. But i have a feeling she is weird about her clothes and will be sort of weird about it when we are there. I hope not, bc i don't want any extra drama. I am excited to be going with her though, it makes me not nervous. :) 

We are planning to hardcore diet (i heard the food is gross anyways) and workout over there. So hopefully by the time i come back to Wooster i will be hot. I don't feel hot these days. Probably because i haven't tried to look good in ages. I am lazy in the summertime."

i figured a lot of my europe shit out today. my parents told me the money that i saved this summer, they will double it. so sweet! that allows me to participate in all the weekend excursions AND leaves for some leftover cash.. just in case. i seriously cannot fucking wait.

I've heard of that kind of sick in the movies, but i have never experienced it. So no more painkillers for me. At least not those red ones.

I got my wisdom teeth pulled yesterday morning, and now my jaw (but only the right side) is completely swollen. I look ridiculous. Like another person.. with a fatter face. lol. So therefore life has been kind of boring lately. The day before my surgery i had lunch with Marium and we analyzed our meanings in peoples lives. I love how i can say any thought on my mind, no matter how bizarre it is, and she will understand. Sometimes i feel like we were meant to be friends. And even if we weren't, and theres no such thing as ""meant to be"", i'm glad we are friends, and i hope she stays a part of my life forever :)

After coming back from lunch, i hung out with Chris. We tie-dyed some shirts. I made my peanut shirt look cooler. I'm excited to wear it once back at Wooster. Even though i am a little bit sad that everyone is at school and abroad already, i am not rushing to get back to Wooster. I leave for London on the 16th of September, and i can't wait! :)"

Seville Spain
Barcelona Spain
Rome Italy

However, today i talked to him, and we said that we can see what happens when i come back from London. So for now, we aren't together, but we will keep the possiblity open when i return. This makes me happy, because we do have something special, and i would hate to throw it away when it was so perfect. And it also gives us an opportunity to see what else is out there.. if there is anything better, before we give it another shot. So right now, i couldn't be happier. I leave for London in three weeks with Chris, and when i come back i could still have the love i always wanted. :D"

I understand it is kind of hard for us to be together, but it is not impossible, and if it was something he actually wanted, he would pursue it. I would give up a lot for that boy, and i think i deserve someone who will do the same. I am also worried about getting tested again. A friend of mine just found out that she has Herpes, which scares me because what if i have something like that? FUck. I want to find out, but at the same time, if i did, i would be so upset. So i am kind of avoiding it.

"event","so. i'm kinda stressing out. this summer has been a constant rollercoaster of ups & downs with bart. the distance by itself makes me lose my feelings for him, which i am thankful for, but then other times, when i talk to him, it's back to where i started. i will be the first to admit that this boy has me wrapped around his finger, and it sucks. i have convinced myself that it will all be over when i leave for london. that's 4 and a half months away from the united states. i won't have my cell phone, which means that he can't contact me via text like we are used to. i suppose we could stay in touch over aim, but he's never on. so i dunno, i was hoping that it would be the end when i leave (at least i think it's the best thing for me).. but lately he's been talking about the future. and making many references to ""us"" when i come back. so it's kind of throwing me off, and i hate it. i honestly hate how much i care about bart. i don't want to lose him, and in the perfect world we would be together. however, the world isn't perfect and neither is he. he would only hurt me again, and i don't think i can withstand any more pain.

and i'm terrified bc i feel like it could come any day now. any mention of another girl in his life would just kill me. and i know there are other girls. bc i know him, and i'm not stupid. like for example, i texted him maybe 20 minutes ago, and my only thought due to his lack of response is that he's with another girl. and it's not a great feeling. i really don't want to do this anymore. i want to be with him, but i really can't deal with it. so hopefully florida will be a happy (as can be) ending to our relationship. either that, or he will miracuously change his ways. which won't happen, so i guess i'll have to talk myself into the first plan."

At night, we hung out in her kitchen, drank wine and had deep conversations about our relationships, and our views on life, etc. I can honestly say that it was one of the most fun times i've had this summer. It gave me an idea of what it will be like when we are older, to get together, catch up and share a bottle of wine. Nothing better.

Lately i have been feeling like i want to ""grow up"". It has actually been kind of a strange feeling for me. I love being in college, but I am excited about getting older, establishing a career, getting married, having kids.. etc.
Maybe my maternal instincts are coming through, now that i've entered my twenties. I am often thinking about the future, and what i want.. who i want or don't want in it. I even have come up with the names of my dogs that i will own. (but i blame that on too much time at the kennel).

I have to admit, even though i am excited about the future, i am in no hurry. Except maybe to get to London. Can't fucking wait!! :)

Speaking of London, i might have dug myself into a little hole today. I was talking to Marium on the phone today, and i invited her to come to Europe with me. Although i would want nothing more than her to join Chris and I, i am not sure that chris would be thrilled with the idea. So now i don't really know how to uninvite her. She seems pretty excited about the idea. Fuckkkk. But on the other hand. I'm happy because i just found  out that i got an ""A"" in Statistics! yayyy!!!

"event","i don't know what's wrong with me. i'm just so tired. so drained lately. maybe it's all the work. and all the school. i haven't done anything for me lately. but here's the thing. even when i have time to do stuff ""for me"" i have no desire. i haven't attended ultimate in 3 weeks. i can't remember the last time i went out and did something fun with my time. granted, i can't spend any money. but .. that is still irrelevant. i also will be the first to admit that i have completely neglected all of my friends this summer. it's not that i don't care about them, it's just that i don't appreciate them. And i hate that i don't appreciate them, but i just don't. So maybe deep down, by pushing them away, i will realize how good i have it. and i will feel something. anything. and fight to get them back. i will put up a fight that they deserve. but for now, i just don't care enough. i care, but not enough. 

maybe this feeling is a symptom of depression. but i don't think i have anything to be depressed about. i feel like i'm just drained. like i have no energy left. i think i just don't want to hang out with anyone, because i don't have the energy to entertain them, or keep up with them. they are all so young, and i feel so old. i really don't know what has happened to me, or maybe i have always been like this. I have to admit that i have always felt older than my age. and whenever i do things that people in my age generation do, i feel like i'm forced. for example, keisha wants me to go to bars/clubs.. etc with her. and i dread the day that i have to go. why is that? bars/clubs are  fun. but i just always end up making excuses on why i shouldn't go. i am only young once, so why am i not living it up?

dec 22 fly to paris
christmas afternoon, train down to monte carlo. spend the night. 
26th - hang out in monte carlo, catch a night train to florence.
27, 28 - hang out in florence for two days. 
morning of 29 - train to sienna. spend the day & night in sienna.
morning of 30 - train to rome.

arrive in venice new years night.
spend the 2nd day and night in venice. then the 3rd day, and catch a train back to paris on a overnight.
spend the fourth in paris.
fly out of paris early morning on the 5th of jan.

of course this will change, only a rough draft. but .. so far it looks good to me :)

i'm disappointed because i want to see so much more, but this will have to do. 
i really do think this will be the experience of a lifetime. traveling europe with chris - what more could i ask for??

"event","Cheating takes its toll on relationships. Bart and i have been having a really difficult time ever since he kissed that other girl. We keep fighting over stupid shit, and i feel like i've lost a lot of my feelings for him. I'm not going to lie, before he cheated on me, i was in love with him. He kind of shattered that. I can't love someone i don't trust. This weekend was ridic. Friday night was possibly the most dramatic night of my life. 

Eric came and hung out with Shayna and I on friday. I really do miss having him in my life. He's a good guy, and and we had a heart-to-heart that lasted like 3 hours, no joke. Maybe more? We started out at the Mardi Gras party in Bissman. You can always count on biss to get you wasted.. Eric and i were beer pong partners, and he dominated. i sucked. lol we lost. but he still did well. :) After bissman we headed over to Calcei house. I was pretty drunk at this point, and for the first 2 hours at Calcei house i talked to Eric. He told me everything i ever wanted to hear from him. He told me that he really did like me last year, and that for a while it did come down to Catie vs. Me. I just needed to know that i was important to him, and he confirmed that for me. He also made me feel better about Bart cheating on me, because he just listened to me talk about it for a while. He gave me advice, and consoled me.. and i really appreciated that. Bart sort of gave me permission to even the score that night, and i thought about kissing Eric, but Shayna kind of ruined that. lol. She told him my plan for the night (that i was thinking about kissing another boy).. so then Eric was like ""no, that's a bad idea. if you need me, you can call me and i will cuddle with you, and hold you.. but i don't want to hook up with you"" That made me appreciate him even more. 

After talking to Eric, i went off to find Gameli. He lives in Calcei house, and i wanted to see what he was up to. He was upstairs in his room chillin, so i went up there. We talked for a bit, and eventually we went downstairs.. i sat on this chair in the corner, and he sat on my lap.. and he kissed me. I wasn't planning on evening the score with Gameli. Because i know there are feelings behind that, and i didn't want to cause any drama. But he kissed me. I sort of kissed him back, but not really. I told him i was still with Bart, and he got really upset. He doesn't understand why i am with him, and honestly? i don't either. He asked me if we could go upstairs to talk so we did. He told me that he really likes me and i explained to him all of my apprehensions. I talked to him about my insecurities with bart, and that if i had known that he (gameli) liked me in the begininng things may have been different. But i was with bart, and shit was just fucking complicated. He definitely doesn't want to get involved in all the drama, but he confronted the rumors that i told him that i'd heard about him. I heard he was a bit of a slut, and he was like ""i don't have to explain myself to you, but i'm going to just because i wnat you to know"" and he told me that he's only slept with 3 ppl since he's been at Wooster. He might be a little bit of a flirt, but it takes a lot for him to like someone, and i'm the first girl at wooster that he's liked in a long time. This broke my heart. We got kicked out of the room, so we resumed this conversation downstairs int he hallway. He held my hand. It was really sweet, and he told me a bunch of other stuff like ""you're the only girl i can talk to for hours on end and never be bored"".. and i feel the same way. At this point i was just like fuck bart. he treats me like shit (because he does..).. so when he called to tell me that he was headed down to calcei house.. i freaked out. I just went upstairs and started crying. Eventually i just left.. but then decided to come back. Bart is my boyfriend, and i needed to see him. When i walked into Oren's room, where he was.. he was so happy to see me. And this killed me. I felt so guilty. I didn't know what to do. So then i asked bart if it really was going to be over in 2 weeks, and he said yes. So.. then i get pissy but i hang around for a bit longer, and rhion is talking to us.. and barts like ""where is gameli?"" and shes' like ""he's up in his room moping"". OMG. killll me. so  then i leave, but then come back again. Make bart meet me outside. and i was like ""either we are going to break up now, or we are going to break up in may. Take your choice."" He told me he was feeling pressured and he couldn't maket hat decision. So i told him he just gave me my answer, and that it was over. I met up wiht shayna and we both were just bawling. It was ridiculous actually. I texted Gameli and told him ""i broke up with bart, so do what you want with that"". He called me 10 minutes later to tell me that he was coming over, but then called back to say that we should just call it a night and talk tomorrow. I was glad, because I didn't want to make any rash decisions.

That night, after gameli dind't come.. i texted bart bc i was so upset and i told him ""i just want you to know that i love you and that i'm sorry if this hurt you, but i just can't do this to myself"". He asked me to come over, please. So i did. I went over there, and we held each other for a while. He told me that he loves me too. (he's already told me before that he loves me, and that was the first time i've ever told anyone that i've loved them). He made me cry at the end of the night, because he told met hat he wanted to dance with other girls, and it's just not going to last until may. So i left for the night. I cried.. and in the morning i wanted to talk to him again because i needed to know if we were really over, or if we were still doing the sb thing.. (i'm pathetic). He was sick with a fever when i went over there, so i took care of him. He got better when i was there, and he kept calling me his angel. it was really cute. We decided to stick it out until spring break again, and we're going to see what happens afterwards. In all honesty, i don't know how i feel about him anymore. I do love him, and care about him immensely, but.. the zsa zsa zu just isn't there anymore. He can't make me feel happy and giddy the way that he used to be able to. He's just hurt me too many times. So maybe things will be better if it's over after spring break. I know i will be devastated, but i have to admit that Gameli is willing to give me everything that i want from bart. So why do i still want bart?. 

But until then, i'm looking forward to high tide. :)"

chris was supposed to come visit me, but she missed her flight.

bart cheated on me, and now i'm completely confused as to what to do. we made the decision to stick it out until spring break, but i don't know if i can do that. we're supposed to have a regular fuck date in 10 minutes, but i think i might start crying or something. eh. let's see how strong i am. maybe i can get over it.

but i won't lie. i secretly want bart to cherish these last few weeks and then realize at the end of it that he doesn't want to lose me. but i know that's not going to happen. nothing ever relaly goes the way i want it to.

"event","ultimate practice last night was amazing, i really am starting to love that game. I think the only problem that i had before was lack of encouragement. But now with Bart and Amy.. they're making me feel more confident, and therefore i enjoy playing more. I think i'm playing better too. :) so yay! After ultimate i ran into bart on the way to the library, and this made me happy because he was acting affectionate in public. Granted no one was around, but he hasn't kissed me outside since last year. So :)  Then i headed to the library, got a lil work done.. ran into Gameli. I was worried things would be a little awkward, but they aren't, so that made me happy.. but sad at the same time.. because i guess before i told him about Bart, there was this flirtation thing going on that.. was a possibility (not that i would have acted on it.. i don't believe in cheating).. but it was fun to pretend sometimes. I know that sounds horrible, but its not like my feelings for Gameli aren't genuine. They are. And sometimes i wonder what it would be like if i wasn't with bart. But i am. so i shouldn't think about that. When i was leaving the library, i called bart, because he told me to call him when i was done. He answered the phone and told me that he was playing drinking games with his hallmates.. so i was like ""okay.. well i guess i'll talk to you tomorrow...?"" and he's like ""okay bye"".  Um. i was pissed. and genuinely upset. i started questioning our whole relationship.. bc he's done this kind of thing before. And then i felt like it was only fair to let him know that i was mad.. so i sent him a text saying ""i don't htink you realize how insensitive you can be sometimes"". and.. after a bunch of shit.. i ended up going over there and everything was good again. :) i really do like him, and i want this to work. 

I am a little worried though, because tomorrow is Valentine's day. I'm concerned that he's not going to do anything for me. While i like to think that i'm not one of those ppl that is sucked in by hallmark and everything else.. i am a romantic person, and i would be hurt if he didn't do anything. So shit. i guess we'll find out what happens. Tonight there is a shitload of snow on the ground, so we're (the school) going to fill up the kauke arch wtih snow.. it's a tradition in hopes that class will be cancelled. but eh. i doubt it'll actually happen. However, it'll be fun to try :)"

"event","it's monday night, and i'm killing sometime before ultimate practice, so i figured i'd spill about my wonderful weekend. Friday I went ice skating with Michelle and Shayna. It was really cute, and i definitley think that the ice skating rink is by far the coolest thing Wooster has done. Friday night I went and played indoor ultimate in Cleveland. I was actually really worried about going, because Bart was going.. and i didn't want him to judge me for not being good at Ultimate. Amy made my fears even worse on the car ride up, when she was talking about how Bart made her cry one time because she fucked up a play or something. However, once we got there and started playing, things got a lot better. I had a great time playing with the boys team, and watching Bart out there was really fun too.. since i've never REALLY seen him play. With the exception of that one time. With an assist from Bart, i scored a goal.. the first time i went in. :) yay. Amy and Z were like super pumped that Shayna and I were playing well, and i appreciated her enthusiasm. It has definitely made me more excited about playing ultimate. After we won both games, we headed back to Wooster. On our way back Amy kept talking to me about Bart. I felt a little weird, but once i realized she was just trying to help.. i appreciated it. She told me lots of things about him, most of which i already knew. But the cutest thing she said was that he always got a huge grin on his face whenever i made a good play, and that one time he even said ""that's my girl!"" :) aw. i really like him. she was like ""i can tell by watching him on the sidelines that he's crazy about you"". so... sweet. lol. Once we got back to campus i hung out in the room for a bit, and then Bart called me and i slept over there. He was really sweet about me playing.. and i was flattered when he said the only thing i need for ultimate is time. more experience. But other than that, i'm good to go, and i didn't do anything in particular wrong. That's a HUGE compliment coming from Bart, and i was happy to hear him say that. 

Saturday morning I woke up and got breakfast with Bart. Afterwards I just kind of sat around all day.. and Gala was at night. I was excited because Bart said he'd go.. and i definitely didn't think that he was going to. Once the night started, shayna and i got ready.. and headed over to Cory, Christine & Becca's room for a pregame. Then headed to Gala. Once i got there it was fun.. but after a while i realized that it was kind of lame. Bart showed up a lil after i did, and immediately came and found me. :) he was looking hot, as usual. I love boys all dressed up.. what can i say? Bart and i went to dance, but then he got all weird on me, and i felt weird.. and i felt like he didn't want to hang out with me.. so i just kind of left to find shayna and her boytoy. I found them.. and then Gameli came up to me.. and :) we went off and talked for a bit. Bart saw and got kind of pissy about it.. but whatever. When Gameli and i were talking, i told him that Bart was my boyfriend.. and he seemed really upset about it. He told me that he was planning on asking me to be his date to gala, and that he likes me. I felt horrible. I mean, i do like Gameli, i won't lie, but i'm not sure how much, and I know i like Bart more...a lot more. It's just a shitty situation to be in, because sometimes i feel like Bart doesn't like me, and maybe i would be better off with someone else. After Gameli and i finished talking, I went back to Bart, who was superpissed/fucked up. We didn't stay at gala for much longer.. and there were no afterparties really.. so we went back to his room and passed out, basically. I was kind of upset, but whatever. it happens.

Sunday morning, woke up with Bart.. went to breakfast with kyle, bart and shayna. Nothing too exciting. Sat around the dorm all day.. did hw, ordered pizza.. you know. just chilled. 

.. and that was my wonderful weekend.

Today is monday, and i accidentally slept through my 8am latin class. i felt horrible about it.. and i also slept through my 9am session with bart, which i felt even more horrible about. But i made it to my 10am soc class. yay. After soc, i killed time for a while until lunch with michelle at 1 and my gyno appt at 2:15. After the appt, michelle and i watched this really bizarre but interesting movie called ""six degrees of separation"".. and then went to walmart. Vday is coming up.. and i'm kind of stressing about what to do for bart. what are we supposed to do for boys on vday anyways?
 

eh i dunno. we'll see how that one goes. 

and now, i'm headed to ultimate. peace."

Sororities are actually kind of shit. I mean, sometimes i enjoy being in one.. but basically i just think pledging is completely unnecessary and retarded. I personally don't like to see people cry. but that's just me.

Last night, overall was pretty fun. but there was one thing in particular that kind of killed the entire night. i don't know how to feel about it. obviously, i'm upset. but am i being unrealistic? is it unrealistic to hope that maybe someone can just be faithful to me? okay, so maybe he didn't cheat on me, but he was pretty damn close. and right in front of my face, too. it was just really disrespectful.. and not to mention uncomfortable. i just don't know how to feel. i'm not as upset as i would have thought i'd be.. but that's because i've expected this the whole time. once a slut, always a slut. right?

why is my life always so dramatic? i just want to escape the drama for once.. maybe i should just turn lesbian. but then again, girls are super dramatic. so maybe i should just be asexual. yeah. i think i'm gunna try that out."

"event","when looking back on last semester, i remember it all dark and depressing. i think that is because i had a hard time adjusting from freshman year. things were so different. my classes were horrible and my love life was also kind of depressing last semester. just nothing really seemed to be going my way. i had higher hopes for this semester, and so far so good, but i guess i'm just being paranoid. sometimes i wonder if i could be happier at another school. i doubt i'll ever find out though. i think i'm going to stick around wooster for all 4 years.

so last night was the first wooster wednesday of the year. yayy. i had to attend a mandatory hazing meeting, and then immediately afterwards i went over to the peanut hall for a meeting with them. it's hard to believe that i went through pledge week a year ago.. it doesn't seem like that long. and i have mixed feelings about the upcoming pledge week. i feel like some of the stuff we do is unnecessary and just draining. but i guess i'll have a real opinion on the matter after the next two weeks. after the pi kappa meeting, i went to hang outwith some girls on the frisbee team for a bit.. but i dunno i don't really feel like i fit in with them sometimes. well most of the time, actually. i think it's actually a group thing. i don't like big groups, i usually feel intimidated. but anyways. after hanging out there for a bit, i had to head back to the hall for some more sorority stuff. and in the process i got pretty trashed. i hung out on the hall for the majority of the night, and then went to armington to finish the night off. let's just say i was fuckeeeddddd up by the time the clock struck 12, and i was home in kenard by 1. bart came back at 2:30, and i slept over there. :) 

this morning i woke up, and bart had a meeting to go to, so i went back to my room, and slept some more. can we say hangover?? then i went to my africana studies class at 2:30.. i love that class. i really like the africana studies subject. maybe i'll minor?? but yeah, after class bart and i went to lowry to get some food. and then i went back to kenarden and sat around for a while until ultimate practice at 9. it's a pretty goood workout this semester, and that makes me happy. who knows, maybe i'll end up getting my ass back into shape. i hope? 

but yeah, i got nothing else."

when i got home, i watched ""an inconvienent truth"". the facts of that movie were horrifying. this world really needs to make a significant change - and fast. if not, the human race is in serious danger. hopefully people will wake up and see the light.. until then, i decided that i will do everything i can to be more environmentally conscious.

so bart texted me today and told me that his parents loved my thank you letter (from going to visit).. and that they put it on the fridge. i think that's hilarious.. but also cute. :) he also told me that ""our song is playing on the radio"". this made me happy, bc i didn't even know we had a song.. and it's cute that he took the initiative to give us one. the song is called golden girls by the damnwells. it was the song playing on the radio when we drove back to the airport.. leaving louisville on monday night. :) good song.

tonight i hung out with chris for a while, and then went over to marium's house. her mom is going through breast cancer right now, and it's really hard to see her. she has lost all of her hair, and is in tremendous pain. i hate seeing her like this, but the worst is over. i hope. other than that though, the visit to see marium was quite enjoyable. i miss hanging out with her, and i'm disappointed in myself for sort of dropping the ball as her friend this break. i will do better next time, i promise. because i really do love her. :)

anyways, i'm headed back to school tomorrow. i have mixed feelings about it. i'm excited to see my friends again.. but i'm kind of scared at the same time. i don't want to get back into the school work.. and i'm afraid of where this bart thing is going to go. but i guess we can only find out.

"event","i had the weirdest dream last night. I normally do not remember my dreams with such vivid detail, but last night i did. Here's what happened.

The last thing i remember was getting the news that my cousin, Jackson, died. I remember talking to my aunt and my mom about it, contemplating if it could really be true. And we in the end, decided that it was. But then, i went to this library study desk, that 4 people can share.. and jackson was there and he made room for me, and introduced me to his two other friends. (random?). so i dunno.. then i went to school, which was really the mariott. and i went to the grocery store (which kinda was the mariott). Everyone from high school and a few people from college were there. everyone was really sad, becausee they were all talking about how Matt Alhanti died. (him and my cousin were kind of the same person, i guess??). So then, i'm walking around.. and i think i see Bart. And i like do a double take.. and sure enough it was him.. so i start running in the other direction, so he doesn't see me. But i think he does anyways. I'm like running along the toher ends of the isles to spy on him, but he was out the door before i could say anything to him. So then, i run into Vicki, and she asks me what i'm doing. I tell her who bart is, and she's like ohh, i want to seee him. So we go outside and look around the corner and we see him sitting in front of Kenarden. Then Angel, or Michelle? comes out and we all 3 start talking about Matt Alhanti. Meanwhile, i look up, and i see Bart motioning for me to come over. So i go over there, and i'm talking to him.. he's like you look good.. blah blah.. and he's like man i really need to go brush my teeth so i can kiss you, and then he tried to kiss me anyways.. and i was like dude my breath tastes like macaroni and he;s like mine too! (dude, i know.. whatever?) and then michelle comes over and is talking about our skit (i'm apparently an eko), and how i need a date, and she talks to bart, and she's like ""your kara's date to formal"" and i had teh dress in my hands.. and he's like wow, you look so good, like half of a ten seriously. then michelle freakso ut, and is like half of a ten!? kara deserves so much more than that. she would have said you were like a 32 out of 10. so that means you should say she's a 50 out of ten, and she grabs my hand and takes me away. So then, i'm kinda upset, and so i go for a drive, and tell michelle i'll be back in time for the skit. so i go for a drive, and when i'm coming back, im is sthe exit for our hotel/grocery store. so then i get off at the next exit, an di have to pay this guy 26 dollars on my mom's c redit card to take me down a rolley cart to my hotel. so i get there, and we perform the skit.. and it was weird, bc i was a memeber of eko, i was a stand in or something. and i kept looking to see if bart was watching.. and he was. and then i woke up. 

okay.. what the fuck?? why bart? and why was everyone liike dying?  i don't get it. at all. my dreams never make sense."

since i've been back the drama has already started. yesterday i went to the mall with chris and nicky, and on the carride home nicky blew up at me for ""disrespecting her family"". i just said that her dad scares me, because he does. There is a lot more behind it, that nicky doesn't even know about, so i don't think that i don't have a right to feel the way i do. Maybe i shouldn't have said anything, but some of the stuff nicky said was completely uncalled for. God, i didn't even know what to say to her, because i was really offended by how she was acting. Whatever. 

At night i hung out with Marium, and she helped me sort out my feelings and we talked about everything. I told her some stuff that she never knew about me, and the same to me.

"event","it's funny because people think i'm such a strong person. Even my best friend thinks that the only time i've ever cried was during a movie. The truth is, i just can't cry in front of anyone. I can't show them how vunerable i really am. I guess i feel like there's no way i can cry because if i did cry, i would cry all the time. The truth is, the littlest things effect me and sometimes that feeling is so powerful that it scares the shit out of me. I mean, i dated this guy for like a month one time, and after he broke up with me.. i was depressed for about a year afterwards. That's not normal. I'm not depressed. That's not the problem.. the problem is i'm just very vunerable. I've never been in a serious relationship because i've been too afraid that it would kill me if it ended. I'm scared of what will happen to me if i'm hurt that badly. When my grandmother died, i was sad, but i still haven't really accepted the fact that she's gone. If i accept it, then i'll be devastated and i don't want to be sad. I don't know.. maybe i just need to cry and to let it all out, but i don't even know how. 

Tonight i was watching a movie, and i realized that my dog couldn't get up. My dad was in the room, so i just laughed it off. The truth is, i wanted to cry, but i couldnt' cry with him in the room so i had to laugh as an alternative. He asked me why i was laughing,, and that's horrible. My own dad thinks i'm incapable of feeling anything, when really it's the other way around. Right after he left the room i started crying, and then maybe a couple of minutes later, my mom came in and saw me. I told her that it was mainly because of the movie. I don't know why i told her that. I'm fucking pissed at myself. What kind of person can't express sadness?

What is wrong with me?"

"event","it was weird. tonight i went out and played sports in our cul-de-sac. just the way we used to. only everythign is different now, for everyone's so grown up.. and most of the people that were there before are gone now. kinda sad actually. but hey, it was still a good time. i suck at baseball, but frisbee was fun :)

earlier in the day i just went to work, then went to the pool with chris & nicky. then, worked out for a bit.. which was really refreshing. showered, went out for coldstone (kinda dumb eh?), then chilled. a good summer day in my opinion. but that's just my opinion."

"event","i dunno. this summer is kind of boring me. i'm looking forward to going back to wooster. that scares me though, because what is going to happen when i graduate. I can't be so dependent on this school for happiness. 

eh, but if i think about it, i think it's just excitement, it's not like i depend on it or anything. A fresh semester with a new roomie, new dorm, new boy, new friends, new sorority, will be super nice :)

work is alright. i don't like the hours.. at all. but hey, it's money.

i just want to be rich though.

--

life's been good though. for the most part. i can't complain too much. just been layin low, sleeping, working, chillen with friends.

it's been quite nice.

but, i just hope it goes by a little faster.
because the faster it goes by, the sooner i can go to school."

um. i've been getting fucked up a lot lately. it's ridiculous. i guess it's all the stress of finals week. I'M done now tho! thank fucking god.

"event","so let me tell you about my wonderful weekend :)

friday i learned to tango with lucy. it was slightly awkward bc meghan meeker was there (my ex bf - sort of, kind of cheated on me with her - sort of). but yeah other than that, it was really fun.

after learning to tango, i took a quick shower before heading over to marcus' room. we chilled there for a bit, and then headed to bornhuetter for a party that gameli and bakar invited me to. 

they got me pretty drunk, and i actually started thinking that i had a crush on gameli at that point, but then later thought better of it. he's an awesome guy though, and i wish we could become better friends. 

after bornhuetter, we went to pi kappa for a bit, then to the ug. at the ug i ran into bart. lol slightly awkward at first, but not really bc he's hot as fuck.

so yeah, he invited lucy and i back to the hyder apartments, and we all chilled there with the frisbee team. after a while i left with bart, and we went to the playground, and then back to his room. lol it's not as bad as it seems. it was a fun time. he's a fun guy to hang out with.

it was cute though, bc he gave me his sweatshirt and walked me abck to my room. :) 

i love boys. 


- 

saturday i woke up, went to a tea party. it was really cute, afterwards we played apples 2 apples.  then i came back, took a nap.. went to dinner, then to sams... smoked a bit, then went to lumberjack.. drank a bit... went to country kitchen.. ate a bit... and last came back to compton and hung out with bart.. :) 

and now, i'm going to sleep.

good night."

well, at least i'm finished with the hell part of the week.

i had a psych test on monday, a presentation on tuesday, and a paper due on wednesday. talk about stressful. geez..

but yeah, i broke up with alex.. and he kind of went psycho violent on me. 

so, needless to say, i'm never talking to him again.

"event","i've made some decisions lately that have made me ashamed of myself. I've realized lately that i'm very selfish. I never thought that i was, but i did the worst thing that i could have done to this kid. I feel really bad, and i only hope that i can learn from this experience and make myself a better person.

i have a fear of commitment, or at least i haven't found that right person yet. And i know now that when someone has a fear of commitment, it means that they haven't fully matured yet. I have no idea what love is, and i don't pretend to. but i know that i have so much to learn before i can truely love someone. i have a lot of issues that i have to sort out, and once i am able to that, i can only hope to find someone that will love me as much as this kid does. 

he's a great guy, and i hope that he finds someone to make him happy. bc he deserves that - he really does."

"event","Only 3 more weeks or so until summer break. I'm honestly very excited to get out of here. Although i will miss my friends, i want to spend time with my Georgia friends bc it's been way too long. I'm also tired of school. It's completely exhausting, and i need a break.

Things are a bit different in the guy situation now.. I'm kind of dating Alex. Yeah, i know right? Whatever. I missed him, and i wanted him back in my life. Bc i couldn't STAND not talking to him. That was driving me crazy. The only problem is, i don't know how much i like him. I know i care about him, and i want him in my life.. but not necessarily as a boyfriend. And it's scaring me bc he's so serious about it all. He even told me that he loves me ?! ah. I feel like i'm getting myself into some deep shit with all this. And i don't want to break his heart, but if he continues at this pace, he's only going to chase me away.

Yeah i know, so what happened to Eric, you might ask. Well. He's still around, but something happened recently that just made it so that we can absolutely not hook up anymore. And it's funny, bc him and catie are done forever now.

I guess the main thing about eric is that i don't like him anymore. I don't like alex either though. shit. fuck. god damn it.

sometimes being single is the best thing.. for serious.

... so yeah. i'm totally procrasinating on my work, and i should really get back to it...

but.. one last thing; i'm totally psyched for lip sync tonight!!! :)"

"event","today was a pretty good day. 

i met a lot of new people/hung out with people i don't really hang out with. it made me realize that even though i love shayna, michelle & lucy.. i need more friends than just them. well, actually i've known this for a while, but today was the first time i realized that it was actually possible.

oren did tell me that alot of people judge me for my 'speech impediment' but fuck that shit. that's lame, and the people that will accept me despite that, are the ones that i actually want as my friend.

so today has made me so grateful for those who i already have (i love you!) and those who have yet to come.

"event","everythings going well right now. i'm a little stressed about school, but nothing serious. just the typical wooster shit. in general, however, i'm pretty happy these days. nothing has been getting  me down (aka boys). lol, sometimes it's good to live a life without crushes and all that nonsense..

bc if you think about it, boys are like drugs. having a crush is like the high, it's great, but it only lasts so long, before something goes wrong with it.. and then you're experiencing the ""down"" side of it. and then, in order to recover, you have to find a new ""high"". it's a bitch.

therefore, it's good to be free - clean - whatever you want to call it.

"event","I just got back from taking a communications exam, and i think it went pretty well. so i'm pretty psyched about that. 

i'm also pretty psyched, because i think i have finally figured out what i want to do with my life. once you figure this out, life sort of begins to have meaning. like you have a purpose and direction, and something to strive for. 

i'm definitely going to major in psychology. i'm really interested in learning about all the concepts behind that major. I might also consider a minor in sociology or urban studies. we'll see. but as long as i have some sort of idea, life is much easier.

last night i was talking to lucy and shayna, and they both agreed that i would make a good marriage counselor. i actually am kind of interested in that idea. it would be something that i would enjoy doing. so who knows?! maybe..

anyways. life is just normal right now pretty much. i'm finally not so dependent on boys to make me happy right now, which is a good thing. i'm just focusing on school, and getting the best experience that i can from this school. because, even though i might complain about it sometimes, i cant deny that it's a good education. 

other than that - my birthday is thursday. i'll be 19. it's so hard to believe how fast i've grown."

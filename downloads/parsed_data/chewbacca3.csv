"event","Girls and food, they r like drugs because they contain or posses the same properties/symptoms.The reason  say that is because if u look at what ur body requires or does before and after drugs.

Food is like drugs because wen u r small or a young child ur body only uses wat it needs or in other words requires a certain amount of food and as u get older ur body requires more and more 2 give ur body all the energy it needs and 4 all the other things ur body needs food 4.Now drugs r the same because wen u 1st start off u can only take wat ur body can handle and as u get older or use it more ur body will require or will b able 2 sustain more.

Girls r like drugs because wen u r small girls and kissing r the worst things imaginable until u get older and u start finding the opposite sex rather attractive and u start wondering, 1 kiss thats all that should b fine and wen u get that kiss u start craving it more and more as the days go on.This is like drugs because in the beginning drugs r the worst thing imaginable yet wen people try it the find it 2 b quite good and they start craving it more and more.

"event","Life is strange, because wen u go to school u r in a way to get or make friends, and wen u make friends u always want to spend time and have fun with them.The thing is in the end all u have is family because during school friends come and go wen u finish matrick u go ur seperate ways, the same aplies with girlfriends and boyfriends, they come and go but family will always b there 2 comfort and support u wen u need them, girlfriends, boyfriends and friends can only do so much.So remember its good to have friends but its better 2 have a loving family and u must never put anything or anyone above ur family because in the end family is all u have."

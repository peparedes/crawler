Originally, this blog was born out of a class about blogging. Now this blog is being reborn out of a class; an independent study that is seemingly constantly evolving, but always interesting.In essence, this blog will serve as notes on my independent study of Rust Belt Cities and their web presence, including but not limited to:
-Official City Webpages
-Development Blogs (Both official and unofficial)
-Virtual Museums of City History (Do they exist for Rust Belt Cities? Are they any good?)
In the end, this blog may or may not become a virtual museum of the History of Milwaukee. I may build a virtual museum somewhere else. For an idea of what I'm looking at, <lj-cut text=""Click This Link Than Click These Links"">

"event","It's a nice day outside. Go out and explore Milwaukee on your own. 

As for me and this blog...things might slow down. Midterms are sort of over, but projects continue to be piled on me for school.

Instead I'm going to just rant a bit.

I busted up on my generation a bit back about not having enough civic pride. I'll still stand by it though, civic pride is lost.

But there's some of us (myself included) who would like to stay in this city through thick and thin. Right now obviously we're kinda thin, but I don't think I'd call us skinny.

We're ""trim."" Milwaukee's in a sweet spot right now. Not for publicly funded projects (as we found out that our nationally known <a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/watch/?watch=1&date=3/26/2007&id=21078"">housing program is in trouble</a>) but we've got a few local corporations doing good.

Local corporations are something that Milwaukee has depended upon while we are in our downs. Look around town, look at all those things called ""corporate sponsorships."" They've been around for a while in our city. It's nothing new to Milwaukee.

But I've already gone off track.

I think that the generation before us (I'd call them yuppies...those professionals who live in their rich condos downtown and along the lake...while I'm driving my $200 car around them and taking pictures) won't stay. They know what they want and they won't stay in a city if it doesn't offer it. City residents vote with their feet, they'll move if they want to.

However (and maybe I'm just full of bright-eyed college urban planning/geography/studies optimism) I think we'll be the generation to fix the cities. We've seen the <a href=""http://www.ci.detroit.mi.us/default.htm"">wrong way</a> <a href=""http://www.gary.in.us/"">to fix</a> <a href=""http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/index.html?CFID=757610&CFTOKEN=1f494e66f3b3406a-8F7D7397-F1AB-D188-5C74A2D58CD21C23""> a city</a> and we've got new ideas. Ideas that will fix the city.

I don't want to see anyone do this in the next few years to my city on a blog:

<span style=""font-style:italic;""><a href=""http://www.ci.mil.wi.us/"">We've seen the wrong way to fix a city...</a></span>

Rant two:

Right now we can pretty much call public transit in Milwaukee dead. Scotty Walker and his men continue to cut away at our bus service, but don't do much else to help it. Okay, so they did propose more freeway lanes...

Mayor Barrett has proposed his <a href=""http://www.mkedcd.org/ebulletin/transit/"">idea</a> which I actually like the best right now. I'd like to see the current bus system stay (and update the buses) with something like Mayor Barrett's idea. People would use this system because it actually goes some place. Take people to they're jobs and where they want to go? What a novel idea.

Pluses I see with COMET at a first glance
-Somebody actually bothered to see where development is happening, where it has happened, and where it can happen because of transit. Transit that spurs development is something that Milwaukee needs.
-It goes somewhere. It doesn't just loop around downtown and make people drive to park to get on a trolley to walk 4 to 7 blocks (which isn't that hard, 4 to 7 urban blocks isn't much. The commute in the late 1800s and early 1900s in Milwaukee involved the factory worker walking a half an hour to an hour from home to work and back again after a 12ish hour day) it actually connects parts of the city to other parts of the city
-It doesn't require retrofitting (or re-retrofitting) our streets for rail-based transit.

I'm liking it right now, but this debate over transit isn't going to be over anytime soon and isn't going to be liked by everybody.

I'd rather take the bus then drive my $200 car around town.

If the county gave up ownership a few weeks back, does that mean they can actually tell me not to trespass? And why is ""No Trespassing"" in lower case letters? Is it only a suggestion?  

<img src=""http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a69/skinnypetermurbanex/OldCoastGuardStation/24r.jpg""/>

The Old Coast Guard Station is slowly committing suicide and throwing itself into the Lake. What will Milwaukee do?

For now, all other plans have fallen through and are dead in the water.

That's quite a wonderful little bridge there, although I don't think I'd trust it anymore. This is facing out over the lake, by the way. The rescue boats would sit underneath this bridge.

This is the article that sort of lead to my rant about the whole Milwaukee vs Chicago and civic pride thing. Milwaukee's skyline from the lake isn't much. Our downtown was founded along the Milwaukee river, and the skyline views from other directions are more stunning. But those condo towers that rise along the bluff as of late (Late meaning after oh say 1980 whatnot) are really making things look good. Especially good are our two towers rising next to each other that this article talks about. Not only that, but Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (SOM) are big BIG names in the architecture business. Having two of their towers in our city is wonderful.

Turning to some sad news now...
<a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=573278"">Historic Station May Be Razed</a>

Thats right folks. Once again the old Coast Guard Station is in peril. It's had an interesting history since it's been abandoned. Taken over by the Indian School the same summer Alcatraz was taken over and other such things. It's a cute little building, sort of our own little piece of the Mediterranean. I was hoping that it could be saved after they built the Bay Street Pedestrian bridge and make it into a little park or park pavilion. A jazz club. Something.

But tearing her down. Well, she's been the victim of arson and vandalism (the rape and murder of buildings) especially in the past year. I guess it's time to say good bye.

Building a replica like they discuss, I don't know if I can buy that. I think they should push for the extra million to do it. Replicas are just that, replicas. The authenticity is lost and it seems cheesy.

And now she's in nobody's hands. The bulldozers and wreaking ball could come any day now. (Note to self, picture opportunity number one).

Well, thats the news. I'm going to read up on Barrett's transit plan, especially for downtown. I used to think that Barrett was kind of a do nothing mayor, especially filling the shoes of Norquist, but now he's showing his true colors. Don't let the county shut you down Barret. Scott Walker is a phony. He won't save the county at all."

I brought along my camera, but as usual, I chickened out. (The pictures on the website don't do justice to the glorious beauty that's inside). I totally had permission to take as many pictures as I wanted, but I didn't. I have this thing where I can't take pictures of the inside of a church. I feel guilty. I don't attend the church, but I feel that I'm stealing something from the people that do attend the church. It's weird, I know.

Hopefully though I'll get over that fear. Everybody should go check that out, it's a $3 tour. Tour as in self-guided. Well, a tour guide who tells you about things.

Totally worth it."

"event","Since when did that become the cool opinion, especially around town. You live here for goodness sakes. Civic pride anyone? It seems to be dead in Milwaukee, especially among young people.

Now yes, I am a young person, a college aged kid, but I've got civic pride. Is it lost on our generation? It seems that way sometimes.

What's the big thing to do as of late? Take the Greyhound down to Chicago. Admire Chicago. Wish Milwaukee was Chicago.

Milwaukee isn't Chicago. Milwaukee will never be Chicago.

And that's fine with me. I really think it should be fine with everybody.

The problem is, it isn't. Young people vote with their feet meaning if they don't like where they live, they will leave. Why do you think Portland, Oregon is yuppiefied now? There wasn't much in Portland, except it attracted the younger crowd with good urban planning policies and other urban issues the younger generation cares about. They might not realize it, but they do care about urban issues?

Now what has Milwaukee been doing wrong? I'm not sure. Every time we try to be ahead of the curve, we either fail at being ahead of the curve somehow, or it gets shot down by the powers that be.

What makes Milwaukee projects fail? We have them, we have lots of them. We do them by the book.

I think the problem is that Milwaukee only does things by the book, things that can be found in other cities. So why choose Milwaukee for that thing? When Milwaukee does want to do something new and beautiful and ahead of the curve...it gets shot down by the powers that be.

I still love this city though. I have pride in my city. I love where I live. I want to make things better. It's hard though.

Milwaukee is shedding it's rust belt industrial past, but apparently not fast enough for some people.

It's not cool to hate on Milwaukee."

I've got to get out more...these are becoming a stretch!

But think about it, there aren't many other cities that save buildings like these. In other cities, Sydney Hih and many other buildings, would have come down. Sometimes buildings do need to come down, but I admire local preservationists and developers using what they can use.

<lj-cut text=""Green on the Gothic Revival Church""/>

<a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=558230""/> Pastor's Green Ideas Could Renew Gothic Revival Church </a>

Normally, I'm not a big fan of Whitney Gould's commentary. Sometimes we agree, other times we don't. However, she got this one spot on.

Do you think the German's and the Gothic Revivalists could have imagined that they're distinctly sloped roofs could be the source for solar panels that create heat? I doubt it. Think about how many churches could do this. Vernacular church architecture itself calls for steep roofs. If this pastor does everything he says he does, this might be one of the first green congregations.

Probably the first Gothic Revival building with solar heat at least.

"event","Alright, so I guess maybe I'm just a little too picky-choosy with news stories to share and comment on. I don't normally have time to look through the print version of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, but I do have time to browse through their online section. (Wait, abandoning print material for online material, what?) But anyways, this little story caught my interest.

<a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=555484""/> More Growth In The Valley </a>

This story caught my interest because it's one of my favorite topics to talk about. Milwaukee's Menomonee Valley shedding its old dirty industrial past for a new face of...less dirty industrial future...AND PARKS WITH SMOKE STACKS IN THEM!

What can I say, park with smoke stacks, it's totally a selling point in the redevelopment market these days.

But onto the article. The article talks about some of the most obvious buildings in the Menomonee Valley, The old Milwaukee Gas Light Company buildings. This article calls them the 1895 buildings. Fitting as that's when they were built and designed by one of my favorite Milwaukee architects, Alexander Eschweiler.

It's good to see the buildings back in use. They've been in use for a while now, but I remember back to being a kid and driving along I-94 with my parents, these buildings didn't look so good. They've been cleaned up and put back into use, but they've still got a good chunk of empty space.

This design proposal does sound good. We've got

-Renovation (Always a plus)
-Two new buildings (They'd better fit in or look good at not doing it. Bland development=bad development)
-Possible tenants (People in buildings is always a good idea)
-Open space, riverwalk (Riverwalk is a hot term in Milwaukee and in other cities)

I still see a problem though, getting people down there to enjoy this ""Campus like setting."" I mean visibility yes, but navigating the old industrial streets of the Menomonee Valley can be a challenge for some. 

The part of the article that bothered me most was the portion that talks about the Menomonee Valley project, something you see in every article about anything Menomonee Valley Related. We keep moving jobs from the suburbs back into the city. That's fine and all, because the skilled workers are here in the city, not in the suburbs. I just wish that more <u>new</u> jobs would be created instead of moved.

Never the less, the Menomonee Valley, a project 20 years in the planning, is finally coming around. Its critics should watch out and its project managers and the city should keep on going in this direction."

"event","Milwaukee Explorer is the brain child of many years of sitting around and thinking about how much I like local Milwaukee news. More then that though, it's news that directly affects the physical City of Milwaukee as an urban environment.

See, that totally makes sense.

This blog has come about thanks to an English class I am taking at UWM this semester. I'm leaving this blog public though, so as it does develop and mature (hopefully) I can link people to it and more people can link to it and so on and so forth, as it the nature of these blogs. Because of this class, this blog is going to be updated at least twice a week, and I think I would like to keep it that way long after the class is done.

Some of you might wonder why I hosted this site on LiveJournal in the first place. I have been using LJ for a few years and am just more comfortable with it.

This blog is going to take news stories that I am interested in and talk about them. Some pictures will be provided to go along with these news stories, and I will go out and take some pictures, hopefully at least once a week. 

I don't claim to be an artist, nor have I ever. I mostly just take pictures because I'll hear about a place or building in the news and not have any pictures to go along with it. My pictures are more about me documenting something and getting personal satisfaction out of it then taking pictures for the sake of ""art"" per say.

I'm a Practical and Technical English major after all.

There is your introduction. Leave any comments, questions, or concerns. I'll take complaints later or never. I don't mind if you comment anonymously, I don't require you to sign up for LJ just to comment. I would like a little tag or such at the end just to keep all of you anons apart from one another though."

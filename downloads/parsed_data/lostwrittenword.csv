"event","So I saw HIDALGO last night with my boyfriend, and it was a pretty good movie. It was pretty much an odd form of a western. But good. I felt so dumb. Boyfriend kept going ha ha, this is just like Lord Of The Rings. And I thought he meant elements of the fighting. So I was like ha ha look its like Star Wars, when they did the flag cermony. Well turns out Viggo Morgenson, (Aragorn.) played Frank Hopkins, so thats what he meant. I knew I knew him but couldn't place my finger on who he was. I was like is that Kevin Costner. In the words of my great nine year old brother. ""I'M AN IDIOT!"" Blah have to write a paper today about an ocean. And I'm tired, I got up for Breakfast with Boyfriend. I Think I shall... Take an hour nap... Yes.. That sounds nice... (IT's 8 a.m.) My Body rejects 7 hours of sleep. It wants like 9 or 10 as usual. Wait I got like 6 or 5. Doesn't matter, cause I'm about to get more!"

"event","They say dreams are a window to your soul. If this is true, my soul must be a Zanadoo of Confusion. I had yet another dream about lose my teeth. It has become an unnatural obsession of mine, ever since I chipped my tooth. This was years ago... But the thought still lingers and stays with me. If anyone knows anything about symbolism in dreams maybe you can help me out. 
It started out dark. In some sort of Castle, where a massive pipe organ dominated like over a hundred floors. And I was there with old Family friends. And we were searching for their oldest daughter, and there were holes in the floors all over the room. As we walked my back right molar fell out. I was like ""Shit,"" but kept going, and as the dream went out my teeth came out in a row. Back to middle front. What does it mean? It may be as simple as me worrying about chipping my tooth again. But I think that would be more obvious to me. For some strange reason I feel this goes deeper than the apparent. Well enough of that dribble.
Its Mid Terms. And I don't know how to study! I've never studyed in my life! I guess I'll have to keep my ears on their toes, in my classes. (That phrase, was shamelessly ripped off from Keaton Branch, of Apollo 18.) 
Sitting between classes is probably the worst part of my day. Waiting. I hate waiting. I'd rather go and have it done with. I like the period from 3- Usually 8, when I have a five hour period of whatever I want it to be. And with the weather as wonderful as its been. I would love to go out to the park and play Frisbee Golf. And for those of you who know the city I live, we have the second largest park within city limits here. Its a nice place. Shady at night, but what park isn't? 
Since I've got some time, I'll type up another entry from my story:

Sun light flooded the room, giving it a bleached white look. The room was so clean. Too clean. Trip hated it. Everything was perfect, and in its place. Trip walked over to the cupboard and opened it. Crystal drinking glasses twinkled at him, than he opened the silverware drawer below the cupboard. A collection of polished silver mirrored fragments of his face. He let out a sigh. There wasn't a single smudge on them. Turning towards the window he observed how the sunlight danced through uniterrupted, not a streak on it. 
Frustration began to build up in Trip's chest. The floor seemed to wink at him as the sun's rays bounced off of it. Cool air blew down on him, sending what should have been a calm cooling sensation, but it filled the boy with nothing but heated rage. A wine glass winked at him from the cupboard, it winked into his soul, it taunted him. 
Rage overtook Trip's body, he began to get hot, his fingers began to tremble. He reached out for the glass and smashed it into the counter's surface with his bare hand. The stinging pain was covered by the pleasure Trip felt now that the wine glass was destroyed. He let his hand rest on the glass, allowing it to cut into him more. 
""Hey, you okay?"" Collin skidded into the room as his socked feet slid on the slick surface of the tile. He glanced down at the red oozing from underneath Trip's hand. ""Dude! What happened?"" Collin ran over to Trip and lifted up his hand, flinching at what he saw. 
""Slipped."" Trip mumbled. 
Collin stared at Trip's bleeding palm. ""That didn't just slip."" He reached out and pulled a large chunk of glass from his friend's palm. Trip didn't flinch as more blood slowly rose out of his torn skin. ""That looks nasty man, you should have a doctor look at that."" 
""I'm fine.""
""Your hand ain't...""
Trip slowly pulled his hand away from Collin's grip and walked over to the sink. The cool water ran over his wound, sending red swirls dancing down the drain. He saw the swirl, his salvation. It was Collin ignoring him for the cartoons, it was his parents leaving him again to go on vaction, it was Jordan's words that ruined his life. Swirling down the drain of the sink was every problem Trip had ever had. A smile slowly crept across the boy's lips."

"event","I am creating this place, as a haven from those in life who could not handle the truth. The ones who do not need to know the storm which rages in my soul. The ones who see the mask and think that is me. When it just colors painted on flesh, smiles, and tears thats meaning is to appease, and delight. This is the real me, stripped bare and naked, no secrets, no lies... just my truth. 

I'm 18. 

I'm Homosexual.

I love life. 

And I'm Ready To Bust Out Of My Shell. 

So This Entry Isn't Totally Pointless I'll Post A Bit From A Story I've Been Working On For The Past Three Years. Love It, Hate It, Critize It... It is What it is... My Art...

Trip took in a deep breath. And touched the razor to his left upper arm. It was cold, so cold his body felt like ice despite the warm water cascading over his naked form. Its touch was almost electric, sending waves of life through him. His grip tightened on the handle as he slowly pushed the razor into his skin, than began to drag it across his skin. It stung. The skin tore apart as if it were tissue paper. Exposing Trip's insides to the stinging air. The air bit into Trip as the blood rushed to his cut and began to pour over, crawling down his arm. 
  The blood entranced Trip as it slowly made it way down his slick naked body. An intense wave of pleasure masked the waves of pain that shot into the gash. Trip smiled as his as all his pain slowly ran down its course to the drain......"

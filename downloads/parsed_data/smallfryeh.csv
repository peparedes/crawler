"event","Most of you know, but for those who don't, I find myself in the midst of yet another huge transition period in my life.&nbsp; Hopefully this is the last HUGE transition period for a long time - I'm ready to be settled.&nbsp; Transition times for me become times when I attempt to become more aware of who I am and who God has created me to be, which often means I'm reading every book I can get my hand on.&nbsp; Lately I have found myself making a list in my head of books that I want to read, but I haven't kept track of them anywhere and I end up forgetting them.&nbsp; So, here's my list (please add those books you think I should add to this list!)

"event","Someone anonymously asked ""What is your biggest regret and your biggest fear?""&nbsp; First - whoever Anonymous is ... I almost don't want to answer this because I'm not sure who asked it...you really ought to sign up for livejournal if you want to dialogue with me :)

My biggest regret ... I honestly don't know that I have a biggest regret (at least not one that I'm comfortable sharing with the entire livejournal and internet world).&nbsp; So - anonymous ... if you really want to know the answer to that question, shoot me an email and let me know who you are :)&nbsp; In all seriousness, my philosophy on regrets is that there's no point having regrets.&nbsp; We all make a thousand decisions in our lifetimes, and if we focus on how we made the wrong decision, our lives become too much about the past and not enough about the present.&nbsp; I think every decision I've made, I've made for a good reason at the time, and God has worked through each decision to show me something new about me and something new about who God is and how God works.

My biggest fear ... is living a life that is not worth living.&nbsp; Leaving this earth and not having an affect on people's lives.&nbsp; Living a life worth forgetting.&nbsp; I want to live my life in such a way that I make an impact on people - that people see God through me.&nbsp; My biggest fear is that I don't do that every day of my life."

I was really bad about answering - for those of you who know me well, you know the months of April and May have been a complete whirlwind (some would call it a disaster, but I consider it a learning experience). So here I am ... catching up on answering the questions.&nbsp; I'll do a separate entry for each question ... so get ready for some reading pleasure!<br /><br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://falling-star24.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://falling-star24.livejournal.com/""><b>falling_star24</b></a></div> asked: ""Ok, what were you like as a little kid?""<br /><br />I really really love this question, but I'm not sure how to answer it.&nbsp; I have asked my mom to see what her thoughts are, but here's what I remember.&nbsp; I was fun.&nbsp; I don't remember causing much trouble - I have always been very tenderhearted and never wanted to hurt anyone's feelings.&nbsp; So when I thought about causing trouble, I immediately thought how badly it would hurt my mom (or other family) and decided against it.&nbsp; Yeah ... I've always been the goody-two-shoes that I am now :)&nbsp; Most of my memories from my childhood are from either church or daycare, and most have my aunts in them.&nbsp; My mom is one of 9 kids - 8 still living (5 girls and 3 boys).&nbsp; When I grew up, three of my aunts plus my mom all lived in Griffin and mom was the only one with kids.&nbsp; So we had a whole bunch of attention and a whole lot of love!&nbsp; My sisters are in just about every memory I have.&nbsp; I am the oldest of three, April is 4 years younger than me and Michelle is 7 1/2 years younger than me, so we were spaced pretty good.&nbsp; Sure, we fought - but we were always very loyal to one another to the outside world.&nbsp; I LOVED church.&nbsp; I was there a lot.&nbsp; We were there every Sunday for Sunday School and Worship, and children's choir was one of my favorite activities - VBS was one of my favorite times of year.&nbsp; My best friend Melissa and I used to try to out-sing each other ... someone even has tapes of it!<br /><br />My mom's thoughts:<br /><span class=""151480014-11062008""><font size=""2"" face=""Arial"" color=""#0000ff"">""Well, you  were happy most of the time. Laughed alot.&nbsp; Smiled alot.&nbsp; Liked to have your  hair pretty, didn't like your clothes or hands to be dirty.&nbsp; Very loving, liked  hugs.&nbsp; Liked to be around mommy or grandma.&nbsp; Liked to read and listen to music.&nbsp;  Just like you are now.""<br /><br /><font color=""#000000"">I guess some people never change :)</font></font></span>"

"event","So I am in my second week of work, and I am liking it so far.&nbsp; I'm not doing too much actual work - as you can tell from the three posts in a row today :)&nbsp;but that will all change next week when the Senior Pastor (who I am actually working for) is back.&nbsp; He's been in Australia the last two weeks, and gets back to the states Saturday.&nbsp; I am getting settled - have some decorations in my office&nbsp;(but most still need to be hung up) and am learning the people and the systems.&nbsp; Today there is a labyrinth set up, so I'm looking forward to taking some time to walk it.

Josh and I are going to RENT at the Fox Theatre Saturday evening and are way super excited about it.&nbsp; We saw it in Cleveland - but we have super close seats this time.&nbsp; I cannot wait.&nbsp; I'm getting settled into Atlanta life, and am loving it more and more each day.&nbsp; Now if I could only get Josh down here - it wouldn't feel so much like a vacation and would actually feel like a new life.&nbsp; Patience grasshopper.

The&nbsp;internet at my apartment has not been working lately.&nbsp; I've been told it's the wi-fi from the Atlanta Fish Market, and probably the whole neighborhood uses it, so I haven't had much time at home on the net - sad face.&nbsp; Luckily, my job hasn't been crazy busy so I don't feel internet-deprived yet :)&nbsp;"

"event","Josh and I are trying to read through the Bible in a year.&nbsp; We have gotten behind, and are now trying to catch up (separately).&nbsp; Last night, I was reading Exodus, and finishing up the story of the plagues.&nbsp; As I read it, I could identify with Pharaoh.&nbsp; Strange identification huh?&nbsp; Everytime a plague hit, Pharaoh gave in to Moses (and so therefore gave in to God).&nbsp; But when the plague was over, Pharaoh went back to his old ways and forgot the awesomeness of God's power.&nbsp; I thought that was a lot like most of my life has been.&nbsp; When bad times hit, or during times of transition, I immediately turn to God - I say that I'm surrendering to His will - that I'm trying to listen to what God's calling me to.&nbsp; Then, when I get in the swing of things and the time of transition is over, or my sadness and confusion has left, I neglect my personal relationship with God (for whatever reason) and try to rationalize that I'm nurturing my personal relationship with God in other ways - that Bible reading and prayer isn't really that important for me.&nbsp; Until another time of sadness, confusion, or transition hits, and the cycle starts all over.&nbsp; I know I'm only human and I will always fall short, but this realization is quite a big one for me.&nbsp; To be able to compare myself to Pharaoh in this story is quite remarkable - in the not positive sense of the word.&nbsp; So, this time, I'd like for me to keep up with the intentional tending of my personal relationship with God.&nbsp; Perhaps from time to time I'll share those reflections on this blog.&nbsp; Sometimes it helps to think it all out and put it out there for other thoughts, if any."

"event","I am officially an employee again.&nbsp; WOOHOO!&nbsp; After a 2 1/2 month hiatus from working, I was ready to go back.&nbsp; It's especially great that my going back to work consists of working at a great place with great people, doing the one thing I am most passionate about - church.&nbsp; There are going to be tons of opportunities for me to plug in at Redeemer, and I am way excited about it.&nbsp; It's gonna be a busy job, that's for sure, but busy in a very good way.&nbsp; My boss isn't there this week or next, so I'm spending my first two weeks getting acclimated to the existing ministries, staff members, and goings on.&nbsp; I spent my first day touring the building (2 hours or so) and learning some basics about the organizational structure of the congregation.&nbsp; Tomorrow's schedule consists of a staff meeting and trying to connect with some of the staff members to learn what they do.&nbsp; It's always interesting going into a new church as a staff member - it can be both a rewarding and not-so-rewarding experience.&nbsp; Luckily, this one seems like it's going to be very positive.&nbsp; The people are all great - very welcoming, and very excited to add me to their staff.

I'm headed out to this cute little Cuban restaurant tonight with two of my girlfriends that I went to AFFIRM with ... it's amazing that the people I consider some of my bestest friends are all people who I only spent a week or so with growing up - it's a wonderful testament to the power of God's community.&nbsp; Anyway - I'm excited for tacos and margaritas with two of my besties :)

In other news - WTF is up with this weather?????&nbsp; I have my frickin' heat on (well, it's not blowing at the moment, but that's because I refuse to set the thermostat up past 65).&nbsp; I didn't bring my coat with me, or many winter clothes for that matter, because I thought it would be warm from here on out.&nbsp; BOO HISS - come back spring time!!"

"event","My last post seemed kinda sad ... I guess I was a little depressed when I wrote it :)&nbsp; Things are better since then, but I always knew they would be ;-)&nbsp; I met most of my neighbors on Monday night and this is gonna end up to be a great place for me to live.&nbsp; There are 10 apartments in our building, and 3 are open, so there are 7 of us plus one boyfriend and plus an old tenant who likes to come around pretty often.&nbsp; It seems to be a great community - a lot of them hang out together pretty frequently and they've been quick to let me know if I ever need anything to not hesitate to ask.&nbsp; At least 3 others have multiple cats and have assured me they would be more than happy to take care of the Sim-man if I ever need to go anywhere.&nbsp; Good to know, since I was a little worried about the week of Affirm :)&nbsp; I had dinner with a new friend (from Vocare) last night, and it was good to have someone to hang out with for a little bit, and then I ran into another Vocare friend today at Whole Foods.&nbsp; It's beginning to really feel like home, which I'm super glad about.

I made a new quilt this week and it is way super cool .. I can't wait until it gets quilted and I can put it on my bed :)&nbsp; Tomorrow I'm going to spend the whole day reading and then Friday I'm gonna head to the mountains for the weekend to pick up a few more things and spend a day or so with Josh before I start work on Monday.&nbsp; I'm ready for Spring to be past and Summer to be here - the pollen is mega-crazy around here.&nbsp; I cleaned my apartment today and the Swiffer was yellow when I got done.&nbsp; GROSS!&nbsp; My whole head feels it too, and the Zyrtec D doesn't seem to be helping any.

Took my car to Saturn today because the stupid thing keeps not wanting to start at random times.&nbsp; I've had it looked at several times because of the same problem, and each time they've sworn that it's been fixed (but obviously not).&nbsp; So you can imagine how frustrated I was to have to take it AGAIN.&nbsp; It wasn't so bad this time because I only had to drive 20 minutes (11 miles) instead of 2 + hours (128 miles).&nbsp; Again, they couldn't find anything wrong with it, but said the negative battery cable was a little loose and my fusebox was loose, so they tightened both, didn't charge me a penny, and sent me on my way.&nbsp; Whaddya know - it started better today than it has in about a year.&nbsp; It's the little blessings in life that make me happiest :)

Smallfryeh because growing up I was always the shortest and littlest, and my friends thought it clever to call me ""Small fry"" and ""Half pint"".&nbsp; When I tried to get ""Smallfry"" as an AIM name, it was taken - so I added a silent ""eh"" to it and it's been that way every since :)

My name is _____ because ______.

Crystal Marie Oxner Klein (Shortened to Crystal Klein if you know me well) because my Mom named me Crystal Marie (not sure where the names came from), my real dad's name is Oxner and I kept it because all my church folk knew me as Crystal Oxner, and Klein because I married into it and wanted a last name other than the one that identified me with my dad.

My journal is titled ____ because ____.

Home of the NuttyPeach because my super cool Ohio BL girls named me the NuttyPeach when I moved from Ohio (the buckeye state - 'nutty') back to Georgia (the peach state - 'peach')

My friends page is called ____ because ____.

I don't think my friends page has a title other than Friends...that's just because i haven't figured out how to change it.

The one you see on this post.  I chose it as my default pic because it's me and Joshie and it's a good picture of the two of us."

Simba is a little nervous, but I think he'll be okay.&nbsp; He's never been an only cat before, so I'm a little worried about him, but my mom says cats are adaptable and he'll be fine.&nbsp; Tigger is here for the weekend, so they're exploring the new place together.

So, on top of the great location, awesome floorplan, and what seem to be pretty good neighbors, I am picking up someone else's wireless internet (it works for internet, but I can't get my entourage to download messages, and I haven't tried to download anything but webpages yet), and I splurged on a $20 rabbit-ear antenna today and I get all the major network channels ... ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, and the CW comes in somewhat - so I am all set to watch all my shows.&nbsp; That means I CAN WATCH AMERICAN IDOL :)&nbsp; I missed last night because I was on my way back to Blairsville, but I'm sure the recap will give me all the info I need.

I'm flat exhausted, so I'm not gonna read through entries - but I'll catch up soon, promise!&nbsp; For now, I'm off to enjoy my new place and rest a little before I have to finish putting clothes away tomorrow.&nbsp; &lt;3"

"event","So it's supposed&nbsp;to rain all week...how in the heck am I gonna move three mattresses (a twin mattress and box spring, and a futon mattress) in the back of a truck from Blairsville to Atlanta if it's gonna rain all frickin' week?&nbsp; Annoying.&nbsp; I'm so ready to be in Atlanta that I'm going crazy ... although I guess I could use the extra time to get things together.&nbsp; My plan is to take a car load down tomorrow and clean the place, and then hopefully Wednesday will be clear enough to move the rest of the stuff down.

I got to go tanning today - I know all the studies about how bad UV rays are and my brain totally tells me I shouldn't go to the tanning bed, but I tell you what ... the time I lay in that bed is amazing.&nbsp; It's total me time.&nbsp; 10-20 minutes of complete ME.&nbsp; Amazing.

Not much else going on - packing, packing, and more packing.&nbsp; It's been a while since my last book review - I've got two on the back burner waiting to be finished.&nbsp; The Bible: A Biography by Karen Armstrong, and I just got Centering Prayer: Renewing an Ancient Christian Prayer Form by Basil Pennington from the library today.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to both of them.&nbsp; I'll have some time without tv (not getting cable for a month at least) so hopefully I'll get to finish one, or both, in the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; Fun books this week include Janet Evanovich's Lean Mean Thirteen (plan to be done with that one tonight) and The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory for April's book club book.&nbsp; I had forgotten how much I love to read :)

Off to evaluate what is left on my checklist to pack :)"

"event","Signed my lease today and got my keys for my new Atlanta apartment.&nbsp; Zip Code 30305.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; Michelle and I ate outside at Moe's (Welcome to Moe's!) while watching traffic and buses go by, had dessert at the Cheesecake Factory, went to Ikea, found our way around back roads to Atlantic Station, tried to figure out the best way for me to get to work (we think Piedmont is the better choice than Peachtree), and ooohed and awwwed at the mcmansions on West Paces Ferry Road (not in any particular order).&nbsp; Atlanta is so completely where I belong.&nbsp; I already have a social group (or two) and am already a member (or almost member) of a book club!

After all that, I'm exhausted.&nbsp; Having breakfast with a friend of mine from my old job in the morning, so I'm excited about that.&nbsp; Then, I get my haircut (so desperately needed) and head to Dickson TN for the SESLYO Assembly.&nbsp; It's gonna be a tiring weekend, but so totally worth it.&nbsp; Monday I'll pack up all my stuff and Tuesday I'll move in.&nbsp; By Thursday I should be a full-fledged Atlantan.&nbsp; I think I'll even send myself a piece of mail so I can get a library card at the Atlanta library on Wednesday or Thursday :)

You probably won't hear from me over the next few days - I'll be without internet.&nbsp; I should try to figure out how to do mobile posting, but not today - my brain is too tired.

I am currently taking donations for a new phone - I'd really like a blackberry (or other similar type) so that I don't have to pay for internet at my new apartment.&nbsp; Anyone who wants to contribute, please feel free to send any donations my way :)&nbsp; 

Enough randomness for one night.&nbsp; Sweet dreams my loves."

"event","According to livejournal, it's been 35 weeks since I last posted.&nbsp; WOOPS!&nbsp; So here I am, posting ... and making a promise to you (whoever may be reading this) that I will do my best to update regularly.&nbsp; I would like for this to be my brainstorming place - so I'll try to be better.

A lot has happened in 35 weeks.&nbsp; Probably the most significant is that I lost my job at the end of January.&nbsp; Since then, I've done a lot of soul searching, praying, listening, reading, and discerning what God is calling me to.&nbsp; I'm reading several books at the moment, all of which have been incredibly wonderful at helping me to be honest with myself about where I am in my personal and spiritual life.&nbsp; I think I'll do a book review of each of them when I finish them, as a way of reflecting on the book and how it affected me.&nbsp; Plus - one more way to update right? :)

The day after I lost my job, I attended an Episcopal Young Adult Gathering called ""Vocare"".&nbsp; Although I was frustrated during the weekend for several reasons, I have to say that it was a transformative weekend for me.&nbsp; I think a lot of it was timing - because I had just lost my job, I was completely open to what God was saying to me.&nbsp; We had a lot of time during the weekend for silence, and I never realized how comforting complete silence can be when you use it to focus on God.&nbsp; Something else I learned from Vocare was the real value of prayer.&nbsp; I have never been one to sit and pray at any specific time - I usually pray by just randomly talking to God.&nbsp; We were given an Anglican Rosary (also known as Anglican Prayer Beads) and I was also given the opportunity to make one to be sold as a fundraiser for the Atlanta area Episcopal Young Adult group.&nbsp; The prayer beads have been an incredible addition to my prayer life - as one whose mind wanders when I try to focus on prayer, it is helpful to have something solid to focus on when saying prayers.&nbsp; The most important thing I learned from Vocare is that I NEED a Christian community.&nbsp; Many of you know that we have been without a church since we moved to GA - we have visited a couple of churches, but never found a place where we truly felt comfortable.&nbsp; We decided to visit the local Episcopal church for Ash Wednesday service, and instantly felt the presence of God.&nbsp; The people were so welcoming, and the service was very centering.&nbsp; I've been participating in their Lenten Evening Prayer services and Lenten study, and it has been a great experience to be a part of a Christian community again.&nbsp; 

We are anticipating a move to Atlanta very soon.&nbsp; When I have firm details, I will post more - it will probably be next week sometime.&nbsp; We have listed the house on craigslist, owners.com and Josh's work intranet.&nbsp; We've had a couple people interested so far, so we're trusting that God will take care of everything in the right time frame.&nbsp; We are learning a lot about surrendering to God's will and trusting that God will supply everything that we need.

Those are the highlights of our life as of right now.&nbsp; Look for a book review tomorrow or Sunday and a ""move update"" sometime soon!"

"event","Last night I read this article in the new Self Recipe magazine about a woman who thrives on cooking healthy meals - cooking is her outlet when she's bored, mad, angry, upset, sad, etc.&nbsp; As I was reading it, I realized just how much I identify with that.&nbsp; When I come home from a long day, the last thing I want to do is cook - right?&nbsp; Nope ... actually, most times I think I don't want to cook but once I get going I absolutely love it.&nbsp; It almost feels like an accomplishment of sorts - take all these little bitty pieces and put it together into one delicious, and healthy, meal.&nbsp; I can make what seems like a meal from a 5-star restaurant in 30-45 minutes and it's way less caloric!&nbsp; One of the things I learned over the last 16 months is that eating healthy doesn't have to be boring - and in fact, eating healthy can be more exciting than eating stuff that society tells us ""tastes so good.""&nbsp; I had McDonalds last week for the first time in about a year, and I can't believe I used to think McDonalds was good.&nbsp; I seriously thought I was gonna puke after eating it.&nbsp; I feel the same way about Taco Bell, Burger King, Wendy's, and just about every other fast food restaurant out there.&nbsp; It sorta sickens me that I used to eat it and like it!

Anyhow - tonight I made Glazed Pork Chops and Apples, with AuGratin potatoes, and Carrot Slaw (just hollar if you want any recipes).&nbsp; The pork chops and apples are finishing up on the grill right now.&nbsp; Popped open a bottle of wine and am letting it air out - got the table set, and I'm ready for my 5-star meal.&nbsp; Now if only I had the restaurant crew to clean up after me

I passed the GA Bar Exam :-)

I know I know, I've heard it from everyone - ""Big surprise - we knew you did"" but - you just never ever know until you finally get the results.&nbsp; My result letter came today.&nbsp; It'll probably be a month or so before I can actually practice in GA - there's a lot left to do ... but it's good to know I can take the next steps.

Not much other news in our lives here.&nbsp; I am absolutely loving my job and I learn a ton every single day.&nbsp; I'm doing mostly estate administration work right now, with some real estate mixed in.&nbsp; I really enjoy the estate administration work, but we see some really sad stories and some disgruntled families.&nbsp; It's so sad how that happens - I hope that whenever my parents die (which I hope is a hundred years from now) me and my sisters can work through it without being jealous of one another.

One other thing - I'm having a Pampered Chef party on May 3 at 6:30pm.&nbsp; I'm excited to host my first party at my new house.&nbsp; I've always liked being a host, but never really had the group of friends to invite over for any particular reason, so this should be fun.&nbsp; If you've ever wanted to order Pampered Chef stuff but never had a contact, send your order in to me and I'll make sure you get it :)

Mike and I will be together for a year on the 9th of next month. CRAZY SHIT! I am going to MA tomorrow. I do not want to go. I just recently found out that Mike is going to Rome or Greece with his Math class sometime this year. I do not want him to go that far away. I do not like the idea of that. I have been talking to Chelsea lately. That is nice. Yeah so I am not going to talk anymore bye..."

The Murder Junkies and The Jabbers are playing at the Littleton Opera House along with The Rydells, The Jonee Earthquake Band, and perhaps Black Listed. That is Crazy Black Listed might actually be able to play with The Murder Junkies and The Jabbers. What a fucking honor. Holy Shit... I am so excited about going to this show man. After the show there is going to be a gathering at GG's grave in Littleton. Jesus I am happy I moved here.

He had to be going over 100 and he took a sharp turn and went into a ditch. a 35 foot drop. Paul is okay He has a bruised lung a cracked rib and a broken collar bone and some random bruises and shit. We went and saw him yesterday in the hospital. But Eddie got thrown through the windshield and now he can not move the lower half of his body. I really hope that everything will be okay and he is not paralyzed. that is horrible.
also, Last night my Mom freaked out on us and told me that she was going to send my brother and me back with my father. So I think I am going to go because if she does not want me here then I am not going to stay.

"event","I was informed last night I may be the new singer of a local punk band called <b>Black Listed</b>. They kicked out one of their guitarists and now the singer wants to go full time guitar. I hope this happens because they have already established a name for themselves. but it will be hard to live up to people's expectations for us because they are an awesome band. I'll probably fuck it up for them. anyway the band as of now is...
Andy- Bass (Mike's little brother who I am convinced is homosexual despite his mohawk and ""punk"" appearance)
Chris- Guitar and vocals (Kristi's cousin....I really do not know him at all but he seems like a cool kid...)
AJ- Drums (I tried to beat this kid's ass a few months ago but Tina stopped me hahaha)
My friend Derek was the one who got kicked out. hope there will be no hard feelings between us. 

and also Monday I went to the Manchester mall with Tina and Ariel. When we were driving down Ariel's road Tina lost control of the car and we almost slammed into a wall but Tina managed to drive into a snow bank instead. We all thought the car was going to flip. Tina prayed and spoke in tongues for about half an hour after that. We got lost in Manchester. Then we got to the mall a lot later then was expected and I met up with Jake. I wanted to tell him about Mike but I did not have the heart. We left at around 7:30ish....We got lost again for awhile and Drove down a one way street the wrong way thanks to Ariel who can not say left or right instead it is <b>that way!</b> but that is okay. Then as we were driving through the Franconia notch (The worst place to drive during the winter) and did the same thing but this time is was a million times scarier because it was on the highway and we went in a complete circle because Tina did not want to hit the guardrail thing. Surprisingly Her car is hardly damaged at all Her door is a little fucked up and her license plate is bent but that is because she hit the pole that be were parked behind at the mall. forward reverse it is all the same damn thing...haha but Tina is a really good driver nevertheless. heh and a bunch more shit is going on that is will write about later because my class is going to end any minute.

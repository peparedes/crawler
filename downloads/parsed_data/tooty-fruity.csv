I dont know why i've been crying all day, its what i've wanted from the start. I can't stand living with her. But somehow, its all to much. Don't know what to do until may now. Tricky stuff.
My fault? Am I actually a Bitch, did I drive her to it, or is she just jelous and resenting me?
I'll never know because I can't talk to her without her reducing to tears. That sounds like i'm the Bitch, but I let her say her list of things she doesnt like about living with me, an i sat an took it an prepared to discuss it like adults. I didnt interupt and I didnt defend myself, but as soon as its my turn to tell her the things I dislike about her, she cries. Thats why I feel so bad. I know I shouldn't. It's not my fault she has no balls an has been wrapped up in cotton wool. The thing is no one in her life has ever said 'no Katie.'
She's the girl that gets what she wants, and everyone steps around. Well I step around no one an say what I think, and we're 20 year olds and she still rings mammy. 
Sorry if I dont care, infact not sorry.
Katie, I don't care that you're moving out cos you hate me, infact, I'm glad you hate me, cos at least now theres reason to move out and leave me the fuck alone.

"event","I read of a man who stood to speak at the funeral of a friend 
He referred to the dates on her tombstone, 
From the beginning...to the end. 
He noted that first came her date of birth 
And spoke the following date with tears, 
But he said what mattered most of all 
Was the dash between those years. (1934 - 1998) 
For that dash represents all the time 
That she spent alive on earth... 
And now only those who loved her, 
Know what that little line is worth. 
For it matters not, how much we own; 
The cars...the house...the cash, 
What matters is how we live and love 
And how we spend our dash. 
So think about this long and hard... 
Are there things you'd like to change? 
For you never know how much time is left, 
That can still be re! arranged. 
If we could just slow down enough 
To consider what's true and real, 
And always try to understand 
The way other people feel. 
And be less quick to anger, 
And show appreciation more 
And love the people in our lives 
Like we've never loved before. 
If we treat each other with respect, 
And more often wear a smile... 
Remembering that this special dash 
Might only last a little while. 
So, when your eulogy's being read 
With your life's actions to rehash... 
Would you be proud of the things they say 
About how you spent your dash?"

[Eminem] You want me to tell you somethin?
[A Lady] Uh-huh
[Eminem] I know what you want to hear
[Chorus One: Eminem]
I know you want me baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
I want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I want to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
(Ooh boy you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me earl
[Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound, I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
in a relationship, save it bitch
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin shit
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muh'fuckin slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick - get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice, to buy you ice?
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin to be my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
[Bridge: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass
on that fuckin runway ho
[Chorus Two: Eminem]
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman your Superman
[Eminem]
Don't get me wrong - I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't want to flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
[Bridge]
[Chorus One]
[Eminem]
First thing you say, ""I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
you're just plain old Marshall to me""
Ooh yea girl run that game
""Hailie Jade? I love that name!
Love that tattoo - what's that say?
Rot in pieces? Uh, that's great""
First off you don't know Marshall
at all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool {*AHH!*}
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy whodi
you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a tampax
and slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans
[Bridge]
[Chorus One]
[Chorus Two] - repeat 2X"

friday i went to the first skateday in a LONG ass time. diego, chris, brian, london, mike, me,and thomas all went to morffys and skated then went to londons sexy house where we watched a rad skate video. (oh yeah and zac was there too.) it got real cold so we went back to morffys and hid inside for awhile until val and scooter showed up and then we all went outside and played some b-ball. after that me and tom skated back to my house and on the way we went......STREAKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that was fun as hell. thanks for the idea tom.      after that toms parents picked us up and we went to his house and skated and built a cool ramp out of plywood and shit from a house that is being built.. also streaked some more lol. we got in the hot tub and jumped in the freezing pool. that was all dandy. in the morning i went home and did absolutely nothing but be lazy up until i had to get ready for daynas party. i went to daynas party and was really happy to see dayna again. ive missed her alot! i wish i could see her more often but i doubt that will ever happen. anyway we all sung happy birthday and all that jazz. it was extremely loud with like 15 hot girls in the house....im not gonna complain about that but anyhow... it was very good to see dayna again. and that was that.. oh.. except for the fact that zac suprised me and macked this one hottt chick and got her number by the end of the night... GO ZAC!!!!!!!!

"event","I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you

Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good

I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it would come to this

Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Pain (x3)
You know you're right (x5)

I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
Steaming soup begins to melt

Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love himself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew it would come to this

Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Pain (x5)
You know you're right (x17)

"event","i long for the good old days. the days when i had friends. the days when id go to chris' and do random stuff. the summer.
its all changed now. and its all sed and done. theres nothing i can do now. i cant change it. this will be my last time ranting about how i lost my best friend.
i just sit at home now with nothing to do except imagin the good ol days. damn i miss those days. not a day goes bye that i dont think about back when and how much i would do anything to have it like it was. 


well i will say no more about that from now on.
i wanna have somethin to do. i fucking sit at my house and get fat as fuck. (which i already am). 
ive thought about getting high or something to that effect. theres nothing better to do. i dont know. thats proly wat ill end up doing but idk

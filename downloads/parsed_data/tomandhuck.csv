"event","Hello world. My apoligies to those of you who have http://www.livejournal.com/users/tomandhuck set as their home page and check it every time they go online for updates because there hasn't been an update in a while so here goes.

Well today I found out that I lost in my campaign to become the Senior Class President. Yeah, I got burned. Kinda disappointed. Ok I'll stop lying, very disappointed. Oh, well maybe next year. Also, I'm burning from my many tests that I failed today. And I'm starting to feel the burn from the 7 exams that are quickly approaching. Oh well, nothing a little Icy/Hot can't heal.

The owners, producers, writers and janitors of this very LJ have a new project. We're writing a screenplay. All we can say is that it's an ""EPIC DRAMA."" We spent several hours working on it this past weekend, ironing out different characters and plot line(s). More on that to come.

-Huck

PS Sorry about the last post I don't know what I was thinking."

""With a heavy heart, I turned and walked away. I knew that as long as I lived I'd never forget the two little graves and the sacred red fern.""

Where does your red fern grow? Do you even have a red fern? You might even have a red fern and not know it? A red fern is a memory, a marker, a bookmark, a reminder, and a best friend. So my advice to you friend is this: find your red fern and never let it go. Hold it, cherish it, and keep it close. Everyone needs a red fern to look for, to remember and to help them never forget. Then, a red fern helps you move on, find yourself discover a new cool thing, a new friend, a new hobby, a new love, a new life, a new home. Home. Thats where I want to be. Thats where I am. HOME. HOMe. HOme. Home. home.


Find your fern,
Huck"

"event","So today was our English AP exam which was surprisingly short, it only lasted 9 fortnights. It was cinchy (hooray for 4th grade!). Collar went up and I aced that bitch. The French AP exam was today as well. For all who took that, may they rest in peace. Like we know any French...

After the exam was donuts in the Tropicana Field parking lot. Shitty white Civics rule. We got up to like 70 mph and then pulled a 360. Scariest. thing. evar. There was also much jumping over thrill hill and driving down busy streets backwards. Charles - you are the wheelman. In case we got pulled over, our crack team assembled a great line to say to the pigs: ""I thought cops liked donuts!"" HAHAHA! Get it!? Ah, fuck... it was lame, guess you had to be there.

Yesterday I saw Man on Fire which was pretty sweet. Denzel is the coolest black person ever. I can't think of many other cool black people. Maybe some athletes but anyone who sticks C4 up someone's ass and detonates it with a remote (how mortifying...) is right up there for the ""coolest person ever award"" along with the guy who cut his own arm off with a Swiss Army knife to save his life. 

Well I need to clean my room so until next time,

"event","Well, seeing as how I have not updated in a while I figured now would be an ideal time.  I think it is now safe to say that the tomandhuck live journal has officially ""made it"" with the advent of the first copycat, which may or may not have been established by theffej7. 

Friday night I saw The Producers at TBPAC with the most random assortment of people of all time, if you would like to hear the list of those in attendence please inquire within. Anyway, the show was absolutely PHENOMENAL. It's a musical that makes fun of jewish people, non-jewish people, old people, young people, actors, producers, gay people, straight people, and Adolf Elizabeth Hitler. Infact the entire show was downright hilarious. If more details are needed just ask me. Huckleberry gives it two thumbs way way up. But as cool as the show was the chance to hang out with a group of people who I would of normally never hung out with and people who would never have gone to a show or done something like that together. It was just neat to see people not caring about what ""group"" they were in and just having a good time. To top it all off one of the lead roles was played by Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

Next time we'll discuss;
What it's like being me.
What is art?
and
Where does the red fern really grow?

"event","It seems as though Huck and I have competition from ""theffej7"". Who is this masked live journal author??? Could it be the infamous Jeff Holder who's AIM moniker is ""theffej7""? Nah... that would be too easy.

I now know that I can talk shit about Zak in this journal since his internet filter blocks it out. Apparently his mommy's filter doesn't like my profane language. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits! Whatever, he can go read Jeff's and miss out on all the fun.

Europe is in 29 days. It will be hypercool. ""I love [Europe] with all of my body (including my pee pee)"" (Hamburger 1). If you didn't get that line you were waaaaaay out of the loop about 2 years ago: check out www.realultimatepower.net. There are some negatives to the Europe trip though. One is that the statistically easiest SAT, the June session, happens when we're across the pond. And The Darkness are coming to Tampa Bay. Eye heart The Darkness.

What ever happened to the Beastie Boys? They were ""money makin'"" and letting ""beat[s] drop"" and now they are gone. Secret break up? Plane crash? The world may never know...

Tijuana Flats sells Pez! Score.

Mr. Walsh's dating tip of the week: If you want a cheap date where you will get lots of laughs - go to night court. It's like a conveniently located Jerry Springer show. (Yeah, I didn't believe it either. Apparently I ""need to learn how to play""...) Cory and I are going to test it out and I'll get back to you all.

"event","Hello. How is everyone?  Well I'm fine thank you. First, I'd like to start off by saying everyone vote for me for Senior Class President. Next topic on the agenda: K vs I football game, yeah it was good, I couldn't believe we didnt have a megaphone and next year we will finally win, hopefully. Yeah, so the Lightning are pretty tight, which by the way I have known since the 92-93 innaugural season and which was reconfirmed by my attendence at game 4 of the 96 playoffs against the Fliers which set the record for single game playoff attendence. Yeah not much else is new, my job from hell, playing soccer with little kids at Canterbury is finally over. 

Today it finally set in that we're seniors. I dont know about you Tom but it just seems kinda strange, and most definatley kinda awesome. I think I don't want this week to end. I think this is one of the best weeks of the year for the following reasons. 1. You have to go to school but there's nothing that you have to do. 2. It's just like summer only it doesnt count against the allotted days of summer.  I think those are pretty good reasons.

By the way I'm beginning to get more comfortable opening up and talking to the world, so stay tuned.

Dressing up as a little boy was kinda gay (lollipop rocked), just gayer than dressing up for move up by a pubic hair.

Onto the goooooood stuff:

I got my extended essay topic approved today: Probabilities in gambling. I fucking rule.

Props to the Vikes for getting an A+ in the draft. Slops to the Pack who took a PUNTER in the 3rd round. Congrats fucktards, I mean it's not like he would've been there in the 6th round or anything...

Lightning are quietly dominating the playoffs. Go Bolts! What a fairweather fan I am... sickening, isn't it?

CISS test was rather informative. Props to whoever implemented that. Possibly the best ten bucks I've ever spent. It confirmed my suspicions: I'M AN UBER NERD. Come on... who's #1 best fit is statistician? At least my 3rd best was CEO/President. That one would be epic.

I have heard them play great bands like The Eagles, Doobie Brothers, Creedence Clearwater Revival, James Taylor, Fleetwood Mac, Cat Stevens, Elton John and the like. Infact when I am not listening to the Lonestar greatest hits CD or my new Fastball CD (which was kindly burned for me by a friend) then I listen to 107.3. Entonces, if 107.3 is at a commercial break I'll flip it over to 98.7, 101.5, 93.3 or 99.5 if I'm feeling adventurous. 

School this week was rough. Actually not really. I had stuff to do and I did most of it. I rock and rolled all night and partied every day, but watch out because; oo, baby baby it's a wild world. It's hard to get by just upon a smile girl. 

Also lets go over what else is going on in my life. Well im mentally preparing for the Key vs Interact football game, hopefully I will come away in one piece with no internal bleeding or significant organ damage. 

Also I am looking forward to summer.

"event","So, um, yeah... Girl Next Door is awesome. I'm so fucking writing a screen play about high school life. Much inspiration from the writers of American Pie who dormed w/ my bro @ MSU. Pimp My Ride is awesome too. Best show on TV (Wait, that's Chappelle's show). Did you guys see the Hi-Jet??? 17"" Giovannis on a Hi-Jet. The spoiler was gay but it had 3 plasma screen TVs and a fucking VIDEO CAMERA on the front of the car. How unnecessary... World Poker Tour is screamin' too. It's always been awesome but now it's awesomer. Is it just me or is one of the best parts of the show the lame ass announcing of Mike Sexton and ""Home Game Master"" Vince Van Patten? And who are these chumps that get on the show? Some of the worst poker playing ever takes place in the first 10 hands of EVERY show. 

One thing that is not awesome is the length of Guys And Dolls. 3 fucking hours? You have to be kidding me, especially sitting on wooden seats... I feel like a slave. Speaking of slaves, the Key Auction is on Tuesday and the football game is on Wednesday. Go to both. How about Madame Griffin being a stupid ho? French is shit. Period. Je fume les roches. That's all I can say - and it means I smoke rocks. Sad, sad shit. 

Hooray for 11 exams! I feel like a fucking mongoloid and these next few weeks are gonna be hell. And then there was light and that light was Europe. Oh yeah, prom is tomorrow. I'm stoked, it should be fun. Much tingery for prom. Does anyone else love 107.3 The Eagle? Somehow ""classic hits"" are epic. Lovin' it, lovin' it.

Another question - does anyone feel sorry for Charles? He got his tires and his favorite beanie stolen... no? Yeah, me neither. Well, I'm off like a prom dress.... aww shit. That was so much less weird when I was in 8th grade.

Cheers.

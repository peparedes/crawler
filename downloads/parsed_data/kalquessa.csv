"event","Does this thing still work? Let's find out. Wow, this looks different. Weird. Okay. Hi, Livejournal! I logged on to look for something today, and I realized that I miss you guys and have no idea what most of you are doing anymore unless you use Facebook. So in the spirit of catching up:

1. I am moving house in less than a week and should not be playing on the computer! That's actually why I got on LJ this morning, all of my books are packed and I need something to read so I thought I'd log on and find links to some old fanfic that I could reread. 

2. A while back, I made <lj-cut text=""this"">this:
<lj-embed id=""10""/></lj-cut> 
I call it ""Theodore."" It is currently engaged in emptying all the bins of toys onto the floor.

3. I would give you a picture of what Bear looks like now but holy crap, HTML is hard when you're using an iPad and it's trying to be all helpful and really it's just causing trouble and WILL YOU JUST LET ME TYPE, IPAD!! You'll just have to take my word for it that Bear is a bright-faced, blue-eyed, four-and-a-half-year-old wunderkind who is learning to read and control his theatrical impulses when appropriate. (I wish. He's really just learning to read. The other thing is totally beyond him, still.) If you Facebook and wish to make his visage and hilarious utterances part of your newsfeed, feel free to find and friend me.

4. Current tv obsession: Korean dramas. You guys, Kdramas are awesome. Anyone who wants to give or receive recommendations, hit me.

5. Is the Stargate fandom still a thing? Bear was asking me questions about my SG-1 DVDs the other day, and it set me wondering.

6. I know the Supernatural fandom must still be a thing because the show is still running, somehow. I recently watched Season 8 after some time away from the show. Can't say I am overwhelmed with love for the show, anymore, but it was nice to have the boys back on my tv. Not every episode is a good one, but every episode makes me laugh and want to hug a Winchester at least once.

7. LONG TIME NO SEE HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING??? *tacklehugs*"

"event","Dear Supernatural:

Okay, so we've been kind of on-again-off-again the last few seasons, partly because I have so little tv time these days and partly because, let's be honest, you haven't exactly been on your game much of late (and when you <i>were</i> on your game you were making me feel kicked and sad half the time). And I was actually kind of hoping that you would continue to go slowly, steadily pear-shaped until you were so not worth my time that I could just give you up altogether and have space in my schedule for a new show (Alphas looks really cool, and my mom keeps bugging me to try Blue Bloods). Except, this new season is not really conforming to my expectations at all. In that so far it has really kind of rocked my socks.

What the heck, show? Thanks for totally ruining my plans. 

Love,

Marie"

"event","I have read books! I have had thoughts on them! These thoughts include but are not limited to:

<i><b>The Name of the Wind</i> by Patrick Rothfuss</b> - Very entertaining. The first straight-up, sword-and-sorcery fantasy that I've read in a long time, and I heartily enjoyed this return to a genre that I pretty much lived in for my teen years. <lj-cut>I love Rothfuss's humor, his sense of poetry and drama, and his worldbuilding. That said, it's not without its flaws. Rothfuss has several verbal ticks ala Robert Jordan, so he tends to repeat phrases until you are ready to stab him in the face the next time he mentions anyone being chilled, known, possessed, or anything else ""down to the marrow of his/her bones."" Not really his fault, but I feel like someone in the editing food chain could have done something about this without hurting themselves. Also, there's a big section in the middle that sort of reads like it was originally written by a seventeen-year-old about his RPG character. Which makes it sound much worse than it is. No seventeen-year-old with an RPG character ever wrote this well. It's just that the bones of the story at that point are still just recognizable as those of a wish-fulfillment Mary Sue fantasy. The writing and the fact that Rothfuss can be hilariously funny make up for it, though, and there is magic that requires math and conversion tables. Thumbs up.</lj-cut>

<i><b>The Wise Man's Fear</i> by Patrick Rothfuss</b> - The sequel is even more enjoyable and involves even more fun worldbuilding. I am such a sucker for some good, chewy worldbuilding, guys. And worldbuilding that also makes me laugh out loud a lot? Sold. <lj-cut>Rothfuss still makes tediously repetitive references to bone-marrow, alas, and a few more of his repeatedly-reused phrases get really out of control, but I didn't get that ""Did you come up with this part when you were still in highschool?"" feeling from any of it. I <i>did</i> become stupendously bored with a small section in the very middle which brought the action--which up till then had been going along at quite a respectable clip--to a crashing halt. But that part was mercifully brief (though not brief enough) and after it came, yes, <i>more awesome worldbuilding wheeee!</i> I am definitely looking forward to the third instalment, which comes out...some time in the future? I have no idea. My husband owns a bookstore, he keeps track of these things for me.</lj-cut>

<b><i>Whose Body?</i> by Dorothy Sayers</b> - Yes, I finally dove into the Lord Peter Wimsey novels for the first time not long ago, and what a delightful dive it was. <lj-cut>Lord Peter is awesome. Bunter is even more awesome. Lord Peter's <i>mom</i> is awesome. There is more witty banter than I ever dreamed could be contained within such a tiny book. I kind of guessed who the killer was pretty early on and I didn't even care because it was such a pleasure to watch Lord Peter et al work it out. It's like Jeeves and Wooster fighting crime! (Only, of course, Lord Peter only <i>pretends</i> to be Wooster, whereas Wooster actually <i>is</i> Wooster.) I am so in love. More, please.</lj-cut>

<i><b>The Martian General's Daughter</i> by Theodore Judson</b> - I loved <i>Fitzpatrick's War</i> and have re-read it multiple times, so it seemed like a good idea to read something else by the same author. <lj-cut>Having now added a second data point to my research, I feel confident in stating that Judson likes to write about future civilizations crumbling under the weight of corrupt, powerful people while sympathetic characters look on in a steampunk-ish sort of setting. This book was a decent, solidly-written book, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as well as <i>Fitzpatrick's War</i>. It probably wasn't helped at all by the fact that I read it during a period of weeks when Bear had decided that he wasn't going to takes naps ever, at all. I don't think I'd be in a position to really, truly love <i>any</i> book read in such a haze of stress and exhaustion. So there's that. But this book also has much less humor to than <i>Fitzpatrick's War</i>, and that makes things harder for me to like, too. I give this points for the craftsmanship of it, but the characters didn't make me love them and I didn't laugh, so not something I feel like I can strongly recommend.</lj-cut>

<b>The Engineer Cycle by K.J. Parker</b> Okay. Here's the thing: <lj-cut><i>Designs and Desires</i> was good, solid, and incredibly well-written. I was in awe of Parker's ability to just keep writing good sentences. A little skimpy on the humor side at times, but nothing I couldn't handle, plus OMG masterful worldbuilding! <i>Evil for Evil</i> was just as well written but about five times less funny, which was detrimental considering the first book was not really funny enough for me to begin with. Also, I began to suspect that Parker might hate women a little bit. <i>The Escapement</i> crushed my humor-craving spirit under the heel of its doomy, depressing boot and convinced me that, yes, Parker does hate women. Kind of a lot, in fact. Also, the last book made me really hate the two characters that I had liked most at the outset of the story, and that made me really sad. It also made me love a character that I had barely thought twice about in the first book, which <i>should</i> sort of balance things out, but it left him in a profoundly depressing place at the end. There were times when it felt like a punishment to read this series, but I kept reading because a) the writing itself is <i>so good</i> and b) I had no idea how wretched every single character would be at the end. So I read a trilogy of absolutely enormous books which were just <i>exquisitely</i> written but made me feel like a kicked puppy. No more Parker for me, thanks ever so.</lj-cut>

<i><b>Blackout</i> and <i>All Clear</i> by Connie Willis</b> - Connie Willis is in danger of becoming my favorite living writer. I've loved many of her books over the past few years, but this? This was so...<i>so</i>. So <i>everything</i>. <lj-cut>So sad and so joyous. So thrilling and so heartwarming. So <i>absolutely crazy-making</i> and so satisfying. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love with the Britain of World War II. I chewed my nails and hugged myself out of sheer delight. I called <lj user=""izhilzha""> and declared my need for moral support. I stared in horror at the page because I was <i>convinced</i> the author was going to end it the <i>wrong way</i> and gasped with relief when she didn't. I wrote an incoherent review committing excessive use of italics throughout. Read these books. You will not be sorry. There is time-travel and hilarity and death-defying ambulance rides through London burning. There is St. Paul's and shopgirls and counter-intelligence and Ultra. It is so--so!--good, guys. Read it, I beg you."

"event","So I've been on an old movie kick lately, and I watched ""All About Eve"" for the first time a few days ago. Or rather, I should say, I finished watching it a few days ago because my life does not lend itself well to seeing an entire movie all in one go without interruption. But anyway. The movie was awesome and I looked it up on Wikipedia to see what sort of fun trivia was to be had there, and something struck my fancy and stuck in my head: it said that Anne Baxter was cast in the title role because the director felt she had the ""bitch virtuosity"" to carry it off. 

I loved that: bitch virtuosity. It struck me that this was exactly the term for why I adore <i>Gone With the Wind</i>. Scarlett O'Hara is, I think, quite a bit more sympathetic than Eve Harrington. Scarlett does unforgivable things less out of sheer self-interested ambition and more out of fear and a wonderfully messed-up sense of duty. The result is the same with both of them, though: they remorselessly ruin the lives of just about everyone around them and end up heartily miserable because of it. I don't know why I love watching this happen so much, but I do. 

So I come to you, LiveJournal, with a question I can't plug into the search function on Netflix or Amazon: Are there other excellent examples of bitch virtuosity out there that I haven't watched or read yet? I wish to consume more! MOAR!"

<blockquote><i>There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The </i>Lord of the Rings<i> and </i>Atlas Shrugged<i>. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs. </i></blockquote>

Word.

""Dude, if <i>I'd</i> been Lucy? I would have brought a bucket of snow back with me and dumped it on my siblings. Bet they'd believe me after that.""

Heh."

"event","So I went to Knott's Berry Farm with a bunch of cool people for <lj user=""ladybrick"">'s birthday on Sunday. And the thing is, I've never really been a roller coaster person. Or, well, I've always liked roller coasters, but I liked them the same way I like horror movies: I think they're groovy-cool, and it makes me happy that they exist, and I <i>wish</i> I liked actually watching them, but I don't, really.

But I went to Knott's, and here is the thing I discovered: I like roller coasters before I get on them and after I have been on them for about ten seconds. It's just those first ten seconds where I find them absolutely terrifying. I wrote a timeline to demonstrate my thought process.

<b>Looking at the coaster, deciding whether to get in line:</b> That looks okay, it doesn't go backwards or have a lot of loops. Yeah, I want to go on this one.

<b>In line:</b> This will be fun! I will get on the roller coaster and enjoy it and I will finally be a person who likes roller coasters!

<b>Next in line:</b> I'm sort of nervous, actually. But I'm going to get on the roller coaster, because why did I stand in line this whole time? I'll be fine.

<b>Putting on seat belt:</b> Yeah, this'll be fine. Totally, totally fine.

<b>Click, click, click, click, click:</b> Wait. I hate roller coasters. WHY AM I INESCAPABLY HARNESSED INTO A TINY LITTLE TRAIN CAR OF DEATH??? I WANT TO GET OFF!!

<b>After the first big drop:</b> *whimper* Is it over? Do I get to get off, now?

<b>Five seconds later:</b> Hey, there's kind of a rhythm to this. 

<b>Five seconds after that:</b> Haha, this is kind of fun! Wheee!

<b>End of ride:</b> That was fun! I love roller coasters!

Sadly this happens on <i>every</i> ride, not just the first one of the day. So I had given myself a headache by dinner time and my shoulders are still sore from all the clenching and clinging and holding on for dear life.

Also? That Sidewinder ride with the swivelly cars? Pure evil. But the Pony Express one was fun. And there was pie and excellent company, so an overall win."

"event","Since Fee asked for a link:

<a href=""http://www.food.com/recipe/fannie-farmers-classic-baked-macaroni-and-cheese-135350"">This recipe for baked macaroni and cheese?</a> Is awesome. I made a triple batch because I cook for twelve really hungry people and I wanted leftovers, and <i>dude</i>, I ended up with more food than we could ever possibly eat, even if we sat here for two days. 

Though I think I made the sauce even thicker than it was supposed to be. It wasn't my fault, I didn't have enough macaroni, so I had to cook some of another bag of pasta in another pot (because I learned the hard way that if you try to cook two types of pasta together, one will almost always be over/undercooked). And I wanted to heat the milk in a separate saucepan instead of adding it to the roux cold, because that's the way I've always done it, and my sister says it's important. And I am terrified of leaving a roux cooking unstirred for even a second because on the first recipe my sister ever gave me that involved a roux she included a personalized note about how ""stir constantly"" really meant ""stir constantly"" and if I wandered off to smell flowers and read books while the roux was cooking it would burn and KITTENS WOULD DIE! I don't want to be responsible for any kittens dying, do I? No. So I had two pots of pasta that had to be stirred frequently, a pan of cream and milk that had to be stirred frequently and watched carefully to make sure it didn't do that thing where it just suddenly boils over when you'd swear it wasn't even hot when you stuck your finger in it a minute ago, plus a roux that had to be stirred constantly for fear of kitten murder. 

This was, of course, the time that my toddler chose to have a meltdown about <i>nothing whatsoever</i> (actually, he was hungry, I just had no way of knowing that because he wasn't using his words and it was way early for him to eat dinner). So I was trying to stir four pots <i>and</i> conduct the series of trial-and-error tests that are familiar to everyone who has ever tried to figure out why a one-and-a-half-year-old just got down on the floor and started wailing. 

It was a little involved, there, for a bit. 

But on the upside, though getting the dish into the oven was nerve-wracking, it also didn't take very much time. And I managed to briefly distract Bear from his tantrum by shredding six cups of cheese in the Cheese Obliterator. That was pretty cool. And Bear ate a huge serving before I put it in the oven, plus another helping when I ate <i>my</i> dinner. So I think it's safe to assume it's toddler approved. 

Anyway. Baked mac-n-cheese. Highly recommended. Though I think next time I'm putting it all together during Bear's naptime, and just refrigerating it till it's time to go in the oven. Yes."

"event","I am too tired to provide anything like meaningful commentary, but a discussion at my mom's group this morning made me think of these two quotations in conjunction with one another, and I wanted to post them in case I forgot later. Hopefully the connection between them still makes sense in the morning.


<blockquote><i>If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing. </i>

-- 1 Corinthians 13: 1-3</blockquote>

...and...

<blockquote><i>""We want nothing from you that you do without grace,"" Mrs. Whatsit said, ""or that you do without understanding."" </i>

-- <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> by Madeline L'Engle</blockquote>

"event","Dear Stargate:

So I lent all my DVDs to a friend a while ago and he's been watching them and sending me e-mails and talking to me about them with great animation whenever I have a chance to see him in person, and the other day I was sick and had an hour to myself while Bear the Destroyer took a nap, and I was like, ""Hey, I haven't watched any Stargate in a heckuva long time, and I have my early season DVDs back now, I think I will watch the one where Sam and Jack get stuck in Antarctica and Daniel and Teal'c have to figure it out and save them before they freeze.""

And then I was like, ""Oh, man, I forgot how much I love this show.""

I've watched five episodes in the past few days, and I don't always get to give them my full attention because one-and-a-half-year-olds, as it turns out, are <i>never still</i> and they're really smart in that they can get into an amazing number of supposedly child-proof things, but they unfortunately do not quite grasp concepts like ""safe,"" ""unsafe,"" and ""gravity."" They do like goa'uld motherships, ring transports, and the kawoosh, however.

Anyway, I just wanted to thank you for still being awesome. *smish*

Love,

Marie"

"event","Wow, so far today, I have:

- made two big cash deposits for Mr. Bill without a single hitch 

- found everything I was looking for at Target with no trouble

- got to my lunch date with Mr. Bill early so I had time to fill up my gas tank first

- found a $15 toy that the boy LOVES for three bucks at the thrift store

All of this, mind you, with a toddler who did not tantrum or fuss AT ALL, and who is now in bed, having his nap <i>on schedule</i>.

I feel like I should go out and buy a lottery ticket, or something.

"event","The other night, I had a dream about trying to solve a murder at a remote and snowed-in mountain resort. I was acting as some kind of assistant to both Kate Beckett from Castle, who was the lead detective on the case, and Shawn Spencer from Psych, who had been called in to consult. My duties mostly involved keeping Beckett from killing Shawn long enough to catch the murderer. It was awesome, but kind of nerve-wracking, since Shawn was determined to annoy and flirt with Beckett at every opportunity.

Then last night, I had another Supernatural dream where I was Sam and Dean's kid sister. In this one, some kind of jinx had been put on the car, and Dean was convinced it was because of something I'd done (involving a sandwich, oddly) and was chewing me out. I kept trying to explain that it wasn't me and appealing to Sam for support, but he was way more interested in fixing the problem than in getting entangled in our argument, so I spent the whole dream (which involved preventing people from being turned into fish ghosts, don't ask) feeling ill-used and sniping at both of them.

I think my subconscious watches too much tv. What I want to know is when it finds the time, since I usually can't. *eyebrow*"

But it has all these interactive map functions and it can play videos and store music and who knows what else that I don't really know how to use not because I can't figure it out but simply because I can't fit my head around a world where my phone does these things. Meanwhile, I'm totally psyched that when I tap my homepage it makes ripples in the pond that is my wallpaper, and I'm mildly frustrated because I have not yet discovered an easy-peasy way to make the old X-men cartoon theme my ringtone. 

I feel like someone's grandma. Someone's grandma that spent most of a year watching X-men at 8:00 am every weekday morning when she was fourteen, sure, but someone's grandma nonetheless."

"event","I have been without a computer of my own for a couple of months, ever since Jujube fried its motherboard and died. Best Buy, having been compelled to do so by the service plan my dad bought for me, has finally replaced Jujube with another Jujube that purportedly works and is less likely to die in the middle of an episode of Fringe. 

We've had the new tower since Sunday, but Mr. Bill's been tutoring too much to set it up. He's over at my desk doing so as I write, and it's late, and he's been working all day, and I should go over there and convince him to just eat something and go to bed.

But I really want my computer working because his doesn't like Hulu and it's hard to put pictures on and it's at his desk, which is covered with a drift of papers that makes me kind of nervous.

So I'm writing this instead. 

Yay for new computers and husbands that set them up!"

"event","You know what I hate? Arguments. I hate participating in them, I hate being witness to them, I hate how bad I am at them, I hate how hard it is to stop myself from diving into them, even when they are completely stupid and/or don't involve me in any way. It's one of the few things I really, really dislike about living with so many people: it seems like there's always a disagreement going on about <i>something</i>, usually something completely pointless, and usually in the kitchen while I am doing the dishes. I'm always trying desperately to strangle the part of my brain that wants to leap into the middle and tell everyone how they're WRONG <strike>ON THE INTERNET</strike>. This should be easier, considering I'm actually one of the worst debaters in the history of mankind: I cannot keep a clear head, my powers of memory and recall are spotty, and I become physically uncomfortable when locked in a debate. Plus, I have the most annoyingly thorough staircase wit ever so after I disentangle myself from the debate I'll have to spend the next two days thinking of all the things I should have said, the examples I could have used, and the logical fallacies I could have pointed out. Usually I do this during the time I would normally use for sleep. Which makes me very cranky, which impedes my self-control, which makes me more likely to get entangled in more arguments. Lather, rinse, repeat. (In point of fact, I get just as much staircase wit for arguments of which I am not even a part, which is why I so detest having to witness them, even when I manage to stay out of them.)

So it should be easy for me to control myself and stay out of arguments, considering how unpleasant I know I will find it if I don't, but for some reason it's not easy at all. It takes a huge amount of effort, especially when I'm an initial participant and not a bystander. When someone's just said something I strongly disagree with (or strongly disagreed with something I've just said) I <i>know</i> that the best course of action is to shrug it off and redirect the conversation or, if that doesn't work, to flee the scene and let the other party finish doing the dishes as a punishment for being <strike>wrong</strike> contrary. And yet, this is the hardest thing in the world for me to do. It takes up so many of my resources to stay <i>out</i> of an argument that it's almost worse than just diving into the fray and suffering the consequences. Why?? Why do I care? Why can't I make myself stop caring? Why does it take so much effort just to give the outward appearance of not caring? <i>Why, you guys?</i>

In closing, I hate arguments. I may dump a saucepan full of water on the next person to start one within five miles of me. The end."

So what you're saying is that it's okay to flush live fish down the toilet because all drains lead to the ocean and the fish will eventually get home, but it's <i>not</i> okay to throw toys away because they will not only be heartbroken, they will also meet a terrifying, fiery death?

"event","1. <b>Me:</b>Have been having a difficult time achieving a positive mindset of late. Reasons for this include my inability to <i>not</i> catch every single cold virus I encounter and the insane backlog of housework that results from being sick so often. Also, Bear is in the middle of that wonderful stage that all toddlers put their parents through where every attempt to circumvent their will results in a tantrum and every ""no"" must be tested and re-tested to make sure Mama <i>still</i> means it, really, for sure. I may need to have my icon tattooed inside my eyelids or something. Because he really is the most amazing adventure, but it's so easy to get into the habit of considering him the biggest inconvenience ever. 

2. <b>Him:</b> Speaking of His Fourthness, he can now walk, point to his ear (regardless of which body part he is asked to indicate), put his hands together to ""pray,"" and say ""DONE"" as well as the requisite ""Mama"" and ""Dada."" I have pictures and videos, but my computer is off getting itself a new motherboard after frying the old one, and I find Mr. Bill's computer very frustrating to work with, so they'll have to wait.

3. <b>Books:</b> <i>Devices and Desires</i> by K.J. Parker was really good and really big and there's a really big sequel waiting for me under my nightstand. Political intrigue, military tactics, characters that are all flawed and all fascinating. Also, an astounding achievement of world-building. With lots of drama and betrayal and ANGST! <i>Her Fearful Symmetry</i> by Audrey Niffeneggar was...not great. I kept thinking it was going to be, right up until the very end, but then it wasn't, and that made me sad. Fans of <i>The Time Traveler's Wife</i> will, I think, be disappointed in the structure (or lack thereof?) and though the characters are all intriguing, I really hated most of them by the end. I have a hard time enjoying a book when I'm wishing for a freak wildebeest stampede to wipe out everyone in it. <i>The Hunger Games</i> by Suzanne Collins is brutal and perfect, so far. I cannot put it down. Which is a little tricky, considering all the demands on my time. Will report back when I finish it, though I suspect it will only get better: after Mr. Bill read it, he was talking about naming a kid after the main character because she was that awesome.

"event","<b>You are in a small, independent bookstore. You select a book for possible purchase, ask the person manning the counter about the price, and find that it is a little too expensive to justify buying. What is your response?</b>

1. Oh, that's more than I wanted to spend, but thanks.

2. You know, I think my friend has a copy, I should probably just borrow it and save the money.

3. Oh well, maybe later.

4. Why are your books so <i>expensive?</i>

5. I can get it for cheaper at Costco.

6. At the Friends of the Library Bookstore, they sell everything for two dollars or less.


<b>If you chose:</b>

1. You pass! Yay!

2. You pass! Whoo hoo!

3. You pass! Huzzah!

4. You fail. Manners.

5. You fail. We are not Costco. You may have noticed the conspicuous absence of giant containers filled with rice and olive oil. 

6. You fail. We are not the Friends of the Library Bookstore. We are not a tax-exempt entity. Our inventory is (mostly) not donated. Our labor is not free. Neither is our rent. Our books are all cleaned, tagged, and stocked in categories that make them possible to locate. We are open during normal retail business hours. For these reasons and many others, it would be folly for us to attempt to compete with Friends of the Library. 


<b>Bonus question: Is it totally fine if you want to go buy the book somewhere else for less money?</b>

1. Yes, but I'm not going to actually <i>get snippy about it to your face</i> for the following reasons: a) I wasn't raised by wild donkeys, b) there's no reason you need to know since you can't really do anything about the price of the book, and c) it will only make the bookstore owner cranky and cause him to go home and rant about it to his wife for the fifty-seven millionth time.

Well, last night my dream was set in an Orwellian distopia with a faceless Big Brother/INGSOC-esque villain and lots of jackbooted federal thugs. I was part of a resistance movement trying to evade capture by the corrupt government with my team of fellow rebels, who happened to be Booth, Brennan, Angela, and Hodgins from Bones. I don't think my conscious mind could have picked a better group of people to fight The Man with if it tried. We totally kicked butt and no one got captured and subjected to rat torture, though there were a few near misses.

"event","Yesterday and today have been the kind of days that make me so happy that I decided to be a stay-at-home mom.* Various people helped here and there with dishes, so the weight of that chore wasn't as crushing as usual, and the offspring has been a lot more independent about his playtime lately, so I've been getting tons of stuff done while he tools around in the same room with a train or a muffin tin or whatever the toy of the moment is. I had kind of a moment yesterday afternoon when I was making dinner (ratatoille, and it came out splendidly, thank you for asking). 

I was cooking all these beautiful fresh vegetables, the boy was on the other side of the kitchen making happy noises with a pair of spatulas and a colander, and Ernie was in the next room practicing Debussy on the piano. I didn't have the usual crazed laundry-list of things I needed to do eating my brain because I'd already done almost all of them earlier in the day, and I wasn't even tired because the boy's been sleeping really well the past few weeks, and on top of that I'd actually been able to take a <i>nap</i> that afternoon (cue choir of angels and celestial trumpets). So my mind was actually awake and peaceful enough to notice that I was doing <i>exactly what I've always wanted to do</i> at that moment. Everything, the simmering vegetables, the little boy on the floor, and the piano music was all straight out of the fantasies I used to have about being a mom and a homemaker.** 

I was so energized by the ensuing sense of success and well-being that I folded all of today's laundry last night. So when I got up this morning and discovered that I also couldn't go to the bank today as planned (computer out of commission, so can't write receipts for the checks that I was going to deposit) I declared that I was going to take today off. 

So far, I've emptied and filled the dishwasher, make a batch of baby food, cooked and shredded chicken for dinner (albino chili!), and completely rid the kitchen table of cups, newspaper pages, magazines, mail, abandoned flatware, used paper napkins, dishtowels, sweaters, hair accessories, and boxes of cereal that no one could be bothered to put away.

I think I fail at taking a day off.


<small>*Instead of making me wonder what on earth I have gotten myself into and why I thought being Domestic Goddess of the Anderson Abode would be cool.

**This was back before I knew that being a homemaker would, in my case, involve doing dishes for eleven people. </small>"

2. So my plan for the near future is: I'm going to finish reading <i>The Queen of Attolia</i> as quickly as possible without <i>actually</i> neglecting my child or giving up sleep. Then I'm going to read <i>The King of Attolia</i> in the same fashion. Then I'm going to cry because after that, there is no more Eugenides to be had, and my life will be empty and bereft of meaning. Except the part of my life that is spent doing housework and playing with the kid. So...most of my life will still have meaning. But a small part of it will not, and that will make me sad, thus the crying.

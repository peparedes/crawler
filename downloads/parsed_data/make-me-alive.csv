"event","i spent the better part of last night into this morning on this site reading almost all of my old entries.
i still struggle with depression and self esteem issues every day, i'm not sure that it will ever be something i can eradicate from my life entirely.  i've become very good at hiding how i feel.  my ability to wear a mask is the strongest feature i have.  though, admittedly, i am doing SO much better than i was.  as much as my depression is a nuisance, it will always be a part of me and at least when i accept that, i can work on working with it instead of fighting it.  the internal turmoil isn't doing me any good.  though i do really feel like i will never, truly, be happy with myself.  i am the product of my developmental situations.
boys are, annoyingly, still one of the biggest focal points of my ongoing angst.  i wish i could say that i've matured in this regard but i'm still just the little high schooler wondering if he likes me and wondering when he'll call.  just, instead of holding hands, it's gotten a little more... adult.

i feel about myself the way i feel others feel about me.  i have very little internally motivated opinions... which, when you're involved with people who care very little about you, makes it hard to care about yourself."

"event","today was really hard for me emotionally.  school was good.. i'm falling a little behind in one of my classes but i'm pretty confident that i can pull it together and get back on track.  i'm off my pill for 2 weeks, going back on this coming sunday, but so far i'm a hot mess.  i've cried already twice today.  i'm not tired but i want to sleep.  i'm lonely, i'm feeling anxious, i have class in 7 hours and i'm fucking wired.
i want to leave my room... go for a walk... but it's 2am and that seems like an inappropriate reaction to the emotions i'm feeling.
relationship is not so great. i think i'm unhappy... i can't tell what i'm feeling though because my hormones really aren't on point right now.
there's this guy across the hall... we drink wine together and make snappy sarcastic witty comments back and forth. it's what i need right now.. someone who can crack right back and me when i whip... but i'm apparently more damaged by trust issues than i let myself believe.  he had a different girl over tonight, wine, etc.. same M.O. and... what? i get... jealous? really sara? jealous?
he leaves his shades wide open so i can see right into his room... waves at me while she's there. you're not hiding it? should i be weirded out that my vino buddy is vino-ing with some hussy?  should i drop it because realistically i'm the one with the boyfriend having shady dimly lit meetings over glasses of wine?
i'm thinking the latter.

so far, i haven't had an apocalyptic dream for about a week now.  which i'm considering a small success.  we'll see tonight though.

learning about vampires and werewolves in my bizarre behaviors class. it's super interesting

moving off campus next semester with my buddies... either good or bad.  we will find out in the future my friends.

off to bed, i think... maybe some wandering around the dorm first to freak people out... maybe... maybe not.

(also, photography is the shit.  this class is literally consuming my life in the most positive way ever.  i love my teacher, he's FANTASTIC.  we get along.  he has the best sense of humor, he likes my work, i hope some day i can do what i want like he does)"

"event","school life has been getting better. slowly but surely it's getting better. though i feel like i'm clinging to michael too much, seeing as he's probably my best friend up here. i'm very gradually starting to make more friends but it's really hard.
i'll <i>think</i> i'm doing well and then someone will come out and say something obnoxious and rude, someone who i didn't necessarily think was a friend... but not a bitch.
and you know me... shying away from confrontation as i do... but ""why are you here?"" when i'm helping you set up lights for your narcissistic ""photoshoot""? yea, well i would've thought that you would've liked as much external attention as you could've gotten you selfish bitch. i'll leave.

things got better with david and then they got worse again. and now? now we fight on the phone, we barely talk when i'm at school, i see him maybe once a week, and it's not much better when we're actually around each other.  i thought i could get over everything... start new when i said we should start new.
what ended up happening was... like... building a home on the most active fault line in california.  yea, you have a foundation, yea you have a house, a home, but... how strong is that base that you're going off of?
accusations from both sides, trying to trap him... figure out what he's been doing... waiting to catch him in his next lie. it's an awful way to exist in a relationship.
and, if i'm being honest, i'm not totally convinced that he's in this either.

i've been having really weirdly vivid dreams recently... and remembering them in the morning when i wake up.  especially after i've been asleep, wake up, and then go back asleep again.  i have a theory about reactivating cognition mid sleep cycle and how that makes your dreams more realistic and, thus, easier to remember.

testing my theory tonight (been up since about 325 and going back to sleep now at 345)
will leave my journal open for possible dream records in the morning.
goodnight."

"event","what's happened to you?  i only really had like 7 or 8 friends at the most and you were still thriving... at some point you were a happening spot.  sheesh... where'd everyone go?

well, at least i'll still update, mostly for myself, because, as it turns out, i actually use this site as a journal... so that i can recall what's actually happened in my life.  hahahahah

right now, things are still okay.  surprisingly so.  i'm still with they lying cheater lol.  things are going better... although he doesn't want me to be his girlfriend... still.  oh well

since i've turned 21 i've probably drank more than i should've and done pretty dumb things.  but that's okay... for now.  i'm just a slight little fragment worried about the drinking in the future. but right now it's the holiday break and i'm just enjoying my time off and not thinking about what bad i'm doing to my body in the long run.  haha

umm... i've also spent too much money on my las vegas trip and now, for the holidays, i'm just a little bit fucked when it comes to how much i have to spend on the 10 (literally) people that i'm buying presents for.
i've got everyone set except for half of joy's present and... all my friends in camarillo and also half of david's present... but i'm not sure what i'm going to do... for any of them. though i have more time for my friends from school because i'm not even seeing them until the 28th so i can go to the after christmas sales at the mall and try to figure something out. .. hmm... what else?

i broke my camera.
suck
my car was leaking when it was raining.  came back to drive and found a 6 inch puddle on my passenger side floor panel.
double suck
i have no money left.
triple suck

BUT... (even tho he's a lying cheater and i am super uncomfortable and just the slightest bit unhappy) i really like the guy i'm seeing.  when he's nice and sweet and attentive then he's just the greatest. super cute, super sweet.... just wish it had started on a different note to our relationship.  give me a couple months and then we'll see what my entries look like.

my mom is making me this like... graphic journal of my life so far (as part of my birthday present) and i love it... i'm going to try to take pictures of it when it's all done and share it... with my invisible camera... *sigh* i'll just have to use my scanner up at school...

i can't think of anything else cuz i'm a little faded and a little drunk.
more lateR?
i hope."

i know i will be hurt again
i know he will lie to me again

he got all huffy with me but i thought i was getting through to him or that maybe he was listening or was going to open up.
he had lied to me about going to tiffany's thing and he owned up to it but then i straight out asked him if he'd had sex with anyone in the past month and he said no
to my face
while looking me in the eyes.
i told him that if there was anything that he didn't tell me because he thought it would hurt my feelings to just tell me anyway.  that keeping it from me will hurt me more than if he just told me outright.

i've been cheated on before... kinda, i mean, i found out after the relationship was over or something like that... but this fool straight looked me in the eye and told me something that i've now discovered is probably a total lie.

like... severe issues. and i don't let them out because i don't want to seem like the psycho crazy girlfriend who gets jealous all the time. but i do. and then i just internalize it because i feel like i'm overreacting and then i keep getting more and more frustrated in the relationship because i don't trust them and then keep internalizing and over and over and over until i just can't take it anymore
and then all of a sudden i change and things with us change and it's unclear why... but i know... and i still just don't say anything.

how do you explain to someone that you're entirely self conscious and you don't trust them even though there's almost... ALMOST... no reason not to?
except for things like... i know it's the birthday party of a girl at the rancho. i call him, not expecting him to be there and he is... but he... apparently doesn't know that i know that it's her birthday.
oy. this is confusing
tiffany- at the christmas party she and david made out when he was seeing lauren.  huge drama.
it's tiffany's birthday tonight.
they're at the rancho
he told me he went by himself just for fun
didn't mention anything about her birthday party.

why?
i have no idea.
so that's why i say almost.
because, why wouldn't he say that he was there for her party? i just don't get it
those stupid little lies that aren't really lies but are just... stupid. withholding information? i guess that's what it is
i just don't understand lying at all.

last night was cold and sweet and rolling around in the sheets and cuddling. we never cuddle. it was comfort. today? it's lying and secrets and distance.
i'm back at school. i'm trying to have trust and faith that things are... well... the way that i'd like them to be. but i have no security. no assurance. no proof that things are.

i don't want to feel like i'm on eggshells. pins and needles.  i've just started to open up that cabinet in my chest. that one that was locked for so long. collecting dust. don't make me slam it shut. it hurts when the pressure is re-engaged. when i hole myself up again. please don't.

i don't trust you. and it's bizarre because usually that's because i don't trust myself. that i project my issues onto your personality. not this time. why should i trust you when i have been told time after time that i shouldn't? that there's something else to this. to you. there's someone else. with you.
i'm gone so often. so much of the time.
we have fun. i was just starting to not listen to everyone else. to block it out. you made me think... i made myself think.
one should never feel as though they aren't allowed to initiate. that i feel as though every single, every SINGLE time i try to talk to you that i will appear needy. that i will appear weak.
and, why don't i think it's okay? to show you that i want you.

this is what happens when i only update once every couple of months.  i have this extended bipolarity. it's awesome
so right now, i just got home from moving half of my stuff into my new dorm.  i have 3 suite mates. it should be interesting this next semester.
i got home from my amazing vacation on monday.
we left on the 2nd to miami fl, got on the cruise ship and went on a caribbean cruise
day 1. ""fun day at sea"" aka... sleep in and hang out in the pool
day 2. Grand Cayman- swam with a dolphin named newton held baby turtles at the turtle farm. it was an amazing day
day 3. Isla Roatan- went to a fantastic beach called West Bay.  on the way we saw and got to play with a white faced monkey named Jasmine.  she licked my arm and was adorable.  then went and had drink in the clear ocean water and floated along.  it was pretty amazing
day 4. Belize- CAVE TUBING. fucking awesome. hiked through the jungle in belize to get the the start of a cave system. relaxing and floating through these amazing natural rivers. then, swinging off a tarzanesque rope swing and splashing back down into the refreshing water. really, truly, amazing.
day 5- Cozumel- Snorkeling in the national park with all the little fishies and then going to a private beach with a water trampoline and slide and rock climbing wall and amazing clear water and spectacular fun.
day 6- another ""fun day at sea"" mostly sleeping in and recovering from the wicked colds that we had
and then returning back to miami the next morning.  headed out to maryland the next day to spend 4 days with my uncle bill and aunt shirley and cousin bruce and crazy bitch wife of his and their adorable kids (ben emma and isabelle)
then off to new york to spend more time with bill and shirley but also with my cousin eleanor and francisco and their two fantastic and even more adorable kids adrian (3) and cecilia (6 months)
i loved all the time i spent with them and felt very family oriented and connected.

there's this new boy. who i do NOT trust but am falllling for... or, i'm half falling for him and half just totally annoyed by him. he's a player. he doesn't drive. he's spent time in jail. there are definite faults... but then there's all the times he's sweet and attentive and amazing and cute and cuddly and the sex is... mind blowing and i can't just let it be that... i've tried to just say that's that and that's that and leave it but i can't... it doesn't work so well for me.
anyways. more on that that later. maybe. hahaha we'll see.
so far. he's nice and all that when i'm with him. then he doesn't talk to me when we're not together. he doesn't initiate contact. i feel like i'm intruding when i do. i'm nervous around him so i don't talk much. we don't talk much... wow, writing this all down i'm really thinking it's not all i've cracked it up to be.
sleep now, i'd rather not think about it"

"event","was pretty awesome.  it looked kinda like it was going to suck (we're redoing out house right now. painting and tiling and bannisters and more tiles... and it looked like my mom was going to 'forbid' me to go on vacation and stay and help with the house. BUT
i ended up going to mexico for the 20th to the 24th. which was pretty fun... with a few exceptions of mean boys and accidental frustration based on a silly kiss. overall lots of off-roading, coronas, and sun.  very relaxing.
after i came back i stayed at matt's place on that night but went home the next morning... went to six flags with matt on the 26th which was pretty fun cuz it wasn't hardly crowded at all.  we didn't get to go on X2 tho which was a little disappointing but still not long lines for rides.
then on the 27th i left for big bear til the 29th with cecci and her bf and a couple other couples which was pretty random cuz there was just me and this other guy and i didn't know if i was supposed to... sit next to him? or... what? so we ended up being futon buddies and it was fun too... again, lots of beer... and hot tubs :) and flaming dr. peppers and irish car bombs (which DON'T taste like milkshakes... don't let them fool you)

thennnn... sun after we got back travis, cecci, matt, and i went out to dinner which was also nice once the little bit of drama that occurred round it was done.
andddd then i had work tues night and now i'm back at school in camarillo satisfied with the break but tres sad that it's over.
it reminded me how much i like to be lazy and not work or go to school and just travel and hang out... *sigh*

also, i found out today that i DIDN'T bomb that midterm like i thought i did... i got an 83% which is awwwwesome. so i won't be failing that class after all! woohooooo"

fml.
boooo



so now i'm up at 245 just getting done studying for biostatistics and getting everything in order for my art midterm... which is apparently harder than we all thought it was gonna be...
then to argue with my mother about if i can actually GO on vacation or not.
take the midterm.
go to a museum and do the same damned museum project i've done over and over and over and over and over again for all of the years i've been in art classes (i get it... museums are awesome and you want to make sure we understand the true awesomeness of it... kthanks. i don't have to write countless essays on the same boring ass art criticism shit... how does the artist use line and color and contrast? with your mom. that's how.)

a little bugged out right now.  perhaps i should go to bed.
i do have class in the morning.
that should be fuuuuuun.
i'd really love it if i could go out and blow off steam on my spring break without feeling like i would be kidnapped raped and killed. that'd be cool."

"event","been super depressed lately
school and home and work and no social life.
i think making the decision to live alone was the wrong one.  i'm very alone for much too much of the day.  i don't go out to make friends because i don't like the people here.  they're all the same and they're all annoying.  i'm not being pretentious or anything.  some of them are nice i guess it's just that, if i had the choice, out of all the types of people in the world (excluding serial killers and rapists etc) the type of people here would be at the top of my list of people to not spend time with.
i liked my suitemate last year... and her bf and their friends.  we might room together in anacapa next year, if she wants to.  but she's like... straight edge. which isn't a fault in a human being but i'd really rather a chill roommate who i can get drunk with and smoke a bowl with and hang out.  i'd feel too guilty if i converted her.  she's rather nice.  my classes are going okay so far, we're only in week 4? i think... maybe week 5.  my hardest class for me is my life drawing class... she has a very specific style of how to do figures because she has an animation background and she thinks i try to hard to draw ""pretty drawings""...
that's just how i function lady. aight? i don't draw boxes and cylinders for people... i draw people. sue me

home is whatever. my mother seems to worry and stress out about EVERYTHING.  the other day... when it was raining my brother was in the kitchen and his shoe squeaked and she freaked out and asked him if he was okay.  then he left for work... and it started to pour... so she called him on the phone to make sure he wasn't dead because he was driving in the rain.  mort falls asleep and she'll wake him up to make sure he's not dead.  i had a bump on my head and she wanted to take me to the doctor.
i love her. but it's fucking annoying as hell.

coralea dumped me as her friend. she took me off her myspace page... like, defriended me omg. right?
because i was 'hurting morgan'
now, morgan and i are still friends and coralea still doesn't talk to me.
becca told me yesterday that  she can't be my friend because of her history with my brother.
cecilia has been down lately which means that she takes it out on me and so now she's not talking to me and doesn't want to spend any time with me.
matt d is basically my closest friend right now and he ditched me the other night to go out drinking with his buddies and then blamed it on me.
friend repeller.
that's me.
so, not only am i not making friends here but i'm also losing all my close friends from home. greeeeaaaatttttt"

"event","so. i applied to be on that program LAink... i didn't think they'd call me back. but they did, now i have an interview next week to be on the show.
i also applied to be a suicide girl thinking they'd DEF not respond... but they did.
i don't really know what i was thinking.  that's not a good idea.
LAink isn't so bad tho... because it's essentially just a tattoo... on tv. which isn't a problem.  but sg??? seriously???
i feel like... maybe i was just looking to get validated because i've been feeling like a fat cow... which i am :)
i went to the doctor the other day and i've LITERALLY gained 20lbs since high school.
that's disgusting. and it shows. and it's disgusting.
like.... really. really disgusting.
you know those people who walk down the street and you're like... awww. what a shame... i bet she would be so pretty if she lost weight.
that's me.
hahahaha
so yesterday i decided that i was going to start working out again.  it shouldn't be hard to lose about 10 of those pounds... it's like when you're obese and the first 10 or so pounds are easy to lose. actually it's exactly like that.
sooo what i'm doing is when i'm at work i do all the running around from table to table or car to car doing the delivery stuff. i carry all the chairs/highchairs and shit like that so i get the slightest bit of cardio when i'm at work.  (which probably totals up to like... 10 mins a day) which is not enough so i'm also working out when i'm at school in my room... because i don't know where the gym is. hahahaha.  i'm trying to get hints off of like... youtube to see if maybe someone has some awesomely amazing workout moves that you can do in a small space without equipment.
then maybe when i lose the back roll and the elephant arms i'll do the sg thing.  i don't think there's a time limit so i can wait til i don't hate myself :-D

wow. i'm quite down on myself today.
ummmm.... on a different note i've been seeing this guy... kinda. we just kinda hang out and... do stuff. hahaha. but we're not actually together (quel suprise) i work with him.  he's 33 which is so typical of me but to my credit he looks like he's 23. he told me the other day that he doesn't want me to see anyone else or be with anyone else... but that he still wants to be able to do that.
and i told him to f-off and that wasn't going to happen.  that i'm not down for hypocrisy and that if he's going to expect that he can see other people that he damn well better expect that i will too.  and then he told me that he liked spending time with me blah blah blah BUT that he didn't want to ""date"" or be ""together"" because of his daughter (i knew about her... we get along which is nice).  but i guess he wants someone who's not closer to his daughter's age. hahahahahahaha.  it was like... nice but a stab at the same time.  but the physical is great so i'm not quite done with this one yet.

i got ""promoted"" at work so now i'm training to do take out (woo). hahaha i wish it was like a super awesome promotion at a major company so i'd be making a grip of money but it's not like that at all unfortunately.  i just get like... a dollar raise and much more tips... and handle food/customers instead of just customers.  and i feel really lame but i'm TOTALLY excited about it. hahaha.  so hopefully soon i won't be so broke because i'll be getting dolladolla bills ya'll.  yea... you can roll your eyes. :)
what else.... umm... school is nice...  i still haven't really made any friends because i'm... um... shy... or something.
and the guy from last semester keeps texting me asking where his ""birthday present"" is.  which is annoying but like... okay at the same time.
my classes are pretty sweet.  but i have a lot of down time which is why it would be nice to actually have some friends.  i'm in class on monday starting at 130-245 and 6-9 then tues and thurs from 9-12 and wed only from 130-245.  and then i have one online class... but i discovered i don't have the discipline for an online course. so i think it'll be my last one.  i'm taking critical thinking (which is my favorite class because it's an interactive class essentially talking all about diversity/class/racism/economy... it's awesome we just sit around and talk about really interesting stuff), drawing and composition with this awesome french guy.  but we haven't really gotten into the super cool party of the class yet... we're just doing line/contour drawing... ummm american sign language which i think is going to be awesome... and then the computer human interaction class... online.  which had the potential to be sooooo interesting but it FAILED.
although, i only have a final in ONE OF MY CLASSES WOOOOO.
hahaha it's awesome
so before this becomes unbearably long i think i'll end this post.
wish be luck on not being the like... 60% of america that's obese :)"

"event","it's been a while. something about summer and blogging.

i've written a couple of times in my myspace blog but it's still not the same.
right now i'm just trying to get adjusted to the fact that i'm leaving again for school fairly soon.  which means i'll be all aloney loney loney again.  i really should start making some friends up there.

after starting work at CPK i realized i love it.  not necessarily the job so much... but i'm quite fond of the people i work with.  i think i' ll miss going in to work during the week.  although, i'll be back on the weekends some.  i guess we'll see :)

i went thorough a period of time where i had been very depressed again.  i felt like i had no true friends, nobody to talk to.  i was out of therapy (still am) but wanted to go back.  just so i could get some of the shit i was dealing with off my chest.  it's like, everyone should have that one person who they can tell anything to.  big or small... insignificant or life changing.  the one person who i thought i had like that ended up telling me that the problem was all my fault, i should get over it, and ditched me in vegas.  no lie. we were leaving the next morning so the car ride was awkward.  we're still talking and she believes we're the best of friends but things can't just go back to being normal on this side for me.  so i basically had nobody to talk to.  nobody to bitch about my bad day at work or talk about the fact that my family is financially fucked.  it sucked.  it still does... but i'm getting used to it i guess.  i have the number for a good therapist but i haven't gotten the courage up to call her.  something about how much she charges i feel like i should have bigger issues.  i'm not good enough for therapy. lol

i've somehow managed to surround myself with very critical minded people.  engineers.  there's not a lot of feeling and a ton of criticism towards any feeling because it's a ""weakness""... right? uh. no.
i'm sorry but being in touch with yourself is a CRUCIAL part of being a HUMAN BEING.  that's the difference between humans and machines no?  you can make a machine talk and work and build and engineer.  it's so frustrating.
this guy who i've been seeing is the epitome of a redneck engineer.  if you can imagine that.  he has no feelings, judges my feelings, thinks that he knows all the answers and always has to be right (whenever i use all encompassing words... i'm not exaggerating).  he likes guns and violence and is a republican.  he hunts. he drives a huge truck and has a chopper.
i told him i didn't want to be his girlfriend anymore... but i wanted to still be friends... cuz that's the kind of girl i am.  he told me that if we weren't dating he didn't want to be in contact with me... basically.
so for the past couple of months we've been seeing each other but not seeing each other.  spending a lot of time, as if we were still dating exclusively, but not having titles.  at least on my side.  for him i think it's different.
i'm over at his house right now and this was supposed to be us talking.  i got here a little later than i had intended last night and we ended up driving to hollywood to pick up a beer pong table... can home... and went to sleep because he had to be up for work at 7 in the morning... he's still gone.

so much for talking.

i'm pretty much rambling now... and i think this post is too long.
sorry"

"event","my first ""year""/first semester is officially over tomorrow!!!!!
i'm super excited because i am getting fairly good grades.
if i managed to pull off As on my finals i'll get a 4.0.  although right now that seems highly unlikely
oh well i'll still get a high-ish gpa.
i'm still with my bf.  it's been... 6 months but we don't celebrate anniversaries.  i like celebrating one month... and two month... i really like doing those things but... i don't know.  we didn't talk about it and it never happened so we don't.

oh well.  he was married for 7 years and has a kid.  i'm pretty sure he's over the celebrating monthly anniversaries.
i'm having some trouble with him and us tho.
stuff that's been bugging me for a while.
he's a nice enough guy but we have NOTHING in common... not one thing. it's cool because i get to learn about other stuff like... dirt bikes... and shit like that but when it comes to us doing stuff i might like it's not really... taken well. 
he's an engineer so any other major that isn't mechanical engineering is stupid and unnecessary.  and EASY... apparently... so i'm never as smart as or working as hard as he is.
he's always busy.  a call at 11:30 pm is all he can afford in a day to talk to me.
he thinks he knows everything about my family and what i should do with my life.  but he doesn't know anything.  he judges my mother's parenting skills.  he thinks my brother is lazy and isn't going to do anything with his life.  which isn't true or his fucking place to say ANYTHING about.
i don't ask for much in a relationship.  just mutual appreciation and understanding and a small amount of time.  how hard is that to ask?
why do i only hear from him in the day at the very end of the night... with just barely enough time before i go to bed?
he says he's busy and that if i'm not okay with that then maybe we should break up.  it's not that i'm not okay with him being busy it's just that i'm not okay with not hearing from him.  i don't know.  if you're used to talking to someone every day for 6 months and then all of a sudden they just... don't care anymore... or at least it seems like he doesn't care/isn't making the effort.  i told him it kinda bugged me when he doesn't call and i always have to initiate conversation. like... how hard is it to pick up the phone for a minute and say 'i'm busy but i wanted to say hi'
thats all

oh well.
i think it's also worsened by the fact that i literally have a list.. okay maybe it isn't literal... but there's all these guys that i'm super attracted to right now and it's making it really hard to want to be in a relationship with anyone, let alone someone i'm not compatible with.

*sigh*
at least classes are going well :)"

"event","chico, monterey bay, and channel islands
those are pretty much my final three
monterey bay i would be able to go in the fall of this year (if i got accepted)
aaaaaaaand that would rock
the other two i would have to wait til spring 08 cuz i can't even apply right now

i would've loved to go to a UC with rachel or becky...
but... sara was retarded in high school and didn't complete some critical core classes for getting into a UC and i don't have the patience to stay at a CC to get the requirements because it would take two years at least. (yes i am talking about myself in the 3rd person.)

anyways i went on a road trip with my mom and mort and we went and visited chico and monterey bay which were VERY nice.
i think i fell in&nbsp; love with chico because it's like going to school in the woods. except it was annoyingly hot and the guy giving the tour said that there are mosquitos.
which i could get over... obviously
i liked monterey bay too cuz it was right next to the ocean, it's closer to home, you don't have to share a bathroom with an entire city practically, and the dorm rooms are big...er. bigger than any other dorm rooms i've seen.
um... everyone was nice everywhere i went.
mort and joy hardly fought
we went to big sur and morrow bay and all these wonderful places on the way home.
it was a fantastic time.

now i just have to apply to the last two places... wait to hear back from monterey bay ... and then make my final decision.
i'm sad to say that this is the most important thing in my life right now.
no love life
work is boring.
i haven't had sex in 3 months
and i hate that.
hahahaha
i hardly ever to out to clubs or parties anymore.
i haven't been working out
i've been gaining weight.
blah blah blah
the usual shit.

but i am kinda excited for college... so, go figure.&nbsp; i was so against doing anything for it at first.&nbsp; i'm so afraid of being alone in a new place far away from home where i don't know anyone.&nbsp; i'm so shy and it's so hard for me to make friends.&nbsp; i kept thinking 'why the hell would i want to go to college? why the hell would i want to put myself in a situation where i know i'm going to be scared and alone for a long time?&nbsp; where i wouldn't be anywhere close to my family?'
i don't care, i'll admit it, i'm a mommas girl... i'm SO fucking close to my mom... and i'm so scared of leaving... but i think it will be a good growth opportunity for me so i'm willing to give it a shot... if i hate it i'll come home and live in the basement til i'm 45... people do that right? hahahahahaha

yeaaa.... not so much.
anyway i'm going to stop before this gets way too long, which it probably already is...
if you read this... thanks... if not, then you wouldn't be reading this.

"event","i quit my job.&nbsp; i'm looking for a new job...

i've been going to the gym about 5-6 days a week and it feels great although i've only lost 5 pounds (my tl is at least 35lbs less and my il 50)
so i'm working on it...

i'm thinking i have to do something else.&nbsp; i've cut out all white foods (white bread, pasta, potatoes, and white rice) because they process through as sugar... i've cut my portions in half.&nbsp; i try to count my calories... but i don't know it still seems too slow.
i don't drink juice or soda except for maybe once a week and i snack on fruits instead of chocolate or potato chips or something.

i just want it to go faster....

but i don't know what would do that.
probably working out more... more time on the machines... going twice a day... that kind of thing.


ummm... other than that everything else sucks.....
and that's not even that good.
so there...."

um... new years eve was okay.

my resolutions...
use my gym membership more (i've been starting to go)
go to clubs more (since i am actually now 18 and can go to some)
figure out how to balance my friends my boyfriend and my work
quit my job and find one that pays more than 7.35 because that's a pathetic salary

blah blah blah
um.... i'm sick and i've been missing a lot of work lately. but i want to quit anyway i just can't quite figure out how... i think i'll quit tomorrow. if i have enough courage.
i was going to wait til my 6 month evaluation before i did that... whichc should be coming up because usually they give you a raise at that point but they'd have to give me over 2 dollar raise for me to feel as though it was worth it for me to stay and i doubt that they'll do that.

christmas was okay.um.... i had this whole shpeel that i was going to say and i totally forgot it all... oh well... i'll update again if i remember"

this doesn't sound like much in the abriviated form. but i'm quite overwhelmed right now
i'm working my ass off
i'm going to school.

i'm sure you'll probably read this and just thought you should know.
i'm angry but i don't blame you.





i broke up with sal... he went to a rave and hooked up with someone else. and it hurts... a lot
spiteful? maybe...

on a different note i went out with coralea on saturday night and had so much fun doing absolutely nothing.&nbsp; it was great.&nbsp; i've missed her
yesterday i worked and then went shopping and became extreemely depressed because i'm fat.
then today is my day off, i'm going out to lunch with morgan and then going to discuss my tattoo plans (yey!!!!!!!!)
and then possibly going shopping again with mike so i can make myself feel even worse.
because i have 0 self esteem and like... 2 points of happy.
go me!
hahaha oh well
i've gotta go get ready to go out and eat like the pig i am.
although i did 95 sit ups this morning.

i'm on the right fucking track.

i miss having fun time
i miss not being so damn... sad

"event","so i'm in ohio.
i had a fight with sal right... RIGHT before i left.
which sucked...
but whatever i guess
i sat in on a class today and took a tour of the campus (in the SNOW i might add)
and it was really amazing
everyone was nice
they only serve vegan/vegitarian/healthy food
and have a gym
which to me = losing weight (muahahaha hooray)
so far i've been having a ton of fun
although, again, i wish i could have left with sal on a good note

but my family and i have been getting along sorta well so far
we all went to hooters last night and got wings from the dumbest blonde girl in ohio....

i'm really tired from traveling all day yesterday and i had to get up really REALLY early because of the time change to get to the schoool on time and we got lost so i was still 2 hours late.
oh well




also- i had my first photoshoot on... um... i don't know... a couple weeks ago maybe... i'm still waiting on the pictures to come back but i'm pretty excited just so i can completely critique them and see what's wrong with me ;)
hahaha no so i can work on my body when i've got all my energy back and can pull my shit together to start working out.&nbsp; (my brother had a falling out... or got fired or something happened with the gym so i'm not going there anymore.&nbsp; and i kinda stopped dancing which i hate but it's so hard to compete with matt and mike............ so i feel a little bad about that but... eh
i'll work on it
on myself
and i'll be aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll better
lol
um. i'm going to go take a nap and watch independence day...
i''ll update more later

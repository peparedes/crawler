"event","&nbsp;well this last week has been pretty crazy because of all the fires... on monday the company i work for sent down a strike team of 4 ambulances to help evacuate hospitals and con homes in san diego and i worked overtime trying to get supplies together for our strike team and keeping all the kous undercontrol to some extent at least... i left work on monday stressed and overworked and i went to meet beth at the VFW that we hang out at sometimes, when i get there she has been drinking so i dont feel i can talk to her about my day although she isnt drunk or anything....and&nbsp;this leaves me&nbsp;feeling like she isnt fulfilling her duties of being supportive and she doesnt think im filling mine either, she is upset because she came to the realization that i do have a some what dangerous job and i wanted to be right there on the front lines with all the other EMT's that got to go help... no mater what i tried to say i felt helpless there was no way i was going to be able to calm her fears and this totally frustrated me.... anyway we met the next day and talked about it and worked it out but it was a really tense couple days.&nbsp;

on another note we are going to go watch SAW IV tonight i am so excited... im sure it will not disappoint"

"event","so on wednesday beth tells me that she wants to take me to a place on thursday night and its a surprise... i'm thinking cool, that's so sweet, i'm glad she is taking initiative and thinking of nice things for us to do and so on and so forth... then i start thinking about it more and i kinda start freaking because i don't know where i'm going and she won't tell me anything except that i need to wear something nice and that she thinks&nbsp;that i will really like it... than i start thinking but we have only been dating for 6 weeks thats not that long and i don't know if she knows me well enough to pick a place she ""knows"" i will like.... this nonsensical thinking went on until thursday night&nbsp;

i arive more than a little weary at her house with dress pants, shirt and shoes in tow... we eat dinner and then change to go out to the mystery place... i have calmed some now because she has assured me so many times how much she think i'll like the place... and then i scare the shit out of her by telling her that i can't lie and that if i don't like it i will be unable to not show it... which is the truth but perhaps this was a bad time to reveal this tidbit

when we arrive at the place its a jazz bar called the Hip Kitty... i see it from a block away and instantly get excited because i have always wanted to got to a jazz bar... i love jazz music it i think is my favorite genre if i had to pick one... and to top it off&nbsp;their specialty is&nbsp;fondue.... so we&nbsp;walk in and instantly i am in love with this place, it is like stepping back in time and the music is phenominal... so we sat at a spot at the bar and had drinks and enjoyed the music and&nbsp;fed each other an assortment of chocolate goodies.... at that moment i was the happiest i have ever been in such a long time.... now don't get me wrong i have been very happy with beth and i enjoy all the time i have spent with her but this&nbsp;was the best time so far... and it was the most romantic thing&nbsp;anyone had ever done for me!

so i was proven wrong and all of my fears and freaking were totally unwarranted, and i now have a greater trust in beth and her ability to listen.... and this only allowed all my feelings for her&nbsp;to cement more.&nbsp;"

"event","ok&nbsp; so here goes my first entry... this could get weird...&nbsp;
currently i am sitting across from my girlfriend and looking into her beautiful eyes, her soulful eyes, feeling a type of pull to a person i just havent felt in years... it is an awesome feeling it is engulfing and nearly indescribable... i have a peace and grounded aura where im around her... although i feel her hesitation for somethings i am grateful for the fact that she has pushed her boundaries so far to spend time with me and to do enjoyable things.... this kind of sacrifice is the greatest kind in my mind... i don't think she even can fathom the appreciation that i have and how much it means to me.... when i have feelings of doubt or insecurity i think of these things and i'm reassured"

"event","I'm Kristin and this is my zombie story.

I got to thinking, though. Stories are a thing of the past, told over roaring campfires with moths and bears, neither of which I'm particularly fond of. What we need for this zombie story - one set fully in the modern age and told through the eyes of three slightly normal young adults - is something new. Something to appeal to a lot of different senses and activities, not just reading. It needs to be multi-media, it needs to be.. well, awesome. Multi-awesome. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out a way to appeal to your senses of smell, taste, or touch yet. Give me a bit, I'm working on it.

This multi-awesome thing is, unfortunately, going to have to be friends' locked, due to the nature of some of the multi-awesomeness. Yarr, avast ye mateys, shiver me timbers. Get it? Got it? Good.

<lj-cut text=""Rules. Really simple."">

1. The writing belongs to me. Most of the pictures, music, etc. do not.
2. If you want to read, friend the journal and comment to this entry. Be sure to tell me who you heard about this from, so I'll know you're cool.
3. Also, some of the music/images might cease to work. Comment here if they do, so I can reupload or find out what the problem is.
4. Your mom.

Why South Park graphics?
Because I can't effing draw, that's why. :P

That's all. Oh, I thought I should put this here: I promise to you guys that all of the images here will be safe-for-work. And you can trust me, because I'm trustworthy like that."

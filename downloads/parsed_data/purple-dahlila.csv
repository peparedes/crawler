I guess both good and bad.&nbsp; But the most important thing is that Cam and I are still together. Its been around 10 months now and a year in may. minus like a month that we werent together. I am so happy with it right now. Everything has been going great. We'v been through so much. We can basically get through anything now. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ive had 3 job so far in my short life. I quit 2 of them, and recently got fired from my most recent one. Its retarted though. They had no good reason. Plus it was really hard cause i was only working weekends at 6 in the morning. It sucked so bad. Now i applied at slipperys. Hopefully I can get it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well...I think thats about it...well, all that I can say for right now. I know like no one reads this but oh well...I wanted something to do. lol.

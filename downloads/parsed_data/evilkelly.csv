Let me tell you if i just had a few less problems in my life thaings would be a hell of a lot better. Another thing that kinda ticks me off is that most people just don't understand how well they have things.  Some people are just either to oblivious, stupid or concited to know... but n-e way it's really none of my bussiness to bitch about it huh? even thought i don't fall i nthe n-e of those catagores lol."

comment to be added, but DON'T ask me to add you if:
- you want to make your friends list look longer
- you can't type correctly. i.e. ""u"" is NOT you, and no diz, wif, lolz, kewl, any of those words. LEARN TO SPELL, PEOPLE.
- be intrested in what i have to say. don't tell me what i think is wrong, and don't tell me what i write is stupid. if you don't like it, get the fuck out.
- look at my userinfo. if we have at least 5 things in common, then comment. if we have nothing in common, give me a reason why i should add you. [but chances are, i'll add you anyways. we'll find some common ground sooner or later.]

<b>if i decide to add you, you will be in a week or sooner. </b>

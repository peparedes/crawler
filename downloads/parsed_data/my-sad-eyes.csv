"event","The wind through the trees almost brings me to my knees.
I sat here today mistaken for another throbbing pain.
It reads like a textbook boring and dull where no one wants to open something that is beauty and full.  Oh how can the trees bend with the wind today and not say a word to me?  My eyes are tense and my head full of dispense.  Why is it sunny outside and rainy where ever I rest.  The wind blows fierce and through my pain it does pierce.  The beauty of it all is that I can still find strength to stand proud and tall."

Cob webs and hollow space is what you'll find
My heart has drained every last thought
You may see straight through this place you've been brought.
A black empty space
With storms of disgrace
There are puddles deeper then this
A shallow and blank obis.
A skull of a dead earthen body
That shrieks out at night for anybody.

Holy hellacious I forgot my name.
Flip flop flippety flop.
A mouse ran up the clock?
Hmmm I don't think that is right.
It's a bird, It's a plane.
Everyone just sit tight.
Not possible.
It's a twista, it's a twista auntie Emm.
Oh my I don't think we are in Kansas anymore...Ah man!!
Mixed mashed confusion.
A twilight zone making me dizzy.
Good gracious and bodacious.
Whompy whompy kallawag.
Boy someone should have given me a name tag.

I hate hell.  And let me tell you a little bit about this.  Corruption and a way to fix it?  I sit and I ponder, but this could restrain me for unknown purposes such as those things that they put on packaging.  I think they call them labels with nutrition facts.  Well, if I was concerned about being healthy, I wouldn't be sitting here eating a whole bag of Tostido's lime chips and a pint of ice cream.  I think they are there to help you make sure you eat the required calories to keep this curvy flabby figure.  Okay so I ate the package too.  And if I was a car I would have a lot of mileage on me.  Something to think about next time someone takes me for a ride.  Few!  It is storming OUTSIDE!  I was afraid that it would follow me in here.  I hope I don't have a nightmare tonight.  I really don't feel like changing the sheets tomorrow.  Oh Wow!  Speaking of tomorrow, are we really sure it will be there?  I mean I asked knealing before God on Sunday in church.  Do we have any other options?  Shouldn't laughter grow on trees and love in the bushes?  I think we should all have sand between our toes and water in our eyes.  Should peace be on our lips and our tongues dull?  Or should we all just become and remain corrupt and go to jail?

Why do I always find the guys that are jerks?
The ones who tend to wear the smirks.
The sleaze and the oh baby please.
You are such a tease.
I hate how smug you are.
I can tell you now you aren't going to get very far.
You'll get what is coming due.
Oh boy I feel sorry for you.
A fling a commitment they never know what they want.
I think it is time for me to be blunt.
It is all bullshit and you make me sick.
I'm glad I found out early that you are a prick."

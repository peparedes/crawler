"event","Sorry, everyone, my journal is now friends only. Livejournals aren't for parents. Sometimes parents think they are being sneaky by trying to read their kid's online journal, but really that is childish and petty. So if you want to have something to do with my personal life besides snooping around to find something to ground me for, comment and I'll probably add you."

"event","As posted on the forum before it went down, Pink Blush will be closed indefinitely. Lorraine can no longer pay for the hosting, and we have not been successful in re-mounting the database on another server, and neither of us really have the time to admin anymore.

Thanks to everyone who made the forum such a success and so fun, we would have liked to keep providing it but the time and money simply became too much. We are sorry!

You can still add me (Nimue) on MSN (pixel.nimue at hotmail), or on Deviantart (atacuivel), I am always happy to chat with former PB'ers.

"event","I've just sent in a ticket and I'm waiting on a response. I'm getting quite frustrated too guys...very frustrated. 

Ok they've sent me a reply and told me that the third party reseller is giving them problems and they will be moving us to another server as soon as ours is back online. Blah.

"event","grrrr just so you know, I've beenin contact with the helpdesk of my site and they've told me that someone was abusing resources on teh server and they disconnected and they are waitinf for someone to reconnect it. I emailed them again a couple hours ago and asked them how much longer they thought it would be and they are still waiting for them to reconnect and they will be moving those of us on that server to one of their servers because of this. So hopefully we'll be back soon...hopefully. meh.

"event","My server is down all around for the first time since I've used this host. Now there is no need to panic as this is the first time and usually regardless of where you are hosted, you're bound to have some technical problems. 

So hang-tight, we'll be back soon!

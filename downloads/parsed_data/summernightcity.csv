I'm serious about this, so please, humor me and read this. kthx.

[.001] If I know you, just comment with your name. If I'm confused about you and can't figure you out from your profile {you be the judge}, let me know how I know you.
[.002] If I don't know you, that's cool too. Just let me know how you found me and what we have in common and I'll get back to you.
[.003] Generally I'm pretty fast about online stuff, so if I've already added you, ignore your introductory comment.
[.004] I like to bitch. Just thought I'd get that out there.
[.005] I'd prefer it if you didn't reply with a ""omg huh?""-type comment if I'm being cryptic. I like being cryptic, so deal with it. I also hate explaining things, call it a major pet peeve. Just take a look, I bet I've stated whatever's in question before, and quite possibly recently.

Got all that? You sure? All right, have fun!"

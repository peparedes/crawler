"event","Hello and welcome to the journal for my actual comic, Just Grand. This is nto really going to be anything liek the other stuff i posted before. This will actually be well drawn. and it will have a plotline. for the next few days the only posts will be pictures of each character. also ill be workign with the style of this journal so it will look good. check back tomorrow for the first character. his names larry, and yes thats intentianally rhymed with my name. he is based on me only in opinions and somewhat in looks. any shit that happens to him has nothign to do with what happens to me. his love interests arent mine, etc. wel check back soon.

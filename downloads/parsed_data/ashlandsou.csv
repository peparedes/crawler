"event","1. What did you do in 2009 that you'd never done before?
Became a father, and all things related to that. Believe it or not, I had never given a diaper change before Sophia.

2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?
My new years resolution for ought nine was to build savings even while having a baby. Yes, I did keep that resolution. The goal is to make 2010 the year we eliminate credit card debts.

3. Did anyone close to you give birth?
Many people did. Seems being pregnant brought an awareness of everyone else who was pregnant. None more special or important than Amanda, though.

4. Did anyone close to you die?.
No.

5. What countries did you visit?
Went to Washington in October&hellip; J

6. What would you like to have in 2010 that you lacked in 2009?
That&rsquo;s tough. I&rsquo;ve seen so many people in such need this last year. We are very well off by most standards, so this is difficult to think of. I would like to have an HAS account that is building in size, rather than being constantly in debt to myself.

7. What dates from 2009 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?
February 15, and February 28. Sophia&rsquo;s due date, and her actual birthday. The events of February 28, though&hellip; I will never forget that day from waking up early to getting set up in the hospital to watching Flip that House type shows, to Jet arriving/lunch to the long afternoon into the evening, all the visits with doctors, Charm (our good luck charm), the very quick prep for surgery, Sophia&rsquo;s actual birth, the hours spent in the nursery, the last hour of the day spent in the hospital room with Amanda and Sophia, eating the Subway sandwich Andrew brought.

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?
Budgeting for, saving for, researching, and purchasing our new computers. I&rsquo;m very proud of how well I did with that.

9. What was your biggest failure?
There were plenty of little things. Not filling out greeting cards in a timely fashion.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?
Minor bumps and bruises medically throughout the year. Most notable: swine flu. Honorable mention goes to the dental work I had done in January.

11. What was the best thing you bought?
The computers. Honorable mention to our camcorder.

12. Whose behavior merited celebration?
No one more so than Amanda, who handled the late parts of pregnancy (version, ahem!) and the transition to motherhood wonderfully. Seriously, who works full time and still has the energy and motivation to *make* baby food? I mean it when I say not a day has gone by in which I have not found myself deeper in love with her this year.

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?
There have been certain co-workers. Some I can talk about here, others I cannot. I&rsquo;d rather not though. The behaviour has ranged from laziness to lying to cheating to public urination. Not the kinds of things I want to dwell on when I am in such a good place.

14. Where did most of your money go?
Baby-related expenses. If I were to make a guess, probably either formula or diapers. I&rsquo;d guess diapers.

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?
Sophia&rsquo;s birthday. The Shawn Mullins concert. New computers. Watching Sophia on Christmas. Just to name a few.

16. What song will always remind you of 2009?
&ldquo;Light You Up&rdquo;, a still-unreleased Shawn Mullins song that he premiered a various concerts this summer -- including the one in the old porno theater in Portland.

17. Compared to this time last year, are you happier?
Yes. Much happier.

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?
Journal, take Sophia videos, document Sophia&rsquo;s first year. I&rsquo;d give us a B- in that category.

19. What do you wish you'd done less of?
Make the bed. I was struggling for something to write until Amanda asked me to make it.. J

20. How will you be spending Christmas?
Went to church at 8 instead of midnight. Had a traditional breakfast, opened presents as a family and then went up to Newberg to see Grandma, Grandpa, and Uncle Corey.

21. Who did you spend the most time on the phone with?
Probably my mom.

22. Did you find new love in 2009?
Oh yes. Every day. My newest love, of course, was and continues to be Sophia.

23. How many one-night stands?
Many, many, many. Amanda took more than her share of the midnight feedings. But looking back, I understand the talk about midnight feedings. All I can remember from March and April, really, is getting up to feed Sophia at 4 am and watching Seinfeld. Honorable mention goes to January (weird sleep habits thanks to painkillers) and October/early November (even weirder sleep habits thanks to being high on prednisone).

24. What was your favorite TV program?
Seinfeld. Would have gone nuts without the complete series, most of which I watched in Sophia&rsquo;s first couple of months. Couple of honorable mentions: Big Brother (of course), Desperate Housewives (thanks to swine flu), Friends (January/jello/late nights), American Idol, Fox News at 10, Intervention&hellip;

25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?
No.

26. What was the best book you read?
Kevin Nealon&rsquo;s fatherhood book. I had no idea, but he&rsquo;s a funny guy.

27. What was your greatest musical discovery?
Adam Lambert.

28. What did you want and get?
A healthy daughter. As I put it five years ago, an endless stock of razor blades and contact lenses. A camcorder. Computers. A chance to take the back way from Newberg up to 217, which I hadn&rsquo;t done in years.

29. What did you want and not get?
Have I mentioned how spoiled we were this year? I want a manager position. I want to be paid enough that Amanda can go part time or full time stay at home mom. We&rsquo;re still working at that.

30. What was your favorite film of this year?
UP. Great movie, and one that I can watch again and again. I had no idea when I sat down to watch that it would be so powerful.

31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?
I don&rsquo;t remember the answer to either question. ;)

32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?
Learning how to skip.

33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2009?
Gangbanger.

34. What kept you sane?
Amanda. Honorable mention to Seinfeld, and certainly to the baby swing. I relied on that swing more than Amanda, methinks.

35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?
For a brief while, Jon and Kate. Then I got very sick of them. I&rsquo;d rather fancy Shawn Mullins any day of the week.

36. What political issue stirred you the most?
A three way tie: health care, unemployment,&nbsp; and the potentially fudged numbers at Strategic Vision.

37. Who did you miss?
Old friends.

38. Who was the best new person you met?
Sophia J

39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2009:
I am good enough. Really, though, spending any time with Sophia reminds me that although I know I&rsquo;m nothing special, to her I am DAD. And so in her eyes, I am good enough. Profound, &iquest;no?

40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:
Now you are the burden/Of my generation/But I sure do love you/Let&rsquo;s get that straight.

-or-

It just keeps pouring out/Like juice from berries on the vine&hellip;."

"event","<P>Sophia is growing so fast. I am already becoming the stereotypical parent, saying that I want to write things down so I remember but yet time is going to fast to leave me time to think about milestones, etc.

Some milestones that come to mind.

*She has very recently learned how to blow raspberries. Little is as fun for her as laying on the couch (or floor) with me and blowing raspberries back and forth. Messy, disgusting sounding, and not at all lady-like, but very fun. Also very fun for me to get to see and hear her reactions when I play back. Of course, it's always fun to watch her reactions to things... but especially when she is amused.

*She has been giggling for quite some time now (started in late March or early April? see - that's why I should be keeping notes). But just today she had the biggest belly laugh that I've seen. You know, the kind where you almost choke you are laughing so hard. Oh, that was great.

*Since birth, she has been very strong. For instance, by three weeks she was demonstrating amazing head control when we held her. By six weeks, she was bearing some weight on her legs when we held her on our laps. Now she's pushing her torso up when on her stomach. We lay her down in the center of her crib on her belly to sleep, and she will wake up in the corner of the crib on her back. So I know she's been flipping over to a certain degree for a while, but today we were laying on the quilt playing with Barky (her first real toy, a little blue stuffed dog that barks) and she rolled herself from her back to her belly. Wow. And she's getting to the point that I hold her hands and she stomps her feet in an attempt to ""walk"" forward. She just wants to be mobile so badly - it is a little frustrating for her that she cannot move, but that's part of being a baby.

*Although she can't crawl, she has started the process of ""creeping"". It's still very primitive but exciting nonetheless.

*Speaking of things that have started, teething. She's grouchier now than when she was younger and I attribute it to gum pain. I feel bad for her, but what are you going to do? Of course, when she is distracted from the discomfort, she's a blast.

*Amanda has gotten me into the habit of watching Sesame Street with Sophia on my mornings off - may not have been intentional but that's the way it has gone down. I feel old saying it, but it's just not like I remember it ""back in my day"". Amanda described it best by saying something to the effect that it used to be 60% Mr. Rogers/feelings show, 40% learning show whereas now it is much more a learning show, and much less a feelings show. And although it is by no means <EM>bad</EM> (I do look forward to watching it with Sophia when she is old enough to understand it), it's very different, and I miss the old days.

*Just have to say that I am <EM>very</EM> excited to be watching Shawn Mullins at the Aladdin in Portland next Tuesday.

*Work is still work. I still feel every bit as passionate about my job but it takes a major backseat to the real priorities.

*Amanda did it very well and I will use her words to help me relive the <A href=""http://xomandykinsox.livejournal.com/153985.html"" target=_blank>birth</A>&nbsp;or the <A href=""http://xomandykinsox.livejournal.com/153593.html"" target=_blank>version</A>. No more words on those from me.

After all, my baby is awake, and although I have taken time to feed her between bullets on this post, it is time to spend some time with her.

Maybe tonight I will upload another video or two to my <A href=""http://www.youtube.com/my_videos"" target=_blank>YouTube</A>&nbsp;account.</P>"

And now to know without any doubt, by 11 pm eastern, that we have a new leader in President Elect Obama... how wonderful. And to know that&nbsp;we won't wake up tomorrow to see that the entire thing has changed a la 2000... this is all so great. Watching McCain's concession speech and Obama's victory speech... you could get a real feel for how important this day is. I'm very tired now and going to bed.

"event","My goodness, today was a fun day. The <EM>it</EM> that I referred to yesterday.. the feeling of impending busy-ness... it was back with a vengeance today. Granted, it didn't last all day, and it didn't even result in any big sales. But from 10-4 I was in constant demand. More often than not there were 2 or 3 people waiting to be helped. The department was crowded in a way that it hasn't been since... well, I can't recall a single time I've seen South Salem so crowded. Add to that the fact that we now have all but only one of our major six-hour items in store, and I'm getting pumped. Now begins my favorite two months of the year. The careful receiving of stock, the careful planning for Black Friday, the execution of the plans, the sales, the business... it never gets old for me. This is why I love my work. This is what I look forward to during the dreadfully slow summer months. It's exhausting. Oftentimes it becomes irritating. But I enjoy every moment of it. (And did I mention we are down to the final phase of receiving our six-hour merchandise... already? How awesome. Three full weeks of planning and executing without the need to worry about the ""did we gets"")

To continue with my recent obsession over gas mileage/prices --- someone was recently telling me how by driving at 63 mph they were able to get much better mileage than they used to at 70mph. So I decided to try it over the last week. It added about a <EM>minute</EM> to my commute (oh my, a whole minute!) <STRONG>but</STRONG> I got 35.7 miles to the gallon over the week. Compare that with my previous best of 33.99mpg, and my average of 32.4mpg in the Nissan, and I'm impressed. Granted, one 300 mile tank could easily represent a statistical outlier when compared with over&nbsp;5 months and 10,000 miles of data. But the point remains that for one extra minute I could potentially boost my gas mileage. It's worth further investigation to see if this was a fluke. Fluke or not, how about those gas prices? Less than four months ago, I paid $4.20/gal. 357 miles cost me $47.15 --- 13.2 cents per mile. Today, I paid <STRONG>$2.14</STRONG>/gal. 309 miles cost me <STRONG>$18.55</STRONG>. The last time I had a stop at the gas station cost less than $20? I can't recall, honestly. It hasn't happened since I started judiciously tracking mileage in May, that much is for certain. The really impressive stat today is the cost per mile... 5.9cents. There's plenty of talk that after the election on Tuesday, gas prices will stabilize or start increasing. I certainly hope not. But if they do, oh well. I am just thrilled with how low they have come.

25 weeks. 15 weeks left til February 15th. Depending on the perspective that could be a long time or not long at all. Putting it into some sort of perspective... fifteen weeks ago was July 19th. Nothing memorable to attribute to that date. But the biggest memory I have from&nbsp;July was the BBQ at my parents' house for my Aunt Sheila. I left work early that day... after setting Back to School in SOD, it was very sunny and hot on the drive home... Amanda skipped work the next day to stay up late and watch Big Brother with my parents (I had the next day off)... that feels like just yesterday, and it has been over 15 weeks already. I can only wonder... on February the 15th, will I look back on today, as a dad, and wonder where the time went? So many people have been buying baby clothes for us left and right. All of it is so adorable. And our daughter will be wearing these clothes next year. How crazy is that?!? There are times when I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the reality of the situation. And yet, by Thanksgiving, we'll have hit the beginning of the third trimester. I am beginning to doubt I'll have time to get my head fully wrapped around the situation before the situation is fully upon us. It's great! :)

Time for bed. Must take advantage of the extra hour of rest tonight."

"event","<P>On the way to work, I saw six pumpkins lined up in front of someone's house. They spelled O-B-A-M-A and the sixth one had the Obama logo. What a cool idea.

Work was quite busy today. And I felt.... <EM>it</EM>. The precursor to true busy-ness. The feeling in the air that people are starting to - or about to start - spending money. That's a great feeling. Exhilirating, really. I haven't had the chance to move with that sense of urgency since back to college at Corvallis, and even then it was not a real sense of urgency as it was not my store... I was just helping. This was a real sense of urgency. It was great. Sold two 52"" Samsung TVs, one right after the other. The second of which was sold to Darin Baker. Pretty fun. $4,000 in two transactions. Granted, in four short weeks, that sort of money in a short timeline will not be a big deal. But today, it is. 

That's about all that there is for today. I had a blast with it, but I don't have much more to say about it.</P>"

"event","<P>Just a couple of random thoughts from the day today.

*I'm ready for next Tuesday to be here and gone. Not that I haven't loved watching polling data change and comparing statistics from 2004 and 2008 (and one day looking all the way back to the 1868 election for some <EM>real</EM> historical perspective... and yes, I've loved FiveThirtyEight.com ... BUT we got at least half a dozen fliers in the mail today. Mostly vote Merkley, vote Smith, vote Merkley, vote Smith, vote Smith, vote Merkley Merkley Merkley Smith.... and a couple making fun of how ugly Bill Sizemore is and how his measures are terrible yadda yadda yadda (minus the sex)... Anyhow. I will say that it's <EM>really</EM> fascinating to watch the difference in state-by-state voting between the 1928 and 1932 elections. How cool is that!

*I most certainly <EM>will</EM> be working Thanksgiving day. I take that as very good news. The other half of that is that I will not be having to close a dozen times in the six weeks of the retail holiday season. Sure, I may have to close a couple of times. But not twice a week. So that's good. And honestly, I enjoy working Thanksgiving. I'm good at it, and it makes me more comfortable and confident with the level of preparation on Black Friday.

*Miami vs Denver on Sunday will be televised. And I'm off. How exciting. Very much so, thank you.

I think that's it for today. More some other time.</P>"

"event","Far too much drama today. It's quickly gotten late so no story time. I had on the tour today for every person to take one SD card and get 5-6 pictures around the store for use in our display digital picture frames. There were 5 frames needing pictures, 5 people working. Each person filled one frame. Very simple task. 
Daniel refused.

I mean... flat out refused to do as asked. I have <STRONG>never</STRONG> had an employee refuse to do as asked before. First time for everything, but for something so... stupid? Ridiculous. After far too much back-and-forth and second chances, the conversation got to the point of me confirming that I had asked him to do it, he refused, had <EM>told</EM> him to do it, and that he was still refusing. So I gave him an ultimatum - take the pictures, or I would send him home. He called my bluff and said something along the lines of ""I guess I'm going home then"". I let him know that as a result of his actions, I would be following up with Dave and disciplinary action would be taken. I think that's the point he realised I was dead serious. He reconsidered, and took the pictures. After getting back from taking his photos, he apologized for his actions.

I told him several times throughout the day... I know full well that taking 5-6 pictures is a <EM>small</EM> task. And I know that anyone could do it. I'm sure that I could have just had someone else take his pictures for him. But as I told him - that would be missing the whole point. The principle of the thing. That <STRONG>I</STRONG> am the manager here - and as such I will not tolerate an employee refusing to do as asked. 

It felt good to stand up for myself, but it was the most painfully awkward interaction that I can remember in quite some time. 



Every other thing about the day was great. As smooth and happily productive as could be.<lj-cut text=""free write time..""> I'll note that I even had a great conversation with Bendina over lunch. I made a comment about providence ... very casual, in my best attempt to not be preachy. Hearing my comment, Bendina's eyes lit up. She was taken off guard by me saying that. She was touched, though. Her reaction had an impact on me. Every day working around her has been a different experience. I have done my best to <EM>not</EM> walk on eggshells around her. It's very difficult... I want to avoid the topic of her boys, of anything relating to death. But she brings the topics up ................... I am honored, humbled, touched that Marcia specifically wants Bendina at SS through 1/4/09 and then at CV because, as she has told me several times now, there's no better combination to work with Bendina than Rich and me.&nbsp; I'm just trying to live up to those expectations. I don't feel qualified to help Bendina with her grief. But... if my faith can help, hmm. I wasn't able to directly help or be present during the funeral, yard sale.. all the times that Bendina was surrounded. This is the challenge I have been given. Maybe I'm not qualified to help with the grief, but this is my chance to ""be there""... </lj-cut>&nbsp;How cathartic. No story time but just as verbose as if I would have given story time...."

"event","<P>News on the work front. As of January 4th, I will be going back to Corvallis. Jose will be going to South Salem. Bendina is staying at SS until January 4th, and then coming to CV with me. Although I've been apprehensive about the idea of going back to Corvallis --- I know that it's an uphill battle and one in which I will not have a particularly supportive manager above me --- I am very happy about this news. Some reasons..

*I get to see Amanda at work, every day. I really have missed that.

*<STRONG>Gas</STRONG>. It's an 8 mile round trip commute working at Corvallis. Multiplied by five days a week and by two people (me and Amanda), that's 80 miles per week driven for commute. Compare that to the 80 mile one way commute to and from Salem. A week's worth of total household driving equates to <STRONG>one day</STRONG> of driving at my current location. If gas stays at this price, It'll cost around $7 a week to drive to work. Right now, I'm around $35 per week. That's a $28 weekly savings, make that $100 a month that I'll save on gas. More savings if gas increases. Of course, I would be fine if it keeps going down... less savings but less overall cost!

*Time. Right now if I work 7-5, I'm home around 6pm. After 1/4, I'll be getting home around 5:15pm. I get my evenings back with a vengeance! Not to mention that my days usually last 12 hours from leaving home to getting home. Come January... 10 1/2 hours, tops. Talk about adding an extra hour and a half to my day! On the other end of the day, come January I can wake up at 6 am for a 7 am shift and have time to <EM>very leisurely</EM> get ready for work. Nowadays, by 6 am I need to be finishing up and out the door by 6:10 am. Extra sleep!

*Chance to continue to prove myself to Marcia. She's made it clear that she expects good things. She wants the department <EM>clean</EM> and she no longer wants to walk in and see watter bottles and miscellaneous crap behind the counter. 

*Bringing Bendina over the same day I come. First... I don't think it would be wise to send Bendina back to the same environment as she came from. Being in a new environment she can have something of a fresh start. She can create an identity for herself that does not involve the boys centrally like her identity did at Albany. That isn't to say that they shouldn't play a part in who she is - they always will as that grief will stay with her for the rest of her life, certainly - but knowing her and seeing her progress since working with me, I think it is fair to say that in work terms, some new scenery will do her good. 
---&gt; Not to mention that (a) keeping her at SS through Christmas will give me 6 extra weeks to prepare her for Corvallis, to teach her, to get her primed, to essentially turn her into my assistant&nbsp;- which is how I fully intend to use her and (b) bringing her over will make my transition easier. The toughest part of a new location is getting the department on the same page. On <EM>my</EM> page. Well, I'll have one key employee already on my page.
----&gt; On top of that, the timing will work out well. We will have a month and a half or so to work together on the top level most visible problems, and to get started on the maintenance problems. Then she will have time to maintain the department while I'm on leave (great development time for her), and then I'll get back and we'll have the department polished and shining by the end of the school year. By that point, it'll be time to start planning for a new BTS/BTC season, and with two steady hands I think we can do quite well. But that's getting a bit ahead of myself.

For now, let it be simplified that I'm excited with the direction that we're going. There are plenty of more reasons that I'm excited about this, that for the sake of brevity (haha, when have I been known to be brief) I've omitted.</P>"

"event","Driving home today, having just gotten on to Philomath Blvd, 2 police cars came screaming down the street behind me. Both of them were sirens blazing, all lights on, moving fast to wherever they were going. I think they were actually state troopers, but it was dark and they were going fast.. I didn't catch it. The funny part is that Meredith Brooks' song ""My Little Town"" had just started on my iPod as the police approached.

[backstory] ... Remember Meredith Brooks? She sang ""Bitch"" back in the mid-90s. Good song, cool video in which she floats around in a spinning room. Anyway. On the same album, she sings about how she spent her youth in her little town, wanting to get away to the big city. Now she just wants to get back to the peace and quiet. Her little town was Corvallis. How about that. And it's true... Corvallis is a peaceful town. The worst thing that happens here is college kids getting drunk on the weekends. But (especially when the kids are gone for the summer!) it's a quiet, peaceful town. Nice place to live. Safe. [/backstory] ... So as her tribute to the peaceful town (Corvallis) begins, two cops come roaring down the street. I cracked up.

In other news... I got to deal with some drama at work today. I think one of my employees is having something of a breakdown. He didn't show up for his shift today. I couldn't get a hold of him. He called about an hour past his shift's start time, and when I asked if he was okay, he told me ""I guess"". When I asked if he knew he was scheduled, he did. He ""didn't know"" if he was going to come in. Just an eery, cold, quiet tone. He decided to come in, but by that point I was pretty well freaked out. For someone who is normally jovial, talkative, outgoing, friendly... to act like this... it reminds me somewhat of Terrence's breakdown at Corvallis two years ago. I don't much care for the position I was put in - talking him in to coming in to work... asking him what he wanted me to do... very awkward position. Very awkward phone call. Not one I would care to repeat any time soon.

Other than that though... pretty good day at work. Oh... and in the life of gas purchasing...paid $2.719/gallon today. Get this.. that is down 50 cents in 17 days... 29 cents in ten days... 21 cents in five days.. One month ago I was thrilled to pay $3.38. Considering that just over 3 months ago I paid $4.20... $2.72 does not look bad at all. Granted, this does include a 10 cent rewards discount and an additional 10 cent employee discount... so a regular customer would have paid $2.92. Still.. no complaints from me!

[edit] At $24.72, that was the cheapest fillup I have had for the Nissan since purchasing it in May. The scary part... I have had 6 fillups with fewer miles than today. My July 14th fillup gave me 294 miles (versus 295 today).. and cost $39.01... $14 more for one mile less. How crazy. Love these sinking gas prices!&nbsp;And love documenting what I've spent so I can look back on it and track it.....&nbsp;[/edit]"

"event","Let the record show... I do not much care for MNF games between the Broncos and the Patriots. It's true that over the past 10+ years, the Broncos have owned the Patriots in regular games. Something like 8-3 under Mike Shanahan against the Patriots. One of those three losses came <A href=""http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter?game_id=26405&season=2003&displayPage=tab_gamecenter&week=REG9"" target=_blank>five years ago</A>&nbsp;in a Monday night heartbreaker. And then there's tonight's <A href=""http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/29630/NE_Gamebook.pdf"" target=_blank>41-7 loss</A>. Just plain despicable. 4-3 isn't a bad record for this point in the season, and it's still good enough for a one game division lead. At least their schedule for the rest of the season is looking slightly easier than that of the San Diego Chargers - the only other team that has any real shot at the division. 

Anyway... I have 13 days to mull over this loss and hope that the Broncos can come back and win against Miami to make it 5-3 instead of 4-4...

In other fun... during the commercials I got to enjoy Comcast Sports Net showing the May 31, 1990 game between the Portland Trail Blazers and Phoenix Suns... game 6 of the Western Conference Championships. Portland won the game 112-109. While I was dejected watching the Broncos fall apart, I actually found myself cheering for the Blazers. I actually clapped on a couple of great Clyde ""The Glide"" Drexler steals and one <STRONG>great</STRONG> Drexler dunk. I have vague recollections of those years of basketball... all of the names were familiar to me. But really, I was too young to admire how great those Blazers were. It's a wonder that they didn't win any championships. But then again, they were playing against Magic Johnson/Joe Dumars and of course later Michael Jordan in the finals during the early 90s. Do I remember watching a couple of those games at Aunt Sheila &amp; Uncle Bob's place? Maybe it was the finals against the Pistons. But I could swear there was at least one game that I watched there between the Blazers and Suns.
Anyway. Isn't it amazing how after 18 years watching those teams can still be that much fun, and I could get so into it? I think so.
At least I got to watch <EM>one</EM> team win.
Even if it was 18 years ago!"

"event","<P>Well it's been too long. And any time I go months without updating, I have a hard time thinking of where to start up again. Several times over the last couple of months I have wanted to update... just to mention little things along the way that have now left my mind. But the idea of updating is so daunting when faced with months of events left unmentioned.
<lj-cut text=""Roughly 4 months worth of updates in one post..."">
July was a quiet month around here. Mostly just a month spent working and trying to avoid the heat. Then again, it wasn't terribly hot this year. There were a couple of days above 100 degrees but really, the worst heat wave of the year was around the time of our honeymoon. By the time July hit, the worst hot weather of the year had passed. 

August was more memorable. I spent a lot of time at work. Dave took most of the month off, which left me in charge. That was great. The way the schedule worked out, though... I worked two 6 day weeks. Great paychecks but long weeks. Many hours spent on the NFL TV display. Out of 50 hours worked that particular week... probably about 20-25 hours on that display. Exhausting. Saw two concerts in August. Prior to that, had only seen one (big) concert. ---- I don't count any of the fairs that I have seen concerts at... they just don't count ---....... Pat Benatar was on the hottest day of summer proper. Easily 105 degrees at 7 pm when the concert started. Her opener wasn't exciting but she and her husband are quite good. I hadn't realized before that day but that woman can belt it and she has some really great songs that I was completely unaware of prior to the concert. Wasn't even one I would have ordinarily gone to but it was a going away gift from the folks at Albany (based on the inside joke that apparently Pat Benatar is my mother). Great gift. ALSO went to the Oregon Zoo for the Avett (pronounced Ay-vet) Brothers concert. They are very energetic on stage!

... or so we are told. The opening act for the Avett Brothers was Shawn Mullins... and of course he is the reason we went up to the Zoo. Fun fact: it was <EM>pouring</EM> rain through the whole concert. We spent the whole show (except for his first song, ""Twin Rocks, Oregon"") practically within arms reach of the stage getting drenched, rocking out. He was ""just"" an opener, but let's be honest, he was much better than the Avett Brothers. We stuck around for the first 30 seconds or so of there set. Then the lead singer opened his mouth, and we left. They were terrible. But he was worth every penny spent that day. Absolutely wonderful. And his set lasted a full hour. I'm afraid not many people even know who he is. And that's a shame, because he tells the best stories with his music.

Anyway... enough about that, I think, for now.

September was busy, but not quite as busy as August. Had I spent time writing about little things throughout the month I would have chronicled my adventures in Albany. Turns out that department has fallen apart since I left. One bad thing has happened after another (the most tragic being the LOA that Bendina went on after the loss of her ex-husband and two young sons)... but ultimately, the department has been so badly mismanaged that the stockroom and salesfloor alike are in a shambles. Basic maintenance has not been performed in a matter of months, and it shows. And when I spent two days there in September prepping for and then managing their MMK inventory, I realized first hand how bad things had become. Being told by Rhonda and Nicole alike that my presence brought them more joy at work than they'd had in months was equally touching, humbling, and scary. Yes, we had great times together, but my departure should not mark the total loss of joy at work, and it appears as though it has. <STRONG>SCARY</STRONG>. One more point to rant about in that area... I also worked CV's back to college. (By the way, that was the most fun BTC night for me to date. Bigger sales than ever, more fun had with buying staff than ever, dancers in the deli, just an overall blast).... That day, I worked 10-8:30 (prepping inventory at Albany and transferring merchandise to CV). Then I turned around and worked 9:30-1:30 (BTC at CV). Then it was back to AB for 9-7 the next day (to work their inventory). Though it was tiring, it was rewarding to handle both situations. At the same time, my primary responsibility to South Salem was under control. I put my time in preceding and following the two day stint making sure everything was okay up there. Compare that to Cassy, who clearly put all her focus into CV while letting AB slide... Seriously, I handled my responsibilities at SS, managed AB, and had fun at CV all at once. She couldn't even handle her responsibilities at AB because she was too busy having fun at CV. It left a bad taste in my mouth that remains more bitter than I realize even now. 

September was big for more than just work reasons. At the end of the month, Amanda had her 20 week ultrasound. There are pictures but I now see that they are all on my email rather than my hard drive. Considering the late hour, I won't be posting them tonight. Later. The ultrasound was one of the best experiences of the pregnancy to date. Seeing our baby move around on the screen brought a tear to my eye. We found out (after Amanda's incorrect guess and my panic that I didn't see anything even though Amanda did)... that we are having a baby girl. Secretly, quietly, I (both of us) had been hoping for a baby girl. At the ultrasound, the technician showed her measurements to us and revealed that by all measurements that he took, she would be due between February 8 and February 18. Her original EDD was February 15, so we're right on track. Today, at the 22 week checkup the rest of the results were given to us. All body parts and organs were listed off as ""unremarkable and normal"". Never before ...and probably never again... have I been so relieved to hear my daughter referred to as ""unremarkable"". All of her structural measurements are where they should be for a mid-February due date, all of the labs to date have been normal. Actually, from my perspective this has been quite an easy pregnancy. Amanda has had very little symptoms to complain of to date. Overall, just a very normal, even ... <EM>easy</EM>... pregnancy. And, yes, she is showing now. Especially to me, but even to coworkers now. The best thing so far from my perspective has been the blessing of feeling my daughter kick. (How surreal it still is to use the phrase ""my daughter"")... I cannot put it to words. It gives life new meaning. In retrospect, everything before this seems trivial. She is not even born yet, and still our daughter has changed everything about the way that Amanda and I view the world and life in general. 

I think that is quite enough for tonight. Having gotten some of the ""bigger"" stuff out of the way... maybe tomorrow and over the following days I can post some of the mundane... daily, trivial happenings. I'd like to get back to that habit, even if it only lasts a few weeks like last time around...</P>"

"event","What a crazy day. Really, what a crazy last two or four hours or so. To cut to the chase...

First, I had a customer who badly wanted to buy the display of my Philips 50"" Plasma TV - last year's model. He expected to pay $900 when quite honestly I could sell it as low as $800 if I had to. Knowing full well how hard it is to sell a display like that, I tried hard to find a store with a spare last-one-only-display around. I couldn't. So I sold the customer the display, resolving to instead find a store to pawn the last boxed model off on. Turns out, MF was happy to take a TV off our hands, figuring they could sell it over the weekend. Great, a win win win!

Then, I had one of my least pleasant photo customers I've had since coming to SS. Nothing terribly special about him but just a lot of talking down to me in a very rude way... By the time I was done dealing with him, I needed a break. In AB terms, it was time for ""a walk"". I would have told Cassy that I needed ""a walk"".. she would have laughed with me, and I'd be away until I could regain my cool.

Quite immediately after my break, I noticed a pair of customers eyeballing the same 50"" TV which I had just sold. I had pulled the fact tag for the other customer but this second pair was very interested in purchasing the TV. So I called MF, told them that I'd be selling the TV before I could send it down to them... and then sold it. So I wound up selling both 50"" Philips plasma TVs tonight with barely even trying.... and in the completely reverse order of what I would have <EM>ever</EM> expected.

What a fun night it was."

"event","<P>This has been a great Memorial Day weekend. I spent yesterday morning quietly taking care of minimal chores - laundry and the kitchen, namely. Amanda and I had our traditional Sunday lunch at El Sol... but that left both of us with bad reactions to the greasiness - may have to make alterations to our Sunday lunch routine in the future... In the afternoon, Matt Woodstock came over and joined us for some MarioKart action. That was a total blast. It actually turned into an all afternoon/evening thing lasting until almost 1 am. I did more watching than playing but had plenty of fun with that. It wasn't until this morning that Amanda and I realized that we could have used our Gamecube controller to make three person games. But c'est la vie...

Today has been very relaxing. I intended to vacuum but that never truly materialized. Instead, I spent the day sleeping in with Amanda and then lounging with Amanda. One point to note, though... I made dinner for the two of us tonight. Nothing special, just pork chops and corn, but considering how infrequently I cook (very close to never) it deserves notice. And on top of everything else, the food wasn't at all bad! Okay, so it turns out I am capable of cooking very basic meals after all! :) ...

In any event, today was my Sunday, leading into a four day week that starts tomorrow. I open the next two days which will mark the first time that I've really opened at SS. True, I did have one 7-5 shift before the wedding but none of that week really counts for anything, and I really don't remember any of the opening routine for SS. It's roughly the same everywhere, but each time I go to a new store I'm surprised at how unique each location's individual routines are. And I look forward to learning the opening routine at SS. </P>"

"event","In no particular order:

*I work just a couple of blocks away from <A href=""http://blog.oregonlive.com/idiotbox/2008/02/salem_bikini_barista_to_be_in.html"" target=_blank>the Bikini Coffee Co.</A>&nbsp;of Salem, OR. Actually, I pass it every day coming from and going to work. Hahaha! I should stop by and slap Natalie sometime, on behalf of all of the ""Beaver State"". 

*If the one hour machine is giving you fits, call RIMG. We have a contract with them for a reason... We are a major reason why their call center is open almost all day, and we need to use it! If, <STRONG>after</STRONG> calling RIMG, it is determined that the machine will be down for any duration, <STRONG>do not</STRONG> tell customers ""the machine is broken"" or ""who knows how long it'll be""... what a great way to tell someone that you don't care about their precious photos. If I was a customer and someone told me that, I would run for the hills! ... and these are a couple of the lessons I get to teach to Mike, my new James. If I look at him in that respect, he might still have a chance. As James showed tremendous improvement, so too can Mike. First step is to remove his bad influencers... and the #1 influencer is Shonna's likely assistant-to-be. We'll see. It's just no good to have to be right back at square one in so many regards. 

*But! I get a new employee next week. And <STRONG>I</STRONG> get to be his buddy shift! That translates to a blank slate for me to teach and mold into the kind of employee I like having around.

*I had a customer to really sell to today. Not the standard just being cheerful and helpful and friendly but that plus <EM>selling</EM> to the customer. I know what I mean but I doubt anyone else will fully understand the differentiation there. Anyway, with 15 minutes left in my shift and everything accomplished that I had reasonably hoped to get done, I started floating between customers. I got lucky with one man who was looking at a HTIB. He was with his wife and daughter. Under most circumstances in the past I'd have sold to the wife (or in some cases daughter if old enough) but I decided to try a reversal this time, <EM>selling</EM> to the man while only just helping the woman. The sale wasn't quite as <EM>smooth</EM> as my normal interaction but even so I managed to earn a sale with a customer who was only ""just looking"" and ""hadn't even started comparison shopping yet"". 
At AB, I had that kind of interaction all the time, oftentimes several times a day. But it's been at least two weeks since I've had such a sale, and I missed it!

*When Cassy said that Dave takes lots of vacation, she wasn't kidding. He's taking about two weeks worth between now and early August and then <STRONG>25 </STRONG>(!) days spanning the majority of August. So in essence, I get my own store that month, lol :) And lots of 7-5s to come. Looks like the pattern of 7-5 and 9-7 when he's around will continue for the near future. No complaints from me!

*I made myself dinner tonight (more than the typical soup or salad or cereal that I'd prepare myself on this kind of night). Pork chops and corn with brown rice. The corn, which I was most looking forward to of it all, was <EM>awful</EM>. Just plain not good corn. Or maybe it was good and the problem was that I prefer yellow corn to white. Who knows? But the pork chops, which I have never made before, were <EM>delicious!</EM> I am quite proud of myself for that. Well seasoned and everything, well cooked but not overcooked. 

I'm reasonably sure that I have covered everything I wanted, so I think I'm going to go to bed. Fourteen days off, two on, and now time for another two off!"

"event","<P>This weekend was very.. busy. Early in the week we learned that OSU Federal as hosting a car sale-thing at the Fairgrounds, which we decided to visit on Friday. By the time we arrived, all of the dealers were packing up and leaving. The beauty was that the OSU Federal tent was still up, and we were able to get pre-approved for $10,000 - not bad considering just six months ago they wouldn't approve a penny over $5,000. It pays to make all payments on time, especially those to OSU Federal? I guess so! So with our pre-approval slip in hand (written to only $9,000) we went walking through the maze of cars. Since dealers were packing up for the night, we were able to look without being interrupted by pesky salespeople. There were a few nice-ish looking cars around our budget range but nothing to be excited about. Except for in the Wilson Motors section of the lot. Three cars caught our eyes there. So we went home and did some research, did some figuring about cost/benefit analysis, and went to bed.

Saturday morning we got up early and got back to the car sale by 9:30. It didn't take long for us to get helped. Long story short... we wound up buying a 2003 Nissan Sentra GXE for $8,400. I'm pretty happy with the price, it's some $1,500 under KBB and actually it's only $500 over the KBB for a private party sale. I'm excited to be getting 30+mpg as compared to barely 20 mpg with the van. That change should save&nbsp;us at least $100 a month in gas costs. More important... I don't have to wake up at midnight on Sundays anymore! Or at 3 or 4 or 5 every other day of the week. Now when I get up, it's so I can get up. That is tremendously exciting. Plus, the car is just fun to drive. Although I dread going back to work on Wednesday, I look forward to the <EM>drive</EM>! :)

Yesterday was almost as fun as Saturday. We had our weekly lunch with Johnny (Amanda's fake name for our waiter at the El Sol restaurant) and we went shopping at CV... printed off some pictures from our cameras. Of course, once we get photos from Ava and everyone else we will probably be replacing some of the shots but it was fun.

And on the way home we decided it was time to look at cell phones. We've been dealing with T-Mobile's poor coverage for 3 years (and Amanda had been dealing with it long before we met) and I haven't had my own cell phone in years. So on a whim we stopped in the Verizon store right next to our apartments. Of all the people to be there that day, it was Kevin. Krosten Vharles' Kevin! Yes, the Kevin that Stu and I met <A href=""http://ashlandsou.livejournal.com/137528.html"" target=_blank>during our Roseburg trip</A>&nbsp;in 2004, and who <A href=""http://ashlandsou.livejournal.com/137528.html"" target=_blank>played poker with us</A>&nbsp;at the 9/11 shindig. Talk about fun! Well, we were approved for a contract without deposit and that got the ball rolling. After several minutes discussing plans and phones and other such things, we wound up buying, and we both have brand new cell phones with great signals.

So, busy weekend. New car plus new cell phones&nbsp;- I'm spent! Today is the day for Albany - social security office and DMV to get the state and feds to recognize us as married. Then its on to FM to change Amanda Gilbert to Amanda Helling, and from there the sky is the limit. Banks, credit cards, all sorts of name change fun!</P>"

So the first part of the vacation leading up to the wedding was a blast. Kent and Rayetta arrived shortly after 2 pm on Sunday, and we went to work moving stuff up to the apartment. They donated, among other things, a shredder, a shelf, and a console TV to us. One man's trash is another's treasure. That TV... yikes, it must weigh a hundred pounds, and getting it up the stairs to the apartment was not an easy task. I was sore from it until mid-week.

We were on the road by 3 pm and at Sutherlin by 5. After our usual stop there (why no pictures this time?) we got right back on the road and got to the hotel around 7 o clock. There was a family of four checking in right as we arrived. They had some confusion about name spelling which resulted in the father getting the kids packed back into the car just in time for the desk clerk to figure everything out, at which time he got to re-un-pack the kids. Fortunately, they were all good-spirited about the mixup. More fortunately, there was no such mixup for us. Our room was 311, a very short walk from the elevator. Two notes about the hotel: they were under construction - which turned out to be a non-issue, and they had homemade cookies available Sunday night which were delicious.

Anyhow, we spent the evening unpacking and generally trying to relax. We got up Monday morning just before 2 am. We needed to go to the airport to pick up Amanda's extended family, whose ETA was just before 2. After a little difficulty finding parking (as with the hotel, the airport was under construction) we arrived. The airport was <EM>dead</EM>, as you may expect considering the hour. Anyhow, Amanda's family arrived shortly after 2. We chatted while waiting for luggage but the conversation was minimal, all of us were tired - and they all had a three hour jet lag to recover from.

Monday started early-ish. I woke at 8 am almost well rested. I joined Amanda's family in the lobby for a surprisingly good continental breakfast. It was about that point that I started to get to know people and in the interest of brevity I'll just say that I really got to like them over the course of the week. Great humor all around and good fun to be around. How fortunate. 

The plan for Monday was to go to the Redwoods with Amanda's family and try to relax for the day. The day started off well enough. We hit the road earlier than we expected - something like 10 am compared to noon. By noon,&nbsp;we were getting&nbsp;weary so we&nbsp;decided to stop at&nbsp;<A href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ashlandsou/pic/0000wdcd/g11"" target=_blank>a rest stop in California</A>&nbsp;just south of the border. Beautiful rest stop for a beautiful day. I took the picture of the bird below. I'm pretty proud of it since my shots are usually pretty terrible. I just wish that branch wasn't in the way.

<IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ashlandsou/pic/00011xk1/s640x480"" width=640>


Anyhow. Long story short, we started getting tired of the driving. Road signs indicated that Eureka (where the Redwoods proper are supposed to be) was another 100 or so miles away, and none of us really wanted to go that much further only to turn back around. So we decided that the right thing to do would be to change this from a Redwoods trip to a coast trip with some stops for tree views along the way. After all, the trees that we were passing were <EM>huge</EM> so even if we weren't getting the full Redwoods we'd still have fun anyway.

So we went to Crescent City, CA and parked at the first sign of beach. It was the perfect day for a beach trip, if a little cool by the water. We even had the pleasure to feed a family of chipmunks... very friendly chipmunks. This little guy here loved chips. I still can't believe how close they got to us.

On the way back to Medford, we did stop several times to look at trees. Amanda's cousin Josh climbed one of the stumps. Amanda climbed one, although I overlooked uploading it. Maybe later? <STRONG>EDIT: I did it! Yay my team! :)</STRONG>

<IMG title="""" height=423 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ashlandsou/pic/0007bc94/s640x480"">


During our longest tree-looking-outing (in a state park where the attendant didn't make us pay to park) we went to a river. Below you can see the river, Josh and his dad Todd skipping rocks, and his brother Robby.

<IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ashlandsou/pic/0004dtw0/s640x480"">

We made one more stop before Oregon at a podunk convenience shop, where Amanda and I each bought the worst egg salad sandwiches ever. I mean.. <EM>the worst</EM>. They were bad.

Upon arriving in Medford, we joined Kent and Rayetta at Applebees.&nbsp;Robby surprised their grandma by telling the waitress that it was her birthday (over the weekend...) and the waitresses did the whole song/ice cream thing. Surprised us all, really.

After the dinner, we were all quite exhausted. We met back up in the hotel lobby where we spent a half hour or so shooting the breeze and playing ""throw the ball into the bowl"".

<IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ashlandsou/pic/0005f1z9/s640x480"">


Tuesday was not nearly as eventful as Monday. Met with my parents in the morning for brunch, checked out of the hotel (why we unpacked so thoroughly on Sunday remains a mystery), shopped at Pier One and Michael's, had lunch at Olive Garden, Amanda discovered that <STRONG>one of her diamonds in her engagement ring fell out</STRONG>... her cousin Josh was great about the way he told everyone so discretely... went to FM jewelers where they thankfully were able to fix the situation in under six hours, bought me clothes at Kohl's, picked up two ice cream cones (in 90+ degrees is it any reason that they melted all over me that quick? It was <EM>painful!)</EM>... had our rehearsal at the wedding site. From there Andrew, Corey and I went to FM where we met Chris for the bachelor party.

That was a blast! We went to the Seven Feathers casino in Canyonville (about 70 miles from Medford). People donated $100 to me for gambling, which was great! We got to the casino safely enough, but Andrew was so excited to get to the parking spot that he drove onto and over the sidewalk to get there. Yep, we used the sidewalk! Hahaha. Gambling was fun but I lost every penny. Perhaps more fun was the drinking part. All three of them bought me drinks. I had a Jager bomb, a glass of Jack, and a long island iced tea. I think that was all? I felt pretty good but didn't realize how drunk I was until I stood up... lol :)

<IMG title="""" height=423 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ashlandsou/pic/0007c0r1/s640x480"">

So that was the vacation leading up to the day of the wedding. Depending on the photo upload I may post the wedding day still tonight or maybe tomorrow. We'll see :0"

*No more Ashley. Replaced with a Plymouth Voyager - of all cars out there - that we bought from the Hickingbottoms in March
*Traded with Jose for AB/005 in April. 
*Wedding plans continue at an astonishing pace. Amanda now has her wedding dress. We have selected a location, just need to pay for that. Things continue to go swimmingly. Daily drama comes and goes but the love only grows through and often because of it.
*Jennifer, manager at AB, is leaving the company for Colorado next Friday. I've applied for her position. Frankly I don't think I'll get it. I've heard talk that Cassy (manager at Florence and the assistant that immediately preceded me at CV) wants the job. On top of that, promoting from the same store is very rare. Ultimately, I am tired of the drama and politics. I'm trying to balance <STRONG>very</STRONG> strongly wanting the promotion with my understanding of the situation. There are many at the location that would love to see me get it. I try to hide my enthusiasm, especially around them. The last thing that needs to happen is for someone else to get the job and then come into a department that is marginalized and polarized against them. That's just plain counter-productive. And yet I find myself becoming the more highly liked and respected manager. Respected - great. But I would honestly rather not be liked that way. I don't need to be hated but I would rather keep personal emotions and feelings out of it. It makes things smoother. Either way, I just want the politics over.

This is a good start. It's about time that I hopped back in."

I even made space on the DVD wall for tomorrow's new releases. It's going to be an insane hour from 6-7, but I'm going to love it.

Work is progressing well. James has been given the morning freight position, and is already thriving in it. That's left us with an opening for closing PIC. So far, the only person interested in the position has been Jeff Hill from AB. I've wanted to steal him from AB since back to college night. 

What else? I've had thoughts floating in my head but they're not making themsleves into words. Things at the homefront are progressing nicely as well. It looks like we're going to buy Jenn's van. '94 Plymouth Voyager with 130,000 or so miles for $1,500. Kelley Blue Book is right around the same number, and I'm pretty comfortable with it. We're looking for hotel rooms for Friday the 23rd. By then my taxes should have come in, and with any luck my Sirva as well. In all I'm looking at just under $900 coming to me, which will bring us up to about $2,900. Subtract the car money, and it'll be about $1,400 in savings left. Awesome. 

And it sounds like my dad will be picking up the car on or around the 27th. So the timing will be just right, if things continue on the same track as they're headed now."

"event","We were given a loan today for $5,000. We're putting about $800 of it toward a new car (bringing us to just over $1,800 for a car), $2,200 toward various bills and payments and whatnot, and $2,000 toward my federal school loan. It's going to cost us: $167 per month on the 20th of each month. That's about the most that we can safely afford for a loan but we're now looking at just the $150 school loan and the $167 OSU Federal loan plus standard utility bills. No more debt collectors, no more past due medical bills. The real beauty is that in three years this $5,000 loan will be paid off and we will have a joint record of 36 consecutive monthly payments paid on time. That will make a pretty good start to our credit history together. By that point, I'll be moving toward 40 straight school loan payments made on time, which should bring me down to somewhere between $5,000 and $9,000 left to pay in school loans --- 4 or 5 more years after that school loans should be paid off. We now have a reasonable way of being out of debt by the time we're 30. Of course, by that point we'll be paying off plenty of other things, but this is the building block - earning credit to get people to lend us money for those other things that we'll be paying off when we're 30. 

Next step: if the Carfax report comes through looking nice on Jenn's van, and it looks as good in person as it does on paper, we'll put out $1,500 for it. And most important to me of all is that my parents will have nothing on me. Hopefully, all of those things will happen in March. I had no idea that February would bring us so much closer to absolute financial freedom. Of course, it took a couple of curveballs to get there - what else is new in a February - but it's making March look pretty good.

In the short term, it is going to be an uphill week. We won't have much money left over after rent but we won't have much more to pay out in bills through the remainder of March - probably around $200 which we could actually manage this week. 

Things are looking up."

"event","Worked a closing shift last night. I tell you what - I'm pretty near worthless by about 9:30. After 9:30, I'm truly worthless. Speaking of worthless, guess who spent much of their shift last night texting on their cell phone? Spencer. Yeah, Chris mentioned that he'd watched it on camera for a good long time. I requested that he report it to me if he sees it again. I'm not surprised - the quality of work was well below standard and things just weren't getting done. Had I known that that was what he was doing, I would have warned him once then sent him home straight away. I just don't tolerate that sort of bullshit anymore. 

Which reminds me. Tim dropped by yesterday. He continues to impress me more and more. For as little as he works, you'd think that he wouldn't care - or would seem not to care. But that just isn't the case there. Anyway, he was talking to me about a conversation that he'd had with James Golan. They were discussing James's Relief Assistant Manager papers. Somewhere in there (probably several times) the papers refer to skills at delegating tasks. James asked Tim what delegating is. (I'm not sure if he was making a joke or serious - I wasn't there haha). Of course, Tim and I got a good laugh out of the comment. He mentioned that he'd told Tim ""basically, it's what you do"". Then, Tim commented that in his opinion, I am the ""king of delegating"" in our department. I was very touched. I've been trying to earn that reputation for a long time. In the last couple of months, I feel like I've become the king of delegating.&nbsp; I have a mental picture of what I want to see happen in the department, and I communicate that well to everyone who needs to hear it. Everyone hears exactly what they need to do to make the vision come true and everything works well. And you know what, the stockroom is beautiful, the department is almost to standard in most ways, and we continue to make double discount sales increses over last year. My methods are working well, wouldn't you say?"

"event","I want to touch on two very opposite things before I go to bed.

First thing is the car. When I called my mom on... Wednesday? .... to tell her about how my week was going, that was when she and dad decided to finally take the car away from us. See, I have a long history of late and non-payment on that car that even predates this journal. And through the whole experience, they have a mutual history of false threats and long periods of letting me not pay. Their point is that if they were a bank, they would have taken the car away from me long ago. Of course, they are not a bank, and if they were really trying to teach me a lesson about responsibility as they allege, I would think that they would have taught me ficscal resonsibility by their actions long ago. But that's not something for them to do, really. 

I accept that losing the car has been inevitable for a long time coming. I accept that I have been poor at repaying my financial obligations to my parents. But the timing was terrible.

I'm past the bad news of losing my car for now. After all, that means that Amanda and I can now get <EM>our</EM> car. We can show fiscal responsibiltiy to creditors, and have something that is ours to take pride in. And most important of all, my mom will no longer have something to hold over my head. This car has come between us in such staggering ways. Now, if I talk to her it's because I want to talk to her, not because I have an obligation. Finally, finally, I will be free of her. Free at last. And I truly cannot wait for the first phone call after the car is taken. When she says ""it's so hard to reach you"" or ""you never paid for that car"" or whatever other nonsense she works into her head. I'll tell it to her as it is, as I've had bottled up for years. Finally. I can't say how much I look forward to that.

Is that a step backwards? No. It's a step toward independence. Ten years from now, the car will have had a good life but will be in need of replacement. My parents taking the car from me will be insignificant on my life's radar. What will be more significant ten years from now - that I messed up the whole car thing, or that my mom was too busy popping pills while I was growing up&nbsp;(not to mention through the majority of the last year and a half) to be there. Hmmmph.

After the phone call to my parents, Amanda shot an email off to her dad, basically asking for help. At first, she was talking as if she would love monetary support. But we got some sense and decided to apply for a loan on Friday. Denied, of course. Only chance for approval? Get a cosigner. Easy solution. So now we're asking her dad to cosign for us. Rather than support us by sending money, we'd both rather that he support us by <EM>helping</EM> us be independent. Is it clear what the difference is? My parents want to <EM>make</EM> us be independent, her dad wants to <EM>help</EM>us be independent. They both want the same thing but the approach is worlds apart. 

While talking to Amanda's dad, I took the phone to the bedroom, and asked his permission to ask Amanda to marry me. Wrong order, I know, but I know that Amanda and her dad have a very close relationship. His words: ""I would be honored to have you as my son in law"". The man was a marine. To use the word honor is meaningful. And he used it repetitively. He said that my asking was unnecessary but that he was genuinely touched and it made him respect our relationship even more than he already did. His voice had a joyful tone in it that is so genuine - it made the troubles of earlier in the week seem insignificant by comparison. 

And I think I'm going to choose that as a good stopping point for the evening. I have more to say on both of these topics but later. Later."

"event","Why did I not get an HSA for 2006? Or 2005? I guess that I was just afraid that I was being ""sold"" into an HSA plan that would leave me unable to pay for my medical bills. Instead, I logged into my HSA site today and activated my debit card. One month into the year and I already have $200+ waiting for me to spend on any medical bills that I want. I've put probably $45 of that... Fred Meyer has paid the rest. What a brilliant idea. It's good for them because they can cover less on emergency services this way and require higher deductibles and it's better for me because this is just plain money that I can use on any medical related stuff I want. So today I stopped by the optometrist's office and bought contacts... $90. I thought those suckers would cost $200 for a six month supply. Less than half of what I expected... and although technically ""out of pocket"" they cost me virtually nothing. --- Of course, they have to order my contacts because they don't keep them in stock but within a week or so I'll be wearing contacts again. Almost four months in glasses when with a simple HSA the whole thing could have been avoided.

After my contact stop, I went and got my hair cut. And it's satisfactory, finally. Another thing that I put off too long. Everyone kept telling me about <EM>bad</EM> places to get hair cuts, and no one told me about <EM>good</EM> places. So finally, when someone mentioned this place last week, I decided that it might be the only good place in town so I'd better get it now before something tragic happens to stop it from being possible. 

I spent the afternoon finishing cleaning (by the way, I spent a good two or three hours cleaning last night) and calling creditors. You should have seen it! I called at least four or five people/agencies/hospitals/whatever. And I got a ton of bills paid and current. Just lots of bill paying.

And then Amanda and I went to OSU Federal Credit Union to try for a loan. An upcoming entry will describe the car/loan status. Just know... it happened.

And now I'm going to go relax, eat, and be merry. I'll write that upcoming entry either later tonight or after work tomorrow."

1. James Parmer suddenly had to get time off.

That has drained us of so many resources, it's ridiculous.

2. Andre's father died yesterday morning. He left work as soon as he heard and will not be back until <EM>at least</EM> Monday. Rich and I firmly expect him to take longer than that.

3. My parents have decided that this is the right time to take the car away.

5. Aside from #1 and #2, work has been going <EM>great</EM>.

6. Aside from #3 and #4, life outside of work has been going <EM>great</EM>.

Went to Spirit Mountain Casino with Sheryl -- kind of. Hit trips three times. Won two of the pots, folded pre-flop on the other! :)

Went to Ruby Tuesday but they were too busy, so we went to Michael's Landing. That food and service.. well worth the money and deserving of the high reputation.

Went to FM. $350 worth of grocery shopping. Should last us two weeks or so. And the beauty of that is - minimal impulse buying during that time. I really, really like the stock-up-on-everything way of life.

"event","Wow. A very productive day today. Microsoft Vista launch went smoothly. I felt pretty good about the presentation I made on my Vista endcap. With only 5 SKUs all requiring large keepers, I was pretty limited. But I did a decent job. And Courtney inspired me to have Amanda and Stephanie make me several red, yellow, blue, and green balloon bundles. Marcia would have been proud. 

What else? I got to throw lots of freight today, which I don't get to do terribly often. I'm happy about that. If I'm not making it clear, today was one of those ""in charge"" days where I really feel like I've exceeded at my job. 

What else? At the beginning of our FMTV, Courtney told me that he was being audited tomorrow for scheduling. He expected our schedule on his desk before opening tomorrow. Fine. I hadn't even done a bit of work on the schedule yesterday in consideration of the fact that Rich and I are both scheduled 7-5 tomorrow. Rich only does that when he plans to be off the floor the whole day. So I expected him to write the schedule tomorrow. But I grinned and bore it. At 4 I sat down and had a final rough schedule penned out by 5. It took me another hour and a half to write it in VLM, and work out the kinks and bumps that I hadn't seen when rough drafting. All and all, about 2 and a half hours to write the schedule, start to finish. Not bad if I say so myself! Hah! :) And that was the note that I ended my day on. A pretty good note, if you ask me. 

Here on the homefront, I've only had an hour but I got the kitchen picked up from last night, laundry started (and last night's finished!), and the cat's litter boxes emptied. How productive. 

And now I'm off to pick Amanda up, eat dinner, finish tonight's laundry, and call it a success of a day."

I always intuitively knew that it was the right way to do things, but I never actually knew that it was the <EM>standard. </EM>And with the cabinet organized, I was able to make a final and comprehensive list of what we have and don't have and then finish stickering fact tags. You see, I have the tags stickered green (green for go) if the corresponding product has all of it's accessories, etc in the back. I've stickered it red (for stop) if the item does not. And yellow when we have partial stuff. As I finished stickering, I also made a comprehensive list of items we need to acquire and organized that by item type. I didn't actually count the items, but I had a page worth of ""green"" and a page and a half worth of ""red"". Oy. In other words, I have a real project on my hands now, trying to either (a) track down missing accessories from manufacturers or (b) making duplicate displays and marking down ""missing parts"" displays to get our stockroom up to par.

But at least now I know what we have and what we don't have. It's a big project I have on my hands, but I now know what the project is. And frankly, it's the project that I've wanted to take care of since June. It's been too busy since August, and I'm very excited to put in some real work on it."

She seems to remember the best things about who I was back in those days. I wasn't always the best employee, and I look back and I could have driven her nuts with the schedule issues. But she always saw through that and past it and just adored me. And I her. So when we first talked after I came up here, she told me how proud she was of me. She expresses similar sentiments literally every time we talk. And for someone that I look up to as much as her to express such pride in me every time we talk, well, it makes my day to talk to her. 

I had the ""pleasure"" of telling several unpleasant people 'no' to their return requests. Overall, I guess it wasn't the best of days. I mean, people left and right wanting to return things outside of the scope of policy, and not being very accepting when I told them no. Hmmph. Give me a couple more days like today and I'll be another Felicia (or for that matter Shonna): no more apologetic looks, just hardass ""no"". I've gotten a lot better at that, and I'm getting better day by day at the whole ""you do it <EM>my</EM> way"" thing especially with Andre and James. I feel like I've got Gray down to some extent, and the part timers to a greater extent. Now I just need to be more consistent with Andre and James. But again, much better than even a couple of months ago. For instance, Andre had several things missed from the ad this morning, and I handled it very well. I handed him the ad, circled the mistakes, and told him that I expected them fixed by the time I got back from my break. And when I got back they were fixed. 

On another note, Brett got shelving up in the loft that we've been trying to get up for a long time. There's still work needed up there but some real progress has been made. If people can focus and do their jobs tomorrow, the dept and stockroom will be looking nice.

"event","Well I had a pretty good day yesterday. For starters, I felt like I'd had a day off. I got the kitchen picked up and laundry almost completely done by noon. So upon going to work, I'd already had a fairly productive day. When I arrived at work, I was greeted enthusiastically. I went straight away to putting iPods away and Rich gestured me to the OHP. ""Come over here. I have some big news for you,"" he said. Big news? As he passed by me, Gray told me that yes, it is very big news. I racked my brain. What news was <EM>that</EM> big? It hit me. Gray told me ""it is what you're thinking it is"", confirming it for me. Rich asked if I needed to sit down. 

New OHP machine.

I'm reminded of <A href=""http://ashlandsou.livejournal.com/2005/10/10/"" target=_blank>October '05</A>, counting down the weeks, days, hours, and minutes until Fuji Frontier time. My reaction was not over-the-top, either. Everyone who was told had similar reactions. Tim stopped by to shop in the evening and I first told him that our $50 gift cards had arrived. He was happy, but not crushed when I told him that Trish had the securely locked in her office and he'd need to see her directly for them when she was there. When I told him about the new OHP machine, he jumped up and down for joy. I think that says it all.

We've been told that the machine has an expected arrival around period 5 (June). Much can change between now and then, so I'm not going to count my chicken before they hatch. But I sure am excited at the prospect of the new machine. And the fact that the machine is in the corporate 2007 budget is encouraging, to say the least.

In other news, I spent the whole day yesterday working on resetting the camera batteries. Why'd it take so long? James or Andre, whoever started the project, didn't plan out quite enough space for the batteries that had to fit in the set. They were trying the ""build-as-you-go"" method to setting the POG. Maybe that method works for some, but if I build the POG first, and then set product to it next, I can have a 4 fooot section done in 2-4 hours, depending on the size of the section. So long story short, that much sucked. But I do enjoy working with the night folks. Their attitudes are good, even if I'm not huge fans of their work quality at all times. 

It's time to cut this entry short. Amanda and I have a double date of sorts with Andrew and Amy at the local Red Robin in... half an hour. And I'm not shaved!"

"event","<P>The one hour photo machine, and everything about it, has been nothing but trouble over the weekend. The 4""matte, 8""gloss, ""A"" side door, ""A"" side sensor, SRU unit, both USB readers, chemical replenishment sensors, and #7 roller were down at one point over the weekend. When I got in Friday morning, I was told that we were down and that RIMG would be in on ""Saturday or Sunday"" to fix it. Oh no they didn't! So I got right on the phone, and gave them a little Weber as I told Andrew. Anyway, long story short, I spent lots of time on the phone with them trying to get things fixed and basically making sure that they understood that I wasn't going to stop until I got my way and had my machine up and running in a time frame that I found acceptable for the business. And by 4 pm Friday we were operating again, although there were still problems. By 4 pm Saturday the only things ""down"" with the machine were: the ""A"" side sensor and the USB readers. Now I would like to see us get to the point where we can offer 5"" matte and 8 "" matte along with gloss for those sizes. Barring any major setbacks, hopefully we can get there before graduation season. If so, the investment would be worth it - enlargements are really popular then no matter where you go, and I can imagine that with the emphasis on student life here graduation season is probably a big deal. Heck, when I got here in late June last year, graduation was still a big deal - and it had been over and done with for weeks by then.

What else? Well, I continue to make project on my major dirt tour project while ensuring that everyone else makes progress on their own. My project? The bane of my existence at Fred Meyer since June - display manuals/accessories. I believe I have compiled a list of items that we have <EM>everything</EM> for in the back, and am marking the fact tags to denote which we have and which we don't so that we can have a little easier time when selling displays. Next step: get any stuff from the front into our file cabinet. Then print off any manuals that we're missing and get them with the rest in the back. Then alphabetize the cabinet by vendor and mark cabinet so that it can <EM>stay</EM> organized. Hopefully somewhere in there we'll have a new file cabinet coming to us. 

I'm staying busy at work. Outisde of projects we've kept our gross sales up. I close today and Thursday with Wednesday and Friday off. I'm looking forward to the shifts in some small way. Maybe I'll get a chance to get some work done on projects? But then again, today and Thursday are freight days. I won't have time for projects after freight. And on top of everything else, I've been falling asleep by about 9:30 or 10 lately. Being at work til 11:30? Doesn't sound like a smart idea. Oh well, we'll see. :0</P>"

In all, we wound up spending over $300. Lots of money, yes, but we have enough meat for 14 meals, and probably enough food for almost two full weeks. All we'll need to buy between now and the end of the month will be small bits of food. Not bad, really. 

Other than the shopping&nbsp;extravaganza, we each got a good bit of cleaning/organizing done. Amanda cleared a <EM>ton</EM> of old stuff out of the kitchen to make room for yesterday's shopping trip. And I got all of the Christmas stuff out of the house as well as Amanda's old clothes and tons of other little trash. Oh, and all the laundry got done yesterday. 

So today we're both free to relax. And we are doing just that. I think I'm going to get the kitchen picked up after this post so that it'll be clean for dinner time and manageable after dinner. No need to get out of the cleaning routine just because we're taking today easy, right? 

Oh and American Idol was on last night. I'm not a particular fan of that show, but I do so enjoy watching people embarass themselves. And last night there were lots of them. They even showed a couple of pretty good voices. But really, if you want to watch quality singers, the first episode of American Idol is not the show for you.

Don't get me wrong - Friday was still <EM>very</EM> icy and even with the new tires we still slid around quite a bit. But there were parts of town that had we not had those new tires, it would have been bad news. After the tires, Amanda and I spent some time killing time visiting her old spots. The mall (which though white trashy was better than Albany by far where malls are concerned). I think they call it the SuperMall. It doesn't deserve that much hype but it's just fine. After we went to the mall we stopped by her old wal-mart. By that point it was getting late so we hit up FM for cold weather gear and fishing licenses. By the time that that was through it was time to head back to Rayetta's. I took a nap, and at about 4:30 we headed out to meet Amanda's friends Stenna and Jeremy at the local Red Robin. From there we headed to a pool hall. The first hour or so of pool was fun, but they were playing Pirates at the pool hall and Stenna and Jeremy were pretty distracted so Amanda and I called it a night. Instead of going home, though, we hit up the Muckleshoot casino... which was a blast. It took upwards of an hour before a 3-6 table opened up for me but once it did I had great fun. Actually, I only played two or three hands past the flop. I should have played more hands since the guy next to me was getting increasingly intoxicated and loose while he played. He shot through $200 while I sat there. That wouldn't be that bad at a 10-20 table, but this was pretty small stakes. It took me a good hour and a half of active poker playing to go through $40. Anyway, I should have taken better advantage of his... ""charity"". After poker, I joined Amanda for some slots. We had a blast together. I'm even more excited for our anniversary being spent at a casino. We could spend hours together at slots and really spend a minimal amount of money.

Rayetta lives up a rather large hill and the trek up it to get to her house was exciting, to say the least. Very icy, with kids sledding - very dangerous! I was nervous about getting up. In fact, Amanda asked me to drive up the hill. We slid out several times but made it to her driveway eventually.

Once at her place, we enjoyed a quiet evening, quiet beginning to our vacation. We watched Sex and the City and chatted, and that was Thursday.

What an appropriate song to come on for this post.</P>"

Vacation starts today. I need it! I'm going to go get ready to drive up to Washington. Wish me lots of luck.

I'm very happy with Golan, Brett, and Andrew right now. They had the place looking really nice last night when Amanda and I stopped by and were still working hard. How cool."

"event","<P>Today was not my favorite of days. Makes up for yesterday, I guess. Everyone was needy today. I had one woman who purchased our last Sony DVD/VCR combo from last year yesterday. She came in today because the remote wouldn't program . So I spent a good twenty minutes trying to program it, followed by ten minutes on the phone with Sony's 1-800 number. Turns out, the remote we gave her is incompatible with that machine. So I tried getting ahold of Chris Shipley (assistant buyer for that category and one of my favorites from the MO). No luck - he's at an electronics convention all week. And Kyle, buyer for that category, was out of the office for the day. So I let the customer know that it would be a few days until we can take real action on the player and that we'd let her know as soon as we knew anything. She took a customer comment card home with her. That was about the best thing to happen all day. I felt like Felicia with an old man today. He had a telephone that he'd purchased but the volume didn't adjust on the unit he purchased. He spent 3 minutes telling me the story, and I finally cut him off - ""what do you want me to do for you?"" I asked. Just... lots of neediness today. Fortunately my employees weren't too needy but they were in bad moods, and uncooperative. Parmer especially. I'm going crazy trying to get people (him especially) to comply with the whole ""nothing behind the counter"" thing. And with tomorrow my last day before vacation, I question how stern Rich will be about that. On top of that, I've spent the last few days nailing the whole ""dirt tour"" thing into people's heads. Heather's gone along with it alright, but I fear that Rich's ""dirt tour"" standards will be lower than mine, and that in my eyes nothing will get done to advance that cause while I'm away. 

Lots of stressing about how it will be when I come back.What'd Marcia say about that yesterday? Basically, she gets things ahead before she goes so that when she comes back, all she has to do is read her email and respond. And I have read and signs well under control and I have ad audits complete through next week. The posted the two following weeks at the end of my shift today, so I'll get them done tomorrow, and I'll be effectively ahead on those when I get back. As far as the rest is concerned, well, that's why I take a vacation, so I can get away from it. Okay, time to get away from this entry, at least for long enough to pick Amanda up...</P>"

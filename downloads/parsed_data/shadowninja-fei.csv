Been watchign the Tudors lately, good series, if not historically inaccurate in some points it's just entertaining. Hoping to get a good amount of time off next week to go hang with my friends in low rain. Not much else going on, more people need to talk to me!!! i get bored easy on the interweb. you know my aim's, shadowninjafei."

"event","So i finally beat FF12 a while back and have been meaning to write what i feel about it. Don't read if you don't want lawl spoilers. 

[spoiler]Basically the whole premise is that long ago, when the gods created the humes, they shortly learned that the humes ambition and greed was to much for Ivalice. After years of war, the gods decided it was time to take matters into their own hands. Naming a hero of ivalice, the dynast king they gave him the power of nethecite, stones powerful enough to destroy entire countries. With the netecite and the magical swords, he united the entire world, as the gods commanded and so it was with magic stones and their hands in history, the gods manipulated hume history to keep them inline when ever they felt like they were getting out of hand. each major kingdom having one of the stones. Foward to years before 12, and  Cid balthansa finds out about the stones other countries have.As the empire extends, it gains a hold of some of them, using them to create artificial nethecite, magic stones with out the need for nature or gods to empower them. Seeking more of the stones, at the behest of Cid, the empire attacks Nabradia, where the power of one of the stones is let loose, destroying the country. After that, the empire turns it's eye towards Rabenastre, hoping to get the stone they possess. To what end was all this? cid, and Vayne solidor wished for one thing. After learning about the gods control on history and their power over humes from the dark god Vena, traitor to the gods, they decided that enough was enough. it was time for people to take back history into their own hands, not let the gods control them any more. And so goes the rest of the story of final fantasy 12. Her kingdom ruined by the empire, Princess ashelia  Sets out to find power enough to fight the empire. Coming upon her own nethecite and the two swords granted by the gods that could destroy the stones. In geruvegan her destiny made manifest, she was to be the new dynast king, destroy the empire and return the world to what the gods felt it was to be. She did not, but instead fought with her own power against the empire, firstly destroying the sun cyst. The stone from which all nethecite was cut, and freeing the world from the curse of the stones. Vayne, wished to see himself as the new dynast king, but one for which humes would follow into a new era without gods. And so the rebelion led by the Marquis ondore challenged the empire, lead by the flagship Bahamut, where Vayne and ashelia fought. Their goals the same, but means different, so inthe end did one have to die. However the empire needed an heir, or the would would be divided by civil war, so it was that Larsa solidor was named new emperor.[/spoiler]

SO yeah.. can you really say you don't feel bad for Vayne and what he was trying to accomplise? would you do the same thing, if you knew what he knew?.. i think i would, if i knew our lives were controlled and history pre determined by the gods, and had the power to allow humanity it's own destiny. I couldn't say i would not do the same.. would you challenge the gods themselves for what you beleive in?"

"event","So me and nate have started playing alundra to see if it's as awsome as we remember. It is. Game isn't as hard as we remembered, but then again one would hope we've gotten smarter at puzzle solving as we've gotten older. The story is still good, and so many sad deaths. Just finished kline's dream ( DAMN YOU ICE PILLARS), death rate is at 6 people so far.  Playing it has made me sad it will never get a good sequal, and even more sad that so many people will never play it, regulated to thinking legend of zelda is the best adventure game ever made , OMG !!!11!1!!!1
seriously, ALundra kicks the shit out of zelda is almost every way. Oh well, at least i get to enjoy it."

I've been tagged,once I counter tag you, you have to write a blog with six random facts about yourself. In the end you need to choose six people to be tagged and list their names.


1. I read all of the lord of the rings books and many of steven kings books before I was 9.
2. I can speed read, which means i can go through sentences only picking out parts of the words down allowing me to read a several hundred page book in one night if I really tried.
3. I'm secretly a really big star wars nerd, i can probably tell you anything about the old republic, empire, or extended universe you want to know >.>.
4. I originally wanted to be an architect when i was younger.
5. When something makes me really upset i tend to tear up out of frustration since im not prone to just hit things or explode.
6. The first rpg i ever played was final fantasy mystic quest, it's a horrible game in retrospect.

So i figured i'd go through here and say something about each of the people i have on my buddy list, maybe put a link related to you.

parttimehanyou: your honest about what you think and that's awsome, and when it makes someone mad or hurt, even better cuz it's hilarious. You also sound like your turning 50 already, and hate all those damn kids and their loud music and their make out parties.

the_pillow: we've been friends for almost 4 years now and i still have a great time hanging out with you. Remember "" was that a foot?"" MUWAHA btw http://hitlermyspace.ytmnd.com/ secret taco nazi!! btw good times with http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/203189

Well just been playing Castlevania, curse of darkness on my modded x-box. it's actually a preaty fun game, they are definetly heading in the right direction with the 3d games, but something is still missing that the 2d ones have. If they could just get that down they would be solid. Im going up to Chigago tomorrow to visit my old friends Marsh and robin, and what turned into about 6 of us from ohio going up has turned into about 20-30 of our guild mates all meeting outside Chigago at a Wings place to hang out all day, >.> wow it'll be weird to meet a lot of the people i play with but they are all great people. Sadly some of the ones i wanted to meet can't come because of children/husbands/wives/work but that's life. I gotta start getting x-mas presents for every one, i preaty much figured out what im getting most people. Our new little kitten Auron(allyson's x-mas present) is a little bundle of cute mixed with hyper. When he's just laying around or being silly he's cute as hell but he likes to attack feet while your sleeping or eat books so we have to stop him from doing that.Any way im waiting for a call from Anthony to go see king kong so i'll update more when i get back."

"event","That is the name of my pet hedge hog , she is so cute it's crazy. of course she is still very scared of people, especially new people but im hoping she gets over it eventually. She is eating and drinking regularly so that is a good sign, she is also using her running wheel so she's getting excercise. It just sucks having a nocturnal pet when you have to be in bed by midnight. She freakin sleeps all day. On other stuff every one look at this link, WATCH IT , and then cry for america like you should ..http://www.piclibs.com/videos.php?id=72 . The daily show brings into perspective the ridiulous state of people within politics and politics within people in this country. Their coverage of the Liberal march on washington was hilarious, i love how objective and non sided they are, making fun of every one makes your views a lot more viable then being one sided, especially on such things. I recommend every one watch the daily show, and if it offends your political or religious views, stop and think why your not even able to laugh at yourself, your not perfect so get over it. Laughing will make things better in the long run and hopefully one day we'll all realize how dumb we really are most of the time, at least when our opinions overide common sense. And if you can watch the this week in god segment about hurricane Katrina being sent by god to punish the sinful. The best part, how televangilist said that the hurricane was brought down on the day of a gay pride march in the french quarter and was a sign that god was punishing the gays yet that was one of the least flooded and damaged areas, so apparenlty god loves gays and hates those adjacent to gays... good times. Hate and such.

Going up to lorain this weekend, should be fun, but no WoW will be annoying, at least it'll give me time to study Japanese. My social stratifications of people in society class is easy sauce, just a lot of general knowledge on racism and schemas within groups in America, nothing bad at all. Geography isn't to bad, a lot mroe math then i thought it would be but nothing beyojnd highschool knowledge. Japanese is going to kick my ass though, i need to really work harder at it, but even in this past week and a half i've learned a lot more about the language then i knew before, it's sweet to actually learn stuff and be challenged, but at the same time a bit annoying. Oh well ces't la vie. I'll figure something out to write about next time, but for now i say all my friends must see my cute hedgie and don't let yourself be blinded by your own beliefs to the larger world and that thing called common sense, it's a good friend to have.

P.S. Purple monkey dishwasher(10 pts to whoever knows where that quote is from)
oh i know, next time i'll put up this awsome article from the OSU paper about Ann Coulter, that stupid self rightious , cock juggling thunder cunt(name that quote too)."

"event","Ok so it wasn't the day after, you can all kiss my ass! Any way life has been good, College started, and getting up early sucks like no bodies buisness. Japanese class is really fun, but i know i'm going to really have to try because they don't slow down for anything and I WANT to do well in the class, so i guess i'll just put the extra effort into it. My psych class looks fun, no textbook, just lots of books about inequality and people in america trying to live better then they can afford. Our apartment is almost completely done, just a few figues and posters left, it is teh awsome. Tomorrow i go to get my pet baby hedghog(so cute) and play some more WoW table top. I'll post some meaningful post tomorrow about either 1)evolution vs intelligent design or 2) idiotic religious fanatics in america who say that the hurricanes are gods way of destroying the sinful cities of america and are a warning to us all. YES YOU FUCKS BECAUSE GOD GIVES US DAYS OF WARNING!! god i hate those people*stabs televangilist in the face* oh i also started working out, and am sore, but i really and to get in better shape so im gonna suffer and go back again monday, the schools work out area is the size of a freaking building At LCCC, actually it's a LOT bigger, and has 3 pools. Teh awsome. and for those of you wondering i will be back up the weekend of the first so i can show off my baby hedgehog and hang out."

"event","Yes yes it's been a long time since I've updated. Quick overview, I'll make more meaningful post tomorrow.
Otakon was fun, good to catch up with old friends, and friends from anime. Super happy anime was split into two, although the most noise wasn't always from the kids :P. Two of my best friends have left, one for the land of china where adventure abounts- Jonathan. The other for Chicago where a 75k a year job awaits-Marsh. Sucks because the biggest reason I had to go back to Lorain was to play table top games and 40k with Marsh and all those people. Sean and jilly bean are going out, never saw that coming but what ever makes them happy. Me and Allyson have moved down to Columbus, took us a week to get cable and internet, that sucked. Life here is really good, Lots of WoW. Clint, Nate, and Anthony are really cool, and we've been hanging out a lot. Gotta look for a job, job's suck, hopefully i can work at EB games for less suckness. Our guild in WoW absorbed another guild, Twisted hand of fate, so now we are one big guild of about 70 real people, 120 charachters. Our apartment is awsome, gotta start puttting up posters, anime figures abount. Anime Palace store down here in columbus, it rocks. Naruto dub hurts my hears, mainly just Naruto's voice and the shitty ass opening and closing. Gotta hang out with anime friends more next time I'm up in lorain, and Prince of Persia is an awsome game. Huricane sucks, some one in our guild was stuck in it but he's ok, another guild mate had a daughter this week. Daily show is hilarious, Mind of Mencia is hilarious, politically correct people are dumb, and John Stewart should be our next president. More important stuff tomorrow."

"event","Well tonight is my last night here in japan, so i figured i would post the last of the things i learned while here.

1. hentai stuff is expensive.
2. you always win at games when you do not try.
3. The only thing that can beat 2 Arnolds is two Jesus`
4.There have been two recorded deaths due to large boots.
5.The yakuza run a lot of operations in Kobe for some reason
6.Allsyon only remembers things told to her 5 times.
7. there are people more pale then allyson in existance.
8. Jason has a clone.
9. Sumos are more flexible than I am.
10. Advent children is coming out 9/15.
11. Other people from Europe make fun of the french as much as we do.
12. High heels and stockings are common fashion.
13. Japanese children and babies are more cute then any others.
14. Jackass penguins do exist.
15. No one REALLY wants to live in africa.
16. It is ok to listen to a remake of the mario theme song in  a fancy resturant.
17. The japanese like putting vowels at the end of words.
18. Snoopy and disney are popular here.
19. Buddhist temples rock any other religions places.
20. Bleach has a good number of fans here but is not one of the most popular series.
21. People will just talk to you on the street in smaller towns for now reason and practice their english.
22. Pillows should not be made of beads.
23. It is fun to listen to japanese people curse in english.
24. paying 3 dollers for a 1.5 liter of soda makes you cry inside.
25. seeing small water melons for 30 dollers, and 2 apples for 6 makes you cry more.
26. Americans need to walk more.
27. Japan is a great place but has it's own share of problems. Lots of pachinko gambling, hookers, and the selling of people happen in the larger cities.
28.Japanese keyboards suck.
29.  A good number of women wear kimonos in public as their every day cloths.
30. Where as the japanese look good wearing the traditional clothign of their people, we would look stupid in frilly shirts and big wigs."

Is it just me or is that sadly close to realistic? I would probably definetly die to laced pocky, and i would blame allyson or someone i knew, because they would probably do it.
Well not much here, as usual, can't wait to go to anime tomorrow, even if it's just for 2 shows i'll get to go for the first time in god knows how long. Also i can't wait to start working on my costume, i really need to get a hold of Mallory and see if she is interested, as well as think of a place we can freakin work on them. I finally beat La puccelle before writing this, and i must say it's one of the my favorite endings in a long time. It tells what happens to everyone afterwards, who gets with who and what now, some deaths on parts of good and bad guys, lots of life. It's not an overly sad ending, but not a completely happy ending either, it's a very realistic ending and that's awsome. Now I am going to try to finish dark cloud 2, i got about half way through that before stopping so i hope that doesn't take to long. Next is front mission 4 then star ocean 3 and i've cought up, since i play silent hill 4 on and off any way.
Well school ends tomorrow except for finals so those who i don't see there, take care and hopefully i'll see you over break. !!"

"event","As usual, nothing much going on in my life, and as usual no one ever comments on it,.. im a sad panda. On that note, never get a side of panda with your fast food order, Pvponline explains the dangers of such. Any way just been playing a lot of WoW and la puccelle. Also been playing Naruto for gamecube. That's about all i got going on, finals are next week, and i can guarentee and A in 2 classes, and either an A or B in the other, but im going to have to try REALLY hard to ge a B or C in Anatomy and physiology. I really need to stop slacking off in classes, i also really need to stop procrastiniating with stuff. I think now that i don't work any more, im goign to put more time and effort towards getting in better shape. 
Im Hoping soon to get back to working on my shino costume so i can have it at it's leetest by ohayocon, especially since i leave for florida in 2 weeks, i gotta get on the ball. More of that procrastination crap kicking me in the ass. Oh well im gonna get back to killing big headed funny looking gnomes."

"event","Well after a while I am posting agian, and still not much going on. I got a new car, a Mazda 98 protege it runs really well, now if only I could sell my old POS. Also i finally schedueled for my classes next semster, yay lots of fun indeed. Nothing really exciting ever going on with me, been playing a lot of World of warcraft in the open beta that ended tonigh,and I can't wait till tuesday to play the real thing. Also been playing a lot of la puccelle and I only have one chapter left in the game. It's really cool, a lot more serious and darker then disgaea, but still really funny at times. 
  Oh and i seriously hate my x-box, it being a version 1.6 makes modding it a bitch and a half because they haven't realeased any new bios for that version since microsoft changed the sound card drivers and video ones too, those poll smokers.... It's already been a month and no luck, but im lucky my x-box hasn't blown up, if you look on the interent people have totally trashed their x-box's trying to mod version 1.6's frying the hard drive or just making it so it never turns on... i guess im lucky in that. im planning on maybe buying an older used one, putting the insides in my cool green case, and modding it. Then put the new ones in the old x-box case and use that for live, since microsoft has been smacking down modders on live like bad red headed step children... oh well i'll sleep on it and give it another week. I still have some games to beat any way."

"event","Not much going on this past week, Going to school, trying my hardest to get a freakin B in Anatomy and phisiology and crying that I don't .. well not really just blarging. Yesterday was Allyson's b-day so we just hung out most of the day but I got to go to anime, and that was cool. I can't wait till I can go back all the time.. there just needs to be a way to kill all the little kids and people who talk to damn much. That's always been something that's bugged me. Today we went out for Japanese Hibachi, it was so good, and then came back to my house to eat icecream and watch slayers movies.. mm fatning but very enjoyable to just lay there with your girlfriend and watch funny anime. I ran into Adrian and rico at the mall, hadn't seen them in a while so it was cool to play DDR with them, but i've realized i need to play a lot more,these past 2 weeks without playing has kicked my ass. I also need to start planning my trip to florida this x-mas. Tomorrow is halloween, my favorite elven(aka evil) influenced holiday of the year.. YAY evil. 
  Gah i have way to many video games to beat and not enough time,i think im going to go play some La puccelle right now. Oh and if your wondering about the name of this entry it's because im listening to OC music remixes, and the one just happened to be a Mega man 2 song when i started typing this. BWAHA"

"event","So yeah.. I'm posting again.. woot. Any way it's been a while and a lot has happened but none of it that important exept for 1) saving the world 2) ninja's 3) more ninja's and 4) otakon .. oh yeah and school but that's to kill time between hanging out with my friends. ANY WAY iI really dont' have much to say, Allyson's birthday is next week and she's going to love her present because it is awsome. Also I hate Wizards of the coast and their ability to cost me money by putting out new D&D books. Terror tunnels is this week and I'm probably going to be helping out anime club(95% chance) if I can get out of work in time since all that stupid is going on in the RP club. But I digress, this is not the place for such things, after all life is more important then the sad and bad things, to much fun to be had. I can't wait to see Malory in her costume, I wish I could cos-play with her but my costume needs some more work. Im definetly going to be putting the extra effort to make it as good as possible before ohayocon, I want to be teh 133t3st Shino evah. Alright well enough dumb for now, i'll probably be updating regularly again although no one really cares, lets see how many people post a reply, I'm betting 1.2 since a midgit will try but fail."

"event","Just like one of those damned AA meetings . >.> <.<. Yes yes I know it's been a while since I updated, but you know what? who cares!. There is about what? 4 people who read this thing any way. This is more for me so I'll update when im good and ready.. wait why am I saying all this, no it's the reverse Pyro!!! *dies*. Any way, I just got done reading a bunch of manga, new excel saga, berserk, started Rebirth, and of course my favorite GTO. The more I read it the more I wish I could be like Onizuka, he is truly a man who follows his heart, and as is evitend, not always his brain. Ok maybe I'd follow my brain a bit more then him,but the general idea of always helping people and doing it how it needs to be done, even if it's not how it should be done is great. Sometimes it takes crazy things to  make everything go right and I wish I could fix all my friends problems like that. Plus I'd be diesel and indestructible.. hehe. 
   Started my finals today, Human sexuality was preaty easy, so was today's civilitations Final. Tomorrow's Human Growth and Development shouldn't be to bad, I'm just worried about my human ecology and my American Cinema ones, my grade in those classes is sub par mainly because of my slacking. I talked to a carrier counsler on wensday and got a good push in the direction i want to go, as it seems I'm either going to be staying here for another 2 years to get my bachlors in psychology through CSU and the university partnership, or finishing my associates this fall, and going to OSU next january. Either way will be fine with me. Both have their ups and downs but I know that what ever path I choose i'll do it to my fullest capabilities. Finally getting this much direction about my future has lifted a great burden off me. I've felt like I was doomed not to go any where, afriad of leaving what is and has been because i had nothing in front. But finally I stopped being a whinny bitch and have been doing what i needed to move ahead one way or another. Ya me, i must take Onizuka's wisdom to heart. We can not blame others for our problems, and we definetly can not blame how others turned out on ourselves or peoples besides them. Those who blame others for being bad or the type of person they are try to hide the guilt that is rightly theres. Blame yourself, learn from it and move on. No point in dwelling on things. Next i must learn to ride a dolphin and suplex people. Well i should be updating more often now that summer is out, so if your read this, just leave a hello and let me know im not talking to the void of darkness.... who just called."

"event","yes, the subject statment is true, my house is fucken cold as balls(as my cousin Erick would say). Any way not much going on here, school is wittling down and just got done with a long day of work, freakin people calling from all over town an hour before we close for deliveries. On wensday I finally talked with Lindsey about the problems i was having, and by talk we preaty much just yelled at eachother, which is something we never really did but for some reason was needed. Any way things with her are working out so hopefully we can be good friends again soon. I've been reading my D&D books like a mad man realizing there is a lot of stuff in version 3.5 i didn't realize, like why dwarf fighters are so tough ... god im a dork :P.
Any way Robin sent out this e-mail that your supposed to send to your friends asking questions about yourself and i sent it and here is some of the most common answers as well as the most likely true or most funny.

Am i shy or outgoing?
most common answer was shy; most likely true answer is shy at times, and other times outgoing 

Any good nicknames for me?
Most common as well as funniest and seemingly most true answer was. : ass hat or chode. followed by dirty mexican.

Am i a rebel or do i follow the fules.
Most common answer was that I follow the rules; most likely true answer was that I only pretend to follow the rules so know one sees how i break them.

If I was stranded on a desert island what would I bring.
Most common and probably true answer : Asian school girl, hehe. Funniest answer was BOOOOBERRRY."

"event","Yes yes it has been a long time since I've posted anything on this damn journal. Sorry about that but I've been kind of blah and the past month or two have sucked like a twelve year old whore. Today im rather good, went to see the Crystal method last night, and the concerts of fucken awsome. It was the first really good day i've had in a long time. I'll explain. See for about the past 2 months i've felt very down and uncaring about a lot of things, many of my friends have problems and situations coming up that I just really don't want to deal with, usually I do but lately I don't. Most day's i feel down, except when im with Marsh,Robin, Sean, Laura,Sarah Bookshar, or Alyson. Because of this i've been avoiding time or doing things with many other people simply because i don't feel comfortable or happy around them. The thing is with my closer friends i don't feel really happy, just normal. But I guess when your feeling low that feeling normal is thus feeling happy, or some such. Any way I really don't know what to do about it and the last time i went to the doctor I asked him about it and he said i might be Clinically depressed. Of course I refuse to go on medications for that kind of thing because it should be taken care of and happy pills just hide problems not fix them. Yesterday was the first really HAPPY day I have had in such a long time I had almost forgot what it was like. It has given me a new desire to change things for the better as well as be happy again, for me and my friends. I've said some things about people not really out of truth but more out of a lack of caring or understanding. If you consider yourself my friend and are reading this but feel that i've kept you outside or anything please understand it's nothing personal, most are in this grouping right now. I don't want to loose any friends, and am going to take care of things but if i loose a friend or two along the way, so be it. I would rather loose a friend or two then all of them. Please understand why im being aloof lately and may be for a bit longer. I only feel really happy when listening to my music, or im with Alyson so I do those more then anything else. I also sleep a lot but im still always tired, a sign that this is more then just an emotional thing. Right now im studying for my human sexuality class. Wish me luck!! ^.^ . Until I figure out what I want, and who I want there, and how im going to be while there please bare with me and understand the following things im going to try to reduce my overall stress and negative outlook on people.

1) Please don't ask me for a ride unless im going to the place you want to go,I really hate being a choufer, especially for those who don't pay or rarely do me the same favor. I understand car's break down and bad shit happens, but that's one thing and being a 20 + year old with out a car is another and I really don't feel like looking down on people who should be better then this. If I was a  chauffeur I'd be making a hell of a lot more money and gas ain't cheap either. Also i drive for a living and more then anything im REALLY getting sick of driving when I don't have to.

2) please don't ask me for money, I've already been very hurt over something to do with money and right now every one can basically kiss my ass when it comes to this. My money is just that, MINE, I work for it, I earn it, I spent it. If I offer money is one thing, but don't come to me for anything I'm sick of people thinking I'm this bank that is always open for buisness and can be forgotten or fucked over. My money was earned with work or blood, yes I have quite a bit of it but you know what; that money was earned with a human beings life and if you don't understand that you can really go fuck yourself.

3) Don't talk bad to me about other people unless I ask what the problem is. This has been a problem since highschool, I've always been friends with a lot of people and many of them weren't friends with each other or outright hated each other. I don't like hearing bad things about my friends, even from my friends. Remember I'm still a person's friend if your not and don't appreciate bad talk behind their backs, just as u don't appreciate it about me and I'm sure you don't about you. Say things to a person's face, it gets things done with quicker. And if your the one pulling shit behind backs and doing stuff you shouldn't and get caught then you fucked yourself over, don't shit where you eat.

4) Please don't assume you understand anything about my dreams, hopes, morals, or desires right now. I barely understand or know them and if I don't how in the hell can you. Remember what they say happens when you assume!! Especially don't think you know how I feel about a situation or person with out asking me because your just going to cause more trouble then is needed and I really hate cleaning up after other people. 

Take care of yourselves and I'll take care of me, right now I'm going to ask very little from others and expect the same in return. As I open back up to my actual friends these things will disapper and hopefully I can be the smart ass, crazy, open, wild, laughing Ian I used to be who loved to be with everyone and keep people together. Please understand I'm a human being too, I make mistakes and feel sad, I cry and hate myself and hate others and am angry with them. But friends get angry with each other, the thing is real friends move on. Sometimes I may not be able to move on, or it may not seem like I can't but I'm only human. Give me some fucken slack. Now if you'll all excuse me im going to talk to a few of my friends who appreciate me for me, don't look for all the things I do wrong, or put down my way of existing, and I know without a doubt care about me and not themselves. Remember this isn't directed at any one person, I've just lost a bit of faith in almost every one. Give me time to get it back, Rome wasn't built in a day. Until then you all take care of yourselves. Love me or leave me, your choice ^.^ we all have free will, and giving up our ability to choose or not choosing is still a choice. Remember that boys and girls, you have no one to blame but yourself, and if your really pathetic or sad blame god. You know since you won't take responsibility for yourself.

Now.... zombies got a steel pipe to the head coming. MUWAHAHAHA"

"event","So yeah.. I must say Crystal chronicles for game cube has finally warented the purchase of said system. As they say in leet talk "" i+ 4r3 r40wk20r"" or some such. I finally asked allyson out which makes me very happy, she's awsome and i really enjoy being around her. 
Our saturday camarilla vampire game was freakin awsome, so much fucking over going on it's sick, no one trust any one, and it's all people playing it out, no fighting or anything it's the best. Speaking of roleplaying i really want to find a place me and my friends can play our vampire games every saturday besides the college and just say fuck it to the whole club thing, it's a lot of work very few of us do, and even more so work we DON'T want to do, since we don't care about the money, just playing out game. i swear i will find a place and save us all a lot of trouble and stress, this is my goal."

"event","I know it's a bit after friday, but whatever who's keeping track ?  >.>...<.<. Any way I learned that there really are good people out there who do nice things just to be a good person, really made me look at people differently. On friday I went to the mall with Lindsey and was going to be late for work, and my car was still in Amherest, so instead of being an hour late, we went to my job, and I was going to use her car to deliver, well i know HOW to drive stick, I just get nervous, and especially in her new car, and making her late to stuff, and well as you can guess being late and all  of it kind of made me have a panic attack while driving to a delivery. Well the coustomers were VERY nice, giving me some juice, and letting me sit and calm down, and one of the guys who looked like a drinking construction worker who you would not usually give the time of day to offered to drive me back to my job out of the goodness of his heart. A bit odd of a guy, but really nice where it counted which made me remember not to judge a book by it's cover. He really did save me and helped  more then I think even he realized because I was on the verge of tears since the panic attack was so bad. I've only done that once, when my mom died, and I don't think I will every cry as much as I did that day. But any way, it was nice to meet a good person and makes me want to help others even more, simply because, if your nice to all you meet, one day some one else like you is going to help you out. I'm going to try to be a little better of a person, and that means for myself as well.      
    I really need to just suck it up and do what makes me happy, and right now that means asking out Allyson, since yes every one and their mom knows I like her but it's ok! plus im glad im going to class more now, makes me feel better about school. School, job, and hopefully soon a girlfriend. life is really good for me, oh can't forget lots of awsome friends whom I love. 
   On a more annoying note, we might be lossing my awsome house soon, im not sure yet, but it's sad, not a problem because getting a place isn't hard, just I love this house and all it offers. I will miss walking in my woods... I should do that some day soon."

"event","no no , this isn't going to be anxty, I just watched the crow and I liked that quote, plus Brandon lee is a sex beast.. i mean.. good actor :P. any way things are going preaty well for me, can't say the same for my friends, my best friend Tim and his four year girlfriend are having problems, and for some reason, Lindsey's new boyfriend Will broke up with her for kind of the same reason's me and her broke up, but out of the blue, and well i guess her ex-boyfriend now. Any way it sucks because she wasn't even expecting it and it's really hard on her, So if you read this, please try to help her out for me. 
  Me? im doing well i guess, very little sadness remains about anything, just life in general but no more then usual, almost always doing stuff and got a big smile on my face because of good friends and good times. Work sucks sometimes but that's about it, Vampire games are fun as always with my Wavas Sydney and my Ventrue Edmund. School is alright, just hard to get up for my eight a clock classes. There is a girl who's caught my attention quite a bit, and that's good because she's cool as hell and really fun to hang out with, not going to say any names as of yet. Also tomorrow me and Allyson will cardboard tube duel to decide who wins our little battles thus far we are equal. 
  I hope Matt Smith's party this saturday is fun since there is no vampire game,.... a weekend with out roleplaying, i don't know what im going to do !!! NOOOOO.
  Only real thing on my mind is how i sometimes wish people knew me better, or what made me who I am and what it is I am. I've only known almost all my friends for two years and sometimes feel a bit outside of what is and was. but ces't la vie i guess , no big deal."

well first off im happy because Marsh and Robin got engaged on tuesday, that wedding is going to rock the cashba baby. It'll be great times for all. Unfortunetly my friend Nick also died on tuesday, so that sucks like a good prom date, that means a lot for those of you who 1) didn't go to prom 2) weren't very good prom dates.

I really should go to that music cafe and check out the sexy asian girls. Oh next week is Ohayo-con, i can't wait, Jeremy could introduce me to these sexy asian girls in this band that's going to be playing there, plus lots of cute cos-play girls. MUWAH for me indeed. also lots of anime and video games and other assorted dork stuff, hopefully i'll win either the guilty gear XX or soul calibur 2 contest, wish me luck all!!"

"event","well ya for me I'm single in every way possible now.. *sigh* ces't le vie i guess. oh well, no point in sulking any longer, after all there is much pirating to do and much asian booty to chase after YAR.. which reminds me, my plan for ohayo-con, which is convinetly ten days away, is to get me a sexy cos-player. I talked to kevin about the sexy Ayame next year and how we would ninja battle over her after all. Alas, my new years resolution will be real, i will get me a sexy asian girl. 

  On the up side one day i know me and lindsey can be friends again, im still mad at her for now and i saw her today for the last time since she was in the hospital with menengitis, if you know her phone number please call and wish her well. I decided that i'm not going to see or talk to her for a while and move on, and i really think that will be best for us as friends, her friendship would be worth any amount of time, and maybe one day we will be back together. Like she said, never is a long time, but im not going to look for it, just let it happen. First love... very fun in that way that lets you know your alive.
   Finally Jason is going to help me make my page layout sexy Motoko.. mmmm samuri girl = ownz. i can't wait. Next journal entry will be a quick overview of everything i talk stupid about for those who still don't understand moi.. i need some friends haha i got tons though. and excel saga rocks, so much stupid.. i  love it."

"event","I'm just one star, 
shining among billions of others.
 we all glow for a brief time, then fade 
making room for new, brighter stars. 
One day i will shine brighter then all the others, 
even if just for a brief second, so that 
everyone will know my star, 
and thus leave my mark on eternity.

sorry, just a thought that's been running through my mind all day, today i feel very hurt, and mainly just fucked over. It's that feeling when you love someone so much, you just want to choke them to death and watch the life leave them, their eyes staring back at yours, that final look into their real thoughts.... gawd i sound like a goth, kill me now!!! oh no that sounded gothy too NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.....
i'll get better, the sun will always rise tomorrow as they say, good thing not many entries will be like this. on a brighter note i got a cell phone ^.^ yay me."

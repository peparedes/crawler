"event","Oh my goodness, after posting the 100 Things Challenge a little while ago, I realized that it really HAS been a long time since I last posted.

Where have I been?

Well, I've been hanging around working on various projects, and getting settled in to the same old, same old.

I no longer have to work in downtown Detroit, which is always a major boost, no matter how you look at it. I'm back to the same location I was working from before the ""move of doom."" I'm loving this so much more!!

I've been working on several quilts over the last several months, so much so that I've been neglecting the writing aspect of my life.  But the good news is that I'm almost finished with one quilt top (working on the setting triangles), have another top completed (well, except for a few borders - which may or may not be added), AND working on three more so I'm feeling somewhat accomplished.

As for writing, I'm feeling pretty accomplished as well despite the fact that I've been neglecting it lately. I managed to get two major projects done with rave reviews for one of them before the writing well ran dry.

As always, all is not lost.  My muse is getting antsy and already there are several more projects I'd like to get working on again, so we'll see if I manage to get anywhere with them.

In the meantime, things are going well with me.

How are things with you?"

"event","There's a new challenge running amok in LiveJournal and it sounds like a great opportunity for me to find something to write about and to post in this journal, so I'm jumping in with both feet, because seriously. We all know it's time I came up with something. :)

The challenge is to make 100 posts on any subject I want, and I thought it might be good for me to write about... are you ready for this?? *majestic drum roll*  ""100 amazing people on the autism spectrum.""  

Yes, you heard right.  One hundred people!  And yes, I'm aware that I don't know 100 people who have been diagnosed with any form of autism, but with resources like the internet and local connections, I think I may have a good chance of finding enough people to cover this challenge.  I'll probably just start with family and work my way outward.

Besides, there's no time limit!! :)

I also plan to talk about amazing autism advocates while I'm at it, so I'll have some filler material when things get sparse. 

I won't be posting daily, and this thing may fizzle out, but it's worth a try!

It's just that I happen to spend more time on my other journal. I get comments on that journal. People read my stuff and let me know that they read my stuff. It's more interesting when I can feel like I'm a part of something.

So I drifted away from this blog.  I'll keep trying to come up with something to write about here, even if no one reads it, but until I come up with a definite purpose, the posts will probably be few and far between.

"event","You know, I'm going to stop talking about the things I plan to do, and just let you all know when I actually get whatever I plan to do done. All this, ""I'm hoping to get things done"", but never getting them done is starting to wear thin.  My last post for example, which was in October by the way, talks about how I was going to finish a certain quilt top by the end of November... not to mention NaNoWriMo (which I always lose anyway, so that may not count lol), the outline from the post before that...

*sigh* Let's just say that I have a huge amount of ambition, which can be good sometimes. Right? Just not a whole lot of the stick-with-it-already ambition to keep up on things.  

That's okay though. The good news is that I DID get the articles and stories done, and on time, I might add. :) Strict deadlines do help sometimes.

Speaking of deadlines, here's the new list of projects that I need to get done by a certain time or else:

<lj-cut text=""Click here if you are interested in my current writing schedule. Otherwise..."">
<b>January</b><ul>
<li>How-to Write Article</li>
<li>1,000 word story for a contest (maybe two stories - depends on whether I get kicked off during the next round or not)</li>
<li>I didn't sign up for this one ficathon, but I thought I might try out one of the prompts and write something for it first, then sign up for it after the story is done. Not too kosher, but this way, I won't feel bad if I don't get the story done.</li></ul>

<b>February</b><ul>
<li>A ""short"" story for an anthology I contribute to on a regular basis.  The story I have planned for it seems like it's going to be a long one, so I may have to really tweak that thing to make it fit into the short story category.</li>
<li>A nonfiction article that I need to write for a class that I'm taking.  This shouldn't be too hard, I've been writing nonfiction articles, essays and what have you for most of my life.  I just need to find the subject and I'll be all set!</li>
<li>Depending on whether I survive the two rounds of the challenge I mentioned for January, I'll be writing for that too.</li></ul>
</lj-cut>

Whew! That sounds like a lot, but considering that I have plenty of time in between the ""assignments"", I should be okay - even if I do stress out when the deadlines get near.

Which reminds me of a question that Sara asks me all the time: Why do I sign up for these things if it's going to stress me out so much when the deadline nears?

My answer?  Because writing is so much fun, especially the fiction part of it! I love it even when I stress. Plus, I'm practicing my craft every time I write something, getting better at it as I go, so yeah. As long as the muse cooperates, I'll keep writing and signing up despite the deadlines.  :D

Now if only I could get paid for it..."

As most of you know, I'm working in downtown Detroit now. Not extremely happy about it, but I guess it's better than nothing.  I just need to figure out how to avoid those ***** traffic jams and I'll be all set.

In writing news, I'm working on finishing up a how-to article, then I need to concentrate on writing two short stories for commitments I signed up for, and in the meantime, finish up a 500-word character description to submit for another commitment.  All this by next weekend!  Eeep!!  Actually, it's doable, I just need to find time to really concentrate on this stuff.

I am also nearly done with one of the quilts I've been working on for awhile now.  I really hope to have the top pieced by the end of November, and I'll post pictures of it when it's done.

Of course, I did commit to NaNoWriMo again this year. ... ... Oh, who am I kidding?  With all the ""non-writing"" I'm going to be doing next month, I'll have plenty of time to finish that quilt!"

"event","Been writing again.  Lots of short stories and a few articles written and posted in the various online communities that are interested in that kind of stuff. 

The good news is that after months of research, I finally figured out the ways and means of creating an outline for the unfinished ""ideas"" stuck in my head.  There are various methods of outlining out there, and I think I may have to try them all to see which one works best for me.  But yeah.  I'm leaning toward the Summary method, mainly because I don't necessarily have to know the ending of those stories up front. I mean really now. How the heck can anyone know the ending of a story until they get to it???

Ahem. *cough*

Anyway, I realize that most people do indeed know the entire story before writing it out.  I just don't happen to be one of those people. So it will be interesting to see if outlining will help.

In related news:  It's <a href=""http://nanowrimo.org"">NaNoWriMo</a> time again! I know, I know. The collective groans are heard loud and clear. :) But a friend of mine is going to sign up again this year, and I think I may go ahead and join her. We all know I won't succeed, but it is a lot of fun and it doesn't hurt anyone when I join. You guys just get to hear all about my enthusiasm at the beginning - and the ""Meh. Lost again,"" noises I make when it's all over. lol

What?  It's fun for me, okay? :)

I mean, this month just flew by so fast, and yes, this is all my way of working up to my admission that I failed NaNo once again.  *sigh* I really didn't have any real ambitions of winning, but I was hoping to at least get past last year's mark.

'Tis not to be though.  In fact, I didn't even start on anything at all this month.

I have plenty of excuses, including an essay that was due earlier in the month and finally finished by the second week of November. I'm pretty proud of that one, by the way, so I can't feel too bad for working on it. But after that... well... let's just say I'm not much into writing these days. lol

"event","So.  I've signed up for NaNoWriMo again.  

What.  I couldn't resist, okay?? :)

Anyway, I am now in the process of figuring out what exactly it is I plan to write.  I mean, should I go with trying to finish up last year's novel? I only wrote 2,000+ words of it.  I can easily add 50,000 more to the story - well, not necessarily all at once, but with some pushing, I could possibly, maybe, get it done by December 1st.  *clears throat*

Or maybe I should write that time travel/western that is completely done in my head - and has been for several years now.  The problem with that one is that I've <i>read</i> that story already. lol I know how that one ends.  Still, it's a complete novel.  All I would have to do is write it.

Then again, I do have that <a href=""http://sheryls-pen.livejournal.com/16476.html"">other time travel story</a> I've started and could very well finish because I actually have at least half of that one done in my mind already.  I have a general idea of how it will end, but from experience, I know that things don't always go as I plan, so it could be a whole new ending - sort of...

And then there's the cultural study novel that has a really great plot, a fantastic subplot, and very interesting characters, not to mention that I really like this story.  You know. The one that I tried to write a couple years ago for NaNo, but found it to be extremely hard because I couldn't <i>relate</i> to one of the characters?  Yeah.  That one.

You know.  Maybe I could just try writing it again, and see if it will work out this time.

Oh, and I can't forget the fanfic novel that I've been dying to write. It's all ready to go and I can't wait to get to it. But this would be my sixth novel in that genre, and I'm thinking that I really need to write something that I could maybe get published and sell, so I'm really leaning toward writing original fiction for my NaNo novel this year.  This one may have to wait.

Last, but not least, and very <b>new</b> this year!  I have a supernatural story that's plaguing my thoughts lately.  Ghosts and scary stuff... well, I don't know if you would really consider it scary... But hey, I love the concept and plot that I'm coming up with.  This could be a fun story to write.  And as a bonus, I even have the playlist of music all set up. (I <b>can't</b> write unless I have music playing in my headphones.)  So yeah.  Maybe I'll do this one. :D

*sigh* I suppose all this is a moot point, as I will probably fail at NaNo yet again, but I have to at least try.  Besides, I am desperately behind on my <a href=""http://sheryls-pen.livejournal.com/35501.html"">2009 Writing Challenge</a> word count. The 50,000 words for NaNoWriMo will give me the opportunity to save face on that one.

Still, I'm pretty sure I will attempt it again this year.  If for nothing else than to say I am consistent, and to maybe get a little farther on that novel I started last year. :)  I'm thinking that I may end up with at least 3,000 more words on that thing before this year is over with.

Because of the rain, I spent a good portion of the time in my car, and since I was there, I just happened to have some quilt blocks to work on. :D  So yeah, I was able to complete yet another block in my ever growing list of quilt blocks for my SBS quilt.

That quilt is coming right along, but I do want to get some work done on the BOM Sampler and my Autumn Stars quilt.  It's just that those little blocks are so addicting!  I love making those things.

The group started a few weeks ago, so I am already behind.  Of course, I would have been behind anyway due to the fact that I hand piece all my quilts.  Still, I've already cut out the fabric for four blocks, so I'm getting a good start on it.

Four blocks out of 140...  Yeah. It's a start. :)

So now I am officially working on two yearly challenges.  The 200,000 words in 2009 challenge is not going so well right now. In fact, I haven't written one word since sometime in May.  Here it is almost July!!  The stories are there in my head, I just can't seem to translate those words onto my computer screen. I even tried to write something with pen and paper, which is definitely my last choice in writing anything, but so worth a try.  Nothing came from those endeavors, which I've come to terms with.  I've decided to take a break from even thinking about writing anything in hopes that my muse will get restless soon enough.

I really do think it's working too!

Two challenges designed to keep me busy doing what I love.  It will be interesting to see how I do with both."

Take my quilting, for instance.  I spent most of the day on Sunday organizing my projects and cutting out fabric for quite a few of said projects.  I still have a lot more fabric to cut out, and I am anxious to get to it again. :)  I'm thinking this weekend, if the wind blows right for me.

I've also been sewing a lot lately. I enjoy piecing my quilts by hand, mainly because it is so relaxing to me.  Sort of like a knitter, I suppose. And it is the perfect project to take with me to the park.  The kids have a blast and I am happily sewing along... It's a great day for all.

Also, I'm getting excited for our yearly camping trip.  The weird thing about this is that there are times when I can't wait, and other times when it's just ""meh!!""

I even check my friends page more than occasionally to see if there is anything good going on.  I just never take the time to think of stuff to put into my blog posts.

Still, I am back and I have been busy throughout the last couple of months.  I finished a couple short stories (yay!) and did a lot of work on the quilt I am making... oh and went through another bout of that nasty old condition called writer's block. Dang, that stuff is wicked. :)  I want to write, but not able to because of stress, or brain dump, or even just because of a certain stubborn, mean-hearted muse. 

Okay, so the stubborn, mean-hearted muse is really me, but still, I tried to write, and nothing of value came out of it.  Not good, okay?

But I am determined to get back into writing all those great stories and novel ideas that I started out this year with.  And even though I am behind in my word count for the yearly challenge, I have faith that I will recoup and get things done.

With that said, I do have an original story that I am dying to write.  It's all right there in my head, I just need to type it out. It's about two little boys (brothers) who have a few hours off from school, much to the chagrin of the oldest one.

Who knows, maybe I'll get to write it soon.  If the writer's block ever lets up.

Getting ready to go on the big camping trip in July. That's always good news!  Of course, for awhile there, I was worried that I wouldn't get to go.  I had made a deal with N that was almost guaranteed to backfire on me.  I hope I don't regret not following through on my end of things.

I've been slacking in the writing department, which is usually par for the course, but still disheartening considering the fact that I am behind on my word counts for the 2009 challenge I signed up for. Not to worry though. I still have 8 months in which to get caught up. *nods hopefully* Surely I'll get a lot accomplished in 8 whole months.

*ahem* 

Anyway, I have been writing a lot during this month and this is absolutely the best news ever!  I am ecstatic over the fact that I have so far logged in 17,362 words during the month of January 2009. *pats self on back* I've finished one story and almost have another done, so look for at least one of them to show up in this journal soon.

The words are being generated by a challenge that I signed up for. Basically I have to write 200,000 words during 2009.  The words can be a part of any project so long as the project is fiction, non-fiction or poetry related.  Blog posts don't count, nor do emails, letters to family and all the other little odds and ends that don't relate to the publishing industry in any way, shape or form.  That's okay though.  I just happen to like fiction, thank you very much! :)

The best part of the challenge is the fact that I can write half of a story, then move on to a different one, go back to the story I started earlier, and move on to a snippet of a novel that came to me as I was going about my day-to-day lifestyle. This is good for me because it gives me freedom to work on whatever story my muse wants to work on.

You know, I never could figure out how some authors can only work on one project at a time.  Just the other day I spent some time working on one story, but stopped to switch to another when an idea popped up for it while I was working on the first one, then back again because dang it, I had promised myself I would get more of that story done that day. :) This works for me and my muse, which is why I am actually accomplishing something with this challenge versus NaNoWriMo.    I get a lot more accomplished when I write what I want to write.

Of course, this means things don't get done on a timely basis, but hey. I enjoy the process. That's all that counts.

It's not because I don't have anything to say, it's just that I don't think anyone else is interested in what I have to say.  I really do think I should update here more though, if for nothing else, than to keep track of various personal goals.

Goals, you ask?  Why yes, of course.  I figure it's time to set some goals - and the fact that it's the beginning of a new year has nothing whatsoever to do with it.

Well okay, so I do this every year, but hey, why break a tradition?  :D

So yeah, here's to keeping goals and to lots of writing! And updating this journal, of course. :)"

"event","Well, as predicted by me, I didn't win NaNoWriMo this year.  I did get in more words than last year, though, so that is something to cheer about, right?  

I got a good start on the novel, but I fizzled out after the first day.  One of the characters was turning into a crackpot, and that was not what I had originally wanted.  Nor did I want to continue in that vein, so I stopped working on it when I couldn't figure out a way to fix it immediately.  Then when I finally came up with the idea of scrapping what I wrote and start over, I mentally said, no way.  In essence, I sort of lapsed along the wayside and forgot about it.

All is not lost on that novel.  I will continue to work on it.  In fact, I signed up for a writing challenge in a LiveJournal community to hopefully get motivated enough to write a lot of words next year.  I also hope to follow up on the ""couple prompts a week"" resolution that I made a few months ago.  Maybe this will get me into a regimen of writing a few hours a day, every day, no matter what.

Yeah, I always seem to make the <b>big</b> statements, don't I?

There was something else that I was going to say, but I got distracted by a certain insistent, bossy person, who insisted I jump when she calls.  I won't mention any names, but then I really don't have to for family members. :D

"event","I have several projects that I want to work on, and I admit that it was hard to decide which one to take to NaNo this year.  But I think I'm going to try focusing on writing a suspense/thriller type novel... well, at least I <strong>hope</strong> I can write a suspense/thriller type novel.  

It's the one my daughter wanted me to write and I have the first part of this novel already played out in my head. I figure the rest will come along as I write it (this is usually the way things happen for me).  I'm hoping that I will want to keep writing so that I can find out ""what happens next"", as well as who actually done it.  I have the profile of the killer already laid out - I just need to figure out exactly how to place the character into the story so that we don't get to the end and *poof*, here's the killer! 

And I'll figure something out.  The best part of writing a novel is coming up with scenarios to fix the plot holes. 

I am also thinking about working on another novel when things run dry for this one during NaNo, with the main focus being on the suspense/thriller novel so that I will have it completed by November 30th.  I have found that I get bored with working on the same thing every single day, and working on multiple projects at a time motivates me - so I thought I would try this and see if it will help me win.

Of course, what I really want is to focus entirely on the suspense/thriller, so maybe I can keep it going just for that.

Does anyone know if this is a NaNo NoNo?  I will go the traditional route if it is, and find other ways to keep me motivated.  I just want to be able to keep writing, and I figure I could at least try it.  Who knows, maybe I could write two novels this time.

Okay, so I'm pushing it.  I'm not so sure I believe those people who say they've written two novels during NaNo. That's a lot of time and effort. Too much, if you ask me.

So wish me luck!  I'm going to need all I can get!!"

"event","Autumn is the best time of year for me.  The trees are turning into a bright, colorful riot of leaves, and the air is getting crisp.  The perfect time to be outside, especially with the threat of winter looming over our heads.

Now all this may seem sorta poetic, but it's really just me trying to stall around the more important topic.

Writing.

Now see, it's like this... :)  

I haven't spent too much time on my writing, and while this can be a terrible thing for me (what happened to all that ambition and outlines?), I'm still not overly upset.  In fact, I am actually going to try something different.  I'm going to try the 'Character Interview' that I've seen others do.  I'm hoping that I will get a better handle on the one character who has intimidated me so badly that I can't ""write"" her.  Plus, I think it will also help me work out plot holes.

I tell ya, anything is worth a try at this point.  November 1st is just around the corner and I need to be ready to type out those 50,000 words in one month's time. 

Oh, and in other news, I found this book that was filled with prompts, one for each day of the year.  And I thought to myself, ""Wouldn't it be nice if I could write a little something using the prompts from that book... say, a prompt or two a week... and put the results into this journal? Yeah.  I think it would be great idea!""  So, with three months until January 1st, I'm making it an early New Year's resolution.  One or two prompts a week, with an ambitious goal of one a day.  Okay, so I got a little carried away with the last part. :) A couple prompts a week would be good.

It would be even nicer if I had someone to push me into working on that goal.

Life has been really drab for me lately, mainly because I am tired all the time. But I am working on getting past all that, which is a good thing.  It's about time I get back to working on the things I want to work on.

<u>Fiction</u>
NaNoWriMo is right around the corner, and I really do need to narrow down my choices here. Id manage to drop one of the stories I was considering, but then I remembered the anthology of short stories I've been wanting to write, and well... I'm back up to four again. :)  I suppose I will eventually figure out which one is the best choice, but more than likely it will be a last minute, have-to-decide-right-at-that-moment decision.  No matter. The best news is that I have something to write. 

<u>Writing</u>
Outlines are the evil monsters in writing. lol  Actually, they are supposed to help when writing a novel, but I am trying to outline with the intention of choosing which novel to write for NaNo and nothing is working out.  I get maybe the first chapter set up, then nothing.  I've never done this outlining before, preferring to fly by the seat of my pants with my prior novels, but due to my absolute failure at NaNo last year, I thought I might be able to focus on this year's attempt if I outline before hand.  

And let's not even go into character profiles.  I have a mental picture of my characters, but to actually sit down and write down their likes and dislikes; their parents, grandparents, siblings, childhood fantasies, and other history; as well as their personality traits and hang-ups... Holy crap! That stuff usually evolves as I write the story.  How can I know what they ate for breakfast when they were a kid?  Okay, so this is a little extreme, but all this trying to fill out the profile stuff is too intimidating for me.  I think I will work out the outline first (or at least try), then fill in the blanks of the character profile as I write the novel.  

<u>Personal Stuff</u>
Well, as personal as I will ever get in a public post. :D

This weekend is for writing and working on outlines.  Yep.  As soon as I get through all my errands, and the visiting, and the shopping, and the... Whew!  Maybe I'll actually get some time to work on the writing Sunday.

I have to find my priorities somewhere!!"

I'm going to try organizing ahead of time to see if that helps motivate me.

"event","I am writing again.  Yay!!  You would think that this is good news for me, but the stuff I'm working on isn't really what I want to work on.  It's all been one-shots, or short one scene stories, and I would much rather work on complex plots and characters.  Still, I am writing, so I can't do too much complaining.

I've also come up with a solution to one of my original novels - or at least I hope it's a doable solution. :D  I was having the hardest time trying to write this one character because I couldn't even begin to relate to the character's cultural beliefs. This is the one I wanted to write for last year's NaNoWriMo, and failed miserably at it.

Anyway, the other day it occurred to me that maybe I was going about it the wrong way.  The story was being told in the POV of the character I could relate to.  I got to thinking that maybe I should switch gears and tell the story in the POV of the person who was giving me so much trouble. When I write, I usually try to become the character, sort of like what an actor would do, and by doing so, the character would naturally be easier to write.  Bear in mind, this is in theory only, but hey, I'm willing to try anything.

Jeez, I know that the above made no sense to you all, but based on my past experiences with writing, it makes perfect sense to me. It just might work, and now I'm anxious to give it a try!

I've been getting out every Saturday, taking the kids and running around to just enjoy the weather.  We usually end up at a park, where I sit in the car and write, sew or whatever while the kids wear themselves out playing.  The one park that the kids seem to like above all else is one in Fenton, so we go there a lot.

Once the kids are properly wore out, or when they are ready to go, we head out on a long drive. (My favorite part!!) :D  I also feed them while we are out, so that makes things bearable for them.  They actually want to go with me on these Saturday excursions, so I don't feel so bad dragging them all over the State of Michigan. 

The weather has just been fantastic!!  I can't believe how great it feels to be outside in this stuff. :)  Sunny days, mixed with wind and brand new leaves and blossoms have totally enchanted me.  I don't ever want this to go away.

<ul>
Spend more time on original novels and short stories this year
Write at least half of a novel by the end of the year
Spend time plotting and planning all novel ideas
Write at least two short stories for publication
Take some writing classes and workshops to help me improve on my writing skills</ul>

"event","I have some thoughts on literary fiction, and the hows and wherefors of this form of writing, but because there is a reference to my beliefs in Christianity, I put it behind a cut to protect those of you who may have an adverse reaction to anything of that nature. :)  It's only a tiny reference, nothing to try to convert anybody, but I know how people can get. *shakes head* Besides, it is kind of long, and common courtesy demands that I put it behind a cut.

<lj-cut text=""My somewhat poetic thoughts with a teeny touch of Christianity mixed in"">
Once upon a time, I took an Introduction to Lit class that focused on fiction. Despite my aversion to Lit classes in general, I really enjoyed myself, as well as learned a lot about the world of fiction.  One of the first things we learned was the use of foreshadowing in fiction, and how most authors use this technique to add symbolism so that they categorize the story as literary fiction.

Now I used to be impressed with the term, ""Literary Fiction"", until I found out that this type of storytelling is just another genre. Some people tend to put literary fiction above other genres, like murder mysteries, detective stories, romances, and historical fiction, but for the life of me, I can't see the difference.  Every story ever told is a work of art, whether it be a children's story, a horror story, or even a *gasp* science fiction novel. They have the same elements in the story, including sybolism, foreshadowing, and metaphors (hopefully not a whole lot of metaphors). :)

But I digress a little.  Anything to get me off on a tangent, I guess. :D Anyway, what I was really going to write about is how the stories that we studied in that class used symbolic events to set the stage for their tales of woe.  A couple of them started out in late afternoon, which is supposed to foreshadow doom and gloom for the main character.  And it makes sense, in a way, because of the ""dying daylight"" and ""gloomy shadows"" and all that. But for me, late afternoon is my absolute favorite time of the day.  I love the fading sunlight, and how it paints everything with a golden hue that lights up the houses, trees and fields on the eastern side of the road. I love the smell of the oncoming night, especially in the Fall, when cold air moves in and a day's worth of raked leaves are burned throughout various neighborhoods.

There is nothing ""gloomy"" or ""sad"" about the late afternoon for me. It's a time for finding my inner peace and praising the Lord for such a glorious sight.  Even with dark gray clouds hanging low in the sky, I still love the atmosphere created by the end of the day.  So much so that I try to incorporate the sights and sounds into almost all my fics.  Not because I want to foreshadow a horrible event coming up in the story, I just want to share the happiness I feel every time I am out and about at that time of day. I get the same feeling whenever I visit the Rocky Mountains (I love that area!!). Unfortunately, I don't often get the chance to describe the mountains in my stories, but when I do...  *grins*  Great stuff, okay?? 

Still, I wonder what my Lit professor would say to my use of afternoon scenarios in the literary fiction stories I write.  ""The Tree"" and ""Surviving the Times"" both took place in the late afternoon, and both had a happy, hopeful ending.  Hmmm, maybe since there was a lot of anguish during the story, the symbolic use of gloom and doom would fit somehow...

Of course, the guy will probably never see it anyway, so it's sort of a moot point right now. :D

And yes, I am procrastinating on NaNo. I haven't written a word of the story for two days now. At least I am writing something, right?

Okay, so not <b>ALL</b> of LJ, just the writing communities. Let me have my moment here, okay??  Jeez! :D Anyway, I'm not sure if I will succeed, but at least I will come out of it with a good portion of a novel written.  I am determined!!

So, I woke up early, opened the curtains next to my computer so that I have a gorgeous fall morning to look out at when I run dry, words-wise, and sat down here to write.  What's the first thing I did?  I check out LJ to see what I missed? lol  Sometimes I worry about myself. :|

So anyway, I have a plot, a plan and one month in which to write at least 50,000 words. I really do want to win, even if the prize is only a banner I can put up in my journal.  There is this thing called pride, after all.  I want to be able to say that I actually got an original novel finished (and be one of those people who can honestly say they've won NaNo). :D  I think it would be great.

Of course, I hope to have come up with something really witty by the end of the month, if I lose.  Something along the lines of, ""I really didn't want to win anyway..."" or what have you.  Hopefully it won't come to that.

"event","It's getting closer to Nov. 1 and I am starting to really worry.  I am worried that I won't be able to write a word of a story, and that I signed up for <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org"">NaNoWriMo</a> for nothing. 

The problem is writer's block brought on by thoughts of my own inadequacies.  Basically, I can't sit down and write anything because psychologically, I don't want to.  How weird is that?

My muse is waiting to get going, and in fact, is already tempting me with bits and pieces of various stories, including the one I want to write for NaNo.  It's just that everytime I sit down to write, I come up with all kinds of reasons not to.  I want to, but don't want to.  *sigh*  Sometimes, I wonder why I even bother.

So, now I have to try everything I can think of to get past this stuff.  I'm hoping that starting with a blank page will be one of the things that will get me into gear.  Plan A is in place, all I need is to get the motivation to follow through on it."

"event","Well, the old laptop died.  Not completely dead, but the monitor won't work, so it might as well be dead.  The computer is working, I can hear the Windows theme start up, and if I turn the monitor so that sunlight hits it, I can barely see the wallpaper, but barely doesn't really cut it when I need to get some things done.

I did try to hook it up to another monitor, and was ecstatic at first when the computer logo showed up nice and clear, then sat back confidently when the Windows logo showed up, only to be let down in a big way when the monitor shut off on it's own when that screen changed over to the log in screen.  So unfair!!

So now I have to figure out what the heck is wrong with it.  And with my luck, it's gonna cost me an arm and a leg because don't you know, I don't have the money to fix it.  *grumbles*  I'm using Sara's computer now, which works out for us both, but I would much rather have my laptop so that I can take it with me when the urge to get out of this place for awhile hits me.

As for NaNoWriMo, I've been working on an idea during the last week, and have decided to work on the one that might be publishable.  It's a story of two women who are struggling to come to terms with their lives, while dealing with specific problems that keep getting in the way.

Oh man, that has to be the <b>worst</b> summary I have ever written!!  But you get the general idea (I hope).  Besides, I don't want to give the plot away too soon, especially since it will probably change as I write the dang thing.  It's just comforting to know that I will be going into this thing with a Plan A.  Plan B and C will be put into play before the month is over (it always does), but at least I know what I want to write.

Now all I have to do is to do some research and reading, because I want to make sure my characters seem realistic.  I'm not going to go with an outline, mainly because with this story, I don't know what's going to happen until it happens.  I don't have the full story in my head yet, like I do with the other one, so outlining may not work in this instance.  I'll just do the research and see what comes out of it.

Of course, this will all depend on whether or not this computer holds up.  Honestly, I am starting to think that maybe I shouldn't be involved in this event after all!"

"event","I am slowly, but surely working on getting caught up on the blocks for <lj user=""blockofthemonth"">.  I have three done so far, with a goal to get the other three done by November 1 (maybe only two, depending on whether to make the Balkan Puzzle one or not).  I really would like to have those blocks finished so that I can concentrate solely on NaNoWriMo when November rolls around.  I've been working on novel scenarios as I sew, and I'm hoping to have a firm idea when I finally start writing.

Well, I can't spend all my time writing in November.  I still need to do some major job hunting, as well.  But between writing, quilting and job hunting, I should be able to keep fairly busy.  Busy enough to want to stay home so that I can save money by not using the gas in my car.  I have to do something because the unemployment checks aren't nearly enough to keep me happy.

Now, if I could only find some place where I could do all of the above in solitude, I would be one happy critter!! :)

"event","Well, it's official.  I signed up to participate in this event last night.  I have absolutely no idea if I will be able to meet the 50,000 word goal, but I'm going to give it a good try.

In the meantime, I have to decide which novel to work on.  I could write the one that I can't put in a definite genre. I already know the whole story, all I need to do is write it.  But I'm thinking that there may not be a big interest in this one, and I would really like to write one that I could get published somewhere.

Then there is the one that I am working on right now (in my mind, anyway).  I'm pretty sure there is an audience out there for this one, and it would be interesting to find out the ending on this one.  The problem is that I don't have a specific ending and would absolutely hate to run dry somewhere around the middle of the month.  Still, I've written other novels where I didn't know what was going to happen next, and the wanting to know has pushed me to continue writing.  That's the fun part of writing a story.  I love it when that happens! :)

I also have a couple of mystery novels that I want to write, in fact Sara gave me a plot to use, and oh man! That one would be so cool!! Ahem... Anyway, I think what I will probably do is try to write the second one for publication, and if I stall, then start writing the first one to count toward the goal.  Just write everything in one document, even if I go back and forth, then separate them later.  At least I will be working on my novels.

So starting November 1st. *frets a little*  I'll try to keep you all informed on my progress."

"event","I've been in a major funk lately, but I am finally stepping out from under the gloom and thinking about getting things going again.  It's about time, I'm thinking.

Anyway, the Oriental Star quilt top is almost finished.  Mom did the majority of it, so I can't even truly claim it as mine anymore, but since I did ""design"" it, and pieced quite a bit of it, I'm still claiming it as mine <small>until mom sets me straight, of course</small>.  :) Now all we have to do is figure out the borders, sew that on and quilt it.  That's the good news.  The bad news is the problems we encountered on the way.  Jeez, talk about a pain in the neck.

The block itself really is easy to piece, once the logistics are figured out.  But as I mentioned earlier, my mother likes to think up ways to do things easier, which casued us a major headache when it came time to finish the blocks.  We ended up ripping out all the stitches in two of the blocks and redoing them from scratch.  She was able to salvage two more, although I sometimes wonder...  Still, we have all the blocks done and in the process of being pieced into a quilt top.

I am not an entirely perfect person myself, so it should be mentioned that I screwed up on some things, as well. I've been doing all the trimming of the seam allowances, and so far, I've accidentally cut into two strips of a block, and cut way too close to the seam in another, meaning we had to replace those strips to keep the quilt from falling apart.  Very frustrating.  Then I got confused on the placement of the blocks, trying to figure it out while telling my mother to shut up every five minutes so that I could figure it out. lol  She kept trying to help me out, but I couldn't concentrate. :)

I still have some more trimming to do, but I have learned to go slow, and take it easy.  And most importantly, I've learned to trim as I go, which means ignoring my mother when she says to not do it until after it's all done. 

Lord have mercy.  I've learned a lot about quilting and how to avoid mistakes, and one of the most valuable lessons that I've learned is to never make a quilt with my mother again!!!  *grins*  Let her make her own quilts."

"event","Well, as you all may, or may not know, I've joined the ranks of the unemployed. I was laid off due to lack of work. Apparently, I need to move to the Philippines or India in order to work for the First American Title Company. THey should probably change their company name to First International Title Company because they outsource almost all the work to foreign workers, leaving nothing for the Americans to do. Jeez!!

Anyway, I think I will take this forced vacation and write at least one of the novels I have floating around in my mind.  Raise your hand if you've heard me say that before. *grins*  I'm going to do it this time, I swear!!

Still, this would be the perfect opportunity, and I do have several ideas.  I also want to finish a short story that I started some time ago, as well as get some other writing stuff done. I can keep busy.  I just need to get my groove on.

So with that said, I'm going to make some goals.  My first goal is to at least start writing a novel.  And since at least two of the novel ideas require some research, that will be my first step.  Research and write.  I can do that.

Plus, <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org/"">NaNoWriMo</a> is coming up, and I'm thinking of participating this year.  Writing 50,000 words in one month's time sounds a little daunting, but I remember one weekend when I wrote well over 17,000 words.  And since I'm not working...  

Oh man, it still sounds daunting. :)  I will definitely need to have a full plot going if I decide to enter that thing.

Okay, so research, prepare and write.  I can do this.  I can.  Maybe...?"

"event","The Oriental Star Quilt is coming along very well.  We got a total of 8 blocks finished, and Mom plans to have two more totally finished by tomorrow, so that means half the quilt is done!  Unfortunately, we've found that 4 of the unfinished blocks may need to be dismantled and put together again because way back when we first started this quilt, Mom got the bright idea to try finding a better way to piece the inner star of the block. She found one, but we are now finding out that the pieces won't fit together nice and neatly, not to mention the points of the star don't show up clearly...

Needless to say, we found out that it is very important to follow the directions given with the pattern.  And I am trying very hard not to say ""I told you so"", or something else along those lines because it wouldn't be nice. It's hard, but I'm being a good girl.

Okay, so I did mention it a couple of times... :D

Anyway, after spending an entire day today piecing, I didn't get a whole lot of other things done.  Strange as this may sound, coming from me anyway, it's not that big of a deal.  I actually accomplished something, and if you don't know by now, I really do love making quilts, so the time was very well spent.  I even got an idea for a new book I'd like to write while I was sewing.  Multi-tasking, don't you know. 

So now, first thing I'm going to do is update my fiction WIP (work-in-progress) journal with the new book idea, then hopefully get in a few minutes of writing so that my day will be complete."

The Oriental Star quilt is coming along.  Mom is doing the majority of the work, and I feel bad because I can't keep up with her.  She has the time to sew, while I can only do it during my lunch hours and in between the times I sit here trying to write something on this FREAKING computer. Ahem, anyway, the blocks are coming along nicely and I think that once I post this entry and write one for my other journal, I'm going to settle down and work on a few blocks myself.

We've decided on adding a dark green border around the star in the center of the block, then alternate between the cream and green stripes to finish out the block.  I think it's going to look great, but then again, I do have some reservations.  I just want to get four of them done so that I can get a better idea of what it will really look like.  I'll try to remember to borrow Sara's camera so that I can get some pictures.

I just wish I could get back into working on some fiction.  I really miss it. *pouts*"

<lj-cut text=""The prompt"">
<blockquote>The prompt was to write about ""a fantasy figure - Dracula, Santa Claus, The Lady of the Lake, whatever... make one up if you wish - and make that character real in two paragraphs. Do that by including the kinds of details that makes us feel someone's humanity (or lack thereof). Convince us of his reality by using the mundane details of his daily life: holes in the sock, old war wounds, the whistle his mother gave him. I don't want a story, really... just a character sketch. BUT, I need to believe in this figure after I'm done reading.""</blockquote>

<b>A Legacy of Time</b>

He hadn't always been like this. He could remember a time when he looked forward to playing with his children and working the fields alongside his neighbors. His life had been full of worries, but at least he could walk freely among the townsfolk and laugh with his friends. All that was lost to him now. Now he was reduced to hiding out in the woods, avoiding the fearful and pitying looks from a few of the people he knew, and downright hatred from the rest. Anger and shame roiled through him as he thought about his plight, hating the monster who had doomed him to the life he now led.

He looked down at the watch in his hand, the only physical reminder he owned of his previous life and wished that things were different, that he could go back to the life he used to enjoy. But he knew that it was no use to wish for something he could never have, so he tried to push away the regrets as he knelt down next to the little hole he had dug in the earth. He buried the watch, knowing that it would be safe until he could come back for it the next day. It was the only reminder he had and keeping it safe was more important to him than surviving the effects of the full moon, and the curse he acquired when he was bitten by a werewolf. His job done, he looked up to see that it was almost time for his full transformation. He waited quietly, hoping that this time he'd be able to avoid the change, knowing deep down he could not escape his destiny. The moon shone clearly a few moments later and his last coherent thought filtered through his mind. He hadn't always been like this."

"event","Okay, I've found the quilt blocks for the Oriental Star and I do indeed have 20 of them waiting to be finished.  I'm not going to finish them the way that the pattern called for, though.  While I like the the final design of that pattern, I was thinking of doing something different.  I did an internt search to see what others have done with this block, and I think I may have come up with a solution.  I'm going to put a dark border around the star portion that I have already done, then finish the block with the light yellow fabric that made up the background of the star.  I'll decide what to do with the quilt top after I get the blocks finished - which will probably be a long time from now.  Hand piecing takes forever!!

I had to go through my stash of fabrics, and I think I've found the perfect fabric for the block of the month quilt I was hoping to get started on.  Rust, brown and cream colored fabrics would make a great quilt.  I know, because those were the colors I used in my first quilt. :D  So I think this weekend is going to be set aside for washing, ironing and cutting out quilt pieces so that I can sew whenever I get a few minutes.

As long as I get my story revision done first, of course.  That thing is due on Monday."

"event","Okay, so I thought I would post some examples of what I've done in the past as far as quilt making. 

The first one is a picture of a block that is going to be part of a quilt.  I just need to finish the blocks, then piece the top.  Still a lot more work to do on it.  

<lj-cut text=""Oriental Star"">
This is the ""guts"" of an Oriental Star block.  I still need to add on the outer pieces to make it into square. I think I have about 20 blocks made, but it's been so long since I've worked on it, I can't be sure.  Anyway, it won't matter if I can't find the blocks that I've made so far.  :)

I have a picture of a completed quilt, but the picture is kind of grainy.  I think that the spots were from a dirty lens. I'll replace this one if I can get a better picture of the quilt.

"event","Signs of depression are showing up.  I can feel it try to drag me down, and for the most part, it's doing a great job. But I really do need to fight it, because I still have a ton of things that need to be done.

So, instead of focusing on the negative things that are filling my head, I am going to focus on the things I am looking forward to.  The end of my class, for instance.  That class has taken a lot out of me, and I will be so glad when I no longer have to worry about getting anything done. My favorite daydream about that class is thumbing my nose at the course web page and saying, ""Good riddance."" *grins*  Very childish, I know, but helps to reduce the stress a little, so I'll indulge every once in awhile.

I went through my stash of fabrics today and was amazed at what I found.  It's been a long time since I've gone through that stash, and I didn't realize how much fabric I had collected over the years.  I went ahead and started sorting through the various pieces to put them into groups by color, and I noticed that my tastes run more toward the brown, green and red spectrum of the color scale.  I do have some purple, yellow and orange fabrics, as well as lots of peach (which I lumped in with the reds), but I was surprised to find that I had only a smattering of blue.  Apparently, blue is not on my favorites list. :)  Anyway, as I mentioned earlier, I've been thinking of making a quilt, and I thought that I might try making one through the <lj user=""blockofthemonth"">.  I was thinking of doing both versions that are offered this year, making one them in various shades of green and tan, and the other one with scraps of bright colored fabrics.  The only thing is, I'm not great at making commitments on this stuff, so please don't hold me to it, okay??  :D

Still, I'm a little excited about getting into it again.  I will have to make adjustments to the patterns because they are for machine piecing (which I don't know how to do), but I'm up to the challenge of converting the pieces so that I can sew them by hand.  Usually, what I do is cut out the pieces, get the majority of them pinned together, then sew the pieces together whenever I find a few minutes to work on them.  This is why I love hand piecing, I can work on a block virtually anywhere.

I also went on a scavanger hunt to look for some of the UFOs (unfinished projects) from the past, but so far I haven't found anything.  I still have one more place to look, so all is not lost yet.  In the meantime, I'm going to be washing material to get it ready for when I can find the time to cut out the pieces.

You know what?  Even though I am still stressing a little over my homework and that freaking class, I do feel better now that I'm thinking about working on a new quilt.  Just thinking about it is soothing my soul.  :D"

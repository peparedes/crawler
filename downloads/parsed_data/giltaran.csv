Haven't been following this place as much as I should since my blog server died.  I should have the blog back up and syndicating again before too long, but in the meantime if any of y'all want to be in touch, I'm socially networked on Ravelry, IM, Twitter, and Skype - all using the giltaran user name.  No, no facebook - at least not yet, and definitely no myspace, not ever.  

See ya here, there, and everywhere!"

Moved.
Allll-right, that's finally the end of it. All previous entries in this blog are now resident in the new site. As a reminder, the new blog syndicates to LJ. To continue receiving my fevered ramblings, add the new blog to your friends list.

You can do that here.

Or through here: http://syndicated.livejournal.com/giltaran_blog/profile

Best practice will be to click on the link associated with an entry to comment, as I haven't figured out how to get livejournal comments to come back yet - but will probably still see them eventually all the same.</i>

Ya know, it's been three and a half months now since I moved my blog, and only one other person besides myself on my friends list has subscribed to it, and that person I had to prompt.  

I guess that tells me how much my thoughts were worth, eh? Thanks for putting up with me while I was posting, I guess, and I'm sorry to have wasted your time.  

-Gil"

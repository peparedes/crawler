"event","I hold on with hope because hope is the only thing that has ever made life livable. Stargazing, wishing well, candle-blowing, four leaf clover brand hope. It springs up from unexpected actions and overanalyzed words, takes root in the midst of senseless thoughts and thoughtless ideas, and is ignored entirely by parts that know it will not help their cause. But it is there, and demands attention as much as lungs demand air. 

This is a precarious balance, threatening to capsize over a small, gold-wrought artifact. The balance is not well defined, however, sides are not clearly marked and information is sorted in a process riddled with defects. There are no clear marked bounds, and what may one moment serve to help may the next attempt to destroy. Logic holds no sway when everything is bathed in grey; logic is too black and white. 

I am hard pressed to describe what to call it now, for it is neither black nor white in this case. Facts are looked upon through a filter that renders them in no recognizable shade at all. It is a non-color such as white could never hope to achieve and a blending of colors that black could only dream of - but it is not grey either. Grey simply comes the closest to describing it. 

That so little seems to have changed on the surface rather throws me off, the pond appears still but I know that there are swirling, turbulent waters lurking just beneath. This is held testament in every dark night that I lay awake and count the lines on the ceiling, by every word that I choke on for lack of feeling the right to say. So much restrained, though I don't wish it to be. If I could, I would talk for days, if I had words they would spill out over pages upon pages. 

As it is, I am constantly throwing these letters away. They are senseless, gibberish, incoherent, and nothing at all that I was meaning to say. Like always the words are caught, they do not measure up to the expectations that I held for them. They are tossed into the pile of ever growing frustrations at attempting to express what simply will not take shape. 

Hope - and these wishes are stacked so high that I am surprised the overflow hasn't been more than is seen, though the cap of my inability to express has filtered out most of the truly important pieces. These hopes and wishes, they are reduced to simple words, inefficient stuttering. It seems I spend a great deal of my time currently casting about for simple words to express some of the more simple, yet powerful, things that I have no idea how to even being to say. 

Even in this, I am babbling. My words are not true to my meaning, there is more to this than I could ever hope to write down.. But that is of little consequence at the moment. What matters is that I made an attempt, and more so, what matters is that I somehow managed to put down more of this than I have been able to as of late. Meaningless blather, I'm sure, but it will suffice. 

Some days it feels like hope is the only thing that I have ever really known how to do, even, sometimes, when hope seems to be the thing furthest from my state of being at the time. It seems I cannot help but hold tightly to this string, for I know just how much is depending on it. 

This used to be my haven, my catharsis, my place to purge and control. 

It has been awhile. You still smell the same.

Well, I moved 2 hours away from where I lived before but still travel back 3 times a week due to clients that pay entirely too well to give up.

I married Gary :-) ..yes, it IS about time.

I got the Insatiables line up and running.

I apparently alienated a shitload of people who no longer bother to talk to me now that I'm married ..as if they had a fucking chance before, haha.

I made ammends with the ex that broke the fuck outta my heart, he's about to be married next week, congrats to him.

I made ammends with the other ex that I fucked over royally. 

I still lust terribly after an old LJ friend :-)

I survived all 4 hurricanes, despite evacuating 3 times in 7 weeks and sustaining serious roof damage to my brand new home. We're all safe and thats what counts.

hhmmm ...seems to be all of it.

32 looks to be shaping up to a good year.

"event","oh my shit ..these hurricanes are really sucking. I've just spent three days in a HOT highschool with no power, sleeping on a hard floor and existing on egg salad sandwichs, apple sauce and water ..which I'm damn thankful for but am totally sick of ..thanks Red Cross.

Our house has a lot of water damage because we live right on the beach and the surge brought in a few extra feet of water, plus some of our roof tiles were picked off. The carpet in my bedroom is ruined, theres damage to the walls and a whole wall of electrical sockets won't work. We had one fairly young oak tree uprooted and two limbs cracked on larger trees. While trying to chain saw one of the limbs down, its gotten lodged into the tree behind it ..so we have half a tree suck in another tree. We can't get it down, despite every effort and its too high to climb safely to cut, so we're going to get a boom truck in here tomorrow and see what we can do about it. 

Our gutters were knocked down during Charley and hadn't been replaced yet so all of my shubbery around the house has been beaten by the water pouring off the roof. My dock is underwater and seems to have some damage but I can't tell how bad right now. The roof of the tool shed in the back yard is smashed in, I can't even open the doors, not sure how I'm going to get in there. Half of my brand new fence has been lefted out of the ground ..I'd say about 4 to 6 panel (32 to 48 feet). Theres bits of tree and debris all over the place and I haven't even been around the neighborhood or town yet to see the rest.

My husband was recording in L.A. last week and couldn't get a flight in to be here so he didn't get here until today. 

Worse still ..it's STILL frickin raining here AND Hurricane Ivan is on the way. I don't think I can handle a third evacuation. This is just fucking insane.

Anyway, just stating that I'm alive ..which I guess is great news and we're very fortunate to be safe and to have power when 6 million other people still don't. I'm going to bed, lots of clean up to do over the next few days."

Mr. Fuckingknowitall couldn't fix the driver problem, he couldn't even name the adapter after 2 DAYS!, the best he could do was Standard Graphics PCI something something ..but after 20 minutes of reading a tutorial and locating the card, I named the adapter and device properly (thanks HKEY thingies!), located the correct drivers, installed them bitches and got that piece of shit in working order.

A video tape of Paris Hilton bumping uglies was leaked. Looks like Paris is a vain little thing, even while getting poked. Notice how her parents lash out at the person who leaked the tape out and didn't say anything about their daughter. Why is it that only skanky attention whores like Paris and Pamela Anderson ever get caught making amature porn?? It never is the ones you really wish would make a film. You know, the ones that you find yourself waking up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat dreaming about?? Like Paige Davis. 

I went on kazaa and tried to download this, but I was SHOCKED to discover there are some very unscrupulous people on kazaa who like to share files that aren't what they say they are. I have downloaded 7 ""paris hilton sex video"" files so far and all I have to show for it are: 

-monkey drinking his own peepee video
-howard stern wackpack 'wassup' parody
-paris hilton fluff piece promo thing (i learned vincent gallo wrote a song for her, which at least feeds my curiousity into the gallo infamy) 
-a so-so porno of some non-paris blonde 
-one file that wouldn't open but which i suspect will probably delete all the files on my harddrive 
-saddam and rumsfeld shaking hands video
-a megafattie dancing in a bikini video 

but you know, all in all, it was worth it for the monkey video. 

The RIAA and MPAA need to learn that the way to kill file-sharing is not to sue those people who share, but to flood the servers with so much mislabeled crap like this that no one bothers anymore. If I had to download 20 different 20mb files of ""Paris Hitlon sex video!!1 (REAL- No FAkE!),"" pulling down three donkey-fucking vids, two travelogues about Norway, and a half-dozen assorted little league games before I finally managed to satiate my ugly-skanky-heiress-buggery fetish, I'd probably just give up and wank it to... yep, Paige Davis. 

Yesterday I spent most of the day curled up on the futon while Gary was in the studio. Afterwards we went to our favorite little Italian place for a plate of the mussels. I didn't have much of an appetite. Then we decided to take in a film. We saw Radio, it was pretty good, not as good as I was hoping for tho. Somehow I always end up with the one person in the theatre who can't seem to close their mouth while eating popcorn right behind me. It is a gift.

"event","Hey everyone.  I'm living in Berkeley now.  It's wild.  I think I'm doing a decent job of living on my own, not eating too much junk, I do my laundry OK and clean up after myself most of the time.

My classes are looking to be really interesting and educational, but also very demanding.  What was I expecting?  Hopefully I'm just having first week difficulties, I'm sure I'll get better at managing all of it, but for now it seems pretty beastly.  I'll keep you all posted.

My classes are:  Intro to Comparative Politics, a college writing class focusing on Monsters in Modernity (film, literature, etc.), an upper div class on Language and Power (this class will kick my ass), a Philosophy seminar focusing on the Ethics of Morality (aka, When is it OK to kill someone?) and an upper div Political Science class where we sit for an hour a week listening to guest speakers (Ahnold was a speaker one year, so I'm stoked for this one).

Aside from school I've mostly been hanging with Hart kids, though I've met a ton of cool people up here.  I'm playing guitar some more, maybe I'll try to start writing songs again.  That actually sounds really refreshing, especially since I've been on one of the worst runs in my poker life.  The cards have just been shitting on me over and over again.  But that happens, it's called variance.  Losers go through this and think the whole world is out to get them and cry about it.  Winners (like yours truly) listen to Elliott Smith records and let the storm pass.  I'll be rolling around in my millions again in no time, just you wait.

This weekend is going to be action-packed.  Monica is coming up, my dad is coming up, Kris, Chrispy, TO, everyone is coming.  You should come too.

Hope everyone is doing well.  Leave comments if you'd like.

"event","Hey everyone.

I spent a week recently on a cruise through Alaska.  In all honesty, it was one of the most mentally cathartic weeks of my life.  It was like all the layers of bullshit crusted over suburban L.A. life had been lifted, and I was finally able to see what was underneath.  The mountains, the glaciers, the wildlife, all of it was beautiful.  I think I appreciated the simplicity the most, meeting people who fished for their food and carried their fresh water to their houses in big buckets.  It was just so nice to get away and clear the head.

Since I got back I've been sliding back into my usual routine, keeping the cards in the air as every degenerate gambler should.  Monica just got her wisdom teeth out so I've been chillin on couches with her eating Jell-o and other wonderfully soft foods.  She's a trooper, should be back at Olive Garden in no time.

I've also been busy preparing for school and moving up to Berkeley.  My schedule is sort of whack, I'm wait-listed for 2 classes.  I'm only 2nd on both lists, so I think I should be fine.  Nevertheless, it's pretty stressful to not know what's going to happen.  Fingers are crossed.

I move into the dorms on the 20th, so if anyone in the SCV wants to hang, hit me up soon.  If I answer the phone and say ""Hella"" instead of ""Hello,"" you know you're too late.

Hope all is well, peace easy."

"event","Well well well, it's been a few months since I wrote in this thing.

The main thought on my mind is that come Monday my best friend Daniel Gad will be shipped off to boot camp and on his way to becoming a Marine.  Daniel, I couldn't be more proud of you, you're the bravest and strongest person I know.  I know you'll be having the time of your life once you're out there, and I'll be here praying that you stay safe and happy.  I know that things have changed a lot between us over the years.  We've both made a lot of decisions that have caused our paths to diverge, but I'm glad we're still able to spend time together.  I can't tell you how sorry I am for any ways that I've wronged you or any times I've missed hanging out with you, and I know what is my fault and what couldn't be helped.  Anyway, take care of yourself out there, I love you like a brother and always will.  Peace my man.

I just got back from seeing Danny (Heat) and Richard (for Urchins) perform at Cal Arts, both were fantastic.  It was a great time.  I know I don't fit in too well with that crowd for obvious reasons, but they're all very accepting and geniune, it's a lot of fun.  Danny got me on stage and I played drums in a song, I haven't played drums in months.  For a couple minutes I felt like I was really able to be myself again.  It would sure be something to get another band together.  Playing music is and always will be what makes me truly happy.

However, since music has not been available, I've been spending (too?) much time playing cards, as most of you probably know.  Someday this quote will come from my blog instead of Daniel Negreanu's: ""The final tally was 9 hours for a $528,000 win in poker, plus another $56,000 in Chinese Poker. That put me over the million dollar mark this year in the big game after about 70 or so hours.""  My stats are not quite that impressive, but I'm keeping my head above water none the less.  I'm scheduled to play in a tourney on July 9th at Sycuan Casino in San Diego, if anyone would like to come out and watch me gun for $5,000, I'd love to see you on the rail.

Other than that, I've been spinning the new AFI disc pretty much non stop.  At first I didn't like it, there are a lot of electronica and pop aspects of the songs, but it's certainly growing on me.  You should probably pick up a copy and flip it to track #4.  

I leave for Berkeley on August 20th.  Until then, I hope I see you all many times.  Take care.

Let's start with school.  Since it's past midnight, it's officially March, which means in about 30 days I'll find out where I'm going to spend the next four years.  Should be a very interesting time.  I'm pretty split between Berkeley and LA, though SD doesn't sound too bad either.  I'm just going to see who wants me; those letters might narrow my decisions down quite a bit, who knows.  As for school now, Lit is Lit, and everything else is cake.  I'm working on better time management but mostly just keepin' it real and waiting out this last semester.

I got a job today at Math Support, so if anyone wants me to teach them math, just call em up.

I'm now also a hired writer at Gutshot.com.  They're going to be publishing articles I write on poker theory and stategy once or twice a month, so for anyone who's interested I'll let you know when they start posting my ramblings.

Speaking of poker, online poker has been very good to me lately.  I've been on a mad rush and I don't plan on stopping any time soon.  When I make my first million I'll throw a party for everyone on my Friends list.  Woowee.

My boo and I are still straight west coastin, although she's gonna be moving into her own place after this month and throwing tons of parties without me.  Her guest list is short and only includes Gabe, Thom Yorke, and then Gabe again.  Bummer.

The UTT album is fantastic, I couldn't be more proud of these guys.  You should all get a copy if you wanna hear me shredding guitar on Track 2, but you should get it anyway just because they put so much work into it and it came out so great.  Holla at the Southsider Riders and my boys in Dub C.

I'm gonna head off to bed, hope everyone is doing well, peace.

"event","I just finished watching a couple old Venus Diode show DVDs, and I realized there are some things I wanted to say.

The memories I have from having been in Venus Diode are the best I could ever ask for.  The 3 years I spent in that band were the best of my life; I would give anything to get back just one hour in a practice studio with those guys and those instruments.  There will never be a poker game or a work of literature or anything that compares to playing music in a band.  I don't know where I'm headed in the future, maybe I'll be a politician, or a lawyer, or a teacher, or a writer, or something, but my passion will always be in music.  And although we in Venus Diode had many struggles and conflicts, there is no band I would have rather spent my high school years in.

So to anyone who ever came to a show, or listened to one of our songs, or asked me, ""Hey are you the drummer for Venus Diode?"" I thank you for giving me an unforgettable high school garage band experience.

And to the handful of guys - Ravi, Chris, Eddie, Jeremy, Daniel, all of you guys - who came out to almost every show and screamed along to Fashion of Intercourse, you guys are some of my best friends.  I'm sorry if I ever acted like too much of a rockstar to appreciate what you guys were doing for me and the band.  Thank you.

And to my bandmates, you guys will always be more than family to me.  I know some of us aren't the closest, some of you I don't even see anymore, but you guys were and always will be my brothers, and if any of you ever want to spend a day hanging out or playing music or whatever, I'll be around.  I know I was always kinda quiet, so thanks for showing me the time of my life.

Twenty years from now I'll tell someone, ""You know, in high school, I never smoked weed or got drunk or partied, but for three years, I was a drummer in the best band that was ever formed.""

So thanks everyone.

"event","the cruise was alright.  there were some highlights but there were also a lot of boring times.  i think cruises are set up  more for adults than kids.  it was still pretty good though.

i spent today with friends having a good time and neglecting school stuff.  i may regret this decision.  i hate having so much to do for something i care so little about.

stress, especially from school, makes me  miserable.  i don't want school to start at all.  i should just tough it out like everyone else.  maybe everyone else doesn't care so much about something else they'd rather spend their time on.

it doesn't matter, i'm stuck in these classes.  i'm going to end up doing the work even if it makes me miserable because that's what i've always done and i don't know any better.

everyone keeps telling me that someday i'm going to be really happy that i did all this work.  i hope they're right.

it's probably not that much work and i'm just bitching.  yeah i'll go with that and shut up about it.

some of my buddies are leaving Hart, and i'm gonna miss them.

i found out that jeremy is gay tonight, and that's pretty cool.  good for him.

i don't really want to go to sleep, because then tomorrow will come, and that means a lot of work.

i don't know why i'm on this thing.  i read this back to myself and i sound like just another confused kid.

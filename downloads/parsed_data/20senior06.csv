"event","Eric Becker, one word, awesome! He was a brother to me. I cant express what this loss feels like, not as it did with my Father. But Eric was a caring man, watched out for everyone. He was good looking, personality everyone loved. I just wish He never got on that Motorcycle, I wish he never drank, I wish someone took his keys, and told him no. I love you Eric, like a brother, that I never had, I hope when I'm older I meet and marry a guy like you. You are one in a very small few.  <3  


R.I.P. Eric.1971-2005 and my Father. Mark 1958-2001

I thank God for letting me know you though only for 4 months. Work will never be the same with out you. Though this was terrible, you let Mark, Tony, Raul, and Miguel come closer to me. I can't thank you enough for the friendships you have created for me. Our Friendship will always be special to me!"

"event","Eric was a co-worker of mine, He was one of those all around good guys! Who cared about everything and anything. Hard worker, wanted to meet everyone, wanted to make sure your happy. Then something terrible happened, he went out and got killed, soo my heart is breaking, Its soo hard to lose someone like him I mean i know he was lik 13-14 years older than me, but idk he was a good friend, I dont believe that there should be ages on friendship. He was a great kid at heart, unbelieve man, I havent been this hurt since my Dad left this place we called Earth, My depression is back YAY for depression! I love you Eric! Always and Forever"

"event","Its weird, I tried sooooo hard to be noticed, by one person,everyone can say something to that, yet one that I never really talked to yet he was a sweet heart did, not in a love way, but noticed things you do, or the way you have changed, I was missing something, and I now know, nice guys finish last, but they wait and they get the best girls. I might not be the best girl. but I know hope I continue my search for the nice guy, rather than go for the ""bad"" guys. Lauren I think I understand now."

"event","i feel i should get back into livejournaling again. at least journaling/writing period. i'd probably want to start over tho, like hide entries before this. i tend to be a packrat at times, so i'd just hoard all of the old comments and entries and still start fresh.

or i'd just get a new account.

i want to start livejournaling again but natasha says it's like a dead art now. nobody does it. but i've gone through a few pages and it shows me that some people are still doing it, so that's awesome and sort of inspiring.

i'll figure this out soon. should go wrangle up the rest of my stuff so i'm ready to head back to Tucson tomorrow.
later, people who still skim past my livejournal."

"event","does anybody know what the current status of the Orphan Works Act of 2008 is right now?
i've been wanting to look into it further since i first heard of it during the beginning of spring semester and when it was brought up again towards the end of the semester for one of the editorial illustration options.
and i actually tried to look it up.  just now before posting.  which is why i'm posting now because i can't make heads or tails what's going on.
it says that it's gone to Legislation for Judiciary.  does anybody remember what that means?  it's been a while since i took that US Government in high school.
something tells me i'd fail the US citizenship test if i had to take it. :(

i'm also interested in looking into the Orphan Works Act some more because i'm iffy about posting any art stuff online.
but i guess that just makes me a wuss."

oh well, i guess...
bothered me earlier when it dawned on me a few hours after my show would have been (5:41 here?) but i guess it doesn't bother me too much now.
kind of annoying but...still slightly depressing.

hoping to do another show next fall with my friend Mike Kane, whom I'm sure most people from U of A who watch me  knows of.....or at least natasha and sean cuz of desk duties.

in other news:
it's been forever since i've seen any Anthony Bourdain action on Travel Channel.  man i miss watching him. : /

plus i have two finals this week, both on Thursday.

20th Century American Art History: 2pm - 4pm
Japanese 102: 8pm - 10pm

gotta worry bout my project.

maybe....
sorry Natasha. :(
maybe more camping/fishing this summer?
prolly cuz i'll be living with NATASHA AND JAY while we take the comics class again!!  not Jay tho.  cuz he'll be graduated by then.  plus he's in computers.  there's no comics in computers.

didn't go out with the bang i had wanted but i guess i hadn't put too much into it anyway.

burned out from the end of the year.
damn week before finals.  art projects. merrrrrr.
at least i don't have to write any more papers.  artist statements don't count.

but still.....projects like cannon ball hail stones on fire.  freezer burn.

hopefully i'll be doing the radio again next year.  i would like to finish out UofA doing it all four years but we'll see how the schedule goes.

to be honest...i've never played a Pokemon game before.  i think i watched my friend play PokeSnap (that Pokemon photography game for the N64?) in middle school and i've watched my brother play Pokemon Stadium for the Gamecube.  otherwise...i think i've cheated my childhood by never buying/playing those games.

anybody know where i can get emulators for those games, or just any good emulation sites in general?"

pretty good show.

didn't go to Minus The Bear.  surprise surprise.

managed to play that long Mars Volta song i wanted to play last week.
i really liked the Monster Movie track.  really want to check out the rest of the Graveface sampler it came off of.
loved Los Campesinos! too.  they were awesome.

was pleasantly surprised to see the Colin Meloy album.  I heard something about him writing the perfect indie album...don't remember who mentioned it on their lj or blog or whereever.  i guess this is what they were talking about?  was pretty good tho.  just live stuff.  not too much newwww...have to get that burned later.  procure it some how.

now i'm off to write mah paperrrr.  art history focusing on Andy Warhol's business ethic and how that applies to the art market boom in the '60s.  yep..all outlined...just 7 more pages to go + endnotes.  maybe an image or two to take space and give reason?  maybe.

PS  Jess, i still have your 30 Days of Night.  i haven't read it yet, but i probably will this/next weekend and can give it to you when you're at work cuz i dunno when else i'll see you.  hopefully we can hangout before the end of the semester??? maybe??? hopefully.

PPS i gave my speech at the Tucson Japanese Speech Contest last weekend.  was pretty fun.  nerve wracking till  i got on stage, then i was good.  had fun.  Angela recorded some video, so maybe i'll post that?  we'll see.

i guess on a side note about content...has anybody been looking into this Orphan Works Act?  i've read stuff here and there, but i finally took a closer look at it today in Illustration class when we had to get in groups to read an article and produce ideas for a possible accompanying illustration.

anybody try any of those Mint Crips M&Ms out yet?  the Indiana Jones ones?? they are pretty good, i must say.

plus, thinking about it, i mentioned last post that the Los Campesinos! album art reminded me of <lj user=""heroprotagonist"">'s work because they were rough drawings of funny looking people doing funny/fun things.  not too similar in art style, but possibly in intention?"

was a pretty good show today.
got antsy, or at least worried i was late for my show and didn't want the previous dj to set up the pre-programmed RoboDJ to play inbetween shows, so i ended up playing Blur a little early, so it may not even show up if you just stream the hour of my show (MONDAYS-4PM).

The Raconteurs have a new album!!  it caught me by suprise, and according to the review, it caught everyone else off guard, as well.  the album design/images look awesome and the track i played was pretty damn cool.  i'd really like to listen and see if it's better than the last one.
i liked their previous album but...it took me a few listen throughs to really like the whole thing, or at least tracks other than the singles.

Minus The Bear and Portugal. The Man are coming!!  i still don't know if i'm going to that or not!!

played Tokyo Police Club!!  good stuff.  LISTEN TO IT.

Los Campesinos! were really awesome too!!  didn't expect them to be so awesome.  their album art is really sweet, too.  kind of reminded me of stuff Phil might like?  at least it sort of reminded me of his stuff.

it was a pretty good show.
i felt like i had a lot more misses than hits with what i played.

like i thought the Less Than Jake cover would have been good...but i didn't like it.  i was interested in listening to The Spill Canvas because i never heard their stuff before, but the reviewer thought it was..ehh....and so did i.  wasn't that great.  and i was a little bit suprised to see a new Death Cab For Cutie single, but the reviewer said it was a bunch of schlock, too...which it kind of was.  he said that Death Cab had said they were going for a darker album this time, but it seemed only a teensy bit darker than Plans, which was kind of okay, too.  i like it but i liked their older stuff a helluva lot more.

still okay tho.  was happy to play Boom Boom Satellites and Dethklok and was a little suprised, pretty satisfied that Dt. was pretty good, too.
need to find magazines dealing with JRock and JPop and whatever.  not some lame nationally published otaku fanzine but something more serious, maybe from Japan but it caters to nonJapanese consumers. hm.

i like Elf Power a lot now.  i have only heard two songs, the ones played on my show, but i really like them.  sucks i'll miss their show, but it's a work night and i have a killer paper coming up for American Art History that i can't slack on cuz i want/need to see Minus the Bear/Portugal. The Man.
yeah.

PS. i saw Juno.  it was something else. i  liked it but i thought the dialogue was really meh, at least at the beginning and pretty much whenever Juno's friend opened her mouth.  but it was sort of cute.  the focus was on Juno but it could have used some more Michael Cera. maybe a few more watchings and i'll like it a bit more.
i only bring this up cuz..well, i saw it, plus i played a track from the soundtrack i really liked. the one from the opening credits? yeah, that one.

and i guess Michael Cera is going to be Scott Pilgrim in the liveaction film?  sounds decent.
i really need to play some Kupek and 100 Damned Guns next week, plus Dragonforce and....other stuff?
and catch up on Arrested Development. only seen a few episodes....
that's about all that's on my mind."

was a decent show.  i was lame tho and forgot to play Blur at the beginning of it.  oh well. kinda breaks the opening rhythm i had going but it was close enough, right?

i enjoyed pretty much all of the music i played today which is awesome and has been pretty rare the past month or so.

Minus the Bear/Portugal. The Man is coming. Apr. 24
i guess Elf Power is coming too? Apr. 22
and so is Thrice. Apr. 19

and Tawny, you need to go see Man Man when they stop in Glasgow.  they are AMAZING. one of the best live shows i've ever scene.  really fun and catchy.

i also got a request!  for The Whigs!  by someone who is a part of the radio station who was listening in.
not bad.  i do appreciate he was listening in and that i got a request.
but where's everybody else....?

it was differnt having my show back.  i don't know if i liked it like it was before or not, because i would usually sit in the back or say something and the others would fill in the on-air conversations.  today was just me going derr derr derr every time i came on.
maybe not so much the first time i spoke, but after The Mars Volta song when i came on to introduce Primus and mention the Les Claypool show that's tomorrow....i just started stumbling.  it sucked.  but i guess i saved myself a few times by transitioning enough so i could finally play the damn song.

wasn't able to download my show from last week.  not sure if it really matters...wasn't too terribly good, but just not being able to download it bothers me a bit. oh well.

Happy St. Patrick's Day, everyone.  especially you Pat.

don't get too drunk, everyone.
ah ahahah...hm.

i think i'm going to go watch Rudy now, or maybe just draw or nap, or draw myself napping..or something."

it was another interesting show.  i have another intern.  his name is Cameron.  he seems like a pretty cool dude.  he has tiny gauges in his lobes and is into hip hop, classic rock and everything else.  pretty sweet.
Chris still digs it, which is cool, too.
i let Chris take the helm on entering stuff into the computer for the playlists and whatever so he could get the experience.  Cameron is going to start out the next show doing that.  he said that he's been a part of his school radio at his former school, American University, except it was talk radio so this may be new stuff for him.
still cool tho.  good to get the experience.

I DID IT.  I PLAYED 100 DAMNED GUNS!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOfelt good.

it also felt good to listen to that Yeah Yeah Yeahs song again.  been a while since i heard, seeing as i don't own the EP it's on.

the ""Survivalism"" remix was surprisingly good.  check it out.  please.

made sure to start my show out with Blur.  it's going to be tradition now.
any suggestions for what Blur song i should play on the next show?

i do know that i played some Blur, Bloc Party, Nine Inch Nails, Nada Surf, NOFX (my intern wanted to play some), Neon Blonde, Gorillaz, Mahjongg, Minus The Bear...and...others. i can't remember them all. sorry.

yeah, i have an intern on my show now.  his name is Chris.  he's a pretty okay guy who says ""i can dig it"" a lot and seems to like punk stuff like Pennywise and Tsunami Bomb.

also, i dedicated that Neon Blond song, ""Dead Mellotron"" to you TK.  yes.  you.

remembered this cartoon and wanted to find it on youtube so i could listen to the intro but couldn't remember the exact name of it.  after some searching via google i found it.  i preceeded to pat myself on the back before i headed back to finish homework.

it's called Space Goofs.
i tried to watch it whenever it came on.  was a really good show, probably underrated and forgotten."

really liked The Faint remix for Nine Inch Nails.

really want to see that ""Control"" movie now.  the one about Joy Division.

want to see Les Claypool when he comes to town, too.

George Clinton came last Monday.  failed to mention that.  wish i could have gone to that, but i wasn't in too much of a funky mood since i was coming off a cold and wasn't feeling funky with all the work i had to finish up yet.

""A Well Respected Man"" by The Kinks
""El Paso"" by Old 97s
""Mike Kalinsky"" by Clem Snide
""The Touch"" by Stan Bush

i felt i played lot of music and that a lot of it was quite awesome.

i also felt i did better than usual when coming back to the radio from a long break, but i still need to work on my speaking skills.

i ended up dedicating two songs on the show: 1) ""Walk Hard"" to my roommate, Mike, and 2) ""El Paso"" to my grandmother.
i miss her.

i was quite pleased to look through the new Gorillaz ""D-Sides"" album, tho.  Awesome concept art for ""Demon Days"" album art, music videos and the ""Return of the Ogre"" book that was released shortly the album.
also found out that the station has some of the Blur albums that i don't have, so i need to find somebody with a lap top that's willing to come in so i can copy them plus others instead of wasting time/blank cds trying to copy them on their superslow computers.

played a track from the ""Juno"" soundtrack, too, i guess for Valentine's Day.  i still want to see it even tho my art history professor said it was kind of cliche and contrived with it's soundtrack and plot hooks.

instead here are some ""inspirational"" things that i wrote on post-its and post-ited all over my desk.  thought it'd be good to spread to the internets so that when my attention starts to drift to here i may come across this and regain confidence as well as a slap of sense..or something.

if you begin to surf, draw instead!!

no more fuck ups!  you only fail if you don't do it!!!

fail early so you will have time to fix it!!!

you aren't the best but you will get there if you actually try!!!

1 learn
2 make great art
3 get good grades

hero fotos to print and post ( it thought it'd be good to see who i'm trying to become successful like, whom i'd hope to work with or become peers or whatever, and who i am trying to make proud)
-scott c
-tim schafer
-my grandmother
-my mother/brother/father
-craig mccracken
-angela
-jackie chan
-bryan lee o'malley/corey lewis/brendan graham


that's pretty much all i have right now.  i know it's sappy, but whatever.
and i know that i've probably voiced it before in previous entries or conversation if i've spoken to you face to face but i some how have issues when it comes to working on art work for a school assignment.
1 i tend to be lazy, plain and simple
2 i tend to be antsy because what if i screw up?

well no shit there is going to be the chance i am going to screw up.  because i am lazy i start late on my project, usually the night before, so when i get pretty far along on a project i'm afraid of screwing up because i may not be able to fix it or have enough time to restart it.
i guess i also get antsy about screwing up because i'm afraid that...if i screw up too much then i may not have enough supplies availible to me when the art store is closed?...and those get pretty expensive.  i don't want to get a shit load and have excess paper that i may not use though i con myself into thinking that there are future projects i could use it for.

i'm looking for pity...and even in writing that i feel kind of egotistical because i'd go so far as to assume you'd possibly have that for me...but....i dunno..i'm a sad person people.  not sad blue, sad pathetic.

i think i just need to

1 finish this semester
2 catch up on sleep through
  a more sleep
  b earlier bed time
  c better diet (burger king does not a body good)
  d exercise
  e no stress (it's not the end of the world.  everyone EVERYONE tells me this...but somehow i never manage to believe them)

 there are some other things too...i will edit this later when my brain regains conscienceness (see that's not even spelled right, is it?)
i also wanted to re do this post and figure out how to set the words of common sense posted at the top of my journal so that i will see them at the top every time i come to it."

today actually ended up being a pretty awesome show.  just grabbed some bands i hadn't played in a couple of shows and new albums from favorite bands.  awesome.  dunno what else to say.  was happy that the Asian Kung-Fu Generation song was pretty up-beat.  didn't recognize the song so i thought it might have been one of their mellower songs i found a video of on youtube.  plus, i found The Blood Brothers in the metal section.  kinda of weird but still sort of fits.

just need to make sure i get my Herbie Hancock tickets soooooon.

wow, today was something else.

was supposed to be my Halloween themed show.  had some awesome songs picked and my cd ready to go.  it worked after turning the cd player off and on like suggested but i eventually had to open the cd tray and plug in the track number so it would set to that one.  so that's why there are seconds/minutes of dead air in between some songs and why i came on to fill space.

Angela (from my Figure Illustration class) came on my show today, too! :D  so that was fun.
s'always fun to have somebody new in studio to chill with.

anyway, she was pretty good about talking on air even tho she said she didn't want to.

dunno what to say other than i was happy/pissed my cd finally worked/eventually quite before show's end, and that Angela came on and it was fun.

hopefully it turned out alright.  i think i'll actually have to listen to this one. :B

same damn thing happened this week that it did last week.  i tried burning my mix at 32x instead of 48x but the cd players in the studio still couldn't read it.  shit. : \
mad dashing and such again.
i think it's the cds, not my writer.....i think?...i hope.

and i didn't realize that Modest Mouse song said ""fuck"" and other profane things.  shit.  whoops.  didn't know that cuz it wasn't marked in the review, plus never heard that track before, plus i played it during my dash for music.
oh well.  i know now.

i never went to see Ghostface Killah.  went to see Ratatouille.  that was probably more awesome since i'm not familiar with his beats.
possibly going to see Hot Hot Heat this weekend?   maybe.  not sure.  need to find out more info.

wow.  today only sucked because i wasted an hour putting together an awesome cd to play for my show and the cd players in the studio ended up being unable to read it.  oh well. shit happens i guess.
i doubt that girl i told to listen to my show actually listened so oh well to that, too...

couldn't think of what to play or what to say.  had to come up with quick banter and ended up playing songs i was familiar with for the second half of the show.

need to finish up projects.  bleh.  hope i have enough energy to finish my paper tomorrow night and turn in before midnight so i'll have the energy to see GHOSTFACEKILLAHHHH on Wednesday. (he's playing at the UofA union for the [adult swim] tour.) (duh.)

oh yeah, and Stacey didn't come on my show this time.  i talked to her but never got back to her about details.  i think i'll work something out so she can come on the show before Halloween so we can play spooky shit.  yeah.

anyway, if you're interested in listening check the links belowwww.  i think i might actually listen to this show. seemed like a good line-up and i actually haven't listened to myself in quite a long time...

only thing that pissed me off was that i couldn't find any Thrice. :(

plus i didn't go to Arctic Monkeys last week.  went and saw Paprika instead...but i think you already knew that.

did i miss !!! coming to Tucson?  or have they not been here yet?....

"event","i saw <a href=""http://imdb.com/find?s=all&q=paprika"">Paprika</a> tonight at The Loft.  it was AWESOME.  the sort of really pretty crazy thing that you would expect from the guy who wrote and directed Paranoia Agent.  same composer, too, which was awesome.

it was awesome but...now i feel empty.  like...i'm incomplete or...things feel lackluster now...i dunno...

i do believe i will be looking into more animation grad school programs tho than other kinds.  other kinds like...print making? (would be interesting since the stuff that my friend Danny does is awesome and is the kind of stuff that i like)...or maybe...watercolor? (my mom brought up that i said i didn't like watercolor before.  this is possible.  it was pretty annoying early on...but i guess practice makes increased competence.  and it's the instuctor i don't like.  not watercolor.  i'm getting...sorta..better at it..like with the prismacolor markers.  i just need to do it more to build up more competence/confidence/skill.)...or maybe....sequential art or something.  i dunno.  i'll just need to look into it more.  writing like this just got annoying so i'm just going to stop, go to bed and look into it in the morning.

"event","work was GODDAMN.  i say GODDAMN.
it was okay but slightly aggravating cuz my brain was on fuzz and i was totally out of it from exhaustion(?).  got better towards the last few hours but not much better.  brain on fire and i wanted to stab my eyes out to make them feel better. and i was slightly deaf which didn't help trying to do register.  sure i pissed some people off but whatever.  more worried bout my ears than some people.  still sucked tho.
and as it came closer to my shift being over it was damned if i do damned if i don't because once i got off work i just had all my homework for me to finish, but if i stayed...more work at the coffee shop.  couldn't stay really because shift ends at 8 but...y'know.
anyway.
i guess i'm a bad influence because i got my roommate and his girlfriend hooked on WE <3 KATAMARI.  god it's been so long since i've played that game.  so fun.  forgot how much fun.  on the level where you roll the world i seriously had the largest katamari i've ever rolled in that game.  about 1,500 m.  ridiculous.  seriously.  but i couldn't save it because my memory card is funky on my roommate's playstation and will load but won't save.  sad/aggravating, but at least he's nice enough to let me save to his and continue my rolling rampage.  i'll get back to that 1,500 m someday.

yeah.  my roommate's totally hooked on katamari.  awesome.  maybe i'll get Beautiful Katamari for 360 once that comes out and then sell it to him when the year's over, considering i don't have the console and i'm sure he wouldn't minde playing the game.

now i need to go watercolor something..anything...can't think of what...shit....and do fig illustration...and....study for my weather exam on friday...and....a figure illustration quiz tomorrow...and....a japanese structure quiz tomorrow....and....stuff...(oh, Lisa, i'm taking jpn 101...so i'm still trying to get the basics down :P)...and i need to get around to emailing scott-c so i can get info for a presentation on him in my watercolor class.
i feel slightly better...more relaxed...still tired...but...i dunno i should go work and stop making this entry so emo/complainy.  i think i'll go back through some time and just hide all those kinds of posts...fun!"

well....it's a new year.  and it's fall.  so it's been a while since i've done this.  need to ease myself back in so i'm not nervous.  plus it doesn't help i'm tweaking from class projects so that's why i'm feeling all unconfident and stuff.

but personal stuff is lame; let's not bring it up.

the library is a wreck.  couldn't find the new Busdriver or Modest Mouse albums.  fuck.  that means i probably won't be able to get copies of them. :(
i also still need a name for my radio show by wednesday?  what the hell?  they said it doesn't look professional on the schedule if i don't have a name for my show up.  whatever.  i proposed <lj user=""empiezando"">'s suggestion of ""Suck It,"" but they told me to keep working on it.  i think i'm going to go with ""Listen Here.""  that sounds....fun.  whatever.  i'll have a name but i won't need to use it.  like...""the program formerly unlabled""...  or..something.

i mean...i should be able to?  because i'm filling out the forms and stuff right now and will turn that and the money in Monday but....i guess i'm just hoping i'll get a time slot that won't suck ass.  i was hoping for either Monday at 2pm or Sunday at 4pm.  why?  because all other times suck.  ass. A.S.S.

<a href=""http://kamp.arizona.edu/node/49"">see for yourself.</a>

i am most likely not going to be doing a show with Jack this fall because I have not spoken to him in about two weeks (since I got my hangars back from him) and he told me that he wasn't sure anyway since he said his schedule looked pretty busy.  i guess that's pretty understandable since this is his last year.  anyway, i'm going for it.  primarily because i would feel empty if i was no longer a part of the KAMP collective.  secondarily because i still need to copy a shit load of old stuff and need to listen to the new stuff that's coming out.  possibly find some hidden goodness in the current releases.

but i'll have a show.  just don't know what time. :P  so i was wondering...what should i call it?  the show.  i don't have enough creativity to not make the name suck or sound as generic as mainstream radio.  name.  must.  rock.  RAWK.

i guess i don't need a show name....i'll just try to be sly and not mention a show name but if someone asks i'll just try to bullshit or something.  i dunno.  WHATAMITAHDEW?"

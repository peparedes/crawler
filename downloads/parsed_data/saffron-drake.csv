Fate is such a funny lady sometimes. Here I spent the past three years all but throwing myself at fellows' feet, and professing my undying love for them, and in the single month that I do no such thing, I <s>come close to</s> Fate is a funny thing.

Jared! Oh, Jared, Jared, I haven't the slightest idea what that was about. It must have been the moonlight, or the dancing, or my dress cutting off circulation to the brain or something. I'm glad that nothing happened though, no kisses or anything like that, but something <i>almost</i> did. Almost. <s>I've been wondering whether or not the knot in my stomach was due to the anxiousness of what almost happened, or disappointment of what didn't.</s> Either way, the ball, and everyone in it, looked lovely.

Spoke with Howl, and things are straightened out. Thank goodness.

Then there's Viggo. All I can say is: Good gracious. And turn a horrid scarlet from beyond these pages. Again, lips are still intact and unsullied, but what temptation! And I hardly know him! I reckon if I hadn't held a book to my lips, things would have turned out much differently.

Is that supposed to happen? I thought you only feel those kind of things when you're in love. That's how all the stories go, anyway. How terribly confusing."

<i>The following entry is splattered by drops of water, smearing some of the ink and dampening the pages in places: </i>

Hello again, journal!

I ran into Emory today, this time at the lake. What a dashing bloke! Sylvia is such a lucky girl-- He's so very wry! And his scars? Marvellous! A true man's-man, so to say, without coming across as a stupid brute. We talked about this and that, including a subject I hadn't quite expected: Our parents. Apparently his are dead as well. Usually I don't feel awkward talking about it (it happened such a long time ago, after all!) but sometimes I wonder if that's wrong. If maybe I'm too blunt? When he told me his parents had been killed as well, I wasn't sure what to say. 'I'm sorry'? What good does that do? I hope he knew I could understand his grief, without my having to say too much about it. The mood was swift to lighten, at least. Like I told him, were he not promised to someone whom I highly respect, I'd go foolishly batty over him.

On a completely different note, I continue to flail in Potions. I tried to resist straying from the instructions when I set out for my independent study today, and I promised myself I'd just use the ingredients that were provided! Alas, my curiosity got the better of me, and after that extra pinch of eye of newt, I knew I'd meet failure again.

<i>Added later:</i>

My dress just arrived! I couldn't be any more thrilled about it-- It's exactly what I wanted. It's a shame, though, that I still haven't found Jared to speak with. I'm afraid that he's avoiding me due to unresolved...ah...anger towards me. Perhaps once I find him he'll have cooled down and I needn't listen to <i>quite</i> as much complaining."

My, my, journal, have I been busy!

I think the first thing I should say, in order to clear my conscience, is that I lied to Howl. He asked me to the dance, and rather than be mature and politely turn him down, I panicked and said that I'd already been asked by Jared. I didn't wish to hurt his feelings, you see, and I always take it better when I find out I've been rejected because that particular person is already in a relationship. He said the nicest things afterward, Howl I mean, and it made me feel all the more rotten. I'm sure when I actually speak with Jared I'll feel even worse-- He's going to skin me for sure. Of course I wouldn't mind him coming to the dance with our group, as he's a fun chap, but he'll see it far differently. I don't think he even really registers me as a <i>girl-girl</i>, but that's alright. Things are nice and simple that way.

On a far brighter note, I had a lot of fun speaking with Howl, Joshua, and Starla.  It's amazing what a few costumes and a lot of imagination can do. Robin Hood! Imagine that. I love the theatre, I really do. I'm going to research it, and see if I can't find out about its origins, and why it's in the current condition that it is now. Would it be possible to fix it up to its former glory?

I don't know, but I aim to find out."

Not terribly much to report this time, journal, other than a few key points of interest. 

Tonight I had a nice chat with Grania. With school and such, we haven't had much time to talk; but tonight we acted like a pair of girls and gave each other facials. I made the goop myself! Oatmeal, honey, and lemon. It smelled nice, but felt rather odd. We talked about the dance to come and our dates, or in my case a lack thereof, and decided that going as a group might be the best thing. There's a lot of pressure either way, with or without a date, and this way things will be more relaxed.

I also met a Housemate by the name of Kazin. We played with my waterwand for a little while, and just chatted about this and that. He seems like a nice bloke, all in all, and have a feeling that we're to be friends.

Perhaps most exciting of all, I spoke with a few people yesterday and had the grand idea of putting on some sort of dinner theatre! Given this evolved from  just storming the Great Hall during dinnertime in full pirate regalia, but I think it's a smashing idea. Acting has always been something I've loved, whether just reciting lines from my favorite books, or merely making things up on the spot. It's a shame there isn't more theatre and cinema in wizarding culture; I could really see myself getting involved in it. There's still muggle scenes, of course, but I'm not sure if it would be the same. In any case, I've enough costumes to house a full cast, so I doubt it would be too difficult to organize.

I guess the question is: Would anyone wish to play along with me?"

"event","Oh journal! You wouldn't believe the fun that I had with Val.

We met on the battlements yesterday; he glaring at the rain and I silently praising it. We talked about many topics of interest, mainly my curiosity regarding Native Americans and their earthbound magic, but our time together hit its peak when he agreed to play pirates with me! Because we agreed to prepare first, I even had time to change into my costume-- A rather dashing attire, I must say; and he did his best with what he had. I leant him a handkerchief for his head, and a temporary tattoo for his forearm. Needless to say we had a lot of fun, and it should be noted that Val is nothing short of a superb actor. I hope we'll meet again soon to continue our story, and perhaps encourage those I've assigned pirate names to join us.

Things today were equally pleasant. I came across Dillion, Jonathan, and Patrick in the midst of a mudfight, and gladly joined them in it. I was particularly victorious with Dillion-- Mud on his face <i>and</i> down his shirt, but then he grabbed me and used me as a shield. And Jonathan, an entertaining chap that I'm quite glad I had the chance of getting to know, had the gall to stuff mud in my mouth! I laughed though, and condoned the action out of the sheer sneakiness of it. All's fair in love and war, as they say. Afterward Dillion and I raced across the lake. He beat me, of course, but I kept up with him until the very ending.

Oh, and Erasma showed up in the midst of it. I admit she's not my favorite person, though I was glad to see her relax and romp with us. She's <i>far</i> too serious for a girl her age.

What a grand week! I'm a bit sorry that not many people remembered or knew my birthday, but that's a selfish thing to be concerned about. I'm quite happy and grateful with life right now, and I wouldn't change anything! Well... except, perhaps, the fact that spring has driven everyone into romantic coupling. Ah well, I suppose romance isn't <i>everything</i>. In all the good books, it's merely a subplot. Indeed, a subplot! That's a fine way to think of it. If I am forced to go stag to the dance, well, then stag it is. I'm sure I'll have a jolly time just mingling and seeing my friends. Mostly. Good for Grania. I hope she'll let herself enjoy the evening without feeling guilty.

Ah well, it's late. I'll leave it there for now. Goodnight, journal."

One day until my birthday! Like I told a few people, fourteen isn't exactly a momentous age, and I'm not too keen on growing up, but I can't help but be excited anyhow; especially if Grandfather manages to find me a flying horse, or a certain gypsy remembers that he owes me a ditty. Either one would make me pleased as punch!

Today, after helping out some of the first years with their History, I ran into a small troupe of students in the commons and had a nice chat. There was Starla, Sylvia, Erik, and a boy I hadn't met before named Aluksander. Starla was a joy as always, as was Sylvia, though I see the latter considerably less than the former. She seems so very kind, it was nice talking with her for a little while; she even said I could help decorate the hall for the ball! (Oh! That rhymes, how delightful!). Given I probably won't have a date, but that's neither here nor there. 

As for Aluksander, well... I don't know what to make of him. To be honest? He seems like a rude, opinionated little boy who judges others without giving himself a proper examination. I guess he hates girls and refuses to be friends with them; assuming they're all stupid and girly as if he were an eight year old. This being even after I expressed my adoration for pirates, and my wanting to play swashbucklers with him. And, of course, for sticking up for him when Erik started to tease him. He still flat out said he didn't want to be friends because I'm a girl! Ah well, one can't expect an immature little boy to show too much sense, can they? Either way, he was quite rude to Tyler, and it raised my blood a little bit. At least he had the sense to apologize after Grania and I gently reprimanded him.

I hate bullies, I really do. Or at least people who are smug enough to put themselves on a pedestal. Though ... hate is a strong word, so I guess I can settle with 'feel sorry for'.

It was nice seeing Grania again, and I think given some time we could become good mates. She liked the pirate name I gave her, and it made me all the more glad. 

Herald! The dread pirate Coffin Connie!"

Oh, journal, you won't <i>believe</i> the mischief that Starla and I are up to. When she gushed about what a great idea I had, I felt right proud! It's going to be nothing short of grand. I can't wait!

My, my, I've been so busy lately! It's been the good kind of busy, however, so I can't really complain. The schoolwork hasn't been too difficult for me (except for blasted Potions!), nor overly time consuming, so I've still managed to keep up with life's simpler pleasures between coursework. Oh! That's actually how I met Dealey. I'd been reading 'Treasure Island' in the library for what must be the fourth time, and by chance he encountered my little nook as he was checking out a book that he, similarly, had read many times. To spice things up we swapped texts and promised to meet later on to compare. I never knew how interesting photography could be. Perhaps I'll write to grandfather for a new camera.

Speaking of which, when I was on safari by the edge of the forest with my camera, I met a nice gypsy boy by the name of Bexhet.  He was terribly dashing! And funny! And handsome! And a <i>gypsy</i>! At odds with my boy situation, I asked if he'd kiss me so that I could just get it over with, not to mention because he was so charming. But he didn't. Yet another person with a loved one. I'm quite heartbroken about it all. I daresay I wasn't in love with him, but I <i>was</i> quite smitten.

Woe! I fear I'm destined to be alone for all eternity! An old maid! One who can only recall her youth with tears and groans! Whose hope wasted away like the dripping of a candle's wax beneath the flame of her deficiency! 

(Note to self: 'Flame of her deficiency'. How poetic, I must use it sometime!)

Anyway, we Drakes are supposed to be charming, and even playboys! Maybe I'll write home and ask for some advice.

On a brighter note, I met a nice girl by the name of Issa the other day. We spoke of pirates and exchanged our designated pirate names. I, Black-Hearted Belle, the dreaded Pirate Princess of the seven seas, and she, Cutthroat Izzy. I helped her think of a suitable tale for her character. Hopefully she and Starla and I can play together sometime. Oh! And Tyler too. I was so proud of him, because he agreed to learn how to climb a tree. I took him about halfway up before we climbed back down. He was scared but he did it anyway. Good for him!

And finally? I told Erik the bad news about 'us' but he handled it like a man. Good show, Erik. Way to be strong."

"event","The holidays are finally over! I'm filled with mixed sentiments, to be honest. On one hand, I'll be returning to Hogwarts where all my friends are, and where I'll get to resume my studies. Then, on the other hand, I won't get to be with my family, and I'll be cooped up in the school for months until the next Hogsemeade weekend. 

I suppose there are two options: To be disappointed with what I won't have, or to be happy with the perks. I'll choose the latter.

<s>At least there's <i>one</i> thing I can be happy about with no strings attached. Erik. I know I've said it before about other boys, but I'm <i>quite</i> sure that I'm in love! Not just a silly crush, but LOVE! The moment I saw his face I knew it, too. That jaw and those eyes! Like I told Bryce, I'd probably have to be the knight in the relationship, and he the damsel, but that means little. So long as we are together forever I'll be happy.

...I might have put in a few inquiries about him. Just a few! It's the only thing to do, really. And now I can make some serious decisions:

<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3

Saffron Vitoria Drake-Whittington

<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3</s>

Dillion! Dillion Drillock is my true love! Too bad he has a girlfriend. I'll just have to pine for him in agony until my dying day.

Love life aside, I also had a jolly time on the train to Hogwarts. I found a compartment with that sweet girl Starla, and also that harsh girl Erasma, and a bloke I don't know named Patrick, his girlfriend, and later on Grania. Patrick seemed to be upset about something so I hauled him into the compartment and made him sit and listen to one of my jokes. It was...

What do you call a prehistoric monster when sleeping?

...A dinosnore! Hahaha!

We all got along marvellously, and it significantly lifted my spirits for the day. Hogwarts, ho!"

"event","One night, I had a cigarette that would not stay lit. I tried twice, yet I 
failed each time to keep the ember glowing. Eventually, I gave up, and threw 
the entire thing away. I pulled out another cigarette and it lit immediately.

A short time later, I saw a faint red glow coming from the garbage can in the 
corner. I walked over to it and saw the contents burning. The heat made my eyes 
tear and I dropped the second cigarette on the floor. I went to pick up the one 
I dropped and within seconds the can had burst into flames, so I grabbed the 
entire thing and brought it outside, scorching myself in the process.

Well, this didn't really happen, but the moral of the story is this:
If you give up too easily on something, it will come back to burn you."

"event","I used to be brilliant. Head of the class, winning awards. 
Absolutely gifted. And I knew I could achieve anything.

I used to be an athlete. Boys quivered in fear when the ball 
was in my hands, and my force was not to be reckoned with.

I used to be formidable. My presence was powerful 
and influential. No one could touch me. No one.

I used to be happy. Then one day, I became beautiful.

I want out. Look at my position. Surrounded by people,
yet always alone. Talked at, not talked to. I am not a trophy. 
Or so I would like to believe.

And as I watch my life play out before my eyes, 
as I watch my lifeless and mindless body on the corner of that bed, 
I keep telling myself: I am not a trophy, I am not a trophy..."

"event","The space between sheets is not as inviting as it used to be, not when 
I'm alone. Saturday is 6 days away, but I find it hard to understand 
the meaning of days. I no longer have a concept of time; its meaning 
vanishes when you wake as your lover sleeps. Dreams contain nothing 
but perfect strangers, an indication of how lonely I feel.

I suppose that no matter what I say or how hard I try, 
some things never change. I promised myself, ""never again,"" 
yet here I am, incapable of being alone.

And sadly, there isn't much else worth writing about."

"event","I have this urge to leave my house.
For whatever reason, I can't stand being here.
It's been weeks since I've come home before 2am.
And let me tell you, tonight will be no different.

I wish I could slow down.
I wish I could get a grip.
I wish this wasn't hollow.
It shouldn't be so hard to sit still.

Hold me or hold me down."

"event","If I keep myself busy, I don't have time to think about misery.
If I keep myself awake, nightmares won't ravage my mind.
If I keep myself moving, I won't fall apart.

Well, that made little-to-no sense at all. Let's just say that the next few days will be insanely busy (just the way I like it).

-Thursday is CSI and a job interview.
-Friday is the show at Glen Cove Lanes.
-Saturday is the poetry jam in the city.
-Sunday is Vogelfest: Part 2.

I have a bruise on my eyelid and I don't know how it got there. My shins are all beat up and my face is still in the healing process from the other mysterious injuries. When does this happen? What have I forgotten? Why is this happening? Is my life so unbearable that my brain just blocks it out? 
No, this is not substance related.
I'm confused and scared and the only thing I can do is keep moving...."

"event","so important are the experiences that we have once but never again. 
if you offered them to me, to have them again, i would turn it away.

why, you ask?

because their value is in their rarity. 
if we could have it back to do over and over again, it would be worthless.
instead of crying when something ends, instead of mourning a loss, celebrate the fact that you ever had it to begin with."

"event","my head hurts and i feel hollow. but at least i made it home in one piece.

at least i got to see you tonight. sorta. <3
""i love you for who you are."" you said it. and i feel the same way. i love you, just you, nothing but you, in your simplest, clearist, purist state.
i hope you know what i'm trying to say.

the look in your eyes was empty and bare,
i saw your face but you weren't really there.
so pardon me while i cry myself to sleep,
tomorrow i have a promise to keep."

"event","for now, i take the terror and pour it into the page.

...and he takes your hands in his as he takes you to a place where you didn't want to go. 
images flash through your head as your watch your life play out in front of your very eyes 
only to realize that it's happening right now and you're powerless to stop it. 

...and the room spins underneath you as the bedsheets crumple with your paper heart
you always hated when things wrinkled except for the laugh lines on my face
which i want to show you but i can't find the means or the ways to smile at you anymore

as you look away from the eyes of corruption, the faces in your head turn the other way. you are alone. you are alone. you will never be as alone as you are when you become one with someone else. 

...and feel the dripping down your forehead. wonder what it is and why it has to be this way. 
your body screams that it isn't your fault but your brain isn't listening to anything
except the sound of your eyes burning because the tears aren't strong enough to put out the flames

as you look away from the eyes of corruption the faces in your head turn the other way. you are alone. you are alone. you will never be as alone as you are when you become one with someone else.

there. done. i feel better. and they say that bloodletting was outdated."

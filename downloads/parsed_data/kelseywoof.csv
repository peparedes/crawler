"event","I heard some news  about my father  from Zane....I should have felt happy. But I didn't. I felt....abandoned? I know he couldn't take me. I would be nothing but a burden, a weakness that could be too easily exploited. I hope my brother is doing well also. Small things remind me of them both. It wouldn't have bothered me so much I think but Momma is gone too. Just on vacation, but I keep thinking about Nick and Alyssa. They were due back and they never made it. Bo was gone  and I never got to see him again. Lex....The list goes on. How do you stop the hurt from being so bad. I could put up the walls and keep everyone out. But that's not who I am. I can close my eyes and I know how each of these people touched me differently. Physically and emotionally. I'm an adult dammit. Wolf and Human. And i'm pining about things like a child. There are times I don't think I'm going to make it. I think Part of my problem is that I never expected ta live this long. I was sure that I would be caught and killed for whatever reason long before this. Hell, Trin is doin better then I am. There are those around me that I still love. But I feel fear when I'm near them. Will I get too close, just in time for them to die or leave? I don't want to lose anyone else. And I'm sure that my pack finds me to be a broken record. You think that you've gotten past the skipping, like the record will play all the way through, but then it jumps back to where it was. Filling you with more disappointment. I spent time with Hunter and Penni. They want to make a threesome. I'm not objecting. The pleasure of the body can at least dull the pain of the mind....at least for a little bit. Between sex and maybe feeding vampires, perhaps life won't feel so bad. Or at least when my death comes, the pain won't be quite so bad.  WHy must everything fall apart just when I'm sticking the last piece on the top of the stack. That bit of joy, that will just make the rest of the world fall into place never gets all the way there and my world crashes around me."

"event","I know I've been neglecting this thing terribly. Its even chewed on in one corner now where pejuta got it. That's the name of my new kitten. Or I usually just call him magic. He's a orange and black splashed kitten. I really love him. Leksi Hariel had him sleep in one of my shirts for most of his younger life. Perhaps there's a reason why small animals are supposed to fear shifters.

Would you believe that it tries to take down Hunter? Hunter says he's going to show him who's boss one of these days. I told him he's just jealous of the furrball.  But at least now I have something that can purr to me when Hunter has to go back to the other cats. I can't believe he is an alpha now. Its so awesome. He has become a great friend and a most loved partner. I call him my mate....but do I have a right to? It feels right. But sometimes I wonder if I gave him a choice ta be...or if one of those times I was at my weakest that I brought it up and he let me call him it to let me feel better. I'll have to ask him. I got so many gifts for my birthday. A motorcycle....In most cases I'd have said, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING! But ummmmm I like it way too much to complain. I've been mostly teachin myself. I was using the parkin garage at first ta learn. But then there was the little red sportscar I dinged ever so slightly. I popped the dent back out. Luckily those cars are made of plastic anyway. But I'm sure if I put anything more severe on ANY cars, I'll be as black and blue as my motorcycle. So in the meantime, I've become the scourge of the neighborhood gardners. Something about therian speed and adjusting course a LITTLE too quickly. I also got stuffed leopards and wolves, statues, a dream catcher, a painting, I hope I've not forgotten anything. I love them all and most all of it is in my bedroom. I did that on purpose. So that when I do wake up with the nightmares, I can look around and see that I'm safe and very loved. Oh and one of my favorite gifts is the blade Keahi gave me. I've been tryin ta learn ta wear it like Keahi. But well....maybe therian skin is a bit more sensitive then vampire. He's only got A hundred years of practice? Its his own steel knife and its all handcarved and stuff. I'vegot ta learn ta use it correctly to make Keahi proud. That and ta have a good way ta protect myself.

Wow, so much stuff has happened recently, there's been kidnappins, murders, lost lovedones returnin home. I wish ther was some way to get the human firster's ta leave us alone. Or hell, let's just infect the whole damn lot of em and they'll either conform or there will be very little hunting needing to be done at a few lupanars. They're makin innocent people into shifters by their attacks on us. Unfortunately, they're going to end up getting IDs of people more then they have and get us marked fer infectin others that THEY injured. I'm really scared. I think I'll write more later, Hunter should be home soon and curlin up with him and Pejuta seems ta make all my worries go away. Somethin about kitties and that purrin stuff."

"event","Hah, found the stupid journal. I swear I put it somewhere else. Oh well. Man, where to start now. Tonight is a big night for me. I feed Zadkiel his first meal. I was told that he won't be the same at first. And that well, I'm pretty much a walkin juicebox. I don't care. This is something I want and am prepared to do. I don't have a tribe thing or anything like that to spur me on like Zadkiel did. I wish I coulda been there when he died. But we said goodbye a few days before. He even shared his blood with me. OUr own way of blood brothers. Me and Zad spoke for a few hours, then we slept in the sunlight on the nude beach curled up together. Dinner afterwards. Man, it felt like I was doin my last runs with my brother on death row. He trusts Keahi and so that's what I'm gonna do too. Just put my trust in him. Once this is done, it'll be time to face my parents. I'm tired of hidin. And if I am ever gonna prove my worth, then I need to get movin now. I got to do my half form. Boy remind me never to piss off Zane. And on top of that I came about 3 steps from wanting to just friggin slam Trinity. I guess she wants to feed Hariel. But she is going to endanger my chances to feed Zadkiel in the process just cause she's jealous? Oh fuck her and the amnesia express she rode in on. Sigh....shouldn't get upset. I just need to relax for tonight. I will be gettin bit by Keahi after bein rolled. So its rather anticlimatic. But its the thought and blood that counts."

"event","Man I can't trust anyone it seems! Hariel, Faith and Zane all worked together to set me up! They hid one of the foals and made me find it. And Zane was asking me all sorts of questions. I looked all over and found it. And helped rescue it. And it was a set up! This was my adult hood test! I'm adult! Well, in the therian world. Now where the hell is Zadkiel and Griffin when i need them. Time ta paint the town....PINK! Yeah pink! That sounds like fun! Oh this is going to be so awesome. I can't believe it. I still can't believe it."

"event","Here I was, supposed to graduate this month. And I've been told pretty much not to hold my breath. WHat am I gonna tell Keahi and Zadkiel. What am i gonna tell everyone who said that I just needed to wait till this month. I failed again. And this time I didn't do anything wrong. I don't know what ta do. I can't break the rules though it is tempting. Zadkiel...I'm so sorry. My heart is breaking just with the thoughts of doin as I'm told. Why did this have to happen. WHY! It was a single mistake. Why must I keep payin fer it. I can't face them. And I can't run away.  I'll sleep in the basement at Grace's house. I don't want Zadkiel to see my tears. It hurts so much."

"event","So many things have happened. And....well I can't believe it. It was supposed to be Zadkiel's birthday. I got him this unicorn incense burner....and I....I got a family. Part of me thinks that this just can't be true. Maybe I'm dreaming. Maybe I've been rolled and I'll just wake up. But...Keahi asked me to join his family. Keahi and Grace and Zadkiel. A family....That's what I've wanted. Someone I can turn to for love and protection. Someone that's there. I have a human mother and father. But...they can't raise me or take care of me. And I dont' think they'd want to. I'm dead to them right now literally in their eyes. But I think that once they find out what I am....I'll be dead figuratively. I've always had a strong attachment to Grace. Maybe call it baby duck syndrome. But she was the first wolf I remember when I showed up here, a lost and wounded pup. To be able to call her my mom. And Keahi, I've considered a father figure fer a while. And now I can call him it. This isn't to say I don't love Scott and Merideth and the rest of the pack. But...but it isn't fair to them to expect them to play parents to me. Especially with everything that's going on. Merideth has always seemed more of the big sister who almost reluctantly watches her brother. But actually cares alot. And Scott...Scott  won't see me as anything but a younger brother. I can still be that. But well...sometimes I need someone to run to. To cry to that won't see me as some weak pup that has to be protected. I'm a wolf. But there are just times I need to be held and I...I don't want Scott and them to realize how often that is. 

But I have a family. HOw do I tell the others without offending them. I still love and am very protective of my pack. I don't know. And ta have Zadkiel as my brother. I...I have regrets though. Everyone else will live forever. And they...they will watch me die. Not that a vampire's life is simple or long always. But. well...I don't really want them ta see me grow old. But that's not somethin I should think about now. I have a very long time. At this rate....It'll be be an extra year or so before I LOOK more mature. A family! How many times did I watch Zadkiel with Grace and Keahi and feel nothing but envy. I shouldn't have but my wolf wants the contact more then anything. Me...I...I never was terribly close to my parents. And I think that's why I crave it so now. I think I can watch Zadkiel and Keahi together now....They love me too. That's the important thing. Oh! And I almost forgot. I offered Grace the chance ta change my name if she wished. Keahi picked Zadkiel's....and he'll be a vampire soon. Me..I'll always be a werewolf like Grace. And I'll be there to feed Zadkiel when he rises for the first time. I have to be. 

I can't believe I have a family....."

"event","SIGH! You know things are bad if you decide that perhaps keeping a journal might be a good idea. But considering what I've been asked to do....well. It might be a good idea to keep a record. I've been asked to help train Trinity. I keep hoping that it won't be as bad as I suspect it will be. But dread is definately something that comes to mind. 

Of course this might have something to do with our visitors. We have the geek squad from Chicago here. It seems that Merideth and Madison have a mutual friend who decided to check out the San Francisco scene. Unfortunately, I doubt they're here to celebrate Gay Pride. There's just four of them....that we know of. Their leader is a big guy, the sort that pretends that he's doing something to be nice but is really doing his best to be an all out bastard. There's a BIG black dude. He was 'attempting' to be polite. And there were two women. Of course ONE has to ask me how school was. CRAP! How was I supposed to answer that? Well, I think I did okay. Scott seemed to approve. But I don't like these people. Oh and then there's Zane. You know I have done my best to show support for him. But what he did....He EVALUATED US!  Not just that, he blamed Scott for bringing me with. I'M NOT A NEW PUP! ANd yes I was quiet and stuff. But when Silver says don't speak out and stuff, well....I'm gonna keep my mouth SHUT! Yes I was a little nervous. But who wouldn't be. But to suggest I'd be a convert? BASTARD! This is my pack. THis is my home. And NO ONE is going to take me away from here without a fight. I'm not a baby. I've made mistakes but I will NEVER betray my pack. 

Okay, well now I've been sent to Faith and Hariel's ranch. Normally I'd be more then willing to be here. But its obvious that part of the reason is to get me out of the way. I want to be with my pack. I don't want to lose them. I never got to say goodbye to so many of the others. To be here...away from them when something bad could happen. Its upsetting me alot. The only good thing that happened was Griffin being by. HOw I miss him when he's gone. He makes me feel safe and loved. ANd he doesn't judge me to the standards of the pack. He loves me because of me. I hope I don't ever lose him. Its so hard to get attached to people anymore.  They keep leaving. But....I guess its part of growing up. I hate it. Sigh...

I'm think I better just try and relax. Oh and today is Zadkiel's birthday. I need to get him something special. I love him. I think as much as Griffin. But I'm not sure if its in the same way. He came from some of the worse situations ya could ever come from. ANd he's come out stronger. I wish I was that strong. He's going to be a vampire soon. And part of me is afraid for him. But this is what he wants. And I'm going to be there for him no matter what. Keahi said I could feed him when he first awakens. I want to ask if I can guard his three day sleep. I know my pack will shoot me if I'm around the house fretting. There's a chance he won't wake up when the three days are up. And if he does, that he won't be the same. I can't think about that. My job is to feed him and help him remember who he was. I am trusting my life to Keahi since Zadkiel won't be aware of himself when he wakes. He could possibly drain me dry. But I trust him. I trust them both. I wish there was something special I could do with Zadkiel before he is changed over. So much to think about. I think I'll write more later."

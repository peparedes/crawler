"event","hey.. today was okay.. ive been home all day.. but i've decided to list
all my friends and inside jokes cause i have no life haha.. this is
kind of random but like this year, i feel like i have lost so much.
Like out of friends, over the summer me and chelsea were like best
friends.. we did everything together&lt;3 and since school started we
hung out once, and we barley talk to eachother.. and last year me &amp;
rachel were really good friends and this year ive talked to her about 4
times. I just miss the way things used to be.. It feels like everyone
is getting into their own ""cliques"" of people and i just like stand
out. I mean i have really different friends but like i cant just hang
out with one group of people because i like all of my friends. Ahh ok
im just gonna name some friends off the top of my head cause im bored,
then im gonna write if we got closer this year or grew father apart, or
arent even friends anymore.. starting out with alyssa spiz. wow where
do i start, 4th &amp; 5th grade we were unseperable, then 6th grade
started and we totally grew 100% apart. I really miss being friends
with her but like everytime i try and sort things out, something
happens and we just never become freidns again. So yeah moving on.
Lauren, we were bffs last year, we are still good friends but in some
way we have grown apart, but thats oaky because we are still great
friends &lt;3 giana, last year we were also best friends, and this year
we still are really good friends so alot hasnt changed between
us..alaina, last year we werent really friends but only a little, but
this year you are one of my really good friends, we have really good
times ! haha breathe,streck,shake ! wow best dance &lt;3haha , allison,
BEST TIMES ever, we have never fought once=). Nicole, we just became
friends this year and its been soooo fun! hahah, bianca.. we have been
friends since i moved here and since you've moved we still havent grown
apart, your the best.. !!! noelle,we've had fights but we still manage
to be friends&lt;3 really fun times together*, jane w. really fun times
when we went to the same school but i still miss you ! haha. Ariel, wow
we just became bffs this year and you are still one of m bffs, great
times &lt;33 thats all i can really think of.. if i missed you, comment

I thouhgt this year was going to be so great but all it has been is straight out horrible. Ive lost over 9 friends..&nbsp;this sounds really cheesy but i just dont feel complete.. i feel like im missing something.. ahh i dk ive been so upset latley. My family is mean to me, my friends are betraying me.. stupid wierd people's mothers are accusing me and a couple of the friends i have of "" harassing/ bullying"" their daughter even though we dont even talk to her.. i am fed up with everyone and everything... i hate absolutley everything about this year.. nothing new, its all the same every single year.. assholes who do/say things that arent even true, and people have to deal with stuff they shouldnt even have to be dealing with.. UGH i hate this.. i feel so alone. Litterally i have about&nbsp;6 friends .. i have Ariel, Lori, Lauren, Alyssa, Allison, &amp; Alaina...and i can only pretty much trust less then half of them..&nbsp; wow.. i havent even finished with all my ""thoughts"" but i have to go cause my brother needs the computer.. well .. see you later&lt;3</P>

"event","i haven't written in a while.
this year is going along with so much emotional reflection and overwhelmingness, overwhelming. I'm afraid that it's the whole highschool repeat where it'slike, what the fuck where did the time go? so i'm doing a hundred thousand different things, writing for funny magazines, joined the video game club etc, and trying to pay bills and practice.I'm also writing at 10 43 am on a saturday cause i'm doing intern listening i suppose multi-tasking is allowed.
Anyway i have this horrible internship with harry fox agency with involves over two days of 9 hours wasted inputting songs in a system. It's really depressing because all the people there are like, ""yeah this is my day job"" and i really don't want that to happen to me. Post graduation life is like ten trucks on top of my head. I feel it's going to be impossible for me to find a day job that doesn't make me want to kill myself. I know that i can't sit behind a computer for 8 hours a day even though it has good pay and health benefits, but i don't know what the fuck i'm going to do. mostly it's because i fall outside of any structure, my dipolma does, and my life always has. It's just so open-ended that it's like, well i don't know what to do. it also doesn't help that i can't get a job to pay enough to live in new york, but we will see what happens. and all the boys always want FRIENDS
hmm, well i have those!
anyways, check out my song at www.songwriters-circle.com!
i will try to set up something for chicago where we all get together."

I know i haven't talked to some of you but i'm offering this to anyone. If you are in NYC or want to come up for a visit at anytime let me know and you can stay with us . THIS is the time to do it because after this year i have no idea what will happen in my life or where i'll be. Things are crazy with job planning and gig planning and trying to figure out how to do this. Needless to say, it's not the MEMORIES i miss, but the PEOPLE. and i really do miss you guys...and chicago!
so, please don't be afraid to call or email or facebook or myspace or www.whoreslut.com me"

"event","so i need something positive to focus on right now because my heart is kinda splitting.
this guy i've been seeing for a while ( who is or WAS) the best guy i've ever been seeing. Never in my life have i found someone who i literally spent every day thinking about, i honestly wanted to give my 13 yr old self a hug because i was finally feeling like, ""it's real, it's going to happen, it's going to work""
and then this stupid fuck face, is like ...""Ughhh, i don't know what i want."" WHY because he's a closted fuck face whose tired of lying to his friends and family when he's with me and he doesn't want to see me more than once a week. I understand how easy it is for people to be like, ""um, he's no good, he's an asshole, leave him"" i mean he comes over and turns on espn ( you can guess how he is) but it's like i can't. And he made me cry on the phone, and noones ever done that. and i'm giving this a week, otherwise i'm ending it, because i can't just be randomly used. EVen though he doesn't really use me because i use him.
i hate boys, forever. I want somethign to work so i can write some positive music, otherwise i will just be like amy winehouse 2  black to fag"

With a box of cereal by my bed

The smell of my house

Smashing the sheets of ice that didn't make the grass
Ballys face in the snow
Smelling all the tracks
unable to get up the stairs

The way the lamp posts look like they are carved
Out of the tries
The bridge from lord of the rings

reversing into an icy driveway
barb sherman's uggs and christmas partays!

Kicking my shoes off
The heals still down

How fast the cold air
Hits you coming out of the car

Pulling my socks off before bed

Trying to find new batteries
Annoyance, keep replacing things

My stomach growling
How frosted mini-wheats dissolve like bones in my mouth

Waking up to find my parents replaced as eels
Porch collapse with an alien ( from alien) next to me offering me food from mcdonalds, or having a demon crawl down my esophagus and grab my kidneys

I went to the laser specialist and it was the most awkward thing ever. and they were like, um it's 200 dollars, and requires 10 to 20 times, and the success rate is 50%. and i'm going to try to talk to you about stupid things to make you feel comfortable. But seeing as this is, "" a cosmetic"" procedure it's not covered by insurance, so it would be um let's say, 4000 dollars.

WHAT THE FUCK? is 4000 dollars worth this? um, i don't know. It's like one of those ""priceless commercials"" but when these things actually happen to you, you just feel bad. and i'm so tired of feeling bad, because 4000 is worth more than my braces, more than 7+ years of acne medication, or plane tickets, or food clothing and music.

"event","sometimes i really really hate new york. Well, it's actually hard for me to tell, i don't hate the city per se but i hate things about it. Maybe it's the fact that my room is so fucking small with next to know window. I've just been really angry lately about a lot of things, and 'm trying to work them through. I don't alwyas like my friends here, they're just, boring in a way. And maybe that's not true but i'm mad so i'm writing it. How about this, they are not RANDOM, and i am very random, and i need more random. SO people move here? Now? My room mate's girlfriend is my friend but i've decided i like both of them much better as single people. I hate having to 'knock' on my closet door of a room just to make sure thery're not having sex. and she's in here every night and they talk in baby faces and i want to punch them. Partly cause i've been getting lonely at night. My days are actually really well, i'm writing some amazing music and THAT whole area is finally getting solved, maybe this is everything else i repressed for the last 7 years shitting all over me. I don't know why i'm so angry, but i've been thinking about random things and i don't know if i want to live in the city anymore. I think i would do better in a nice part of brooklyn or maybe i just need more friends, i don't mean like need in a bad way, ugh, i don't know what i mean. I'm tired of staying in because noone wants to go out. I've also thought about moving to california, i don't know, it's so constricting here, but once again maybe i need to leave this fucking dorm even though it's already paid for. It's hard to hang on to people here, they are all so fucking flaky although i met some cool people this week. 
I also ran into vanessa carlton today walking her dog ( which is why new york is great). I saw her dog first which i was like ""cute"" and then she turned around and was on the phone, and i was like ""vanessa?"" and she smiled and kept walking. And i was shocked because i didn't know what do say or do so i followed her for a bit and then decided i shouldn't bother her even though i really wanted to... :( I thought about this afterwords, freshman year david and I were eating lunch and david ""knowing me so well"" talked about how i would probably buy her cd since i spent the entire lunch hour making fun of her. We talked about how she should've been hit by the truck in her video. And then i literally run into her. That's crazy, isn't it? i mean the whole story of from then to now, me running into her. I was suppossed to meet her earlier this year but my teacher ( who was hers) couldn't go to the concert so they wouldn't let me in the back.  I will say this, if i ever, EVER get approached i will never shoot someone down ( which she didn't) i would be so gratefull that someone admired me or whatever that I would throw the phone down into the subway grates ( well maybe not that). I shall remember her smile though, although i think she was freaked out because I knew her name, and then all these fuckers came and started taking pictures, and she turned and i just stood there.  Yes, i think i'm not going to live her much longer. I want to see how much i paid for this semester, because maybe what i need is a new space ( literally) i can't wait for thanksgiving, i want to go home. 
I'm also asking the boy out, tomorrow, because i can't handle it anymore"

Cause i know i can't get it back, and it won't be the same, and maybe sometimes the realizations that have come from this are worth it. But they don't always feel like it. If i was asked, ""well would you rather know this now or not have had that happened at all, lived through it without realizing?"" i don't know. I guess i feel disconnected from you guys, so sometimes from myself. I miss it more than, a lot of other things. But it's okay, cause i'm trying now. 
Also, please see into the wild. My taste in movies has gotten better, and this movie has to be seen, it's really wonderful. 
So i'm going to ask him out prob next week. I can't wait much longer, i wanted to get through some other stuff first but it's killin me now! The WAY he said, ""See you next friday."" made me want to scream "" I don't want to fucking wait!!!"" however, if i do wait, and can have a sense of freedom in sexual exploits, then it will all be worth it.

I can go in the hall or something, but i think in all honestly i'm just ready to have a single room. Well, school starts offically tomorrow, i have A+R music buisness for like 3 hours then i'm going to a gay meeting i think. Music is going really well, i have a show next week which i'm looking forward to and the honesty is coming out much faster. 
I saw Sicko the other day and liked it a lot. I don't know who does know this or not, but my dad took the UTAH job because he has a strand of hep that can be fatal. Somehow his liver managed to stand up to 40+ years of drug abuse but he has to get surgery sometime within the next 6 years. Anyways, that's why he keeps changing jobs so he can get medical insurance without telling the company. He never really told any of this until recently, but i guess the 'witch doctor' he's dating has him on some herbal regiment. Well, i don't really have to deal with it until a while, but i try to keep it in mind.

"event","So i figure i'm allowed to make some sort of judegements only because i just arrived and am naturally alone and recently moved into a new apartment that's not quite what i expected. Originally i was suppossed to just be living with isaac in a nice 2 bedroom place but because his housing got lost and i was therefore going to be living with someone else, i elected to live with him because we seem to work well together as room mates. For this to occur though, i had to live with 9 other suitemates, which actually isn't the problem. I just arrived and my room with isaac is not only smaller than my old room ( which was pretty small) but there's no window in my room. Now all the other suites have big rooms and huge windows overlooking stuff, but because we are in the corner, we don't. Frankly, i'm not okay with this. I Spend a lot of time in the room writing and I need sunlight, i need to lookout and open the window and feel the wind. SO in that regard, i'm not happy, and i need to be happy about where i'm living. It's not to say it won't work out, but i had to already move furniture out to put my keyboard in. THe space itself is huge, the suite is enormous, but we got shafted, and i don't know right now if i'm willing to live here for a year, it's prime location, but seriously, no window? oh, and the rooms also are separated by only three inches and have holes above all the doors which means everyone can hear everything you or anyone else says. And the train runs below which also sucks. ergh, i'm scared that i'm not going to deal well with this but i DO know that i have to wait and give it time to see how i feel about school, social life and music. There's another gay kid in the suite which is cool but right now i'm apprehensive and tired, i also have to get a meal plan since how the hell can i keep tract of food with 11 other people sharing it with me? I fully understand what 'sacrifice' means, and that i'm lucky to be living in new york, but i also know that it's a relative word and because i know that it might bother me the point of being depressed ( i need vitamin d) then i might have to change it.
         In other news, i feel like a lot of things at home are much better, and seriously look forward to the relationships i rebuilt and the person i will hope to become. I've realized so much about myself these past two years and know that a lot has to change. But i believe i can make those changes, most importantly being honest and standing up for myself. I'm going to see tina tomorrow so that's a positive thing and she's always my light force in these situations. Well my room is bothering me, which is a problem, but maybe it's a problem that if i speak up, can be solved."

I went to pride tonight and felt nostalgic, it wasn't the same magic there but it was such an important part of my life that i couldn't help but want to go back to the time when it was so giving. I also felt old, isn't that strange? how in the world can i feel old at 20? i often feel like i just sped past my youth and tried so hard to escape adolescence that i never really had much of one. I know that's not true because i had some amazing times with some interesting people, i just wished i would've realized the cost or the outcome of how i lived and how i saw the world. I guess it's better because i can make more positive changes right now, and i really want to, and i need to, because i don't want to literally throw myself and time out the window.

noah said on the phone that he forgot he was 20 as well and felt old, I want to laugh and i try to discover what about our society makes us feel old at 20?! is it media representation, i know part of it is that until your 21 ( and mostly if you're gay) it's incredibly hard to meet other gay people ( or those outside your town) so you rush through parts of life to discover that's it's depressingly the same everywhere AND your now ACTUALLY old which makes you  horrendous within the community. PArt of it is also my desire not to base my own life around standards of how i think 'teenage' life is SUPPOSSED to be, and then i often feel sad because it wasn't like how it's portrayed, and that you can therefore only be happy if you fit the stereotypical outline of that. I don't know if those people are more or less happy then i was. In seeing superbad, i felt bad because i couldn't identify with the characters very well, i want to say I WISH i could, or I WISH i would've because i never took risks, went to parties, did stupid things like that and therefore restricted myself and ya know what? i just really want to go to a party, i don't know why, but i want it to be like a HUGE drunk ass party, and i want to get smashed and have sex with someone in a bedroom that i've had a crush on for a long time. ( speaking of crushes, i haven't had like a butterfly teenage crush since highschool, it's different, i haven't gotten excited like that, i wonder if i will? ya know those people you meet and it's like BAM, yea not happening at the moment, gosh i want a crush). Maybe it will never happen to me ( the party thing) partly because of NYU or perhaps maybe because I CHOOSE not to, and that i can CHOOSE to do something just to see how it is. Sometimes i wish i was normal, not like 'normal straight' but normal ordinary on a day to day basis, like the goals and dreams i had were normal, i could go to a school where i live in an ACTUAL house with space, and i could be passionate about buisness or medicine or something. I often wonder what my life would be like, i often think it would be freeing in a way, cause i have this burden i've placed on myself, and i attach worth and self worth to it, like "" if i don't have a record deal by 23"" then i quit. Which i seriously might! only because i don't know if i want to live forever this way, and yes, I AM happy now, and i LOVE music and am so passionate about it. However, i often wonder if maybe i could have more stable relationships more fullfilling and lasting friendships, a REAL income and a family if i did something else. I wonder if that's what it will come down to in a few years or whatever. I know nothings gonna happen for at least the next two, i just have to stay focused. But i do know that if it comes to having a family or something WAY down the road, i (like amy winehouse) will choose family and quit because i'd rather wake up to children who i can be there for and who i can lead down different paths than the one that i feel has branded me."

sarah silverman is funny
i need more friends that are boys ( straight or gay)
i wish noah was here
i wish it was senior year and over
i wish NYU wasn't so gay in that no one talks to anyone, 

i think i want to go to london 

i sat in washington square and all these italians went into water and took off all their clothes. Everyone laughed, and this shirtless guy was skate boarding and i tried to trip him to start a conversation. But i could see a rainbow through the water and it was the best part of the day cause i did nothing but sit and enjoy the water and the breeze.

These dumb bird sounds are coming off of Emma Watson's webpage, it's stupid. I don't know why i'nm there except for that mugglenet.com said something. Did you know she was 9 when she got harry potter? THAT IS SO DUMB, MOST 9 YR OLDS CAN'T even shit in their own toilets. _ lie

I want to see that dumb movie 'becoming jane' no one else does 'usual'. But i will just because those movies are always so impossible but make you feel good, until you step outside of the theatre.

i'm 20, that is stupid

my room mate always just smashes the door open instead of knocking, 2 more nights and him his fucking friends and his dumb slut, really, like a total voyuer slut will be gone. 

I'm excited to go to utah to see my family, isn't that dumb? at least my dad will be stupid as always and my family can all laugh at him.

My sister called me to say that my brother left her an 'urgent message' and that she couldn't talk to him. I was scared that bally was dead, i almost had a nervous breakdown, i would've come home immediately. She didn't die, ( thank god) when she does, believe me the world will know. Silent confidence's are the best friends in the world, even though she can't get up the stairs or anything.

what is this oxy cotin stuff? My suite mates always do it, and it's so fucking stupid, it's like from an inhaler?

I miss people from pride, i need a gay community ehre, i'm going to the glbt center on tuesday for a group called 20 somethings, because even though i'm gay, i'm so uncomfortable with certain aspects of myself i shit 7 times a day.

My next job needs to have like other kids around, because currently it encompasses me putting graphics on a computer, i mean what fucking new york professional doesn't know how to open a jpeg file? they always say ""good work"" and i laugh, because i take a long time to take their money.

If my dad doesn't take the money i made this summer, i'm enrolling in the drama school uptown for evening classes since my nyu education is like over. I think junior year might be my last, why am i in school?  then again, ""what the fuck would i do outside of school?""

I wish i could have spontaneous sex with someone, and feel free. but i can't. I always have to be dumb and talk to them, and make everything WAIT. I think i'm just going to have sex with someone back home, because well, we should. and that's a gay thing to do, and i could learn all about it. 

My dumb ex, was dumb. He would cum like 2 times every time we did anything and then give up on me, the entire time i think i came once and it was the first night, then he gave up on me and was tired, unless of course i opted to do anything to him. he was good at first but then only liked me because i was there, and then he wouldn't talk to me.

i want to fall in love like everyone else, like that DUMB kind where it's like over a year and even though it sucks and hurts you can say you did it. I need to work on that because i don't let peoeple inside of me. NOT LIKE THAT. i mean like, emotionally who am I? and where did I go>
when i turn 21 i'm going to go crazy. Although december 9th i booked a show at the bitter end. That will be the end of it all! FINALLY EVEN THOUGH IT""S ONLY 15 minutes, isn't that GAY?? well it's a showcase so it can only be that. Although i will add video to my myspace.com/nickydeutsch and more people will visit my new songs. Actually i'm happy with them, i'm getting closer to the sound i want. 1,169 visits or something, that's just because i friend all the fags cause

My extended family is too scared to ask me about homo sex even though they ask my sister and my brother, and i feel left out, and i want to be included but i;m too scared to say anything. I think i need to grow balls
saturday nigh ti'm getting drunk and i'm going to scream and smash things.

I'm like perezhilton.com britney spears, she is so FUCKING CRAZY? what happened to her? at least xtina is still hot, maybe when i'm on the 99 aids deathbed she will come to my make a wish foundation, and i'll be like bitch, give me your voice, also i wish you would stop staring at me from above my bed cause it makes me feel like i should try.

I never really was able to stand up, i just get angry and then at no one. And the anger sits inside me like the whore in union square waiting for someone to pay.  Urerg, i'm never rooming with someone i don't know ever again, unless their gay, just because this is now horrible, and i lack ability to defend myself because i'm afraid of something, perhaps that i may in fact win? i don't know, i wish i hadn't read harry potter so i could read it again and feel some sort of identification with harry potter.

I'm almost done with the cd and next week i get to meet vanessa carlton, so it's awesome. I'm working with the new york songwriter's circle as the director's assistant and it's great. I got to meet the two heads of the largest independent record label and music publisher in new york, beautiful 5th ave apartments!

anyways, i really don't want to be single again, I REALLY DON'T. although i feel it happening, the dread is coming! we didn't talk today so i'm kinda scared. I think he doesn't really like me for me, more like he likes me because i'm there. Maybe it's the age gap, or the fact that i don't look as hot as him or the abercrombie model staring at me from his bedside wall. It's like he doesn't want my affection though, it's strange. I hadn't seen him for like 4 days and he comes back and won't let me kiss him. argh, it's frustating since we've been going out for over a month and sometimes we work well and sometimes he won't talk to me for long stretches of time. I think maybe he's just too normal for me, there's not enough like creative force behind his finance job and general lack of enthusiam for passion. I mean sometimes when he smiles it's amazing, but the opposite end is like the worse feeling ever. I'd rather feel alone by myself than alone in his bed with him next to me unable to to conjure up any romantic feeling besides, ""wow you're dry humping me"" and then....nothing...repeatedly. I guess i shouldn't complain, everyone tells me how good-looking he is, and yes, he is, and yes he's hot, but he like doesnt' let me see underneath it, and it's stupid anyway. I don't care if you have huge pecs if there's nothing underneath. 

                I liked harry potter, and soichiro facebooked me, so that is...comical.
also, jesus camp made me realize how many things i hate. or rather, it illuminated how angry i haven't been in years."

I've grown a lot the past couple weeks and learned a LOT about myself. Being in a relationship for the first time has been exciting and incredibly challenging. Letting myself get comfortable with someone has been really tough. At times i've felt bad, and MADE to feel bad about the fact that i've been taking things slow but i figure it's ok. I kinda am wondering if it's possible that i'm not feeling a sexual connection. I mean, i spent 20 years in repression, you'd think i would be exploding from the seams, instead i'm kinda bored and like....bleh, that feels....wait...i don't feel anything......I've had to really challenge myself emotionally and yes, i, slutty, have had to take off my clothes which has been...interesting. There's so much conflicting emotion, especially since he;s leaving in like 2 weeks for a year and a half. Sometimes i feel guilty but i don't know if it's for the right reasons. I feel like a have to pleasure him, but not because i WANT to, but because i'm afraid he'll get mad or be upset with me since he kinda was the first time. He treats me wonderfully and really cares about me as i do him. But i'm kinda feelin shaky over the cast couple nights we've been together. I mean, i felt like sick and dirty, which i think IS NOT a good sign. i won't go into detail to spare any uncomfortable thoughts but it's kinda scaring me. Shouldn't i want to be doing this?

( although i guess i always come to that conclusion after months of work). Needless to say my new music will have a band behind it for myspace, which is pretty exciting. The music is going great, i'm amazed that my homework is to record drum loops and great stuff although it worries me that job applications ask for resumes. My talents? um, slutting?

I've also been seeing someone for a little bit, but it's going great. He has my name. We met and for the first time, it wasn't sketchy. He hates gay people, so it's all good right? OH, and he's leaving for switzerland in the summer and then africa next year, so i guess i never get to see him again. He treats me really great. A lot of respect, i guess i didn't really know how it was suppossed to be. 
i'll update if exciting things happen, i suppose new music will be up in a month or two, once school ends."

I love gallatin, it's really great. I'm taking two recording classes, a 3 hour poetry and prose course, theory four, and acting in tisch. I somehow managed to get into the acting class, and it's really enjoyable! Haley joel osment is in the class next door and i can see him watching ghosts through the walls. My cd is also doing great and i still get myspace listenings which constantly amazes me! I got a show at the lions den feb 21st for 45 minutes which is also great ( REBECCA CHU WANT TO COME?) i will also be playing the bitter end at the end of the year!!!!! i can't believe how great everything is going!  To top it off, i've begun the process of seeing a 24 yr old medical nyu student whose biceps are as big as my thighs. I'm not sure why he likes me, but i'm not complaining..."

so, i can't go to berklee until next fall ( if i choose to) i'm suppossed to register for classes tomorrow but since nyu has neglected to tell me what program i'm in, i'm basically shut out of everything. I feel like my life no longer has a purpose and i'm going to fall into a hole bigger than the biggest black hole ever created."

"event","basically, i'm at an extremely annoying place in my life, and i really have no idea what to do. It's clear that my current program at nyu is not working, because i'm obviously not happy, my grades are bad and my motivation is like negative 7. I need some sort of change, but the fucking registration office won't tell me when or if i get into this new program. 
There's also berklee which now i'm considering transfering to, but which is also incredibly annoying to even think about. I really dont want to move, but i will visit the school before xmas break so i can come to some clearer decesions on my life. I feel that nyu is a wonderful academic program but that i'm just not that kid. I really wish that i was, i wish i could be content studying educational things and have a focus that was like ' english literature' or 'gym manager' or acting or something. I just feel fucked, and i'm unhappy and i hate feeling like this. At least i have options, and i'm talking to tina tomorrow so hopefully she has some good advice and maybe she can just sign me or something. I'm taking next year off, i feel like taking the rest of this year off to figure out myself. ARHAJHRJAHRJAHRJHAJHRJHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH


let me tell you, being content with a reasonable goal and making a difference in the world is better than a fucking dream"

"event","so i had my first encounter with a crazy new yorker the other day.
noah and i were at tla video and for a second we looked at the lgbt movies. This drunk 40 yr old (i think mexican) guy appeared from nowhere and asked me to find halloween for him. I tried to find it but i couldn't and i told him repeatedly to go up to the front and ask for it. Then he said, "" you look real good man, real good"" "" will you go out with me?"" and i was like


uahsuahsuahuahuah, I don't know you? and I'm already dating someone?

then he got really aggresive and started screaming, "" it's cause i'm ugly right, it's cause i'm ugly?"" and my response was "" i don't make those judgements"" ( can you believe i said that?"" that he started running towards me and noah grabbed my arm and we ran to the front of the store, the guy lingered for a while and then left. 

I almost shit my pants it was so fucking scary..

we watched lady vengenace tho, and it was good. DAVID MORTAL KOMBAT ARMEGG is OUT!!!!!!!!!!

also, because of this, and lucas, i hate all men everywhere for the rest of my life"

We went into the open porch and the sign said ""take one please"" and then david and i looked at each other, and then just stole all the candy. It was the best moment ever. fin

Even though i actually failed some stuff, it's ok because i'm just withdrawing from the classes. I put my application for gallatin in, so hopefully i can focus more on writing. I had a really good composition lesson and my teacher believes in me, so as long as i hold fast to why i'm here, i should be ok. I'm just taking it a day at a time, after next semester i will decide whether or not i'll be in this program, gallatin or possibly switch to gender and sexualities"

"event","basically, i'm having a real difficult time with everything right now. 
for the first time in a while, i'm serisouly considering quitting music for good. I really just kinda hate everything about it. I hate the music buisness, i hate marketing, i'm just mad and angry. Mad at myself, i regret like the last 4 years of my life, I mean I don't ""hate"" them, i'm just really upset with everything. I've never put so much emphasis into something to feel like i've failed. I wake up, and don't feel like playing, i feel like i just keep getting older, and everything stays the same. Part of the problem is this fucking program. I don't know what i should do, or what i want to do. It's like i had an addiction problem, seriously, i mean i played 8 hours a day over the summer and i feel no better about anything. I feel like maybe, it's not meant to be. And i had this dream to get me through highschool more like to ""avoid"" dealing with anything that was going on in my life, and now i threw it all away. I don't want a pity party or misery or anything. I went out to dinner with noah the other weekend and he was like, ""i think you should get help"". I'm not sure what course of action i should take. I feel like maybe my journey was more a search for some kind of greater acceptance or love than an actual search for fame or anything. I'm just so tired of starting over, again and again. At least when i was acting, i spent a lot of time doing it, and i was ok, I didn't even have formal training and i was OK. If i don't get into gallatin for the spring, i'm staying home.  I think i'll do a leave of abscence and try to study at piven or something, and maybe i could come back to nyu next year for acting or something. I just feel like i'm at the end of my rope with this, and it's not even the music, it's something else. I feel like it's just ""everything"", because to me it is/was ""everything"". I don't know who i am beyong this point in my life, and i really dreamt so hard and now it's like i don't care. I just want to like have a family or something. Even if i found success in the music industry i would most likely spend e849384938 years traveling alone, I think i do have genuinely good things to say lyrically and musically, but for the amount of time i've spent on this, i mean i should be a fucking virtuoso. I'm not comparing myself to other people, as much as i can spend 8 hrs doing something, and some freshamn can spend 2 hours a day and be great. I just start hating everything, hating the prospect of getting jobs and gigs, where my music wouldn't be mainstream because it wouldn't be marketable, and i'm afriad i'm just going to end up that old lonely bitter gay anorexic man. I really do, people are always like, ""no don't worry, he'll come along, or you'll find someone some day"" But i don't think so.  I think being gay is just stupid, and i have to find a medium of work where i can express myself, communicate with people on a greater level, be happy, and GET BETTER. I'm scared of trying to finish this semester, really i'm not sure if i can stand this for 2 more months. and i can't exactly take a leave of absence, go home and figure myself out.

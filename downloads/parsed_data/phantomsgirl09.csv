"event","SPRING BREAK!!!!!  YES-IT'S HERE LADIES, FINALLY!!!!  Now, what to do, what to do...oh I know, how about sleepover at my house Wednesday night!  Yeah, I can't wait.  So my bed and the rest of my room is set up and everything is beautiful and I love it!  I really want you ladies to see it!  But until then I am rather bored.  I am going to take my permit test Friday-I'm pretty nervous.  I went shopping today and got a couple shirts from Hollister and that was pretty much it.  So how was your St. Paddy's Day?  mine was pretty good, the only thing was that everybody that I was around didn't really get into it like I did.  Nobody wanted to watch the Boondock Saints except for me and Jarrod, so we just went in the back bedroom at my Grandma's and watched it and laughed a lot b/c it is a wonderful movie.  Then me and my mom went to Wal-Mart at like twelve to two in the morning and there was nobody there so I turned up my goofy notch even more than it already was and I was just like ""la-too-la-roo-la-roo-la"" the entire time singing the Irish lulaby...good times.  Well, ladies I hope to see you Wednesday and I'm sure I'll talk to you before then, but, yeah, anyways...BYE!!!!!!"

So me and my mom went to the Mills today-and saw Allie in Deb-that was cool.  I got a dress-I guess I like it, my mom says it looks really good on me and Trent even said he likes it-so I guess that's good.  What is this Bebo thing?-I'm not sure but I am now on it.  So I was talking to Trent, asking him who he thought I should ask to escort me (options:  Joey, Jody, and John) and he said John was too short, he would kill me if I picked Joey and would never speak to me again, and said to pick Jody, because he thinks he's pretty cool and likes him.  So yeah-what do you ladies think-I want your honest opinions-PLEASE!!!!!!!  THANKS!!!  I LOVE YOU LADIES-I have to go now, but hope to see you ladies soon-CONGRATS on winning your game Leah and Allie-I hope you had good luck finding a dress-BYE!!!!!"

"event","what direction south is?  Another one of my favorite songs.  I really want to go to the play Friday.  Leah-you need to hear the truth-I'm sorry I want to go to the football game its just that if Amber goes with you I think I will lose it.  I know she will be all over you and frankly she gets on my nerves and I wouldn't have much fun.  You needed to know.  I love you but she is just nuts about you(in the crazy and obsessed way).  And it would be loads of fun to spend the night with Allie-the one that pushes me into the lockers-lol!  Well I am going to go-I will talk to you ladies later-BYE!"

Today is Halloween and I am going to pig out on candy.  I have practice all week except for Friday.  Sammy Jo hopes she doesn't get as fat as me.  Well I am going to go-BYE!"

"event","are when I'm alone with you.  Sorry this is a good song(The Best of Times by Styx).  Why.  Why.  Why.  Can nobdy be happy?  I watch all of these 'romantic' movies but they all seem to end bad.  They never end up together.  I just get soooo pissed off at these 'romantic' movies that always end bad!  I want to cry sometimes because it makes me so mad and they try sooo hard to be together but whatever they do nothing works.  They might say 'Oh you'll always be in my heart'-but you know what that's not good enough for me!  They need to be together and if they're not then they probably didn't fight hard enough to be together!  I want my life to happy and I want to fall in love and live happily ever after!  And I know that only I can make my life happy or sad its just that I don't know..........Just don't ask-I'm losing it.  I just want to be happy and right now I am not that happy-I'm confused and stressed and I don't know.  I hate this feeling.  I always try to be happy; I don't know what is wrong with me.  I am out of here.  One of you ladies please write me back.  I really need to talk to someone.  I do believe that I am havng a nervous break down.  Lately I have really been worrying about my back and how it is hurting a lot more and if I will be able to do cheerleading or anything else in the near future.  I just really need one of you guys to write me back please!!!!  You could also call me-right now my mom and dad are at a meeting for my subdivision and the boys are at my Grandma's, so I am home alone.  Please-I need answers PRONTO!!!!!!!  Well right now I am going to go pray and try to relax-I think I am just having some kind of 'spell' kind of like hot flashes but in a totally different meaning.  Good-Bye!"

I bought the very first ""The Phantom of the Opera"" for a dollar this weekend.  It is weird-there are a lot of similarities and differences.  And I now know his name-Erik!  Everyone else has cool and unusual names and then theres Erik.  I was a bit disappointed.  But its all good.  Well ladies I have homework so I have to go-Bu-Bye!"

My brother was talking to me in French and was saying ""You know if somebody came to our school today they would think WOW these are a bunch of hicks-they even let them wear their cowboy hats.  After school we redecorated the hallway-it is much better, at least it is our school colors.  The only problem was that we couldn't tape anything to the drywall, because the paint will come off.  Like they care they just repaint it every year anyways.  Well I am going to bed-Later!"

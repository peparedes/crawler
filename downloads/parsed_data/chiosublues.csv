Rape is not funny, never will be, It was not her fault, she was not asking for it. For those that says things like this, you need to stop and think. Clothing is not consent, nor is inebriation. If she didn't say yes, KEEP IT IN YOU FUCKING PANTS."

"event","Chiosu Blues: The Owner's Guide and Maintenance Manual
Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a fully-automated C.T. BLUES unit. To ensure that you get the full use and benefits of your chaos sowing cyclone and Mobile Suit/Personal Trooper/Super Robot Pilot, please pay close attention to the following instructions:
-
Basic Information-Name: Chiosu Tadayoi Blues(C.T. Blues, Rouzeki Tadayoi, Black Cyclone, Shady Negro, that Damned Rabbit, Schrodinger's Negro.)
Date of Manufacture: 02/22/????
Place of Manufacture: Earth, Alabama
Genetic Type: Natural/African Origin
Height: 172.7 cm (Not as tall as he'd like to be.)
Weight: Fairly Light
 
-
Your C.T. Blues unit will come with the following accessories:
Two (2) Costumes
Ten (10) Swords of various quality and origin
One (1) Street-Thug Sports gear outfit.(For hiding out in housing projects)
Twenty (25) Gigabytes[GB] of various anime and video game soundtracks.
 
-
Please take note that the ????? Unit is not included with C.T. Blues. In order to obtain one, assist the Blues unit in attempting to date one. Be careful, as we are not responsible for any damage to your C.T. Blues unit.
 
-
Programming:
-
The C.T. Blues unit is one of the most versatile and flexible units around. He will willingly serve in as many different modes as possible. He is one of the friendliest units around, and is willing to help you out (as long as you're on the right side). If you have any trouble to get him to obey you, challenge his ego a bit, or threaten his friends, er, comrades, whichever you find easier to do.
COMEDIAN: The C.T. BLUES unit usually has a laid-back attitude, and comes with a built-in sense of humor and sarcasm. You can hire him out to anyone who needs a good laugh. His jokes may not always be appreciated, but hey, they've already paid you.
SURPRISE WEAPON: Need to find your way out of a tight spot? The C.T. Blues unit is excellent at coming up with a plan in a short space of time. Just give him five minutes, and watch as he bails you out.
MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER: Do your other units need some motivating? Or maybe you or someone you know needs some encouragement. The C.T. BLUES unit will be happy to give anyone a push in the right direction or a pat on the back.
SCAVENGER: Hungry, in need of immediate food and water but don't know where to get it? Well worry no more! The C.T. BLUES unit is great at finding supplies at a moment's notice, as long as you don't mind taking stuff from abandoned places like abandoned ships or colonies. Or his bitching about using his own paycheck on it.
BODYGUARD: Feeling threatened? This unit is moderately trained in combat, both with a handgun and a variety of melee weapons. His aim may not be the most accurate, but at least he knows how to use a gun, and can threaten your enemies with it.
RADAR: Wanna find a Bella/Luna unit but don't know where to look? The C.T. BLUES has a built-in radar made specifically to locate this unit. Bribe or blackmail him first, as he's not too fond of the B/L units, and watch as he leads you to the nearest B/L unit. (We're not responsible for any damages due to confrontation with the B/L Unit.)
 
-
Your C.T. Blues has five (5) different settings:
-
Gaming (Default Setting)
Laid-back and Amused
Sarcastic and/or Cynical(Default Workday setting)
Angry
Schrodinger's Negro. (Locked)
Unit is usually in Laid-back and Amused or Gaming modes. When a situation comes up, depending on the situation, unit will go into either Sarcastic/Cynical mode (in which he may be rude and/or blunt, and we will not be held responsible for any resulting damage), or Serious mode. During conflict, unit is usually in Angry mode (again, we are not responsible for any personal or property damage). The 'Schrodinger's Negro' mode is only activated after harm is done to a ??? unit, three failed dates in three consecutive encounters, or more than the passage of seven(7) months without intercourse.
 
-
Relations with other units:
-
Your C.T. BLUES unit is not the most tactful of units, so he may offend some people. However, after some time and getting used to, he gets along with most units.
BELLA/LUNA: WARNING: encounters with this unit must always be with approached with caution and/or prevented from occurring. However, when blades start flying, we suggest you hightail it out of there, unless you want to get hurt. Don't worry, the C.T. BLUES unit can take care of himself. But if you are still worried, we suggest sending the RAT-PACK units in for backup. Watch the Blues unit carefully, as he may seek her out in moments of EXTREME BOREDOM. Keep him occupied.
-
Other unit interactions:
-
 
-
Cleaning:
The C.T. BLUES is more than capable of cleaning himself. However, if you insist on cleaning him yourself, please remember the following: do not machine-wash; towel-dry only, do not tumble dry. Unit may be dry-cleaned.
 
-Energy:
Your C.T. BLUES unit needs lots of food to give him energy. Feed him thrice daily, with moderate portions.
 
-Frequently Asked
Questions:
-
Q: Woah, the model I received looks a lot like Blues, I mean, he's got the black hair and same features, but he's got this scar across his nose, his hair is far too curly , and he comes with several large caliber pistols. He's not nice at all, and he refuses to answer by his name, claiming he has no idea who 'Blues' is! What's going on!
A: Oops. We seem to have sent you the wrong version. That's the 'AU Cyclone'. Unfortunately, during development, we accidentally glitched him and he gained a second set of programming. As a result, we had to overlay both programs. You can keep him if you like (he'll eventually remember his old programming, with some time and appropriate prodding), but if you can't wait and want the correct version, just send it back and we'll ship the right one to you.
 
Q: Oh no! I lost my C.T. BLUES unit! He had to go due to unforeseen circumstances. I want him back! What should I do?
A: Don't worry, the C.T. BLUES unit is equipped with a state-of-the-art homing device. He's like a boomerang, he'll find his way back to you (provided he liked you in the first place). No matter how impossible the situation seems, he'll make it possible.
 
-
Troubleshooting:
Problem: Your C.T. BLUES unit isn't laughing ,joking, or gaming like he used to. Instead, he looks troubled and is brooding quite a lot. You're starting to get worried.
Solution : Assure him gently. If that doesn't work, get a ??? unit and let her keep him company. Better yet, just get the ??? unit, now!
 
Problem: Your C.T. Blues unit just threw himself into the path of danger, taking the blow meant for you. Now he disappeared in a flash of light, and you're devastated. Or, you're angry and want your money back.
Solution: Sorry, we don't take refunds. But have patience. Wait a couple of years, and he'll come back to you (he always does).
-
With proper care and maintenance, your C.T. BLUES unit will lead a long and happy life.

Bound and restricted
I tried to give you up

Point being, mockingbirds don't give a damn about when they sing or what they sing, and I like that."

"event","There's a guy that sits in the front row during physics class, and he sounds like Tom Cruise. I mentioned this aloud and the guy in front of me seemed to agree. I was inspired to bring up this devastatingly insightful observation after he began answering one of the demo guy's questions with ""I believe it's because..."" which just sounded really weird.

I laughed a little, just because our physics class is just about as casual you can get with people leaving during the lecture, Moore making unnervingly suggestive comments, and it seems out of place to have a passable voice actor for Tom Cruise answering a question so formally."

"event","I got my physics lab report back today, and it was a 92. The TA said the average, however, was a 71 plus or minus some huge standard deviation. I then found out I could've made a 102 if I hadn't made a ""wrong"" conclusion about one of my data sets (despite the fact that it's what the data supported); I lost ten points there.

Absoludicrous!

"event","What the hell is the point of all this physics homework if the people who create/assign it can't be bothered to make sure it matches with what we're learning in class? Okay, say you say ""Somebody screwed up,"" but the longer you people go on without correcting the problem is screwing US over. Our latest homework assignment has two questions dealing with material four chapters ahead of where we are, and requires an ultra-specialized equation of which will be no practical use for another question. I guess this isn't so bad because everything else seems to be reasonable material, but most of it is still looking up equations and using them.

Also, aren't TAs supposed to, or at least strongly, strongly encouraged to attend their professor's lectures? You'd think this would give said TA a better idea of where the class is and what students could use help with, but every Thursday night from 7 - 8 PM looks like it's going to be an exercise in pain. Time slows down; nobody knows what's going on; and you can read the anger and apathy on people's faces as they sit there and silently ask, ""How is this remotely useful to me?"" It's also stupid (that's too kind of a word) that the TA can't go over (because he's unable to, forbidden from, or doesn't want to) the homework.

'Stupid' is too kind of a word. Come on, it's assigned three times a week, we start losing points on it three days after its assigned, and you're telling us <i>you're not allowed to help us with it?</i> What the hell are you there for? It's a bad sign when the TA asks us ""So what did you guys go over in class?"" and writes things on the board straight from the book. There's just so many things wrong with the TA session for this class, and for some reason it's hard to explain all the things that are wrong about it."

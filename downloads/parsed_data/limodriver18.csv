"event","There were two brothers. One was very good and tried to always live right and be helpful. His brother, on the other hand, was bad and did all the things that men should not do and didn't care who he hurt.  
 
The bad brother died. He was still missed by his brother since he loved him despite his ways.  
 
Finally, years later, the good brother died and went to Heaven.  
 
Everything was beautiful and wonderful there and he was very happy.  
 
One day he asked God where his brother was, as he hadn't seen him there. God said that he was sorry but his brother lived a terrible life and went to Hell instead.  
 
The good brother then asked God if there was any way for him to see his brother. So God gave him the power of vision to see into Hell and there was his brother. He was sitting on a bench with a keg of beer under one arm and a gorgeous blonde on the other.  
 
Confused, the good brother said to God, ""I am so happy that you let me into Heaven with You. It is so beautiful here and I love it. But I don't understand, if my brother was bad enough to go to Hell, why does he have the keg of beer and a gorgeous blonde. It hardly seems like punishment"".  
 
God said unto him, ""Things are not always as they seem, my son. The keg has a hole in it; the blonde doesn't.""

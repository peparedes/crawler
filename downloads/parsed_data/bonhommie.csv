'ello~ ^^ For whatever reason you've seemed to have stumbled upon my personal journal. All of my entries are friends-locked, meaning if you wish to read them, you need to be added as my friend. If you want to be my friend..well...LET YOURSELF BE KNOWN. Comment on this entry. Don't randomly add me without saying anything; I'll just ignore it. The only thing I ask is that we at least have something in common, and you care get to know me. I don't add people to just gain another number and have them lurk all over the place D:

If you're looking to post feedback on stuff you've bought from me, please do so at my sales journal <lj user=""mango_shop"">"

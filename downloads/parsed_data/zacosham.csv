"event","This morning my sister flipped her car approximately 6 times, after that it took approximately two hours before she arrived at the hospital and my parents had been notifedl.
At this point once she arrived at the hospital is where I started freaking out in the LS and finally logged.   By this time they were moving her 250 miles to the little rock hospital.  

To make a long story short, we sat for approximately six hours while they conducted neuro surgery.  She had bone fragments logged in her brain, but luckily all were removed with zero internal bleeding.  Anyways, I'll be staying here so can only get back on at nights when I get to my hotel room. 

So far she is stable, but seeing as this is exactly how my other sister died we are all a bit upset.  Anyways keep us in your prayers and I'll see you guys when I am able."

"event","Well, I got lost for a long time >.> <.< Lets make a update lol

My last post ... was like um a half a year ago >.> <.<

Anyways without further ado 

Lets see here, um I got fired by Dr Gamble.  Something about me saying ""Yeah most of the games  I found that look like what you want, are not anyhting close to what we are trying to do here""  ""I dont care do them anyways""  ""But they are wrong""  ""Dont argue do them""

So yeah, I write up the report about these 10-20 year old games (young teen to adult) that arent really war related.  I said ""there are kid games in here, they match but arent in the scope""  ""Well, we need games""

So yeah she submits it all, after my protest, and gets yelled at so instead she blames me, and ""seperates"" from me.  Which is cool

So what happens when your graduate advisor quits mid ... graduate thesis?  Thats a good question, lol luckily Dr Gamble took it easy on me, or the fact I called the Graduate office and lodged an offical protest, not sure which but hey, this is what I got out of the deal

I wrote approximately 80 pages worth of shit for RQ over the course of the May->January term with her, which translate to more work then most thesis's so the school just gave me credit for a report >:D  IE I get a Masters without actually having to write a paper >.>;  Oh it gets better, since the graduate school didnt really ever ... um have this happen I got reassigned to Dr Diaz!  Yeah >:D it rocks.  My indepenedant study with him was reading about nano robots and after reading a few dozen pages ... I didnt have to .... Um do anything for it >.> <.< ::laughs evilly::

So my classes, I took 3 classes, my Indep Study With Diaz, A mangement engineering class (it rocked, I got a 100%) and a Robotics class with Diaz.

So robotics was awesome, we had to design implement and then maintain a robot for two local high schools to compete in the US First robotics challenge, I got assigned as lead programmer.  So we built this creature, and they gave me 36 hours to write software (and autonomous code as well) for a 120 lbs robot that had 37 moving parts.... it was alot of fun  I managed to make it shoot a nerf ball through a hop located random on the field autonmously ... So in competition we didnt do terrible 3rd place at the very end, and then the other team got 30th or so >.> 

What else ::thinks:: Oh I got a new job for the summer I work for Helmirich and Payne, a large oil company in Tulsa.  Im a satelite intern which means im on the satelite network team and im getting to write some software for them.  Kind of exciting, the pays pretty good, the hours sadly are 40/week but the reward is I get to play with about 25M worth of equipment as well as dick around with a pretty roboust satelite network.  Ive already done my training last week and start work for real tommrow.  I hope to be able to take out of this a better understand of satelite technology, and they might fly me around the US (and world) if a satelite breaks and im the only person around.  That would be cool, but also stressful.  

I havent talk to many people much, missing most of the people that read this.  Got sidetracked last time you guys were in town, and have been pretty busy recently.  I spent

March 9th-12th in California for spring break it was a blast.  Sadly Leo and Val were both busy, but I managed to have a killer time anyways.

Then I got a week home 

Then the last week of the month I spent 4 days in Houston for the robotics competition, another blast.  But jesus fuck Everyone who went cannot drive, I almost died at least 11 times in a car accident.  By the end my nerves were lboody shoot to fuck.  We almost either head on, broad sided, or got cut off enough times that I was glad I flew there in the end or I wouldnt have made it ... people just dont understand a fear of cars ... 

Then I was home for another 5 days
 
and then ....

The wedding.  (No not mine thank god!) So we all remember Patty  the only um ... girl I ever liked well I went to her wedding cause she finally decided and accepte dto get married to that scum bag of a boyfriend she had.

So this time it was Jami and myself going ot Minne fucking Sota.  Oi it was ... well Minnesota.

Left on a thursday morning bright and early, got there by noon.  Get off the plane, I knew so far the trip had been well, I made the airline reservations jami the hotel and car.  Nothing ever goes off without a hitch, so we get to the rental car counter ... they dont take Arvest cards.  They take bank cards and visas, but just not Arvests.  What does one do with only an Arvest card at someplace they dont take them?  Well we tried to use my card, but im not 25.  Sadly ... thats an extra 25 per day on the fees, + insurance + other bs taxes cause im not 25.  So the total cost ot use my card +150 dollars or so -.- for a bloody 3 day trip utter BS.  So we finally get them to accept a cash deposit.  The ATM is out of cash.  Were in the fucking minesota international airport and the atms there ... dont ahve cash.  Ugh, so I do a quick scape of all the shit in my bag and find 125 dollars (I had 100 luckily I had stuck a twenty in my pants a few days before >.>) anyways, so we get the car.  Now as anyone who has never been there, in minnesota they dont use road signs... apparently they arent needed in the snow or something.  So after being totally lost we find what we hope is our hotel.  Its right next to the mall of america.  So we go in, ""We dont have your reservations on file"" ... wtf? ""It might be possible your at another Marriot, let us call"" so 4 marriots later we find us... we were 2 miles west of our marriot... there were 4 within 2 miles ... im not kidding.  So we get in the room, finally its been 5 hours since I landed and we were only 2 miles from the airport .... -.0

The mall of america, was a bloody spectaular sight, it had a FULL amusement park in it, 2 roller coasters + about 30 rides.  There was 8 MILES of mall, o.o  it was so big there were sometimes two of a store, such as two Old Navies .. lol.  There was over 120 places to eat, and over 250 stores total... this baby was massive.  It took us roughtly 4 hours of hard core walking to just see it all There was a few museums attached, but man it was a beautful sight.  

So yeah, the mall was fun, what did I come to this state for?  Oh right a wedding... on with the story

So alot of boring stuff, some more boring stuff, the night before of the wedding!
So we get some olive garden (they have ToGO! its wonderful) and we go see patty, now I havent seen patty since she was in oklahoma almost a year ago.  She was gonna break up with scum bag and move home, but instead ... he proposed at hte last minute when she was packing her shit -.-;;
So it was a blast, we drove like 2 hours to spend 45 min with her before she had to goto sleep -.- (lame).  Then 2 hours going home, 6 hours of slepe then BACK to the wedding!
So shammie dresses up in his finest .. (well its minnesota I definately won best dressed guy ... sorta) I was impressed, her dress amazing, it was a very nice dress, her brides maids definatly not A+ but shagable.  She had a Tiara FFS it was what we thought a fancy wedding, so the limo (a double stretch ... could seat up to 20) pulls up to get her and the brides maids... (wow this baby gonna be a big wedding) we driving, we turn onto a dirt road ... WTF I say to jami trying to keep up with the limo thats doing 70 down a dirt road.  We pull up to ... a Church that seats maybe 30 -.-
Jami looks at me, I look at her, we just flew 1400 miles and are at a wedding thats in a church as big as my apartment ... 
So um we make the best of this shit I suppose.  Here I am the same hair color as her, so I easily pass off as her brother so I get all the access, the preacher is nice, the (120) people from his family didnt know who I was but were moderatley nice (I had a hard time telling them apart ... all 120 people all looked the same from mothers fathers kids... the same 100%) so Patty is nervous, and she introduces me to someone ""Kyle, this is Kylie, Kylie this is Kyle"" he shakes my hand, I get a funny look in his eye ""He's gay"" she whispered in my ear ... SHAAAA WING!!!   He wasnt hot hot, but definately not a bad catch.  She leans over again ""Rumor has it he is a divine dancer"" (hey wasnt that from a movie?)  so at least this wedding in the cow pasture, eeerrr church, isnt gonna be 100% lame.  So then ... I see ... the groom.  Never in my life (ok thats a lie) has my blood presure went from calm to 100% pissed off whers my bloody gun, except now.  I had a hard time picking him out, he looks like his dad, uncle, brothers, cousins, sister ... yeah ... but I Found him, I was seated in the bride side, (incidentally the church sat maybe 60 max and 50 people were from his side of the family) so that left, jami, me, her mother, father, step dad, step mother, brother and his wife, and her niece and nephew.  So it was a nice wedding (and short, after watching wedding crashers I knew exaclty what bible verses they were going to use) and I had to sing ... (wtf this isnt choir) so they do their crap, boring I say it was so .. ugh painful I wanted ot jump up and protest and kill him! but alas, I was well behaved. 

So feck glad thats over they are leaving now, the procession leaves blah blah boring stuff, whats this they are coming back in ... wait a second they are at the front.  Little did I know, in the north the bride and groom escort everyone out of hte wedding and you must touch both of them to get to leave.  Now I was in a dire straight, Jami and I hated this fucker, and im required by tradition to shake his hand, no fucking wonder patty didnt tell me, I wouldnt have gone.  (Btw, he didnt think we were going to come when he said she could invite us!!!!) So it comes to our aisle, he hugs jami (wtf he hates her more then me) then he shakes my hand, I give the corgial squeeze then patty moves to hug me, he looks over (I didnt touch anything ... ...) anyways I whisper ""Next time warn me about this crazy shit"" she kicked me -.-;

So next comes the dinner party, so they were rocking in the limo (I swear it was sex) the whole way to the dinner party, in the north weddings are catered and then you have a dance (I learn new stuff daily) So the food, was amazingly good for catering.  I had seconds the chicken was tasty.  So the dance, in the north the dances actually follow a very VERY strict pattern as follows

Bride and Groom dance (duh) he sang to her -.-;  
Bride and Father dance 
Groom and mother dance
Chicken Dance
Congo line dance
Bride dances with Best man Groom with Maid of honor.

Ok, so we all have to watch these dances ... boring boring what the hell is this Patty is coming to get me.  She had me dance with her ... instead of the best man (brads brother) it was a close dance, I had her put my hand where she was comfortable, we danced, I could feel the eyes gazing but I didnt care, patty at this point was drunk and having a good time, and didnt give a fuck what her groom said.  His blood was boiling jami could see it from our seats, anyways it was a nice dance, we had a good time we laughed, then after, is the pay dance, you pay 1 dollar to dance with either of them, this is I dunno why but part of the tradition.  Anyways, so I didnt have any cash nor did jami and we had a 2 hour drive back to the hotel.  But I did get to catch Kylie dance ... *DAMN* I was a good shammie look but no touch!  Anyways it was a blast, so patty was in the dollar dance, and we were walking out and bradley caught us on the way out ""Hey can you get patty were leaving"" jami asked him, he sceamed at her ... screamed for her to tell us goodbye and he stormed off.  Now admitedly they coulda kicked our ass, but I dont gues tradition allowed that cause the grooms men left us alone as patty said her goodbyes.

So we get back to the hotel, without another hitch, and we check out, (btw the mall of america is closed on all holidays Especially easter... ) so we were there, no stores open so we decide to go back to airport.  I approach the counter, its like 6 hours till our flight.  Im exhausted, Jami is too, and we approach the man ""Is there any way to get us home sooner I ask""  he punches in his keyboard for a few minutes ""Well, hows about in 1 hour for dallas, put you getting home 3 hours early""  So instead of Chicago, we flew through dallas... and got home way early, a great way to end a rather long and exhaustive trip.

So anyways what am I doing this month?

I dunno when epople are getting back in state from college but I do know

I have a banquet to talk at from my old high school, high school graduation, a clique party, paige is having a baby, and hopefully I see all you guys too.  I work 8-5 but have the weekends and nights free all summer, gimme a shout.

Well im gonna goto bed, ... wow this post is long o.o;"

Greg.  So in comes Buck we need ot see everything all the sprinklers in your apartment.  Umm who the hell are you, I say.  ""We are here to inspect the sprinklers"" as he proceeds to start opening my pantry.  Umm my roomate is probably asleep elt me wake him or you might just get punched.  So Greg sits slum in the corner as nuts man darts about each sprinkler as if one will spout forth the nectar of life or something.  So I wake thomas and the guy heads in my room, walks into my closet and ""Oh we have a problem"" ""You have 20 seconds to get this stuff off the shelf in your closet or im writting you a violation""  ""Where the hell is that written?""  ""Doesnt matter, get it down immediately or we are gonna have a serious fine here""  So I take the ... VCR off the top shelf ... you know where it sat ... ON THE SHELF 10 months.  So I ask the guy, doesnt that kinda need to be written if Im suppose to know about it?  Not my problem kid, and he darts out of my apartment.  Now the timid foreigner woulda been careful afraid they violated something thats gonna get them kicked outta the country.  But I the asshole, proceed to inquire.  I pull out my friendly list of numbers.  ""Hello, housing and dining""  ""Apartment inspects this week of sprinkler""  ""Oh you need apartments, one second""  ""Hello, Apartment office""  ""Yeah, we having sprinkler inspections this week?""  ""Let me check, yes two guys""  ""Yeah, well who are they to tell me that im about to get a ticket because of some stuff on a shelf in my closet""  ""They told you what?""  ""Yeah, and Im miffed off about it""  ""One second""  ""Gordon wilson""  ""Yeah, gordon two guys walk into my apartment and proceed to inspect my sprinklers then tell me im gonna get written up because of some crap on my shelf""  ""Only the fire marshal can do that""  ""Thats who he said he was""  ""No he's a private contract maintenance worker""  ""Well, can he gimme a ticket""  ""No, I need to investigate this, he appears to be overstepping his bounds""  10 minutes later.  BANG BANG.  Gordon walks in, ""Let's see what has him in such a mood""  So gordon inspects the scene,  ""Well, if thats a violation they need to tell us about it in our handbooks, and they need to tell us NOT you of the problem, he is overstepping his bounds.""  ""Yeah, I would of gladly but he was being awfuly hateful""  ""Dont worry about it, I like to teach maintenance workers their mouths need to stay shut and their power where it belongs""  Gordon leaves my apartment and pursues the maintenance workers to their next victim."

That leaves the project with two members and alot of changes to be made.  I have been forbidden to email anyone or respond to anything about the project.  As such my first official act was the Block her on AIM.  That was kewl, no more her asking about how the project is coming along....

So the Lab decides today that two of us are almost out of money.  I have 55 hours left ... FOR THE SEMESTER.  Roger says ""Now Like a good lab worker you should just cut your hours""  so without hesitation I dropped hours that I didnt want ..... which includes 3 times when im the only worker here.  Not my fault you fudged paperwork and didnt pay me out of the right budget during the winter break.  So yeah, 5.5 hours a week for the rest of the semester in the lab... FUN STUFF.  And to think I helped out taking 24 hours that a guy was sick / the only one working over a 2 week period.... that eats WS money fast... FU lab

So my grandfather is doing good, they checked his pace maker and gave it a clean bill of health on friday.  On Saturday the battery died ... (umm ... can we say LAWSUIT).  So it was malfunctioning and working in reverse or some such crap.  So anyways ... they went in on monday did some scans and test and tuesday installed his new cable tv, internet and wifi (joke of course) pace maker ... the instruction manual is roughly 400 pages long ... (did we not opt for the fax machine attachment damn it that woulda been handy) it has like all sorts of gauges and stuff ... like a phone monitoring ability so they can check it via phone (somehow), and other weird crazy things like the ability to function as a defib (doesnt that take lots of power?  Maybe it runs on a small thermonuclear reactor) and other crazyier things (satelite tv I suspect) the Doctor refers to this as the 357 of the pace makers ... so it goes fast I guess ... at least thats what my cousin said ... gotta make fun of the fact a device you have no user control over has a larger instruction manual than both my computer AND my car."

I finished it as val was just ready to go.  One homework assignment from hell down.  Then comes time for class he is going to do most of our next homework assignment in class (W00t!?!).  Then comes work time in the lab, I balanced my checkbook, scheduled my grad check, and began applying for grad school.  Time for class again, I finished my application and submit it online.  Grad School done! (w00t!?!?!!?).  I also finish my financial aid info for next spring, semester all paid for.   My mom calls (in class ... I called her back) and she is sending 5k to TU for my Tuition.  (W00t!@#!@#!@#!@#)  My cars getting tinted for Xmas from my parents.  I go in, and its offical Liz Enochs confirms that I am graduating.

Dr Pomeranze is helping me on the mathematica, she said to stop by her office tommrow and she will give me all the assistance I need to finish.  My goal is to finish EE, Stat, and Numerical methods before friday afternoon.  And before I return back to school finish my linguistics paper, my new stat assignment and my new EE assignment.  So I have no homework that last week.  Its so close to time for this to end, and I hate the fact teachers cram so much shit in at the end.  Basically, my homework load this week is more than the entire rest of the semester.  Seriously 4 homework assignments in stat and 2 the last two weeks thats stupid.  EE he assigned DOUBLE problems due on monday and then is assigning MORE tommrow, its just STUPID, plan your damn semesters better, piling shit up at the end is stupid."

The funeral is wens @10:30 at the Stigher High School Gymnasium.  The entire student body is attending.  Additionally, we are caravaning the 54 miles (just looked it up) to the family cemetary plot in Bache Oklahoma.  From there, I will be returning Wens evening to Tulsa.  

Its truely amazing, just how close knit the community is.  So far, my parents have over twenty days worth of food prepared for them at the house, with more coming every day.  Two fridges full of prepared meals, so that mom nor dad has to worry about cooking.  My entire, and I mean ENTIRE extended family is staying at our house tommrow.  The funeral is @10:30 so the entire family is meeting at the funeral home beforehand.  All my mothers, RP, Mrs. Cox, Mrs. Debby, have all called and ensured my family was doing okay, additionally Val, Beth (Pa), Leo, Kensey, Xhad, Ian, Jordan, Mike, Mike F., Priya, Paul, Mary, Sarah, Melanie, Jeffrey, Becky, Arlo, and Ashley (I might have forgotten a few) have all called or emailed asking if I needed anything.  The University has set me up so nice, that I frankly am shocked.  Gamble has extempted me from all group meetings until I am ready to return, Coberly offered to help me catchup once I returned to classes if I fell behind.  The rest of my teachers arent assigning me any homework until I return back to classes.  Additionally QT has exempted me from my work schedule for the rest of the week, although I am trying to go back on Sunday.

"event","Well, last night my life took a turn for the worst.  I was on the way to McDonalds when I get a phone call.  ""Kyle, get in touch with your parents""  so I make a mad rush to call.  It turns out my kid sister was in a car accident.  The severity of the situation was unknown at the time.  I get a phone call ""Kyle, they are rushing her to Tulsa via med-flight""  I put the family emergency system into action.  I rush to Jami's unable to drive myself.  The entire time calling aunts, uncles, grandparents.  Within 5 minutes the entire three branches of my family are notified, we are all on the way to Saint Francis, I am the first to arrive.  We rush to the ER waiting anxiously to find out anything.  10 minutes pass, no word.  20 minutes pass, no word.  30 minutes pass, Jami is about to MURDER the woman at the desk.  The helicopter never arrived.  ""It could have been diverted""  ""Can you tell us WHERE?""  ""Umm, thats gonan take time""  Finnally through a stroke of luck, I reach the Stigler hospital, the helicopter turned around mid flight.  My sister grew rapidly unstable in the air and it was too risky.  She coded, again, again, again, again, and then began to lose the ability to respirate.  Minutes later she passed away.  By this time, we were already half way to Muskogee, and I began contacting the entire COU informing them first of the accident and then ... more importantly the death.  Half my family lost cell phone reception and drove all the way to Tulsa before I could divert them back to Stigler.  When we finally arrived in Muskogee we picked up Paige, another of my friends of half my life.  ""But she is my Kid sister"" was Paiges most heartfelt statement.  We finally reached Val, another of my closest friends, and asked her to find Leo.  The COU for many of the last years has been fading, but last night it helped to such an extent, its unbelieveable.  We arrived in Stigler, we reach the hospital.  By this time, a large LARGE crowd had gathered.  All in all 4 kids had been in the accident.  I see my fathers family.  They (10 or 11) were all standing there knowing I was soon to arrive.  Within moments I was being passed from person to person.  A nurse ask if I would like to see my sister one last time.  ... ... ouch, I lost it here.  So my grandfather, having already lost my father, again has to walk me down the long LONG halls to the ER table where my sister laid.  I walked through fifty concerned people, all worried about my kid sister.  The medical examiner wouldnt let me see my sister, he was busy trying to determine anything chemical that could have been involved.  So my family walks be back to the waiting room, when another nurse comes up to me.  As the only person in my family still at the hospital (they had taken my mother home), the hospital asked me to tell everyone to please leave the hospital, because there were several hundered people there.  Among them, was Amy and Kayla.  I broke into tears again, Amy and I have had some ... difficult times in the past, but always were there for each other in times of crisis.  I didnt even know she was back yet, it was amazing I dont even know how she heard, but she was there.  So I walk back and ask them, telling anyone to meet at my house that needs a place to think.  Most stayed, all 4 kids were friends.  All four of them had thousands of friends and family all worried.  My sister was all that died last night.  We gathered at my house, the center nexus of my childhood years.  My step fathers family is all waiting, and my moms friend and caretaker Thresa pulls in as I step out of my car.  My mother is handling it at this point very well, (I found out later, she was on about 15 medications to stabilize).  They are more worried about me, a pale color kinda of shelled up.  I havent eaten anything but a burrito all day, and my blood sugar was so incredibly low, coupled with the stress it was becoming hard to remain concious and strong.  So my mother whips out some steak and fries and everyone watches me eat.  I couldnt take it, I had to leave the room.  Eventually I hear the story, they decided to drag race cars on a quarter mile stretch when a car came around the corner towards the end, and the other truck clipped the one my sister was in.  The car went into a spin, throwing all the passengers out, my kid sister accross pavement at high velocity.  MUCH reconstructive surgery is in order to return her to the beautiful face behind the removed skin.  So I finnaly reach my mothers family, they are in Tulsa, and already on the way to the house.  ... I told my aunt Mel who then informed my grandmother.  About an hour later they arrive at my house.  During that time, I had to get away, my friends all went to Walmart, I needed something cafenated, my headache was severe.   So I get back to the house, and give Jordan a tour.  Jordan ... was a grand trooper, 4 days in and he was already dealing with a death in my family.  He didnt flinch once, just stood there, unable to do anything because of the proximity of my unknowing family.  Smiling and being another of my ""concerned"" friends when anyone asked who he was.  We go through the house, through the usual ""50 cent"" tour, and get to my sisters room, boy was that rough, just Monday I sat at her computer desk and freshly installed windows on a computer for her.  Just monday we had sat and watched a movie at 2 AM togther waiting on the install to finish.  So we return down stairs, and then the arrangements are being put together.  The funeral is wens (afternoon) at the Stigler High School.  I believe any of my friends that want to come, can sit with me, anyone is welcome, although I am not requiring anyone to come.  Then my concerend aunt not waiting my mom to make any difficult decisions ask me, ""Is she going to the family burial plot ... in Mcalester?""  Boy another rough one, 13 years ago last week my father was put into the ground.  And now its time to put someone else in.  In the midst of all this, I get a phone call, its the organ donation people.  My sister lacked an Identification, and they wanted to know what the family wanted.  My mother was unstairs, so my step father and I made the call.  We couldnt do that to my mother.  The thought of helping people is compeling, but when your faced with it, its a VERY VERY rough time.  So my moms family arrives, we just went through my uncles death the last weeks of June.  My entire family again starts crying.  My mother however, in all this was able to make over three gallons of coffee.  Everyone is standing around.  Its finally so late in the night, I began asking people to go home so they can try and get rested up after the night.  My dads family finnaly leaves, its taken a large toll on my grandparents.  4J is the family ranch brand.  Standing originally for Charles and Joyce (grandpa and ma) and Selina and Doug (my aunt and my father).  My aunt married and my father had two kids.  When he passed away we were again 4J.... and now ... we arent anymore.  The look in his eye, told more than he was saying.  They gave me money, worried about me.  Somewhere around 60 to 100 dollars, so I could makeup the many trips to and from Stigler over the week.  Finally, its my time to go home, Amy and Kayla are ready to go also, Its 3:30 in the morning by time we finally get to Muskogee.  Jordan, is taking care of me, and is staying with me till the funeral as much as possible.  QT, gave me an open leave of absence so I dont have to worry about work this week.  Jason K, once knowing the situation found people to cover all my shifts, a BIG heart felt thanks for that.  So this is where I was last night, I'll be home and online most of the day.  Ill post anything else here (for my friends that live far off) once I know more."

Thursday (last week) I had my second stat test.  It didnt go so bad, it was alot more straightforeward than the first test.  Today, I have spent about three hours studying for my 2nd Numerical Methods test, it really doesnt look bad.  I mean, four problems we pick three and I can work all of the old test so I dont think it will be too bad.  And Friday I have the dreaded 2nd EE Circuit Analysis class, other than Red Sox's Win (the answer to about ... 2/3's of our quizes) I cant really say I know much about the material.

On a different note (and extremly annoying might I add), I get to go home today!  It appears my parents cant afford to help me pay for college, but we are on ... our 3rd new computer for the house this year.  The 1st one is mom's the second one is dads (which he then took down to the family business), and now he went out for my mom's ""birthday"" and bought another computer .... for him.  So the took the other computer (from the shop) and gave it to my sister.  I have no clue the stats on it, I built it, well sometime in my early high school years, and now its stopped working.  This means one of two things, the damn thing got tired of the endless hours of smoking, dust clogged air of the shop and the house.  Or, the more likely of the two, its clogged with so much god damn spyware, adware, and crap they've downloaded that it just cannot fucking function anymore.  They are not sure what OS its running, or where the drivers CD ""Whatever you do, dont lose this CD"" ""Where'd you put the CD"" ""In a safe place, dont worry"" and I call ""Umm, we cant seem to find that CD you told us to keep""  YES!  I want to spend my night at home guessing what hardware I ordered for this beast 8 years ago, which I have nothing to go off of other than it came from pricewatch.  At least I get to vote, well I'm not really going to vote for any other reason than the state questions.  Casino's, smoking tax, beer money for college students (.... if only), and the definition of marriage.  Fuck off Oklahoma, you can barely afford to send our kids to school let alone dictate who I can marry.  More than likely, I will write in people for all the election spots, hell I havent got the foggiest clue about anyone in my county and whats up for office this year, nor do I care.   I mean seriously, goto Stigler sometime, who gives a fuck about the county commisioner ... I mean seriously ... WOW 8000 people and we got like 100 elected officials in the county (something like that its absurd).  As for the president, either way we are pretty much fucked, if Bush stays were all gonna keep fighting for the next 4 years, if Kerry stays, he will pull our troops out, and Bush Jr. Jr. some years down the road will have to launch the renewed War on Terror."

On another note, it appears that some people ... were offended by the comment about the alcohol that I made yesterday.  I hope it did, perhaps then it will teach everyone to be more responsible.  We have yet to have a party where someone didnt get so trashed that they definately shouldnt drive, and yet, that never stops anyone.  We've gotten luck so far, but one time, someone's gonna get in deep shit when they get caught."

"event","Okay, ive fucking had it.  Ive wasted my last GOD DAMN weekend, day, time off, waiting on fucking people.

Lets see, I made plans with Jason on my 4 day weekend, he doesnt even fucking call to tell me he isnt comming.  

Next week, I made plans with all my friends to go see a movie, Ben and Jami call about ... 15 minutes after they were suppose to be here and cancle.

Next week, Leo is suppose to come up, I get out of work early so I can spend time with him, I wait from 9:00 PM till .... 2:00 AM hoping that maybe he had car trouble or something.  Next morning, wake up goto class, wait around ALL DAY.  Call his house, his sister is being a bitch to me, like I am not good enough to take Leo's time up and is like ""Well he isnt home"" ""When will he be"" ""Later"" ""Can you have him call me?"" ""Ill be at the game"".  So he finnaly DOES call me at 08:50 PM at night ... 24 FUCKING hours after he is suppose to be here.  I was hoping ot see the movie with him, but to no avail.  Ive thrown up ... at least 10 times today because I am physically sick over this.  My god damn best friend on the planet, FORGOT about me.  Not only mildly forgot, forgot entirely and ruined my chance to see him.  Well we have next thursday, but well I work later, I dont have off from the lab, and everything is just a mess now.

Perhaps if I fucking died, the people I care about wouldnt MISS my funeral.  I swear, this is all becoming too much,"

"event","Well, I have an Evolutionary computation test in 2 hours and 15 minutes.  Taking a breather after that very nice Diffie final.  I worked 3 problems completely and the 4th one I got about 80% of it accomplished.  I ran out of time, because I forgot to multiply something (at the start of problem 3) and had to compeltely rework it, but I got it solved.

I uploaded a web comic to orbital.  Its in the cool folder under /redvsblue/  its completely great, a good couple of hours worth of laughs.  

Thats all for now time to get my study on for the other test :)

and he's outta here"

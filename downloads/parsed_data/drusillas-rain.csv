"event","I'm having a hard time believing that the first part of my trip is already done!

I've been in downtown Seattle since Sunday and am heading out of town for the HP Slash Con. <lj-cut text=""cut for emotional stuff"">I think I'm emotionally doing a lot better, in that I've been able to figure out a lot of the things that had been making me unhappy and that I'd been suppressing. But I also still feel a bit emotionally numb, which is a bit weird for me.

J and I have also been talking constantly. We may possibly reconcile. He misses me. I miss him. After hours of conversation via skype I believe him when he says how things will change (both for me and for him, including the substantive steps he's taking to change). But, I still feel incredibly enmeshed and still think about my day in terms of him, even though I'm on the other side of the continent. I pretzeled myself around him and I can't do that anymore. But I feel adrift without having him to define me.

Crap, this was supposed to be about my adventures, not about my fucked up brain.</lj-cut>

Ok, let's back up a little bit.

<lj-cut text=""Sunday, June 12""><b>Sunday, June 12</b> - I didn't go to sleep from Saturday to Sunday because I was being slow about packing, and also my cab was set to pick me up at 4am for a 6am flight. So, around 2am I finally got around to printing my boarding pass, only to discover that my flight had been cancelled.

Which, I don't know if this has ever happened to you, but the only time I ever had a change in flight status was when there were epic storms and I was stranded in the airport for over 8 hours. But this is the new and empowered new me, who handles stress and uncertainty with poise and grace. So, I called the airline and yelled at the first person who answered *blush* It turns out I was put on a different flight that would be leaving 20 minutes after I was originally to leave. I'm not sure how much of a difference it made overall, except that I got to see the Philadelphia airport instead of the Charlotte one.

Saying good-bye was hard. J and I have been civil and even loving for the past 2 weeks since the breakup (with expected flashes of anger and heartbreak). <strike>And by loving I mean averaging 2-4 times a day *blushes* which has been fun but ridiculous and I think I finally understand hatesex</strike> 

Once I got to customs things were looking up, at least until I spoke to the customs agent who was wondering why I was travelling alone on vacation to Seattle. It was a thoroughly unpleasant exchange but eventually I told him I impulsively was visiting a place I'd never been to because I'd been dumped. That didn't necessarily garner any sympathy, but he let me go.

Eventually, my luggage and I made our way through security and I was on my way to passing out on the 2 planes and the waiting areas. Oh! My luggage! I bought the most awesome purple suitcase! I'll post pics of it with the rest later in a separate post, but it seriously makes me so happy ^_^

On the plane, I sat next to a very attractive gentleman about 15 years older than me. We chatted about the kind of trivial things strangers talk about. Eventually I told him about my heartbroken state, and he invited me to a party that night! He's a sales rep for Loreal and was in town for a few days (it certainly explained his perfect hair ;p). I have to admit it was tempting to take him up on his offer. If nothing else, it was really nice to be desired. 

Seattle is a very cool city - if you ever visit, I recommend <a href=""http://www.moorehotel.com/"">The Moore Hotel</a>. It's incredibly basic, but the bed and bathroom were clean, and there's free wifi. I don't really need much more than that, especially given the price. It's also within walking distance of the waterfront.

That first night I had dinner at a fantastic Vietnamese place, and then promptly passed out around 7:30pm Seattle time.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Monday, June 13""><b>Monday, June 13</b> - Mostly, I spent the day walking around the waterfront. First I had a fantastic coffee and flaky pastry at Pike Market Place. I spent a few hours exploring the different buildings and stalls, where you can buy fresh produce, fish, crafts, hats (hats!), etc. I bought some postcards, some truffle-flavoured salt (which omg I can't wait until I get back home to be able to try it on something grilled), and a fridge magnet. I've never been big on souvenir's, but I love to pick-up fridge magnets where ever I go.

For lunch, I grabbed some local cheese, fresh crusty bread, a small basket of cherry tomatoes and a brownie, then after lunch headed out to walk along the water. It was very cool to see mountains in the distance - normally when I think of ocean, I think of a vast expanse of nothingness.

I also did a bit of shopping, having discovered an awesome burlesque-ish/50-ish style dress shop. When I was packing, I ended up leaving about 2 skirts and 5 tops behind, so I figured I could add 1 dress at the very least to my collection of stuff to wear ;)</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Tuesday, June 14""><b>Tuesday, June 14</b> - Today was the day I got to meet up with <lj user=elfflame>! She was just as lovely in person as online and I was thrilled to spend the day with one of my oldest lj friends ^_^

She took me on the bus to the Seattle Space Needle (and I'm so glad she was on the bus with me, because I was the total stupid, gaping tourist at the differences in transit >.<). The elevator up the Space Needle is ridiculously fast, even if it isn't as high up as Toronto's CN Tower ;p (But we did bond over scenes from Forever Night!)

I have a teeny fear of heights, and get occasional vertigo, depending on how my ears are doing that day (from recurring ear infections blech), but I love the view of being so high up and seeing across the city to take it all in. I find until I'm up that high, I can't really orient myself in a new city, which is a bit weird since I know that I can't exactly pick out any details or even that I'll see the whole city from the ground level. Maybe it's a feeling free thing.

We then walked around some more, and passed by the very cool Frank Gehry music museum (he's one of few architects that I actually recognize by name). I was very amused to find out that certain things from the Simpson's were inspired by Seattle, including Krusty the Clown and the Monorail. And yes, when we walked past the monorail, I couldn't help but sing the Monorail song, complete with jazzhands ^_^

It was also just very cool hanging out with someone who has the same interests and context in life. Even though this was the first time that <lj user=elfflame> and I met IRL, we were able to get past the nervous stage very quickly, and switch from talking about tv (Castle!!!) and books, to personal things going on in our lives, and then back again. I have good friends back home, but the reason I always come back to lj (and love going to cons) is that there is a particular connection that I've never really found anywhere else.

Overall, it was a fantastic day!</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Wednesday, June 15""><b>Wednesday, June 15</b> - Today was more walking around, even though I got a bit of a later start than I expected. I also ended up sitting in a Starbucks for about 2 hours to get some work done on one of the projects I'd transitioned to someone else in my absence. It was surprisingly easy to concentrate, especially given my struggles last few months with my inability to focus on anything. I can definitely see the appeal of working remotely ^_^

I went to check out the Seattle Art Museum and discovered a fantastic new artist! Her name is Cris Brodahl, and she's part surrealist, yet her figures are real and very sensual. I'm definitely going to try to remember to look for more exhibits with her work. I can't find my favourite piece of the collection, but you can find samples of here work <a href=""http://thefoxisblack.com/2011/05/11/cris-brodahl/"">here</a> (Unfortunately the images don't convey the physicality of her work).

I also took a tour of Seattle's underground which was fascinating and I'm so glad I went on it. I learned all about Seattle's history of logging, it's role in the gold rush, the invention of flush toilets and city sewage, the Seattle fire in 1889 that destroyed over 30 city blocks, preservation of victorian buildings in the 1960s, and the role of Seattle's ""seamstresses"" in building the city in the late 1800s/early 1900s (men would pay $10 to get their ""pants hemmed""). I highly recommend it!</lj-cut>

So that's what's been happening so far. I've had way too much coffee so far, which has been very tasty, and Seattle is deservedly known for it's coffee. I've also enjoyed walking around (all these hills have been great for my legs and abs). And while I haven't totally figured out who I am yet, it's slowly starting (who knew that I actually prefer scrambled eggs to any other kind, so why have I been ordering over-easy all this time).

Now, that this is done, I'm off to catch a cab and make my way to the HP Slash con. If you're there and want to reach me, easiest way is via email/lj's msg system.

As an aside, omg, how did I manage to live without an iPhone so far?????

by Sarah Ockler

<blockquote><i>Why Do People Hate On Dreams?

I think part of it is that some people -- even well-meaning people who love us and truly believe they have our best interests at heart -- can get so stuck in their own modes that they can't imagine a life where someone makes different (i.e., non-traditional) choices, and makes those choices work. And instead of asking questions and learning about it, or just being encouraging and supportive, or just plain STFU-ing, they become dream squishers. They try to talk us out of it, or put down the successes we've already earned (and by ""successes,"" I mean whatever goals or achievements we set for ourselves, which often have nothing to do with money or promotions or levels or anything like that). They insist we need backup plans, because that's what they were taught. Because that's the smart, logical, successful thing to do.</i></blockquote>

This has been on my mind a lot lately - I wonder what my life would have been like if I hadn't tried to squeeze myself into the mold of the stable workforce, but instead took writing classes or went to auditions. I think about how unhappy my 20s were when I was trying to change myself to fit into normal society. It didn't work though, and now I'm struggling to compete with bright and confident 20-year olds, as well as salvage relationships with people who didn't realize my current path is where I'm meant to be."

"event","<b>Election</b>
So depressed about the election in Canada. I mean, I'm happy that the NDP has done so well, but I'm sickened by the thought of the conservatives having so much power. I'm also terrified of how much it will affect my quality of life as someone who works in the charitable/not-for-profit sector (not to mention working towards being a published writer). 

<b>ADHD</b>
I've booked an assessment for officially confirming that I have ADHD. The self-assessments all point to definitely yes, but I was never diagnosed as a child since I was considered imaginative and eccentric, but never disruptive. My ability to focus just keeps getting worse and worse though, so I think it's time to try medication. I'm terrified of doing this, but I know I can't live this way anymore.

"event","So, in case this isn't obvious from my lj posts, I have very little faith in my own capabilities. I also tend to only hear the unsupportive comments and not really believe the supportive ones. I'm past the point where I need to chart a new course for my life. I've done that, I have the plans and the reality checks, etc. What I need now is something that I've never had in my life - external faith that I can actually do this.

What am I asking for?

A 3-month commitment one day a week via skype or IM where we chat about my writing progress. I want to be able to tell you what I've been writing, how much I've been writing, how much progress I made. I need someone to tell me that they believe in me.

In return, I can do the same.

Maybe if there's enough interest we can even create a group that ""meets"" once a week.

If this sounds like something you're interested in, please comment (all comments are screened on this post). Let me know if you'd like to set up a reciprocal relationship, be part of a group, or just be willing to listen to me talk (and know that I will appreciate it more than anything)."

One of the most inspiring, but in a realistic kind of way, pieces about wanting to be an artist/writer/creative-type.

When I was little, I convinced myself that I couldn't draw. So I didn't. As it turns out, that wasn't necessarily true - I was unskilled, and over the past few years I've experimented with charcoal drawings. This simple piece uses layers of colour and textures, and I need to figure out how to build time into my schedule to do more of this (less reading, more painting?).

<a href=""http://www.dendarii.com/sex.html"">Lois McMaster Bujold on Writing Sex</a>
I think she's become one of my favourite scifi/fantasy authors because she started out with fanfiction, and she approaches sex and relationships in the same way as most good fanfic authors do. Some good thoughts here.

<b>And a fic finding request (H50):</b>

There was a Steve/Danny fic posted last fall (I think) where Danny went over to Steve's to help him patch up his house after his house got shot up. I now can't find that fic. Sound familiar anyone?"

I'm thinking of offering up homemade brownies for the charity auction, but I've never sent or received food in the mail, so a part of me is thinking ""won't they go stale?"". Or is there a specified shipping time I should pick that would prevent this. How do you ensure your baked goods don't go bad???

For those in Canada - can you only ship in Canada? Or could I ship to the US too?"

"event","There have been a few posts about WIP's on my flist lately, some of which I commented on, others of which I just didn't know what to say.

See, I have a WIP that effectively became the reason I withdrew from HP fandom.

<lj-cut text=""The background""><b>The background</b>
I swore I would never ever post a WIP. I have binders and files of unfinished stories. I never participate in those ""what's in your WIP folder"" memes, because it would take way too long for me to list everything. I'm also a fairly slow writer. But then I came up with the idea for <a href=""http://drusillas-rain.livejournal.com/13959.html"">Drow</a> - it was inspired by some art, and was only going to be a short one-shot, which then grew. I outlined it. I posted 3 times a week. And it totally worked.

Until I realized it was a trilogy.

The second part went pretty well - I wasn't posting as frequently, but with the outline, I was able to get through it.

Then came part 3, which is where it all fell apart.

It's all outlined. I still think about it at least once a week, even though it's been over 4 years since I last posted. At the time, I was going through a really rough time and as a result had really bad writer's block that last 2 years. When it finally cleared I wanted to write again, but Drow was there and I couldn't let myself write anything until it was done. Except, Drow still wasn't happening. So, I switched to original fiction. The occasional drabble. I've done 2 fests, that I never linked to my lj because it felt like a complete betrayal to the readers of Drow.

<b>Betrayal?</b>
The last chapter of Drow was posted in 2006 and I still get the occasional anon comment of ""so, you gonna finish this or what?"". It breaks my heart every time, because I hate when it happens to me as a reader. I've also distanced myself from HP fandom, which honestly makes me sad. I mean, I still participate in the online HP community, but in a ""I care about your existence"" kind of way. I've also embraced new fandoms.

Look, I know Drow isn't the best story in fandom. But it was the first story that I really let myself explore the kind of writing I wanted to do. I used to even discuss the plot points with a non-fandom friend over dinner and he was fascinated by the twists and turns, as were the readers.

<b>So what now?</b>
TLDR from above - wtf do I do now? How do I fix this?

Over the past year I've been working really hard on my output as a writer, both in fandom and original fiction. I wrote a holiday fest fic that's even been recced on <lj user=""crack_broom""> (so I guess it means it doesn't totally suck) that was over 10K. I'm working on submitting a 2nd original story to my RL critique group and that I hope to submit to a mentoring program for new writers. I'm blogging more in various places. But, I feel that if I ever want to move on and really be able to feel free to write, I need to finish Drow.</lj-cut>

<b>Your thoughts here</b>
I want to finish <a href=""http://drusillas-rain.livejournal.com/13959.html"">Drow</a>. I want to take the folder with all my notes in it which has lived on my desk since 2006 (even through a major renovation of my study) and do something with it.

But, how? Do I go back and re-edit what was posted and then re-post it chapter by chapter? 
Do I just leave the chapters where they are and start posting it again section by section? 
Or do I finish it and then just post it all in one big chunk on AO3?

Thoughts? Opinions? Rants? Hugs? All would be appreciated.

Ok, this is surprising. I actually feel lighter having written this all out. That kind of soul-bearing relief doesn't usually happen to me. But I want to make things right with the world and with fandom. Thanks for listening <3"

Have some H5O recs:

<a href=""http://gyzym.livejournal.com/63839.html"">Don't turn me home again</a> by <lj user=gyzym> (Steve/Danny)
<i>Summary: After a rough day of island living, Danny wakes up in New Jersey and learns the hard way to be careful what he wishes for.</i>
I love stories that take the time to not only project ""what if"" but also take the time to develop it. Without spoiling too much, Danny wakes up and finds out that he and Rachel never divorced, and we follow both how he changed in the canon time line as well as the alternate one. (And yes, of course Steve shows up because they are meant to be ^_^) Great read!

<i>Groundhog Day AU. Danny finds himself trapped in the same day over and over again.</i>
I love these kinds of stories and this one is a satisfying contribution to the trope and the fandom. Overall fun read!

"event","Or the ongoing saga of a story I'm determined to get published.

It's been two weeks since my critique group gave me a ton of feedback on an original short story and every day I plan on revising it so that I can send it out (I've already got an anthology that it fits to send it to first, along with some potential mags). Of course, since I'm writing on lj, I haven't done more than remap the arc and waffle.

<lj user=tripperfunster> gave me the idea to talk to some of the ppl in my group on what to do now, and that was helpful in terms of deciding how to make sure it feels like a short story vs the first chapter of a novel. The rest though has been along the lines of ""don't listen to person x, y or z"" and ""ultimately you decide what to do"". The don't listen to person x/y/z I already figured out on my own. It's the second piece of advice that's kind of making me want to tear my hair out.

There are multiple directions I could go in with this story, from changing or removing certain characters, strengthening one element vs another, etc, and being the on-the-fence kind of person, I'm having a really hard time making the kind of decisions I need to make. I think I need to talk it out with someone, but I have no idea how to go about doing that. 

Any suggestions for what you do/how you do this?"

"event","As my <a href=""http://drusillas-rain.livejournal.com/158059.html"">emo post yesterday indicated</a>, I went through a critique with my local group last night. I brought in a short story that I was hoping they could help me fix up so that I could start submitting it to anthologies and magazines.

Here are the highlights:

1. Overall it didn't go as badly as I thought it would. I'm not sure if it's because the comments were more positive or if I'm just better at hearing the positive comments.

It also helped that the other woman who's story was being critiqued is one of our best and most published authors. She's also in her 60s (or 70s) and she was just as nervous as I was. We joked about how we should just slip out or how we both considered not coming. At the end of the night we hugged for surviving it. (It also helped that her submission was a rough draft of an experiment so it was a lot less polished than usual.)

2. There was a surprisingly large group last night - there were even a few members that I haven't seen in about a year, as well as some new folks that I've only met once or twice before (including the usual crowd). I heard comments from 20 people.

Mostly, I'm overwhelmed with the amount of feedback. The night is structured so that each individual gets 3 minutes to say what they want to say (or maybe it's 2, I can never remember, but that's why we have a timekeeper). And I took copious notes. Then there's a free-for-all discussion, which was interesting but less useful, and then they each give me a marked up manuscript.

3. Almost everyone thought it was the start of a longer piece. This one is problematic, because while I'm not done telling stories from this universe, I don't want to commit to a novel for it. I already have another novel I want to work on in 2011, and to be honest, I'm tired of writing the first chapter of different novels. I want something I can finish and submit. Someone else suggested writing a suite of short stories, and I think that might be the way to go in the future. 

In the meantime, I need to cut down on the set-up - it's too slow and epic given the length of the piece.

4. I need more detail. The detail I have is vivid, but I need even more of it. When Jeff read it (he reads everything I write) he thought it was the most descriptive story I'd ever written. But, everyone's feedback was that if I want to write high fantasy, it can't be minimalistic, because otherwise readers are going to fill in their own images. E.g., if you allude to an old wizard they're going to think Gandalf or Dumbledore, even if they look different.

5. I need to clarify in my own head who's story I'm telling - the short immediate piece or the long quest.

6. Some of the feedback I received was less helpful - what does it mean to vary tone? How do you <b>actually</b> go about doing that?

7. Best feedback of the night (which a few members after apologized to me for) was a rambling dialogue in which I think he wanted me to reach for better and not write fantasy because I don't need magic to be creative. (And by best I mean, he kept trying to explain what he was saying, and I kept trying to figure out what the hell he was talking about. He's our most famous member of the group and generally the best editor too, so everyone was a bit wtf are you on?) To be honest, it mostly made me lol.

<b>NON-TLDR VERSION OF ABOVE</b>
A few of us went to the pub last night after the critique and I got some good guidance on what to do now. I had planned on emailing a few ppl from the group to see if we could meet and figure out an editing process, but I think I might actually be ok to try it out on my own first.

I <b>really</b> appreciate everyone's comments from yesterday. It helped me from retreating into my own head and encouraged me to seek advice from the others in person, rather than collapse in a sobbing heap while locking away all the notes never to be looked at again.

"event","For the past few years I've been part of a local critique group. We meet every 2 weeks and about 8-12 of us give our feedback to 2 authors who submit either a short story or a chapter of a longer story. Tonight I'm up.

Last January I submitted a short story that I couldn't go back to to until about a month ago. The comments were all valid - the members are very good about giving praise as well as what needs to be fixed - but it's just so hard for me to figure out what to do with the feedback once I receive it. It's also incredibly crushing to hear that many people tell you that you suck. Well, it's not that they do that, it's just what I hear and what I'm left with.

I've learned a lot about writing over the past year, and over the past month I went back and completely rewrote what I submitted last year. Tonight, the new draft is being re-critiqued.

I really thought I'd be fine, but I have the feeling that tomorrow I'm not going to be ok. It's like today I love the world, but tomorrow everything will be more gray. Part of me doesn't even want to show up. Another part of me is curious what they'll say.

I want to be published. I want this to be the best story I can write. I know that the only way this is going to happen is if I get feedback on it, because inevitably I'll have missed something (or a million somethings). I just don't know how to be ok with the process.

Part of it is that it's in person. Part of it is information overload. And that not everyone in the group reads or likes fantasy. The group is also of varying levels - some are published and others (like me) aren't. Some have a really good sense of how to fix a manuscript, others are clueless. I know all these things, yet, last time I went through this process (and the other 2x I've submitted things) I found it incredibly difficult to separate out the good feedback from the useless.

Tomorrow, I want to be ok. I don't want to get depressed and mope and stop writing, which is what happened last year. I don't want to leave this story for another year and not submit it anywhere. Or not even be able to look at it. I'm tired about thinking about writing and not actually writing. I want to be ok with what I've written. And with myself.

I've already decided that my mantra for this year is to keep on fighting. I guess tonight is my first big test."

I'm planning on putting up a big post with pics and recipes soonish here on lj). We don't usually decorate the house, but since we had guests we put up some lights and trees, etc. Jeff's been itching to get them down, since it's now January, but I haven't been able to do it yet since in my family we would always leave it up until Epiphany (Or 3 Wise Men Day as I used to call it when I was a kid). Which I just realized is today, so I suppose it's coming down by Saturday.

2. I've been watching Hawaii 5-0 even though it's really not that good. But what they get down perfectly is the bickering between Steve and Danny. It's hot (yeah, I know it's not meant to be) and kind of adorable in an I want to eat your face kind of way.

I've just discovered a fic that captures that bickering and which leads to bickering-not-really-hate!sex. It keeps them in character and keeps them as testosterone-fuelled men. This fic is a fantastic example of how to successfully transition from a heated conversation to sex - something many attempt but few, imho, succeed at.

"event","I slept 12 hours last night, in an attempt to make up for the 3 hours sleep I got the night before. I had a deadline for a series of reports I do (from home for a client) and I *badly* underestimated how long it would take. A report like that typically takes me 3-4 hours. This time it was 25 hours, because they added something that I didn't notice until I started working on it.

Normally, I would get the work done and then berate myself to the point where I would typically be useless and spiralling into self-loathing today. But, I had an interesting thought at some point yesterday that's made me feel ok with the world.

So, if I'd done up a correct estimate, I *should* have spent 3-4 days last week working on this project. That would have meant that I couldn't have spent last Tuesday with Jeff as we prepared for our taxes (we're both self-employed so have a lot of receipts to collect, etc.) and just generally hung out (ok collecting receipts and doing taxes doesn't sound fun, but we were just taking it easy and we generally both like filing and spreadsheets and things). It also meant that I wouldn't have gone to see True Grit or hung out with a good friend on Wednesday. I wouldn't have spent all of Thursday writing and rewriting a 2nd draft of a short story for my critique group and which I'm planning on submitting to an anthology for publication. Or spent Saturday at a friend's vegan dinner party. (Friday I worked on another series of reports so that day would have been out anyway).

The point? This is the whole reason I wanted to be self-employed in the first place - I work a lot better when I dedicate a huge chunk of time to a project rather than spread it out over a few days/weeks/whatever. I got to do all of that, and so what if worked all of Sunday during the day, all night until 7am, and then most of Monday once I woke up. It's just how I work best and I think I'm starting to finally trying to work well with myself rather than try to be someone I'm not. So, I'm going to be applying this new approach to the new year and see how my goals progress this time.

(I did however miss out on hanging out with a group of fantastic women on Sunday but that might have happened even if I'd spread things out ""properly"".)"

As I was searching for a header I could copy-paste, I went back through my posts and was incredibly distraught to realize I haven't posted any fanfic to this journal since April 2009!

I've been focusing on writing original fic and I've participated in 2 fests since then, but I obviously haven't been doing a very good job of writing and posting any of it here. One of my goals for 2011 was to write more fanfic (not just original fic), so hopefully you'll see more in this space. I've already put together a plan for drabbling more for various 100 comms, I grabbed a table for prompts for female characters, and I have 3 stories I want to tell in 2011, including finishing Drow which, oh, god, I left off ages ago and no one probably remembers it anymore. Eep.

<b>Absolute Must Reads:</b>

<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lupin_snape/1767410.html"">""The strange and curious dreams of Herrn Ulrich Vilsak""</a> by anonymous. Snape/Lupin
If there's one story you read this year, this should be it. I've never seen anything quite like this story, especially not for a holiday fest. It's the kind of story that reminds me I'm a complete hack when it comes to trying to write, because everything about it was executed masterfully. The story is set in Prague in 1890 and involves time travel, memory loss and canon events as seen from Remus Lupin's perspective, as well as events from the inhabitants of the old Ghetto. I was completely swept up in it.

<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/hd_holidays/175230.html"">""The Page Eleven Wars""</a> by anonymous. Harry/Draco, NC-17.
If you're up to reading two stories, you really should read this one. It's the best PWP I've ever read, where the actual sex is incredibly detailed and varied, but not once is it repetitive or scroll-worthy, and is instead hot and passionate.


More Snape/Lupin recs:

<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lupin_snape/1759532.html"">""Blinded By Science""</a> by anonymous.
If you're in the mood for something with Indiana Jones style adventure and romance, this is the fic for you. It's a non-magical AU, featuring archaeology and ancient Egyptian artifacts.

<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lupin_snape/1762432.html"">""EPIPHANY: A Comedic Story of Mischance, Love, and Crossdressing""</a> by anonymous.
If you like fun but complicated romances full of misunderstandings and tragedy with a happy ending where everything is resolved, then this is definitely the story for you.

<a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/lupin_snape/1758251.html"">""The Stupendous Snupin Film Club""</a> ART by anonymous.

http://www.freakyfountain.com/

In case you missed the original post - I met one of the editors and founders of Freaky Fountain Press at a poetry launch, and we had a fantastic conversation about writing and publishing. They specialize in dark literary erotica that's rejected by pretty much everyone else - hardcored BDSM, non-con, necrophilia, various paraphilias, tentacles, etc. The only thing they outright reject is paedophilia and gratuitous torture porn (as well as anything badly written).

I was really impressed with the thoughtfulness of the conversation about the press, as well as the fact that they devote a full page at the end of each anthology to warnings - they're hoping that this concept will start a trend in the industry, and I have to agree with them (anyone who's ever picked up a mainstream book for reading before bedtime only to come across a badly written and gratuitous rape scene that didn't actually need to happen on camera will probably understand why.)

If you've been thinking of branching out into writing original dark erotica, or if you've got a short story or novel you're shopping around, I highly recommend you check out Freaky Fountain Press!"

"event","<lj-cut text=""cut for HP movie spoilery reaction""> Saw HP last night. I enjoyed it about as much as I hated movie 6 (which, considering I'm still ranting about it should say something).

Mostly what I wanted to post about was how fucking hot Lucius was! He's never really done it for me (there's been the occasional fic and the occasional Jason Isaacs moment but that's about it). The whole beaten down thing was really working for me though! When I have time in a few weeks I have to find fic based on this version of Lucius. Or I might write a day in the life of where he wakes up, takes a swig of firewhiskey so that he can make himself get out of bed, and is making his way through the Malfoy cellars.

The movie also reminded me how much I love dorky Harry.

A few other thoughts:
- woe Hedwig :( And Dobby (I teared up for both)
- one of the ppl I saw the movie with hasn't read the books and after the movie said ""I was really worried about George there when he got hit."" Ummmmmm, yeah (I'm pretty sure the rest of us played it cool and he'll be really shocked with the ending)
- ""Hi, I'm Bill Weasley"" - fail, but this is more an issue with movie 6
[forgot to add: - The scene of the three brothers was fantastic!
- The scene with Harry and Ginny at the beginning made me go awww
- Ron getting splinched and being tired and hungry and miserable before taking off was awesome!
- Ron saving Harry was a great moment, as were all the interactions between the trio
- the scene where Hermione obliviates her parents and then she dissapears from the photos was well done
- The scene at Godric's Hollow with Nagini transforming from Bathilda Bagshot was just as I pictured it]

ETA#2: I would love to see more fic of Snape/Burbage (even if it's just friendship/colleagues).</lj-cut>


Oh! and a canon question! Maybe this is actually explained in the books, but I honestly can't remember (and my books are currently packed up so I can't check).

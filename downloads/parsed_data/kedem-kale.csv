"event","<font color=""#3366ff"">I am so confused right now.... i feel like i have done something wrong.... i have a new boyfriend and we have been dating for a nmonth as of the 6th. And i feel great i really like him and he is good to me. he trats me right and he isn't like the other asses that i have dated.&nbsp; We hadd a fight tonight, and i am not even sure what started it.... To recap the last few weeks. my boyfriend lent his game cube to my brother ( I know stupid thing to do) but then JAmes took it amd he sold it to cash converters. When my boyfriend found out he was furious which is understandable.&nbsp; And he wants his money from JAmes for the Game.. Well I agree. But what he doesn't realize is that he is never going to get the money from James. There is no way that James has 300 dollars to replace the system and games and wireless controllers or whatever it is. And he has been going on about it ever since he found out. So the other night i told him that I didn't want to hear any more about it at all. ANd he agreed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you would figure that it would be over.&nbsp; Well this after noon Cher&nbsp; decided to tease him and tell hiom that she accidently broke his D.S game thingy. Well he got a little mad about it. I thought that it was no big&nbsp; deal she was havign a little bit of fun.&nbsp; Then today i started picking on him, and anyone who knows me knows that i say whatever is on my mind i don't ever think before i speak. SO tonight he got mad at me and he yelled at me and told me that it wasn't a good idea to have him pissed at me. LIke what the hell. I was joking if oyu can't take a joke. I am sorry. But i never have thought before i spoke. And most&nbsp; of the shit i say i don't even remember what i did say after it came out of my mouth. I can say something to you and not even realize that i said it. . I am just aa little annou=yed right now.&nbsp; It makes me so angry when people take the things that i say so seriously. like yes threre are some things that i want to&nbsp; be taken seriously but most of the time i am just joking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Then there is the fact that a certain person has had some problems over the last few weeks (I am not revealing an ideantity for their own sake) and i have not had a problem with it. But my god&nbsp; certain people need to hink before they speak on things they say to this person especially when they are in hte state they are ion. you need to think how what you say will impact people. Now i know i sound like a hugh hipocrit, and i am but you need to understand the situation. and if either of these peole ever read this then i hope they understand what i mean. i am njot angry at either person least of all the person&nbsp; with the problem. I love you. you were put in my life for a reason. and you are not going anywhere.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright now that i have rambled on and on and on. i am getting ready&nbsp; for bed i love yas and will talk more later byes<i></i></font>"

"event","Well as of right now I have Mom and Cherei mad at me. And the reason is that I didn't go to work this morning. I was so exhasted and I couldn't get up. And now Mom won't even speak to me and Cherie is still at work but I can imagine her being pissed when she gets home form work. And If Amanda yelled at her for me not being there then I will be talking to Amasnda. Becasue the only person she has the right top yell at is me. It wasn't Cherie's fault that I didn't get out of bed. It was my choice. And I need to find another job because I can't work at 6 in the morning and go to school at the same time. I need to find a job that will let me work in he evenings during the week. But only two shifts. From like 5 till 10 would be perfect. But I don't know.&nbsp; The course load this year is going to be insane. The way that my instructors were talking this week is it going to be none stop from here on out. And they are saying 2 hours a night of homework and like 6 on the weekends. So I am going to be swamped. And they asked us one question yesterday and it was. ""Which is more imp[ortant school which you are paying for or work ?"" And it was a good question But right now I am so confused that I am going to go back and lay down Byes for now."

"event","<font color=""#ff00ff"">GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!! Could anything else go wrong today???<br /><br />I feel like everything is falling apart. Including my bed. The headboard just feel off and won't reatach. And I just want&nbsp; to scream. I feel so out of control right now.&nbsp; Mom said to me today that if I knocked down a wall then she would kick me out. I know she was joking but the fact is .. is that she said she would kick me out. I feel like crying. I know she wouldnm't kick me out but when she said it I felt like she was telling me the truth. And it is exactly a year since Eleanor andf Paul told me to get out. ANd I couldn't stand to loose Cherie and Joanne. They are my everything.; They are my world. And I don't know what I would do if I got kicked out. I have no where else to go.&nbsp; I have to go and finish cleaning my room and to go cry. </font>"

"event","I am so happy. I have everything that I ever asked for. Maybe someone really is looking out for me. For a long time I felt like I was all alone in the world.&nbsp; But then I met Paul and Eleanor. And for once I thought that I hasd my life set. But then that all feel apart. I was kicked out and then everything feel apart again. But then my gusardian angels fell from heaven. They feel into my life and they are the best thing to ever happen to me. They saved my life in every&nbsp; way possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are my family forever and they will never leave my llife and I will never leave them. I still feel out of place at times&nbsp; and that is okay because it is slowly going away.&nbsp; I love Cherie and Mom and they are my family forever.&nbsp; They are my ervything.

"event","I found out something awful last night and it upsets me greatly. I have discovered that I have extreme damage done to my body. I feel like crying and I don't know what to do. I have to go and see a doctor but I can't see my family doctor because she has lied to me and has already tried to kill me once with medication that hasn't been given out for the last twenty years becasue it was taken off the market becasue it was proven fatal and I was on a fatal dose. But besides that she has had to know about my problem and she won't do anything about it. And I am scared. I always knew that there was something wrong but I never figured it was as bad as it is. All I will say is that I have over 36 scars and I have about 6 rips that make it painful for me to do certain things. ANd it is all thanks to my fucking father. I hate him. I wish that I could have him killed he ruined my life and I will never be the same again. He destroyed me and I can never get away from what he did. I feel so empty inside and I feel like I am broken and can never be fixed. I have spent many hours crying over this and I don't know what to do . I know that I have to see a doctor&nbsp; but I am scared to go because I don't think they can do anytrhing except maybe reconstructive surgery but then I don't want surgery. ANd I am terrified. If anybody wants to know more then call me or message me and I will explain."

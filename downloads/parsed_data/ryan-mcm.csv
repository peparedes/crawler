Just now i am on the comp at half 12 in the afternoon  i should be at school but ""oh mum i am soo sick"".. he he worked a charm.

so this week has been ok not the best or anything. At night this week has been cool though because one i saw the crow which is one fucking good movie,  then i saw donnie darko twice (i like it that much.. its like a film that leaves you sitting back in the room thinking WOW!!) and to top of my nights during the week gary ""sexy ass"" ross has been phoning me and having cool conversations about stuff like how fucking good a friendship we have which is always good to have and people like gary only come around once or twice in your life so you need those people. Anyway i better change the subject before getting all emotional..lol jk. 

My pc is literally fucked it turns on some days then some days it doesnt its soo fucking weird  and the days it does come on i do not trust it.

Well tonights pip's would be on but  it isnt due to...ummmmmmmmm.things. I would have really enjoyed a party tonight but ah what the hay.

Tomorow should be a good day , gonna go to glasgow with gary and james etc... i wont be spending much though i am sincerely skint i need a job soo badly but i duno were to go or try.
Already this week i have tryed halfords and ""cough cough orrs cough cough"". The reason for hiding the fact i applied there is if i get it i would need to wear a suit and that is just not my thing.

Anyway thats enough writing for today.

"event","So were do i begin reallly on friday i went to the capelside gig it was quite gd apart from the fucking ""reebok farm boys"" they were so shit, the guy was like come down the front and go mental ........... why? not to his really shit lyrics anyway and then when knowone was coming to the front he would jump off the stage and tery to save the day with his fuckers of over exagerated solos. But apart from them it was quite gd.

Then on saturday me and gary headed down to old philip's house and cleaned out his garage and then got our guitars in and begun to fuck about and play some shit , but the truth to be told we were not getting anywhere it was just not really working. We need to be in a really creative mood or something.

AH sunday at last shall i say it was the best day of my life, went to the chili peppers oh my god they were fuckin amazing i fucking loved it , they played some new material, phoned johnny ramone, played absolute amazing and just made me feel fucking excellent, i felt like i was in fucking wonderland excellenty.

and the past few days have been ok really just the usual shit."

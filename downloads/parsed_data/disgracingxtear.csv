try to ignore the changes in my voice when my eyes start to water

close my eyes
and pretend this isnt happening.
pretend i never loved you.

pretend i never lost you

pretend you never lost me

pretend you were never there to begin with.

i guess sometimes i wish i didnt care
just so i could stand by your side <i>smiling</i>.


youll neglect to realize this is even about you
that youre the only person who matters enough to ever make me cry
its sad
youre the person who i yearn to be closest to
and the one who needs to stay the farthest away

i wish i could keep pretending you dont matter
that i could stop writing this now

i dont want you knowing how i <s>love</s> you
its better left unsaid
it was never enough to make you want to change
<b>i</b> was never enough to make you want to stay.

what id give to wish you away and <i>for once</i> say it with sincerity.



if only i wasnt still shaking from all the pain you kissed away

((.i love the circle we spin, where kisses burn holes only you can fill.))

im the only one left broken by this
im the one who forgot how to love

i want to be able to love you
to look you in the eyes and let myself melt again
im too tired to hold myself up simply so i wont fall down at your feet
i hate myself for missing 
a dream we never lived up to

most of all 
i hate that youll never change
not because you arent strong enough
but because you're too happy to see the need
i wish you would give anything for me
and want this the way i did

i wish <i>just once</i> i could lay in your arms
and not feel my heart pulling out of my chest
running away because thats all i can ever do.
i hate feeling that fear only love can burn
knowing the only consequence of floating 
is crashing to the ground
that 
much
harder

most of all


i hate how the only cure for a broken heart
is falling in love with you all over again.


my eyes will always sparkle 
my heart will always melt
and i will <b>always</b> miss you.

at this point he seems pretty much perfect, and as everyone tells me, hes exactly what i need right now...

but last night i realized for the first time in awhile that im not over it. 

its not love.. im not even sure if its like.. all i know is that i still care.. i still miss it.. and i still worry. hell always be amazing, his hearts just not in the right place anymore, i guess it never was to begin with. it just kills me sometimes.. knowing everything weve been through, and that we couldnt be farther apart. and knowing even more that it has to stay that way. he will always be incredible, its so hard seeing him throw it all away. i hate knowing that i wasnt enough to change him... that if we could have been different, everything would have been perfect.. but its not, and i am over us.. im over waiting on someone who will never love me enough.. and killing myself over someone who will never change.


my life is officially perfect. i can honestly say i wouldnt change a thing.

i want to sleepover at logs tonight. not work. 


those nights you kept me warm...
id hold my breath just to hear you sleep."

"event","Yesterday while I was at soccer practice, my dad got something in his eye, and his eye got all swolen! The entire eye got bigger except fot the black part and then the blue part of his eye. It looked like a pot hole in the road just turned vertically.... To get the something out of dad's eye, mom had to lick his eye. LITERALLY! I couldn't do it, because I'm squeemish, or how ever you say it, so mom did it. I felt bad though because dad would lick my eye if i got something in it, but i couldn't lick his eye.... :(

The eye is still a little bit puffy but it got a whole of a lot better!


Happy news! My brother got a 99 on his history test! He had the best grade out of 250 other college students! Me is happy for Davo.

I have a hangnail, and its killing me! I ripped it off, and it just hurt even more..... 

eghhh! The two pimples on my chin will not go away! I use Cleocin T to make it go away, and it says on the bottle label to use it like twice a day, and i ended up using in like four times today... ooops. who cares?!

Going to the mall with Gabby and Jane on either Saturday of Sunday..... Sunday most likely because Jane and I have a soccer game at somepoint. Luckily its in town though.! YAY!

Mr. Currie was telling us about the candy that was stolen from the band hall. The candy was meant for the early-bird peoples.... I WANT MY CANDY!

I know who the theives are, but i'm not mean, so i'm not going to post them. AREN'T I A SWEET PERSON?!?!


I heard that La**y is on Fire '92.... Classics are sooo much better even though that he is on Fire 92... I heard that there were two teams.... Fernando said that La**y stinks at soccer... oh well! That means that if i ever play him, for some odd, random, unlikely reason, i get too kick his but! That would be amusing and fun!


well, Aissa and I are the council of the circle! muahaha! Jeremy is the Vice President, and Moe is president! YAY!


ha. this is funny!
I was talking to my mom and suddenly i say, ""dude, i gotta pee!""
Mom: ""ok... thanks for telling me...?""
""Any time""



Anyways, This is the conclusion of our program..."

I shall elaboriate:

The best Four get into Region Band.

Then the Next Best Nine get into Zone Band

I was one away from getting into Zone Band. You do the math to see where I ranked....


..........................


Sometimes  my dad is too harsh.

Like Today, Dad picked me up from the band hall, as we were walking to the car, Dad's like ""So how'd u do?"" 
I say, "" I got one away from Zone Band.""
""Zone Band""
So I explained to him what that means.
""Why'd you get that score?""
""Nervousness""
And here's the harsh part: ""Taylor! You gotta quit with this Nervousness crap!"" (mean, huh?!"")
So... I walk to the car without an expression on my face.
""Taylor, don't look @ me like that.""
""Dad, I didn't do anything!!!!""
He looks at me, and gets in the drivers seat.
He tells me something, but I wasn't paying attention... something to do with being happy with my score...
""Dad, I'm fine with my score...""

eghhh... Fathers can be rough around the edges....... 


Going to Office Max Later today.... YAY!"

on Friday I got my Green Low-tops! They're awesome, but they didn't have any arches, so my dad got me some. Now my feet feel so much better when I wear them... haha, my parents were a bit freaked about Hot Topic when we went in to get the holy green shoes, even though they won't admit it...

Day afterwards, I drove to Corpus Crispy( HAHA! Jane, it CHRISTI, not CRISPY! :) )
Then I went to Cheesy Janes because i was stinkin' hungee, and i saw Katie Bartlett there. I feel sorry for her because someone smacked her in the nose with a volleyball, and the cartolage in her nose got bent. OUCH! Afterwards, Dad and Idid one of those ""self-wash"" kinda car-washes. it was sooo much fun! The car was sparkly clean! 

Today, I woke up at 8:38 am, had a smoothie for break-fast, and then shoveled mulch (luckily it was wood chippings, and not cow-crap) into a wheel-barrow, then spread the mulch in the gardeny spot in the front yard. Now I know how bugs and such keep warm. I took my shoes off and slid my feet to the bottom of the mulch pile. It's like an oven at the bottom!

I have to practice for like an hour on saxophone because:

1) i only have like 40 min. in.
2) first gi-normous concert tomorrow(10/18/2004) GO AND SEE IT!






nothing else to say... GO A&M!

OMG, the last time that I went to the mall we had so much fun. We went to Foleys, and just grabbed random clothing from the racks, and tried them on! LOL We didn't put them back on the hangers, and left them in a ginormous pile.  We slipped out stealthily........ haha. that was cheesy. We ran out of Foleys frantically. We felt sorry for the people who had to re-hang the clothing and stick them on the clothing racks.... 

We bought like a pounds worth of candy each. it rocked.Jane and Gabby went to the cookie factory, or whatever, and they got like humungo slices of cookie. the slices were bigger than pizza slices.

I bought a shirt at WeTsEAL. i love it. its comfy.
It has a tiger on it. its kinda wierd. i went to the mall like 2 weeks ago, and now i'm talking about it. Or maybe i did talk about it, and i just don't remember that i wrote about it earlier. who cares?........


Alex thinks that i'm wierd. i'm perfectly fine with that.

Erin thinks that I spazz too much. that's ok too..... i don't think that i spazz alot though.... do i?? IM me for the answer.....

"event","[glow c=FF99FF s=8][font s=7][shadow c=66CCFF  s=9]Today, i don't know. I mean, my friend who ????HAD/HAS??? a crush on me, and then he told me that he got a girlfriend, so  i'm like, ""Good for you, Zach!"" being happy for him because he's a good friend of mine. So, then i realize, that he only liked me because of my looks so i'm thinking 'OMG, he's Shallow!' and get really mad at him for treating me like that, only liking me for my looks. But i know that he's a really good friend, or was? i guess... I don't know, and like he is a really good friend of mine, but i don't know if we should be friends, because he like lied to me, (i'm thinking because he says he has a girlfriend, and i don't believe him) and oh well.... i'll talk later.[/glow][/font][/shadow]"

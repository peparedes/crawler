Lisa is the bestest friend ever! I dunno what i would do without her through all of this!! I love her to death and she means everything to me.. She is a true friend!!
Peace Easy"

"event","Well i havent had the best weekend at all. In fact it was horrible!! i found out that my dad is dying and that is very hard to deal with and then hank almost broke up with me.. That was the hardest of all. He means so much to me and i dont want to lose him ever. He is the best and means so much to me. Just one day with him makes everything better!! He is the most kind hearted caring person i know besides lis and i thank him for that!!

Lis is the best through all this. She is there for me through all of this and she listens and is more like a sister to me than anything else! I dunno what i would do with out her!!"

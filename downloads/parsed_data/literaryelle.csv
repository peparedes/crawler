"event","Well I won't be around much.  Turns out HP was aware of huge issue with my laptop model that results in it becoming one giant paperweight.  Of course I don't discover said issue until 2 years after warranty ends.  So I'm left with choice $400 to repair lappy (a fix according some internet forums doesn't work forever) or saving up to replace it with an IPAD or something else. 

Its just so frustrating.  Now I have to beg, borrow or steal computer time from my Mom and Brother, both of whom are students.  So I probably won't be around as much because they're usually on theirs when I'm home and not sure what I can/should access from work.  I looked forward to using my laptop after my 1-2 hour commute home depending on traffic and now its gone.  To console myself I bought another writing book this ones full of exercises so I can apply what I'm learning.  Only now I have to write by hand.  Boy now I'm just depressing myself more.

"event","Thank Goodness It's Payday!  Mom watched a PBS special, wanted to buy the book so we went to both Borders and Barnes & Noble to find it.  Glad we checked both because she found it for 30% off which meant I didn't have to feel guilty about the two writing books I picked up for myself.  

One is called ""Story Structure Architect: A writer's guide to building dramatic situations & compelling characters."" The other sounds promising in other ways ""Breathing Life Into Your Characters: How to give your characters emotional & psychological depth.""  In re-reading some of my favorite stories I've noticed they are ones that have strong characters and story development.  In looking at my own work I can see those along with planning are not my strongest suits.  So I'm reading up to see if I can improve those areas and others.

Watched the uncut version of ""Quigley Down Under"" there were a bunch of scenes that they cut or edited that really added to the story so it made more sense. A good reminder that less isn't always best."

"event","I'm so sorry I haven't posted in ages, but things have been very hectic in real life.  Since Christmas my Grandmother had surgery for breast cancer, I fell and gave myself a concussion, changed jobs, crashed into a garbage truck (I was fine, car got repaired), lost my steering belt (part not fixed in crash repairs, learned a couple of computer programs, totally revamped our student hospitals/clinic process and had open house to tell the colleges we work with and that's just the highlights.  So I been really busy, but then I got this fabulous card from Jen.  Thanks Jen you reminded me how much I missed my lj & csi friends, missed writing and reading.  So when I was at the library yesterday I snagged some books on writing and editing.

I want to share with you the opening from Jill Jepson's ""Writing as a Sacred Path"" which really reminded me of why I love/miss writing.

""If you are reading this book, you have already heard the call.  Maybe, at this point, it's just a whisper, a small voice quietly urging you to put your ideas into words...Or perhaps the voice is more insistent.  Characters appear full-blown in our consciousness, complete with faces and bodies, histories and dreams.  It isn't so much that you've thought the characters up as they have arrived uninvited.  You wake up to find them sitting at the foot of your bed saying, ""Well?  Have you given us substance yet?""  You long to put is all down on paper.  You have to tell their stories....This impulse (writing) may sound like masochism or addiction, and perhaps it is, but it is also something greater and more compelling: it's a vocation, a calling.""

During my new extended commute (35-90 minutes depending on Bay Area traffic) I heard the voices of my old posted and unwritten stories calling.  My goal is to find times and ways to give them voice again.  Part of that will involve reading the book above during lunch because she reminded me why I need to write and why I love reading what the rest of you write.  Now I'm off to read your recent posts!"

"event","There are a number of reasons for my silence the last few months and all of them are related to a single, dreaded 4-letter word.  WORK... Basically each month there has been some time consuming project that has sucked the life out of me so that when I finally got home most days I came home, ate dinner and went to sleep.  When work was quiet, then family stuff picked up; the upside is mom has finally got to know things about her father and meet some of his other kids.  This of course has lead to more family drama.  I'm still recovering from some bug picked up from work, which is one of the bad things about working in a hospital.  So this is just a brief note to anyone who might be &quot;listening&quot; to let you know I'm alive and working on GSR stories when time allows.  TTFN"

"event","It's funny how different people look at their birthdays, two of my well-meaning co-workers kept trying to let the rest of the staff know that today was my birthday.&nbsp; I think they felt bad because it got lost in the shuffle of the Nurse whose last day was today.&nbsp; I think they thought maybe I was just being overly humble, but I was grateful not to be the center of the attention.&nbsp; However, I am very grateful to those who took the time to wish me &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot;

Things are finally getting less frantic at work.&nbsp; I probably haven't mentioned it, but I work in a Hospital and we've spent the last four months gearing up to move to electronic medical records.&nbsp; Which is very exciting and really fantastic for patient care, but following so close after losing the department's director its put a lot more work on my shoulders so after spending 8-10 hours at work most of the time I just couldn't face more time on the computer which is why I've been absent for so long.

Anyway its late, I just wanted to pop in and say &quot;Hey I'm still alive.&quot;&nbsp;"

"event","<lj user=""mingsmommy""/>'s reply made me realize that I've been pretty quiet about what's been happening so I'll take a few minutes to bring you up to date.&nbsp; Since the old department Director left my role at work has changed drastically, I went from being just clerical support to having input on how the department functions.&nbsp; Our department is active in many aspects of hospital administration, but because the old Director kept us in the dark we didn't really get to interact with hospital leadership.&nbsp; Now, however, we're slowly navigating uncharted waters.&nbsp; Our Assistant Director is still very new, she's only been with the company and California for 10 months so part of my job is to explain how to succeed in our corporate environment so I've become one of the leaders in our department.&nbsp; Part of what makes this so hard is that the hospital leadership has been working on ways to improve how our hospital performs to better serve our members.&nbsp; In many ways this is exciting because we're trying new things, but change in an unsettled environment can be exhausting, so some of us end up working harder and longer to smooth things over.<br /><br />At least my personal life has been pretty quiet.&nbsp; Nothing is happening in my love life (which may be a good thing) though my brother's spending more and more time with his girlfriend.&nbsp; My health is okay except for the bad cold I had last week and I'm grateful Mom's still not showing too many affects from her strokes though she's excited about finding a new sister.&nbsp; <br /><br />She has the strangest family story, I won't bore you with all the details, but long story short her father was kind of a bigamist.&nbsp; How can you be kind of a bigamist you ask, well you have wedding ceremonies and marriages, but neglect to file all the paperwork.&nbsp; A couple months before her first stroke Mom posted a question on Yahoo! Answers looking for assistance in tracking her father down.&nbsp; A very nice person gave us the genealogy info they'd found.&nbsp; It wasn't until the following July that she found the response posted the month after her stroke from her half-brother Bill.&nbsp; The result was the discovery that she had new brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, cousins and info about that side of the family.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fast forward to the other day and Mom's opening an e-mail from a new long lost sister who no one seems to have known about who knows more about that side of the family because she was close to her father's sister.&nbsp; Interestingly enough this is an aunt and couple of uncles that Bill didn't know about.&nbsp; She also knows about a wife and more siblings who were in Washington (Bill is in Nevada).&nbsp; So I do a little digging on some websites and found new listings for my grandfather in posted marriage, divorce and birth certificate census lists which gave us more previously unknown wives and another lost sister who was born in Texas.&nbsp; We're pretty sure its the same guy because his middle name isn't that common and when Mom talks to her new siblings too many details match up.&nbsp; So on that front the saga continues.<br /><br />As for the writing, well I'm still having trouble getting more than two paragraphs down at a time.&nbsp; It's kind of this weird block.&nbsp; In the past I used to kind of &quot;hear&quot; my stories, the way the words flowed.&nbsp; I think though things on that front are getting better because I've been getting new inspiration for old and new stories and been hearing pieces of the story. Just the other morning I was driving and heard a section for When the Evidence Lies which will take that story in a new direction, found a couple of songs that are revitalizing both Sara's Little Diversion and some of the ones I've worked on but not posted.<br /><br />I guess the answer to your question <a href=""http://mingsmommy.livejournal.com/profile""><img height=""17"" width=""17"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" alt=""[info]"" src=""http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://mingsmommy.livejournal.com/""><b>mingsmommy</b></a> is that I'm hanging in there and things are getting better every day.&nbsp; I hope you all can say the same thing.<br />"

"event","So Mom turned over to this new show on ABC called The Unusuals.  I love it!  It's like &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; meets &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; this is not your average cop show.  This cops are sarcastic with realistic characters and real foibles, yet the cases are interesting.  If you're looking for something to watch instead of CSI:NY or Law and Order give this show a try.  A show hasn't caught my attention this quickly since CSI premiered.<br /><br />Edited 04/09/09 to add show info I found while looking at the <lj comm=""ysileftovers""/>&nbsp;a community that has introduced me through recs to music and tv shows I didn't know about and would've missed out on.&nbsp; Most recently it introduced me to the Fox Network tv show &quot;Dollhouse&quot;<br /><br /><b>Show:</b> <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1240976/"" class=""snap_shots"">The Unusuals</a>, 2009<br /><b>Network:</b> ABC<br /><b>Genre(s):</b> Drama <br /><br /><b>Starring:</b> Amber Tamblyn, Jeremy Renner, Harold Perrineau, Joshua Close, Monique Gabriela Curnen, Kai Lennox, Terry Kinney, Adam Goldberg<br /><br /><b>Summary:</b> Like a modern-day &quot;M*A*S*H,&quot; &quot;The Unusuals&quot; explores both the grounded drama and comic insanity of the world of New York City police detectives, where every cop has a secret. It also helps to have a twisted sense of humor, since every day could be your last.<br /><br />Detective Casey Shraeger (Amber Tamblyn) has just been transferred to the NYPD's Homicide unit from Vice and is instantly thrown into a setting of bullets and bodies. As she begins her new assignment, Casey finds that the squad is full of secrets, which serves her well, since she's keeping a few of her own. &quot;The Unusuals&quot; premieres WEDNESDAY, APRIL 8 (10:02-11:00 p.m., ET), on the ABC Television Network.<br /><br />"

Her last day was Thursday, so for the last month I've been trying to support her as she prepped to leave and assisting the woman who is replacing her in getting settled.&nbsp; The good news is my job is secure, my evaluation was okay and I work a lot better with the new boss.&nbsp; Already this change is reducing my stress and writer's block.

The other exciting but more recent change was I upgraded my phone, since Verizon was doing the blackberry buy one, get one free deal I bought blackberry storm's for my brother and I.&nbsp; Its a big change from my old phone, but there are some pluses I'm looking forward too.&nbsp; I'm trying to get better connected so I've started a twitter account in the hope I can update LJ more often.&nbsp; If anyone has any suggestions or tips I'd be grateful for the help.&nbsp; Switching from a regular phone to a blackberry is a bigger change than I bargained for.

"event","So I disappeared for the summer without a word to anyone because life kept throwing me curve balls.&nbsp; It started June 1st during our team meeting where I was informed that because one of our locations was closing on weekends and a person was leaving for nursing school that I was not going to be able to increase my hours.&nbsp; This was a huge blow, I've been needing more than 24 hours a week since Mom lost her job because of the stroke, but haven't gotten it so have been robbing Peter to pay Paul and cutting corners where I could just to eek by.&nbsp; The San Francisco Bay Area is a frightfully expensive place to live and I've been under tons of stress just trying to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.&nbsp; My response to that was to inform my boss and co-workers that I would be looking for a new job and would take the first one offered to me.&nbsp; Since I work every weekend and they'd have to divide those amongst themselves I thought this was the right thing to do.&nbsp; Apparently no one took me seriously.

During the summer I worked 40 hours a week, covering vacations, yet still managed 1-2 interviews a week.&nbsp; The job search was pretty discouraging because each position had 75-100 applicants, but since I was an internal candidate with loads of experience I kept being included as they whittled the pool down to a manageable 10-20 to interview.&nbsp; Not the best odds, but I believe that the Universe places us where we need to be at the right time so we can do what needs to be done.&nbsp; 

Anyway so I am busy doing the job hunting when my brother announces he's gotten in at the last moment into an out of state wilderness EMT program.&nbsp; Basically we had to help him prep for a 6-week course in Colorado with a 1-week camping survival component in just a few days.&nbsp; You might be wondering why he couldn't do it all himself, well that's because he was in the middle of studying for his Chemistry summer school class final at the same time.&nbsp; Then just to complicate the matter my Mom's younger brother announces since he can't get a job in California as a teacher, he's accepted a position in Colorado and needs our help with the move.&nbsp; While my brother needed us just to follow up on his to do list, my uncle needed mom and me to help him a lot more including helping clean his apartment.&nbsp; Let's just say I'm glad I've watched so much &quot;How Clean Is Your House?&quot; on BBC America because it was a horrible mess.&nbsp; It was rough, because we drove two hours north to help, cleaned all day and left at 10pm that night so I could be at work at 5am the next day.

A lot of other stuff happened, none of it terribly interesting so I'll just skip to the more recent stuff.&nbsp; Michael came back a certified W-EMT and is now considering a slight change to his education plans instead of Med school he wants to become a Flight RN.&nbsp; I'm supportive of that because I always worried about his ability to handle a patient's death.&nbsp; My brother's a libra and a sensitive guy, he's the sort that feels things deeply, but is also the strong silent type who doesn't share easily.&nbsp; I remember how hard each death has hit him and had concerns that being responsible for someone's care who died would be devastating.

My uncle in Colorado seems to be alright, though we haven't heard much from him since Mom shared what happened as a result of her posting and answering on yahoo answers.&nbsp; Basically long story short, my Grandma fell in love with a man and married him.&nbsp; It was only later that she discovered from her mother that a) the marriage wasn't valid and b) she wasn't the only wife he had in the area.&nbsp; Apparently my great grandmother didn't give her much choice and threw him out of the house with a verbal thrashing.&nbsp; For the last few years as Mom and I have been trying to learn more about the man, neither of us quite believing the stories and family gossip which made him out to be just slightly less worse than the devil.&nbsp; We've pieced together a different picture of the love story, but wondered what happened to him afterword.&nbsp; So Mom decided to post a message asking for help on yahoo answers last year, but it wasn't until recently that she went back and found someone searching for her as a result of that post.&nbsp; It was a younger half-brother, Bill, who filled in the gaps with e-mails and phone calls.&nbsp; We're going to try and do a reunion soon since Mom now has six siblings she's never met.&nbsp; Anyway, David still believes the negative stories he's grown up with and I think feels Mom has betrayed Grandma so hasn't talked to her since she mentioned Bill and the others.

Mom has good days and bad days, after the last two trips to the ER, one of which resulted in an over night stay it looks like she's had a couple of small strokes called TIA's.&nbsp; Most folks wouldn't notice the changes, but I noticed that her smile is off on one side and she struggles with stuff more than in the past.&nbsp; So the hospital visit did have a good aspect, she met with Occupational and Speech therapists who did some tests and have proof that while Mom is still highly functioning the strokes have caused deficits and altered her thinking.&nbsp; She's going to start rehabilitative therapy and they seemed very postive, but its made us all realize that she'll probably never live on her own again.&nbsp; 

The other day someone asked when I was going to have babies and without thinking I said that I had a baby she was just 50 years old.&nbsp; Its not exactly a fair thing to say because Mom and I watch out for each other, but it shows that at a certain level I've accepted responsibility as her caretaker.&nbsp; I've watched others deal with caretaking, but&nbsp; never realized how much it hurts to realize that your parent isn't there to make everything better anymore.&nbsp; All my life I could depend on my Mom to make everything better, even if it was just talking things out.&nbsp; She's still here and I'm grateful for that, but now its my job to make things better for her.

Which is why I accepted the first job that offered, why I'm balancing two jobs until my transfer goes through on the 26th and why I decided against the two other jobs that were in the process of making an offer.&nbsp; Instead of taking a manager or supervisor position I took an Administrative Assistant job working for a director in the hospital which should be less stress even though it's further up the corporate food chain since my boss reports directly to the head of the hospital and meets frequently with one of the Vice President's.&nbsp; I borrowed my brother's Macy's card and found a great new wardrobe on the clearance racks, but at the same time I've gotten slim enough to wear some of the things I've been carting around for six years.&nbsp; Mom keep teasing me about being a fashinonista because I'm wearing make-up and something more stylish than my birks and jeans, but I know she's proud.&nbsp; 

Between the pills and watching my fat intake I've lost two almost three sizes up top, have gone down from a 46 KK to a 44 II bra and have made some real changes to my lifestyle.&nbsp; Just last week I shocked her by taking a slider roast beef sandwich (4 g fat with mayo and the new hawaiian slider rolls), a salad with fat-free dressing and newton's apple fruit crisp (2.5 g fat which tastes a lot like a low fat version of mcdonald's apple pies).&nbsp; I love veggies but never cared for salad, yet here I was taking it voluntarily.&nbsp; 

In some ways its like I've been doing my own version of Tim Gunn's Guide to Style show, I started by massively overhauling my wardrobe gone is anything that made me look fat, like the baggy t-shirts that hid my shape.&nbsp; They've been replaced by clothes that show I have a waist, legs and breasts.&nbsp; Have ditched my birkenstocks most of the time in favor of ballet flats and Dr. Scholls pumps.&nbsp; I am enjoying my new short haircut and wear bare minerals makeup everyday.&nbsp; I feel like a totally different person than the one who went to that meeting in June.&nbsp; As everything has begun settling down, I've found more time for writing and am really looking forward to NaNoWriMo this year."

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"">[1] Do you have the guts to answer these questions and re-post as The Controversial Survey?<br /> Sure why not.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I owe you something interesting to read after my long absence.<p class=""MsoNormal"">[</p></p><lj-cut><p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">02] Would you do meth if it was legal?<br /> No, but mostly that&rsquo;s because I have enough issues with legal meds like Benadryl and Dayquil<br /> <br /> [03] Abortion: for or against it?<br /> I&rsquo;m pro-choice and believe that each person has the right to choose how they feel about the issue.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>For the first time in history women truly have control over their bodies and the power to decide their futures.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Which means it is up to the individual to decide how that power is applied and what steps they take to either prevent or accommodate unplanned pregnancy.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Someone close to me had an abortion many years ago for very good reasons, yet even all these years later she looks at kids who would be the same age as the fetus she terminated and wonders &ldquo;what if.&rdquo;<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>She feels the ache of emotional ramifications she hadn&rsquo;t considered when making her choice.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>My personal philosophy however is best summed up by a quote from the movie &ldquo;War Games&rdquo; where the computer after playing out all possible outcomes for Global Thermonuclear War says &ldquo;The only winning move is not to play.&rdquo;</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">[04] Do you think the world would fail with a female US president?<br /> I think we need a female President for several reasons, but the top one being that someone needs to start placing a priority on the problems at home with our children, seniors, poor, sick, and destitute.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it seems that the politicians are so focused on the world, that they are myopic and miss our everyday struggles. <br /> <br /> [05] Do you believe in the death penalty?<br /> I have concerns about it. <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>In California it costs the taxpayers more to go through the mandatory appeal process prior to execution; then it would to support an inmate for life.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve seen enough stories of wrongfully convicted persons on death row to be concerned about the possibility of killing an innocent person.<br /> <br /> [06] Do you wish marijuana would be legalized already?<br /> It&rsquo;s legal in California and there seem to be pros and cons to it, but having heard first hand stories of people who use it to treat debilitating pain those issues seem to be minor compared to the good it can do when properly used. <br /> <br /> [07] Are you for or against premarital sex?<br /> Marriage doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a commitment as it did centuries ago, since nearly 50% of heterosexual marriages ending in divorce.<span style="""">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do think society would be better if people waited for some type of commitment before sex, maybe Maury, Montel and Jerry Springer could do fewer shows on women <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>searching for their babies&rsquo; daddies.<br /> <br /> [08] Do you believe in God?<br /> I do believe, there are too many wondrous things in the Universe not to.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Over the years I&rsquo;ve explored many faiths and have found that their definitions regarding the who, what and why of God were too limited for my preferences. <br /> <br /> [09] Do you think same sex marriage should be legalized?<br /> Considering that statistically same sex relationships having better odds of lasting long term, I believe they deserve the same rights and benefits.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>I have a friend who will be marrying her partner in October under California&rsquo;s law allowing same sex marriages.<br /> <br /> [10] Do you think it's wrong that so many immigrants are moving into the country?<br /> My family immigrated to America some in the 1600s and some more recently.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span><br /> <br /> [11] A twelve year old girl has a baby, should she keep it?<br /> That&rsquo;s a question for the girl and her family to answer.<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>My choice might be different than theirs, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it the right one.<br /> <br /> [12] Should the alcohol age be increased to 21?<br /> That&rsquo;s what it is in California and I&rsquo;m okay with it.</p>  <p class=""MsoNormal"">[13] Should the war in Iraq be called off?<br /> If not now, then when?<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Do we wait months, years or decades to leave?<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>Mostly <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>I wonder if we&rsquo;re truly accomplishing a lasting change and will we look back and still feel its worth the cost.<br /> <br /> [14] Assisted suicide is illegal: do you agree?<br /> I think it should be legal to make a choice to die, that way standards can be applied to ensure all options have been explored and the person can die with dignity, peace and comfort.<br /> <br /> [15] Do you believe in spanking your children?<br /> Does spanking teach children violence?<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>My mother chose to avoid physical correction, choosing instead to instill the philosophy that all life is sacred and precious, to treat others as you want to be treated, and <span style="""">&nbsp;</span>to spread love, joy and kindness.<br /> <br /> [16] Would you burn your countries flag for a million dollars?<br /> Burning the flag is the correct etiquette for dealing with flags that have been damaged or dishonored, so I find it less offensive than those who don&rsquo;t show proper respect for flag etiquette by leaving them out in the rain, letting them get tattered or discolored. <br /> <br /> [17] Who do you think would make a better US president? McCain or Obama?<br /> I have grave concerns about both candidates.<br /> <br /> [18] What is the biggest problem with society that needs to be dealt with?<br /> Lack of respect for ourselves, each other and the world.<br /> <br /> [19] Are you afraid others will judge you from reading some of your answers?<br /> We are only promised the freedom of choice, not that those choices be universally liked, respected or accepted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br style="""" /> <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--></lj-cut><br style="""" /> <!--[endif]--></meta></meta></meta></meta></meta></meta></meta></meta>"

"event","<p>I got the results back and apparently the results of both the EEGs and MRI were normal.&nbsp; Not sure what the Doctor will tell me on Thursday, but at least I don't have a brain tumor or something equally scary.&nbsp; I suspect I'll get the same speech I got last year about how it will go away on its own or maybe he'll tell me to keep taking the meds (according to one pharm site they don't know how it works, just that it does treat pain and epilepsy).&nbsp; I'm still having the electric shocks, though not as many and the med side effects are finally (after 4 weeks) are going away too.&nbsp; I actually drove myself to and from work last week, which I haven't done in weeks because of the lack of co-ordination and dizziness.&nbsp; Poor Mom's had to get up at 5am to drive me in.</p>  <p>So I've been kinda depressed because at the last couple of Doctor's visits I haven't seen any weight loss or there's weight gain on the scale.&nbsp; Yet I have been noticing a difference in my clothes (a little odd since no exercise, just trying to keep fat about 20g per day).&nbsp; It started with a couple of shirts that used to be skin tight being comfy and then loose, I've been able to steal some of Mom's clothes and wear some of my smaller 2X (18-20) stuff.&nbsp; </p>  <p>Which was why I cleared the closet and donated to charity of all the stuff I was wearing last summer (3X and 4X).&nbsp; I made myself try on everything including the stuff I've been carting around for 6 years on the chance I might someday be able to wear it again.&nbsp; Before learning about PCOS I didn't really have much hope of ever fitting into them.&nbsp; So I was shocked when I tried them and found they were just a little bit tight.&nbsp; About this same time I informed my boss and co-workers in our team meeting that I would accept the first job I was offered.&nbsp; I wanted to warn them because they'll probably have to go from working every 3rd to every other weekend to cover my shifts.&nbsp; </p>  <p>Anyway last week I needed an interview outfit and decided to try on my favorite black suit pants and blue silk blouse just to see if they might fit.&nbsp; They did and when paired with my black 3"" slings I felt like I'd had a Tim Gunn makeover.&nbsp; I felt ab fab; tall (the shoes put me close to 5'7""), glowing with youth &amp; vitality (bare essentials is great makeup) and more like myself than I have in ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>  <p>They're gonna make a decision later this week and I have a good shot since one of the managers works closely with my old boss.&nbsp; Plus the job combines bits from every job I've done in the company including the excel spreadsheets with pivot tables I designed.&nbsp; So I'm really qualified, but even if I don't get it I'm not worried because I got calls yesterday to schedule an interview for next week and another letting me know they'll be calling later this week to schedule an interview.&nbsp; I'm not the only one with job news.&nbsp; Mom got called in for an interview for today (her first since the stroke).&nbsp; I'm really hoping she gets it because I think it will help her take the next step in recovering.&nbsp; My brother just got hired for his college's emergency services department, its only 10 hours a week, but he's really looking forward to it.&nbsp; It feels really great after weeks of stressing over how to pay the bills to finally have some good news.</p>  <p>The interview next week is for the job I really, really want because it would mean a $5 an hour raise and if i ended up on swing or graves its even more $$, it includes a uniform allowance (so no more thinking about what to wear to work), similar benefits so I only lose 8 days of time off per year and I would actually be working in the same field as the degree I'm working on.&nbsp; The only downside is that unlike the others it means leaving the company I've been with for 11 years.&nbsp; In some ways the company has been very good to me, but I really think its time to try something new.&nbsp; So I'm keeping my fingers crossed.</p>  <p>There is also good news on the writing front.&nbsp; I located the flash drive with all my writing and story notes so I can resume editting and writing my WIPs (its been missing for a month, but I've had other things on my mind).&nbsp; I was feeling so good the last two days that I actually got some writing done.&nbsp; I'm not quite ready to post anything yet, but at least the story that I've been thinking about doing since Goodbye and Goodluck is finally off to a good start its suppose to be a case file with hints about Sara's ghosts, I also worked on some other unposted stuff and am debating editting and reposting some of my WIPs.&nbsp; That idea became more appealing after I got this rude review on ffnet for When the Evidence Lies.&nbsp; The review said ""Okay, that's it. I'm done with this. Do you realize it's been 16 months since you updated. The least you could do is post that the story is on hiatus. From now on, when and if I read stories on this list, they better say ""complete,"" or I won't be bothering. Can you really think anyone will take you seriously after you do this?""&nbsp; My initial impulse which was to just delete When the Evidence Lies once and for all; some days that story seems like more trouble than its worth.&nbsp; Instead I posted on YTDAW's Reader's and Writer's Rant thread and I'm following the advice I got and let the snarky comment roll off my back.&nbsp; </p>  Also I have found a novel series that might be of interest; its not too new, but I'd never heard of it until I found it in the library.&nbsp; Its from various authors writing under the name Alex Archer and called Rogue Angel.&nbsp; Without giving away the plot its kinda like Witchblade meets Lara Croft.&nbsp; The heroine is interesting and the writers apparently watch the same documentaries I do because the archaeology stuff was both familiar and pretty accurate.&nbsp; I finished the first book ""Destiny"" and have checked out the next three, though according to Wikipedia there are a bunch published and like 10 more coming."

"event","This has been an interesting week filled with various health tests.&nbsp; Last Friday I was seen by the Doctor because I developed a muscle spasm in my left arm, finally calling for an appointment after if had been twitching and jumping for 36 hours.&nbsp; The result was predictable, the Doc has no clue, would like to run some more tests (see if my electralights were balanced) and offered me a muscle relaxing med to see if it would help.&nbsp; I agreed to the tests, but skipped the meds.&nbsp; I have more than enough chemicals in my system for now without adding more to the cocktail.&nbsp; The spasm eventually went away on its own the following Sunday.<br /><br />I woke up with a migraine on Monday, but rather than call in sick decided to work remote from home and face the potential fall out from that later.&nbsp; I ended up being able to complete my shift, especially after taking a nap for my lunch hour.&nbsp; I also mentioned to a co-worker my frustration at the system and got her side of the story on why she can work from home when she wants.&nbsp; She was shocked to hear that I was still ""sick,"" apparently I haven't been complaining about it enough, but I don't see any point troubling them when i have no solid information.&nbsp; She did begin to see the seriousness of it when I mentioned that I was undergoing 2 EEGs and an MRI this week.&nbsp; <br /><br /><img width=""203"" height=""165"" align=""right"" src=""http://www.uams.edu/today/101801/epilepsy.jpg"" alt="""" />So the title is a reference to those procedures.&nbsp; The EEGs weren't too bad they use this cold jelly like glue to attach electrodes all over your head and a few on your face.&nbsp; The test is designed to monitor my brain waves both awake and asleep, which was followed up by the audio and visual eeg tests, basically I listened to a series of clicks or watched a screen of dancing squares and apparently the waves and spikes recorded will tell my neurologist what's going on.&nbsp; <br /><br /><img width=""193"" height=""157"" align=""left"" src=""http://www.southeasthospital.com/cancer/IMAGES/mri.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />The MRI I took today should also help with the diagnosis, which is what I kept telling myself through out the most hellish procedure ever.&nbsp; First off I should explain that I am not a skinny person, at best I'm Rubensque with a large bust and with my existing claustrophobia they had to put me in the open MRI machine, the regular one would have been a squeeze.&nbsp; So because they were doing a brain scan they had to put this ""cage"" on.&nbsp; Boy that was tough like having my own version of Man in The Iron Mask moment.&nbsp; Luckily between relaxation techniques and medications I managed to get through the experience; it was tough by the end I was panicked, crying and desperately wanted to stop, but was determined to make it through.<br /><br />I wonder what the results will say since I had episodes of the tingling and shocks during the tests, my hope it will clarify things for the doctor, but I don't see him until July 10th.&nbsp; In the meantime I'm patiently taking my medications though each time I pray that the side effects will be better and basically keeping my chin up.&nbsp; It helped that a few days ago I saw part of a Montel Williams show which was talking about improving your health.&nbsp; I've been reminding myself that he took his MS diagnosis and used it to create a better, healthier life.&nbsp; I still don't know what the docs are considering beyond epilepsy, though the eeg tech made a couple comments in passing about how the MRI would check for myelin sheath degeneration.&nbsp; At this point all I can do is wait for what the Doctor has to say.<br /><br />Today when my fear was so overwhelming a voice whispered in my mind, perhaps my brain pulling out a quote to help, whatever it was the reminder I needed and I'm employing it each time thoughts and fear of what this could be occur.<br /><br /><dl><dd><i>I must not fear.</i></dd><dd><i>Fear is the mind-killer.</i></dd><dd><i>Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.</i></dd><dd><i>I will face my fear.</i></dd><dd><i>I will permit it to pass over me and through me.</i></dd><dd><i>And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.</i></dd><dd><i>Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.</i></dd><dd><i>Only I will remain.</i></dd><dt><span style=""font-style: italic;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear</span></dt></dl><br /><font color=""#0000ff""><b><br /></b></font>"

"event","So the visit with the Neurologist went fairly well.&nbsp; I now know that what's happening is not in my imagination.&nbsp; One of my co-workers jokingly suggested I was a hypochondriac when the symptoms first started.&nbsp; However it seems serious enough now that the doctor's order another round of blood tests, 2 EEGs (one will test visual &amp; audio input), an MRI, a nerve conduction test and a new medication that I should be able to take while working.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were parts that didn't go so well like some of the reflex tests, I barely felt it when he used the tool to tap different places and when I couldn't feel the vibrating instrument as much as I should have.&nbsp; I'm scared of the MRI test because I'm already kinda claustrophobic and mom got really claustrophobic after hers.&nbsp; I'm also torn for being glad that he marked the epilepsy box as the reason for the MRI and a fear (probably the result of watching too much House) of finding out it is something worse.&nbsp; My Dad had brain tumors when he was young, my cousin had juvenile onset of huntington's, mom had a stroke and my maternal grandmother and both paternal aunts had cancer (2 had breast cancer and 1 had leukemia).

When I got home I did a little research on the tests, epilepsy and my meds hoping that having information would make me feel better, that whole knowledge is power idea.&nbsp; I'm trying not to psych myself out and it worked for a while; I remembered that there are so many more worse illnesses to have like cancer or MS or parkinsen's (the list goes on of course) which aren't as successfully treated with a pill. 

That feeling lasted until I spoke with my Supervisor by phone.&nbsp; When we talked on Friday she made a point that I should communicate with her more and not try to resolve things on my own.&nbsp; Keeping that in mind I decided to give her a heads up&nbsp; to mention that since the side effects of the med causes drowsiness, lack of coordination and dizziness among other things that the med literature seemed to be recommending not to drive and that I was planning to work my shifts remotely from home.&nbsp; 

I was shocked when she basically pointed out that if I couldn't drive then I probably couldn't do my job.&nbsp; My job requires me to use a mouse to select staff who are on the phones, use a drop down menu to chose their new setting and watch what's happening to the incoming calls to our call center.&nbsp; So I guess moving a mouse is exactly like driving a 2700 lb vehicle :-P 

Anyway I was gobsmacked, because that was not the reaction I expected. &nbsp; I thought she might be understanding (maybe sympathetic) or at least content that I was making an effort to communicate with her.&nbsp; Instead she left me feeling like my job was in jeopardy because I'm taking meds which have some serious side effects but might stop the electric shocks and jerks.&nbsp; It was just another stress/ frustration/ hurt I could have done without today.&nbsp; 

She did however manage to make me feel even worse when she proceeded to inform me that her supervisor who initially said that our project should work from home as often as possible, changed his mind and now says we can now only work from home when necessary (like my office being closed) or for emergency coverage.&nbsp; It seems strange to me to invest all that money in equipment for me to only use 2 days a week.&nbsp; But there was no point arguing, so instead I'll drive to work tomorrow using extreme caution (I had problems when I drove Monday) and work from the office because its what they want.&nbsp; She knew I'd agree since I can't risk my job since I'm the sole provider for my family of 3. Mom hasn't found a new job, I'll keep looking with my company for another job and my brother is busy finishing up his med school requirements.

She also said she might be driving here on Thursday to do an on-site inspection of my work station and do a ergo evaluation since she's leaving on the 13th for a 5-week archaeological internship.&nbsp; I'm just not sure if things will be better or worse while she's away while one of my co-worker's and her supervisor are covering her absence.

In the mean time I'm trying to think good thoughts, study for my classes and just have faith that everything happens for a reason.&nbsp;"

"event","It's been a while since I've posted because I've been dealing with a bunch of stuff in real life and it reduced the amount of extra time I had.&nbsp; One of the changes I've been dealing with are the on-going health issues.&nbsp; It has been frustrating to say the least because just as my elbow injury seemed to be finally healing and I began working on a new story a new problem crept up.&nbsp; It started one Friday morning as I was driving to work, an intense pain like someone had stuck a cattle prod behind my left knee.&nbsp; Since it only happened once I went on like normal, but over the next couple of days it happened with more frequency.&nbsp; It wasn't just this shooting pain striking various parts of my body that finally had me seek out the weekend clinic it was the addition of a tingling, itchy, creepy crawly feeling like bugs crawling up my skin and the appearance of several veiny bruises where the worst of the shock pain had been.&nbsp; So the doctor arranged a consult appointment with neurology and prescribed a pill, its used for neuropathy and pain, but at first the side effects from it were worse than the symptoms; after it put me to sleep I would wake up feeling like I had the flu, a migraine and had been beaten.&nbsp; During my post clinic follow-up visit to my doctor she told me I was a little anemic and my red blood cells were a little small.&nbsp; She agreed with the clinic doctor that a visit to neurology was a good idea and ordered more detailed blood tests about the anemia. &nbsp; Didn't get the results back yet, but started taking a multi-vitamin which should help if the anemia is caused by iron, B6, B12 or vitamin E deficiency.

Well the neurology consult is today at 9am and I'm really looking forward to it.&nbsp; I had one last year for the ongoing numbness and tingling I was feeling so I know what to expect.&nbsp; He'll push, prod and poke me with pins, but I'd really like a better answer than what I got last year (it will go away on its own).&nbsp; Because yesterday I had the most embarrassing day at work.&nbsp; I'm hoping its because of the medication and not something worse, but long story short I had set down my mug of tea had a muscle jerk and sent it flying into the keyboard and cpu.&nbsp; It was so embarrassing having to call IT and have them come up and deal with the dead keyboard and cpu.&nbsp; What's worse is I debated looking for the lid for the mug that morning but chose not too because I was already running really late for work.&nbsp; Anyway, things seem to be getting better a little bit at a time, so that gives me hope.

The other major change that's been filling up my time and causing loads of stress is that my building is no longer open on weekends, but I still work every weekend.&nbsp; I knew I was going to be guaranteed my regular hours, but oh the stress of not knowing.&nbsp; Anyway the company finally agreed that my department could do a test program with us working from home.&nbsp; So now I've joined the ranks of tele-commuters (just in time as even the cheap local gas is rising to over $4.35 a gallon) and while I do like it the hassle of getting there was rough.&nbsp; I had to make room in my small apartment for another office space because of the equipment they sent home, basically a full computer workstation sans desk and chair.&nbsp; The ergo guy at work is looking into how they can get me a chair.&nbsp; The prep work at home has involved a lot of spring cleaning and clearing clutter including going through boxes still unpacked from the move in 2004.&nbsp; 

Much of the apartment looks like an episode of clean house before they cleaned it up, but others are quite organized, so its a work in progress.&nbsp; One fabulous thing that came out of the decluttering was I went through my closet and tried on all my clothes getting rid of the too big, way too small and unwearable.&nbsp; During that process I discovered I could wear my old interview suit and am back to the size I was 6 years ago.&nbsp; This is fantastic news because it means I have this great Macy's working wardrobe I bought with my yearly bonus all those years ago once I drop a couple more pounds.&nbsp; 

Needless to say I've gotten re-energized about exercising and eating right.&nbsp; Mom's got us on a very low fat diet only about 20g of fat per day.&nbsp; That number is based on Dr. Dean Ornish's book ""Reversing Heart Disease"" where he's had remarkable results with patients with severe heart disease and blockages.&nbsp; The pictures from the before and after angiograms are amazing.&nbsp; We aren't really doing it for heart disease, but because our doctor told mom to get her cholesterol down to 70 because of the stroke.&nbsp; Ours was pretty good before Mom was 153 and I was 168 so I think its a realistic target.&nbsp; It has been interesting reading labels, which has lead to different choices and some great discoveries.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the best discoveries is Hebrew National's 98% fat free hot dogs, which my brother loves because they taste just like a full fat beef hot dog, but eating 2 of them is healthier than 1 regular hot dog.&nbsp;&nbsp; To go with that discovery was Bush's Vegetarian baked beans which are fat free.&nbsp; Finally my last two fav discoveries came as I looked for a replacement for soda, I've been soda free for most of the last six months.&nbsp; So in looking through through all the drink sections I found Kern's Horchata in Albertson's fridge section and Numi's in the tea section.&nbsp; Horchata is a Mexican drink  a combo of milk, sugar, water, rice flour and spices.&nbsp; Its a little like egg nog, but really refreshing when paired with tacos, burritos, quesadillas and enchiladas.&nbsp; As a California native I eat lots of Mexican food so the store bought Horchata is a little luxury.&nbsp; My other indulgence is a sorta expensive tea.&nbsp; I've fallen in love with Numi's Decaf Black Vanilla tea and Golden Chai tea, both are worth the extra expense and if you like a hint of exotic Indian cuisine you'll love these too.

So lots of changes, but I'll try to spend more time on the journal in the future; though that may vary since I'm picking up tons of extra shifts for work and taking 2 summer school classes.&nbsp; TTFN"

"event","So in an effort to keep myself entertained without causing more elbow pain I've been reading in the hopes that it will help when I can write.&nbsp; Anyway I read this great book called ""Keeping It Real"" by Justina Robson which is not only well written, but has a unique pov.&nbsp; Basically the story is about a future Earth where an explosion has created rifts between our technological reality and the magical ones for Elves, Fairies, Demons and Elementals.&nbsp; It combines the best of sci fi and fantasy, so I had to share it with ya.

The injury has been acting up more than usual this week so I've had to limit my activities even more, but I wanted to let you know I appreciate all the well wishes even if I can't respond to them individually yet.&nbsp;"

"event","A year ago I noticed that the pain I experienced when I moused or typed at work was unbearable and went to employee health and filed a worker's comp claim.&nbsp; Since then I've been through braces, splints, physical therapy, acupuncture, pain medication and a cortizone injuection only to wind up pretty much back at the same place I started from.&nbsp; Not only can I not write, but I had to withdraw from my classes which stinks because I was really enjoying the web building and photoshop stuff, but it just proved to be too much on top of work.

I think the cruelest thing to do to a writer is to take away their ability to write, I know it could be worse and I'm thankful for that but it is really frustrating being unable to type or write by hand the stories in my head.&nbsp; There are stories there I want to explore, journeys I want to take and feelings to explore, but I think it means I'll have to better manage the time my hands and elbows don't hurt.

Right now that will mean dividing my time between writing, reading and job searching.&nbsp; Work has recently become another source of frustration, its been decided to close my facility down on weekends (2 of the 3 days I work) and transfer our workload to our sister sites.&nbsp; Its a good plan for the company, it improves our efficiency and all that.&nbsp; The problem is that I'm not a ""local"" employee because my position manages all three sites either locally or remotely.&nbsp; So my jobs not going away, but no one has answered the question about what happens to me and my co-workers now.&nbsp; I'm hoping the rumors about getting us a work laptop and cell phone are true, because it means I could work from home which I kinda like.&nbsp; Just in case I'm looking at job alternatives, because Mom may not be able to return to work like we thought.

There have been a couple of times recently when she remembers an event that happened in the last couple weeks differently than it happened.&nbsp; We're still trying to determine if they were just flukes or a sign of a bigger problem, that maybe there are more long-term issues from the stroke than we first thought.&nbsp; I still count us lucky, but want to know what changes we need to make to accommodate it."

"event","So I've been off the last few days and with the exception of my photoshop homework, helping my brother with his&nbsp; and working on a new fanfic I've been very lazy.&nbsp; This is of course no real interest to anyone, but I hope the details about them are.<br /><br />I'll start with my brother's homework, it was for his forensic evidence class and was really kinda cool.&nbsp; We had to set up a crime scene, photograph the evidence and display it.&nbsp; Basically my job was to help and watch the scene while he did the mid and long range locater shots.&nbsp; So we went to the park after watching Cold Case files and American Justice to set up the scene.&nbsp; We did two different ones so he could chose which ones looked best.&nbsp; The first one was sorta a party gone wild thing with beer cans, fast food napkins, and keys snagged on a tree.&nbsp; The second was a kidnap from a vehicle doors open and signs of struggle.&nbsp; I can't wait to take this class.<br /><br />But I'm also enjoying my photoshop class I've done a bunch of additional duotone pics to come up with one to submit.&nbsp; Mom thinks I'm being too picky, but I want to do well in this class because when I'm done I'll be going through this photoshop for forensic investigators and checking out options for more training and certification in it.&nbsp; If I get either the job I'm interviewing for next week or the one I take the test for on Friday I'm considering doing an online program run by one of the forensic certification organizations.&nbsp; Its not exactly the subfield I wanted to get into, but at least it would be closer than where I'm at now.<br /><br />Finally for the new fanfic, its not exactly a new plot, its one I've been thinking of doing for a while now, but last night I finally ""knew"" how to start it, the problem I'm having now is that its being written in first person a style I usually avoid, but am now wondering if its because of a hold-over&nbsp; perception from school that it was easier than some of the others and not as literary.&nbsp; I'm watching Romancing the Stone and the voice over for the novel shows it was written 1st person from Sara's pov.&nbsp; So I think I'm being over sensitive, though I'm not sure when or even if it will get posted because I'd rather have most of it done rather than starting yet another wip.&nbsp; But at the same time I want reader input because the story will be an interesting inter-play of case file, personal reflection and GSR.&nbsp; Part of the premise is based on Shakespeare's quote...A rose by any other name...The question raised by the story is whether that's true for a person.&nbsp; Maybe once I'm done with this first chapter I'll have made a few decisions about the style and whether to post or hold until more chapters are finished.<br /><br />Below is the one I'm thinking of submitting for homework tomorrow.&nbsp; We can't use copyrighted images so GSR isn't an option yet.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/literaryelle/pic/0000t0g1/""><img width=""240"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/literaryelle/pic/0000t0g1/s320x240"" /></a>"

"event","So since my last post I have been hard at work dividing my time between computer classes, writing, job searching and working.&nbsp; I've found that I'm enjoying my web XHTML coding and Dreamweaver classes, the act of inputting code is relaxing.&nbsp; Photoshop has been dull, its all that boring duh stuff.&nbsp; Though I created my first composite duotone image for homework this week, but think I'll try and due another one to submit.&nbsp; I'm not satisfied with the image, but overall I'm pleased with it. <br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/literaryelle/pic/0000sda9/""><img width=""320"" height=""211"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/literaryelle/pic/0000sda9/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /> For everyone like me who loves Girl Scout Thin Mints, but needs to eat healthier I've found a wonderful alternative.&nbsp; Quaker has chocolatey mint mini delight rice cakes.&nbsp; The little bite sized rice cakes are drizzled with chocolatey mint icing and a snack sized bag only has 90 calories.&nbsp; A tastey treat that doesn't wreck my efforts to lose the extra weight.<br /><br />Valentine's Day is nearly over and I was pleased to see the many posts for Smut-a-thon, though I think I'm feeling a little sad because I miss writing and interacting with others like others do with their betas.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is probably just the result of missing a week's worth of writing chats because of homework.&nbsp; So I'm off work the next few days, trying to get ahead on homework because I have a job interview coming up and want to be prepared in case I actually get the job.&nbsp; Its something I really need because right now we're looking forward to mom's tax return to pay the rent and get through another month.&nbsp; I've worked what extra hours I can, but the on-call member of our staff beat me to most of them.&nbsp; I'm considering trying the temp agencies and applying to jobs with a longer commute.&nbsp;"

"event","The problem with taking a bunch of computer classes is the prep work that goes into them all the stupid little steps like making sure you have the right version of free software and media players.&nbsp; I'm glad I've gotten almost everything together because it means I can start working on homework tomorrow.&nbsp; Since I work Friday, Saturday and Sunday I need to get as much done tomorrow as possible so I'm not in a bad situation Sunday night trying to finish everything up.

The onehour2write chat tonight&nbsp; was an interesting discussion about betas and concrit.&nbsp; I didn't say much, mostly listened because I'm guilty of posting stories with stupid errors because I choose not to use a beta.&nbsp; But I have also been very grateful for the readers who take the time to point out those mistakes.&nbsp; I don't usually mention it to my readers, but because of a learning disability I couldn't read until I was nearly 9.&nbsp; The school teachers wanted to push me into the special ed school because they didn't have the resources to help.&nbsp; My mom paid for a bunch of special testing to prove to them that I wasn't stupid.&nbsp; Basically the report convinced them that while I didn't have a well known disability like dyslexia, my family was more than willing to step up.&nbsp; In the end I was pulled out of school and home schooled.&nbsp; I was very lucky to have my Grandma who started off teaching in a one room school house handle my education for that year.&nbsp; Her patience and willingness to find the technique that worked for me.&nbsp; When I went back to school for 4th grade the new school had to test me for placement, they proved that I was reading and doing math way above grade level.&nbsp; Even with that improvement I still struggle with things, especially when I'm tired or don't take things slow enough.&nbsp; Thank goodness for grammar and spell check.

Instead of actually working on a new piece during chat, I ended up looking at When The Evidence Lies and discovered big holes, lets call them leaps in the story, that I wanted filled.&nbsp; Since starting the revision process was effective at jump starting my last update for SLD, I'm hoping it will be effective here.&nbsp; I'm going to check out the ffnet help file tomorrow to find out if I can edit or replace the chapters without losing the reviews.&nbsp; If I can't then I'll just post the revised stories on a personal site.&nbsp; My goal for this semester since I'm taking web design and photoshop is to build a personal website with graphics to house my fics.&nbsp; I'm not sure what it will look like, but I know I like aspects of several existing ones like Cincoflex's, LSI's and grissomsararomance.com&nbsp; Its only a goal so we'll see what happens, but I'm hoping to actually apply what I know.&nbsp; Its late and I'm tired, but dread going to bed, knowing tomorrow will be another long day."

"event","Mom was watching the local news, it gave another reason for the writer's strke to end - Bush needs their help with his speeches apparently the state of the union was like a bad rerun of recent speeches.

So today was the first day of school, I'm a little worried that I've gotten myself in over my head.&nbsp; (Not a big surprise, I seem to do that every time.)&nbsp; While I was eating dinner I finally got a glimpse into how the next chapter of WEL could start.&nbsp; I wrote it down, but had to focus on school for the time so I'll try and get some time in the morning.&nbsp; The one bad thing about my classes is the Wednesday night chat, I'm hoping it doesn't conflict with the chat/writing times Jen already set up; after having such a great first outing I hope to keep it up.&nbsp; 

Last night I watched Billie Piper in ""Mansfield Park"" and whoever wrote that screenplay needs to be taped to a chair, gagged and forced to listen to someone read Jane Austen's book over and over again.&nbsp; I suppose if I'd never read the book or watched any of the other versions I might have enjoyed it, but given my knowledge I hated it.&nbsp; In the end Mom and I agreed to finish watching it just to see the outcome.&nbsp; It was like watching an accident scene, the inconsistencies, the cultural errors and the like.&nbsp; So I was really disappointed because the Persuasion adaptation while not strictly adhering to the book was at least enjoyable.

The one great piece of news today is Mom and I drove downtown to take my brother to lunch between classes.&nbsp; I drove us there, but when it came time to find a parking space Mom suggested that I pull over and let her drive.&nbsp; Which I did of course since this is the first time since the stroke where she's wanted too.&nbsp; It went well though only lasted like 10 minutes, but still its more progress.&nbsp; 

At lunch we went to Quiznos a place I've only been to once before so I got a little adventurous and ordered the flat bread chopped salad with roasted chicken and honey-dijon vinegrette.&nbsp; It was okay, except the bacon was like under cooked and cold, so I picked it out,&nbsp; but other than that pretty good though the portion was big enough so I could have it for dinner as well.&nbsp; That fairly healthy decision was followed by shopping where I managed to adhere to mom's new dietary restrictions (doctor wants her cholesterol under 100) while resisting temptation.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point I've managed to cut out all soda, reduce my sugar, fat and salt intake.&nbsp; When I went to the Doctor twice in one week a few weeks ago I had lost&nbsp; like three pounds between Monday and Friday.&nbsp; Which takes my weight loss since August up to like 45 pounds, still a long way to go, but with exercise and these dietary changes it should grow.&nbsp; Part of Mom's tactics to keep me on the band wagon includes watching ""You Are What You Eat"" on BBC America each day.&nbsp; Seeing the gross way they show folks eating and present the food pretty well grosses me out and keeps me on track."

"event","Just a quick note to squee about the 1hourtowrite chat.&nbsp; I was hoping that the chat would help me get something done, but I wasn't prepared for a great success.&nbsp; I actually began work on the first chapter of the sequel to Water Hazard, its 2 pages long about 800 words so I'm really thrilled to finally be seeing some progress on this since I've been meaning to write it for more than a year.&nbsp; I haven't forgotten the requests to finish my other stories.&nbsp; I'm re-reading When the Evidence Lies in the hope of rekindling thoughts about that one, right now Sara's Little Diversion is on a couple days break while I let the next chapter percolate.&nbsp; Anyway props to Jen for creating that community and I'm looking forward to seeing what more I can churn out.

Nothing much to report on the home front, except that I completely destroyed and rebuilt my school schedule (again) and am taking 12 units of digital media studies so in the future you may see my attempts at photoshop, web design and stuff.&nbsp; I think this is mostly just a break, but I found a neat program at UC Berkeley that deals with aspects of human-computer interface.&nbsp; So one part of my mine is pointing out that I could have my phd in this faster than getting my law degree, but I don't have to decide today thank goodness, but I'm thinking of applying for one of google's internships anyway to try and expand my resume and hire-ability.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; For now I'm off to watch Mansfield Park with Billie Piper on Masterpiece Theatre.&nbsp; Its funny I couldn't watch the season premieres of Dr. Who or Torchwood but I watched a movie yesterday with Christopher Eccleson and Billie Piper today.&nbsp; Seeing the Doctor and Rose in other roles is great.&nbsp; I'll probably watch BBC's supernatural Saturday on the dvr in the next couple days, but with school starting tomorrow not sure what my homework schedule will look like yet."

"event","So I took the exam for the position I want this morning.&nbsp; There were about 40 others talking it and I think I did really well except for two little questions.&nbsp; We had to read a statement and determine if any spelling errors; well I had a bit of a headache and messed up on the words receive and conceive.&nbsp; Gosh I missed spell check so much.&nbsp; As some of my readers who have read some of my unbeta'd stories know my spelling and grammar can be a trifle spotty which is why I'm much better at being a sounding board for ideas.&nbsp; 

Speaking of ideas, I'm debating my next chapter of Sara's Little Diversion, what I started writing last night sorta just skips over Sara &amp; Grissom telling the team, but I'm wondering if that's a cop out.&nbsp; I'm torn between the desire to finish the darn thing or not cheat the readers out of the full story.&nbsp; After getting 9 really nice reviews from the last chapter I'm trying to figure out what would be the best way to handle the next chapter.&nbsp; Maybe inspiration will strike."

"event","I haven't updated because I have been battling depression, basically I've been in fight or flight mode since Christmas Eve.&nbsp; Mom's condition hasn't gotten any worse really except she's still not driving, rarely leaves the house and still has issues with recent technology like text messaging, cable remote and e-mail.&nbsp; Since she lost her job I've been faced with the fact that we can't survive long on my salary and that my plans for the spring semester have to be changed.&nbsp; Honestly those are the two primary reasons I've been down and escaping reality at every turn through reading fanfic and television.&nbsp; I was really looking forward to being a regular college student attending classes on campus, instead I had to switch back to a strictly online program which limits my choices.&nbsp; After failing to turn in any coursework for the fall intersession classes I'm starting to rethink my course load which currently is mostly about photoshop, web building and a Justice work experience class.&nbsp; I'm just worried I'll be too depressed to do well.&nbsp; As for the money situation I'm applying for full time jobs and tomorrow go for the test for a police clerk job, if I do well on it and the interview I might be working in the jail in a few months which at least is closer to my field than working for a healthcare company's call center is.<br /><br />I do seem to be coming out of the depression a little bit because I was finally able to do two things I've wanted to do since New Year's.&nbsp; The first was to post a new prompt on GSR Drabbles.&nbsp; I'm hoping that at least some of the members are still interested and we can give it a go again.&nbsp; The other accomplishment is that I posted an update to Sara's Little Diversion.&nbsp; It took me ages to figure out what was wrong with it and in the end I'm sure it could be better, but I like that it isn't too fluffy, angsty or predictable.&nbsp; I joined the <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/1hour2write/profile""><img width=""16"" height=""16"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/1hour2write/""><b>1hour2write</b></a></div>&nbsp;community hoping to force myself back into writing more regularly.&nbsp; When I first wrote fanfic I wrote at least 20 mins a day and want to get back to that even if its just posting a quick note here."

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Hard Candy Christmas angsty explanation""><br />As I was cooking dinner for Mom and I tonight, I was thinking about the latest news from her Doctor and what seems to be our family's Christmas Curse.&nbsp; While watching the Best Little Whorehouse with Mom, I found the lyrics to this song very appropriate.&nbsp; You see my Great Grandfather died of a heart attack when he was like 49 and his funeral was Christmas Eve.&nbsp; When my Grandmother was 51 she was told at Christmas that her Breast Cancer was terminal and she wouldn't last more than 6 months.&nbsp; She died like 19 years later, but that first Christmas without her was the beginning of more than two decades of hard Christmases.&nbsp; <br /><br />It started in 1985 when my cousin Adrienne who was 6 years older than me was diagnosed with juvenile onset of Huntington's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time I didn't understand the full tragedy of the disease, but as the years passed I learned.&nbsp; Especially at the end when Adrienne was like a newborn, except for brief moments when you could see the 27 year old woman who understood, but was trapped in a body that wouldn't respond.&nbsp; The next year Grandma died, finally losing her battle with cancer.&nbsp; Those horrible years were followed by 7 more of living with an alcoholic who introduced us to the tradition of flying Christmas trees.&nbsp; <br /><br />Basically when he was drunk, something or someone would tick him off and he'd declare there would be no holiday.&nbsp;&nbsp; At which point he grabbed the fully decorated tree and chucked it through the open door.&nbsp; Many treasures were lost in the early years including some of the ornaments my Great Grandmother brought West as a bride.<br /><br />When we finally were able to escape him, the Christmases afterwards were more like the ones of my childhood where because she was a single parent we were just trying to make it through, but were never really joyful.&nbsp; We were finally getting that joy back when about six years ago my brother's Grandfather committed suicide.&nbsp; The next year Mom last her job so that was followed by more struggling to make ends meet.&nbsp; When three years ago I took a new job which meant moving over the holiday season.&nbsp; I was down here alone in an apartment with no stove or furnace.&nbsp; It was gloomy being here alone with little heat, light and hot water, while Mom and Michael finished packing and moving.&nbsp; So that was a depressing holiday.&nbsp; That move in some ways was a bad one, because it created money and living situation problems.&nbsp; It's taken Mom all this time to finally get hired, which is why I was really looking forward to having a nice one this year since Mom had the new job, but then she had a stroke.&nbsp; But I was okay with it because I considered her good luck with the stroke my Christmas miracle and the best present ever.</div><br />When Mom was talking to her Doctor today about extending her time off work, because she is still easily exhausted, sometimes can't remember her phone number and still hasn't driven.&nbsp; The Doctor scheduled an appointment for an MRI, apparently they spotted ""something"" on the last CT scan and want to check it out.&nbsp; This news on top of Mom's fears about money and losing her job, have once again put a damper on the idea of Christmas.&nbsp; I've volunteered for more shifts at work and am already looking at ways to replace the income lost when I reduced my work hours to go to school.&nbsp; We've got the disability paperwork filled out, just need the new Doctor's note and hopefully that will help.&nbsp; Goodness knows something has to change, I'm back to where I was a decade ago and having migraines practically daily, but work through it when possible.&nbsp; I'm trying to not stress, but it seems like as soon as I get a handle on one issue two more arise.&nbsp; I'm now struggling with trying to predict the future (will Mom be able to return to work?), plan a school schedule when life is uncertain and stay on top of things.<br /><br />I was at a low point on Saturday, my head hurt and work had been difficult; when I began flipping through the new issue of my writing magazine.&nbsp; There was an article about writer's block, I didn't read the whole thing, but one point lept off the page at me.&nbsp; The author was talking about how after a separation from the story, you have to woo it back.&nbsp; I put the idea into practice and managed to jot down 2 pages of a new chapter for Sara's Little Diversion.&nbsp; I'd like to finish that one, so I can better focus on newing WIPs.<br /><br />Thank you for your continuing support both personally and as writing mentors/supporters.&nbsp; When my reality feels overwhelming I turn back to my stories and the stories of others for a brief escape.&nbsp; Thank you so much for everything."

"event","I didn't have time to turn on the computer while Mom was in ICU, but after about a dozen different tests including Cat Scans, MRI's, and ultrasounds of heart and carotid artery the Doctor's let Mom come home.&nbsp; Which is a double blessing because not only does it reduce my stress in half, it also allows us to make sure she can eat properly because the problem with hospital food is that it's not designed to feed someone with allergies like hers.&nbsp; She lost at least 5-10 lbs in the last couple days because the shirt we bought a couple weeks ago just hung on her frame.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, Mom's happy (kinda) about the weight loss, but not so happy about the pills she has to take for blood pressure and her bad LDL which is only 150 thank goodness and we already follow a pretty low fat, low salt diet so no big changes on that front.

Mom's off for the next couple weeks to recover, and I already had time off thru the 15th, but my brother starts winter break then so he'll be around to help her out.&nbsp; We got really lucky with this bleed, it hasn't really affected her she still has total cognitive and motor functions.&nbsp; She has a little difficulty with more recent skills like text messaging, but it seems to be coming back quickly.&nbsp; Its so funny when she was in the hospital I did a lot of caring for her, simple stuff like cutting up her chicken breast, helping her out of the hospital bed and the like.&nbsp; Yet she's home like 2 hours and is already back to normal right down to making crustless pumpkin pie.&nbsp; It puts me in this odd position and I realize how hard it is now for parents to let the kids do stuff on their own.&nbsp; I wanted to tell her to relax, but then I realized that getting back to her routine and being active was the best therapy for her.&nbsp; Still hard to step back.

Thank you everyone who offered their support, best wishes, prayers and so forth.&nbsp; I really think it helped more than I can say because on Wednesday the Doctors' were concerned that she'd need neurosurgery to relieve pressure, but by the next evening much of that concern was toned down.&nbsp; I may take up all offers of support because being the eldest I've been appointed barracuda for dealing with Mom's supervisor and HR rep who basically stressed Mom out enough in the first place to have the stroke and who in the first 36 hours already implied that Mom's job and benefits were in jeopardy because she's only completed the first month of her seven month probation and training.&nbsp; During the 4 years I worked in my company's call center staffing department I learned a bit about California and Federal employment laws.&nbsp; I have a to do list for Monday which includes calling her Union Rep and the manager in charge of reasonable accommodations for help I think I might need reinforcements to remind Mom's supervisor of what she can and can't do in this situation.

I'm still stressed and rather irritated because I was actually getting some writing done before this all happened and it felt good.&nbsp; I haven't been able to write more than a sentence or two in the last 6 weeks because my department lost 3 employees so I had to work extra shifts instead of working on NaNoMo like I wanted.&nbsp; Then my brother had girl problems apparently a lot of interesting stuff came out after he broke up with last girlfriend and the other girl he's been hanging out with got some crazy notion that they've been dating.&nbsp; That stuff finally gets handle and then its Mom's health which triggered my post-traumatic stress disorder and brought all my brother's stuff about his grandfather's suicide because the 4th anniversary was yesterday.&nbsp; I just wish life would be as simple as it was when I started writing fan fic so I could finally finish the ones out there, start posting the couple I want to be working on especially the sequel to Water Hazard because I finally know how to start that one.

Well there's always tomorrow right.&nbsp; Anyway thank you again to everyone who has been supportive both during this health crisis and before that the wonderful folks who've asked about the pending stories.&nbsp; I haven't responded yet, but haven't forgotten you or the stories either."

"event","That seems the only way to describe today.&nbsp; It started off like any other, but then my Mom called and she didn't sound quite right; it was easily explained away she'd been crying, was stressed and very emotional.&nbsp; It was the subsequent calls that had my brother and I driving to her office.&nbsp; She told us she was feeling odd and having difficulty with simple things like she couldn't remember how to text message; this was extremely odd since she'd taken to text messaging like a duck to water and I get at least 5-50 from her a day depending on what's up.&nbsp; So we took her to the emergency room -- 4 hours and a bunch of tests later the doctor informs us the CT shows bleeding in her brain.&nbsp; For a family where strokes are common, it wasn't a total surprise, but I didn't expect for my mom to have one at only 50 years old.&nbsp; We spent most of the last 7 hours at the hospital getting her admitted.&nbsp; It was terrible having to leave her in ICU.&nbsp; I'm not terrified for her health because in my heart I know she'll be fine because bleeding strokes don't cause the same kind of damage as clotting strokes.&nbsp; Its just that while my brother and I have both spent the night away from home, Mom never has she's always been there to hold down the fort.&nbsp; I'm too tired to explain it right, but basically today was frightening because of the role reversal, the fear that the stroke would take away some part of my mom and difficult because I have to be the emotional support for both mom and my brother Michael, but also the contact to decide things if she can't.&nbsp; It's also hard to see your Mom as frail, confused and lost.&nbsp; 

Tomorrow's gonna be a long day another CT should show if the bleed is growing or not, which will lead to a neurological consult about whether they need to do surgery.&nbsp; I keep reminding myself to take it one step at a time and breathe, but it didn't help much I've still got a nasty migraine headache.&nbsp; With any luck tomorrow will be better."

"event","This has been the week from H E double hockey sticks and I pray this next week is better.&nbsp; Basically I just tanked one of my mid-terms because I didn't realize it was due tonight and then when I did it my hands hurt so keying the short essay responses and selecting multiple choice answers hurt, since I'm not a spring chicken I can't remember everything I've read in the last 6 weeks and so on.&nbsp; This is the second time I've taken this stupid geography class in the last two years trying to get a passing grade and I'm annoyed as all get out.&nbsp; Part of the reason I had trouble studying was because of the stuff going on at home and at work.&nbsp; At home my 14 year old tabby was terrified for days after her first earthquake and kept insisting on being as close as possible this week regardless of what book, papers or laptop I was working with.&nbsp; At work there's even more disruption as the co-worker I was complaining about in recent posts accepted a team manager position and continued to give me the silent treatment.&nbsp; Thank goodness I only have one more shift with him, but in the meantime he's making comments that are subtle digs against me and others.&nbsp; Another rough patch this week is two-fold, my sleep apnea is acting up which has resulted in issues in getting up and being at work at 530am which is a truly unholy hour.&nbsp; So after a full day's work and a commute by bus I'm exhausted and feel flu-ish with no desire to write NaNoWri or work on my homework.&nbsp; The bad thing is I now have to finish writing and researching two 5-page papers, one on Scott Peterson's trial and the other on Jon Benet's case.&nbsp; I spose it could be worse, my poor professor has to read papers on those topics from everyone in the classes, but since she assigned it I guess the punishment fits the crime.

I've had some wonderful reviews recently on Sara's Little Diversion and Water Hazard so I'm pulling out my wip chapters and want to post something soon.&nbsp; I'm thinking that I'll have more writing time since I talked to my boss about dropping down to 3 days per week as part of this transition process.&nbsp; She's very open to it and looks like its really gonna happen, I'm scared about losing $300+ a pay period but with mom working it shouldn't be a real problem its just I've worked 32+ hours a week since I graduated from high school.&nbsp; But being off Monday thru Thursday will let me take college classes that aren't just online ones.

The other bit that made this week icky was watching the CSI ep which was one of the worst I've ever seen.&nbsp; I was bored, kept wishing they'd kill off Ronnie and waiting for it to be something other than the Cath is sexy show because the lines written for Brass were pretty bland and that little scene between tech and Grissom seemed thrown in there for the heck of it.&nbsp; I'm worried that this ep is an indicator of how bad the eps may get without JF.

Well I'm off to bed in the hopes that tomorrow will be the start of a better day and week.&nbsp;"

"event","For anyone who is wondering yes I felt the 5.6 earthquake center in San Jose, the epicenter is like 10 miles from the house.&nbsp; We had just started watching Torchwood on BBC American when we heard a loud rumble like a semi truck idling, a pop and suddenly the whole house is shifting about 4 feet to the left.&nbsp; So Mom and I got out of the house worried about the stability of the apartment.&nbsp; We're back and just kinda waiting for the remaining aftershocks to finish hitting.&nbsp; It reminded me of when I grew up down here and was used to the shakes and rumbles.&nbsp; It's just one of those things about living in California."

"event","So the last few weeks have been slightly unpleasant, not terrible really until this week, but still icky.&nbsp; Basically my boss took a lateral position in another department so now the whole department is reporting to the former night shift manager who is now working a regular 830-5 shift so she can cover half of each shift.&nbsp; It isn't really that bad in my opinion, because I've known her for years and we get along well, but for some of my co-workers they act like its the worst thing ever.&nbsp; For the last few weeks they've been b****ing about it, but the worst started today when the guy I share the office just made the shift absolutely miserable for me.&nbsp; It started with him being late, than he put on some of the worst techno club music ever followed by the soundtrack to zelda the game, usually I just tune him out, but today that was impossible.&nbsp; Then the snippy comments started in our instant message chat, the worst being comments to the boss about how the old boss never made us do this or that.&nbsp; Oy I hope he gets the new job he went after, because on one level he truly believes she will persecute him and still holds a grudge from the last time they locked horns.<br /><br />The other reason this has been an awful week is the change to an earlier shift, now I have to be logged on at work at 5:30a.m. with Mom's new job starting on Monday, I really can't see myself staying I need a shift that matches the rest of the house, so I've been applying to every possible weekends off, 8-5 shift. <br /><br />Last week my cousin's mom finally lost her battle with cancer which was sad I didn't know Madeline real well, but she managed to beat the illness back for a long time after getting her terminal diagnosis a couple years ago.&nbsp; I feel bad for my cousin and his half-sibs, but am glad they had plenty of time to prepare and say goodbye.&nbsp;  So I've been tired, cranky, and out of sorts, I had a migraine on Monday and reminding myself it will get better.&nbsp; I'll be starting the <b>NaNoWriMo</b> in a few days and got some great tips from the last couple of issues of The Writer's Magazine especially the one about first drafts just being to get the flow of the story and not to get stuck on writing the perfect sentence.&nbsp; Also I think some of the stress will start easing once mom gets her first paycheck, then I won't be solely responsible for caring for the family.&nbsp; I haven't minded supporting her, my brother and myself through college, but now that I'm getting close to being able to transfer to a BS degree program I'd like to stop living paycheck to paycheck and actually get a savings account again.&nbsp; With any luck the side effect to all of this will be a returned interest in my writing, I've gotten some lovely reviews on SLD and WEL recently, which were reminders that I have stories needing to be finished.&nbsp; Anyway I keep reminding myself that the best is yet to be."

"event","So a lot has happened recently, my brother and Mum both got offered jobs today!&nbsp; This is fantastic since I have jokingly told Mum when Mike called with the info that she'd be next (she was about 2 hours later) and then me.&nbsp; Only I know I won't hear about the job I interviewed for at least 10 days, since they just finished them today.&nbsp; I went to my interview on Wednesday, since I've been losing weight I had to buy a whole new outfit and makeup for it though $300 later I have to remind myself its an investment.&nbsp; Anyway I'm ecstatic even if my brother doesn't take the job, mom's new one will like double our income.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to moving to a better apartment, paying car insurance so I can drive and maybe actually getting ahead for once.&nbsp; If I get the new job than my salary will nearly double and we'll really be doing well then.&nbsp; I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but its all good.

Also the Women's Murder Club is a good show, but its funny that the guy who plays Ecklie is doing a guest appearance as an Ecklie-esqe Editor, but the show is really good.&nbsp; I never read James Patterson's books, but after watching this show I think I'll put it on my to read list."

"event","<b>Warning: fanfic rant<br /></b>After reading the YTDAW long lost writers thread to get the scope on why a particular author left the fandom and deleted all her accounts and stories I found myself very irritated at the reasons.&nbsp; Let me qualify this by explaining I am NOT upset with the author, they are her stories, her identity and her right to do with them as she chooses.&nbsp; I am however upset with the people behind her reasons.&nbsp; She expressed concern about her conservative employers discovering her hobby.&nbsp; The fact that she has to be concerned about losing her employment/profession because of her internet activity irks me to no end.&nbsp; Its that fact that in this free country, our right to free speech can be hindered by fear because in my mind its a form of censorship.&nbsp; Perhaps even the worst kind of censorship because it is making the author ban her own work from public view.&nbsp; Perhaps I am naive about the real world, blame it on my California liberal upbringing, but it isn't right or fair for that to happen.<br /><br />That being said, knowing that there might be a background investigation in my future if I get that job with the City I am now suddenly afraid and I don't like it one bit.&nbsp; Now don't get in a panic, or anything, I maybe a little bit worried now, but I have  no intention to remove myself from the fandom.&nbsp; Its funny the thought that they might hold my writing against me actually makes me want to fight the system while the rest of me just points out that when G-d closes a door, another opens and I can't get so focused on the ""negative"" loss of opportunity that I miss the wonderful new one presenting itself.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>Fanfic update</b><br /><br />Have I forgotten my WIPs....NO of course not, have I had trouble seeing the next part,&nbsp; Yes but after watching Criminal Minds last week I've revamped parts of the next chapter in Close Quarters and hope to have it posted before Thursday with any luck.&nbsp; I feel bad about not having updated recently, and that feeling only got worse after checking out the CSI Fanfiction Award nominations.&nbsp; To those who nom'd me I thank you.&nbsp; Just being considered is an honor, to have 2 stories and a drabble chosen seems miraculous especially since When the Evidence Lies is in the same category as some of my fav WIPs from this year like Reality Alternate, El Dorado and Candyshop.&nbsp; Which means there are some really great stories and I can't imagine trying to pick just one because they are 3 really engaging stories, by 3 really great writers who I admit are the ones I read not only for fun, but also to see how good stories are constructed and to help me improve my writing skills.&nbsp; The other story that was nominated was Penalty Box, though I'm not sure the classification is quite right since its listed as slash and honestly its more of a het multiple partner story.&nbsp; It's funny, even after more than 18 months with the story idea and having it posted for 6 months PB still makes me blush and is one I would hate having anyone who ""knows"" me in RL knowing I wrote.&nbsp; That's so silly isn't it, but true.&nbsp; I've told my Mom about most of my stories and gotten her input on my plot or character development, but that is one she doesn't know about.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway its late and I need sleep so I can study tomorrow since I have 3 mid-terms due in the next 7 days.&nbsp; I wish the ff author in the first paragraph the best of luck and hope she continues to write, even if just for her own pleasure."

"event","Recently I have found a couple of new shows that I adore enough to record or stay up late to watch them.&nbsp; The first is Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares (the American version) which premiered on Fox this week.&nbsp; First off let me begin by saying I am a new comer to the wonderfulness of Chef Ramsey and Hell's Kitchen.&nbsp; Mom got me hooked a few months ago watching a Hell's Kitchen marathon, followed by BBC America's Kitchen Nightmares.&nbsp; Anyway Ramsey is wonderful and in the America version he just proves that.

Inside Jail is the latest series from the producers of cops watched it on Courtv last night, practically had too since the first location shown was the Clark County Jail.&nbsp; Boy even after hearing the stories from family members who work booking I was surprised by the crap Officers deal with.&nbsp; Its a good show though and a definite visual on why extreme drunken-ness is bad.

The Professor &amp; Veronica is actually all about Tim Gunn's new show which is a must see.&nbsp; The man understands fashion, is very sweet to the ladies he's working with and actually gives advice I think I can implement in my own life.&nbsp; 

I also watched Criminal Minds the other night which refreshed that part of CQ for me and give me a marvelous idea for adding to the next chapter, only with mid-terms coming up in the next few days I'm hoping to find a few minutes to slip it in.&nbsp; The tv watching is part of my carrot and stick program for studying; a couple hours of study or completing an assignment = an hour of play either on computer, tv or something else.&nbsp; So far the 15 units isn't killing me and I'm managing to keep up (sorta) so I'm hoping things will settle down soon so I can write more,"

"event","School officially started today and I'm enrolled in 15 units online.&nbsp; Yes, some of you are shaking your heads thinking when will she learn, but honestly its not that bad.&nbsp; 3 of the classes are Administration of Justice with the Professor I had this summer and she only requires 3 major assignments per class so I'm not too worried about them.&nbsp; One of the classes is intro to criminal evidence.&nbsp; So after this semester I'll have like 5 classes in my major, 5 GE and 2 electives to finish and then I'm done with the A.S. in Administration of Justice.&nbsp; It's starting to feel like I can actually get this degree done and then transfer to finish off my Bachelor's Degree.&nbsp; I'm not sure where I'll be going for that, just found out today that my Psych 1 professor helped start this honor transfer program to UCLA if I do well and make up my couple of bad grades that might be an option, not sure if its one I want, but options are good right?&nbsp; So the final class rounding out this craziness is Geography 1 which luckily for me can be used to fulfill the science option.&nbsp; I just don't have the time right now to get to the school for a real science class so am making do with whatever options I can find online.

I'm off work until September 7th thank goodness!&nbsp; I really needed a break from it.&nbsp; The software system that's replacing my position is up and online which has me wondering if TPTB are gonna change their mind for the millionth time and decide that they don't need us after all.&nbsp; My boss is on vacation until the 5th so there's no hope of getting any info because her co-manager has been busy trying to cover both jobs and important stuff has been falling through the cracks as it is.&nbsp; Basically I went into work this weekend totally blind with no info on how the new system is working, what tptb's expectations were and what the new processes were.&nbsp; Basically the emails we were promised never got sent so I spent a lot of the weekend trying to figure s*** out which ticked me off.&nbsp; When boss gets back hopefully she'll fix that so I'll come back knowing what my job is.&nbsp; Though I still plan to apply for jobs.&nbsp; The sad thing is all of these clerical 2 and 3 law enforcement jobs I'm applying for make more money than a criminalist 1.

Nearly had car trouble today, some bf nail was stuck in the side wall of the tire.&nbsp; We took to Big O who pronounced it safe to drive until the replacement comes in tomorrow.&nbsp; An unexpected expenditure, which makes me grateful I didn't get the new laptop.&nbsp; Tomorrow night I'll be joining mom in sitting through her psychology of courts, she's taking the course I'm just kinda auditing, though if anyone asks she'll just mention how her cataracts makes her afraid to drive at night and that's why I'm there.&nbsp; Still looking forward to it."

"event","Im sooo Sleepy and i cant wait to go home..today has been a pretty good day i guess besides the fact that i dont who in the world has my phone # and whose been calling me..its kind of upsetting. this journal thing is kind of weird cause im really really not use to writing down my thoughts but i'll try. i dont know maybe its because im not all that trusting like i obviously cant even trust pen and paper let alone humans..Ha Ha...but iam glad that i've found ashley as a friend because i've really missed having a someone that i can trust to tell stuff to..and get an honest opinion from. so i guess im doing a whole lot better...i'll just have to warm up to this whole journal thing i guess, i have to admit it does seem kind of fun...PryncsPocahonts"

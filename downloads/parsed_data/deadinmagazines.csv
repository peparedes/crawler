"event","I know its been a while since I even looked at this journal but...I Cant help but sit up in the early AM and my mind racing at full speed thinking. What really does the future hold? In a nonsensical thought. Is life worth living with out having accomplished something. Is it a waste of breath to exist and not produce anything worth while? Being 24 and not really having much to say for your life...

To live with such regrets, keep me up this late wondering...who am I? What have I become as a man? Ive spent many a year as a musician struggling to make some sort of difference somewhere if not just to myself. Hoping some where out there it makes someone smile or just feel something period. Yet, through the struggle it sometimes seems worthless. My family hardly exists as even that. A father, to whom I really know nothing about other than he is a hard worker who could possibly work himself into an early grave. A Mother, who raised my sister and I but recently has been nothing but an emotional nervous wreck. Hearing her cries through the seemingly hallow walls of my house every other night or even day...it brings to me a sad realization that I dont really know what a family is supposed to be like. My parents seemingly never got along as far as I can remember, but now that they are separated it feels like even more so of a strain to feel what family is supposed to be about. My father occupying his small apartment in NJ, meanwhile my mother, sister, and I live in the house that would soon be up for market. Inevitably we will all go our separate ways each of us into the abyss that is life. A world of undying uncertainties. Myself heading where? Perhaps Tokyo, but with whom? Not a clue. Maybe alone. Only the test of time may tell me where that road may lead. TO see if my band can stay together and stay true long enough to make it. To see if love really weighs more than well...alot of other things.

Here I sit tapping ferociously at the keys trying to make sense of all the rambling my mind has been going on and on and on about. Maybe I was right. Maybe we all live too long, that we take time for granted. In the old days, people lived a lot shorter lives and seemingly accomplished so much more than their modern day counterparts. Although a traditionalist mindset. Raising your children to take over where you left off. A carpenter breeding a carpenter. So at least if what they pursued as individuals didn't work out they always had their life's trade to fall back on. Living to be 40 if your lucky. People made honest men and women out of themselves through all sorts of things. Some became kings, some lived on to be poor until the day they died. I just feel that with people living until 100 and above people take time for granted. In all honesty, I feel that perhaps I should only live until 30 unless something is truly worth living for. A Family of my own perhaps. A career in something. Someone to feel loved by. Even love seems so...temporary. You love someone for so long it almost seems absent because its expected. What is marriage worth these days? Everyone gets divorced in the long run. They run their course with the ones they ""love"" only to rethink it all and look for a refund on the years they spent ""loving"" someone that they believe they no longer love. Was it love to begin with? You hear the saying people change...but thats just it we all do its what makes us who we are. Its really, are you able to make compromises to grow closer to the other? Most would say yes, but you know its really no.  I am in love, but the returning light of love that I yearn to bask in feels so distant like the after glow of a star in a foreign galaxy only to be lost in the vacuum that is life.

Nothing but death is certain. Its the world's harsh reality that you will be constantly reminded of until your expiration date. I feel like im living in a fish tank watching everyone move past and around me meanwhile I'm locked in this world left to my own devices that only I really care about. Even in the virutal world that I've locked my soul away in. Its a form of escapism I guess. Ive had my mind and heart hidden and locked away in games like Lineage II and now Aion, but perhaps all I really require is good progress. A nice goal to really work towards that would show some fruits of my labor. Something more than S grade armor and a pay on the back. I yearn for true purpose it seems...its something i hope to see someday...perhaps someday soon. AS of right now, I see no reason to get up in the morning. its not depression its realization...maybe my own journey would do me some good. To pack a bookbag of nothing but the essentials and wander the world. It would probably do more harm than good as Ive grown accustomed to no longer be a loner. I thrive the warmth of people and their grab bag of personalities. Maybe if this were middle school again. I think I could make that journey just fine. Its just not right anymore...its just not right.

"event","*sigh* Im back to the states. Back to the same old thing. God, I miss japan already. Ive watched lost in translation four times already. Ive missed everyone here but, its like even though amanda and I were alone with no one to talk to, it felt more like home. Everything seemed right, right where it was. The trains, people, lights, music, the worlds largest city. I could live there the rest of my life if given the chance. The last two days, I couldnt wait to come back home to see everyone. To see everyone I missed for the week and a half Ive been gone. Yet now there is this emptiness inside me I cannot fill. Shinjuku, Harajuku, Yotsuya, Yoyogi, Shinagawa, Shibuya, Ueno, Yokosuka, Miraikaigan, Ginza, and the other districts of Tokyo, everything left me feeling at home. I just wanna grab all my friends, my family, my band and fly back to Tokyo. I wouldnt have known I would feel this lost. Even now, suffering jet lag, I have been up since I left tokyo pretty much, an hour of sleep here and there. I just cant deal with it. In Tokyo, music was everywhere. Guitarists bloomed in the streets of Harajuku, Ochanemizu, and Shibuya. Ive never seen so many Music Stores/Guitar Stores in one area. Nor so many musicians. You could take the train anywhere, or even walk anywhere. Everything was there accept my friends and family...I almost didnt come back. I just want to pick up a job from the paper and get my work visa and just never come back. Yet I knew t hat if I had done that, I would have lost more of my self than I already have. Tears well up under my eyes everytime I think about the peace I felt. I cant explain to any of you how i feel right now. Ive finally gotten to visit the country Ive loved since I was 4. Ive dreamed of that day for my entire life and i was so happy w hen i was there. Here I am, a victim of the aftermath, and I cant comprehend this depression ive found my self slumping into. I neeed to save up more cash so I can go back. I must go back...

Sincerely Saddened,
Kai Chow Yuen"

"event","Fuck, I just dont know how much longer I can do this...each and everyweek is exactly the same. I wake up, monday morning, scrounge around the house for what little food there is, get online and see if there is someone to talk to. Usually there is atleast someone, yet their usually on their way out to go do something. 2PM rolls around and its time to work, working that day to please the common consumer. Although most of who we receive are those who have no patience for the mail system in the first place. Being the new employee I constantly find my self under someone's thumb even though ive worked at UPS Stores before. When closing time rolls around I take my uniform off and wait outside. Its 7:00PM and im waiting for someone to come get me. 19 years old about to be twenty and still no car. Due to the stroke of luck I sort of ran into. The fucking curb. Yes, the curb, put my entire car our of commision. I wasnt even speeding, stupid hydroplaning baldtires.Ever since then my axel has been broken and I shant ever have the money to fix it due to only making $146.85 every two weeks. Thats enough for food, and perhaps a movie. Even though usually it always seems that when I get my paycheck its someone's holiday, be it a birthday, father's day, mother's day, or something to that effect. But back to my routine. After about fourty mi nutes someone finally comes and picks me up, no matter how cold or how hot it may be, I have no choice but to wait almost an hour for them. Then finally I come home to war. My mom is angry at my father for one thing or another, or perhaps vice versa. My father angry at my mother for nothing in perticular. Meanwhile, like charging rhino in the african safari heat. They come barging in my room yelling at me for things that I have no control over. Why I never take the garbage out or wash the dishes or keep my room clean. These things wouldnt be so bad if staying in my house was enjoyable, atleast alittle bit. After their long lecture about me being almost a full adult, they fade off somewhere and forget I exist until they find something else to yell at me about. I sit online and listen to music, just as I am doing now. My only salvation, my guitar. One of t he few things that I can do and try and relax. Although as of recently Ive been realizing my decline in musical talent. having fallen behind everyone else. The new As I Lay Dying is near impossible for me to play. The same with the new Haste the Day. I mean even the old As I Lay Dying, I cant play the solos. At all. Tripilet Picking....struggle. I find my self unable to play the things or even write the things I wish my fingers to excersize. I play my guitar until 930 rolls around or until I get the ""Do you realize what time it is?"" speech. Then I just turn it off, throw it somewhere, turn on some more As I Lay Dying, Haste the Day, Throwdown, Comback Kid, Dir en grey, X-Japan, Spread Beaver, or something of that choosing. Listening to that on Volume 3 until I find that sitting on the computer cant even hold my interest any more and I either A. Get into bed in the middle of talking to someone. Or B. Leave my AIM up and go downstairs and watch TV until I pass out. Then the next day the same routine all over again until thursday. Thursday is the day I wake up 4 AM in the morning for no apparent reason and sit around all day waiting for band practice to come around. Although I wish that maybe I could hang out with a bandmember or two before hand. But yes, we arent tight like that. We all live seperate lives from one another. We dont really see each other outside of the band. We just do our thing on stage and in the practice room together, but once its done. Its over. Everyone leaves to go hang out with other people, go home to study, or they need sleep for work in the morning. Me, of course. I have to sit around and wait for someone to opt to take me home. Although it is where Id rather not be. After I'm taken home I get bombarded with IMs by everyone talking about what they did that day. OF course, nothing I do shall ever seem remotely interesting. That day wishing that perhaps I had worked instead. Being that I dont make enough money to sustain a bank account to save for a car. And even if I did save, it would take me four years to get a car. Even then Id only make enough to have laibility on my car. So if it died. That would be it. No more car for Mr.Kai.

Friday, a day that either makes me or breaks me. If I have a show, I know ill atleast go somewhere with my band, even though we wont spend much time together, accept for the occasional banter about what we are doing that day. And what wishes we have for if one day wed get signed. Although as of right now, we dont even have a CD and we've been around going on 2 years. Gigging as much as possible. Like this day, friday. The day we'd play together, then seperate yet again. As everyone walks off and does their own thing. Talks to the girls, relates to everyone around them, or goes home due to them being tired or angry about something. So then ends that day, I come home and do just as I am doing now. Sitting on my pc trying to pretend I have a life.

But, here is what happens if I dont have anything to do friday. I sit at home until I get a phone call from amanda saying ""Hey, what are you doing?"" and I say ""Nothing, im bored."" and she says she is too. The usually conversation we have over the phone. Then we try and think of things to do on a friday night but we are both broke so eventually it ends of either me at her house doing nothing until I fall asleep. Or me stuck at home doing this yet again. Sitting on my pc. Or playing alittle guitar. Gaining what little skill I can in two hours.

But then rolls around saturday. The day I'll either have band practice, which usually doesnt happen until 6 or we have another show. In which I sit around until I can find someone to drive me to the show or atleast to jerry's to get to the show. The same thing happens that happens on friday if I have a show. Then I come home. and sit on my pc.

Sunday rolls around and I start to realize how much of a waste each weekend is getting each individual day makes me wonder why someone else couldnt be using my air, my space (no pun intended), my vary position in life. the waste of humanity just starts to bring me into a coma of self loathing and desprateness for something more.

Here I am, 19 going on 20. Working a dead end job, no car. nothing to do, no hope for a future, no where to look. no one. Hello Morning, Noon, Evening, Night, Stars, and Life. What do you have for me today?

Sincerely,

Mr.Kai

Man oh man. Its been a long assed time. So much has happened. I dont even know really where to start. So...screw talking about what happened. Ill talk about whats going ot happen. Im looking forward to going to the Sakura Matsuri on the 9th or April. Its going to be awesome. I get to see Japanese Performers (Including J-rock and J-pop groups) Buy Japanese food and drinks. I just love the atmosphere in general n.n; Its really fun and everyones usually having a good time. Anyway, right now I'm working at the UPS Store in Glen Burnie. Its an alright job. It would be awesome if I were getting paid good money. RIght now im only making 6.70 and managers are making 7.50 Which is pretty much shit. lol. Im trying to see if I can pick up more hours because I want to get my car fixed and badly but I cant afford it right now becuase I still need money to buy food and such and with out money for that I'll pretty much starve, lol. Theres like never any food in the house. Also I'm hoping to buy a new guitar so I can put my synth on it. Even if its shitty. I need one that I can put good pickups in. I am looking at some ibanez RG guitars. They are pretty good. If I can do that I can play guitar and synth at the same time. And as of right now, no other bands do that here. So go me :D

Anyway, im bored. So Im going to shut up. I got things I could be doing but Im not so....yea.

kthnxbyebiyatch!

"event","Wow, over the past two days ive been down with allergies or something. My sinuses draining mucus and snot from my nasal passages into my throat and its drowinging me as we speak. 5:59AM I wake up in a sputter cough, barely able to gasp for air as im drowning literally in my own mucus. Just as I was about to gasp for breath, I throw up, and not just any throw up but a mucus and stomach fluid filled throw up....through my nose... Now tell me im not sick? This just makes my day yanno? ;_; I hate being sick and I hate throwing up so right now. Kai isnt a happy camper. Angry enough to actually post it in his LJ. God I feel like someones using my head and a god damned snot toilet bowl. Flushing it down into my throat and nasal passages. I dont know what to do. I told my mom, having to wake her up and she gets up set with me because I woke her up? What the fuck. Not to mention having stomach acids run through your nasal passages stings likea fucking bitch. Now its numb from all the acid that ran through it. uhhhg...my only sanctuary has been NIN. Ive been sleeping to : Adrift and At Peace, La Mer, The GReat Below, and the Day the world went away. Very peaceful songs indeed. Now hopefully ill find something to do instead of sleeping... ;_; I hate being sick....

"event","Well well well. Look what we have here. Another post for me :D

Anywho, Yea. I havent posted in like a week or so. Sorry about that. Not that anything I have said in the past couple weeks have been interesting...but. Lol I just feel like babling on and on about my daily life. So here it is:

For the past couple of days Ive been pretty much doing the same thing. Waking up. Being bored. Hanging out with Amanda. Band Practice. getting sicker. Coming home. And then sitting on the internet until the next day and the cycle goes on and on an on. Recently I went to the Guitar Center in Glen Burnie. I saw a couple of good guitars that I am willing to purchase, but of course there is the problem of having no mooney n.n;; So, of course i just sulked because anything good that I might want to get always seems to get sold by the time i get money or I wind up having to spend the money on something else. Like food. We havent really had any food in the house for a while. Every once in a while my parents might go out and get milk and cereal, but you cant eat that every day! So I usually wind up spending all my money on something to eat, because if I didn't Id more than likely starve for the next two weeks. Before a couple weeks ago we didnt have food in our house for like three months. My sister and I were really upset because the only real meal we had was either in school or maybe something we could scrounge up in the house. well anywho, enough of that. So now I'm on a trek to start looking for a job. I really need one. I need one early though so I can wake up early go to work and then get out in enough time to have band practices. I hope I find one and quick. I hear rumor from both Amanda and my sis that my parents plan on kicking me out at the end of January. Pssh, I like how they tell everyone but me. So as of now im currently struggling between looking for a job, both my bands, and college and my family. What should I do? Sometimes I just wish I could give everything up and join a monestary or something. With out all t hese other material things life might be alittle easier. Not so much to worry about. Just my own enlightenment. but yea....Also my dad is getting rid of the tags on my car and taking them back to the DMV because we cant afford to keep my car on the insurenace. So hes going to get it towed into the junk yard also. Im like wtf. Why can I keep my car until I can get it re insured. Its under my name I should be able to choose what I want to do with it. Oui. What to do what to do. Anyway. Im going to get off here. I think ive just reached an all time low. Im going to go eat chocolate or something.

Sincerely well...not,
Mr. Kai"

"event","Man, last night was killer. Ive been waiting for three months for Dead to Fall to come to Maryland. I just heard about them from my friend andrew. He let me listen to it and it was killer. Full of metal core breakdowns and lots and lots of two stepping and spinkicks. Everyone at the sidebar was throwing down like they were james brown in chinatown, with an upside down frown, wearing their mama's night gown. It was all kinds of crazy. There were emo kids there too. But you know, they just kinda....sat there. I think they were crying on the inside. Man, I wish I started tissue patrol. Anywho! Yea, before Dead to Fall came on, another band had played One Bullet Short of a Massacre. They were insane. They were spinning their guitars around like the turning hands on a clock. Round and Round they went, where they stopped......well one almost hit me in the nuts, but thats besides the point. They even got a hxc encore. They demanded more breakdowns. and well, they indeed, played more breakdowns. It was sick. One of the guitarists even put his guitar down and jumped in the pit. The singer was so enthusiastic too. Most singers kinda just get up there and scream but he put allot of energy into it. He was a pretty kool dude too. I hope to play some shows with them in the future. They were from Northern VA. Moreover, dead to fall came on, and well....the sickness persued. There was breakdown after breakdown after breakdown, and metal riffage, they even played their rendition of a At the Gates song. It definately made my day. I love At the Gates. When they played Bastard Set of Dreams. There were dog piles on the mic all over the place. I love those guys, they were killer. I hope that I can perhaps write riffage like that in the near future. As of right now, I think im just concentrating on writing music that will bring out each and everyone one of the band member's talents.

Now onto today. Right now I'm at amanda's work. They are about to have this huge snooty party with a bunch of representatives from different companies in Realty. Its probably going to be boring, but i didnt mind coming it seems like it might be fun. but atleast me and amanda are going to have some fun. They have lots of food so i hear. I think im going to have to check that out, lol. Yea...Im a fatass. I cant help it. Food just calls to me like Jesus hanging from the ceiling, waving a Gibson Les Paul in my face.

I have practice later. I might post about that when i get home. As for now. See ya!

Sincerely Tired,
Mr. Kai"

So yea, anywho. Today A Bullet Away wrote a news song. I decided to stay in the band. No reason to lose a good thing right? I mean. We actually wrote a song today and its tight. It has synth sounding stuff and happy breakdowns. Its awesome. I love it and it will be so passionate. Also on a better note, we are playing Glassboro NJ this weekend. My first out of state show in a long time, we will have so much fun and hopefully INVU will be able to play it too. That would rock forever. I cant wait because Its near my old hometown. I hope to see some people there. I doubt it though.

Well yea, so Anyone out there have a guitar they dont want. Im going through new guitar withdraw. I need another guitar to play with ;_;

I guess thats all for now

Sincerely sleepy,

"event","Sooo....yea....INVU Had practice last night it was pretty good. We didnt get much done as a band but me and casper got down the parts of the song that needed to be. So now we have half of a new song. We better play it at the show, because if we dont. Heads will Roll. We have two more practices to do so. I hope we just floor everyone at the show because our past show was horrible. I dont ever want to see a repeat of that again. Its about 8:43 and Im about to head off to college. Im looking for something to carry my mini-amp in. I wanna rock out in the cafe or something. But knowing me im going to be a lazy S.O.B. and not bring it. Last night i got in an argument with amanda about withces and such. Shes pissed at wiccans in florida for protesting the visual image of witches in modern day halloween. She thinks its stupid to protest about, and because four florida school cancelled the Halloween Parade, shes all like ""IT isnt right! Its a Kids holiday now!"" and I was like, ""It was a pagan holiday first. Hallows Eve of what ever."" and she is like ""Yea but it isnt now"" and im like ""Back in the old old days, christians created new holidays to cover up pagan holidays like winter solstice and stuff like that."" and I mean now that everything is Halloween and Christmas, of course those holidays will never change but she doesnt think it should matter how they portray witches, but I mean, would someone want people to protray them wrongfully? I mean look at me, what if every time I saw a picture of myself it was like I dont know Cousin It playing a guitar. Id be pretty pissed about it. Because thats not what i look like. I mean im sure there are wiccans out there that have a hard time telling kids they are witches with out them freaking out. I mean think about all those movies you saw with the kids who snuck on the ladie's property next door claiming she must be some evil witch. I mean, some parents especially some of really religious up bringings dont want their kids near Wiccans.I think thats completely unfair. Im not wiccan, my family is Jewish, although I dont practice the Jewish religion. We have had our fair share or prejudice yanno? It be pretty fucked up if someone's parents said ""Oh you cant hang out with Kai because hes a Jew"" or I mean for that matter what if they said they couldnt hang out with me because Im mixed with lik every race under the sun? My point is that its not right for media to portray witches the way they do. Amanda was like ""They have been protraying witches like that for hundreds of years"" and im like ""And that makes it right? Most people that did that, created those images so that people would naturall shun witches. Oucast them and turn their heads. Fear them."" I know a couple of really nice, really kind ""Witches"". I mean Im not sure if there is a difference between Wiccans and Witches, maybe they only call them withces for practicing witchcraft but as I said before. There is allot more to a witch than meets the eye. And I know for sure, I havent met any green faced hags trying to feed me poison candy or apples. 

Well my dad just hollared for me, I gotta run. BAI!!!"

"event","*ahem* Ok, Yea. So anywho. This past saturday was awesome. I met allot of really kool people. Amanda, Sashi, an I went to an EGL (Elegant Gothic Lolita) Party. Yet on our way there we got lost, on several occasions, for two and a half hours. IN ELLICOT CITY!!! How the hell can you do that!? Anyway, lol. Amanda wouldnt stop and ask for solid directions and then when she did, she forgot them. She shoulda wrote them down. [Jeez, isnt that what guys usually do?] So we ran circles around howard and baltimore county. We even wound up in some really bad section of baltimore it seemed. We just turned around. We couldnt find Marriotsville road. Well anyway we finally go back up 40 towards the other section of the patapsaco state park and ask them where the other section of the park was.

 Well the lady there seemed pretty iritated, she said ""Look, this is real simple. You just get out here on 40. And You go East, and you stay on 40, for a good 8 Miles. Dont turn any where, until you see Marriotsville Road."" and well We did and we finally found the damned road then we stayed on that for a good while and we were going up this hill and BLAMO! *Skid* outta now where the park showed up, like there were no warning signs, it was just [PARK!] So we made an emergency turn into the road. We came up to the entryway gate and the guys looked at us and we gave outr entrance fee and he said ""501 right?"" amd we were like ""Huh..? Oh yea!"" and he just chuckled. Now just imagine, hes seen allot of strange people showing up all day. Dressed in Victorian Styled Dresses, English Tea Party stuff, and all kinds of stuff all day. And Here we are a group of three. Sashi was a Gothic Lolita, Amanda was a Gothic Aristocrat [Which by the way, looked awesome], and I was dressed as Kaoru from Diru, out of the Obscure Video and Photoshoot [Although allot of people dont recognize it, I dont know if they have seen the video yet.] So we were a lively bunch as well. 

We finally get up there and the people at the part go ""Wow! The missing people are here!"" and well I felt kind of awkward at first because I thought I was the only guy there. But there was this other guy there, he was pretty awesome. We talked about European Black Metal and X-Japan and hide and stuff. He used to play guitar, but then he quit beause of college and stuff. But I think he should pick it back up so we can jam. Anywho, we talked for a logn time, the girls were taking pictures and such and after they were done they all wanted to introduce themselves in a circle. They told me to come over and well, I walked over, shy as ever. I sat there and as each person said Their Name, Favorite J-rocker, Least FAvorite J-rocker and their Favorite J-rock band.   Everyone there was very nice and polite and they all were pretty awesome. Im so horrible with names though. I forgot allot of people's names because I never remember names right away. [Im sorry if some of youa reading this and I dont remember your name!!! *hides*] There was one girl who I had seen at Katsu before and talked to. She was standing next to this other girl who was cosplaying as Kozi. She was talking to me and as far as I remember the conversation was brief, but anyway she was the g/f of that guy I was talking to earlier, they were so kool. 

Well, soon it was my turn to introduce my self and I was like ""Hi, my name is Kai. My favorite J-rockers are hide, Kaoru, and Ken. My least favorite J-rocker I'll leave nameles-"" and as soon as I said that they were like ""Who is it? Its mana isnt it!"" and I nodded my head. At the moment I felt as thought Id get eaten alive, or made into a bunt cake or something! But no only a couple made comments but others were ok with my dislike for mana. And really its not my dislike for Mana, its my grudge against Elitist Malice Mizer and Mana fans. But ill get into that later. well, after that introduction process everyone really just branched off and talked amongst themselves. I kinda just wandered off playing air guitar to the awesome music blaring from that guy's car. I was hoping his battery didnt kill it self from playing the stereo with his car not on. Allot of people, after about an hour had to go Well I gave hugs to everyone, and everyone gave me a hug, but this one girl [Elani] inparticular, I thought she was coming to give me a hug and they bit me. In the neck. It caught me off guard rather, i was like *bite* whoa.....*dizzy* lol I dont think I shoulda enjoyed that one but well...lol. It was rather weird. 

But moving along. We stuck around an talked to everyone about music and such and the girl who i saw at katus came over and said ""So tell me more about this dislike for mana"" and well it was weird that she was so interested but I told her about the fans I keep running into who down me for listening to what i listen to because they think MM and Mana are the greatest things ever and no one can touch them. She just nodded and she didnt kill me. She understood what I was saying but it turned out her favorite j-rocker was Mana. I was so surprised she didnt kill me in my sleep, like with a tea kettel or smother me with her teddy bear! lol. [ That teddy bear was rockin my style] j/k but yea near the end. I had to get off to having band practice and I was already late. So I tried to pry not only amanda but myself as well away from everyone. I had so much fun and I miss everyone so much. Its not often you get to hang out with people with similar interests. Being that my life revolves around music and my favorite music is J-rock. IT was good times. But I got amanda away from them and we said our good byes and exchanged info to everyone and then we left, amanda was so sad. She doesnt have all too many friends, and she never has anyone to hang out with. So she gets attached to people she has allot in common with.

So we get to jerry's house. I thought I was late but i get out the car and no one's car was there. and I mean no one's not even jerry's so Im like WTF? I call casper and I didnt get any answer and I called Ben and Ben didnt pick up, but then he called me back soon after and I talked to him and aparrently we were supposed to have practicve at 2 that day. Well it was 6 now. but the plan was to have practice at 6. Casper didnt get out of work until then. well everyone was pisse dbecause jerry said ""I can only practice until 630"" and well it got pretty gay. We were all angry because we really needed that practice. This week we only have one because Im not going ot be intown. Ill be at ANIME USA! [You all should come!] I cant wait ot see Camino! They were on tour with Duel Jewel I think. But I missed them. They are back and I hope they are as good as everyone says they are, but I have no doubts. Well, enough digressing. So everyone was pissed. Sunday. I had ABA Practice, it was alright, no one was there but Danny, Dave, and I. The problem with that is. Danny has too much energy and not allot of attention span. Hes always playing and doesnt stop. So its hard to get things done. I Was trying to get people to write. but I really didnt have any new material. so I decided to use an old Blackberry Crush song ""Seperate the Stars"" Its very peaceful. I love to play it and hear it. But I wanted to write a heavy song as well. For our next show to have some new songs. Well, dani showed us like a part of a song, and he didnt have anything more so I tried utting stuff after that and while I was trying to figure it out he kept playing, and then he turned his amp up. SO, I couldnt hear anything anymore. He does that allot. But I fogrgive him, he still doesnt get it, that if your standing next to your amp you wont hear anything, because the speakers at your legs so its all going past you. Well he went on playing and we didnt get anythign done.

 So we just kinda jammed alittle and then he went outside and me and dave jammed out a jam that I usually play at INVU practice. My problem is that I dont like using  INVU Material with ABA Unless I know we wont be using it. Like its hard for me to write a hardcore song for ABA because then I feel like im stealing from INVU. The same reason why I dont like writing soft stuff for INVU because I feel like im steal material from ABA. Its hard being in two bands at once playing guitar in both. I want to play drums or do vocals in a band. Ah well, so....what was I gunna say after this.... hmmmm...I forgot...OH YEA! I got to finally jam with my neighbors. It was rockin. I have these neighbors down the street from me, two houses over. That started up a band. When they first got their equipment. I said ""You guysin a band?"" and they were like ""No...we are just fuckin around. We havent played in ten years."" and I was like ""Hah, you say that now, but watch. You start buying more stuff, and jamming and writing, and then BLAMO! You'll want to be in a band. Its like Impending Doom!"" lol I mena you cant spend 3,000 dollars a piece on equipment and not do anything serious with it. and soon they were talking about needing a front man and a bassist and all this stuff. Well I introduced them to zakk, and well they got zakk for g uitar. [Even thought thats what I wanted to play. But of course Zakk is better at soloing than I am.] So they got zakk, well I just kinda wtched, and well they said they were looking for a bassit. I had contemplated playing bass for them but I wasnt sure if i wanted to sit around and have nothing to do. Wellbass isnt nothing but youc ant like chop shit up with rythmns and leads and stuff unless your like Billy Sheehan or Stu Ham, or The guy from Dream Theatre. Jon May Yong I think his name is. I dont remember. But I decided to do it. I got my VOX amp head and a PA speaker together and made a ghetto amp head, which actually turned out to sound really really nice.lol. So we jammed out a song and it was killer. Jeff, he writes some sick shit. IT was megadeth sounding, and awesome. Well they had a part in the song for a little bas interlude, and I just wrote a part on the spot and they loved it so we play that now. and we spent allot of time on the song, and then later that day i had ABA practice.

Well that same day I got dave to drop me off at Amanda's house [We had an argument earlier, I puncheda huge dent my car, but thats anther story.] We went to go visit mel in the hospital, her baby was adorable, even though it had like red stuff on its head but they said it was just from the needle. Mel was alright, she looked fine, alittle tired but fine. Will was there. and man he was taking everything so well. I woulda thought I would come in there seeing him balled up in the corner pulling his hair out, but he was all relaxed and stuff. We took him out to hooters. Jeremy, Josh, Amanda and I. I dont like hooters all too much. I sometimes wonder if Im gay and I dont know it but man. I just dont like the place. Amanda said the curly fries were killer. Well...you know what. they were! I devoured a Philly Cheese Steak [That I was eating in Baltimore. lmao] and then the curly fries. It was awesome. I loved it. Will even got a couple copies of hooter's magazine and a hooter's calendar. The girls even signed it. hah, I hope mel doesnt kill him. 

Well as we were hanging out, Jeremy and Josh were talking about music and Jeremy happened to mention to me before online that Josh said he sounded like the old singer from Underoath. And well when we were hanging out, He told me again. Hes proud of himself :D. So anyway, I got an idea I had a while ago. Since Josh and I are both Jewish. I want to start a Jewish hardcore band. lmao. There are so many Christian Hardcore bands. Why the fuck not?! So anyway we got to talking about it and Jeremy said hed buy a PA. So there we go, I might have another band. Josh and I were talking about making it Visual. Im sooo getting yyelled at by INVU and ABA. I can hear it now. but I mean a Visual HxC band is the closest Ill ever get to Jrock. So why not? Its my dream and life. right? So later that night i showed Josh the website I made for a visual hardcore band I made, it was a fake band site, but I actually might make it real. It would rock if I could. its called Geist. you can see it here Http://geocities.com/geistonline So now JEremy is getting a PA and Josh is getting some strobe lights and such, and its going to rock. Also Josh asked me to make him some neato pictures for his myspace. and I did. Check em out.

"event","Alright, I know I havent posted in a while, but in the past couple months ive been having a pretty hard time between college and band. But IFd like to start this post with something important. As of recently The band members of INVU have decided to aprt ways with tommy. For many reasons. 1. He was always pushing people's buttons constantly 2. He showed off allot. Even when he shouldnt have. 3. His opinion had to be a message from god because he always had to right. and 4. He wasnt fitting our musical style. Now you see. out of all the members of the group. I was one of the key members, that when everyone was talking about kicking tomm yout whatd id I say? ""Dude, I dont care. Hes my friend but do what you guys want im tired of fighting."" now after saying that. What am I supposed to do but regret it after tommy posts something like this in our Guestbook.

Kai: Drop the emo act and the ego. Music should be without baggage, and you really dont need it to compensate for your talents.  So here it is; I had alot of fun in the band. However, the songwriting is about as unoriginal as it comes (wonder why everyone calls us,..i mean you, underoath?), and apparently none of you have respect for a friend, because thats what I thought I was to you. A friend. Good bye.""

Now that fuckin hurt dude. I dont know if youre fuckign reading this but man. I Actually did think you were my friend. I took up for you when no one else did. I laid down the law when everyone was talking about "" Tommy is such an asshole. Tommy needs to leave the band"" now after all that I still tried to take up for you. And the songwriting. Well GEE fucking thanks tommy. I write most of the stuff anyways. And if you think its unoriginal then fine. Be it. The hardcore scene itself is unoriginal. But you. You dont have any room to talk. You were always going ""No no no... We should put a (Haste the DAy, Underoath, MAe, Hopesfall, Norma Jean, Daughters) Riff here."" Now whos being unoriginal? Most of my riffs were just 80's metal riffs I wrote. I didnt rip my riffs off of other bands. Atleast I Didnt try to. Moreover, Replying to your last couple lines. I did have lots of respect for you as a friend and as a musician. But the time comes when it doesnt matter what ""I"" say. This band wasnt just ""My"" band so what did you want me to do about it huh? Im sorry you feel as though I did something awful to you. Because I tried to do my best to take up for you. You can ask anyone else in the band. But what youve said has shown me that you didnt ever think I was your friend. and that you just thought i was an egotistical asshole. Well my last words to you are this:

Tommy, you have an amazing gift an talent. I never would have figured you stayed in the band as long as you did because you always seemed to want to play something else other than hardcore. Your talents went beyond that but you stayed and I commend you for that. Now your agressive attitude and brashness were rather...uneccessary, but I just ignored most of it when it came around. I actually really hope your future endeavors are good. I Actually always pictured you joining APK or something. I thought that would have been pretty kool. I know we've had many fights no necessarily between you and I but band wise. I dont know why you cant see that I 95% of the time took up for you. Did I ever say anything mean to you? Did I ever yell at you? DId I not pick up the phone on p urpose? (I hve sucky network coverage) I tried my best as  a friend. Now I just hope you have a good life. 

Now having siad that. I know he'll probably never read my lj but what ev. Im just kind hurt he sid those kind of things about me, just because this whole time when the band has been talking about tommy, I STILL have been taking up for him. Well to change subject. My grandmother is pretty sick. She might have cancer in many spots. My parents at the moment are in NJ hoping she will be ok, but no matter what she doesnt have much time to go on living. She has cacner in so many spots that eve if it isnt cancer, they have to do some major surgery on that tissue. At best she could have anywhere between 1 to ten years to live and at worse case scanario she has 6 to twelve months to live. but the strange part about it is that. My father, I would have expect to see him in tears. but when he told me he was just laying back in the chair.. NOw I dont know if he was trying to stay strong or what, but I know if someone told me my parents were going to die (No matter how m uch they have made me mad in the past) I would be crying. I commend my father for his strength.

Other things that have happened this past month or so. I fucked up my car hitting a damned curb the whole front axel is busted. Theres nothing I can really do about it other than maybe get a new car. It be too expensive to actuall fix it. So ive had a cr for almost two months and now i dont have one. It sucks to have something and be used to it and then not have it at all. I hate having to resort to getting rides everywhere again.

Along with that my parents keep on fighting. This fight has gone on for so long (ten years) I dont know how long I can take it. They are constantly arguing and fighting. I mean yes allot of my friends have divorced parents but i never really thought it would happen to my self. It just seemed to far fetched. But now I dont really know. Ive been so freaked about everything these days. 

I just dont know what to do anymore. Im sick of sitting at home with no one really to talk to. Im tired of being there for people and getting crap back. Im really really tired of having to stress about everything. as Ive said before ""Wouldnt it be easier to be an asshole to everyone instead?"" I am as nice as I can be to most people. I give peopel so many chances its not even funny, but now that I see this crap. I really really really dont know. People give me more and more of a reason to hate them. And I dont hate anyone.

I say ""Fuck You!""

Sincerely,
Mr. Kai

P.S. If I could. I would have given up on humanity eons ago."

"event","Man, its been a while since i updated this infernal thing. Anyway, whats up everyone. Im doing alright as of late. Im balancing two bands. INVU and A Bullet away. I hope to get to recordwith INVU soon so we can get some progress. Tho its getting frustrating with all the constant arguments at band practice. I really hope we pull through t his, I dont want to see another band go down the drain pipes. On a lighter note. I think we are submitting out demo to HFS. A Bullet Away hopes to play the HFStival Big Break. I dont know if we'll make it but oh well. No skin off my back. Our demo is almost done. I really want to get outta the studio so INVU can go in and record their stuff because its alittle more up beat. I can actually head bang to it. But alas, i have to wait until ABA is finished recording. I love ABA but I think that maybe perhaps its putting pressur eon them that maybe somewhere down the line I might be leaving the band. I love the members of the band but I dont know if i could se emy self getting signed playing a more radio-esque sound. I like heavy metal, hardcore, industrial, emo and Visual Rock. I dont know what to do right now, everyones looking at me wondering if im leaving today or tommorrow, I dont know why. I told em id give em a year, but If they get signed under that amount of tie, im afraid ill have to cut my time with them, short. I dont want to but I love INVU allot. I dont think i c ould part ways with them. They are the closest thing I have to playing heavy  music. I really want to be in a J-rock band but I know that will never happen. Being Half asian, and well...over here on the east coast. Someday maybe...Right now im just kinda writing as much music as i can. I cant wait to play another show. Im going through show withdraw, lol. Its only been a couple weeks but I got acustomed to havimg a show ever week or every other week. It was very fun. I cant wait to tour. Anyway, enough of my ranting. Thats about wher ei am right now ill try and post more frequently, sorry.

"event","Well everyone, its official I will be in battle of the bands twice. Once as a Drummer and another as a Gutiarist. I will be playing Drums for AiP and Guitar and Vocals for I.N.V.U. I hope to do well this year. Last year was jinxed. Dumb sound dude. Ah well. I hope they dont use him this year. Im going to a funeral tomorrow, some place in NJ. Mrs. Josephine died...I knew her pretty good. More so as a child. She was really nice to me. I wish I talked to her before she passed. my mom is so stressed, she freaked on me few minutes ago. I hate it when she yells, and all I wanted to know is when i could have band practice. Jeez...Its so stupid, with menapause and all that gay crap, her being sick, it just gets worst and worst. She treats me like I dont know anything now adays. Just because im 18 doesnt mean I dont know whats right and whats wrong. How can you teach your kid one thing but do the complete opposite to them. I just hope when I have a kid im a better parent. I atleast hope one of my kids have my logic. Anyways. Yea. Im praying the show on the 15 goes well. I dont usually think about things like that but its my first show with this band and well. I just want to impress at least one person. If more, then hey thats a plus. Right now im trying to find a way to lower the strings on my V. I hate standing around in the cold. Walking is one thing but standing around doing nothing is boring and the wind hurts my face. Its like icy claws scratching at my skin, I dont know how to describe it any better than that. I released two albums a while back, well since the last time i poste don this thingy. I still miss  johnny cash. I am doing a cover of hurt on my next release. I hope you guys will like it. Also the show is at Renzo's in Silver Spring, MD. If anyone reading this wants to go, the details are as follows:

Renzos @ Silverspring, MD.
8PM 5.00 Dollars at the Door.
INVU, First.
I'd Rather Die, Second
Love in the Time of Cholera, Last. They rock dont miss out.

If you have any questions just talk to me. Leave a message here or something, or if you know my SN dont hesitate to ask. Anyway. After that we will be attending the Battle of the Bands. I hope I get b est guitar or best vocals. Neither will probably happen but I pray it will. Last year I got best nothing. Aka. I didnt win jack. lol. The sound guy screwed up the monitors so we couldnt hear a damned thing. Well anyway, i dont mean to digress, but the info for the show on the 24th is thus:

Battle of the Bands (Kaiju Battel!!! j/k!).
Maryland Hall @ Annapolis.
January 24th. 
Time and Bands TBA.

Then the next month over we have a show at woods. I'm sure most of you know what woods is. Its a church place in Severna Park where a bunch of bands get to play. Usually a pretty ok place. If your not being pestered by 14 year old kids who think they can kick your ass. Lol. The whole mallxcore crowd hang there too. You know who you are. j/k. Anyway. We will be playing there the 20th. Heres the info I know so far.

Woods Holy Grounds Church @ Severna Park
Feb. 20th.
7:00 PM 7 Dollars at the Door.
INVU all other bands TBA.

So basically if you happen to live in the area I honestly think you should attend. Even if Hardcore or Emo isnt your style, it be nice to see some familiar faces. Also on that note. When we get all the info. If possible could some of you make some flyers and pass them out. They can be as ghetto as index cards with the info on it, but it would be nice to promote the show. We wanna see allot of people at these shows. lol. Hmmm, anyway. What did you guys get for christmas. Kai got a nice wireless system for his guitar and a wireless mic from his awesome sister. (Yes I talked in third person! IM NOT CRAZY!! INSTITUTION!) I also got two stereos. Which rocks my socks. I got a hat and some clothes. Drumsticks, some music and some other stuff. My mind is going in circles...ok...well where was I. OH YEA! You guys need to go out to jpophouse.com and get the new Dir en grey album. v u l g a r. Its awesome, heavy and full of good stuff. But anyways, get it! Its really good. Also. I wish you guys a happy new year. Have fun this year. I know last year sucked like hell for me. lol. Appendix n stuff. Anyway. Talk to you all later Ive talked enough. BAI!!!!

"event","Man, its been a hard week for everyone. Two of my good friends have lost their g/fs. Two have lost their jobs. I on the other hand worry about a close friend of mine. Ricky. He has some sort of tumor/cancer. That cannot be cured. The first docotr he went to about it, last year, said ""Its a pulled muscle."" Oh how wrong he was. The next doctor he went to said ""Your intestines are protruding through your stomach muscle."" and yet again he was wrong. The next doctor said ""Your intestines might be twisted."" wrong again. The last docotr finally found out what it was ""Its a tumor."" well. They thought it might have been curable but its not. The good news is tho is can kill ricky. Most people can get it undercontrol and not have to worry about it. But I hope thats the case for ricky. I couldnt imagine seeing him gone. He is one of the koolest people I have ever met. AS much as he can be a pain in the ass sometimes. He likes to be. (lmao, that sounded so gay.) I just hope he'll be ok. I have been very uneasy about this the past couple of days. I dont know what to think, because of the many others I've lost in the past. So if you happen to talk to me online, or see me some place. I might be alittle dismal. There are some family issues going down and with ricky being sick. Its gonna be a long road outta hell."

"event","been a while since i've last posted on here so i guess i'll give an update on whats been happening with me these days. school will be done after next week. really excited about that. its been a horrendously tough semester for me, workload-wise and travel-wise. The good news is i've managed to create some decent paintings and drawings that i'll be including in my portfolio. i'm also in a new band. i auditioned for lead guitarist for a band out of syracuse, got in, and now i have to learn their entire catalog by Dec. 12th which will be my first show. the music is great and it includes some synth stuff and a horn section, complete with midgets doing handstands. also, one of my sculptural pieces was selected to be displayed in the Delavan Art Gallery in Syracuse so i'm really happy about that. 

     this weekend is going to be hectic. i have soooooo much work to do on my final projects which include making plaster and resin casts derived from skin wax molds taken from my hand. i've managed to pull off all the hair on my right arm in the process,so in effect some of my dna has been incorporated into the finished casting. kind of gross but i'm sure k-dubs will fawn over the ""organic contribution"" i've made to it. I also have to complete a life-size full body self-portrait that needs to be done on paper at least 6 foot long. where the fuck am i gonna find that? 

     anyway, right now i am searching for internships in the city for next summer. i need to do one to graduate but i'm not really sure where i'd want to apply yet. i guess i'll find one soon enough. i can't wait. other than that I am really excited for Christmas this year. My little niece Isabella is getting so big, and she is too fucking cute for words. I am gonna spoil that kid rotten. oh! and if anyone reading this would like to receive a handmade Christmas card email me your address so i can send out one to you. my email is ummwellactually@hotmail.com.
well i must make like a tree and get the fuck outta here ciao!"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been seriously considering becoming a Forensic Sketch Artist lately. The NYPD came up to my school this past week with recruiters and I realized that a job like that not only would be helping people in the public sector but also it would give me a chance to utilize my talents for good. They had a free police exam for the NYPD yesterday at SU and I missed it but I think perhaps next fall they'll be holding it again and I will take it then. Lately I've been pondering going into that field or getting my masters in Medical Illustration. The whole art teacher thing I feel is good in its merits but it's a profession not exactly in high demand these days. I'm not going to completely rule the possibility out though.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyhow, I had the worst week of school last week. The work load in every single one of my classes is unrealistic. I don't wanna sit here and sound like a lazy cunt but every single one of my Professors seems to be under the impression that somehow their class is the only one I am taking and therefore, assigning projects from conception to finish that are due in a week and a half, is perfectly acceptable. This of course isn't that awful in it itself but put that in conjunction with the fact they also assign detailed 15 minute Power Point presentations that we must do to go along with it for every project, plus a required 6 hours of mandatory logged studio time outside of actual class, and you've got yourself one pissed-off student who can't see the point. My biggest qualm is that I don't understand how inundating us with an impossible work load is allowing us to develop any of these ideas into good quality works. Mind you, I'm majoring in Studio Art and not Illustration, where strict deadlines aren't something that you deal with. Its fucking ridiculous.  At Pratt, which is actually an art school, I never had deadlines or projects that were given out in this capacity. I mean, 5 or 6 projects a semester is reasonable and allows the student to actually do a good job. I am gonna have almost twice that amount this semester at Cazenovia and I barely get a chance to wrap my head around the subject matter. I get no sleep during the weekdays, and add to that 2 hours every day being stuck in my car commuting to school, and I have no time to create any independent works of art to build my portfolio. 
ahh fuck it. I have a year and a half to go. It'll be worth it in the end. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So on the brighter side of things, they just announced that ""The Office"" is gonna have a Utica, NY branch of Dunder-Mifflin that is gonna be a part of the new season. How cool is that? I love that fucking show. Also, I got a brand new laptop that can actually play flash-based video and not look like someone filmed the movie with strobe lights. The ibook goes up for sale on ebay soon and i can't wait to get rid of it. Other than that, I am also coming to the BKN next weekend to visit. Should be fun. So I guess I'll have that to look forward to as I am still up at 3 a.m. building a sculpture out of jello&nbsp; and plexi-glass thats due in 4 hours. Yippee!"

"event","So I am sitting in what has to be the noisiest fucking library i've ever been in. These two girls in here won't shut the fuck up and some guy in the adjacent room is carrying on a conversation in a loud, ecstatic voice that sounds like Mario Cantone discussing subject matter that is equally as gay. I feel like I've somehow stumbled on to the set of ""The View"". 
     Also, I am bloated because I decided to splurge a bit today and treat myself to a foot-long sub at subway. I told myself that was all I would order but when the sandwich artist asked if I wanted to make it a meal I decided, ""why not?"" So I sat, read the paper, and ate the whole fucking thing, even getting up to get a refill on my drink. Its amazing what you'll do when you have a 7 and a half hour break between classes and it makes more economical sense not to drive the hour back home.
     I am glad Fall is right around the corner. Not so much because the leaves change color and the days grow shorter, but because it allows me to be able to wear something other than flip-flops and remain comfortable. Also i won't need to roll down the windows in my car so i won't arrive to class looking like I just ran a marathon.
     Oh, this is nice. Previously mentioned, obnoxiously loud girls, have decided that the library is an appropiate place to try and record their own personal ringtones into their phones. They are shouting ""Hey! K,K,K,KEEYA!"" into their phones over and over again. Then they are playing them back, each time giggling loudly because you know, the word ""KEEYA"" is funny. Then the other girl decides that the previous recording wasn't good enough and that the other girl should try again.
      Ok, I'm outta here."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well school started up this week. it feels great to be back. everyone seems to be really cool so far and cazenovia is a cute little college town. i'm taking a sculpture class this semester and it'll be the first time i've taken one since i've previously only taken drawing and painting classes. hopefully i will enjoy it and not learn to loathe it like the 3d class i had to take at Pratt. The only downside to everything is that i drive an hour each way to get to school and the gas is gonna kill me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So anyway, apparently Adrien Brody the actor just moved here to central NY. Everyone in this area has been talking about how they've spotted him at the local Walmart and at local furniture stores buying shit. That's kinda cool. He reportedly bought a castle-type home next to Oneida Lake. Why he would pick up here to live is beyond me but I guess we have some nice shit to look at when it comes to the outdoorsy stuff.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i need to start cooking more again. i've lost the eagerness to cook that i used to possess. i need ideas for new dishes to try and make. to anyone reading this, do you have any suggestions?"

My astigmatism, specifically in my right eye, has progressed to the point where i'm gonna be needing custom contact lenses now. I didn't realize I was becoming blind haha. I thought at age 27 my eyes would have stopped worsening myopically but apparently not. Thats alright though. I recently cut my mop of Leif Garrett-styled hair off and now i look like a fucking monkey so that gives me something else to be upset about. And this humidity!   5 minutes after I've dried off from my shower it feels like i've somehow magically taken another. It's gross."

"event","Man! I finally finished practically rebuilding my car's brakes, and suspension system these past 2 weeks. This was all due to the fact it failed the NY state safety inspection, a safety inspection which in some other states doesn't even exist. So tomorrow I'm making an appt. with another garage to have inspect it and I'm sending my mom to bring it in. I figure if they wanna be dicks about anything i might have missed fixing, she can persuade them to pass it. She's a pretty lady and it's worked before for inspections i've failed in the past, it should work again haha. 

     Anyway, I realize i don't post much on LJ these days. i just don't have much to say is all. I do however have to vent my frustration about something I read today concerning Mike Bloomberg's chances for the presidency if he decided to run. The article cites that he, being from NY, an independent,and Jewish might hurt his chances should he decide to run. personally, I don't care if he does or not. It was just the topic of the article that got to me. I don't know what angered me more about the ""points"" they raised. The fact that i realize people are still that fucking racist about having a Jew in the President's office that they would simply not want to vote for him, or the fact that he's from New York. So I guess I'll address the whole ""being from NY"" issue as i feel that point is one of the reasons why we have a problem now with the current presidency. Let me just say: People of America, stop electing dumb fucking southerners. I'm tired of the whole ""good 'ole boy"" favoritism the voting public seems to have when it comes to electing Presidents. People think if they can see themselves racing a pick-up truck and drinking natty ice with a guy who sounds as if he came straight out of the cast of extras from ""Deliverance"" he'll be able to do a good job running our country. It somehow makes him ""down to earth"" and ""aware of the problems the real people in this country are concerned about.""  I'm sorry, maybe this offends some people reading this. I don't dislike southerners. I just dislike southern politicians. Just stay home in Jow-Ja and tend to your family's 250 year old formerly slave-staffed Plantation and let the rest of the country find someone else better suited for the job. So yeah, that's just my rant. Albeit, a very grammatically deficient and poorly typed one. It just feels good to get this stuff off your chest though, y'know?"

"event","Lot of things on my mind tonight which is probably why I'm still up at 2:30 in the morning. First off, my older sister delivered a beautiful baby girl she named Isabella tonight and i was there in the hospital while she was in labor. of course, i wasn't there to witness the actual birth cuz thats just,well,gross. But i was glad to be there in the waiting room to show my support. Anyhow, I got to hold her and she felt so wonderfully small in my arms. I told her that i was her favorite uncle because i was gonna teach her how to play guitar and draw. I think she'd have agreed with me if only it weren't for the fact she was only about 45 minutes old and incapable of comprehension.

     Also, I'm gonna be in NY for the weekend which i'm excited about. I would be taking my car but last weekend i discovered that one of my brake lines was leaking so guess who had to buy a crappy train ticket instead? I love my Grand Am but the fucking thing always has something go wrong with it every 3 weeks. Luckily i have been able to keep up with the repairs by DIY'ing but its been un-seasonably cold outside and i don't feel like getting out there to quickly repair said damage. I also have to shell out an extra $200 tuition/housing deposit for cazenovia by the end of the month as well, so that sucks too. 
 
     I'm obsessed with playing Tiger Woods PGA Tour '07 on PC lately. I just can't wait till it gets warmer out to actually play real golf. Maybe this year I'll actually be able to drive the ball toward the hole I'm playing on and not the one next to it. Of course it doesn't help that by the 5th hole i'm already plastered and dehydrated from all the beer we bring with us in the cart.

     I'm also planning to sell my iBook. I've begun to hate that fucking thing. It can't play video, especially web video, worth a shit. It's like watching some digital zoetrope with missing frames in it. After much research it seems this is a common problem with the G3 models no matter how much more RAM I shove into it. Which, apparently will cost twice as much as a PC equivalent stick of the same memory value. Fucking ridiculous. 

     Anyway, its time for bed. goodnight"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, so a few things I'm changing about myself. I'm quitting smoking. That's a nasty habit i got into this fall that I've had a hard time kicking. Also, I am bleaching my teeth with white strips to get them back to the pearly whites i had before i started smoking. hmm, what else? oh yeah,i need to stop cutting my hair. its a compulsion. i let it grow out a little bit and i think "" oh, well this looks good"" then i get bored and decide to ""trim"" it a little to liven it up. well a couple of hacks later with my hair razor and i end up cutting it all off. Then i have to start all over again. except this time, i had  this great idea to dye a patch of my front silver and it looked neat for all of 5 days until i grew tired of it. at that point, my hair was already damaged in that spot from the multiple bleachings and i just decided to cut if all off. stupid me. its these long, cold northern winters which cause me to do such things. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also, i can't wait for this Monday for when my replacement iBook arrives . I had to send the original back to Other World Computing because the logic board failed 3 days into owning it and they ended up just shipping me out a completely different iBook this week.  It was cheaper for them instead of trying to replace the LB. My thoughts on this are that i hope i get lucky and the LB doesn't go out on this one but having read the horror stories people have shared with their LBs going out on their iBooks, it seems all of them on the G3s are doomed. But fuck it, i love them anyway. I plan on getting Garage Band and then using that to create musical masterpieces from the comfort of my bedroom. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so yeah, thats it for now."

"event","Good news! i start classes next Monday at Cazenovia. They were really nice about accommodating me for late registration. the financial aid package they gave me was also excellent so i am pretty happy about not having to take out extra private loans this time around. anyhow, i spent most of today running around with the transfer admissions counselor meeting everyone and taking care of all the loose ends which means i had to shake a lot of hands. thing is, I've recently been working on my car a lot, replacing the exhaust system as well as fixing the engine and I've managed to soil my hands pretty heavily and bang them up pretty good in the process. i must have scrubbed with a bottle of GOJO and a nail brush a total of 5 times last night in an attempt to try and get them completely clean. That was just so it didn't look like i picked up my last meal from the dumpster behind Denny's and beat up a homeless person in the process. Of course, you should've seen the looks on the people's faces today when i had to sign paperwork in front of them and when i shook their hands. I've included a picture of my right hand for you to see just what it is i am talking about. it actually looks better than it did earlier today, as I've once again scrubbed another 3 times to rid myself of the residual grease. enjoy!

"event","I found out this Friday that i got accepted by Cazenovia. Of course it isn't as exciting as i would have hoped it would have been to get into a new school. Withdrawing from Pratt was a major pain and I must say after having to deal with 6 different departments just to simply fill out a withdrawal form I am glad to be done with them. Now that I've gotten accepted at caz, there's a whole slew of complications. namely, they want all the tuition due to them by this Monday. There's a little problem there seeing as my financial aid package hasn't been completed yet by the fin aid dept and i seriously need to get registered for my classes next week. if worse comes to worse I'll have to wait till next fall to enter but that's alright. seeing as they have an articulation agreement with mvcc i will be starting as a straight junior along with my transfer credits from Pratt. this is good because I'll actually finish earlier even if i have to start there next fall which is still a shorter period of time than i would have finished if i stayed at Pratt. funny how that works."

We had to plow through the droves of tourists who thought it was appropriate to stand smack dab in the middle of unbelievable pedestrian traffic to figure out where they lost Grandma. Then when we finally got to Rockerfeller center to see the Christmas tree i felt like punching out every one of them. 
     School is over in 2 weeks. I can't wait! Its been a tough semester for me personally. Since I changed my major to Art education next semester i will be doing student teaching all days on Mondays and Tuesdays for the entire semester. That ought to be interesting. I just hope i get an elementary class.
    anyway, its Christmas time and i really need to see some snow. like real snow. Hence, i am very excited to go back home for the break to hopefully get a healthy dose of it. also, i need to ingest copious amounts of egg nog, bake cookies, and gift shop. although this year, i might end up making all my gifts from some Elmer's glue and macaroni, we'll see. i might also try creating a nice Christmas card to send out this year. i wonder how much it would cost to have them professionally printed. anyone know? tell me if you do.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been thinking lately that i want to cut my hair short again. it's grown out a bit to the flippies stage with the intention of letting it grow out even longer. now it just looks flat and lifeless. Combine that with the fact that it makes me look 15 and it's time to go with something nicer. I want to cut it myself like i usually do but I need help with cutting the back since i don't have a large enough mirror to see the back with. I want to get it cut somewhere in the city preferably. I'll&nbsp;have them use a razor and maybe have some European person do it. They always seem to know what looks cool.&nbsp;
I also need to buy some fitted blazers. i don't like the ones I find at the usual places. they always are cut more genrously and i don't want to look like a a college professor. So maybe this weekend i'll do a bit of shopping.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally got our internet up and running today. Apparently the fucker that was here last week fucked around with the wiring and in all that effort never managed to go outside to the box and switch our DSL on. Luckily today we had someone competent enough to realize that and repair it.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want an Ipod. Probably will buy the nano since i wouldnt be able to fill up a 30 gigger. I'm also really impressed with the new Imacs that are out. They just installed some at school and i have to admit they're damn sexy.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm also dually excited because i just did my degree audit for my current major which is Illustration and did a mock one for an Art and Design education degree.&nbsp;What i found is that i can switch to Art ed. and still only need the same amount of credits to graduate at the same time.&nbsp;even better, i won't have to continue taking these bullshit classes like the one i just complained about. Instea dI'll be taking education type coursework. Plus if i work my ass off i'll be able to graduate in the fall of 2008. if i take summer classes then it'll be even earlier&nbsp;in the spring 2008.&nbsp;

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So i'm taking this class called Communications Imaging this semester and I hate it. mainly because i am not a photographer by any means and the instructor just enjoys listening to himself speak. It's absolutely bullshit. So anyway, our first project assigned was to create a photo book with the subject matter being anything we liked. naturally, thats a broad spectrum of things to choose from and the same day he assigned it to us he made us choose what we were going to photograph right on the spot. Some people had really good ideas and myself, thinking of interesting things i might like to photograph i chose cooking as my subject matter.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, yesterday we had to critique the photos we've taken so far in class. some kids had brilliant pictures and i really liked their ideas. they ranged from city life to one kid photographing junk food. and with every student's work the teacher insisted on going through the entire class and asking each other student in the class what their opinion was. it was ridiculous. we spent close to a half hour on each person. and it wasn't consctructive. he's from south america so he has this latin passion thing going on whenever he talks about anything and he would just go off on tangents that were completely irrelevant to the discussion. Everytime he asked me my opinon on a person's work i'd give it and then he would just sort of look at me like i had no idea what i was talking about. did he do this with the other students? nope. he praised their observations. anyway, he more or less stopped calling on me after 3 or 4 examples.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we got to mine he looked disgusted and confused. right off the bat he started tearing it apart. i wasnt inventive enough. i wasnt being creative. all that was fine. like i said, i dont give a shit about being a photographer. i'm a fucking illustrator and being critiqued is part of my education. but what pissed me off was the fact he went out of his way to say ""i dont even know what it eez you are doing"" he didnt like my subject matter of food apparently. which is fucked up seeing as someone else in the class photographed just candy. last time i checked, they too are a food item. I had a picture of some ingredients like onions, and carrots. he was like: "" if you show an onion, treat it like you are photographing a loved one. really show the viewer how you feel about the onion."" At that point I was expecting him to&nbsp;start gyrating&nbsp;his hips and say something&nbsp; like: "" <em>feeeeel</em> the onion. make <em>loooove</em> to the onion""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so yeah, now i have to come up with something new. i dont want to pursue the cooking anymore only to have this fucker give me a shit grade. so does anyone reading this have good ideas? it can be anything. i just need something interesting and i can't think of anything. the project is due next friday which means i have to hustle. we have to make the book like 15 pages long. i'm hoping on the next project he decides to give us more time to actually consider what we want to photo instead of making us committ to an idea 5 minutes after he handed out the fucking assignment. ass."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm really considering buying a motor scooter to commute back and forth from school. I remember back in the 80's when I was really little, I had this babysitter named Sandra who dated this guy named ""Fly"" who'd come over to hang out with her while she baby sat us. He was a weasely looking fella' who bore a striking resemblance to Weird Al Yankovic, complete with the trademark mustache, hair,&nbsp;and glasses. Anyway, he'd always show up in this snazzy red scooter and if we begged him enough, he'd take use for a spin around the block on it.&nbsp; At 5 years old, I thought that was about the coolest thing in the world next to finding a M.A.S.K. hologram ring in a box of King Vitamin cereal.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyhow, now that I've been riding around my bike to get to and from places here in Brooklyn I've been looking to alternative modes of transportation for when I'm feeling a bit lazy. Seeing as scooters are small enough to bring inside the apartment when not in use and the fact they often get 60-80 miles per gallon, I'd say it is a viable and economical solution to my growing reluctance to pedal my ass off to class every morning. They're also relatively cheap to buy and even cheaper to insure.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows, maybe I'll start a scooter riding chapter in Crown Heights. Whose with me?"

"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So much for the first day of classes! I showed up 15 minutes early for my one and only class today which was World Civilizations I. Well, the entire class waited for 45 minutes for the instructor to show up and she never did. Then, we were told by a faculty member who had gone to investigate the absence of our teacher, that the liberal arts dept. didn't know where our instructor was and that we were allowed to leave. Since the next time our class meets is next Monday and seeing how we have next Monday off for Labor day, it'll be 2 weeks before we even meet again for that class. Fucking crazy. Anyway, it wasn't raining so I was grateful for that while riding my bike back home. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in the mood to decorate my room a little bit. It looks a bit dull. I'm on a budget so I don't have many options. One thing I do need to buy is one of those carts with the 2 wheels and cage you can use to schlepp around your groceries or a bag of laundry. Target has one for 24.95 but Wal-Mart also has the same exact one for 14.95. ahh Wal-Mart, I miss you and your cheap prices. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've managed to find one annoying thing about my apartment and that's the lack of pressure in the shower head. There's basically none. It sort of pours instead of sprays. My hair looks flat and lifeless. I think maybe I'll look for a new shower head that has a pressure build-up system of some sort as a solution. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;guess it's time to venture out and pick up a few items I need. I'm considering going out one of these days and busking with my guitar for a few dollars in the subway stops. Anyone care to join me?</p>"

It makes me think of fall and until this summer, I never really looked forward to when the weather starts dictating the use of a light jacket to keep warm. I have this amazing pillow. It's so consistently soft night after night. I just want to bury my head in it and let the cool breeze drift in from the open windows enough to make me shiver. I remember when I was a kid and I couldn't sleep. I'd lean over from my bed and hunch over the window sill. I'd press my face against the screen and stare at the dark sky. I'd look at the moon and wonder who else in the world was staring at it at that very same moment. And then I'd just listen. Listen to the sound of all the crickets and distant noises that surrounded me outside my window until I got so bored I'd inevitably lay back down and fall asleep. Life is good."

How the fuck is it that, just one country can be responsible for the dramatic rise and fall of oil prices when you can cocurrently read another headline stating reason # 5,733 this year of why gas has gone up. Before this bullshit in iran was even happening, we still had ridiculous costs for oil. I think something's rotten in Denmark and its not a 10 day-old pastry. I just want to kick every oil executive right in the face with a pair of their own golf cleats at this point. Remember the good old days when ""going for a drive"" was something you did when you were bored because well, it was affordable? Now I groan everytime I need to drive out to Wal-mart because I just realized we've ran out of toilet paper. I'm sick of the paper-thin excuses, the corrupt committees created to investigate the obvious price gouging whose findings always conclude with ""it is fair competitive market practices"" which are causing the rise in cost, and the fucking president telling us how greedy we are for filling up our cars with our insatiable greed for the very thing, that allows us to get to fucking work to pay his salary. Fuck you Exxon Mobil, Shell, Citgo and all you other assholes in control of the stock market.

"event","So I caught ""X-Men 3"" today at the theater and my thoughts on it? I think Fox should've waited for Bryan Singer to have completed work on Superman to come and direct this. I think Brett Ratner is better suited to direct another ""rush hour"" sequel than to succesfully carry a film franchise that was on its way to getting even better. I would say X2 was far superior in its pacing and story. On the whole, X-3 wasn't an awful film but I felt that they sort of skimmed over major plot elements and rushed everything a bit. On a side note though, my favorite character in the film series has got to be Storm. Whereas it takes anyone else a  matter of seconds to utilize their powers in battle it seems to take a good 20 seconds and a bit of special theme music for Storm to even open up a door with her mutant abilities. I get a kick out of that.     
Anyhow, I've taken up playing golf lately. I got a beautiful brand new set of clubs from my mom as an early birthday present recently and i love them. I totally suck at it too. Last week I managed to drive my hole 3 ball off the tee and into the adjacent hole's fairway which was behind me. I can't explain how I did it but I can tell you I swung that motherfucker hard. 
    So tomorrow is memorial day and this means the offical season of BBQ and nights sitting around a bonfire have begun. I can't wait. I also can't wait to take some trips into the city and having some fun with nayomi as well. I'm setting a goal for myself this summer too. I need to drop 20 pounds before I even get near a pool. I'm beginning to become so self conscious of my beer belly that I'm looking into getting a girdle in the meantime. Ok, Thats a lie. It's not THAT bad, but joining a gym sounds like a good idea lately. Anyone reading this know of a good diet thats given them some results. please let me know."

"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"" align=""left"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man It's day 2 of Spring. Can you believe it? It's still cold outside and snowy. Despite the current conditions though, the idea that it is indeed officially Springtime now has got me thinking of all the Spring/Summer projects I plan to accomplish this year. First off: building an oil drum BBQ. I've always wanted to build of one of those Texas Hibachis. I love charcoal grilling. The taste, the smell, the ritual of lighting that fucker up and watching the flames. I need to find a discarded oil drum somewhere that I can saw in half and paint a NASCAR racing stripe down the side of. Perhaps I can take a trip down somewhere on the east-side and confiscate one from some homeless people huddled around it. I wouldn't be mean about it though. I'd at least throw them a pack of matches to substitute for warmth. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other project I want to do is make a backyard fire pit. I suppose I could just buy one of those at Home Depot and save myself the time but that wouldn't be as fun now would it? Chimineas are cool too. I'd prefer to make one of those myself but the fact that I don't have like a 100 pounds of clay laying around and a 900 degree kiln to bake it in, sort of puts a cork on that idea. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I just really want to spend a lot of time outdoors this year. There's a boat sitting in the back of my driveway that me and my brother still need to repair the motor on. That would be cool to finish fixing. Although I have a feeling if we took it out on Lake Ontario on a windy day, we might never end up making it back on shore. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyhow, I'm craving chili. I think I'm going to go cook a pot of red now. </p>"

"event","So I went to my doctor the other day only to find out that apparently I've gained like 20 lbs since this past May when I last saw him. I weigh a whopping 195 lbs. now. I don't think I've ever weighed this much in my entire life!! I just have one question: where the fuck is it? Honestly, I don't look any different physically that I can see or that anyone else can for that matter. Sure, I have a little pot belly but I've had that since like 1998. I'm 6'0"" and apparently 195 lbs is a bit overweight for my height. To top it all off, I was also told that I have high cholesterol, which I was aware of last year but they're also now telling me that my tri-glyceride levels are also very high. I feel like I'm 45 years old being told all this stuff. I suppose I can blame the mass consumption of slim jims, red meat and complete stir-fried meals at 3 a.m. Still though, I used to eat like that for years and I still always came in at like 155 on the scale. So now I'm obsessed with losing all this weight and lowering my cholesterol. I'm actually taking prescribed pills to lower it as well. I need to exercise and change my eating habits to say the least. Its just so weird for me to have to count calories and all that shit. Anyway, I'm gonna have to stop thinking how nice it would be in theory to start lifting weights again and actually do it. I'm gonna gun for that stomach you could grate asiago cheese with. You just wait."

I forgot how much I appreciate the way briefs don't ride up on your thighs when you wear slimmer fitting pants. I also enjoy the secure fit that mary-kate and ashley get when I'm wearing them too. No danglies here. Just warm,cotton-soft, stable positioning that I can enjoy all day long. 
    So it's the Christmastime now and I am really excited about it this year. I need to drink more egg nog this Christmas too. The problem is those fucking greedy dairy farmers raised the price of it just like they've done with milk and which puts enjoying it at a premium. I wish wal-mart made their own generic brand so I could buy it for cheap. One thing I've noticed this year that's really pissed me off is the lack of Christmas light-set choices. I remember a few years ago when you could go into any department store and buy light-sets that could twinkle in 20 different patterns, play the ""ode to joy"" and offer dating advice for 10 bucks a set. Now all you get is your choice of either white or multi-colored lights that may or may not blink. What's up with that?"

"event","I was cleaning out my room the other day and eureka!! I found two un-opened packets of sleep-aides under my bed. amazing. It was like wearing a pair of pants you hadn't worn in a really long time only to find $20 in your pocket you had forgotten you stuffed in there 4 months ago.
    So anyway, I got really bored a little while ago and I took one. I feel incredibly euphoric now and suddenly i'm in the mood to do all sorts of things. Such as, posting in my livejournal. So how are you all? It's been a while, I know. I'm watching conan right now. there's this guy who tattoos ads for companies on his body for a nominal fee. It would be cool if he got money to tattoo an ad for like Campbell's chunky soup on his stomach or Castrol Syntec motor oil on his forearm. But then imagine how much it would suck if he was broke, desperate, and the makers of Astroglide approached him with 250,000.00 to tattoo an ad for them and the only available space left on his body was on his ass.
    Anyhow, my brother gave me the link to this funny clip on ebaumsworld.com that just happened to be taken from a local news station broadcast here in utica. check it out: <a href=""http://www.ebaumsworld.com/weatherman.html"">http://www.ebaumsworld.com/weatherman.html</a>"

"event","This Friday night fucking sucked! I took a nap after watching bill and ted's excellent adventure this afternoon and I had an excellent adventure of my own. yes, its true. I'm sorry I peed all over the carpet guys. I forgot that drinking lemonade does that. I realize this was not part of the Socratic method nor does it comply with ISO standards. so what?  stereophonics has a good vocalist. how can I get my voice like that? ahh yes. smoke 3 packs a day and pour whiskey over my cornflakes every morning. this weather has not been kind to my hair. nice and flat. no volume. I need the volume for the spikies to rise. rise spikies rise. Halloween is next week! can you believe it? what are you children going to be? remember, check for razor blades, plastic combs, and cyanide in your candy.

"event","WHOA!!!! Like today was actually nice!!! I had my button down shirt unbuttoned to the navel and i slathered wesson all over my chest. you like? of course you do.  i really need some new clothes. complete rejuvenation of johnny's old wardrobe. so i need to start reading a good book. anybody have any suggestions? i need to stimulate my mind. I think next quarter I'm going to register for a lot of lit/writing classes. I write like a 12 yr old these days. I used to be decent at writing too. I'm considering minoring in lit. not sure yet. either that or basket weaving.   
      anyway, there are so many thigns i can't wait for. like when this quarter ends, when I get to see my baby doll again, and when they finally start showing re-runs of ""beretta"" on nickelodeon. hopefully tonight will be fun. planning an evening out with erin and josh. should be a blast. hopefully no drunk asshole will comment on my jacket then tell me i look like a farmer from south dakota. motherfucker."

"event","man oh man, bill cosby where the fuck is mah jell-o puddin pops? fuck. i cant sleep. i think i did that already in tonight's art history lecture. so why am i talking about this class again? good point. shut the fuck up. i dont need you. thats right. you walk away. 
       ........................................i'd just like to give a shout out to anyone who was in or around perkins during the after hours of saturday 2 weekends ago. umm yeah. you stole our fucking grill and we want it back. perhaps you are hiding it amongst your collection of martha stewart towels or maybe even youve already spray painted to match your carpet. it doesnt matter. you dont own it. so you know what i'm gonna do? when youre grilling up that filet mignon with the money that mom and dad sent you and that you were to cheap to use to buy yourself your own grill, i'm gonna come over and spit on it.  no. fuck that. too easy.  instead, i'm gonna fucking eat it right in front of you and then i'll push your palms into the charcoals until you beg me to make the pain stop by urinating on your hands. yeah!
         So i Dl'ed that movie "" the girl next door"" today. i thought it was great. its like the director took the soundtrack listing from every celebrated soundtrack and threw them into every insignificant scene in the movie. the best part though was when the kid just goes beserk and takes out the janitor with the boat paddle. even funnier, is when he has sex with the quarterback by accident...sigh
I love teen movies"

"event","what is it about art history professors that brings to mind the mention of hidden sexual innuendoes in all works of art from antiquity? ahh yes, why that would be their insistence that anything respresenting a male or female figure suggests something overtly sexual. an example: in tonight's lecture my professor showed us slides of ancient greek statuettes in what amounted to stick figure scultpures which he explained were representational of a 15 yr old girl. Did I instantly identify the presence of suggestive sexual organs? no, but i guess now that you've pointed it out professor, I do see that those small bumps in the upper region represent small supple breasts and that triangle in the midsection is a vagina. fantastic! who needs hardcore internet porn when you can open up an art history book and jack off to  photos of the venus of willendorf!"

I apologize to:

-Kayla.
-Caitlin.
-Tegan.
-Schyler.

I guess that's all. God, I was bitchy. I was rude. I was cruel. And I'm feeling pretty terrible about it all right now. I seriously don't know why you kids put up with my shit for so long, cause I would have beat my little ass. It just sucks that it took me this long to figure out how mean I was to everyone. I'm glad I got arrested."

When I woke up today, I wasn't feeling too good. But I'm trying to do well in school, so I decided to go. Did my history test. And I think I did pretty alright on it =D. So, third period, I just figured ""Well, I'm not feeling well, and I won't be doing much for the rest of the day."" So I called my mom, and she let me go home. So if any of you were wondering where I went, there's your answer.

I really want to go to Concord this weekend and see Ray n' Dee. I don't know if I'll be able to or not, though. It all depends on if the Alley Cats win tonight. Schy, if I am able to go, and you wanted to, we could try and both go up there this weekend. And It'd be helluva good time.


And I think it's time for some serious Tate/Deakins hanging out."

"event","Ok, all I've done for the past week or so is just use this journal to bitch in. You really don't need to read this. It's just rambling, and I'll just feel a lot better after I type it out.

So yea, you really don't need to read it, but I won't stop you.



Nothing could go better in my life right now. I'm back in day school. I get to see all of my friends everyday. I'm going to get my license. I'm going to get a car. I've got a job. I've got my parent's trust back. I'm doing well in school, and I like that feeling.


Sounds great, right?

Then why the fuck aren't I happy?
Why have I been so sad over the past week? It just doesn't make sense. I'm supposed to make people laugh. I'm suppose to know all the right things to say. I'm not one to show vulnerability.

Yea, that's what I <b>thought</b>.

And here's what it is: A simple embarassment or unkindness will send me over the edge. And no, I'm not talking about suicide.

I don't know what I'm talking about, I'm just letting my fingers do the talking.

I'm tired of these mind games. I lust to get my little routine, predictable days back. Where nothing unexpected happened. Where I didn't have to worry. Where I didn't have the responsibility. ""You're a fuck up. I don't expect much.""

I don't know why I'm so stressed. None of this makes sense.

I'm the one that is supposed to take a step back and look at things reasonably. I could always find the sense in whats happening. And now I can't.

If everything is so perfect, why do I feel so terrible? I finally have everything I've dreamed about for years now, and I couldn't feel worse.

Why the <b>fuck</b> is this happening to me now?



I changed so much, and I still want something more. I thought I had it all, and nothing seems to feel right. Nothing seems to fit."

Here it goes:

Fucked up again and missed all the chances,
Headline news: ""Man of a Million Romances,""
On top of the world, still buried in shame,
His mind like a playbook in a dangerous game,

A few scribbled words and all the cliche lines,
""I'm here for you"" and ""It's gonna be fine,""

And aren't you just oh-so-clever?
The way you turned it all around,
And aren't I just oh-so-phisticated?
The way I make it so profound,

Now you watch it boil down,
Turn around to see the face,
Of Mr. World Renown."

So, school. Well shit. I haven't seen a lot of those kids in ten months. I've been back inside that school once in those ten months.

And yea, you guys probably don't understand the anxiety I have about it all. I mean, yea, I got in trouble, and I should just move on. Well, I haven't had the forgivness of anyone to move on. My parents haven't forgiven me. The teachers and principals haven't. All I've had was a few aquaintances, and just as many teachers telling me that I was shit. All I've had was disapproval. No one has bothered saying ""Don't worry, it's not the end of the world."" That's all I need to hear. That one little cliche phrase could make it all better for me.

So ok, right now, you're rolling your eyes. You're thinking ""He's making it worse than it all is.""

Which is true.

My ego is fickle. Easily lifted, and easily shattered. So the fact that I basically got completely fucked in the ass with punishment, then being told I was worthless on a pretty daily basis, doesn't help my ego in the least. And whats worse, was having no one to vent to. No one to call, no one to sit and talk with. And if I told you the reality of it all, you'd probably laugh.


Ok, I feel better now. Time to put my happy face back on. =]"

"event","Ok. So a couple nights ago I was in a mood. And this is the result:


Sing until your throat is dry,
Pull that stupid face,
Hold it 'til your mouth is wide,
Laugh until your eyes must cry,
Take her by the arm,
Hold it 'til you wipe your eyes,

But who gives a damn,
Cause we're living in perfection,
You'll never shatter this dream,
I won't let you touch it,
Cause this is the final paragon,
Of all my unspoken schemes,

You're all I need for this night,
You'll keep my sheets warm,
God, I know this isn't right,
You're a neverous wreck,
But try all you want,
I'll never love you,
You're all I'm gonna need,
when I kill the lights.


Anywhom. Please comment."

i cant take this seperation anymore. i mean really, if i died now, how long would it be till you knew? i cant take the isolation. all i want to do is have everything go my way, just for <b>one day</b>. i want to be in the place i want, with the people i want, doing the things i want. i dont want the competition, i dont want the egos. if you fuck it up, i want to blink and i want you to be gone. i want to be the center of attention without worrying about doing something stupid. i want to be what i always dreamed and never have been. just for one day i want, what <b>I  WANT</b>. this isnt fair to me. i never hurt anyone. all i did was follow the mindset that god gave to me.

"event","so... ive been thinking alot lately. about myself mainly. so here it goes.

ive been to seven different schools in my ten years of schooling. and i am always being forced to make new friends. so i think at a young age i taught myself to find common ground with everyone i meet. i think the phrase ""jack of all trades, master of none"" fits me almost perfectly. i have a hard time thinking about who is really me, cause im always being forced to change things about me. around some people ill be really quiet, and others i let myself out a little. around some people i act like more of a hardass and around other people i dont. 

ive tried my hardest to experience as much in my life as i can, so that ill always be able to connect with someone about something. i know there are definetly things i like more than others: music for instance. my favorite music is anything with an acoustic guitar, pretty much. but ive learn to like a few things out of all categories of music, so that i can have something in common with a person. i doubt theres anyone who could be complete opposites with me and couldnt find anything we have in common.

so im talking out of my ass right now but this is just some shit i needed to get written down...

anyways, its tough for me to find myself at times. thats pretty much all im trying to say. and ive never been able to stick with one group of friends. im constantly getting torn away from my friends for whatever reason. which brings up another point, i may be able to connect with people really well, but i <b>hate</b> doing it, cause i know eventually anyone i develope a relationship with will leave abruptly. and it always seems like they leave and the time when our friendship is strongest.

like last year, mark and zack were my best friends, and we were the oddest group you could ever find. not to label, but it was a prep, a redneck, and then me... whatever that might be. we knew things would change when we started at gw, we had even discussed it. i was up on the trail behind JA with zack and he said ""next years gonna suck, cause youve got your group of friends and ive got mine and marks got his."" so we got split apart.

then two years before that. i became friends with ryan and ed and all these 8th graders. then they all leave, and im stuck with pretty much complete strangers. 8th grade blew ass for me.

so zack and mark are gone, but i can make old relationships new again with all you cool kids, and even make some new ones, then BAM, i fuck up. gone to another school (so make that 8 schools, not 7.) so i make a friend or two their, and theyre gone a semester, make some more, theyre leaving march first. fuck all this. 

i guess what im saying is that i need to find some fucking solid ground. i need a place to plant my feet for a while. but hell, youll all be gone in 2 1/2 years then ill be stuck again with complete strangers. ill make friends with them, then im off to college.


damnit i hate this."

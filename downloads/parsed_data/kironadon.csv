I want to be friends.
I want Woz.
I want peace.
I want Dignity.
I want understanding.


I have
Two People, but I wouldn't give them up for the world.

Those two... They know who they are. Well sort of.

Heather + Jessie. The only people I need. I wish I had others. But I don't. I can get along with them. I love them. They are my friends. Forever more.

Why care about people, when they wont give you a thought?"

"event","This is from yesterday, when I was in my bed:

>>>Well today started off fairly well... Cousins came over, they're cute. Especially Sarah. Anyways, woke up around 9 and cleaned until 11:30, then I went ton the computer and talked to Shawn + Played GB with michelle unitl 4ish. I don't remember when I started talking to Ben, but when he said I was just using him for his GB account, I almost cried. If he thinks thats why I'm his friend then let him. I don't care right now. Whatever. Anyways the reason I'm in a bad mood is because of Josh. He was being such a jerk, I felt like slapping him. Then Morg tipped me over the edge. I am sooooo glad that Shawn left before all this happened, I would have been so mean to him, I know it. And the last thing I want right now is for him to hate me. I love him so much. Poor Steve too. I took it out on him, and again I go back to me not deserving to have any friends. I'm such a bad person. I wish I could be the scapegoat. I would sacrafice myself for the well being of everyone else hands down, no questions asked. Its just to rough. I want to give up, but I want to succed. I want to be successful. I am going to make a differece. 

I have a lot of apologizing to do tomorrow. I hope I can get through the day."

Man, this week is off to the worst start. The only good news I have is the fact that my mom came back Monday, and Jessie is coming over tomorrow.

Bad news- Ends up, I didn't get to go to see Finger Eleven with Ben. I was so dissapointed. I really wanted to go... Oh well I guess... We can do other things.

Bad news 2- Broke up with Shawn... Very depressing. I can't do anything right.

Bad news 3- Since my mom just got back, she's decided my dad needs a vacation! So she's taking him to Las Vegas... That's 4 Vacations for her within 6 months!! Like she was JUST at Hawaii. How unfair >>.

Yeah that's about it right now, hopefully nothing else bad happens. Don't think I could handle it."

Anyways, got back home talked to some people. Cody's back from I forget where (What a great friend I am). Yeah. Everyone's just happy so I'm really happy because everyone else is happy ^^. Today was Morgoth's birthday, but I never got to see him to give him the thing I made. Kind of depressing but oh well I'll see him later. Oh yes, Heather's dad got married today to ^^ I wish him and Lynne good luck with that and good luck to Heather too because her step sister/brother are wierd o_O, not good wierd either. Yeah anyways, Just read Nappa's Journal and hearing that he was happy just topped off my mood ^^"

"event","Wrote this early this morning in my notebook so I'm going to transfer it:

So here I am laying in my bed at 1:42 writing this. Why? Because I have 4 people on my mind that I want to talk to. Let me explain to you who they are and why:

Person number one: The Woz. Why? Because I wanna know how she's doing and what she's been up to. 

Person number two: Chris. Why? Because I love talking to him and he always puts me in a good mood, and I could really use one of those right now.

Person Number three: Steve.  I enjoy talking to him. He always has something nice to say. 

Yeah... Im j ust going to leave out the other person. They'd know who they are...;o"

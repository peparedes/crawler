But <a href=""http://good-times.webshots.com/photo/2866213000093643167ZhxoPL"">my dog</a> is pretty damn cute.&nbsp; And you can see my bling in that picture.&nbsp; Anyhow, I've been blah lately because of work, school, and life in general (hereafter refered to as LIG).&nbsp; I was supposed to go to Italia and visit my girl in Zee Swiss.&nbsp; But that didn't work out because of family baby mama drama, one of the many pitfalls of my LIG.&nbsp; But things are looking up.&nbsp; Because I've decided that I'm going to visit my homegirl in Zee Swizz and have a hell of a time.&nbsp; Because she's been one of my best buddies I've neglected because my LIG got in the way.&nbsp; I need to work on my writing, because as you can see from my last poems....I suck royally.&nbsp; I mean, I have a start but I suck at rewriting and freewriting in general.&nbsp; I need to travel and work on my portfolio.&nbsp; In random news I got a digital camera for Christmas!&nbsp; <a href=""http://good-times.webshots.com/photo/2543070810093643167DodatE"">This</a> is one of the first pictures I took.&nbsp; That's my hot bro and I...I was going for the <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/youthquakemagazine/pics/Shannyn_Sossamon.jpg"">Shannyn Sossamon</a> look.&nbsp; Welp, that is enough blogging for today.&nbsp; I need to do this more, but most times I don't think anyone really cares about what's going on in my LIG."

"event","<p>It's exactly one week until I leave for Italy.&nbsp; I'm freaking out and so excited.&nbsp; I got to catch up with Amber and Meagan today at the Yorktown Pub with really yummy food.&nbsp; Tomorrow I have work=boo the the maximum.&nbsp; But on a brighter note, I went to Barnes and Noble and picked up an awesome address book and journal for my trip, as well as Italian Phrases for Dummies and a Italian/English dictionary.&nbsp; I love books a lot.&nbsp; Thursday my boy and I are going to pick up our mattress!!!&nbsp; It's a queen sized promo plush King's Down.&nbsp; It's so comfortable...I'm going to sleep so much this summer when I get back from my trip.&nbsp; Now all I have to do is buy a headboard and footboard.&nbsp; Fun!&nbsp; It's like I'm a real adult or something with my mattress purchasing and office desk/voicemail/stapler/new computer.&nbsp; I'm old.</p>"

"event","<p>So, work pretty much sucked my face off today.&nbsp; I was there from 8:30am until almost 7pm.&nbsp; My supervisor and I were trying to finish editing this 246 page report about some scientific bowl of crap.&nbsp; And the people on the team who were compiling the report were shooting off emails like mad about addendums and sections to drop in.&nbsp; Bah, I wanted to die.&nbsp; It's like they expect me to be as good as my supervisor when I've only worked there three days.&nbsp; Plus everytime I go to the ""break room"" or go to the potty, I have to walk past this HUGE poster of Dubya cheesin' it up.&nbsp; I'm totally working for THE MAN.&nbsp; And the worst man to work for, at that.&nbsp; But my day got a ton better when I came home to a $275 check.&nbsp; People, PLEASE go to the website for your state treasury.&nbsp; Just Google it.&nbsp; Then, find a way to search <a href=""https://www.trs.virginia.gov/propertysearchdotnet/Default.aspx"">unclaimed property.</a>&nbsp; It's totally not a scam...it worked for me and my ma saw it on 20/20.&nbsp; Search for your last name and it will tell you if you have money owed to you from somewhere and it will tell you what to do to process your claim.&nbsp; My two claims were from a hospital and my old college.&nbsp; Apparently if you overpay, or if&nbsp;a place gives you a refund and you don't know about it, there is a way to get your money.&nbsp; It's insane.&nbsp; And that hefty check made my day.&nbsp; Then I went to my boo's place to have dinner.&nbsp; He took me to Cheddars for a <a href=""http://community.webshots.com/photo/186417716/1200234095055011331askcLf"">COOKIE MONSTER</a>.&nbsp; Greatest thing ever.&nbsp; Then I dragged him to K-Mart, where I made some last minute shopping stops before Italy!&nbsp; I'm so excited.&nbsp; Exactly two weeks until I'm on a plane.&nbsp; That's enough rambling for today, hope you get free money.</p>"

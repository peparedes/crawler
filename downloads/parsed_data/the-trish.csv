Brittany is making me sad by not saying that she misses me... oh I see Britt ok....lol.
Well I went to all 3 Lobo expresses so far. Yesterday I went to the 12th and 11th grade ones for Bob. That bitch is leaving me in one year to go to fucking college. Today we went to mine and my schedule is as follows:

World Geography- 0 Period- Maasen (With Bob)
French 1- 1st Period- Stam (I shall call it spam)
Geometry- 2nd Period- Wells (Kaycee's last name was Wells)
English 2 K- 3rd- McHenry (Gockel's lover)
Public Speaking Video Productions- 4th Period- Ferrard (wow...)
World History K- 5th Period- Coffey (Too easy)
Biology- 6th Period- Wallace (I met him today. He was Bob's old 
teacher)

Well that's it all 7 classes. If anyone knows what lunch I have be a doll and tell me. Here I go to be a fucking sohpomore and Bob's a senior. Hey at least I get to go to prom this year....

Really, some gay guy who lived in the trailer next to us is moving in with his boyfriend and my dad talked him into letting us move in.... It's not for sure yet, but it still fucks with my head.. -Anyways- Bob came over today. He rode his bike 10 miles in the heat for 2 hours just to see me for about half an hour. Damn it he's starting to prove to me that he actually loves me.. My mom and dad are starting to treat Bob like he's one of their own.. They worry about him and look out for him and shit. My mom said he could even move in with us when he turns 18 one year from now. I wonder why his bitch mom hates me.. Oh yeah I know... She thinks I'm a junkie just like my parents.. That dike bitch has no right to judge me. It's ok cause I'm training her own son to hate her. Until I move away, I NEVER sleep... Yes, I'm ok... For now.....

This is really a complaining journal for me. Right now Seagul and Dad are in the car. I just sat in a car for an hour waiting for Bob to tell me he can't be with me now. Fuck the world. I'm gonna try to put up a picture. Wait...Someone send me a picture that you would think I'd like. I'm too lazy to look.

It was quite wonderful seeing that bitch in misery. Then we went to willowbrook so my dad could steal my mom shoes. Then I ate at Chipotle. Which was lovely. Ok that's it for now. I'll see if I can write back when I'm doing all of my homework over the weekend. Pie-oot!

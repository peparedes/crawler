"event","...But i really, truly enjoy finals week, and am genuinely excited that is is here. 

I think of it like this. it will take me approximately 3 hours of studying for each test, of which i have 4. thats 12 hours of studying

Today is Friday, my last final is on Wednesday...which gives me a little more than 144 hours total. Minus 45 hours of sleep time, and the 12 hours of studying time, and 8 hours max of actual test taking. The remainder is 80 hours.

Thats 80 whole hours that i can spend reading, juggling, zoning out, surfing the web, thinking about christmas, crocheting, knitting, (when my room mate leaves) being in the nudie pants, racking up work hours, if i can work finals week, etc etc...how great is that.

and the studying time itself is kind of enjoyable. teachers are very clear cut about what they want you to know, the library is open extended hours, everywhere is peaceful and quiet. 

and then, when all of that is done, i get to go home for christmas. 

theres my story"

"event","So, I went to the gym the other night, which is great. It's like zoning out and listening to music for a half an hour, only on an exercise bike. Anyway, i made this mix that I really like alot. Its only 15 songs, but they're songs that I really like right now, so I figured I would share

1)Plain Jane by the Void Union. Gawd I love them <3
2)Runs in the Family by Amanda Palmer. Her new solo album is really good. Ive been enjoying it
3)Always Something in my Blind spot-Vic Ruggiero. Cutest voice everrrrr!
4)Joy by Against Me!
5)Waiting for the Bus by the Violent Femmes. Kathryn played it last week, and it's been in my head since XD
6)50 Cardinal by the Pinstripes. I really like these guys alot. everyone go check them out right now!!!
7)Friend of Mine by Two and a Half White Guys.
8)Don't You Want a Man by the Slackers. They played it live.
9)Corner Stone by the Have Nots
10)78 RPM by the Stiff Little Fingers
11)Riot Squad by Cocksparrer
12)As I Rise by the Decemberists
13)Classics of Love by Common Rider. Which comes with a comic http://www.mitchclem.com/nothingnice/124/
14)Bad Fish, by Sublime and...
15)Fatty Boom Boom by Westbound Train

Also I am going to a few shows that I am excited about
1)Dropkick Murphys are playing on my campus in early November
2)World Inferno Friendship Society is playing in Portland, also in early November. Matt said he would give me a ride :))) which is awesome, and the Swaggerin Growlers are introing, which will be cool. and crystal from my american government class said she would come too. 
3)If I can get down for it, I'll be at the Big D Halloween show...have nots and void union are introing...but it's kinda a hassle, so maybe not and...
4)The Throwdown!!! I'm an so ready to drop $150 on those tickets. It took alot of mental prep, but I think I can do it now.

some other music-y things
1)the new Welch Boys album is out...i should try to get that
2)apparently that untitled track by Sasquatch and the Sickabillies, the understand your man one, is a johnny cash cover. which I never knew...until recently, when I searched my itunes library for it, and then BOOM! there it was. just like that

Thats it for the good music side. On the bad music side, this kid down the hall from me thinks he is a musician. and he is proceeding to play covers of terrible bands. Im talking like...Hoobastank, Counting Crows, Creed bad. Plus he really cant singer at all...even a little. also on the bad music side, that fucking marching band is warming up again...right out side my window...I hope your freezing you asses off fuckers!

on the life side, this is the first day in a long time that I've been done completely for the day at like 1:30, its a great feeling, I seriously have nothing else to do for the day, and I'm loving it. I just finished my third and final test of the week. I think I kicked it right in its ass...which is good, cause I didn't do so hot on the last one.

I went rock climbing last night with Justine and some other guy who I met on the MOC cabin work trip whose name I don't remember...mark maybe? Aanyway, I met this kid named Collin...who is in my bio class. And a few other people whose names I don't remember. It was intense, seriously, my arms and back hurt so much today. I just bouldered, no belaying, and I didn't really do all that much, cause it was my first time. From what I hear belaying is easier and I fooled around at the bottom of the belaying wall for a bit, but I didn't go up. it was alot of fun, I would really like to start going regularly. 

That's it really...last week I read an entire web comic in like...2 days...I felt pathetic afterward, but it was kinda a short one.

I got a phone over fall break. My first real grown up phone. I'm on a plan and everything, and I pay a bill once a month. And its red and cute and its a camera phone, which is freaking awesome.

and uuhhhh...yeah....I guess thats it"

"event","I had a really busy day today. I had classes from 9:30 till 12:15, and then I got a quick lunch, picked up a key for the herbarium so I can start working there next week. How awesome is that, I fucking love trees. and then I went to see my employer there, to look at the facility, and get an idea of what I would be doing. It's basically the basement of a building filled with storage units filled with preserved plant specimens. anyway, I got out of there at 2:30, and then went over to the Maine outing club offers meeting. Got my weekly officer like assignments, wrote a check, and got the paper work I needed from the office. I was gonna try to finish it there, and just hand it in, but I was really scattered, so I took it back to my dorm room, and stared at it there. It was an additional funding form. After that I had a quick dinner with my room mate Brit, and then went with her and her cousin to do some consolation shopping.

She broke up with her boyfriend...they were together for over a year. she's sad, and its kinda weird for me, cause were not really close friends yet. We've known each other for a while, but I still wouldn't call us close friends, so I'm not sure if I should like...hug her, or what to say some of the time.

Anyway, shopping was fun. We went to marshals, and Brit got a super cute gray plaid retro looking dress, she tried on a pencil skirt too, but didn't like it. Then we went to journeys so she could look at shoes. She got some high top red chucks, and I saw some really cool purple chucks that I liked, but of course they didn't come in my size. Thats life for you. Then we went to Claire's, because I'm kinda a nerd...What can I say, I just really like that store. I got some earrings, for my ever growing collection. I also got my lobes pierced. The next few months are basically gonna consist of me having to clean ear piercings all the time. Cause I kinda have wanted alot of them for a long time, and now I'm just gonna do it. Anyway, I think we went to a few more places too, but I don't remember.

Tomorrow is my all day field trip to Baxter state park. We leave at 4 AM and return at 10 PM. When they say all day field trip, they mean all day field trip. Anyway, I went grocery shopping for it tonight. I got bagels, so I don't have to poo in the woods, and turkey to make a sandwich for lunch, odwalla bars, yogurt for breakfast, rice cakes...some other stuff too I think, but I can't remember. We're climbing Katahdin, which is the highest mountain in Maine, to study mountain ecology. I kinda did the same thing as a sophomore in high school, only with Lafayette, which is about 1000 vertical feet smaller. Ok...I have packing to do and laundry to finish up."

And the sheer length made me giggle, so I'm gonna post it here, along with an estimate of the time it will take<br /><br /><strike>1) Complete OSHA annual training for job. should take 45 minutes or so<br />2) Gather OSHA certification packet and work study stuff and bring to Chris, also for job, shouldn't take more than a half an hour, just a quick walk around the corner.<br />3) Bring said paperwork to office of student employment, with void check to set up direct deposit. also just a short walk</strike><br />4) Bring Maine Outing Club Checks to University Credit Union to deposit, and get a balance inquiry for the account. longest walk EVER. should be about a half an hour total though<br />5) Go over Bio tree specimens for lab practical tomorrow. 1/2 hour to 45 min.<br />6) Read Ch. 3 of American government text. an hour or so.<br />6) read intro, ch 1, ch 2, ch 3, ch 5 and ch 16 of debating democracy book...I got a little behind. ooopala...should take an hour and a half or so<br />7) print out the chem overheads for ch 2...like 30 seconds<br />8) put the cation ions chemical symbol and name onto Q cards. 15 minutes or so<br />9) do the Chem example problem from the overheads...5 minutes<br />10) read ch 1 in chem book. Once again, I got behind, but it shouldn't take me more than a half an hour, its a really short chapter<br />11) also read section 2.2 in chem book...15 minutes maybe?<br />12) do all the section review questions and the chapter review questions for ch 1. an hour ish?<br />13) figure out if I need to do any child development reading, or if i am all caught up. this teacher fails at sticking to the sylabus. we should be on ch. 3 and we just finished ch. 1, so in theory, I should be all caught up, but we'll see<br />14) read ch. 5-7 in bio wessels book. 1.5 hours<br />15) read ch. 2 of bio davis book. why cant he just use one text book? 30 min.<br />16) find a ride to the common grounds fair<br /><br />Ok...now to get to work. GO!!!<br /><br />after i posted this i thought of more. <br />17) Main outing club meeting at 4:15 to request trip funding<br />18) MOC meeting at 7:30. Oi."

"event","I just laid all the stuff out on my bed for the Greylock trip and I cant wait...I'm so excited. Emily and I wend to dicks yesterday, and she got a tent, and I got some wool socks for the hike. Then we went grocery shopping...It's a little unnerving to think that the three bags of groceries we got will feed three people for four days, but its all like...stuff thats mega packed with calories...like peanut butter, and tuna, and rice etc. plus there still some stuff I'll steal from either my mom or my dad before I go...There was just no sense in buying oatmeal when there are like 3 boxes at each house XD 

and I got stuff to make gorp...I mixed it up this morning, and its full of delicious, there isn't even anything I need to pick around. I put peanuts, cashews, window pretzels, m&m's, chocolate covered raisins, banana chips, and dried papaya in it...yum yum yum. 

taking the DJ test today (finally) and then going to work. and then back to Hamilton...I was gonna bike but the rain is messing up all my plans...even if it stops the roads will still be wet :( which is lame...ok...this is me...getting on a train...GO!!!"

"event","I haven't updated in a bit, but the last few days have been really fun, so I figured I would write them down.

I got back from wild fire last Monday, which was awesome. Everyone was super friendly and I learned a super lot of cool stuff. I spun fire poi and I liked it alot, so I started to buy hardware to make my own set. I won't be able to get Kevlar for a while, and I cant find the right kind of chain anywhere, so it might be a while, but it will be fun to pick away at. And while I was there I found out about a bunch of groups that meet weekly in the area. I haven't gotten a chance to check them out yet, but I definitely want to.

Before that was camping with Adriane, Emily and Kathryn. That was alot of fun. We went to River Otter State Part in Baldwinville mass. It was a nice little spot, and really empty. That was forever ago, so I don't remember a bunch of it.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday were work days...Mmm work, unexciting etc etc...

Except on Tuesday Kathryn and I went to the learn how to be a DJ thing for ze radio show, which is wicked exciting, and I cant even wait. And then that night we watched Pee Wee's Big Adventure, in hopes of coming up with a cool name for our radio show. I think we're gonna do it again with other movies too.  

My dad left to go on vacation on Thursday, and I watched the house for them. That was kinda fun. I like having the house to myself. Well, except for the dishes. Friday I biked to Salem to go see a jazz band with Kathryn. I got a flat tire when I was almost home...My uncle patched it up for me, but then the brake cable was tightened, so my pads were pressing up against my tire, making it really hard to go. Of course, I didn't realize till I was half way up canal street on my way to Kathryn's house, so I ended up having to go back later that night. then we went to the show, which ended up being 21+, so we just sat in the hall and listened for a bit, which was actually kind of nice.

later that night Kathryn came back to my Hamilton house with me, and ended up spending the weekend there. Emily came by too for a little bit. We played cards, talked, played tennis, visited my grandma, cause all my tennis balls are at her house, and we needed some. My aunt and uncle were there too, cause the cancer walk was on Sunday. I wasn't able to make it there :( 

Sunday Kathryn and I headed back to Salem...We trained, which was good, cause my tire it flat again...I'm gonna have to use my next check to have it looked at :( instead of doing fun stuff with it. I'm definitely gonna need a new inner tube, and if I was smart I would have a tune up done while it was there, but I probably won't cause I'm cheap. 

anyhow, after that I trained up to newburyport to have birthday dinner with Adriane, Emily, Meredith, Traveling Buddy and Amy, which was super fun and way delicious...Mmm steak. we were gonna tent in Merediths back yard, but it was pouring, so we were like ""Adriane's living room!"" but her mom was being dumb, so it ended up being Emily's living room. we played apples to apples and it ended up being a way fun game. Meredith was being all ridiculous, and tired, and so was Emily, and it was like one huge giggle fest.

Then this morning we all woke up super early to go meet the ES class at the Lawrence damn, cause they're all on the river trip. It was good to see Mr. Saulnier again, and Mrs McMillan was there too. and Mr. king, but I didn't really talk to him a whole bunch. I was hoping Mr. Vercellone would be there too, but apparently he had to leave to go to a conference. They had wicked shitty weather for the last two days boo!

But seeing them doing the river trip made us want to do a river trip, which would would be wicked cool and I really want to do it. 

After that we decided it was a good idea to go to the beach, even though its miserable out. we caught a small break in the weather and tried to body surf, but failed miserably...the waves were big, but it was high tide so they were breaking really close to the shore...I got sand burn like woah...and the water was freezing...then junk food and apples to apples at Adriane's...and then home...and now I'm pretty close to sleep...

Thant all"

"event","I'm back at school, for about two week actually. Classes are going good, Bio is essentially the same as last term, but with new material, Calc is slightly easier then I expected, as helped by a really good teacher, who is really silly, Soil science is at 8:00 am, enough said, and public communications is about as yucky as it gets. Lab TA's are hit or miss as always. Soil guy is good, and possibly Canadian, and Bio guy is foreign and diffecult to understand.

I like that I have all new classes, cause now I dont feel so overwhelmed and behind, and I'm actually motivated to do well this semister. Not that I didn't do well last semister, I just did that with minimal effort and without actually taking in information.

Poi started up, thats going good. Still not many members, but it's good to be learning new stuff again. I can do the low split windmill...which I think is actually called a watermill, and I'm working on the buzzsaw fountain. Picking up the devil sticks and juggling a little too. Frisbee stared as well, but its the nights before my 8:00 AM class, and it's late, like from 9-11, so I don't think I'm gonna be super commited to it.

I've been really retarded about sleeping lately. Once I get past like 12 on nights before the 8 am class, I become convinced that I won't be able to wake up for it the next day, so I just don't go to bed...this concept isn't with out reason, I've slept through it once, and its really hard to stay awake for when i do manage to make it. but I end up going from like 0 sleep to 12 hours of sleep, to 4 hours and stupit stuff like that...its really annoying. And because I'm sleeping wierd, I'm like...eating meals at 3 AM. But the class is like crazy important prerequisite to everything, and I really like it too, so I dont want to drop it. 

Just got a bunch of new music from various sources...some from Kathryn and Emily and I bought two Bim Skala Bim CD's, the Raging Teens, and a Ruder Than You CD...I'm still waiting on the last too, and I'm really excited for the Raging Teens. Also finally got into that Swinging Utters CD, been trying to do that for months, but i always just let it play without actually listening, I like it though...just trying to plow my way through the new stuff, cause there is way too much in my library that I dont know.

Yep...That's pretty much my life...School, skill toys and music...Can't wait for the darkbuster show. Bummed about all the shows I'm missing ETC ETC...

My mom is coming up to visit in a few weeks, I'm not sure what I think of that...she's bringing my sisters for family weekend. At the least I'll get an off campus meal out of her, which is always appreciated....Man, I can't tell if im hungry or if my body is mad at me for not sleeping. Now I'm just dragging this out cause I don't want to finish my Bio lab. I'm gonna suck it up and get back to that."

"event","Tonight was the 3rd night of the bosstones home town throw down and I showed up at the middle east intending on seeing the Allstonians, who were playing upstairs, while the Bosstones played downstaires. So sense we were there we figured we might as well try to get tickets to the bosstones, only I'm the person who blatently insults people trying to buy tickets from people at the door, so I couldn't bring myself to do it.

So we were just standin around, waiting for a scalper to walk by, or the show to start, and just as Emily exclamed ""Why arn't people trying to sell me tickets?"" this guy walks up and asks if we need tickets. Ferthermore, he was not a scalper, but informed us that they were releasing 35 more tickets at the door at the sale price of $25...It was awesome.

While we were waiting in line, we were talking to this guy who had flown from california to see the show with out actually having tickets and he was all happified. And there were totally some people inside speeking german.

The show totally booted its way into the position of my favorite show ever. They played where did you go and royal oil and someday I suppose and dont worry desmond dekker and thats all I can think of right now, and I dont feel like formatting it correctly at all. And the circle pit was like perfect. Alot of the croud was older, so there were only like 20-30 people actually dancing, and the ones that were really annoying wernt even that bad at all. And there was a good mix of actual dancing and moshing. And kathryn and emily totally put huge gauges in this guys back, which made me giggle alot. 

then when it was done we went to the middle east upstairs...I think...I have no clue how the set up workes...but we went to the bar...and I saw this guy i knew from a long time ago who is apparently dating ben carr's sister...which made me giggle. Anyway, Kathryn went to the bathroom while we had our parking ticket stamped for a discount, and she came back saying that she heard ska and thought that the allstonians were still playing so we went to check them out and they were awesome...we caught the last two or three songs, and they played come down by the skatelites and allston beat, which was exciting, and a perfect ending to the awesome show that was the bosstones.

thats all i can think to say, and my hair is still dripping with sweat. so i really need to go shower...hence the lack of spell checking or capitoling, i really just want to be clean...im so glad i get to do this for 3 more consecutive nights!"

"event","the begining of the weekend was fun, friday me, nick, britt, mell, and lauren drove to portland, cause mell and britt live there, and big d was playing. me and britt and lauren were gonna go to the show, but lauren ditched us for chilli that owens(mells boy friend) mom was making.

the show was actually much better then i expected...i think it may have been a combination of the fact that i havnt been to a show in a long time and that emily, adriane and nick met us there...it was great to see them again. i danced a wicked lot and now every part of my body hurts alot...my calves, thighs, back, and between my sholder blades are all killing me...like everytime i move.

i crashed at brits house and the next day we explored portland a little...there are some really neat little shops. i was really good about hanging onto my money, until she brought us into this little cd store and i found a live stiff little fingers album for 10 bucks and the departed used for 10 as well. so i grabbed those.

now im back at campus, after a 2 hour drive, which i slept through most of. i have a fucking geology field trip tommorow for which i need to be out the door at 7:30...the time i usually wake up. we dont get back till 5 which im freaking out about cause i have a bio prelim, an igneous rock lab practical, my pre calc mid term and the second draft of a paper i didnt do so well on the forst draft due...all of which are monday and tuesday...bleck...i could really use the extra study time, but i figure i can get a decent amount done on the bus ride...while i listen to my new stiff little fingers cd"

i got a pocket bible today...people were everywhere handing the out. i think im gonnna use it at random times...just whip it out an be like ""baby jesus says...(insert randomly selected quote here)"" or at the very least , chuck it at people while screaming ""the power of christ compells you"". its green.

having a knitting circle tonight with a few friends...went through and organized all my yarn last night...i wanna make a baby blanket for my second cousin baby. hoping to do it with yarn i have so i dont have to buy new stuff.

"event","went to the common grounds fair yesterday. it was by no streach of the imagination as good as topsfield, but it was pretty cool. there were hippies everywhere. no lie, i saw like at least 50 people with dreads, and some of them were like 2 years old.

i stayed in merediths dorm friday night and i really like her college. she has a good group of friends and i liked hangin out with them. they made me giggle.

anywho, i did some devil sticking and i really liked it. i only had them for like an hour or so, but if i had my own set i think i could get good really fast, it goes quicker then juggling.

meredith and i were juggling/devil sticking at the fair and it was fun. this little kid gave me a doller too, that was exciting.

adriane and emily met us at the fair grounds and we hung out there for a while, then me and adriane and emily drove back up here to spend the night at my dorm. we played uno for three hours....it was only one game. emily won.

now im really behind on homework, and i dont really want to do it....but i will anyway"

"event","last week or so

senior es cookout, where mr saulnier gave us all pocket knives and we threw him in the pool. also played a fun game of marco polo.

spent a few days in maine with adriane and emily, fished, swam, canoed, ate good food etc...

saw the street dogs at the axis, awesome show. and the tossers kicked ass, i really liked them alot

went to ghettysburg for the reenactment, traveling sucked, but i had a blast down there. there was a dance, and it was wicked fun, they just did the virginia reel and the gothic arches over and over, and a lot of waltzing, which i could never quite master. i got the polka pretty quick though, suprisingly it was really fun.

i got sick down there and ive had a cough for a few days, no fun but there is always a family member who will throw leftover prescription drugs at you.

going to see reel big fish, less than jake, streetlight manifesto, and against all authority tonight, that should be fun. adriane, meredith, kathryn and emily are going too. hopefully i dont feel too yucky."

"event","i wicked hardcord dont even a little bit want to go to college right now and its the shittiest feeling in the whole entire universe. i was hoping the orientation would get me excited for it again, but it had the opposite effect.

i think the main reason that i dont like it is that i wasnt even allowed to consider the alternative. between my mom and grandmother and a little bit my dad, i just wasnt allowed not to, and that made it feel like i was doing it on my own, just for me, its like im just doing it to appease all of them.

and at the same time, my mom hasnt even looked at a financial aid form past fafsa, and it was like pulling teeth to get her to do that. she doesnt do much to help untill she sees me having a freak out and then shes all like ""well tell me what you need me to do"" and im all like ""go figure it out yourself, cause i have no fucking idea, its not like ive ever done this before"" only i never really say that cause in all honesty, i can talk to my mother.

and dont get me started on the math placement exam, i just spent a fucking hour and a half trying to log in to or activate the account i use to do that, and just so they can tell me that i suck at math, which im not even at fault for, its just that the aggies math program is equivelant to a preschool coloring in the lines lesson. 

and another thing, umaine orono has like 5 different soft wares/email accounts/online communication methods all of which need to be activated with a seperate username/password/activaction code. do they really expect people to have the motivation to figure that out, i just spent an hour and a half on just one of them and only cause i had to, let alone 5 just for shits and giggles.

and that stupid paper that im supposed to return filled out with information i dont even know...lost...just my luck. which sucks cause all my other college papers are in one convient, organized, central location, only the one i need is missing. and of course, if it got left out in this house, it got thrown away, cause thats the way things work in my house.

and just when i finished spending four years establishing and maintaining friendships, i get all that ripped away and thrown into a completly new situation where i know no one except the girl i met at orientation, who is the reason people say ska is dead and i would avoid like the plague if i ever saw at a show and yet, im stuck clinging to her until i find something better. and i have no except me to blame for this, which makes it even worse.

jeesus christ its like high school never ended, only now, im paying $28,000 a year to deal with the same shit

if anyone even consideres leaving me a sympathetic ""life gets better, hang in there"" comment, just shoot yourself now and save me the trouble.

one more thing. the person who invented dorm rooms needs to be subjected to slow and painfill torture for 18 hours and then shot in the head execution style cause those are the stupidest wastes of space on the planet. lets stick all these kids in one building with one bathroom per floor, shitty showers and no kitchen. and on top of that, were gonna give them four pages of rules and regulations they need to follow. pure genious right there.

did i mention that they just stick random people together unless you request a roommate. dont most colleges have you at least fill out a survey stating your likes, dislikes, study habits, sleeping patterns etc. and pair you based on that. on top of that, the college i choose makes you jump through hoops to change your roomate, instead, they insist on trying to work it out first. thats gonna be the highlight of my life.

and meal plans, they suck too. just what i want, four more years of shitty cafeteria food prepared for the masses. 

i think im starting to feel a little better"

"event","graduation was fun. the speekers didnt suck as bad as i expected and my dad gave me $500, which is always a plus. then we went out to eat with my mom and sisters, grandparents and dad and sarah. it was fun, and nice too see the all together. i got a $25 congradulatory steak. it was yummy. 

i slept at home that night and trained to emilys the next day to go to corinnes graduation party. that was fun. chelsie, colleen, nick, kathy, traveling buddy and a bunch of corinnes sisters friends were there. we played badmitten and volly ball, and ate sushi and later player glow capture the flag after dark. corinne got a wii, which she was rather excited about.

the next day was merediths graduation party and that was the best ever. nate, amy, kaylee, meredith, adriane, emily were there, and there was a chocolate fountian, and another volly ball net, frizbie and fun. we altered the rules of volly ball to include the necicity of noise making when you hit the ball. plus it could hit the ground for as long as ten seconds before the other team got a point. it was rather silly. eventually we had a giant contueous wrestling match with nate, amy, kaylee, meredith, adriane, emily and i that only ended when amy got a bloody nose. it was really fun, and i was a little sore after.

the following day was adrianes graduation party. there were less teenagers at that one. meredith and nate were there in the morning, but the left and it was only me and emily and corinne, and she left shortly after. we played more volly ball(how much can you play that game in one weekend) and swam for a bit. nick(adrianes friend) showed up a little later and the four of us and adrianes sister went to salisbury beach to play in the arcades for a while.

we went back to adrianes house after that and the four of us hung out on this tiny bench in adrianes back yard. we came really close to sleeping out there, but we ended up eventually getting up and going home.

it was a fun weekend. i really like hanging out with friends and it makes me sad that a few of them i might never see again. other than that, the whole schools over thing hasnt really hit me yet. im sure i will be freaking out when it does though."

everyone looked really nice, i was suprised there wern't more skanky half naked girls

i went to merediths after with adriane, emily, meredith, nate, kristen and her date and nick wh works with adriane. he seemed cool, and he put up with the three of us singing in the car the whole way to and from prom. 

we had a fire and toasted marshmellows etc and everyone but kristen and her date slept in the tent. i didnt go to bed till 3 and i woke up at 8. plus i didnt sleep well, so i was wicked tired

meredith had a horse show the next day so she left early, and then we all went our seperate ways. i had adriane drop me off at chelsies house where corinne, t.b, megan, nick, amanda, colleen, chelsie and nicole had spent the night and we played frizbie and badmitten and a few games of capture the flag. that was really fun, especially cause i won both games.

after that i nick gave t.b and megan a ride to the school and me a ride to the hamilton wenham train station. thats where he lives and he wouldnt have been able to get home from the newburyport train station, so i just had him bring me there. man he has the worst sense of dirrection

"event","So, today was wicked fun. i took the ap this morning...mmm....nothing like 3 hours of standardized testing to start your day off right. but after that we got dismised early, so we left school around 12. we went to lynch park hoping it was low tide so we could catch crabs, but no sutch luck, so we sent the minnow trap and went to eat at bill and bobs.

after that we got it in our heads that we needed a crab trap, so we rushed to a bait shop, then to a convience store where we got hot dogs and sardines for bait. then we went to the willows to catch crabs, but the pier was closed down cause of that big storm, so while we were there we got icecream and tried to catch pigeons and squirrels and such(i got one!). 

when we got bored of that we got our minnow trap back and we went to the pier on the beverly side of the beverly salem bridge. we spent like 3 hours catching, releasing and racing crabs. we also tried for minnows, but didnt get any. there were starfish though, those are fun. and muscles, which we started using for bait. and there were jelly fish, it was really fun.

after that we grabed marshmellows, chocolate and rootbeer and came to my house to light stuff on fire. my mom allready had one going so we sat around and roasted marshmellows. my uncle and his wife and her kid were there, cause they moved in down stairs, so we got a game of baseball going, the three kids and me, adriane and emily. it was really fun.

then after the kids went to bed, we went through a bottle and a half of the flamable gell you use to start fires. we were just writing out names and playing tick tack toe and stuff. and we went through a canister of fire salt that turns it pretty colors. it was a good time."

"event","sooo...jeff over dosed on heroin in my bathroom on friday...it was just about the scariest thing ive ever experienced in my whole life. i really thought he was dead, his face was blue and for a while he wasnt breathing. my mom had started cpr and then realized that youre supposed to call for help first.

thats when i came down stairs and my mom threw the phone at me and told me to call an ambulence. my mom had him relativly stable when the emts showed up. if it wasnt such a stupid situation the emts would have been mildly entertaining. instead they were just annoying. they were making jokes and dodging vomit, that sort of stuff. they wrapped him in a sheet and carried him down the staris on a chair and he spent the night in the hospital

what gets to me the most is that i was sitting on the couch like twenty feet away when it happened. in fact i was waiting for him to get out of the bathroom so i could get my pjs.he was detoxing from the prescription drugs and i thought he was feeling sick so i left him alone and got a new pair from upstaires.

my sisters were in their bedrooms which are right next to the bathroom. they didnt wake up, which is a miracle, but the officers had to report it to dss, so now we have to deal with them conducting an investigation. mmm...fun

my mom had tried to throw him out twice in the previous 2 days and he came back both times. once he just ignored her and once i think he was to high to remember he got kicked out. my sisters were both home for the holiday and my mom didnt want to let them see them fight espcially in case it got physical, so she just let him stay instead of confronting him. i dont blame her at all, it is a diffecult situation and she handled it as well as can be expected i guess.

plus i think she felt guilty cause when brownie was going through the same thing she pushed him away and it ended poorly. i think she thought that if she didnt give up on him it would turn out differently. i wasnt really home enough in the past couple of weeks to feel like i saw enough to form an opinion, so i kinda just stood behind whatever my mom did figuring that she needed the support.

i was kinda shook up for a couple of days. i slept im my moms bed that night, balled my eyes out, and i still freak out every time i hear a wierd noise or a car slows in front of my house. not to mention the horrible mental images i get every time i go to the bathroom.

sunday morning, the next day, my mom called the fire deptartment, and had them unlock his truck, cause the keys were locked in it. then she was gonna fill it with all his shit and drive it to his mothers house, only while she and jen were upstairs packing, he came and took his truck. they loaded it all in jens truck and my mom was gonna drop me off at wallgreen while she went to the police to get a restraining order, only he was in his truck in the walgrees parking lot passed out.

we went to the police and told them, and found out that the situation doesnt qualify for a restraining order. the cops went and found him, and he said he wanted to go to the hosptal. once again, he was discharged the following day. i think that because he was a junky before for so long he knew what to say that would keep him out of jail.

so yeah...thats my life right now. on the bright side i can be assured he wont come back."

"event","so my mom just told me a bunch of stuff about whats been going on with jeff and i need a place to put it.

apparently, the meds he is on is for liver pain caused by the hep c. about 9 months ago, my mom had a pinched nerve in her sholder, so jeff gave her some of said meds, which in turn made him run out early. she thinks this is when he started supplimenting with street drugs.

he went to the doctor who said that the meds are easy to build up a tolerence to, so its important to not increase the dossage, but rather take it more times, but in smaller doses. this he basically didnt know throught the 2 years he was on the drugs, and never had a problem refilling his prescription. and if he did, we're right down the street from rainbow terrace and the point.

he is now no longer on the meds, because his doctor thinks that he isnt actually having liver pains, as there is no nerve endings in the liver. the only place pain can come from is inflamation, which he shows no signs of. he is now detoxing from the meds and street drugs to go to another doctor to find out if it is actually gastro intestinal crap. he needs to be clean for two weeks to do that and he has 4 days so far.

hes also had several reasons for manic depression, including loosing his license, not being to get a steady job because of his record, and studying to pass a lpn test(uber hard no one passes thing), which he did and couldnt do anything with because of his cory.and that whole dead dad thing...and his mom is a bitch.

im kinda mad about the whole prescription drug doctor thing, cause i had to watch the same thing happen to brownie. the first thing he said when they were talking about putting him on oxycotton was he was a recovering drug addict, and they needed to be carefull, which was completly ignored and he never had a problem getting more legal heroin. 

in a sense im kinda mad at my mom for doing this, but i figure that he really wants to clean up his act, and thats the difference between him and brownie. you can tell he really wants to, he just has alot stacked against him and its not an easy thing. and lets face it, he doesnt stand a chance on the streets. he would most likey die between the illness and the drugs, and id rather have my mom fight diffecult battle then feel like she didnt do anything to prevent his death.

he also did alot to help her through a very diffecult part of her life and although this requires a bit more sacrifice, it wouldnt be right to just give up on him.

i just hope it ends soon."

even a four day weekend couldnt save me. its a good thing i couldnt go teach myself how to snowboard with adriane yesterday, cause i would be even more dead. 

stayed after for sea today, mailed out all that crap that desperatly needed to get mailed. all of us are so un motivated and it pisses me off cause im the only one getting anything done.

have to work wensday through friday, so i cant go to untimate frizbie, which sucks, but ill get over it. 

that dress came for that wedding of my uncles in may. im kind of excited for that, cause my uncle is super cool and weddings in my family are always fun.

i think im going to invest in a little pocket calander and use it just for shows, cause its really hard to keep track of them all. 

got a pietasters patch at the dropkick murphys show (for free with a pietasters sticker and welch boys sticker cause the merch guy was uber nice and getting no business cause most dropkick murphys fans know nothing about ska or underground boston punk) and i went to put on my back pack and it threw off my symetry. it was sad cause it took me like 20 minutes of rearanging to finally get it right.

"event","oh man, i just got back from states and i am so freakin tired. lets see here, highlights. 

about 10 hours of sleep total in three nights, placed 2nd individual for ag sales(out of like 25 people, i was wicked proud of myself), and second as a team. emily didnt place and megan and adriane got silver and bronze. T.B got silver for prepared public speaking:( we won parli pro again. emily won the raffle to shove a pie in the face of a chapter officer. she grabbed the can of whipped crean when she was done and went at him with that, and then she tried to give him a mohawk.

we did alot of dancing in the hotel room. and we played alot of uno, and bull shit. we essentially took any and all oppertunities to make complete fools of ourselfs. we were wicked bad at the dance, we were all like, really bad white girl dancing, and when they played rockish typed songs, we did the leg guitar thing, and we moonwalked and stupid stuff like that the whole night. towards the end we got the dj to play the impression that i get, and we skanked, and i was supprised by how many people joined in. there was even this one kid wearing a reel big rish t shirt.

so the whole weekend emily had this fairly attractive young gentleman bringing her food cause she couldnt eat alot of what they had there, and at that one big meal, he brought her out a salad and a dinner plate, and an alternate dessert and every time he came out we were ragging on amily, trying to het to request a foot massage and stupid stuff like that and it was really silly. 

our bus broke down on the way back, and we were all like...two hours later than expected, so we missed the busses and spent an hour playing cards at a rest stop somewhere on 495

i had much more fun then i expected to, and now, i am exhausted and im seriously considering going to bed now."

"event","so last wensday, i spent the night at adrianes house, to work on the states project(only really just play uno) and it was fun. at one point, adriane had to go pick her mom up at the train station, so she left me and emily alone in her room for like a half an hour. 

so adriane has this book shelf in her room with like 200+ romance novels on it and we were looking at it and we decided it would be a good idea to switch them around, cause she anally organizes them. we considered that for a while, and then decided it would be a better idea to put them all in a pile in the middle of her floor. 

so we started on that and decided it would be a better idea to hide them all in various places around her room, so for like 20 minutes, we were running around her room shoving them i drawres, laundry piles, closets, old unused purses, pillowcases etc we even hid them in her bathroom.

so she comes back and walks in, and by this time, emily and i are done and had moved on to using our legs as guitars. our antics prevented her from noticing the bookshelf. so then she sees a book on the floor, walkes in the other dirrection to open the window, and then goes to put the book on the bookshelf. she was looking down for most of the walk and when she was like 7 feet away she looked up and the look on her face was so priceless.

stayed after for ultimate frizbee today and it was alot of fun. i havnt played for a bagillion years, and i like it alot. its a little wierd, cause emily and adriane arnt there and theyre everywhere, but meredith went, and that was cool. however, my ankle paid the price...and my shoes.they each have a 6 inch hole on the side and its right next to a four inch hole and theyre only seperated by a strand.

so i called my grandmother and asked her if i could use her credid card to by a pair of flaiming low top converse online. i really dont like high tops. and while she was at it, i asked her to put the downpayment on that prom dress and ill pay her back when i get my check on friday. thanks again to the bank of grammy.

the more i look at that prom dress the more i like it. and its something that im not gonna just wear once and throw away, which is always nice. emily was saying that she was gonna buy a $35 cocktail dress at a consignment shop and cover it in studs. i cant wait to help, its gonna be fun."

talked to emily about going to georgia over april vacation. she seemed really into it, and we looked at campsites and calculated out how much we would have to spend in gas and food and such. i think it would cost about three hundred a person, which isnt bad. now all we have to do is convince adriane that she wants to go. she makes $500 from working straight through a vacation, so i dont know how willing shes gonna be to give that up"

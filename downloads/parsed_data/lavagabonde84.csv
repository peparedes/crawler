I want a Kindle so badly but feel like its just a hook, to you know, spend more. Once you purchase it then you browse through the books and purchase those. Most of them are 9.99, but with me it wouldn't matter because a thousand masterpieces would be quite literally at my fingertips--I'd end up buying hundreds of books in one ten minute sitting. No, I'm sorry. I wouldn't be sitting, I'd be lying down on my bed. That seems wrong. My poor bank account which already suffers. 


Have been reading the Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath. God damn people who romanticise suicide. Was I one of those people? I hope not, because trying to rent that heavy lovely albatross from the library is to get many concerned stares back from the people behind the desk. What? I;m sorry that Emily Dickinson's journal entries weren't available, and frankly her vernacular is at times a bit out of my reach. Sylvia is just right. There are no great writers who would ever allow their journals to be put on display, except Sylvia. Maybe even she wouldnt have allowed it. But its as good as reading a book of her poetry, her feelings and observations are just as crisp, and&nbsp; her &quot;casual&quot; writing style puts mine to shame. Really, no one writes a diary entry like that anymore. Just typing this out right now&nbsp; makes me ashamed at how dumbed down my inner monologue is, when its transcribed onto the page. All of my generation, really. We dont use punctuation, we dont know what adverbs articles predicates are. The adjectives we use are chosen from one of three, and no one really cares. 

On that note, I'm gonna goes and reads some more o' that aweeesome hyperbole of hers."

"event","What is it with celebrities and fashion lines? Why? Do they want a huge closet where they don't have to pay money to wear cool shit? Do they just wanna make money? I have a hard time swallowing the whole ""creative urge with talent"" bit when it comes to celeb clothing lines simply because it takes years for designers to perfect their craft. Its art. (Sort of like when James Franco had a gallery showing for his paintings, mmm although visual art is more subjective than a pair of pants though. You know a pair of pants are crap when you put them on and the crotch is where the knee is supposed to be. Modern art is more illusive, never really sure if its original or crap) But then again these celebs dont have a hand in the actually crafting of their clothes, they dont even know how to sew! Actual fashion designers spent years in costume design or in classrooms, in front of the sewing machine, behind the desk at the cleaners learning bespoke. I bet Vera Wang and Stella McCartney are slighting puking in their leather booties considering they have to compete with crap like J.Lo's jogging suits or Justin's William Rast. I mean, thats what you get I suppose when you try to make good fashion affordable at H&M or Kohls. 

I dont know why I suddenly decided to write about that. Justin was on Oprah today and I think hes really funny, not a huge fan of his music but a fan of the Elton John duet he did, and he seems like a good entertaining talented musician. Then why the clothing line? Everybody wants to be a mogul I guess."

"event","<br />Ugh. <br />Thats what Cleo says as she walks out of the Astrologists office, glaring into her reflection, longingly. <br />&nbsp;This movie, <strong>Cleo from 5 to 7</strong> by Agnes Vardas, follows a french chanteuse in real time for two hours while she awaits the results of a biopsy. She runs around Paris like a baby doll, happy to be sad, staring into mirrors whenever confronted with the possibily of death or illness.&nbsp; I hate to love and love to hate her, because in the end she gets what she wants. Her illness.<br />Maybe she doesnt want it, but I get the feeling she does. It is more melodrama. Something she is used to. <br />She starts out very weak with the above proclamation, but by the end, she emerges (or is supposed to emerge) stronger. Do I like her more? Eh. Not really. I didnt get that feeling at all. Maybe it was bad acting. <br />&nbsp;Maybe I was just upset to see a woman equate beauty to health. That idea never left my head. It haunted me. Because though this film is shot like a documentary about one woman, but you get the feeling that she is echoing several generations of females who think the same way. Instead of letting that concept blossom, it just lays there. Enter seedy French man who likes to talk about nudity. <br />&nbsp;Lets see...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you like staring at a model's face, then maybe you'll like this film. And sometimes I do like to do that. Sometimes I like to stare, sometimes my eyes are hypnotized by the contours of a woman's cheeks, her ski-slope nose, her chin made of glass. But mostly its when this kind of beauty is paired with confidence and tralala-ishness, that I become a real voyeur, like a child pauper staring into the window of a candy shop. I had those moments in this movie. Like, wow. and...jeez nice apartment. <br />&nbsp;I hope Vardas' intention was to either have a complete joke on us, or ya know, make us think. For me, I wasnt so interested in the fact that Cleo becomes kinder and less selfish as the film progresses, b/c as I said she was still pretty annoying by the end of the movie. The only thing of value I took away from the shabang was how self-involvement can be a cancer, and sometimes it takes the real thing (or another kind of life-changing event) to snap a person out of it. <br /><br /><br />"

I suppose I'm talking about the nature of cinema,&nbsp; but also the way we communicate our feelings and attitudes when it comes to love self identity;&nbsp; in the movie they are the same as reflected in today's modern films (the GOOD ones).&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it wrong to find that comforting? Maybe if I&nbsp;were watching Roger Moore in Octopussy, but I&nbsp;dont think so in this case. Not in this movie. And who does Jack Lemmon remind me of? I&nbsp;know Kevin&nbsp;Spacey always said Lemmon was his hero, but alas poor Kevin hasnt been around in ages.

Will</span></a></div></font><span style=""font-size: larger;""> Thursday, February 26, 2009; Page A19<br /></span>   <p>Put down that cheeseburger and listen up: If food has become what sex was a generation ago -- the intimidatingly intelligent Mary Eberstadt says it has -- then a cheeseburger is akin to adultery, or worse. As eating has become highly charged with moral judgments, sex has become notably less so, and Eberstadt, a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, thinks these trends involving two primal appetites are related. <br />In a Policy Review essay, &quot;<a href=""http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/38245724.html"" target="""">Is Food the New Sex?</a>&quot; -- it has a section titled &quot;Broccoli, pornography, and Kant&quot; -- she notes that for the first time ever, most people in advanced nations &quot;are more or less free to have all the sex and food they want.&quot; One might think, she says, either that food and sex would both be pursued with an ardor heedless of consequences, or that both would be subjected to analogous codes constraining consumption. The opposite has happened -- mindful eating and mindless sex. Imagine, says Eberstadt, a 30-year-old Betty in 1958, and her 30-year-old granddaughter Jennifer today. Betty's kitchen is replete with things -- red meat, dairy products, refined sugars, etc. -- that nutritionists now instruct us to minimize. She serves meat from her freezer, accompanied by this and that from jars. If she serves anything &quot;fresh,&quot; it would be a potato. If she thinks about food, she thinks only about what she enjoys, not what she, and everyone else, ought to eat. <br />Jennifer pays close attention to food, about which she has strong opinions. She eats neither red meat nor endangered fish, buys &quot;organic&quot; meat and produce, fresh fruits and vegetables, and has only ice in her freezer. These choices are, for her, matters of right and wrong. Regarding food, writes Eberstadt, Jennifer exemplifies Immanuel Kant's Categorical Imperative: She acts according to rules she thinks are universally valid and should be universally embraced.</p>  <p>Betty would be baffled by draping moral abstractions over food, a mere matter of personal taste. Regarding sex, however, she had her Categorical Imperative -- the 1950s' encompassing sexual ethic that proscribed almost all sex outside of marriage. Jennifer is a Whole Foods Woman, an apostle of thoroughly thought-out eating. She bristles with judgments -- moral as well as nutritional -- about eating, but she is essentially laissez-faire about sex.</p> <p>In 50 years, Eberstadt writes, for many people &quot;the moral poles of sex and food have been reversed.&quot; Today, there is, concerning food, &quot;a level of metaphysical attentiveness&quot; previously invested in sex; there are more &quot;schismatic differences&quot; about food than about (other) religions.</p> <p>If food is the new sex, Eberstadt asks, &quot;where does that leave sex?&quot; She says it leaves much of sex dumbed-down -- junk sex akin to junk food. It also leaves sexual attitudes poised for a reversal. Since Betty's era, abundant research has demonstrated that diet can have potent effects, beneficial or injurious. Now, says Eberstadt, an empirical record is being assembled about the societal costs of laissez-faire sex.</p> <p>Eberstadt says two generations of &quot;social science replete with studies, surveys and regression analyses galore&quot; have produced clear findings: &quot;The sexual revolution -- meaning the widespread extension of sex outside of marriage and frequently outside commitment of any kind -- has had negative effects on many people, chiefly the most vulnerable; and it has also had clear financial costs to society at large.&quot;</p> <p>In 1965, the <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm"" target="""">Moynihan Report</a> sounded an alarm about 23.6 percent of African American children born out of wedlock. Today the figure for the entire American population is 38.5 percent, and 70.7 percent for African Americans. To that, add AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, and the unquantifiable coarsening of the culture and devaluing of personal intimacy.</p> <p>Today &quot;the all-you-can-eat buffet&quot; is stigmatized and the &quot;sexual smorgasbord&quot; is not. Eberstadt's surmise about a society &quot;puritanical about food, and licentious about sex&quot; is this: &quot;The rules being drawn around food receive some force from the fact that people are uncomfortable with how far the sexual revolution has gone -- and not knowing what to do about it, they turn for increasing consolation to mining morality out of what they eat.&quot;</p> <p>Perhaps. Stigmas are compasses, pointing toward society's sense of its prerequisites for self-protection. Furthermore, as increasing numbers of people are led to a materialist understanding of life -- who say not that &quot;I have a body&quot; but that &quot;I am a body&quot; -- society becomes more obsessive about the body's maintenance. Alas, expiration is written into the leases we have on our bodies, so <i>bon appetit</i>. <br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />It annoys me when old ker-fudgitty men write about women and sex. Like they even have a clue.&nbsp; Particuarly this dude. That aside, its still might be an interesting correlation to put out there...Maybe? I wanted to post the whole thing because I thought it would increase chances of readership, as opposed to a link, if anyone reads my posts, or the Washington&nbsp;Post better yet. Much better yet. <br /><br />I've read a couple of times and am still not persuaded. <br />&nbsp;</p>"

Except I had to watch the second part first and the first part second because well, thats how it works when you watch something illegally.&nbsp; Ironically the movie was sooo incredible and I think it had to do with the order in which I watched it. <br />But it also had to do with director James Grey, who captures NYC so well. Sort of like the anti-Woody Allen. While Allen captures its quirks, Grey captures the melodrama, the accent, the cultural mix, the Brighton&nbsp;Beachiness of it all (whatever its a word to me...) <br />Joaquin was fantastic, his character is so genuine and sincere, but hes also so flipping sexy. You know there are just no dashing &quot;open wounds&quot; walking around NYC like him, but you hold back that slight misgrievance because a)he's compelling b) he's sexy. Did I mention that already, yes i did. <br />Gwyneth was actually great too, possibly the best she's been since oh i donno, Shakespeare in Love. We all love to hate her and her Goop, she is kind of goopy. <br />And Isabella Rosselini as the mom...love her. <br /><br />So check check check. Good good good.

I cant help but be affected by the choices other people in my life make, lots of them are deciding on grad school, pursuing a lifelong dream, or just basically moving forward with their respective&nbsp;lives. I cant be impulsive but I've had my heart set on several things, it just takes such tough skin and perseverence. I know its all fear-based. (Cheesy song, ""I dare you to move, I dare you to lift yourself up off the ground"" plays consistently in my head)&nbsp; 

Sigh. There were alot of reasons why I originally came to DC. I feel like its getting old now, its wearing on me. Sometimes its because of ""him"", because he was the last reason why i said, ""ok, so I'll stay."" And now I am all out of reasons other than the pragmatic logical ones like, ""cant quit a job until you get a new one...what about your health benefits katherine?...."" blah blah. So I've re-vamped my resume, my dad's helping me out, I'm looking into some grad school programs. And, well, We'll see.&nbsp; 
Yes we'll see how the great inter-connected Jungian synchronicity principle works this time. On me, on my family, on friends . We'll see. 


And Josh, when or if you read this--&nbsp;thank you. Just ya know, for&nbsp;just being the best big brother a girl&nbsp;could have. Sometime I hope you'll write a journal entry here about your innermost thoughts, or at least some of them, because the ones that you share with me are so much more frickin' interesting than anything I could write about."

"event","<p>Some&nbsp; days I go to work and its ok. Some days I hide inside the back office when I'm really supposed to be out on the sales floor ensuring proper custumer service. I'm honestly a shy person, friendly. sort of, but groups of people, strangers-- they kind of scare me. Sometimes eye contact is so terrifying my eyes flicker and I have to squint! How did I end up being a mananger at a retail store again? Toto we're not in Kansas anymore.&nbsp;<br /><br />Everything I generally write about on Livejournal usually revolves around the superficial aspects of my life, because its more fun that way. I dont want to write about all the icky personal stuff, but at the same time I feel like I'm lying to myself if I dont. Why cant people just abandon their awful judgements and love one anotha?!<br /><br />One of my favorite poets is Louise Gluck, (pronounced Glick). Alot of critics despise her because they see her as being overly seratonin-level obsessed, doesnt utilize the negative capability, and all about depression and sadness and well, herself. Helloooo, thats what confessional poetry is!&nbsp; Anyway, theres one poem of hers that I really love. It hits at the heart of how I feel about my life, path, self, and also what I know others are going through/have been through. Life is tough. I spent a year in bed deciding whether or not I wanted to continue mine.&nbsp;There's nothing more embarassing to me than having to explain to people&nbsp;what I did during that period of time I was absent from school, didnt pick up my friend's phone calls, terrified my parents,&nbsp;couldnt even&nbsp;muster up the courage to walk into a 7-11. (which is why i say I took an art class and worked at home) But that period is such a part of who I am, and the recovery part of it is, too. Theres no easy way out. One must go through. And there is&nbsp;something so beautiful and cathartic about hitting rockbottom and then coming out on the other side with&nbsp;a different perspective on life.&nbsp;I guess what I mean to say is, when all of those stupid overly cheery people I work with come to me with their judgements, I now know to look at them. And yawn.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the poem.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><br />The Wild Iris</strong><br /><br /><br />At the end of my suffering<br />there was a door.</p><p>Hear me out: that which you call death<br />I remember.</p><p>Overhead, noises, branches of the pine shifting.<br />Then nothing. The weak sun<br />flickered over the dry surface.</p><p>It is terrible to survive<br />as consciousness<br />buried in the dark earth.</p><p>Then it was over: that which you fear, being<br />a soul and unable<br />to speak, ending abruptly, the stiff earth<br />bending a little. And what I took to be<br />birds darting in low shrubs.</p><p>You who do not remember<br />passage from the other world<br />I tell you I could speak again: whatever<br />returns from oblivion returns<br />to find a voice:</p><p>from the center of my life came<br />a great fountain, deep blue<br />shadows on azure sea water.</p><p><br /></p>"

"event","<p>So my attraction to this person at work has been tainted by the fact that he is attracted to me, and every other living breathing female. When I first met him I thought he was gay. Ok, cool with me. As I got to know him I began to appreciate his attention to detail and work ethic which some people mistook for rigidity and strictness. I&nbsp;learned that he actually wasnt gay. &nbsp;I then thought ok, well this guy's a prude. Now that I've been here a month I know that he is in fact a man whore, who often doesnt shower and comes to work dressed in the sex he had last night with some random chick. He loves random chicks. And you know what? That wouldnt bother me if he didnt constantly brag about it. How disgusting. Man, if you get alot of action then there's no need to discuss it! Unless of course, you have some sort of inferiority complex and talking about your stupid sexual exploits boosts your ego. Casanovas have a special place in my heart, simply because they really do love pussy (I'm sorry I had to use the word) and there's nothign that stops them from getting it. I mean, I dont date those dudes but I dont have any issues with their lifestyle. &nbsp;This guy, who in all other aspects is really top notch, tells his co-workers about the girls he ""uses"" with an element of pride in his voice. Dude, whats with you?&nbsp;<br /><br />(ANd furthermore, whats with me? Hes just like my ex-boyfriend. As a matter of fact, his sun and moon are in the same planets as my ex-boyfriend.&nbsp;i need to start focusing on things other than men. Maybe take a yoga class, center my chi. Then I wouldnt feel so bothered, particularly when I hear about everything at work the next day.&nbsp;I could just be like, 'its ok, its all impermenant. So as the birds, scraps of night...blah blah blah....<br /><br /><br /><br />In other news? Hillary is bowing out. I expected it. And Obama definitely has my vote (if McCain somehow steals this election the way Bush did I really am transferring to a store in Canada somewhere No seriously, they have Abercrombies there.)<br /><br />Um, a&nbsp;tornado touched down where one of my&nbsp;friends lives and basically demolished his house. I saw a picture, huge 200 year old trees crashed into his roof and every other level of the house. He's staying in a hotel. Gosh, I dont know what to do. But of all people for this to happen to...poor Robert.&nbsp;He just broke up with his husband too. I hope he;ll be ok.&nbsp;<br /><br />BON IVER is coming to the BLack Cat August 1st!!!! I'm so psyched I already bought my ticket. WIld horses cant drag me away from this event. So excited.... anyone else wants to come let me know!!!&nbsp; (Josh introduced me to the group, such flipping beautiful music)&nbsp;<br /><br />Thats it in La-la land.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","<p>Live journal is all about friendly debate. But it seems the only ones who want to talk about politics within my LJ circle are my brother or Ryan. Props to you.&nbsp; I wish I could find a Hillary supporter out there with more political wisdom and objectivity than I, then I could partake in truly invigorating debate. Dont you think? But where are all the intellectual&nbsp; Hillary Supporters that dont leave a bitter aftertaste after they're done expressing their views? I suspect there are very few of those kinds of people. I have to say, if you come across a bitter Hillary supporter its probably because she's a woman who has grown up fighting the glass ceiling, hates wheatgrass but does the diet anyway to measure up to standards, and is still getting over her adoloscent Ophelia complex. Yes, alot of female Hillary supporters are bitter about the way the election is turning out, and its not because they dont want Obama to win, its because they dont want Hillary to lose. Sometimes I think its men who have the greater&nbsp;luxury of being objective and empassioned over a political candidate, because it's just a tad bit easier for you, boys, however much you complain about your life. And I'm happy that people are rallying together in support of a great guy who is a democrat (thank God) and who holds great promise for our country. For some reason, I want Hillary to win. And it has nothing to do with politics, nada. Its because she's a woman. Simple as that. WRONG as that. I want to see a woman like me as president of the United States. And if/when she loses its going to hurt me, personally hurt me, like we're still not good enough. Another fucking example of how women are just not there yet. And all of the Obama supporters, black, white, hispanic, whatever, will cry tears of joy at Obama's inauguration, particularly every African-American thats had to fight their way towards equality.&nbsp;Lets face it, this election isnt just about politics.&nbsp;Its become personal.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;Its funny. Josh and I talk all the time about debating and how women tend to shy away from it when confronting a well-informed male. When it comes to someone like my brother, who <em>is</em> so well-informed, so intelligent, and just basically so naturally gifted in the realm of verbal artistry theres no way you can win a friendly argument with him!&nbsp; Every time I post something slightly controversial it feels like the first time i decided to raise my hand in AP European history class because I knew all the smart boys were watching, listening, and waiting to completely massacre any idea or tidbit I wanted to put out there. And even if it held no weight, I just wanted to know they heard my voice. Hellooo, I'm here. I'm smart, too. I'm more than a face or a body or a pose. It took alot of courage for me to raise my hand, probably once a quarter term did I do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sink or swim. Sink or swim, thats what it felt like. I can remember the feeling, still. But I give much credit to my mother, who&nbsp;always told me I&nbsp;was brilliant and could do anything I wanted to do, becaus&nbsp;she grew up being told the exact opposite.<br /><br />&nbsp;Regardless of how you feel about Hillary or who you voted for in the primaries, and who you're going to vote for in the general election, Hillary is a brave woman. And misogyny is still out there and kicking, and I believe it's the reason why she's going to lose this one. </p>Thats that. Now I'll go back to being coy and cute. Happy Valentine's Day, everybody. Love thyself. :)"

"event","""The Eskimos had 52 names for snow because it was important to them,"" wrote novelist Margaret Atwood. ""There ought to be as many for love."" Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to coin at least nine of those 52 new names between now and January 1, 2009. Of course that means you will have to discover or create nine alternate states of love that have previously been unnamed. And to do that, you'll have to put aside your habitual expectations and standard definitions of what constitutes love so that you can explore an amazing array of nuances, including varieties you never imagined existed. 

-freewill astrology 


Actually, when I was feeling down and out and kind of bored last summer I painted the words on canvas, dissapointed that in fact it wasnt the word love that existed in 300 versions, but snow. Of course it makes sense, they even have a word for a man who has snow stuck in his beard! I love it. And this horoscope. It couldn't be more right on, at least for me."

"event","<p>So the pats lost. You know I didnt even know the superbowl was today until some of the males in my life reminded me. So, how does one go from not even knowing about an event to being bummed out about the way it eventually went down? It must be those silver helments, I do think the Patriots have the best uniform in the league. or conference. or whichever is correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there's the Brady. Who I'm sincerely not into, though there was a moment&nbsp;that caught my eye. More out of pure humour than anything else, but during some time out he actually walked past his teammates and stood in front of the camera on the field with his hands on his hips and looked out&nbsp;into the distance,&nbsp;and the camera-guy sooo panned around him as if to really emphasize how much he is,&nbsp;as Josh later hysterically called it,&nbsp; the NFL's David.&nbsp; Hahahaha.&nbsp;<br /><br />I havent written much lately on live journal, because there isnt much to say.

I had to block myself from viewing any websites that didnt have to do with either Jesus, Old-Time Music Theory, or the prospect of democratiziation in Iraq for the past few days.

Its so weird to be home. I was grumpy this morning. Its that fear of suburbia thing. I've definitely developed it. It would take two hours in order to get to a real city from here, just interesting to know. But its ok. Good to see the fam. I'm gonna start re-doing my resume, and then job searching of course.

This week, in order to incite a purifying ruckus, we're offering you a challenge from psychologist James Hillman. Please suck the following thoughts into the deepest recesses of your understanding, and enjoy the brainstorms they detonate: ""By accepting the idea that you are the effect of a subtle buffeting between hereditary and societal forces, you reduce yourself to a result. The more your life is accounted for by what already occurred in your chromosomes, by what your parents did or didn't do, and by your early years now long past, the more your biography is the story of a victim."" What I'm trying to tell you, Virgo, is that it's a fine time to rebel against your genetic heritage, your upbringing, and your conditioning. Imagine a life for yourself in which you don't believe that those factors control what you're capable of. ""<br /><br /><br /><br />Imagine <em>that</em>. <br />"

"event","So my friend of friend's liver status has improved, but her kidney's aren't doing well. she has to do dialysis everyday. I'm trying to get ahold of Matt and Patty but they dont seem to want anyone else involved, so I;m just gonna let it be, in the words of Paul McCartney (unless you're a Happiness is a Warm Gun type person then you probably think Lennon wrote most of the Beatles licks)&nbsp;
Anywho, so. My life. Your life. Our lives, intertwining together in this place we call livejournal. How intriguing to me.&nbsp;

Today on the metro ride home, some kid offered his brother a trip to Catalina over the phone. I guess he had a free ticket, his semester was over and decided he wanted to lay low. He was wearing a baseball cap and corduroy jacket, and kept his head down the entire ride. I imagined in my state of fantasy/voyeurism that he's a character out of that show Dirty Sexy Money, though I've yet to see it. (was it cut?) The guy next to him was playing with an arubix cube and I was praying he'd get it right before we arrived at my stop; he came very close, but no cigar.&nbsp;

Hmm, what else? I'm one music theory, one Jesus paper, one Comparative politics test away from graduating. How completely terrifying! I went to the career center and was bombarded with disillusionment. Not really, I'm excited to revise my resume actually. The ""career consultant"" gave me this sheet of verbs to use. So if I were to say I spent an entire summer chatting with the guy next to me in the Purchasing department, what I really did was mediated/coached/ or maybe resolved some of the daily problems that arose in context to um, purchasing orders or some such nonsense, Ehhh,I wouldnt actually say that, I'm tired. Ok, maybe I will. We'll see. HA.&nbsp;

"event","<p>I was told today that my friend Matt's girlfriend is in the hospital with kidney and liver failure, and the chances of her recovering without a liver transplant are slim. Doctors can be wrong sometimes, cant they?&nbsp;<br />She's 22 years old. An Iraqi war Marine veteran, deployed twice, survived twice. I mean, I knew she had some problems to work out (as well all do) and was making some not so ""healthy"" choices with her life, the reason why her liver failed is not so clear at the moment. Well, it is and it isnt.&nbsp;<br />Last time I saw her she cooked dinner for all of us: lemon pasta, chicken cutlets, and a tangerine-infused cake. It was delicious. They had just moved into an apartment together and were slowly getting furniture/decorating the place. I have no idea what to do. Matt hasnt called me. His mother (my mom's best friend) hasnt called me. I feel like I should do something but to be truthful I dont even know what hospital she is in. She was really only an aquaintance but I had hope to forge a friendship with her. I'm praying for her recovery.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>"

"event","<p>So that dude I've been scoping out stopped by the apartment with a nice bottle of pinot grigio the other night.&nbsp;(my favorite kind of wine)&nbsp;Now that I think about it, he showed it to me with a look of pride as if he already knew it was my favorite.&nbsp;(is he spying?) Nah,&nbsp;it was nice, we chatted for two hours or so. Hes a very learned figure. His thesis paper is basically proposing a strategy to set up some sort of safety net/security program/health plan for people living along the Chechnyan/Georgian border. As we all know, things there= not so good. Rabies is actually one of their biggest problems due to the rabid dogs. Yikes.&nbsp; As he told me his stories, I felt the urge to drink more. As I started to lull into a sort of Victor Hugo-esque state of mind (he always encouraged people to ""drink while the cup is full!"") I realized how much we had in common and how little we had in common. Doesnt really matter. I guess I just didnt feel the same chemistry I did when I first sought him out.&nbsp;I was REALLY nervous. Cant help it. (virgos&nbsp;rule the nervous system)&nbsp;Plus, yes, thats right: he has a girlfriend. Though he places his relationship in the ""wreckage"" status, I told him its all good and we've got a friendship going. La de da. <br />There was something sort of creepy about him though, I cant put my finger on it exactly. Its like, he doesnt blink or something. Haven't quite figured it out yet. I did his birth chart. His moon mercury and venus are all in virgo, which makes alot of sense why we initially connected. </p><p>I dont know just keeping my options open really. Its always nice to get to know someone better, and you never know with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My desires change every day. (although if asshole called me at 4am in the morning again I'd probably make the same trip over in my pajamas just to see him)&nbsp;AHHH!&nbsp;<br /><br />_____ Warning: Josh, you may find reading this stuff&nbsp;below uncomfortable from older brother perspective.&nbsp;Just a heads up. I really didnt feel like re-customizing my journals, I'm getting tired but wanted to get all these things off me' chest. ___<br /><br /><br />As far as sexuality goes (yes I'm going there, please fear not, just the ramblings of a quizzical Gemini-Rising) I'm attracted to the human being first and foremost, the physicality comes second. &nbsp;This fact has had a strange effect upon the various people I've expressed it to, depending upon how I preface it. Par exemple: one of my best gal friends took it as a hint that she could hit on me once she decided she wanted to try dating women. AKA: that WASNT pleasant. (I still have a hard time telling people I""M NOT INTERESTED for fear of hurting them. That gets me into sticky situations) Anyway, other people may think I'm some sort of Sinead O'Connor wannabe, saying things like ""I'm 75 percent straight and 25 percent bisexual."" I'm just trying to get to the heart of the matter, who I am, To be honest, I'd prefer a man, but I do feel for women, sometimes feel bad for them. (for me? NEVA) I was raised to be suspiscious and untrusting of the opposite sex, which I feel was a mistake on my parents part, but all is forgiven. All in all, the path to full sexual/ spiritual liberation for me has been and is a very interesting one. I'm only at the beginning.&nbsp;<br /><br />Forget the Ambien just read my livejournals! Sweet dreams Earthlings. </p>"

"event","So , heres a story, thats at the least entertaining to me. Today, in a moment of bravery I decided to post a post-it note with my number on the car of a guy I've been chatting with (scoping out) for the past few weeks. I always knew he drove the blue car that made a special sound when he pressed the unlock button. After I did it I felt very good, and off I went to the bus. When I get back the note is sadly still stuck on the window. Fast forward to nighttime--I go for a cigarette but this time decide to sit near the laundry steps so my landlord doesnt see me and ponder all the ways to throw me out of her kingdom because I'm technically loitering (according to the contract) even though nothing ever gets fixed and no one ever really gets in trouble 'round these parts. (even the people who decide to steal laundry detergent or break into a string of cars and steal GPS systems etc) Anyway, I'm sitting on the steps when out walks this giggly girl who is immediately followed by none other than the annointed messiah of my currently non-existant love life. I'm shocked. Shocked. Shocked. (YOU MUST LOVE ME, SINGS&nbsp;MADONNA AS EVITA)&nbsp;I say hello, he says hello, asks me how I am, blah blah blah (crying inside). He continues walking up the steps, out of my life, and into the WRONG FUCKING CAR. I mean, it made the special sound, but NOT the car I put the post-it note on. I feel like an idiot and immediately run to the other car and rip the note off in a fit of sadness/rage where it leaves an awful mark that even my nails can't remove. Two hours later I go outside again and run into my next door neighbor Evan, whose been consistantly&nbsp;asking me out&nbsp;on dates since the first day I met him. (I'm not tooting my own horn its just a fact and he's very sweet but not my type and he'll find someone nice and sweet and of the appropriate height because to be honest I like guys who are at least three inches taller than me--ok Josh, so There IS one preqreq I have for dating) He tells me that his dog died. The worst news in the world, right? I love my dogs my heart will break when they pass on. So I give him my condolenses, tell him he has nice dimples (shouldnt have done that but thought to throw him a bone no pun intended) and then as he walks onward guess which car he gets into--FUCKING POST-IT NOTE CAR!&nbsp; I dont know if he ever saw it. Maybe not. Maybe he did. Maybe thats why he asked me if I had brought a guy home the other night because the note clearly addresses someone other than him.&nbsp;

I feel really bad and I hope he didnt see the note + i want to crush that little ditz ""annointed messiah"" took out on a date in his non-post-it note car. Waaaah.&nbsp;

So in conclusion, see what happens when Sara sprains her ankle? The whole world is thrown off tilt! Nah, but I do hope you're ok!"

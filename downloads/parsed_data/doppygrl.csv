"event","ok.. now my grandpa is goin to move up here... he was ganna be here yesterday... but his car broke down on the way.. so my dad and a friend of the family went to go pick my grandpa up... i had two bedrooms but now i have one... witch is cool with me... my mom is so happy that he is move back in with us... he lived with us in miami and then when we moved up here where i live now, he went and lived in orlando this is son (my uncle)... well that house is fallin apart... but i guess no one cares... i kno my cuz's dont... so that dont help... maybe if they were ok with everything and stop bein rude and callin our family asshole's and everything else and stop and think how much my uncle did for them, then maybe they wouldnt be like that... BUT i doubt that... my cuz amanda got her head so far up her ass that it aint even funny... she just wants her way.. she wants to be with her LOSER boyfriend... i wanna beat his ass... and my aunt favors her other duaghter krista... krista gets wat ever she wants... they pay more attenion to krista then amanda and is has always been that way... maybe if they pay attenion to amanda then she would leave that asshole... instead of calling the family an asshole... everone in the family was good to those grls... but they are NOT greatful for it... they didnt have moch with my uncle and my aunt got married.. and my uncle said he would do anything to give them a better life... yeah my uncle can get upset at times... but the grls dont help... im sorry but if your infront of your parents with your boyfriend, you DONT be all over eachother... its not right... thats rude... but like i said krista can do watever she wants... but watever... if those where my sisters and they didnt have respect for our parents then we would be outside fighting... bc you dont disrespect your parents... but anywayz my dad and my grandpa and our friend mr. joel our on there way back.. they should be here in like 2 hours... so i have to go... im ganna watch a movie until they get here... ttyl xoxo muah bye"

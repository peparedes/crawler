I'm home for winter break, and back to work, too. I love having a job to come home to, especially since I'm dangerously low on funds. Can't wait for the Xmas windfall! =) 

I caught an episode of BUFFY this morning on FX! I'm sad that there is no FX at school. Sigh. At least there is Nick@Nite. Speaking of Nick@Nite, I saw an ep of Rosie that I'd never seen before last night, where Jackie buys the house that Dan built ... this is so random lol. I have nothing to write about, really. 

I saw Blade: Trinity the other night, and I liked it! Well, vampires, so of course I'd like it. Jessica Biel was HOT. I want arms like that. It had cheesy dialogue, but decent action, and I like how it was low on gore since the vamps just disintegrate when killed. Nice. 

Movies I MUST see(i'm such a movie whore ...):

It has been a long, long while since I bothered to update this sucker. And though I haven't been here for such a long time, I still have very little to say. 

Let's see ... I saw the Stepford Wives last night, and I loved it! Nicole Kidman was fantastic, and the movie itself was very amusing. Only a few days ago did I see the ORIGINAL Stepford Wives, which was very slow moving and had a very eerie, what the !? kind of ending. The new one went sooooo quick and wrapped things up neatly (and hysterically). I don't really understand why people didn't like it so much! It got crummy reviews from critics as well as the public. Maybe because they expected an exact remake? I did too, before I realized that finiding this new one as more of a mockery of the old one was the more effective way to do it. 

I am back at work now! Fresh-obsessed. It's bad, but not THAT bad. I began work on May 28th, the day I got home from school, and continued to work straight through until June 10th. And for the first two weeks, I did not even recieve a paycheck! Turns out the results of my drug test were never faxed to the main office, so I was not on the payroll, and was considered a frickin' volunteer, more or less. I finally did get paid, and was happy with the results, but DUDE. I was scrambling for the money to pay for my UsWeekly habit for quite a few days. Thanks to everyone who helped me out in these hard times. 

WELL, that's just about everything. I'll try to be more conscious of when I update. SoooorrY! 

Love, 
Big Red"

"event","It has been a long time since i paid this site a visit. Can't really say i've been too busy to post; it's more like inspiration just hasn't kicked in. But today, i feel it's made a reappearance. 

The end of the year is fast approaching, but there is so much yet to be done. I'm plagued by a slight case of stress. The symptoms of this would include: being able to function normally most of the time, yet feeling depressed and lackadaisical at odd times in the day, mostly when alone and towards the middle of the day, trapped in between classes. I hate sitting in class when i know there is so much to be done outside of it. And thennn i get outta class and feel so damn tired from just sitting there and worrying all of my energy away. So of course, this calls for a nap. Ahh the vicious cycle. 

But i plan to draft the final version of my research paper tonight. And to begin my lit & literacy project. Please please please give me the inspiration to attack this task with as much joy and enthusiasm as i have at the moment! Ugh, that's frustrating ... when all of your plans seem so lovely until you actually have to carry them out.

That 13 Going on 30 movie is coming out this weekend. I managed to grab a sneak preview, and wasn't too impressed. (SPOILER ALERT) Jennifer Garner is cute, but the 30 year old version of her character is terrbily disturbed and of course 13 year old Jenna Rink plans to ""fix"" this in one fell swoop. She winds up getting screwed anyway, and the ending is kinda disappointing and not as dramatic as i would have preferred. I mean c'mon, wishing dust made this girl's dream to skip 16 years of her life come true, why can't she just get the guy in a somewhat unrealistic, skeezy way? Instead it's as if the whole movie didn't even happen, and i'm mad that i wasted 8 dollars just so Jenna Rink could go back in time to change her destiny. But i guess the real message is to never miss a chance with anyone worth missing. Don't let people go, and know who your true friends are. 

Instead, I would reccomend The Girl Next Door. The movie's over-the-top and fun, sweet and sappy, dirty and devilish, all at once! I loved it. Elisha Cuthbert is pretty darned hot, but i really do think she adds a certain amount of flair and humanity to her character ... even if it's only that evident in the motel bedroom scene (tears in my eyes ... ). Emile Hirsch is adorable and honest and true, and his fantasies are every ""good kid's."" His friends are absolutely charming, and Timothy Olyphant, as the film's villian, squeezes his way into the darkest corners of your heart. And Richard from Sex & the City is in it! Yup, the man who made Samantha catch monogomay. I hope y'all enjoy the flick as much as I did. 

Another good movie is BIG FISH. Tim Burton has a real masterpiece here ... i was entranced, delighted by the images on the screen and the interaction between a father and son who never quite 'got' each other. 

Ahh some more movies to skip would be ""Johnson Family Vacation"" and ""The Prince and Me."" The former was just plain silly, while the latter was suprisingly sucky. Julia Stiles hit her prime in ""10 Things I Hate About You."" Well, it's true, that the movie was just horrible, trying to go into too many directions at once and trying to warp the distinction between fantasy and reality, and Julia did do her best to make us want this movie as bad as she must have. But i think Julia's always going to be labeled the ""angry feminist,"" more or less by her own accord. I guess I'm just sorta sick of it. 

Ha, yeah. My life's all about the movies. Hey, I don't wanna divulge anything TOO private on here. Films hit me close to the heart =)

I'm going to give a shoutout to Whitebread here: thanks for the milk. I feel much more mellow ;)

Oh and also, ALL HAIL E-DOG. For helping me to find the doink doink... and the trivalities of a doomed relationship (Spuffy!)."

"event","Went to the Strokes concert last night; it was awesome. Those guys f'in rock. They grow on me more and more with passing time. Julian Casablancas was on fire; the last two times I saw the Strokes in concert, Jules was rather complacent and most likely very stoned. This time, however, he radiated with joy and compassion for the audience. He mingled with the crowd, sang a few extra songs. The Strokes don't do encores. They are the Strokes, after all. 
The opening band, the Sounds, was from Sweden. Four gnarly guys and one cute peroxide blonde singer chick made for a pleasant way to pass the time. All of their songs sounded the same, but I guess so did the Strokes. They weren't bad. Not rushing out to buy the CD, but was still impressed by the little Gwen Stefani-ish chick's energy. 

I'm having one of those days where the day never actually got started. Not that my day wasn't rich and full and lovely, it's just that I feel I haven't actually done anything that will carry over into tomorrow. So much stuff to be done, I guess is the problem. I don't even know where to start. 
During class, while I sit there pretty idly, I tend to jot down things I have to do throughout the rest of the day, even it's as menial a task as taking out the trash. As long as I can write it down and check it off and feel as if I have accomplished something. Maybe that's it. I wrote my To Do list too late today. There wasn't enough to put on there, thus not enough to cross off and inspire me.

i can see through the windows
so just open the door
we can't be lying to ourselves
with these carcasses on the floor
it's not like you didn't know
that this would never work
striving for the ideal ... 
can't you see where the demons lurked?
the rhyme and reason was off 
and it still is
don't worry about the end
there was never a start

"event","Today. Today has been a slower day. This morning, I woke up kind of late, worked out with my good friend Denise Austin, who always makes me feel so much better about myself with such phrases as, ""You can do it! Oh, you're doing a fabulous job!"" even though she actually has no idea what or how I am doing. Britney was my workout buddy; with the sexual strains of her voice, I was reminded of what could happen if Denise and I joined powers on a more regular basis. That would, of course, be to LOOK like Britney. Ha. As if.

I just returned from viewing Lost in Translation, a lovely film. Bill Murray is SEXY. Scarlett Johnansson was quite admirable, but I am a bit jealous of her good fortune and cannot come outright and say that she is an, um, OKAY, she's A GOOD ACTRESS. Ugh. I WANNA BE FAMOUS!!! But anywho, I thought her character was annoying. She wandered around in her underwear every morning after her husband left her to go take pretty pictures of a flimsy actress (who, by the way, was most certainly Sofia Coppola mocking Cameron Diaz). The picture came around to say that sometimes intimacy does not need to include the act of being intimate. For the main characters in this movie, it was all mental. 

This past Friday, I saw 50 First Dates, which was absolutely charming. With Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler, how can you go wrong? My only beef was that the film at first attempted to achieve the slapstick-y, balls out comedy of Sandler's previous hits. But by the end, it seemed to achieve an impressive balance between goofball comedy, sweet romance, and a realization that its subject matter was rather serious. I teared up a bit at the end; the love between the two characters appeared so genuine! Ah, maybe I am just a hopeless romantic. 

The next day, my mom and sister kidnapped me for a day of shopping at King of Prussia mall. I bought very little (I'm on a budget). Actually, the only thing I bought was a t-shirt at Urban Outfitters that said, ""Idaho? No, udaho!"" Megan insisted I get it. OH MY GAWD, at this mall, there was a Louis Vuitton store. And in Neiman Marcus, they sold the likes of Chanel and Gucci, and Marc Jacobs bags (these run for about 500 dollars, each) SIMPLY SAT ON SHELVES. NO GLASS CASES. This is when you know you're in trouble. We then stopped by Nan & Mary's (you might know them as the pyromaniacs). They are the jolliest homeless people I've ever known. 

That's all, folks. Unless my Life Excitement Level picks up, I will continue to regale you with dull tales, or just not at all. 

Peace out."

"event","I'm feeling a little anxious today. About going BACK. I even packed up all of my clothes, since I only tend to rotate a few outfits during the week. I know, EWWW! But I usually end up changing into my Superfresh uniform at some point during the day, so my clothes don't get too much wear and tear. Plus, I HATE CHANGE. So there. 
Speaking of the Fresh, I have had off four days in a row. This could have been more enjoyable had there not been a blizzard in the midst of these days off. So yeah, I'm going a tad bit STIR CRAZY. My mother kept telling me to go outside and run around in the snow for a few hours. I think I've worn out my welcome here. Maybe that's why I'm so anxious about going back to school? Because I WANT TO. I guess I am getting a little sick of things around here. Especially the fact that with even the threat of snow in the air my mother INSISTS upon driving me to work. Um, okay, I can deal with that. But when, on one of these days, when it doesn't actually do anything (this past Sunday, when the threat kept getting pushed back), she proceeds to let MEGAN drive the HONDA and pick me up ... GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Yeah, you could say I was a BIT ANGRY. Luckily, my mother was in the car with Megan, or it could have gotten really ugly. ""Oh, she wanted to drive to pick you up on her own, but I didn't think that would be a good idea ..."" DAMN RIGHT! UGH! I don't know how much I can take. If I don't drive to work on Friday, I will be, well, quite upset. ""Oh, so & so's mother lets them drive in this weather?"" OH MY GOD. ANYWAY ... I just hope she doesn't turn out like my grandmother, who calls every hour on the hour wondering how everything is, like it's her job to worry. She just calls up to make sure everyone is alive or something. I mean, c'mon. GET A LIFE. No offense, but seriously. This is the same woman who thinks she's going to get raped at 76, but doesn't worry about, say, her house burning down. HMPH. One day, she got upset with me because I dared to appeal her using a napkin as a setting place for a hot coffee pot while she went to get a cup. I mean, WTF. JUST LEAVE IT ON THE HEATING PAD. But yeah, so I jumped up and did freak out a bit. She got offended, told me she didn't want the coffee anymore, and that she was 76 years old and I should respect her, etc etc. I wanted to scream, SORRY, I FORGOT YOU ONLY BURNED ONE HOUSE DOWN! But, ahem, I should breathe. This was months ago after all, lol. 
I gotta get outta this house!!! 
You know what's upsetting? How some people just don't tell you things. Like you trust someone so much and you find yourself telling them everything and involving them in every aspect of your life, and they don't do a damn to include you in their's. I know I'm overly sensitive, but it comes naturally to me to include this person in my life and it's such a trauma for them to tell me things and let things out. And then they got all wimpy and annoying when you try to voice your concern about this. BUT THEY DON'T CHANGE. THEY NEVER CHANGE.
As I said,I need to get outta this hizzouse.

"event","Hello, everyone. Good to be writing again.

Three more weeks til school! Ah, the suspense has been lessened from that dreaded countdown at the beginning of this past semester. But still, I'm a bit unnerved by it all. It is going to be so much easier, moving in and all, but starting new classes scares me. AHHH! I'll save the worries for a couple more weeks.

I've had the past two days off, which is always pleasant! Yesterday, my sister and I went to a screening of The Butterfly Effect at White Marsh. I'd won tickets through Cranbrook Video. The movie, starring Ashton Kutcher in a (gasp) dramatic role, was suprisingly good (as was Ashton). It was interesting to see how, yes, everything DOES happen for a reason. 

Yesterday was also the day I came out.

Today, I caught up with my coworker, Sugar. She rivals my brood; 16 kids. I only have 14! Grr. Competition. 

My brother treated me to a movie this afternoon. It was Along Came Polly, which was pretty entertaining, if you love a few fart jokes but are still a romantic at heart. You really felt poor Ben Stiller's OCD-like pain. And Jennifer Aniston was cute, as always. It was interesting to see Rachel and Grace (Debra Messing)dueling over the same man. Sigh, the simple things I find such pleasure in. 

I then went out with Lisa to see Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!. Not what I was expecting. Kate Bosworth smiled and looked cute throughout the entire movie; I will give her that her final scenes showed something other than ""Aren't I adorable?"" acting, but they didn't make up for her lack of character throughout the rest of the film. Too bad they didn't show more of Ginnifer Goodwin, a cute buxom girl with more than ""six smiles."" Topher Grace wasn't much different from his That 70's Show character, and we weren't shown enough of his pain or why the hell he was in love with Kate Bosworth. I think any emotion went towards Tad Hamilton, played by Josh Duhmal or however you say his name. Yet his transformation was utterly unbelievable. Put quite simply, I could have made a better movie. 

Chasing Liberty was good, btw. Go with that if you want a romantic comedy. Mandy Moore is a goshdarn awful actress, but the movie was well put together and a side romance between Secret Service agents was enjoyable to watch. And Matthew Goode is CUUUUUUUTE!

Post any of your own movie reviews, I'd love to hear.

MONA LISA SMILE SUCKED. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!

Oh, and also post thoughts on the Britney Marriage. I mean WTF happened there!? I've decided it wasn't a publicity move, as I originally thought. I think the girl needs to go to rehab."

This is my third day off this week ... it's pleasant! The last couple of weeks have been hectic, what with the holidays and people liking to eat during them. I've spent a lot of money though, on my days off. I don't want to run into the same predicament as I did last time, so I should be more careful.

I hate fielding all the questions that the relatives have for you, trying to strike a balance between sounding smart and also like you're having fun. Do you know what I mean? ""So how's school going! Do you like it?"" ""Oh, yes, I love it!"" ""But you get your work done, right?"" I mean, what the hell. And you can't forget the snobby looks you get when you inform them of your major: Elementary Education. I mean IMAGINE THAT. What an idiot, she wants to be a teacher. JUST A TEACHER. Her parents are paying all that money so she can go to college to be a TEACHER. YOU KNOW WHAT!? STICK IT UP YOUR ASS AND MIND YOUR OWN FRICKIN' BUSINESS. I don't make fun of you for doing WHATEVER THE HELL IT IS YOU DO. 

I HATE THE HOLIDAYS.

Alright, maybe I'm being a little harsh. After all, waking up Christmas morning is still exciting: lining up on the staircases for pictures and whining because Dad's so slow at taking them, opening up all the thoughtful little gifts that Mom bought and ooing and aahing over them, waiting eagerly for the chocolate chip pancakes, contemplating going to church ... heh heh. That part? That part rocks. Ooo and the eggnog later ... okay, maybe I do like Christmas. I just have other issues, lol. 

DMX makes a lot of nasty gay references in this song, whatever it's called. Hmph. Methinks the muddafudda doth protest too much. 

Don't forget the O.C. is on tonight. 

Time to order pizza. PEACE!!!"

Here, sipping calmly on coffee and trying to ignore the fact that I have an exam in an hour!!! Thank you, Jen, for lighting St. Jude. And thank you also to anyone else who bowed their head in prayer. It's going to be a tough one ...

Who gets the urge to write in their live journal at 6:56 am? Dude, me. The pitter patter of my fingers on the keyboard helps to release stress, and last-minute studying tends to only increase my nerves. 

Today, I have to unplug the fridge. This is all so strange. It feels like just yesterday, I got to understand the fridge. And now Franklin will no longer be my chef ... well, for 6 weeks at least. He better miss me. Do you think all of the appliances will party while I am gone? Hmmm. Food for thought. Maybe not if they're all unplugged ... or maybe, that is when they really come to life. Um, time for another cup of coffee. 

Alrighty. I'd better get the move on. Goodbye for now."

Gwyneth Paltrow is pregnant & married. Things change so quickly. I thought she'd be single forever, and childless. She seems so icy, almost as if she's above the needs of the average human being. I'm thinkin' Mrs. Martin might have realized that with Oscar darling, Nicole Kidman, coming into HER own, it's time for Gwyneth to find comfort in areas of life that don't contain critical praise. Not to say Gwyneth's past her prime as an actress; I'm sure she'll be around for ever. But other actresses are edging her out as far as ""Busiest Hot Young Thing"" is concerned. 

I need to pack. I leave in three and a half days, and everything seems to be a mess. These last few weeks are quite confusing and crammed. It's kinda fun though. A lot of excitement and stuff to keep you busy. 
I've forgotten that Christmas is next Thursday. This could be ugly. I still have a TON of shopping to do, and no moola to do so with. I miss Superfresh, like whoa. I'm sure I'll be singing a different tune in a few weeks, however.

when it's cool, he wants it hot;
always wanting what is not.

This is kinda hard. What am I supposed to talk about? Josh says ""random shit."" Hmm. Let's see what I can do.
There's a Kelly Bundy lookalike on Roseanne tonight, rockin' the Lunch Box. And when I say rockin,I'm speaking of tables, ice boxes,  the works. Speaking of Kelly Bundy, have any of ya Bel Air-ites heard that Christina Applegate lives in Todd Lakes? I overheard the ladies at Safeway's Starbucks talking about her shopping in there. I would love to meet someone famous. I was thisclose to Cal Ripkin, Jr. at an Ironbirds game. Ooo! And Ann M. Martin signed a Baby-Sitters Club book for me at a book-signing, lol. AND I got the signatures of everyone in the Irish rock band Rubyhorse at a Mix106.5 concert. Mmmhmm. Yay me. My mother got her picture taken with Joaquin Pheonix. Grr.
Freaky Friday is coming out on video/dvd soon. That was actually highly enjoyable; I'd reccomend the rental. Jamie Lee Curtis is awesome.
Umm okay. I think I'm done for tonight. I really am a boring person. I think I'll go back to immersing myself in the Lovely Land of Linguistics.

"event","Mmm. As I was studying for linguistics this evening, boredom overtook me. I had an urge to check my e-mail, and then began to wander aimlessly through bookmarked sites once online (alas, there was no new e-mail). I came upon a LiveJournal bookmark and thought ""Hey! What a great way to draw out my study break!"" And so here I am. 
Yes, the title is a rip-off of the Paris Hilton/Nicole Ritchie reality show The Simple Life. My life lacks much complexity, so I figured it would be fitting.
I leave UDel on Thursday and don't return until February 9th. I plan to work and make lots and lots of money during this time period. I am broke. I think my dad wants to disown me. He hates people who can't keep their finances in order. I can't help it though. A girl has to shop. 
The weekend has been fab. My boy Kevin came up on Friday night, and there were good times, good times. We trekked to Subway on Main Street with Jess & Megan and contemplated the restaurant's unsavvy use of colors and music. Kevin kept attempting to convince the girls of my strangeness ... unfortunately, it was too late. Upon returning to my room, we partied until the cow came home ... that would be Roseanne. 
On Saturday, there was much chillage during the day. In the evening, my honey Zach made an appearance, treating me to dinner and a movie. We saw Something's Gotta Give, and that was certainly what it felt like. Though the film was an adequate feel-good romantic comedy with a predictable ending, it kept trying to go all psycho thriller on ya with supposed plot twists which only dragged the film out. Sigh. I give it two out of four stars. 
And then came Sunday. I have slept for most of the day. After a disappointing cup of coffee, I decided it was time for a nap. And naptime it was until about 6:30, when I arose with visions of dinner dancing in my head. My next exam isn't until Tuesday; it is Math251, Math for Elementary School Teachers. Go ahead and laugh, but this shit is HARD. I dread the date. At least I have tomorrow off ... and tomorrow the laundry WILL get done. Right.
Thank you for getting this far and paying attention to me. I'm done for now. I'll probably update later tonight, since I'm currently fascinated with my new toy. 
TATA FOR NOW!!!

"event","I never update my journal anymore.... sorry.... I'm always busy. so..... nothing much is happening other than dance and school. I'm really really stressed tho about dance...... I feel like everyone thinks i'm this great dancer when i'm not. I'm doing this dance for beechmont players and there are gonna be all these big name ppl coming to watch the play and greg and I are the only ""kids"" or young ppl in it and we r also the only dancers. There is this guy from broadway coming and all these other ppl and I really feel like this could be a major turning point here. LIke..... if I was this awesome beautiful thin outstanding dancer then he would ask my name or at least notice me. idk its just really really stressing me out. Then Mrs. Erwin picked me for the overture awards.... and I really really need to do awesome there too bc u can get a scholarship and there r just alotta important ppl watching. I feel like there is this wall that I can't get over n i just keep hitting it instead of jumping over it and becoming a better dancer and there is so much room for dissapointment. My parents r always mad at me it seems. I'm always doing something wrong. The other day they got mad at me for taking a nap. I was so tired bc wednesday nite i didn't get any sleep bc i was up all nite doing my ap chem test and thursday nite i was up until 2 doing my hw n making my shirt for spirit day. so.. needless to say by friday after school i was pretty tired.... and i had dance that night and was planing on going to my homecoming football game afterwards..... so i took like an hour nap..... well apparently thats not ok to take naps when i'm tired. my parents got mad n wouldn't let me go to the game. thats how retarded they r. 

So as for HC at GE....... it went..... ok..... i do'nt even know how to put it other than just.... different. I went n got my hair done n tricounty  at 1 then came home n did my own makeup. Of course i've been so stressed out lately i get these huge stress bumps that look like zits all over n of course i had one right on my cheek. then I went to jackie's for pictures n then to kyle's where i stood because nikki and i were the only ones without dates.... yea that was not the most fun...then to nikki's for pics n then we went to dinner down n newport at pompilio's? idk how to spell it. dinner.... wasn't the greatest. everything was just.... intense.. on edge. then we went to nik's to grab her car.... stayed there for a bit then off to the dance. It was fun I danced with rachael n deb most of the time. I didn't end up dancing with ne one who promised me a dance but o well.... there were only two slow songs the entire time i was there n the dj sucked majorly. o well.... afterwareds we went to perkins me, neil, jack, nik, leanne, and joy. I swear i didn't fall asleep at the table lol. then afterwards i had to go home bc my parents r retarded and because i had dance the next morning. so jackie decided to leave us n go with laura n nikki took me home with the music turned up screaming lol. Sunday I went to dance where greg didn't show up which really makes me upset bc this means so much to me n he doesn't even show up for practice. well i have tons of hw so ...... leave me a comment....."

"event","Where do I start? I guess.... thursday? Tosha called n told me she just woke up at like 6 50 so I told my mom n she said she would take me to school. Well she ended up making me late like 30 min late n then she was really mad at me because I mad her late for her breakfast meeting that morning. So yea. the morning didn't start off well.. I've never been late to school except for like when I used to ride the bus in the bus was late. So yea... I didn't take it well. But ne way... Friday was boring. i only had three classes because of the block. then i went with Lea to this thing for Turpin's afterprom. Then I basically went to my house for like an hour n then Lea came n got me n we headed off to the game. Jack was already there tailgating. We got dressed and warmed up n went out to the feild in our outfits and full stage makeup hehehe. 12 of us from dance company performed at halftime.  It was.... ok? we've done much better in the past. Its really hard to dance on grass in jazz shoes. The rest of the game I actually watched with Jack n Sunny. It was awesome. We screamed n yelled n cheered. Then afterwards we left n went to Eric's for a bit n then Jack, Sunny, Chaz, Nik , n I went to applebee's. It was fun. i didn't go home till like 1 and no one was even waiting up for me. It was kinda crazy. I didn't get to sleep till like 4. I had to wake up at 7 to get ready to go to my hair appointment n Hyde Park. Then i went to my makeup appointment back at Eastgate Lancome. I saw tosha for a few. She was looking for an hc dress. Then I went home n got dressed for hc. em picked me up a lil b4 6. We went out to eat at max n erma's rach, her bf evan, erika, quido, lauren, her date named???, Em, nicole, doug, stephanie, erin and i. It was a lotta fun. ""Heather you look..... BLACk??!?!"" good timing there rach. lol then after that we arrived fashionably late to hc. I saw mr. wilson n all my old friends. It was so awesome to be back at my old school. I really miss it. I feel so comfortable there. its like...... idk.... hard to explain. but ne way. yea.... danced the night away. lol or as jay would say ""slut"" lol w/e. i don't care what ppl think. I had fun. My friends had fun. We all just went crazy. This was the best HC EVER!!! I am never taking a date to hc ever again. its so much better without a date. I danced with whoever I wanted whenever I wanted. there was no drama this year. We had an awesome time. I can't even remember everyone I danced with. lol  Then afterwards we pulled down a few things off the wall n headed to rach's to change. I am such a retard. I forgot to bring ne undergarmets with me lol so I barrowed em's bra and rach's tank. lol. thanks guys. So then we headed to brad's. Evan followed em and I. Well we got to brad's and they were sitting there watching football. It was really boring so we left n headed over to quido's party........ well.... we got pulled over by the cops. Em was freaking out Evan was calling his parents it was all crazy. Apparently we were ""recklessly driving"" and someone called us in. grrrrrrr freakin A! it was so stupid Evan pulled out in front of this off duty cop bc he was following us bc he didn't know wehre he was going so that was reckless driving. W/E it was so gay n the cop was so mean. He asked everyone to show ID. He made em and evan get outta the car. I was so freakin scared. lol so we were given a warning. lol then em n I headed to quido's and rach n evan went back to her house. we stayed at quido's till 1 30 or so n then left for rach's. I can't say n ething else about that nite. Overall I had an awesome time. It was an awesome nite. I miss everyone from old school so much now.... : ( I love you all tho and I had a fabulous time."

"event","I haven't updated in forever. I haven't had anytime and I really haven't felt like sharing my feelings. School is going better. Dance has started back up. I suck just as much as before. Basically every day consists of an hour n a half of dance at school.... three other classes then dance company for two hours after school then off to studio dance for three hours n then home to do homework all night followed by a few hours of sleep n then start all over again. My parents yell at me every day n tell me that I need to drop studio dance but I can't I love everyone way too much  the only thing that really sucks is you would think with all the dancing i'm doing I would be improving like a ton.... and I'm not.... I don't think i've improved at all. So yea..... Homecoming is coming up soon no date..... kinds sucks.... o well... w/e.... I got my dress yesterday... I don't really like it.... its black n has rinestone sparkles all over. kinda boring. Dance company turned out ok. I got the dance I wanted the pas de duex. I'm doing this dance thing for beechmont players so we'll see how that turns out. studio dance is going aight other than the fact that by time I get to the studio i'm completly wiped out. I can't remember if ne thing important has happened lately. 

I was looking back at pictures today. What happened? I used to be so cute. I used to be so happy. You could see it in my eyes, in my smile. It was straight from the heart. I'm so overwelmed. I'm so sick of myself. I've never hated anyone as much as I hate myself now. I looked in the mirror and I hate what I see. I've forgotten how to have fun. I've forgotten how to be happy. I've forgotten hot to just let go. Even at dance I don't let go anymore. I used to be the girl that eveyrone wated to be. Everyone used to be my friend. i was all the teachers favorites. guys had crushed on me. My parents trusted me and were proud of me. I was the smartest kid in the class. I was the best dancer in my class. I was the thinnest dancer in my class. what happened? Everyone else has a plan. Has a future. I don't know wat I wanna be. I don't even know wat i love to do anymore. Its pretty sad. I'm a junior in highschool and I've yet to have any purpose to my life. I have no meaning to my life nor anyone around me. Ever teacher I used to have used to say to me ""you have such a bright future heather"" "" you will go far and do great things"" I haven't heard that in a while. I feel like my whole life I've danced, yet I'm still not good enough to dance in life.  I'm never gonna be good enough to do anything with dance past highschool. And without dance I'm no one. But I can't dream for a future that I can't achieve. I used to be so sure of myself. I used to be so fun to be around. I could make anyone happy. Now I can't even make myself happy let alone anyone around me.  I hate what i've become.. I worry what others think of me.... I worry constantly that I""m dissapointing someone. I worry that I'm not thin enough or pretty enough or good enough. Sometimes I sit at lunch in just think.... ""just smile Heather then they will think its all ok."" And I do. ANd everyone sits there and goes on with their conversations, which is what I want. I am fine. my life is grande compared to many other ppl out there. I should be thankful for what I have. I mean.... when I think about it...... right now homecoming seems like a big deal and having a date and being seen as pretty and thin and wonderful and happy n cheerful. but.... in the big picture of things when I look back ten years later ... will that matter?  Will it matter that I think back to highschool n will have all bad memories? of no friends or bf's or dates or ne thing normal of a teenager? or mayb i'm just overreacting..... who knows? not me.... i'm hopeless and confused."

"event","I haven't updated in forever. I have absolutly no free time ne more. School started.. I'm at a new school. It's not what I expected. I ended up with lots of hard classes. I don't really feel like updating. I really wanna b able to say how much I love school now that I switched and how much fun it is. Its not. I'm already stressed out and I've had two days of school. The AP chem teacher told me he doesn't want me in his class bc i've never had chem.  I almost cried .... I NEVER cry in school .... i didn't cry... but i almost did... gosh.... not bc of the ap chem teacher tho lol  Everyone has changed so much since eighth grade. I've changed so much since eighth grade. I can't believe I'm saying this but... I miss IB. I miss the people in IB. I miss everything about IB. I miss being able to walk into a class and not having to worry who i'm gonna sit next to or if ppl r gonna like me or if i'm gonna have ne friends or if the teacher is gonna like me. I wish I could come back. I think I""m just hopeless. I don't think I will ever be happy. I haven't had ne fun in the two days i've been bak at GE. lunch sucks... i studied for AP chem tests both days. I feel like i'm the lil tag along girl. I want my own group of friends. I don't wanna be the girl sitting with other ppl i want to be the girl ppl r sitting with.. if that makes ne sense at all. there are like no guys in wecipa. the guys that r in wecipa r ugly or taken or i've already ruined ne possibilities of being ne thing with. and of course what would wecipa be without the paulharold wanna b. Cory idk his last name.... grrr..... there always hasta b someone smarter than me. ok i know its not that hard to be smarter than me. IB made me feel dumb.... ap chem makes me feel dumb... spanish III makes me feel dumb... mayb I am just really dumb. I've been off of dance now for almost two weeks....... omg..... ok i do not care what everyone else thinks i do not care if u wannat think i'm annarexic for saying this bc i know i'm right and i know i'm not annarexic bc i'm getting so fat. I don't know how not to. I've never really had to deal with this. like..... idk. I don't feel like me ne more. NO one understands bc no one really knew me b4 seventh grade which was when i was really thin. I just assumed i would b like that forever.... n now... i'm not.... n i dno't like it  at all. I dont' wanna hafta worry when someone lifts me if he's gonna think i'm heavy. I don't wanna hafta worry if i look good or bad in a leotard. I used to be so sure of myself n now i look n the mirror and see all these imperfections. I pick myself apart so how can others not? I hate myself so why shouldn't others? i used to be such an outgoing fun person. I've become this always depressed not happy unfun girl so i don't blame ne one for not liking me. plus the way i look i wouldn't wanna have a friend that looked as ugly as me either. not that ne of this matters. I don't know why I even write my true feelings n here ne more bc everyone just gets mad when i'm not happy  i think this might be the last entry. I don't wanna be sad. But I'm sick of pretending to be ok. I don't want ppl to feel sorry for me i don't want ppl to see that  i'm sad. but i hate hiding it. I hate feeling like this i hate having to look in the mirror n not feeling good enough. i feel like one huge failure. on big dissappointment. I'm never good enough well..... thats how i feel. I don't know how to feel differently I should be in studying for my ap chem test tuesday bc even if i study all weekend i will still prolly fail the test.... I guess some dumb ppl just cant' be taught"

1. We have been through so much. From the very begining holding  your purse on picture day in ninth grade we just clicked. School projects, Boxing matches with Rachel Sweet, hula girls at carnivals, inbetween class walks, theress too much to put down here. You are truly a great friend. I would do ne thing for you and I will always be here for you forever and always.

2. How come we always get the guy parts in all the english assignments?! You've made my two years in IB so much more fun. Gym class freshman year will never be forgotten. hahaha Plaid!! Look up and girl. wow good times. Don't ever forget me I know I'll never forget you

3. You tell it like it is and I love you for that. Although I'm an AnF girl and your a bargain hunter we still get along great! Spanish Class was the best! Even tho you are brave enough to stay in IB and i'm not we will still be friends. And I could never forget you because gosh you bought my first thong for me!! Wow.. so long ago... but good times 

4. Gosh what is there to say.... I met you when I came to GE in the middle of seventh grade. We didn't really hang out till freshman year when we both were doomed to IB. Even tho I think you like Mrs. Smith more than me and my parents like you better than me thats ok. I know you'll always be there to give me great advice whenever I need it. I'll try my best to do the same back . 

5. I've known you since I was 5. We both started dance at Bonnie's. We have grown so close since then. Uptown girls for life!! I can't wait till we open our own studio right next store to Bonnies and blow all our leaves into her yard!! hehehe 

6. We met in middle school when I moved to GE. I sat in front of you in Algebra and we made fun of Mrs. Brosmer together good times.. Lunch with teddy bear napkins. We both went through our ""bird stage"". I can't wait to come bak to GE we are gonna hang out so much more. 

7. We didn't really get close until the end of 8th grade and then I went to Amelia. We have so much in common we even use the same brand of tampons! lol Late night talks on aim when there is a thunderstorm. Next year we r gonna rock WECIPa!! I can't wait!! You rock my socks off! 

8. We have so many good memories. I just met you my sophmore year. We r too hot for you!! there r so many things I could put in here. We r both losers with no friends!! hehe I'll miss you if you move away!! but I know you'll come visit.

9. We both love cheating on vocab tests in english class. You love saleens I love boys who drive Saleens lol or used to..... lol You confided in me about your crazy night. I confided in you about my crazy nite. Wow what were we thinking?! but.... time heals everything right? haha we will see! I'm here for you!! 

10. Well... I felt I needed to put you in here even tho we haven't hung out in forever. I still feel horrible about homecoming last year..... PLEASE FORGIVE ME. I know you have but I will keep apologizing over n over again forever n ever. lol We both have strict parents that don't let us do ne thing... I think your a great guy n a great friend! I hope we can hang out sometime like we used to do last summer. 

Well there you have it..... sorry I'm not the best at stuff like this... I hope I didn't leave ne one out... although I know I did but I only had 10 spots. so guess who is who n i'll tell you if your right!!"

"event","Am I ungratefuL? am I a brat? At times I do feel bad for making my parents spend so much money on me... But in this case I don't. My brother was givin a car the day he got his license. I feel that I should get the same? I don't even care ne more if they give me the van. I just want something to drive to school and from school and when I have places I need to go. I'm sick of having ppl bitch at me when I need a ride somewhere and having to work around everyone elses scedule and mine when i'm making appointments so I have a ride. I don't think its fair to give my brother a car when he got his license and then buy a car now and ""share"" it with me. He gets to drive it to school and to baseball which means that I am never gonna get the car. I was being my complaining self and pouting about how I don't have a car of my own when my dad just went off on me about how I'm ungrateful and that I didn't even say thank you for him buying the car for josh and I to share n all this stuff. I mean..... I see his point..... He just spent tons of money on a new car n insurance n crap for it..... but..... What about my side? I mean josh gets everything n I get nothing..... thats not fair. But am I being ungrateful? I don't know if I should be sorry or sad or mad or what? They won't let me ride to school with ne one either... they are making me ride the bus... which isn't gonna happen bc if they say i'm allowed or not i'm getting a ride from TOsha. idk... I don't want to be ungrateful but I do wish things were fair. I really want a car . I really need a car. It would make things so much easier."

"event","I haven't updated in a while..... I just haven't felt like it. I've been dancing..... of course.... its choreography week up at the studio. I think I actually like the dance. lol its really cute. Its a prince song? i think? the songs called ""Its about that walk""? or sumthin like that. Wednesday Irving came over n we went shopping for Brit's present. Then I taught her the dance bc she wasn't there tuesday nite. Wow... tonite was..... an experience!! I'm n ""my"" car my mom is sitting in the passenger seat when these guys drive by n yell out the window ""hey sexy!!"" Freakin A! I'm with my MOM! how embarrasing. OMG! I went to Goodwill for the first time ever! EWWWWW! i'm never going bak. that place is so NASTY ucky gag! My mom wanted to buy a wheelchair for a gag gift for her friend at work. idk..... i don't get how that is funny but I guess its an inside joke. EWW i still feel SO nasty even walking into the place. And there are like people all around rummaging through dirty clothes. Can you believe they have a dressing room!? If you can buy clothes from there at least take them home n wash them first..... but trying them on not knowing where/who they have been on? ahhhh ewww that's just beyond gross!! My eyes were watering bc it smelled so gross. Thank goodness they didn't have a wheelchair lol not like it would have fit n the car lol wow..... so that was my first/last goodwill experience EVER. Ewwww I feel sorry for ppl who have to shop there...... I feel lucky to be able to buy new clothing now lol.  I think i'm gonna have nightmares tonite. I am dedicating next week to summer work. Its really stressing me out that I dont' have it finished. Although next week I am finishing driving school and dance possibly and helping paint the back room and I hafta find my first day of school outfit.... Ahhhhh I normally have my first day of school outfit by now. I'm starting to get worried. I've got tons of new skirts... but none are good enough for first day of school. help!! I found a super cute skirt at AnF but they only had it in 00 and when I buy 00 they aren't school appropriate length. grrrrr . So if ne one wants to go shopping ne time call me up bc I need to go shopping desperatly. O n I guess I forgot to mention... my parents bought me a car. I hafta share it with my brother tho. I""m so mad. He is gonna get to drive it to school bc he hasta drive from high school to college every day. I want my own car. I would have had my own car if my brother hadn't totaled the van! grrrrrr stupid brother lol well ne way .... yea... thats all for now"

"event","When I lived at my old house and I went to my old school and I was with my old friends **Turpin not GE** they decided they were gonna throw me a suprise bday party even tho I don't celebrate my birthday. It was the best birthday I've ever had. They made me a cake n gave me presents and it was all a suprise. I felt so special. I felt like they really did care about me. it was awesome. I know its just another day. I know that its no different then ne other day of the year. I just thought that mayb.... idk? I don't know what I expected. Mayb a happy birthday Heather? thats all I wanted. I just really don't feel that I have very many true friends ne more. Everyone is just sorta a friend when its convenient. I do have one true friend. Emily Smith. Gosh I love ya!! thank you so much Emily. I try to be a happy cheerful person. I'm not always but I try to pretend. Sometimes I'm sick of pretending that everything is wonderful. So when I stop pretending and I become me people get mad at me n tell me i'm trying to make ppl feel sorry for me. **not my intention**My bad that I was just being myself for a few moments. I'm sorry that I was hurt and sad but dont' worry you won't know ne more.... Everything is great everything is wonderful riiiiiggghhhhhht I hope your happy now"

"event","I had a really awesome conversation tonite. It made me realize a few things...... First that somethings never do change..... secondly that somethings are better left alone. There is this person who I used to like as more than a friend. It was never gonna work out but I still really liked him. And I think it was putting stress on our friendship bc I liked him. A while ago I wrote and entry about how he makes me wanna b a better person and how I feel good being around him. But u know what I didnt realize? I can still wanna b a better person around him I just don't need to be ne thing more than friends with him. I don't wanna be weird around him I just wanna be me... how it used to be. Some things just aren't meant to be..... this would be one of them. So I'm sorry for getting too attached I didn't mean for it to happen like this.... but we've put it in the past now i can just be me and u can just be you and we can just be friends 

On a different note....the studio is getting very ""clicky"" idk.... I really don't get why ppl act the way they do. And I feel so so so sorry for Emily. Do you ppl not realize she is the only one not in the ""small group"" dances for choreography week? This is her freakin SENIOR YEAR. But i'm not gonna say ne thing..... its not my place. I wish I could give her my spot tho. So Em I love you very much and I'm sorry that other ppl r so gay."

"event","Well...... I haven't really updated in a long time but its just because I can't write down whats been happening lately. but yea.... Last week was our last week of summer classes. I hate when summer classes end. Josh **my older brother** was outta town this week so I was stuck watching my lil bro all week during the day n that at nite I had dance. thursday nite... yea..... can't talk about that...... sorta wishing I could forget about that. idk. ne way. Friday I watched my bro n then ended up going out to dinner with my mom bc? idk bc of recent events I felt bad for not spending a lotta time with my family. Saturday was the yard sale for the studio. I didn't wanna go at all because I've been left out of everything lately n i was sorta mad at everyone n idk. But it ended up turning out ok. We ended up dressing up n costumes and standing out front with signs. The cops came. lol whoops. Then I went to Kenwood with Sunny, Jack, n Nik. That was fun I haven't hung out with sunny all summer. Then I was gonna go bowling with Jack n nik n kyle n ppl but that got cancelled bc Kyle had to bbsit. So then I went with my dad to his friends house to pick up a quad bc my dad is going atving without me yet again. So Em calls n wants to know if I can go to Anderson days with her n Rach. It was like 9:05 or sumthin n my dad was like ""no its too late!"" what? its freaking 9pm thats early. but w/e just another example of my parents being gay. Tomorrow is my bday. Uck. I hate my birthday. NO one every remembers it which is fine. My parent will either not get me ne thing at all or will get me something stupid that I don't want. All I want for my bday from them is a car. I want a CAR!!!!! grrrrr. But no I don't get a car. My brother gets a car right away when he gets his license. I don't. They r buying him a new car b4 they get me ne thing at all. So fair huh? but yea.... Is it possible to live your life without regrets? I thought I could. I thought I was........ till now..... I regret what I did. And everyone tells me its ok its ok...... but its not.  Idk I'm so confused."

"event","Wow.....well. about the last entry Sunny is right the past is the past and there is nothing I can do about it now except learn from it. I am who I am now because of my past. Today I was laying in bed with my teddy watching Dawson's Creek (yay! Jackie I finally watched it and yes it is AWESOME!!) when I realized this is my last week of summer dance at the studio. : ( I wish we had summer class all summer long instead of just 6 weeks. I love summer class because its not about learning dances or competition or ne of that stressful stuff. Its just about learning and gaining and becoming a better dancer. And I really wanted to improve this summer. and I think I did.. just not in the way that I thought I would. I thought I would become more flexible or improve my turns or something specific. But what I did learn was how to dance from the heart. I never really noticed before but I never really let go... i never really danced from within. it was always just one two three four five six seven eight two two three four five six seven eight. idk its hard to explain n most of u guys won't understand what im talkn about at all.but ne way thats all for now..... i should be doing my summer work for school lol ..... o n yes! Emily Hoke rocks my socks off!! hehehe"

"event","Wow.... Em just asked me sumthing.... its so weird... I can't believe I never thought about this b4. well here lemme start at the begining. Freshman year I was new to Amelia High School  because of small schools. I decided to go to IB. well it was picture day. This girl I was standing in front of tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I would hold her purse while she got her picture taken. I said sure. We ended up best friends. Who woulda known what a great friendship came from such a weird begining. Through out the course of Freshman year we became sickeningly close. We did everything together. We spent weekends together. We shared a locker. I mean everything u could imagine we did together. I couldn't go shopping without her. I didn't have an opinion without her. It was crazy. We were Best friends. THen Freshman summer I went to florida for like almost two months. It was really hard. But I came bak for school and we were great friends.... then idk what happened. I dont even remember exactly what we fought about. All i know is we lost it. We were mean to each other. We said mean things about each other. It was so horrible. I just remember feeling so sad inside so lonely because I didn't know what to do without my best friend. I found myself at home crying when i used to be out hanging out with Em. We didn't even talk for weeks. It was terrible. It was my fault. I don't remember what I did but I do know it was my fault. but ne way the whole reason behind this story is Em and I are friends again... not like freshman year.... but we have realized that we did have great times together n that we love each other n that we will always b friends. We r the kind of friends that might not see each other for a month but when we do hang out we have completly fun times. Its like we just click. idk but ne way, she asked me tonite if we had stayed best friends like we were freshman year would I be leaving IB next year like I am? wow.... how can I even answer that? I mean..... I think I would be a completly different person if I had stayed best friends with Em this entire time. Emily is just the kind of person who brings the best out in you. Now it leaves me with so many what ifs...
what if I would have stayed best friends with Em....
What if I would have kept my 4.0 gpa.......
What if I was staying in IB.......
What if I never danced .....
What if I would have made better decisions at homecoming lol..
What if.... theres so many what ifs..... I feel like every decision I make now effects the rest of my life....   If i was still best friends with Em would I be staying in IB? wow.... what a question"

I wish I would have gone to florida for the summer like i normally do. o well... too late now bc I have dance n then after dance i hafta take driving school and then school starts. I'm really nervous about school. Idk I don't want to dissapoint ppl. Idk i've just been really bummed lately. And I hate that i'm so depressed all the time but I can't pretend to be happy ne more. I gotta take a break and just be me. I'm starting to scare myself too. Normally I lose tons of weight over the summer n then gain some weight n the winter etc. I haven't really lost ne weight this summer : ( Idk I guess I eat more or sumthing? o well......

But yea.... so I think I know what I wanna do, now I've just gotta get my parents to be ok with it. Tonite was a really good nite at dance. I loved the combination we learned and idk.. I just really let go, danced from the heart. Wow I got my scedule for studio dance next year and I counted all the hours. I'll be dancing next year for 11 hours a week with studio dance alone (Monday-Thursday and Saturday)...... thats crazy! plus i have dance company plus i'm dancing during the day now. Plus the other part of my decision if I have time yikes! But i love to dance so it should b fun. I got home from dance and worked on my ap chem for over two hours and I still dont' have even the first chapter done. I'm hopeless. Well tomorrow I'm supposed to go shopping with Jackie!! I can't wait. Its been so long since we've hung out I gotta find a really cute bathing suit for a really cute person lol jk I am still searching for the perfect first day of school outfit. Any ideas?

WEll I decided to wear a spiderman backpack. Rachel looks at me ""gosh Heather that looks uncomfortable"" lol well.... i decided to make a pile of bean bag chairs and run and jump on them lol ... whoops forgot i had a skirt on..... some people were looking at me funny.

I dance and they say o well you didn't point your toe hard enough on those one turns or O i don't like that dance. Its never wow good job Heather that really looked good or Thank you Heather for spending your entire day cleaning OUR house or wow Heather thank you for staying home all day with your little brother when you could have been out with your friends. They say I don't appriciate anything ....hmmm wonder where i get that from? Everything I do they find something wrong with it and thats all the remember. I hate dissapointing people and thats all I can seem to do with my parents. They never let me do anything. Honestly ask any of my friends and they will tell you my parents are strict. I'm not allowed to date, not allowed to ride in cars with most teenagers**theres a few exceptions**, not allowed to go to parties, not allowed to stay out really late the list goes on n on. And they say they are ""protecting"" me. how so? by ruining my teenage years? I can never screw up ever. If I do anything slightly wrong they will take away dance. Once I rode with Erin's mom in a car to get my haircut because I had an appointment and my brother wouldn't take me. THey took away dance for a week. I didn't even do anything wrong? did i? grrrr someone please trade me parents. lol 

Well on a brighter note.... Nationals are today and tomorrow!!! whoo  I really hope we do well. I wouldn't mind winnng some cash for the studio for first high point lol OMG the sweet sensations are so ADORABLE!!! well... im off to get my costumes and makeup ready!! whooo I can't wait to dance for the first time in a while with two good legs! hehe!! Wish me luck!! and don't worry I won't hurt myself again! i hope lol 

*it may seem crazy* 
..If i wanna dance in the rain.. 
*but little things like that* 
..take away my pain.."

Kim n Kristie were there but that god they didn't see me so I walked on by lol. Well I ended up going back to the mall later that night with Erin bc we couldnt' decided what we wanted to do. After the mall we decided to go to Best Buy just for old times sake. Then we stopped at hh greg where Erin proceeded to sing karyoke in the parking lot. lol wow lol and there was this guy there and I was quietly commenting to Erin about the song ""larger than life"" and I said larger than life in many ways. and this guy comes over n puts the camera on me and says omg u like them big? n all this stuff it was so horribly embarrasing. lol well then there were these guys that were walking and I decided it would be fun to holler at them as we drove by..... so i yelled ow ow! hottie! lol (they were butt ugly) but then the light in front of us turned red. we had to stop and they walked almost right up to the car when the light finally turned green and we went as fast as we could lol. We then proceeded to visit Zach at work. We asked him what we should do **wrong answer** His suggestion was to go get drunk lol. so we went n got dessert n then i went home.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMILY SMITH! whooo hoo 17!!! And she got her cast off!! Darn no more cherry flavored starburst arms. lol. 
   On a different note, I've been thinking lately(iknow i know crazy huh?!) well I asked myself ""If I had to choose between staying somewhere I love or going somewhere else and becoming better which would I choose? Idk I've already changed so much for next year. Changing schools.... idk I don't know if I can just throw everything I used to call home away and start completly over. Its hard to explain and I can't go into detail because of people that might say something to other people lol complicated  I know. I want to be  great. I don't want to be average, normal, just ok. I want people to look at me and say ""wow she's great"" and where I am right now I can't be great, but I don't want to leave the people I love. I don't know if I can be happy if i'm not improving anymore tho..... I'm so lost and I've got to make up my mind soon. And if I leave the place I love and I go and try to become great and I fail I don't know if I could handle that. I don't even know if I can be great....... I really wanna try tho. IDk what should I do? stay in the place I love.. or leave and try to become great?"

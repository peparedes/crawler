"event","Some days I want to give my boss a medal and have her name written in the sky as the best boss ever. Today is not one of those days, today she pissed me off big time. I do and do for that company and get very little except her praise. I come in early, I work extra, I get my stuff done, I do as I am told and yet after three years I am still minimum wage, very low benefits. (unless you count the two weeks paid vacation a year, that is nice.) Now today she asked me to stay an extra half hour, which is fine, but I wasn't able to tell mother before she started out to get me. Now she told me it was fine that she would wait the extra half hour in the car and it would be good. So I told my boss and she agreed. Now when the time came for me to leave there were still people to be helped on the counter and she wouldn't help me or let me leave, thus making my mother wait an extra fifteen minutes out in the car. 

All in all that was terrible, my boss should have helped me, or let me go, and after my mother came all the way out there to pick me up. Sorry, I know this is a very weak rant, and such but it pissed me off, I care about my mother and don't like to put her through that if I can help it.

Alright rant over, I am off for the day. Thanks for reading."

"event","A random thought that I had at work and just had to put to paper, err screen.

I was thinking, what is a soul mate? Someone who is perfect, or perfect for you, if so then it doesn't exist for no one is perfect. But maybe that is wrong, what if it does exist? What if your soul mate is someone you can just be with. What if they are someone that you see and love, that you know their flaws but don't care, and don't want to change them cause you like their flaws. Maybe they are someone that you be yourself around no matter what, even when you don't like yourself but still can't help but be comfortable in your own skin around that person. Maybe they are that one person that can get you to smile and laugh no matter your mood. Someone who you can just be with, that you don't need to do anything, and still be happy. 

Who knows, maybe they aren't that prince you think about in your dreams who can give you everything you want and sweep you off your feet and ride off in the sunset. Maybe that prince is the worst person for you, maybe after he gets you to his palace you end up being miserable. Maybe that super cute guy you drool over at work is in fact a nerd at heart, or maybe he is jerk, or the sweetest person in the world. Maybe that nerd you ignore at work that stalks you all over the place is a sweet heart, and if you would only give him a chance he could brighten up your life in ways you couldn't imagine, or maybe not. You never know, so many people around you, so many personalities, so many life styles. How are you suppose to know what makes you happy when everyone is telling you how to be happy, why to be happy, and what to be happy with. Everyone's happiness is different, comes from a different source.

(almost got off track there) If you don't know what makes you happy, how can you expect another person to know that answer, and yet we are constantly looking for our ""soul mate"" to do just that. I say we should sit still and be, relax and live. Find our own sources of happiness, if you know how to be happy on your own, you can find happiness with another. It is then  you can find that one person for you. 

I think I have found my love, he is someone that I laugh with, chat with, play with, and am happy with. Even though he still doesn't know my feelings, for I haven't told him, I know them. I have spent so much time, trying to figure out if I just wanted him to make me happy, or if I wanted him for him. With much soul searching I have found that, even though my life could be better, I am happy, and truly content. I have family that loves me, I have friends that stand by me, I have a future ahead of me, and have come to terms with my past behind me. So I find still that love this man, and know also that I love him for him, his silliness, his charm, his knowledge, his self, the whole thing. Now I know he has flaws as we all do, and they don't faze me, I love him no less for them.

I know I love him for him for other reasons as well. I can think, to the future, and feel that I could live with him forever and be happy. I am the type of girl that refuses to have children for reasons of my own, but if we ever married, and he asked me for  a child, I would give it to him, no hesitation. At the same time though I am willing to speak my mind to him, and let him know if I am truly unwilling to do something, even for him, because it goes against my honor. 

Heh, I guess, what I am saying is that a soul mate is someone that you can live with, be happy with, give and take with, grow old with. Someone that you can just be with and be happy, you don't need anything else, just live your life and happiness finds you every day. Who knows how many people out there meet those expectations for me, or anyone else, but all I know is that I have found one, and I know I shouldn't let him go.

And that is my random thought, enjoy."

Alright lets get down to business, I am no longer in school and am now working, and have dropped my major completely from school. When I go back I will be going for either Physiology, or being a caregiver, or a combo there in. My job stinks, I work at a deli, good work, bad environment, you know how that goes. 

Sadly I have lost a few of my dear friends, and it was completely my fault to, I was a jerk and deserved what I got. I don't expect them to ever talk to me again and don't blame them. Now even with that sad loss, I have gained more friends, and with those friends have developed a few new obsessions. I almost never play Magic, or dnd any more, but I am now an Anime freak. I am also a Wow addict. Sad, yes I know, but it is better than some addictions out there, can't think of any at the moment but that doesn't mean they don't exist! Of course my dragon obsession is still running stronger then ever. Even though I fell out of dnd several years ago I am trying to get back into it with a new friend that I just recently met.

I have also found that, even though it was a good choice for us at the time, my breaking up with my now ex Ian was, well, good then, bad now. I want him back more than I can possibly describe. When I am with him I am content, I don't feel the need to be something I am not, I don't feel the need to impress him, I can just be and be happy! It is a happiness that I have yet to find anywhere else, and it is becoming like a drug that I am addicted to. I am a sad excuse for a human being, and don't deserve to have him, but the part of me that believes that is only a small part now. Even with that though I can't tell him, I don't have the courage, and most likely never will.

And with that, life goes on I guess. I don't expect anyone but me to read this, it is mostly for my reference, so I am sorry for the bad grammar where it exists, etc. At least for those that do read it."

Wow, much has happened sense my last post. First, Ian's birthday, I don't think he came over on that day though. I manged to get him what he wanted this year, I didn't think I would have enough money, but I did. He was very happy with his gift, and I am happy that he is happy, of course.

Second, happened the same day, we broke up. Seems sad, yes, but it was for the best, we are happier as best friends, so it was not a sad moment.

Third, Halloween, I didn't dress up, we didn't decorate, but we did get more kids this year than last year. (3 vs 8)
 
Forth, MY ART CLASS SUCKS!! I just had to get that off my chest.

Fifth, I am going for a job interview today, YAY!! It is for JcPennies, sure it is just a winter job but it is extra money so I am happy.

Well that is everything I think, if I missed anything I will add it later most likely, or something."

Make sure to post this rule clearly! At the end of your 6 weird/things/habits, you need to choose 7 people that you would like to be tagged and write their names down.</i>

1. Lets see, I am forgetful. aka it takes me forever to memorize something, and then if I don't use that knowledge in the near future, or very much I just forget it, even if I don't want to. (Even worse when it comes to names)
2. I scare easily, not as in scary movie stuff, but as in when I feel someone is mad at me or something similar.
3. In reference to the one above, when scared I tend to fret, pace, worry, get jumpy over it, no matter how small. (ex: when a teacher tells me to pay attention in class.) it is sad but I can't help it.
4. Around the holidays I have a bad or good habit, depending on your point of view, of getting too many gifts for others, while leaving my mom hanging with a nonexistent list for me.
5. When I was a baby my I accidentally fell on my head.(of which I will blame every now and then for my bad speech and terrible memory.)
6. I get edgy, and tense when placed in charge of children, they just scare me when I am supposed to be in charge, while on the other hand they love me for some odd reason...still trying to figure that one out.

Now the hard part, tagging others....

I finished all the in class work, the homework and I have even read the next chapter for next week, if I had that homework I would most likely have that done as well. I swear that if I could find a test for MS Word right now I would ace it or something.

Anyway, enough complaining from me. I thought I would post and tell about this cool bumper sticker that I saw on the way to school today. It said ""My gamer kid frags your honor student."" Hehehe, anyway I thought it was cool, you have all most likely seen it many times, but I still think it is cool. Let me see now, oh yeah! I have this frined from high school who graduated one year before me, anyway she is in my art class this term, and she is a major anime and manga fan. Well she followed me after the class to the student lounge and talked to me about one anime called ""Fruits Basket"" (I think that is the spelling for it...) for a half an hour, which is how long my lunch time is. Lets just say she loves to talk, and admits it, that and her vast knowlege for anime and manga gives her plenty to talk about, hell she even convinced me to see or read the one she was talking about. Well enough about that for now, lets see anything else... minus the fact that I am struggling to grasp the mass majority of what is going on in the art class, nothing much. Oh yeah, I only have one class tomorrow, because my writting 80 teacher is sick and told us he was going to the doctor, so yay! I think that wraps up everything... at least I think it does.

Well I am going to end this post before the teacher notices that I am not doing any work (like I have any to do right at the moment).

In other news we buried Scarlet yesterday, now she has her own little spot in our back yard where I can plant flowers for her in the spring. I still look for her every morning though and it is truly upsetting when I don't see her sleeping on my feet at the bottom of the bed. Oh well life goes on and I have 4 other fuzz balls to keep me company, one of which is doing his absolute best to hog all of my attention, that includes right now as I try to type over him while he rubs against my arms and the keyboard.

Well not long after I posted that I got a phone call from my mom telling me that I was to go to work with her so we could be together because she had just gotten a call from the vet saying that Scarlet had passed on while they were taking tests to see what was wrong. I am a mess right now and it is hard to type but I want to say something to someone other than my mother and talking is a little too hard right now.

She was the first cat I got when I moved here. I raised her from a kitten and had her for around five years now, she was my baby and I will miss her dearly. I wish I could say what I feel but that is currently not possible, she meant more to me then I could possibly describe. I just hope I can pull myself together before school starts, and as of right now I don't want to deal with my Birthday. As well for a while I hope my friends can understand that I will seen very distent for a while and I am sorry if I seem cold during that time.

"event","Well as the title states, I have had a bad weekend. First my mother scares the hell out of me by vanishing for most of a day and doesn't contact me tell the next morning, she normally at least tells me that she might be gone for the night or that she is going somewhere and I am suppost to pretend not to know where. 

Then the next day my baby girl Scarlet (My cat for those that don't know her) started acting strange. Normally she is following me around the house, meowing for food or attention, or both, and has at least a little spunk. Well not yesterday, for most of the day she just slept in this one chair, never asked for food, didn't even show ANY interest in the food I set out for her and her youngest son Ian. Now what is worse is that she was throwing up most of the day, not drinking any water from what I recall, and she didn't even have the will to go from my bedroom to the litter box and thus urinated in my bed (Of which I ask if anyone knows how to get cat urin out of a matchres[sp]? Or at least knows how to get rid of the smell?) So I took her to the Vet this morning and they said they would contact me when they found out what is wrong. Thus ends my weekend, not as bad as some I have had, or some that my friends have had, but still a scary and stressfull one all the same.

Also I still haven't figured out what I want to do for my Birthday, which is tomorrow, and with Scarlet at the vet's I might just say hell with it and worry about it later or something. Anyway that is the end of my complaining for the day, thanks for reading."

Now lets see, Oh yeah, I wanted to talk about a dream I had a few nights ago that has me thinking, wondering, whatever. What I remember from it was that me and my mother were traveling by car to Reno or Las Vegas, couldn't tell which. When we were just outside the city we stoped at a strange resturant or gift store, or something along those lines, and for some odd reason the dream kept shifting from night to day, which was all the more odd. Well when we stopped to go inside, I stayed in the car, telling my mom I would be in a minute, and then started messing with something, I don't remember what though. Then out of no where these bulls show up, not foaming at the mouth, but still going crazy. I think it was a look in their eyes or something. Anyway, they started to attack the jeep, seeming to try and get at me for reasons unknown. Through the whole attack I was paralized with, not fear, but something else like understanding or something, I don't know it was very confusing. Well the bull that was attacking my door slammed against the window three times before shattering the glass, and when it did one of it's horns hit me in the chest, killing me. It was that exact moment that I woke up.

*Shivers* I hate these kinds of dreams. Ok I can't really say that because the last time I remember having a similer dream was back when I was six or seven. That dream basicly showed me and sis getting on my mom's 4-wheeler, starting it up and driving it in such a way that it fliped completely over, and we ended up snapping our necks. I can still remember many of the details of that dream, which is interesting, I normally don't remember any of my dreams after 24 hours, let alone years.

Anyway, that is just something that has been on my mind when I have nothing else to do. Now on to what I consider a more important subject. I FINALLY GOT MY COMPUTER BACK!! Yay!! *Dances* 

Thus far I have downloaded all the game I can, that I have that is. All except DragonShard, for some reason that one won't download, and Ian spent at least a couple of hours trying for me before he gave up. Other than that and the fact that NWN's grafics don't want to work right (everything is jerky, and won't move smooth like before) there are no problems. Yay!!

So as far as I can tell, besides D&D, there hasn't been anything else going on that I need to mention, I hope..."

"event","The last time I posted I had bad and good things to talk about, that was over a month ago. I have to admit that March was the month from hell, at least for me even though I know it could have been a whole lot worse if two things had happened.  Well anyway those two things didn't happen so I managed to live. Well I am not making this post to talk about things that I have already talked about, nor is this post to talk about the things that could have happened to make it all worse. No this post is for venting about this month, sorta.

This past month has been a breeze compared to March, but still is not exactly what I would call wonderful for several reason I will not explain for personal reasons. I guess it is probably just because I am tried that I feel the way I do now, or it could be something else, I am not going to even begin to guess at the reasons. As far as I can tell though it is all me right now, I am seeing things that are not there, I am feeling like I have no use to anyone anymore, and never did even, and a bunch of other things. I tell you this only because I need to vent as I said, to regain control of myself, for if I don't I know the outcome, I lived through it once already. Not pleasant trust me.

Sure, I know it is very selfish of me, very greedy to feel the way I do for there are those that live through worse and are fine, happy, and all that. Maybe, maybe not, I might not even be making sense right now, I don't care if I am or not, I'm scared, just as I was scared before. I was always scared, sad, and lonely before, with no one to listen to me so I could vent. I don't know if I am going through the same things now or not, for there is a difference between then and now. I have friends, I have my mom to listen to me, and I have more options on what I can do to feel better. Thus I am not as scared as before, I know I will be fine, before I didn't have that comfort, and most likely I am feeling down only because my body is still unhappy with me from the trip, it has been telling me as much, which is scary all by itself. Well I am feeling better now that I have vented my emotions. At least those that I feel comfortable telling at the moment.

Thanks for hearing me out, there is no real reason for anyone to pay any attention to this post, it was mostly for venting purposes."

"event","I know it has been a while sense I posted, but oh well I have been busy.  One of the things I have been busy with is school, of course, and now finals are finally over, of which I am very happy about.  Then there are my hobbies, I am trying to get back into playing Magic of which I still enjoy playing, but sadly have had no time for it at all, and of course D&D, that hobby I have simply been making time for, but over all it has not cut into my school time at all, of which I am very grateful.

Now as for school I believe I will pull off this term with A's and B's, but I haven't received my grades yet.  The only class I am worried about is Intro to Business, that class has been a pain, for there are no tests, only in-class quizzes, and as you know I was gone a lot this term, what with my vacation and all, thus the quizzes and assignments that were in-class will be dropping my grade, as far as I know, by a lot.  That and the project, he was not very clear about it and because I didn't understand what he wanted fully, I had to go back at the last minute and re due the whole thing....Well, other than that all my other classes are good.

Wednesday my Uncle, Aunt, and baby cousin came down to visit for a day, and that was wonderful and all, but there was a problem.  You remember what I said about my vacation, about all the stuff my mom said and what not, well she did it again.  The whole time they were here, she was talking trash about me, ordering me around like I was some hired servant, and she never did that before....oh well, I will talk to her about it the next time I see her and see if I can't get this all figured out....

Anyway, that is my life as it stands....oh and my sis is going to be over tell the 31, which will be interesting...."

"event","Ok, I feel like shit still, I got this blasted flu bug around Monday, but it didn't fully kick in until the end of Tuesday, lucky me....I am just lucky my friend was there at the end of the day to give me a ride home as normal, for I was about ready to drop when I got home, or at least that is what I felt like.  Now because of this stupid bug I am almost a week behind on homework, and that is bad, for we are coming up close to finals week, and what is worse, I have a big project due next week and another due the next day after that, both of which are not done yet.  Then on top of that I have a test to make up in one class, another to take today, of which I am finally feeling better enough to go and take.  I guess I am just going to have to lock myself in my room this weekend until it is all done, of which I hope I have enough time.

Over all I am scared and still sick, sorta, which is a bad combo in my opinion, for it makes mistakes all the more easy to produce, and that can be bad, very bad.  Well I guess all I can do is wait and see what happens."

"event","Today I will be going over to Jen's <lj user=""cabernetpixi""> place to get my hair dyed a completely new color.  I personally can't wait, and am really excited, and whenever I am excited I am also restless.  Thus because I am restless I can't sit still for very long, it stinks but I will simply have to live with it today.  

I am not sure of the exact color combo I am going to go with yet, I personally want it to be a darkish red, but not too dark, and subtle black highlights, but there is a problems it seems.  My mother says that if I go with that color combo it will look bad because of the color of my eyebrows, and right now I don't know if she is right or just plain silly at the moment.  Oh well, I will have Jen there when I get the colors and she will be able to give me advise, for she has had her hair dyed, and my mother has not, for she doesn't believe in that for some odd reason, or just doesn't like the idea of having a new hair color, who knows....

Also, about the computer problem from before, I told my mother about it and it seems that instead of being in the right, I am in the wrong, or at least according to the father of one of the suspects I am, and he has my mother on his side now when she originally was not.  I hate it I got a nasty lecture on privacy, when all I was complaining about was that I didn't want that shit on my computer, I swear I might as well keep my mouth shut around them about everything if I am just going to get in trouble. The only other thing I have to say about that is I am soooooo glad I have such good friends as I do, and this thing to vent on and to, other wise I might be going crazy right about now.

Another and last issue to address is the problems between me and my mother from over the vacation.  Friday she followed me to the bus station after seeing that I was completely bummed and depressed that morning, for she wanted to get out of me why I was so down.  Eventually I gave in because it was either that or miss my buss to school.  I told her that I was down about how she snapped and yelled at me over the vacation, about how I have next to no money, and how I missed my friends and especially missed Ian.  Her answers surprised me, she told me that she had only been kidding when she snapped and yelled at me on the trip, and was herself surprised that I took her seriously. (Well news update for her, I have a hard time of telling when someone is serious or not unless they make it extremely obvious, which she had not on the trip.) Then she gave me twenty dollars, even with my protests, and told me not to be scared to use the credit card if I really wanted something. And just before she let me go, she told me to enjoy visiting my friends that night, which I did by the way, even though I was tired I think we had fun.  ^^;;;

Well that is about all I have to say now, and I really hope we are able to pick out a good set of colors for my hair tonight."

"event","Yes, I just got home, yippee, I think, well I am currently out of it, drugged up on pain pills because I seem to get a bellyache on top of a bad headache after air travel.  Thus I am currently drugged up, tired, feeling sick, and not so sure I want to go to school tomorrow....Of course I will go anyway because I have a test. *Sighs sadly* Now, I left off on Sunday around sometime in the morning I think....

Well again the day was not very exciting, minus the fact that me and mom still were not getting along very well, but at that point I was willing to try and deal with out complaint, for we were going to Epcot on the next day, as in all of us, baby included.  That day was pretty good, mom kept her comments to a minimum and I seemed to have a good day, even got several items for myself...and others, just try and guess who....but don't bother guessing what, you won't even come close....

Pretty much that day included us traveling to the different parts of the park, or traveling around the world as they like to say over there. It is a park that has different parts that showcases different places of the world....yada, yada, you know what I am talking about.  Anyway we stopped in the Mexico part of the place, I having already obtained several decent pics along the way, and had lunch, as well as watched as other people had their food stolen by the local wild life, birds mostly, very entertaining let me tell you....Then we ended the trip by visiting the local gift shop and getting gifts for those that could not come with us to FL.

That day ended with no problems, which was nice for a change.  The next day we went out to the last park on the vacation list, Gatorland. Now I know that sounds cheesy, and it is, but the place is more zoo, and wildlife preserve than park.  I like going to those types of places and had a good time. I got a few nice pics of crocs, as well as other animals they had at the park, and even got to hold a albino boa constrictor.  That rocked but mom was not too thrilled about it until she got the pic that was taken, then she calmed down some, only some. Now Aunt Wendi took one look at the pic and her reaction was simply disgust, I knew right away she hated snakes with a passion.

That day ended with mom making dinner and then the two of us getting into a big fight over the packing.  By that time I had given up with making peace on the trip and told her how I felt in a way I knew would get through to her, which made her all the more mad, in the end she walked away mumbling about me sassing her or something, but by that time I didn't care at all, all I wanted was to relax a little.  What I can tell you was that I was very tired, and I don't mean sleep needing tired, I mean bone deep, need another vacation to sleep it off tired, so tired in fact I didn't get any more than an hour of sleep that night...and as a matter of fact that is about all the sleep I have had today....which will make my grammar all the worse....oh well..... The flights were uneventful, and thus here I am....

Oh and one more bit, it seems that someone was on my computer while I was away, they downloaded a music site thing, and I have no clue what type of music they downloaded, for I deleted it completely before I thought about finding out, that I couldn't care so much about, it is what else I found....  They were looking up and downloading porn from some of the sickest and nastiest sites...(I looked in my internet history to find this, and let me tell you whoever it was is one sick human being, and I will go into no more detail about that for it makes me ill thinking about it.....) I have yet to find out what else they have done, but I have done a full computer cleaning for viruses and spy ware, so I am clean there, and I just hope I don't find any unexpected surprises down the road....Thus on top of my being drugged up, tired and so on, I am now completely pissed off which I haven't been in a long time, and I just hope I can sleep that off........

Anyway, yeah I had lots of fun, didn't get to go to Space Mountain though, only went to Epcot, with no rides, Sea World, again no rides (Don't ask, I had my reasons...), and finally Gaterland, and there are no rides there, minus the train which we did ride.  Over all the trip was fun, but extremely stress filled, and I am now ready for a week of rest, which I will not get for about a month....this is where I say I hate life, but I won't for I am happy to be home and in all that is enough for me....Well, it is good to be home, and I look forward to sharing all the pics with my friends...."

"event","Well, where to begin? I guess at the start works right now. So, Thrusday...

The day seemed to start out nicely, we had finished packing the night before, and I couldn't wait to get going. I love to fly by the way, don't know why either, I am scared of heights. We go to the airport about two hours early and just waited, then decided at the last minute to eat something, bad idea.  So because of that we had about fifteen minutes to get to the gate and we still had not gone through secruity. As it turns out I had forgetten to take out a pair of scirssors and that held us up even more.  Thus when we got to the gate, it was ten tell the plane was suppost to leave, and it was gone. Yep, they had closed the gate five minutes before, and we were too late, we had missed our flight.

Well at that point we were in panic, this had never happened before and me and my mom had no idea of what to do. Thank goodness we had a friend with us that knew what to do and had a clear head. So just in time we got another flight that would get us to Portland just in time for our other flight. And from then on we had no problems. What a day, I swear after this trip I won't be going anyplace else in the near future, that is for sure.

We arrived Friday morning, and after a few hours sleep at my Aunt and Uncles place we got up just to relax for the day, and enjoy their company, as well as Colten's, my new Cousin. He is soooooooo cute, I swear, but I still hold to my promise to myself on never having kids of my own!!  So for the most part Friday was a relaxing day, except I didn't get much relaxing done, I had a bad headacke, and a stomace acke on top of that, but that was all gone by that afternoon. As well I have noticed that for some reason my mom doesn't want to make up her mind. One minute she is mad at me and the next we are good friends again, I don't get it, oh well....

Saturday....

Ok, now this day was wonderfull. We went to SEA WORLD!!!! Ok, first we went and watched a Dolfin show which was awsome, I got some good pics of them. Next we wondered around for a while, checking out the shops, had an icecream cone, yahda. Then we went to the sealine and otter show, it was beyond funny. It started out with a pirate mime that escorted people in, or pretened to, in reality he was just there to make people laugh and give those coming in a hard time, and he definitly did his job well.  Then the rest of the show was just as funny, it was about a bunch of pirates that were after treasure, and some of the pirates were sealions, one was an otter, and the last was a walrus(sp). It was a great show. After that we wandered around some more, checked out the shark part, and got some great pictures. Then we went and saw Shamo. That show was short, but awsome, and I got the pleasure of seeing a baby Killer Whale. On top of that I also got to see a 22' and 12000 pound whale, he was huge, and I got an awsome pic of him up on one of the platforms that are out of the water that the whales slide up on, you know so people can see them really good. That was the end of the show as well, but oh well. After that my mom went on the rollercoster in the park, and I got to within half a foot of touching a dolfin, so all in all the day was absolutely wonderfull!!!!

Now we get to today, and not much is going on, my mom left this morning to watch the Nascar 500 with my Uncle, and me and Aunt Wendi are at their place watching the baby. So all in all another relaxing day, and one where I could sneak on to my Uncles computer and type this entry, as well as post a few comments.

All in all though, I still miss everyone, and can't wait to get home....that is after I visit Disney World, I can't leave this place until I go there, sorry guys....."

"event","Alright, today is the day that I leave all my friends, and especially Ian, and go to FL for a whole week. *Cries a new ocean*  

Well not only am I excited, but I am also very drained, and almost don't want to go for reasons stated above.  It seems like I have spent the last month preparing for this week trip, I swear it is soooo hard to get ahead in college work.  Anyway I know it is obvious why I can't wait to go, MY NEW BORN BABY COUSIN!! As well as the parks, but only as an after thought. Both me and my mom can't wait to spoil that cute little baby boy, and when we leave his mom is most likely going to wish we had never come, thats how spoiled he will be. You know from the way I am talking about this baby you most likely would never be able to tell that I REALLY don't want kids, but that is another subject all together.
 
Now lets see, Valentines day was nice, I spent most of the afternoon with Ian, that was definitely enjoyable, but there was something missing, I will let you try and figure out what, for I will not tell... I had gotten Ian this necklace, he loved it, but sadly it is too small for him, so he just wears it around his wrist instead.  I am glad he liked it.

Also that day I had two tests, which sucked for I was not prepared for either and when all was said and done, I felt like I did great, how ironic... Oh well such is life for me it seems.

Ok, what else, I know there was something else on my mind...*Thinks hard* ouch, headache...  Oh forget it, I will just post it when I get back, that is if I remember.... Big<font color=""#ff0000""> if</font> there..."

"event","I guess the title says it all about my life as I see it.  Most things that happen to me now are awesome to say the least, that includes the good and bad stuff, but for the most part my life is boring.  Anyway, enough about that boring stuff.  :P

Ok, I have to confess I don't remember what happened Saturday or Sunday of this last week, it was that boring for me, but everything else I have at least a small idea of what happened.  Last Friday I came home and did homework, oh joy, that seems to be one of the few constants in my life right now....

I guess the only days that hold any excitement were Monday and Thursday.  Monday I was reintroduced to a type of online roleplaying, I was a bit uneasy at first, seeing as the last time I made a complete fool out of myself in a similar place, and nearly crashed it as well so I've heard.  Oops... Anyway, I ended up having lots of fun, and my friends were really good about helping me figure out how to interact without making too much of a fool of myself.  I really like my char for some reason, except that he is soft spoken and almost shy, which I had not intended on but seems to work well with his personality.

Other than that the only other day that had excitement was last night when I went out to a birthday dinner with <lj user=""cabernetpixi""> (Birthday Girl), her little ones, <lj user=""g_crusher"">, my bf Ian, and of course Robert.  That was fun, we went to a local Thai restaurant, ordered up more food than we could eat and just plain enjoyed ourselves.  What a night.  The only downside was that <lj user=""cabernetpixi""> didn't feel completely well.  Well I hope she gets to feeling well soon.  Also she will most likely give more detail on what happened that day. ^^

Now, last but not least in less than a week I will be going down to FL to visit my new born baby cousin, and can't wait!  I am going to have loads of fun with my mom.  As far as I know I will be visiting all of the major places down there like Disney World and so on, you get the idea.  Also my mom purchased tickets to Nascar, I won't be going but that was my choice.  Anyway, that is all I have to tell of."

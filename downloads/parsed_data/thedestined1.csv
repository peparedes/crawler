"event","<p>We had only 1 class debare carried out during EL-MRL week but it was really fun. Through the debate unexpected debators rose up and it became a battle of the sexes (Boys VS Girls) too bad for the girls that we the guys won. OWNAGE! Anyway back to the point, the debate was really fun! Even the notorious boys in class proved to be strong debators (perhaps the constant bickering between themselves improved their debating skills?) and the girls were outalked, outspoken and totally confused. Even the teachers were confused as the boys talked fast and in a confusing manner similar to a beating around the bush manner. Only a few people debated due to the time constraint and shyness of some classmates. One thing for me to say: More Debates! Bring it on!</p>"

"event","<p>Well a most memorable incident that took place in class was the recent Geography debate that we had (I know I am like posting about debates all day long). The propersition topic was : Man must pollute the enviroment in order to develop. I was in the opposition team which means I am presenting the topic: Man&nbsp;need not pollute the enviroment in order to develop. to counter their topic. This debate was extremely important as it concerns our grades for the second term. The winning team of the debate gets 65% (B3) for their grades and the losing team well, gets 60% (B4) for their grades. The best speaker of the debate gets 10% more and the overall best speaker gets an additional 10%. Well my team and the proposition team debated and the atmosphere in the air was filled with excitement and anxiety. Some of the speakers and rebutters were so anxious until they stammered and even speechless at times. It was all very much like the show the Arena. Anyway after the debate was over and the results were announced: The OPPOSITION team won! Woot! My team won yes! The propersition team lost so sad for them. You could clearly see that they were suffering mentally filled with thoughts of How could I lose? or Why? WHY DID WE LOSE? MY MARKS! or something like that. Anyway the debate was really fun and I am fond of debates. And so I'm saying this again: Debates? Bring it on!</p>"

"event","<p>Well the picture of the toilet signboard is kinda of...different? It certainly looks better than the old fasioned stick figures or the male/female symbols and I would definitely like if the old symbols and stick figures to be replaced by the new signboard. Heh hehs. Well its also kinda of artistic and creative not to mention catchy. I think children can spent the whole day looking at the signboard or copying it down on some notebook or something and draw the pictures non-stop. I seriously feel that this is like so unique and ""cool"". hahas this ends my entry.</p>"

"event","<strong><font color=""#cc99ff"">Okay this week there is really no key events unless reading a book counts as a key event. I am going to talk about a new book.&nbsp; Im gonna talk about the book Imperial Traitor which is the last book of the Imperial Series. The books are Imperial Spy, Imperial Assassin and finally the book im talking about. It involves a plot which turns the whole empire of Shandar into turmoil. It involves an assassin named Shalidar who is part of the Guild of Assassins which up to the present cannot be found until Femke who is a Imperial spy partially remembers&nbsp;some old ruins under the palace that may be the headquarters of the Guild. It turns out that she was right and the lord whom she visited the ruins with turns out to be the Head of the Guild. The story has another twist and it turns out he was an undercover spy who was bound by circumstances could not leave the Guild, in the end he died because of power struggle in the Guild which almost cost the demise of it. Shalidar assasinated the Emperor which causes the whole empire into chaos and then manipulates an old lord to try to become the Emperor of Shandar which in turn caused his own death when the Guild was found and the bonding stone - a magical stone which has a lot of energy explodes because a magician who is a friend of Femke destroyed it. The explosion blew up the whole of the west wing of the Palace. I recommend this book to people - it can be bought at Popular. I hereby end this entry, have a good holiday</font></strong>"

"event","<font color=""#993300""><strong>Okay.. Let me start off by saying that there was a new Borders bookshop opened at Parkway Parade mall. One of my aunties recently gave me a giftcard which contain $50 which could be used for buying books and other stuff for my birthday but I had not used it until a few days ago. My parents and I first went to do so errands and then departed for Parkway Parade to have a look at the new Borders. When I reached Borders, there was already a crowd there and it was only 11am. I rushed to the Comics/Manga session and took a look at the wide variety. I went to the Fiction session after that and looked for any good books. I went back to the Manga session and took 2 D.Gray-Man comics and while I actually wanted 2 more, my Dad came and showed me a HUGE book. It was called the heritage of Shannara which contain 4 novels: The Scions of Shannara, The Druid Of Shannara, The Elf Queen of Shannara and The Talismans of Shannara. That book cost $35 and has 1200+pages and my 2 comics cost $17 each but luckily there was a 20% discount storewide. The bill for these 3 things was $56 so I needed to pay only $6 which was out of the budget of the gift card. It took me less than 2 hours to finish my 2 comics and 2 days to finish the Heritage Of Shannara. The Scions of Shannara was about a Druid call Allanon whose shade gave a charge to 3 people to save the world from the Shadowen which were bad and corrupting the world. Par and his brother needed to find the Sword Of&nbsp;Shannara, Wren the Elves of Shannara and Walker to bring back Paranor and become a Druid. Paranor was the place where Druids who once were alive stayed but was cast into an alternate dimension by Allanon and Walker needed to find the Black Elf stone to bring back Paranor but in doing so made himself a Druid. This is just a small fraction of the book but in telling a summary of the book would cost me a few hours so I am ending this entry here.</strong></font>"

"event","<p><font color=""#0000ff""><strong>Ok.. today is 12 Nov but let me write bout wad happen last week.. ahem! Ok last week a key event was the 26hr EOY student council camp. It was a 26hr non-stop camp on&nbsp;last week friday<font color=""#00ffff""><u>(9th Nov)</u></font> in the morning bout 8am-9am the student councillers settled&nbsp;down.&nbsp;There were 78 of us and we had a briefing for the upcoming amazing race that will last&nbsp;from 10am- 4.30pm. We had to go&nbsp;and&nbsp;complete task at 8 of the 10 stops we can choose from. 1st we had a opening game to decide which&nbsp;station we would go 1st. My&nbsp;team G-7&nbsp;won the opening game and choose the 2nd furthest station which was at Istana Park<u><font color=""#00ffff"">(the furthest was at Vivo City but we decided not to go there)</font> We <font color=""#00ffff"">(my team)</font></u> ran out of school and to the bus stop. We juz missed the bus and were a little indecisive whether to run to the interchange or wait for the bus. The indecision almost caused us the headstart we had. We ran to the interchange but halfway to the next bus stop the bus came and we ran to the bus stop at sports hall. We managed to catch the bus but wasted our energy for nothing. To our suprise, another team was already on the bus. My team was a little disheartened but nevertheless we did not give up. Once we reach the tampines bus interchange, the 2 teams rushed to the MRT station. The other team was ahead of us but it was no use as the train would ocme in another 6min. Team G-7<font color=""#00ffff""><u>(my team)</u></font> basically strolled from the interchange to the MRT station. After the 6min wait we hopped on the train and waited for about 45min till we reach dhoby gaut MRT station <font color=""#00ffff""><u>(we obviously changed trains)</u><font color=""#0000ff"">.</font></font> We rushed to the Istana Park and did the activity which was memorising how to build a model and build it. <u><font color=""#00ffff"">(</font><font color=""#00ffff"">oh yea the station masters and team leaders were from St Andrews JC, i forgot to mention that</font></u> <font color=""#ff0000"">:</font><font color=""#ff0000"">P</font><font color=""#00ffff""><u>)</u> </font>We took about 30min to complete the activity. After that, we had to do an activity which was kinda of gross, we had to take a strand of uncooked spaghetti and then two people would have to put that 1 strand between their mouths and walk either sideways or backwards together 1 round around a pond. We completed it and then rushed to plaza singapura via the underpass and had to find a guy somewhere in that huge mall. The only clue is that he is in the odd levels eg B1, 1, 3, 5. We decided to go B1 1st but did not find him. Alas, the curiousity of the girls got better of them and decided to check&nbsp;inside McDonald's and found him. The search therfore only took 5min. LOL! We took our 30min lunch at Mc and continued to Citilink. We had to count how many crocs shoes there were while doing some kind of trail. It took us 2 trys and there were 48 crocs shoes there. We then rushed to the MRT and took a train to Bugis MRT and had to search for various words on products everywhere in Bugis Junction. After that we took the MRT to Changi Airport MRT. It took us about 1h. We then had to take 3 photos with 3 different types of foreigners and completed that in 5min. Then we had to do a puzzle and completed it in 1min and had to do a skit which took 30MINS! Later we had to do an activity which involve us who had to ""tie"" our hands together and somehow manage to stand up with a ball without using our hands and then walk around. After we completed all these stations we took the bus 27 and rode from Changi Airport to somewhere near our school in Tampines. We reached our school 1st and were the champions of the amazing race! WOOT! We then got a hamper which had 1 cylinder of Pringles chips, 2 boxes of Ferrior Roche<font color=""#00ffff""><u>(sorry I don't know how to spell)</u></font> and some other goodies. We later had some meetings with out sub council heads and vice heads for next year stuff and then ate our dinner and supper and watch a show named Man <font color=""#00ffff""><u>(or Men)</u></font> of Honour and had more meetings and we will scolded and then we had breakfast and went home half sleeping. For me, it was hard to cope with the camp as i was sick and later i went to a doctor and got 4 medcines which cost me a bomb but that is another story. So here I am writing this super long entry hands trembling because of the strong medicine and am giddy.&nbsp;So this is the end of entry 1 of 5 of USSW EOY Holiday assignment. Signing off!&nbsp;<br /><font color=""#ffffff"">&nbsp;&nbsp; ( V )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ( &nbsp;. .)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~ RABBIT! zzz<br />C( "")( "")</font></strong></font></p>"

"event","<p><strong><font color=""#0000ff""><font color=""#ffffff"">I went to Joshua's house with Zulkarnain to do project work. We spent 20 hours altogether spanning for 3 days. 4 hours on Friday(the week before),8 hours on Monday and anoher 8 hours on Tuesday. We took long to finish as the girls did not help but it wasn't entirely their fault as I had assigned them to do the designing and painting of the project when it is completed.( our project was a kind of special multi purpose box, no point in telling the rest as this is my group's secret. ) Anyway when we had completed it on Monday, the girls were not free as they got band CCA and tuition balh blah blah.(can't they sacrifice their time for a day to do the project?) So&nbsp;we boys had to do the painting. I thought of the colour coordination while Josh and Zul took turns to spraypaint the box. Anyway I got really pissed off with the girls in my team and said I would give them a 0 -&nbsp;ZERO - Ji Dan, because they did not help out or even tried to ask their CCA teachers or tuition teacher to let them off a little earlier and go to Josh's house to paint and design, not even for an hour. But on Wednesday, the day we would suppose to present our project, we discovered that our PW teacher postponed it. I almost burst a blood vessel with frustration. All that 20 hours of rush and inability to do homework and revision were wasted and the whole world came crashing down ( so called). I picked myself up agaain and gave the girls to do another task to prevent them from getting a zero: do the survey and survey results and the powerpoint. Then on another day, the girls ganged up and told me that I did not do anything blah blah blah and I unleashed my fury.. okays not fury but anger and frustration. We had a heated debate that spanned 5min in non-stop rapid fire word exchange with me mostly firing the words if you get my drift. My mood for that day was spoiled and I was angry with everyone for no particular reason and got bored with the lessons. (pardon me for my honesty) Moral of this highlight is: when you are doing project work you better sacrifice your time or you face the consquences especially when you are in my PW team. And for my female PW group members, you better do a good job or else...&nbsp;Dont play play with me... seriously.<br />Zachary&nbsp;signing off.</font><br /></font></strong></p>"

"event","<strong><font color=""#ff0000"">The most beutiful thing in the world to me is the whole universe. The universe is a thing that is made up of many galaxies including ours, the Mily Way. The Milky Way consists of the solar system: The Sun, Mecury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.&nbsp;The Earth consists of 194 countries of which Singapore is one of them. Singapore consists of 4 main parts: North, South, East and West. East consists of Pasir Ris, Tampines, Simei blah blah blah. Tampines consists of many streets, avenues, schools, buildings&nbsp;and malls. So anyway the universe is God's creation and is made up of many things so therefore it is the most beautiful thing in thw world which contains the other things which God has created.

"event","So, I've been meaning to write in here cause you know I want people to know my personal life and comment on it... what else is livejournal for beside sharing pictures, which I absolutely love looking at them when I'm bored. But just lately, I've been real blue. yea blue as in sad, depressed, whatever you want to call it, just blue. I got so much on my shoulders, some of which shouldn't be but it is. School... transfering, classes, videos, dealing with other people's schedules, doing favors for other people, making sure I actually do a good job in the short time I have. I really think this was one of the shittiest academic years I have had to date. I don't know what happened, I procrasinated I guess... things happen at the wrong time. Other things besides school get in the way, having to deal with a daily source of pain everyday because of the last year. I feel like I should regret, or move on, try, just something... but all I can do is to lay around and think, what am I going to do next? What's right for me? what do I want to do? How do I get things back to the way they were? How do I get things to be the way I want them to be? And consistently answering my mom's question so what are you doing for next year?I'm just plain ole not happy. Not happy with anything in my life. I think out of all my friends, I got the worst off cause I just didn't know what I wanted to do and I'm suffering from being so indecisive or not acting on anything. There are things I do want to do now, I have plans, I have ideas, but I'm just afraid to put them in action because of the things I am going to lose, the things I may have to face, and just what if I fail and I go back to where I am now, just worse off? I don't know if I ready to make another change in my life when the last time I made a change in my life it lead me to here.

ok, so I imagine if you read this, you probably thinking, there she goes again another wah wah story that her life isn't great, she isn't happy wah wah grow up. Alright, fair enough, but Ill tell you anybody that is saying I'm way too emo and way too depressed and I need help... just look around you. I know a handful of kids that have had panic attacks cause of stress and stress alone... life is hard, especially when you're not the richest kid, your family isn't around to help, the people you count on aren't there, the things that made life easy aren't around anymore. It's just you, facing all the mistakes you make and having to weave in and out of them. I just don't want to screw up."

"event","I feel as though if I saved the world and 100 million children and was a living angel on earth... I would still get yelled at people I think that are so important. To them, I never do anything right and therefore should be reminded consistently that I suck. period, I suck. That's sad that I've never intentionally hurt people but somehow I fuck up so bad that people feel the need to make me feel like utter shit and stupid for the actions I have done. Well you're right, I have fucked up, but yelling at me doesn't make things better just like me crying about it. So stop your bitching and I'll stop my crying.

I could save the world and that would make no difference to you. I could save your life and you would make me feel like I'm the worst person alive... and I take it cause I care for people too much. too much."

Oh how I hate waiting on another person. I think that's why I eat alone sometimes, people talk too much and I'm usually in a hurry. Or maybe I think it's annoying when another person talks when I'm thinking. I don't like those people that come up to you while you eat and ask you how you are doing and preced to sit there for a while when it's obvious you were doing something else... like reading.. or chewing your food. I don't know. I think that might have a personal attack on someone.

wow they have an autosaved draft now? holy crap they needed that like a couple years ago when all you read was ""so I wrote this entry... but I lost it cause I pressed the update button and it took too long cause there was 50 million people on this site.""

mmmm... waiting sucks.

so I emailed one of my professors the other day, haven't heard back from him... that's not supposed to happen, especially when you go to a school with less than 10,000 people ever on the campus. Does this give me the privilege of not doing one of his labs until I'm ready to respond? I think so.

I worked on this video on my computer cause supposedly it has all this great software to make videos and cds and watch tv on it... and when I go to burn it onto a DVD, yea it turns out it only works with that program, and only the windows media player can play it... hm, suck it? 

waiting is a torture no one should have to endure. way to go our fast paced society that's only getting faster and crazier with each moment. yea suck it."

"event","alright so here's the deal

I'm heading up back to asheville, like I have done so many times before, but actually not excited to go back cause I know this semester is going to blow. it's like everytime I come back I'm saying to asheville ""oh, really, is that all you got for me? well I'm coming back for more of your crap... bring it."" I honestly feel that way. Just in general, my life sucks. so for all those people that wanted to see karma come bite me in the butt, well here's your time to laugh in my face. Ok, back to what I was saying, I was driving back to asheville and I'm on the last leg of the trip, I-40 near Morganton, when I get pulled over by a cop. I thought the cop had to get through for some emergency so I moved over cause the car behind me did the same thing... no, the cop gets behind me. I can't believe it. and I didn't cry until he went back to his car... which was kinda dumb but I just thought of how I left my parents earlier that day crying and missing them, and now I did something they told me not to. I felt terrible, like downright terrible. I got pulled over last year doing about the same... 9 miles off. 80 vs 89 in a 65. I sure know how to mess up. It just made my trip back to asheville even worse, like I almost wanted to turn around and say screw school/asheville. yea laugh it up.

but as soon as I got back I was greeted by people I missed and ate a piece of crab, which was interesting- why are the ""best"" foods always an acquired taste? We drank and played card games, it was really fun... but I stuck out as usual in the worst way. oh well, that's me...

came back to an empty room, I don't think I have a roommate but I could be wrong and they could show up anyday now... but for right now I'm in an empty room... with stephanie and ramsey as my suitemates. Which I have a funny story for that... I'm not going to say which one it happened to, but I came back from hanging out with virginia and all those girls and guys... we leave our door unlocked most of the time so we just walk right in, and I did that to the surprise of two people having sex on the couch. yea well I didn't continue into the room instead I just said sorry and closed the door and went on my way. hahaha yea so that was interesting. the weird part was they still had their shirts on but no pants... that has to be awkward. haha hey, it happens especially in the dorms. 

yea, so someone save me from asheville cause I already skipped a class cause I had the wrong numbers written down, gah I need to double check next time."

I don't mean shit to you. we can't be friends until you grow up and change and realize you had something in your life that comes around only a couple of times and you had the fucking nerve to throw it away. pay me what you owe and move on. fuck you and your ways. you are the shittiest person I have ever met in my life and I hope that one day you get what you deserve. meanwhile, enjoy her company cause that's all you'll be getting, all her love notes. cause this is the last time I will believe anything you have to say to me. good bye."

I woke up today with the worst feeling in the world like ""what am I doing here? I want to go. I don't want to see anyone anymore and I would be fine with that"" sometimes it's better to be alone thn with people and right now in my life that's all I want to happen. I don't want attachments. I'm absolutely afraid of it. It's hard getting close to people and then having to let go or deal with the ups and downs with just drama and all that other crap. I think people know what I mean. like I find it hard for me to have a best friend, I'm just too damn independent or weird or not fun for anyone to want me as a best friend. maybe it's for the best cause I can leave without a trace and no one would have to fret."

"event","yea I had tons and tons of fun with Aimee today... sweating out on the park hills with the billion crawling-all-over-your-body gnats and ants. gahh. We took a lot of pictures of us goofing off and making funny faces and we learned aimee has the most AWESOME camera ever! holy crap she can do this split thing where you take one half of the picture then the other half. We did everything imaginable with that, like split faces, split cars, and did this funny inside the car stuff. Where I would be sitting in the front two seats of the car and she would be sitting in the back... then vice versa, or both of us in the back both times. they turned out really neat. But halfway through our photo bonanza, it started to rain... rain hard. It was so bad it started to hail where we were. Thankfully we were alreaduy in the car talking when it happened. But seriously it was right over us the entire time, the lightening and everything. I'm amazed we even made it out of the park today. But yea, the highlight of out park trip was this: we played with two little black girls. Ok, one was sweet and wasn't really bothering us too much, but the youngest one, gahhh I didn't like her. She came over where we were and sat in one of our swings and was like ""can you push me?"" of course, being a good person, I was like ""yea sure, how high?"" and I pushed her and pushed her and she was like ""I want to stop... twist me!"" still being good, ""yea no problem, all the way?"" twisted her so tightly in that swing and aimee did ht same for the other girl cause by then she was there too. We did this for about like 15 minutes I would say... and we finally got to play around on the swings ourselves, then here comes the little black girl again. ""can you twist me?"" ""yea sure, all the way again?"" did it again and again. I honestly, had no problem with pushing her on the swing and twisting her and her sister up on them too cause I always like to see people happy and have fun, especially if I am too... however it got to the point where this girl was seriously too much. I was sitting down on the swings talking to aimee when I hear ""can you help me?"" ""yea, do you want a push, twist again?"" ""no, can you help me clean off my shoe, I have dirt in it"" ""umm... ok, here you go."" ""can you clean my feet too?"" ""yeaaaa.. where at?"" ""no, you got to go get water on your hands over there and clean them off."" -blank stare- ""um, ok"" ""do you need me to show you how to work that fountain"" ""no I got it"" ::clean her feet off:: ""can you clean my shoe too? but don't get it wet I just got them and they're new."" ""uhhh, um ok."" -wtf- ""can you put them on my feet too? oh wait the other shoe is dirty too, can you get the dirt out from them?"" 'hurry up, whatever-little-girls-name, we have to leave' ""oh can you hurry up too, I have to leave now"" ::puts shoe back onto little gils feet:: ""bye!"" alright, did I just get pwned by a little black girl? I seriously walked around saying, what a brat. I can't believe I just did that. I became that little girls servant for five minutes. gahhh. oh well, the day couldn't get any worse, can it? why not."

"event","I rarely write in this thing anymore, let alone keep up with people changing their names or deleting shit. Livejournal just doesn't hold it for me anymore... It's more like a place to put up pictures of what I did that day or the funny faces I can make. or a place to put up my rants and call people out on things. I honestly don't use this as a diary. My diary is more of a drawing book. I draw what I feel, what I see in my mind, or just whatever fancies me. And Livejournal is not really the right medium for that. It's not exactly the right medium for anything. I look back on some entries and I've seen me go back and forth on ideas, people, and just drama shit. gah drama. I'm done with that, if you honestly want to bring drama in my life, I will hurt you. physically. or at least verbally. mother fucking cunt. haha. best cuss words ever put together. I don't give a shit, or a flying fuck. let's count the many cuss words I've used in this post... they're not out of anger, but just something to say. yeaaaa.

so has anyone ever played out a scenario in your mind? like what if I met this one guy, what would I say... or if I saw that bitch of a girl, what would I say to make her look like a complete and utter idiot. oh, yea I have. or if I met a boy that rejected me and like I became this hot girl that you realized he lost a good thing. yea, I know a good handful of you out there have. In all earnest, my favorite is the bitch girl. like I think of cut downs such as ""You want to know what, you treat your friends like tissues, when you're done using them you throw them away. that's why no one likes you and you have no real friends."" yea I like that one. haha or ""you're so ugly your parents would have to put you on flyers that said 'have you seen this dog?' if you ever got lost"" gah lamest cut downs ever, but I'm sure if you heard someone actually say them, you would laugh. or the best ever ""No one likes you, go away."" Now I would use that one, that never fails. Unless they stick around, then you just have to walk away cause who would want to talk to them?

But honestly, I'm not about confronting people. I'm the least confrontational person ever. Unless you really tick me off. I think only one, ok maybe two, people have ever done that to me. And I'm talking, I did not go near them for hours cause I was afraid of what I might do to them. for real, I wanted to punch one of them really hard in the face blood and everything, but now I just laugh at them. I like laughing at them better. It suits.

So I'm going to write some more before I quit. Listening to Starting Line... my favorite song on there is ""stay where I can see you"" I feel that could be an anthem for my life. but you know what, in that song it says ""I could name all 50 states, but 48 get in the way from me being next to you"" or something like that. that's not accurate. there's only 48 states in the mainland US. so it's more like 46. gahh. ok I getting bit by a mosquito and I'm done thinking of the dumbest things to talk about. good night."

yea, so I woke up this morning because quite frankly I was afraid to go back to bed and start dreaming again. yea for real. Ok, my dream: It was set in a hotel room from some reason, it was the morning, we were all getting up and getting ready to head out for breakfast or school, something... we were just getting up. I look over and I see that I'm sharing the bed with Ryan and Laura (I don't know if I'll get in trouble for saying that or not, but you guys were there, not sure why maybe cause I roomed with Laura for a semester) they're facing the right way and I'm at the end of the bed facing the opposite way, so it wasn't like we were all huddled together. Then, out of the blue, ""my boyfriend"" shows up... yea 50 Cent. WTF. It scared me to death... it wasn't like aw, that's cute. It was like ewwwww, big black muscly man. He was all up on me like ""hey baby, I just got back from working out, look how big my muscles are... I want to cuddle with you, hey girrrrl, ::kisses::"" Ok, I'm semi awake while my mind is thinking up this bizarre scenario and it's freaking me out. He leaves to get a massage or see someone or work out some more. I turn to Laura and all like ""omg, wtf. I need to get out of here, why on earth did he come from? ahhh I need to get up and leave right now before he comes back to snuggle on me some more"" So then I woke up. Absolutely the weirdest dream I've had in days. Who in their right mind dreams about 50 cent... and futhermore as their boyfriend? I'm sorry 50 Cent, you are not fine, you in fact are disgusting and I don't want to love up on your muscles or even dream about it."

I remember in second grade, we were all given a disposable camera to go around and take pictures. Out of all the photos we took, we would chose one that we thought was the prettiest of them all. I went around town taking a pictures, one I remember out of all of them was a pawn shop. yea, a pawn shop. On top of the roof, there was this great big diamond made of flashy paper or plastic-something to make it look sparkle in the sun. However, that pictured turned out bad and I thought that would be my ""winning"" picture. My last resort, well it really wasn't my last resort-it was a picture I wanted to keep for myself- was a picture of my dog sparky. He looked so pretty to me I really thought I was going to win. but yea, I didn't and I don't have that picture, I don't think...

This dog, precious as he may be, moves sooo much. The only reason I got him to sit so pretty was because he was distracted by my mom moving in the kitchen... I'm sure in these pictures he's thinking 'I want me some food!!!'

It rained so hard today, goodness!

My power even went out for like 3 hours-I was so mad and frustrated... not sure why maybe cause there was nothing to do. Well, take pictures of course."

another unrelated point I want to make is, don't fuck around with your opinions and feelings. Be direct, be forward, never hide behind double meanings or fake smiles. Only cowards find comfort in ""being nice"". Don't drop hints thinking that is a polite way of indicating how you feel. How many times do people not understand, so why do that? You're immature and a fool if you do. Do the right thing and be direct and not afraid to say what's on your mind. gah."

"event","ok, I've come to a conclusion: Love can not be gained or earned... you can only feel or experience it. I had a whole speech with it, but I can't remember it. but yea, I think you will experience true love by loving someone as though you have never been hurt and keeping an open heart. Also, whatever you are looking for-either it be true love or just pure sin- you'll find it. It's out there... one thing that the majority of the world's population has in common is the want to be loved.

has this happen to anyone else lately or maybe in the past couple of months... you'll just be sitting there, nothing really too bad but nothing too good... and you just get this feeling like ""you need to get up and just run away...now! go! just go explore, forget all your ties with people, just go out in the world by yourself and just experience anything that comes your way. it will be good for you. forget everything"" then go back to being ok, I have this to do and that to do... I think I might be alone on that one. I don't think I have the courage to just get up and run away, although I thought I could the other day... I might be tempted to go somewhere and never return back to charlotte. haha who knows, I'm crazy."

"event","I really don't know what to say... at all. You know all those times you say ""this isn't bad... things can always get worse."" ok, one if you're dumb enough to say that in the first place, you just jinxed yourself. two, they always get worse after that! fuck that. fuck my whole life right now, and fuck happy people-how the hell can people be so happy all the time. my world is crumbling before my eyes and I feel like shit.. and thy're siting there going ""girl, you need to loosened up, enjoy yourself-live in the moment and stop worrying!"" I think that's a conspiracy to take my mind off the fact that some people just want to screw me over and any moment of relaxation is a moment of waiting death... yea and you know what, I'll feel a lot better just if people actually told the truth for once and not try to bullshit me. I'm won't lie to you, so why the fuck would you to me? it's going to make it a lot worse if you lie. things only get worse by lying."

Ok, this is just another reminder, I have three unopened packages of ortho-tri lo, if you use it, want to use it, or just want to marvel at it... leave me a message. Now it doesn't come cheap, but it's cheaper than going to the pharmacy and all that hoo-ah... My price is around the 7 dollar range, if you contact me on aim-we can figure something out and all that jazz. I would love for someone to have them because they're just going to waste with me.</lj-cut>

oh yea, my birthday is in about 17 days! not that anyone really cares... it's ok."

-ran into Brett, talked it up for a bit, went out to eat at Subway, where two girls in front of us were not paying attention to the flow of the line and was up by the register waiting to place their order... then got mad at the guy for ignoring them (when they were in the wrong place of the line).. they go fine whatever no we don't any food... run across the street holding hands to the mcdonalds. classic. then come back and sit in front of subway? they ended driving off with no food. idiots.
-went to Goodys, got three cute skirts for under 20 dollars. heck yea.
-met up with cayce at carmike, see star wars III... not too impressed with the dialogue at all, action sequences were pretty good... as far as the last star wars, not all that it was crazked up to be, kinda a let down.
-went to elk mountain, hung out up there, just listening to music
-made a run to wendys and ordered a bunch of food... so good. oh yea! had a NuGrape, haven't had one in forever... it was so damn good.

I have three unopened packages of ortho tri-cyclen lo...

"event","The past two days have been... whoa. My favorite this morning was Maddie peering out of her room to me waking up and saying ""Hi nicky... I thought was you, but I imed Rachael this morning and was like 'oh my gosh, who's that strange girl on the couch?!"" haha I had a lot fun the night before though... I haven't had my heart pumping that much in a long time... and I haven't been that adventrous in quite some time. I seriously want to do more things like that.  I don't really like to write out everything I did, cause a)takes a long time on my part b)takes a long time for other people to read c)who is really going to spend the time to read it... seriously.

He asked us ""ladies where are you supposed to be?"" -we're vistors ::points to vistor sticker:: ""you're what? vistors you don't need to be barging in people's classes. you need to go somewhere else"" -we're just looking through the window, we're not going to interrupt them- ""well ok, did you check in with the office fine?"" ::points to sticker again:: -yup- what an asshole.

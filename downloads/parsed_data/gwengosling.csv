"event","I'm really butchering today.  Haha!  I mean I was sort of on it during Institute class - joking and laughing and having fun.  Then I just started going a little bit beyond myself.  Now I feel foolish and like I am just thinking in nonsensical terms.  I also feel like I'm talking too much today.  Suddenly.  But really what I want to do is dance and sing.  I've been trying for weeks now to find good musical theatre audition repertoire - or just repertoire that is good for me.  Now I have some ideas, but it's going to be difficult - like detective work - trying to track down sheet music.  Then I'll have to make copies somehow, put them in my music binder in the prescribed way... and then learn them with my non-existent piano and then make them actually good by acting them.  SO much work, and I start to wonder if the pieces I'm thinking about will even be any good.  But really I need to stop questioning myself and just have a little confidence and assert myself in the music.  So that's what I'm going to do, but first I really need to find the sheet music.  :)  Apart from that I have a paper due on Tuesday that I'm having trouble with.  And I have two plays I need to read for one class.  And on top of that I'm going to start voice lessons... but I woke my teacher up from a nap when I tried to call her just now - good first impressions, eh?  Finally I'm eating very poorly, I have three paper cuts, 5 purple bruises and a dime-sized 2nd degree burn on my forehead.  I need to sleep probably and I'm really tired.  Just thought you'd like to know.

"event","I totally saw George Lucas today.  How crazy!  It was the homecoming game on USC's 125th anniversary.  Being here is so surreal.  Anyways - I got a wicked bad sunburn at the game today, but we won, so that's sweet.  Now I'm hangin with a couple girl friends and we're having my roommate call guys to invite them over to watch a movie.  She's pretending that she knows all these people who have no idea who she is... so that's pretty cool.  That is all.

"event","Yay for snow. It started snowing at about 6am on Sunday morning and didn't stop till about 6 or 7pm. It hasn't snowed since then, but it is ball-ripping cold out. Right now my weatherbug is blowin' up and saying that its 5 degrees out, which is fucking nuts. Its so cold that the condensation on the inside of our room window is frozen. Like, there is about a half an inch of ice on the fucking window, and I don't think its going anywhere for a while.

But yay for four day weekends. I work up at 10:30 on Friday for an interview with Duquesne's CTS. Basically they're the AV nerds. I think that I might have gotten the job. I really should have called later on Friday (like CTS suggested that I do), but I got too wrapped up in stuff. And because all the offices were closed for the weekend and on Monday, I have to check tomorrow after my shitty day of classes, which lasts from 9:25am till 4pm. Not Cool. Friday night a bunch of us went over to Tim's (aka Timestep) house in the South Side to party. He had picked up a p-ball and a 45 ""Pre-Game"" pack of Molsen, which we didn't kill till last night (more on that later). It was a bunch of music majors (me, Erin, Jeff, Andy Barnes, John Field, Toad, and Andy Deel<--polysci) and a bunch of Tim's other friends. Everybody except for Erin and I rolled out at around 3, but then we rolled out at around 4 and got back to campus at 5. good times. Saturday I don't remember what the fuck we did. Last night I rolled down to the hooka bar at about 12 after watching a movie with Erin. It was freezing out. By the time I got there, I couldn't feel my legs. I got there to find Timestep,  Jeff, Toad, Barnes, and D-Rock chilling with a couple hookas and about 30 Molsens. We rolled out at around , gave the rest of the beer to the people at the hooka bar, and then went to Tom's Diner (rock). I knocked over my cup of Mountain Dew and felt like an ass. The thing is, I was one of two sober people at the table. We left and then ran into some people from the dorm. Then we had the pleasure of walking of the icey-ass death stairs (if you've visted me, then you know what they are...except for sean). We got back, and then I crashed. Today we pretty much played 007 on PS2 all day. We also went down to the South Side so I could get a barbell for my ear and then we wen to the exchange. I picked up a few NES games and a controller. We headed back and then played more 007, ordered chinese, and watched jay and silent bob. 

Time for a brother to roll out because I plan on waking up early to practice for my lesson, which I'm totally not prepared for."

"event","Where to begin..,
First, I finally have the internet in my room. Now I have another excuse to not go outside.

Lets see, I've been home for about a week and have still managed to get absolutely nothing done. I needed a job. I had plans to get a job. The plans either fell through or I didn't follow them through. The movie theater can especially eat my ass. I put in 6 months there, busted my ass, didn't get my fucking quarter raise, and was one of the few people who actually did work. Now I don't like to gloat and shit, but I was a good fucking worker. I went out of my way to do work, and never did any of it half-assed. I cleaned up puke for christ's sake. The point of this little rant is that they wouldn't take me back for holiday help, but they took back a shit load of other people. I need money real bad, and a brotha' can only sell so much of his Concerta.

Anyways, I've been out every single night for the past week. It was very enjoyable, but I'm fucking beat to hell. Heres a little list of what has happend (this isn't in any order):
- Got high
- Drove around
- Went to sonar a couple times
- slept in till 2pm for about 4 straight days
- recorded my shit for ""Keeping Ska Dead""
- from Thursday night to Friday, we didnt stop drinking till about 6am. I was still drunk when I woke up at 10:30am on Friday.
Thats pretty much it.

Yesterday I went to Erin's house (the girl from River Hill that also goes to Duquesne). We chilled and watched a movie and then I ate dinner with her and her rents. It was good times. After that, I went to Sonar with Ems, Annie, Matt Miller, and a couple other people. There was no cover charge but the bouncer still had to check IDs. When he looked at mine, he didn't believe that I was 18. He then gave me a drink bracelet and told me to ""not go overboard"" because I was supposed to be DD. Ems then decided to let me get trashed and she would be DD. She gave me a few bucks for beer (best sister ever) and then Matt bought carbombs for me, him, and annie. Then the akwardness happened, and I'll just leave it at that.

Today I went to BPS to visit Eddie and basically dicked around for about 2 hours at the reel counter. It was fun times. 

Yeah, thats it."

Its going to be so good to come home. I'll finally have a chance to relax and clear my head from all the bullshit that has happened in the past three months. Being up here definately gave me this empty feeling. I guess the fact that all the people i've ever known and cared about are 250 miles awy was really rough on me. There was a period of time about a month and a half ago when i was just constantly depressed. I didn't have any motivation and nothing felt like it mattered anymore. I pretty much got over that shit and the break should help me recover that last bit and get back onto a normal sleep schedule (for the past week I have been going to sleep at 4 am at the earliest). But like I said before, the break is going to be amazing.

Anyways, here is a schedule of events for the break:
-Record the rest of the CD
-Record with Dingus
-Possibly play a new years type show
-Go to some shows
-Play some church gigs because i'm too lazy to get a real job
-get fucked up

I have the worst habbit of putting everything off until the last minute. I can just never seem to get anything started. Let me run through the list of shit i gotta do because I'm an asshole that procrastinates like nobody's business:
1) 5 audio logs by Thursday
2) A sequencing project with at least 5 tracks and at least 32 measures by monday/
3) A 7 page paper by the 14th
4) Write a composition for the 13th
5) Write ANOTHER compostion with Jeff and Mark for the 13th
6) Practice my ass off for my trumpet jury on the 13th

Finals are:
1) Intro to audio on thursday night, written and profficiancy. Both of which will kick me in the ass.
2) Eurythmics on either thursday or friday
3) musicianship on thursday or friday

The good thing is that we have no classes on Wednesday, which means i'm gonna get fucked up tomorrow night like its my fucking job. I then plan on waking up and doing work all fucking day on wednesday.

Again, I pray that I make it through the next week alive. If I do, I'm buying myself a present.


oh yeah, i'm also going to make an attempt to quit smoking after this semester."

...But just like the last time they came up or when I went home, I'm left in my empty-ass dorm room feeling rediculously homesick. A couple days after I came back from Columbia, I more or less had a nervous breakdown because the homesickness hit like a ton of bricks. Its the whole realization that everyone I love is 250 miles away. Its such a fucking downer. This place really is going to turn me into a wreck. I'm so affraid of going back home at the end of this year and just being a completely different person. Ugh, i just feel so fucking bitter and lonely up here. I'll be coming home on Friday and staying till the 29th, so hopefully that should help me out a bit.

I am so pumped about coming home. I get to see my sister, play a show with the coolest group of guys ever, and hang out with the old crew. its gonna be fucking awsome.

yeah, thats it"

"event","i find the girl, i be a gentleman, a couple of my ""friends"" (and i use the term lightly) show up, and then everything goes down the shitter. different scenario from last week, but just as annoying.

Friday nights hate me.

Big thanks to Jeff, Andrew, D-Rock, Mike and Mike for listening to me bitch about my petty girl problems. What can I say, i'm really an emo kid. Time to go listen to some Dashboard and cry like a little bitch.

Tomorrow night:
Chillin with T.D.C. and Luu and then...

PARTY BALL! - 660 ounces of beer...IN A PLASTIC BALL!!




Ed, I got your back when ever and where ever. You're mah boi."

"event","last night fucking sucked. i went with a big group of people went to a frat party at CMU, and by big group means 20 girls and 5 guys, so one would think with that i'd have no problem getting into the party given the girl to guy ratio. we didnt get in. that and all the girls pretty much ditched us right then. we (the guys that didn't get in) wandered around dithridge to find a party but there was nothing. we ended up going to The O , and three of the girls decided not to be bitches and met up with us there. then we went to a party on Atwood. i basically paid $5 for some really shitty beer. like it was so shitty that i couldnt finish 2 cups. 

we got back to campus and i hung out with my friend metal-head jeff which is always good fun."

"event","In the past 2 days i got probably about 8 hours of sleep. Tuesday I couldn't get to sleep till about 5:30 AM and last night I was up till 3:45 doing audio logs that I had put off, and I still have one more to do before I turn them in tonight. I also have to do a couple more pages for my english paper rough draft to bring to class, so i'm gonna get on that in a hot minute. I did well on both musicianship tests and I still have to study for my Intro to Audio midterm that is tonight. I also have a splitting headache. I had a 9:50 class this morning that ended up getting cancelled, and by that time I already had a pepsi and my meds so there was no way in hell that I could get back to sleep. Tomorrow at noon I have my make-up skills hearing that i'm STILL not prepared for, which means its gonna be an early start for Jeremy.
   The day is starting to look up, though. I found a dollar on the ground and I got a package from home that is filled with boxes of fruit snacks and nutra-grain bars. I'm just waiting for this day to end, its gonna be a bitch."

"event","Bluffstock was alright. I think we frightened some people away with killer horn riffs and Bush bashing. Other than the hardly-responsive crowd, it was pretty rockin'. Big props to Gordan for playing trombone for us tonight.

Cameran from the Real World is an idiot for the following reasons (these events happened in this order, mind you):
1) We gave her one of our ghost t-shirts to wear while introducing us. She didn't understand this concept at all. It finally got through her self-absorbed head after 5 of the volunteres explained it to her.
2) She didn't know how to say our band name
3) She thought the trombone was a saxaphone.

I did ask her to go out with me and she said yes. It was some funny shit.

And C.T. was totally on the ball with the Ghostbusters referance."

"event","hey, I'm organizing a student rally in support of the teachers (possibly, operation government open your f*cking eyes)..haha.. .I really need collaborative help from everyone. Next wednesday at 2 pm probably, we'll meet at Garibaldi and 'march' to our MLA's office in town. I need you guys to get the word out! From all schools in maple ridge, we need to support our teachers...cyndy has done so much for all of us, and we need to go to the MLA's office and demand that he/she support the teachers. 

Im trying to make this happen in all districts in the lower mainland. I was thinking perhaps a live band in a pick up driving slowly infront of us would be cool! I can't do this one alone, I need you guys to step it up and get the word out. I was thinking to hand out jobs for each of you to do, for example, some one could round up the drama kids, someone music, sports, gr 12's, 11s, 10s, 9s, 8s, etc. 

WE can make this happen. I'm writing a letter to the paper to see if we could get their support by publishing it and taking pictures and stuff. So give me a call or send me an email.

peace out team, 
tash"

People are distancing, I can tell, thanks guys.

Bad sleeping habits are beginning their horrible cycle again.

I spend too much money, my fault entirely, but still shitty.

I need a job, but I'm not really a worker.

I want to travel this summer, somewhere, fuck, I want to go back to Europe, with friends.

It is painfully unfair that I'm only 17.

<P><STRONG>January</STRONG>- cannot remember.</P>
<P><STRONG>February</STRONG>- turned 16 </P>
<P>-2nd semester grade 11, started Biology, French, Acting, and Student aid.</P>
<P>-Biology&nbsp;was shit **Ms.Bohn is a nazi-biblethumping bitch</P>
<P>-French was more shit **Ms.Richardson (not the nice video/drama teacher, a different dumb one) hated me, probably because I skipped ever 3rd class</P>
<P>-Acting was awesome of course</P>
<P>-I student aided a grade 10 drama class, it was tres cool, and now I'm friends with pretty much all the kids.</P>
<P><STRONG>March- </STRONG>auditioned for ""The Miser"" and had much fun getting the part&nbsp;of one saucy&nbsp;cougar Frosine.</P>
<P>-sooo much work doing&nbsp;Miser</P>
<P><STRONG>April</STRONG>- hmm...not a big month, can't remember anything big.</P>
<P><STRONG>May</STRONG>-&nbsp;refer to April.</P>
<P><STRONG>June</STRONG>-&nbsp;auditioned for&nbsp;cinderella -- Portia</P>
<P>- Finished grade 11</P>
<P><STRONG>July</STRONG>- left for&nbsp;Europe</P>
<P><STRONG>August</STRONG>- **europe**</P>
<P><STRONG>September</STRONG>- GOT BACK SHIT YEAH!</P>
<P>-started grade&nbsp;12&nbsp;and Cinderella rehearsals</P>
<P>-started history&nbsp;12 and acting&nbsp;12</P>
<P><STRONG>October</STRONG>-&nbsp;Cinderella rehearsals </P>
<P>-Christa's halloween suaree on the 30th was rockin,&nbsp;I was Hitler.</P>
<P>- got all hooched up on halloween and went to The Rocky Horror Picture&nbsp;Show downtown.</P>
<P><STRONG>November- </STRONG>Fucking show month, YAY!</P>
<P>-tech weekend slayed all, soo fun, go team.</P>
<P>-show week was rockin, except for the sickness, and vomiting.</P>
<P>-cast parties slayed, I didn't get to alice's though, shitty deal.</P>
<P><STRONG>December-</STRONG> Recovered from cinderella</P>
<P>-Waited for xmas</P>
<P>-boxing day--went shopping bought some shizat, bought a game that I can play MARIO on!</P>
<P>-random partying until new years</P>
<P>-new years, at Morgan Palmer's (Heath's sister) party, low key, but still rockin.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And now, for 2005. . .</P>
<P>What will be of the rest of grade 12? Will I turn into a hippie as I so desire? Or will I become a hermit because I now have actual classes to go to? Whatever the outcome, grad is in June, and so, I must find a dress. Ah, the greatly feared ""grad dress""... I'm so not looking forward to this shit, at all. </P>
<P>So...I think I have finally decided what I'm going to do post-sec style. I'll probably head to SFU and hit up a Bachelor of Education with extended minors in Theatre and History (possibly women's studies if theatre craps out and doesn't work with the teaching degree). So, if all goes well, I should be a teacher by the time I'm 23. </P>
<P>Scholarships *shiver*. You know what's hard? Applying for Universities and Scholarships with only one academic class in your grade 12 first semester. I'm dumb.</P>
<P>That's what's going down in my world right now. </P>"

sooo....too many things to be said about things, and that sort of thing. you know what i mean? i'm hella confused, hard to make decisions regarding situations. uncertainty makes me unoptimistic, and being to scared to say anything or ask questions doesn't help. 

i need a job, i need my driver's license, and other such things. I feel so helpless without any independance. i hate relying on other people, and not having money. but the thing is, i can't get a job until i have my license, henceforth the vicious cycle continues. 

diet coke slays regular coke. 

i have matured a huge amount since last christmas, in a good way, kind of. i'm done with being on the younger/annoying part of ""young adult"", when can i come up to the better half? i suppose when i get a job and a driver's license. fuck.

i look like absolute shit these days. so that's a bonus.

I'm moderately psyched, definately bringing Seussy (dr.seuss pillow) and Cordy (corduroy blanket thing). Oh right, almost forgot, I'm totally bringing my guitar, so yeah, go team. Hmm...everyone think of a good movie we can watch, I think we should watch ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" because, well, I want to, friggin love that movie. Especially the part where her mom's trailor blows up, and a beer can gets fused to her hand, muahaha. 

What the hell are we going to do with ourselves after the show...hmm...well, I'll be doing nothing. Definately not getting a job. Don't care. I suppose I will do homework? yes. homework. I think we should form a band, that would be sweet. Maybe we could be called ""The Blaus"" haha...Dunkelblau and Helblau, oh yeah, and gelp! (dark blue=dunkelblau, light blue=helblau, yellow=gelp)

So, I learned how to file a tax return today, which would be handy, if I had a freaking job. Not that I want one. Poop on Bush, just take a phat dump on his head. Kerry, you pussy, I hope you get herpes. I suggest a pirate revolution for Canada; in so much as, we go down there to rape and pillage, and poop on their heads. I wish I was smart enough to legitimately rant about international politics. 

I've started playing guitar more often, which is nice, but I need some peeps to jam with, even if they would just sing. I played 'Stairway' for about an hour, that solo is not even vaguely attemptable, you just have to stop and listen to it. I miss the days of chillin' and jammin' it up, we need to start that again.

So...weekend is coming up, hopefully heading out to SFU (eric please house me:D), if I can convince the parental units, maybe they will be dazzled by my report card of 2 clases...89% in history, fuckin rights. I want to see ""SAW"" tomorrow night, it looks so god damned scary; I heart scary movies. 

Damn it's gotten hella cold tonight, maybe she'll freeze over. Can't wait for snowboarding season to start. If I buy a hemlock pass, it will cost me almost $400, pfft, dang, but quel worth it. I can't wait for snow, winter is my favorite season, no contest. Rain so isn't cool. Aah, I just put socks and a blanket in the dryer, and I shall proceed up to sleeping quarters when that annoying buzzer goes off on the machine de la dryer.

"event","I have decided that I'm done with highschool. After this Cinderella business, I want to be done. I don't want to have grad pics, grad, scholarship bullshit, dry grad fees, or anything of the sort. I want to leave for christmas break, and never come back. Last year I told myself, I'm not going to pull a ""grade 12"" and never come to school, or stop being social with my core group of friends, but it's happened. I've done alot of growing up in the past month, I don't know if anyone has noticed, but now that I reflect on it, I'm a very different person. In ways I have become more responsible, reliable, and less fun, spontaneous, and drunk. Last week was intense, in every respect. I was so tired and had no emotional restraint left, I was a mess. I would be either bitchy, furious, sad, laughing uncontrollably, there was no happy medium. Stress gets to you that way I guess. Bleh, I hate graduation shit, I want to hire a grade 11 slave bitch to do all of my grad shit, hmm I have $60. *The new Eminem song isn't completely horrible, it's tres catchy, and I'm a fan of the AHAHHAHAHAA*.  What happened to fun weekends? They are becoming scarce. If in this past week I freaked out at anyone or said something mean, disregard it, I needed to vent. So, now that I have unloaded that from my frontal lobes, I'm outie."

"event","Well, it's thanksgiving dinner here and my family is over; both sets of grandparents, great aunt/uncle, and uncle and aunt. To pass the time, Nik, Marina, and I went to roger's to get some movies. I rented Apocolypse Now, and The Thin Red Line. Today in acting we watched Saving Private Ryan; it crippled me for the rest of the day. I don't know why I was so affected by it, but I was. It was reallllly good, except for the fact that they were american. I'm so not down with americans taking glory from WWII. So I'm psyching myself up for Apocolypse Now, as I haven't seen it before. War stuff is interesting, and scary, but I love it. I downloaded an episode of Band of Brothers, it's also really good, but american. Canada should get out there and make some war movies, it would make me happy."

"event","Holy f-ing crap. *Deep Breath*

So, this is how it went down mah babies, keep cool.

FRIDAY:
a) School was absolute crap - History test that was WAY too hard for any human.          
                              Did shitty in my acting scene.
                              Dad was at school helping to build set, and realized that I do nothing all day.
                              Realized that my weekend plans might be completely non-existant if I don't take some initiative.

b) After school was ok      - Just chilled at school for a bit, convinced el cyndo to not take me home, so we hung out a little.
                              Callym schooled me at chess, I felt, less than adequate.
                              Went home at around five or something.

c) Home was well, home      - Home equals death, that is all.

d) Dairy Queen adventure    - Nik drove me to DQ, as that is where I was meeting Christa (and supposedly Eric at 9)
                              We went a little bit early for some brownie earthquakes.
                              When entering the parking lot, we saw a random mustang with some rowdy guys about to fight some guys in a cab, quelle random.
                              Ate some ice cream, and got a hold of Eric to meet us there (for a little back story, I haven't seen him for 3 weeks)

e) Eric arrives             - I ran outside to greet him when I saw the wood pannelled van pull up.
                              When I went to give him a hug, I saw his hand contraption, and felt like crying.
                              But it was all good, so we went inside to grab Christa.
                              We soon realized that Nik had left, with my stuff in the trunk, so we called him to bring it back, haha.

f) Departure of Maple Ridge - So, it didn't take us long to realize that there were three of us, and two seats in cj's truck.
                              We then proceeded to build Eric a nest behind the front seats.
                              Farewell Maple Ridge see you --wasn't sure at this point when I would get home.

g) The misadventures of SFU - We got took a wrong turn for like three seconds going up the mountain.
                              When we arrived we had no where to park, so we picked a random spot.
                              Not two minutes after, a car pulls up, and a chick was like ""um, I think that's my spot"", DAMN we thought.
                              We went to the most random spot we could find and tried be stealthy, as usual.
                              By the way, random spot = operation 253.

f) Le Dorm                  - A dorm is slightly too small for three people to be in, in general.
                              We watched some ""Trouver Nemo"" en francais, for a little bit.
                              At 12:30 or something, we ordered some pizza, and a coke.
                              An hour later, Gurgit came to the door with pizza and ""RC Cola"" (which does weird things to me, unexplainable things).
                              Needless to say, the pizza was inhaled by one triple entente consisting of Eric, CJ, and I.

g) Foamies are my friend    - We constructed a bed, pour moi, with a foamie, and my sleeping bag, it was adequate.
                              So, that was that, and I was asleep, they stayed up a little later, but I was dead.

SATURDAY

h) Early birds=a tired bunch- We got up at 8:30, don't ask why, because we don't know.
                              Eric and Christa were looking pics on google of the world's biggest spiders, I was terrified.
                              So we go down and get some breakfast, and by breakfast, I mean styrafoam eggs that came out of egg juice.

i) Exit Christa stage left  - CJ left at 1 pm or so, and we left around there too.
                              Eric, Matt (eric's friend), and I went for a walk down to Burnaby mountain park, the view was -------!
                              Matt lent me his transit pass, and saved me a few bucks, yay for Matt!

j) And so it begins         - We leave SFU and it takes us an hour and a bit to get down town, we missed a few stops.
                              Down town we browsed around Granville for a bit, and jutted across the bridge to Granville Island.
                              There we went to the kids place, and played arcade games for a WHILE.
                              Eric amazed me by playing Puzzle Bobble with one hand, quite skilled.
                              I played a few random games trying to get some tickets.
                              When we cashed in our tickets, all we could get was two army men, so we did.
                              Then Eric impressed me right out of my pantaloons by sneakily shoplifting lots 
                              of fun stuff with... I dont know, magic? I blinked and missed it.

k) Island fevah             - We looked for somewhere to eat for a good two hours, we were quite indecisive.
                              Someone asked us if we knew where the restaurant ""Bridges"" was, so we were like, hmm, let's go to Bridges.
                              We only had some fishy tasting caesar salad, and calamari, as we aren't rich. 
                              Back to the mountain!

l) Transit is sketch        - We figured out what needed to happen to get home by that week, transit is a bitch.
                              Got back to SFU, and had the best thing ever (apple crisp pizza, haaaaaaaa *drools*).
                              Gathered our shiat, then CHEESED it to the bus stop.
                              We ran down with our stuff, plus eric's obscene amount of dirty laundry.
                              The bus was late, and people that left for the bus stop, and walked, were even there early.
                              There was no time in between stops we were booting it between them.
                              We had 20 minutes to get to Braid station from the mountain, and there is a sky train in between.
                              Booted it from the bus up to the skytrain at some random stop, I forget which one.
                              Now, we had 7 minutes to get to Braid from the sketchy stop.
                              Time was running out, and we sent our PLEASE HELP US energy out and arrived at Braid.
                              When we got there we RAN down the stairs to see an empty bus (pretty much) and an ambulance.
                              Our bus that we needed to catch, had a crack whore tripping out on it, the paramedics got her out of there.
                              If the crack whore didn't have an ""epileptic fit"", we totally would have missed the bus, sorry crachwhore.
                              So, Braid to Coquitlam station, then onto the 701 back to Maple Ridge.
                              On the bus back to Maple Ridge eric and I played tandem mario on his laptop.
                              Cindy picked us up from Haney place and brought us back for Emily's partay.

m) Partay                   - So, when we arrived, it was less than a PARTAY.
                              A few drunkies but nothing too exciting yet.
                              I'm sure I'll here exactly how it went down on monday.


So this, brings me to the point where I am updating my live journal on eric's laptop, while the world sleeps at 9:30 am on a Sunday.
The weekend was spit in your eye kick you in the crotch fantastic.

Peace mah babies."

If I don't get straight A's, they're pulling me from the show, and I don't think they're kidding this time. I only have 2 academics first semester, so I should be able to pull it off. As if grade 12 isn't enough pressure as is, I have like oriental parents that will absolutely kill me (not exaggerating in any respect) if I don't turn into a genius over night. I hope that my teachers will accept bribes this year, I'm going to be the suck up of the century. So, Liz, I have appointed you as my French helperoonie (during rehearsal after school and shit), haha, hope you don't mind! Damn, last year was so easy, you know, no work, no going to class, I miss that."

--results of shopping--
a) old navy sucks monkey balls, there's nothing left there.
b) acquired 2 new jeans from you guessed it, fucking zellers (levi's are universal, n'est pas?)
c) transited with marina, need say more (puke)
d) re-peirced cartledge, cost me $40, what the hell?
e) had some shifty chinese food for lunch, chicken what?
f) props on future shop, haven't really been there until today.
g) winners was soooo not worth the journey from coquitlam station, then back to coquitlam centre.
h) if i were chinese/japanese, i think i would fit in better at coquitlam centre
i) bought 3 Shrek stickers from those dinky little machines that cost a loonie (got shrek, donkey, and shrek donkey and puss n boots) so i'm hella stoked
j) went to buy a cell phone cover, and it was $30, needless to say, i didn't buy one

"event","I'm shitting, I don't know what classes to take. It's pretty scary just thinking about it. I think I'm going to take 5 provincials, English, Biology, History, Geography, Lit. I really don't want to take Bio, I hate Carlese, and Bohn. I will end up skipping everyday. Frick, I hate this. I have no idea of what I'm going to do after highschool, well I'm going to some kind of post-sec education, but who knows what. I'm too young to make these decisions, haha, I feel like I'm going into grade 10, but apparantly not.

aargh."

"event","Went to Venice yesterday, all I can say is ""holy friggin shit"". Other than the hepatitis A infested water and angry pigeons, it was soooooo cool. I can't really describe it but I have lots of pictures so I'll show you guys when I get home. 13 days! hehehehehe. I can't wait to go school supplies shopping, muahhaa.

I just watched Dumb and Dumber, some Steven Sigall movie, and Friday the 13th 2. I thought that Friday the 13th would be some corny, stupid, half-ass movie, but it isn't! Well, it is corny, but it's freaking scary too. Maybe I'm a wimp, but I'm a little bit scared right now, haha. It was pretty 70's, and everyone wore either no clothing, or bootie shorts."

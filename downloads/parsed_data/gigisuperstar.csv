I remember on the last day of school last yr i was all ""THESE PEOPLE WILL ALWAYZ BE A PART OF MY LIFE EVEN IF IT KILLS ME,I LOVE THEM!!!""...but sadly it didn't turn out that way over the summer.I mean of course i wanted to keep N touch w/ all my CHS peeps but it just didn't happen & i felt bad goin into this school yr knowin that & it really hurt me cause i really did & still do love all those people.So i was on myspace yesterday and a really good friend of mine found me.Now,when i get friends request i usually just look at the lil profile pic & if I kno who it is right off i'm liek ""yay!!ok""  but something told me to look at this person's page so i did & when i realized who it was i was liek ""OMG!!HEEY!!!"" and they were liek ""HEEY!!!"" and it made me feel soo good that they remembered me.

They could've easily skipped over my page and been liek ""no it's ok gigi never called me anyway"" but they didn't and i was soo glad cause liek i said they were a really good friend to me last yr.I mean we only had Sci class together but still we alwayz talked N that class and he was a really goood friend of mine.So we talked and he started makin me realize how much i miss CHS & every1 there.I REALLY do miss it there.And now i'm just soo glad i got myspace cause it's liek i have FREAKIN EVERYTHING!!I mean i have all my CHS friends and even tho i don't see them everyday i can talk to them & that really makes me happy cause i missed my friend & every1 else there.I'm just glad i found them again & i can talk to them now.I feel liek i finally have my life back.I still miss seeing them everyday and i wish i never had to miss them during these ""high school"" years..and i wish i never had to miss them at all.

So we started school bac up this week & my week was ok.There are a few things that i wish i could change bout the next week or fix rather and it'll be botherin me for a while but i have faith that it'll get better & hopefully wat i NEED to happen will happen soon...REALLY soon.I've just been real bummed out this week.

I called Leena 2night tho & that made me happy.=)

And this ""bummed"" out feelin wouldn't happen soo much if i lived N Tennessee or where ever my best friend lived.

So yea not much but there's soo much more that could be making me happy but i gues s life's not alwayz fair huh??..Well i'll HoLlA!!..i'm goin on myspace.

[[EDIT!!]]
FREAKIN A!!! i just got on myspace and it's actin up AND i was N the middle of messaging Steven.

I'm sitting here w/ just nothing,nothing to do,it's about 10 so i guess i'll start watchin MTV or BET or something.I can't believe the break is almost over and that really sucks,i'm not ready for Jan & school to come back.The only thing that makes me happy bout Jan is that Leena's 'possed to be comming here to visit.I'm thinking bout posting ""shout outs"" over on myspace but i donno most likely cause i have some awesome people N my life and they need to kno how much i appreciate & love them.
I had fun in NC,i got to see my sister (cuzin) Jazz and that was a lotta fun!!!haha,stayin up till 5am..good times,good times.I hope i get to do that again real soon!!Well,i g2g i'll prob have those ""shouts"" posted on myspace later.I'll HoLlA!!

1. To the people who have like 25,098 friend's, are you serious? Nobody in this universe has that many friends...you're stupid. Go shoot yourself...except you Tom.

2. If you're ugly stop acting like you don't know it. The captions under you picture that says ""top model pose"" doesn't convince anybody. at least you can work on your personality

3. Don't ever post pictures and say ""omg im so ugly"" because if you were, you wouldn't post them. please put away the rod and reel cause your just fishin for compliments.

4. Nobody cares about threats over the internet. Don't try to act hard with the keyboard...that's so sad. unless you actually physically beat someone with the keyboard. then thats ironically hilarious.

5. If all your pictures look the same...don't post them all! Please put some variety in your pics. Nobody wants to see your face 8 different ways. I don't care if its inverted, black and white, or faded out. a face is a face is a face.

6. Who really gives a rats ass if I don't accept you as a friend...MOVE ON. Don't send me another request or message asking ""what's up?"" I don't want you as a friend or I just don't care, that's what's up!

7. LITTLE 6TH, 7TH, AND 8TH GRADERS who have myspace and LOOK LIKE SLUTS, go somewhere else because NOBODY wants you here except pedophiles, and is that what you want?

8. No one is really going to die in 6 days or have bad relationships for 5 years if they don't pass your bulletin on. so stop saying that!

9. If you have decided to read this, You are a true Myspace Friend. Real friends read their bulletins.

10. It serves to eliminate people who are desperately trying to add ""friends"" like it's a popularity contest in high school. Good riddance!

This is a test to see how many people in your friends list actually pay attention to you. Copy and repost in your own bulletin as ""10 UNWRITTEN RULES OF MYSPACE"""

As you grow up, you learn that even the *ONE PERSON* that wasn't supposed to *EVER* 
let you down *PROBABLY WILL*. You will have *YOUR HEART* broken probably more than 
once and it's *HARDER EVERY TIME*. You'll break hearts too, so *REMEMBER* how it 
felt when *YOURS* was broken. You'll fight with your best friend. You'll blame a 
*NEW LOVE* for things an *OLD* one did. You'll *CRY* because time is passing too fast, 
and you'll eventually lose *SOMEONE YOU LOVE*. So take *TOO MANY* pictures, laugh 
*TOO MUCH*, and love like you've *NEVER BEEN HURT* cause every sixty seconds you 
spend upset is a minute of happiness you'll never get back.

So yes,my birthday was this week & so was my best friend Leena's=)It was good must say i went out to dinner & got presents & stuff-a LV purse,jewlery,sisterhood of the traveling pants DVD and..A LAPTOP!!!...yes & i was SOOOOO suprised...SOOO suprised & i didn't even ask for it..i was gonna wait till x-mas so i was VERY thankful for that and it's SOOOO kool!!!I LOVE it!!!Then on Thurs i called Leena for her b-day & talked to her & it was just SOOO great.I got to hear her voice & kno how xcited she was & it made me feel SOOOOOOOO,SOOOOOOOOOO good expecially since i miss her soo much & was just soo much fun!!=) And for the 1st time N a while it made me truly,truly happy & it felt good.AND!!I got the card she sent me this mornin!!!I was SOOOOO xcited & happy & my lil sister tried to ruin my mood & i told her not to be mad that if her best friend ever moved that they wouldn't be able tp keep N touch liek Leena & I...haha.And ANOTHER xciting thing-my mom & i were talkin earlier & she came up w/ the BEST idea &  I mean it was just SOOOOO great & it's really got me happy i just hope somehow it can work out cause if it did my life would be SOOOOOOOOOOO,SOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than it is now & just thinkin bout it & the possibility of this happenin has me xcited!!!=) *smiles huge*

So well yea if my mother's ever so brilliant idea works out i'd finally feel like my life was the way i want it to be for once.I think i'm well not selfish at times but if just feels liek i've gone threw soo much this yr that this 1 thing could make *EVERYTHING* soo much better.I'll HoLlA!!<333

But something really xciting that's gonna be happenin N my life...MY BIRTHDAY...it's commin up this week on Wed and i'm SOOOO xcited..i'll finally  be 16 and that's pretty kool.I already kno wat kinda party i wanna have now i just have to call my friends...haha but i'm not gonna have it for a bit so i've got time to call people & such.I'm tryin to get into the birthdasy mood & it seems w/ everything else  that's been goin on i can't but i WILL when my b-day comes...NOTHING i mean NOTHING can keep me from bein happy on my birthday.I alwayz see that day diffrent,lol..I'm liek ""This is the day i was born & NOTHINNG can ruin my day today""...t's pretty kool i'm all N a good mood & i kno every1 is on there b-day but it seems liek that's the only day of the yr when i've truly happy..i guess that's kinda good tho,i'd rather at least be soo happy one day of the yr then never,lol.Then Leena's is after mind on the 3rd so it's liek double the xcitement & yea it's just a really kool thing to have my brithday then my best friend's so yea!!=) *getz xcited*..Should be a great week.

So we had FSU homecommin this weekend too & it went good i mean there was soooooo many ppl at the game & yes,we kicked some Maryland ass!!! yup yup!!The game was god but near the end it started gettin cold & i just HATE cold weather..i can't stand it!!Then last weekend i went to FAMU's homecommin w/ my fam & it was real good & the only reason for that was case i got to see  a good friend of mine that i haven't seen N a while & it was just good to see them.We didn't hang out or anything we just talked for a bit & yea.I'm glad i got to see them tho..it made me really happy for about 3 dayz then i went bac to how i am now.

So that's bout everything that's goin on N my life right now & yea.I gotta go & make me some breakfast cause i'm hungry & everything & i have a few other thing i gotta do on the comp so i'll HoLlA!!!

"event","WOW-so this week has been one of those weeks for me,one of those weeks where I really start to realize the things & people who mean the most to me.This has prob been one of the longest weeks of my life & i donno it's just weird..i NEVER have long weeks..but this one happened to be long...really long.This week made me think about things more than i never have.This week made me realize just how much i love & care about certian people and it also made me more thankful for those people once again.It seems liek my whole life i've only had about 6 *REALLY* close friends..and i'm ok with that.My whole life i've been the type of person to only have 1 or 2 friends who i always stay close to where ever i go.I don't feel like i need to have tons & tons of friendz to feel soo good bout myself..i don't feel like that at all & I never have & i kno i never will.I get attached to a person and after a while it's liek i only need them to get through life so the thought of leaving them or not being able to see them as much scares me more than anything.It's liek these 6 people have become my life & that's pretty much wat they are...MY LIFE..cause i surround myself around them all the time & not other people.I'm startin to realize just how important school is this yr & that i REALLY need to ""get with it"" or else somethin might happen N my life that i never wanted to.I NEED to make sure i take school seriously enought cause right now there are really 2 people N my life that if something happened & i couldn't see them again or anymore i wouldn't be able to make it through.I'm realizing God didn't only bless me w/ a best friend & a boyfriend but that they're SOO MUCH MORE than just that to me...there two of the people i love more than anyone or anything at the moment.I realize that watever's been holdin me bac i have to just...try my best to let it pass & stay strong.No my life hasn't been at it's best the last few weeks but i've gotten threw them so that says something.And it's not sayin i'm gonna forget the memories or the good times or anything cause i NEVER could..it's too impossible it's just wat i kno i'm gonna have to do..it's the hardest thing to go threw but i just hope i'll be ok.I want a certain part of my life bac but i can't have it & that's wat's been hurtin me the most..i think that's wat's been goin on w/ my school work but now i realize everything happens for a reason & N the end it'll all finally be ok.

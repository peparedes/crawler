"event","I can never decide whether I love everyone or hate them. Sometimes whatever people say or do is interesting, mainly for the reason behind whatever they've said or done. Other times it's more a case of ""WHAT"" or ""REALLY?"" I was exhausted today so there was a lot of the latter going on. In fact, it probably has very little to do with the people themselves, it's All About Me, as always. I feel like I'm going through about a year's worth of deja vu from my last university experience. The stuff we're being taught is really interesting most of the time, but I'm still doing the bare minimum work outside uni. My essay remains unfinished - the first draft deadline is tomorrow and the final draft next Friday. I'm aiming for a C. And I haven't been sleeping again, which is extremely frustrating and leads to a whole load of other things - lack of concentration, irritability, general slacking off. It all just feels a little too familiar. I'm nowhere near panic stage, and still fairly near the top of the Spiral of Misery, but I just wish I didn't have to make things so hard for myself all the damn time.

"event","I have been lurking around these parts a lot lately, but haven't had much to say myself. One of my friends mentioned recently he had a blog and I just know it's about ASPs and FTPS and formatting and how rubbish some new obscure (i.e. non-Windows) software is because it doesn't allow for such and such formatting/convergence/processing something-or-other. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it just would never occur to me to write so much about so little. I notice no small details whatsoever in my life, to the point where after watching a film I can't think of a single thing to say about it besides ""that was good/bad/boring/weird"". If anyone asks a follow up question like ""why?"" I'm way out of my depth. My style is more saying very little about quite big things (to me). My dad moved out. My nursing course is ok. My moods have been up and down."

"event","And now for little bit of gap filling. I'm a terrible writer I know - I have this need to express things but at the same time don't really want to tell anyone anything. In conversations I go on about countless irrelevancies, only touching on what I really wanted to talk about for the briefest of moments, then wonder I'm left feeling unsatisfied. And here I am wondering now if even that's too much information.

But back to the gap filling. Regarding unis, I basically chose neither and was marked down as withdrawn by default. About a week later I got a phonecall asking if I did this on purpose, because their systems had processed it a day early. So I explained and the woman said I could switch branches and I did, just like that. Pretty lucky really, and so far it feels like the right choice. Give it a couple of weeks though, when I'm on placement, which I'm pretty much terrified about. Real patients! Real lives! Real responsibities!

But back to the gap filling. I carried on with my job until 2 weeks before the course started, going on holiday in early July. I went with a couple of friends to Poland and Austria (and Slovakia, but the less said about that the better), and it was really really good. Eleanor of course came back from uni, which was also good, but make sleeping arrangements increasingly difficult, particularly when her boyfriend was staying over. For a very long, aggravating time it was never explained to her why my mum was sleeping in my room, which I found incredibly frustrating and a huge strain. It was sort of like a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, and we all know how stupid that is. Eventually Eleanor asked <b>me</b>, and I was forced to tell her all the stuff that should've been said months ago, plus other additional complications. And then, being so unlike the rest of us, she just confronted my parents with it! I was out at the time and got a very worried phonecall telling me to come home, before being sat down and ""told"" that mummy and daddy are splitting up (but they still love me very much). It would've been funny if it wasn't so fucking awful. My dad made it clear it wasn't his decision, and made it seem like he was just being kicked out. If I didn't know him at all, maybe I would've bought that. It's been a couple of months since then and he's still here. You would think-- ah nevermind. This is what I've come to expect from my family. My parents anyway."

"event","14 weeks on from my previous indecision, I start university tomorrow. I wonder what adventures await, what tales I will tell every so often to no-one in particular. It will probably be usual pattern: things are miserable...things are ok...things are awful...oh look I've quit. Roughly an 18 month cycle. Not to be pessimistic or anything, but it's a lot easier when you're prepared. But I'm kind of running out of career paths to do it for.

On another note, sorry to be predictable, but I hate Sarah Palin, and everything she stands for."

"event","<i>""Happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in it's own way."" --Anna Karenina</i>

The last three months have been hell-like in some respects. Well, one respect. It's like someone overheard me saying I was ok with the whole divorce thing and decided to add a ton more complications and difficulties to really mess it up. And now I'm one of those people who says their ok about something when they're really not.

What I was starting to think would never happen, happened - they talked. My mum told me he didn't think there was anything wrong (!) and he's happy with the way things are (!!). She couldn't quite believe this, but I suppose he doesn't understand what's changed - neither do I really. She doesn't want to see it, but it's clear to me he's still in love with her. When I thought they were both miserable and divorce would be best for them both it was so much easier - now it's going to hurt. Because he was so clueless about their situation my mum didn't feel able to tell him everything, he still think's there hope. So since then my dad has made a couple of utterly painful attempts at small talk with her in an attempt to fix things. That's the only difference there's been.

Then there's the other thing. Despite the level of personal things I go into on here I can't quite do it on this one - there are a lot of other people involved. But basically it's made me see that things aren't as one-sided as I'd thought, that I've been extremely naive and that both my parents are emotionally-damaged, flawed individuals. But at some point I decided to try to stop resenting them for it, and learn from their mistakes. I have sworn to myself I will do everything possible to avoid being unhappy in the same way they are."

"event","The status on my parents relationship is still critical. Valentine's Day was excrutiating. My dad left my mum a standard bunch of flowers and a card addressed ""Mrs [my mum's maiden name]"" on the envelope. Inside it was blank. Ouch. My mum got him a box of chocolates and threw out the card she'd got on seeing his, leaving instead a sombre black and white one of a dying tree branch. Nothing inside. Ouch again. I really thought this would trigger things off and went out so they could talk, but they seem to have ignored it, and 3 days on nothing's changed. I had the mad urge to write ""DIVORCE?"" across both of the cards - maybe that would move things along a little. It's getting quite frustrating. My naive, over-simplified view is that if you're miserable in a relationship, or anything really, do something about it. Don't just sit there watching things get worse. Whatever change you make is going to be difficult, but the sooner you do it the sooner you get through it, and things get better. But you have to make the first steps, and neither of them seems willing or able to. And if the empty gestures and the extreme tension on Thursday wasn't a catalyst for them I don't know what will be."

"event","2008 ay? How did that happen? 2007 was a good year but it was getting old, so it's nice to have a change in the little number at the end of the date. My birthday, Hallowe'en, Fireworks night, Christmas and anything else that's happened since my last update were all standard, but enjoyable. New Year's was mildly disasterous but I enjoyed it anyway. I'm still at the same job, or a similar one in the same department. The work is of course dull, but not unbearable, and the people are nice - they say sorry before giving me all the worst jobs.

The other news I bring you is thus: according to the Family section of the Saturday Guardian today is ""d-day"" - the busiest time of year for divorces. Relevence? My parents are getting divorced. My dad doesn't know it yet, but it's happening. My mum and I have been having hushed discussions about it at various countryside locations, where she looks at me with pained expressions and tells me ""I don't know what to tell you"". The current situation is ridiculous - she doesn't want to do anything until the kitchen has been finished. The kitchen that was started 6 years ago, ground to a halt 5 1/2 years ago and hasn't been touched since. When she said that I thought neither were ever going to happen, then. I expect it'll get worse, but so far I think I'm taking it fairly well, but that doesn't mean I can stop thinking about it. I always assumed there was something I wasn't seeing in their relationship - they've been together for almost 30 years, afterall. Now I know there really, really isn't every interaction they have seems fake, forced and empty. I just want them to get on with it so we can all get on with our lives. I may have to start phoning kitchen people.

This update was brought to you by my unfinished personal statement: because things don't get done if you don't do them."

^ What I ""restored from saved draft"" - don't remember writing it at all. Think it must be from Saturday night - didn't realise I'd been anywhere near a computer. Translation: ""I am a little bit drunk, never written this drunk before. I always seem to write this [when I'm in] the same mood so think I repeat myself. Alright night tonight though, went out. Had difficulty getting home."" Think the last part says ""Got told I was hot!"" - I do remember that, but wish I didn't. It was a good night anyway.

My boss called me Emma at work today. Ok so I've spoken to him about twice and he's never there, but it was still awkward, especially since I was frowning at the colour printer in a world of my own, not responding to the name for at least 5 minutes. And then having to correct him, and his over-enthusiasm in what I was doing to try to make up for it..{wince} I really need to quit. Think I was right in my drunken ramblings - I am always writing this in the same mood, and repeating myself."

"event","I've just been watching The Queen (the film) on ITV1 - ""the Daily Mail of TV"" according to my sister. ""Interesting"" I think is the word I'd use. As a staunch Labour and Tony Blair supporter with a diehard fascination/obsession with the Queen (the person) I was probably in a fairly unique position watching it, so here goes. Some of it was just completely ridiculous. One scene that stuck out was where the Queen was driving Charles about in a 4x4 around the Scottish countryside. Can the Queen even drive? I know she doesn't have to pass her test, but even if she had, is their any world where she would actually be allowed to drive herself, even ignoring that it's her and her son, the next in line to the throne, and a couple of weeks after Diana's crash? What if they'd crashed? And William, recently orphaned and having lost his grandmother within such a sort space of time, and still a teenager, was forced to become King? They're not even allowed on the same plane for goodness sake, let alone go galvanting round Scotland by themselves. And don't even get me started on when the Queen did it again, this time by herself, driving straight into a river and having to phone for help.

Another thing was the amount the Royal family watched TV - it was nearly as much as I do. Surely the Queen doesn't need to actually watch TV and read the tabloids directly to get her information? One of the many things that interest me about her is this detachment from all that - my view is that she'd be surrounded by so many advisors giving telling her these things - there would be several layers of people before such direct exposure to public events and reaction. How I would've done it would to be to show that - all these people around her, always sheltering her and protecting her, never able to get a moment alone because of them. I'd show her constantly having to do these events and meet carefully selected people, always being polite and respectful but not knowing them at all. And all those who will be having one of the most memorable days of their lives even catching a glimpse of her, but to her it's just a sea of unknown faces, and in reality they know as little about her as she does them. There were elements of that in the film, and to me they were the best parts. I loved the idea behind Tony's little tantrum about how she never chose to be Queen, and how she'd seen the job kill her father, but she dedicated her life to it and this country all the same.

Other hilariously stupid parts: Tony Blair acting like some schoolboy having been called into the headmistress' office when meeting her for the first time, awkward and unprepared next to the composed and suddenly very witty Queen. Cherie Blair constantly saying things like ""off to meet your girlfriend"", ""all Labour prime ministers go soft around the Queen"" etc. The Queen effectively predicting the Iraq war - very An Inspector Calls (don't even get me started on that one). The irritating stag metaphor - could it have been any more unsubtle? The way decisions seemed to be made mostly by Tony Blair, the Queen or both - as if either has that much power or control. Philip and the Queen sleeping in the same bed - it feels a bit weird knowing they sleep in separate rooms, but there you have it. Other good parts: Philip and the Queen mother were done well, and were funny too. Some of the stuff about modernising Vs the old traditions - the flag and all that, and the Royal family not understanding the need for change. Erm... Helen Mirren was good, but it was distracting as none of them actually looked like the people they were playing, so they were never entirely believable. Overall it wasn't *that* bad - it had it's moments, but to me it was like on of those dodgy straight-to-TV biopics they show on Channel 5 in the afternoon, rather than this Oscar-worthy depiction of the Royal family in the time around Diana's death.

Ok, rant over. Blame my mum - tried to rant about it to her but she said she didn't feel particularly strongly about it, shockingly. I think I'd annoyed her enough calling out "" but the Queen doesn't have a license plate"", ""surely he would've been told the proper procedure weeks in advance"", ""what about (former HRH) Edward VIII's funeral?"" etc etc all the way through. So I'll leave it there for today I think - was going to mention events in my own life but it'll have to wait. Try to contain yourselves."

"event","Today I spent about 3 hours trawling around Kingston looking for wellies. Eleanor is going to Reading tomorrow and realised only now that they might be a good idea, considering it's been raining continuously all year. Of course, being the day before Reading, there were none to be found, bar one very battered clown-sized pair in Accessorize. It didn't help that she refused to go look in any actual shoe shops, so we went round all her usual clothes shop haunts where ""they sell loads of shoes"". That's not the point! She bought 2 bags of clothes and no wellies, and even I succumbed to Primark and it's super-cheapness by the end. As we'd cycled we had to drop the stuff off at work (which I really should've gone to today) with my mum, and by some twist of luck only Eleanor could manage, someone there had lent a pair in her size to someone else there, who went and got them from her car. 

Having given up cycling a few weeks ago (no-one should have to put their life in danger so much in 20 minutes), and tired from such an ordeal, the journey back was a struggle to say the least. I was under pressure to go fast with Eleanor there as well, so just collapsed when we got home. In the evening I watched the football on TV. It was boorriinng. I want that time back to...go on the internet or something."

On Saturday I saw Harry Potter at the iMAX with my mum and Eleanor. It was so weird. Everything was so BIG - obviously that's the point, but it was to the point where it was ridiculous - half the time I was thinking ""is it really necessary for it to be *quite* so humongous?"" The 3D parts especially - all of a sudden there'd be this massive HAND coming out of the screen, it was kind of distracting. But still amazing. Yesterday I went to Wimbledon with my mum. She talked about chairs and work, her 2 great passions in life. Then out of nowhere she fixed this nauseating look on me and said ""you're looking well"". What, as opposed to looking like I'm on my deathbed? Erm, thanks?* I switched the subject back to chairs. Every day for the last 3 years it's been ""we need new chairs"" and now suddenly it's moved into Stage 2 - trawling around every furniture shop within a 100 miles radius for one that meets the almost impossible criteria of what's required in this chair. The next step is possibly worse - agonisingly debating the pros and cons of each on the shortlist, before eventually choosing a completely different one, hand-crafted by Tibetan monks using the hairs of the rare Mongolian sea lion and shipped from outer Turkmenistan. Which results in a slightly upmarket-looking standard chair that we've just had to remortage the house to pay for. If it were up to me I'd go to Ikea, find the cheapest one and buy 2 in black. Apparently I don't ""understand"" home furnishing.

Eleanor has been allowed to quit her job at Thorpe Park. I'm happy for her, because it does sound truly awful (though she did get to see Vic Reeves and Ludicrous), and it is more interesting with her around the house. I don't know what I'm going to do with myself when she goes back to Cardiff. Don't really see much of her now though - there are only a couple of days a week when she's not at Martin's or he's not staying here. He is a nice guy, but honestly, it is a *bit* much. Jealous, moi? Perhaps with my new found ""wellness"" will solve this. It has occured to me how little I know about relationships. I sometimes wonder if my parents' is in trouble - they're rarely in the same room together, they don't seem to have anything in common or even like each other and when they do talk it's about bills and taxes and building societies. But is that just what happens when you've been with someone that long? I really have no idea.

"event","I've been feeling quite restless recently, no doubt from having nothing to do all day except maybe go to my soul-destroying job. I don't think I mentioned it's where my mum works - I don't tend to admit it unless someone directly asks how I got it, so they are usually under the illusion I earnt my place there. It's stupid really, because there are huge downsides to such sickening nepotism. I'm with my mum for about 90% of each working day - it would be an understatement to say there was a lot of cabin fever (from both sides, but mostly from me). This reached it's peak a couple of months ago with that groundswell of work - everything she would say or do would be infuriating to me. The more recent problem is the opposite. Being able to work whatever hours I want used to be a big benefit, but now that I'm sick to death of everything about my job - the duties, the office, the journey there - I use it to mean ""you can work as little as possible"". I didn't go in at all this week, choosing to do a few hours from home instead, and no-one said a word about it. So I'm restless. I've been writing a lot of lists - things do, places to go, books to read, films to watch etc. but it's unlikely I'll get round to doing any of them. However the day passes, whether I'm saving the world or watching TV in my pyjamas, it always does - and then it's just on to the next one."

"event","I started cycling to work on Tuesday, to try and save money from the bus fare. I have since discovered that I am the world's worst, unluckiest cyclist. After the falling off incident a couple of weeks ago I was quite shaky and very cautious to begin with, and it was fine on the way there, but on the way back this elastic rope thing somehow got tangled up in the chain cog part. I was there in the pouring rain trying to get it out for over half an hour, my hands blackened with grease and my clothes utterly drenched. Eventually this guy stopped and said ""if I were a boy scout I would help you...sorry"". At first I was all ""oh that's ok, thanks anyway"" but he kept standing there and I didn't know what to say after that. Turns out he did help hugely by telling this Canadian guy about it, and he came over and yanked the thing out after a lot of grunting. Even then I still couldn't get it to work because the chain was all messed up and by then he'd gone, plus had to then cycle the rest of the way in a thunderstorm - could barely even see the roads.

So that was Tuesday. On Wednesday I almost got run over - I clearly signalled to make a right turn, and started to do so when out of the corner of my eye I saw a lot of blue, and when I looked round this car was literally centimetres away, and honking madly on his horn. It was also quite embarrassing because Martin, who works in my office, saw the whole thing, and gave me this sort of sheepish wave afterwards. Then today I ran over a drawing pin at the very beginning of the journey home, and had to go all the way back with a flat tyre, making a very loud squelching noise. As if that wasn't enough this kid threw a ball of string at me as well! Who does that? It was more confusing than anything. On Saturday I'm going to see the Tour de France (in London) - bet all this stuff doesn't happen to them. Hmmph."

I want so much to quit - it was only supposed to be for about a month and it's now been more than 5. I can't leave now though - it would be like leaving a sinking ship.

"event","Tragically our neighbours' unsecure wireless network stopped working on my laptop in May, just as I had become completely dependant on it and was using it to fill every gap in the day. As a result a campaign to finally put the old dial-up to rest had to be started, and it's finally paid off. Hurrah!

Things have been generally ok. I'm still working at my old job, but it's suddenly become incredibly hard and stressful and feels like a real job. One of the people on our little team selfishly went and got glandular fever, so I'm sort of half doing her job now, despite being not even remotely qualified to do it. Thankfully someone else was brought in a couple of weeks ago to to the phoning side of it. I do still have to answer the phone occassionally though - for the first month I just let it ring and people looked at me weirdly. Now it still fills my heart with dread to hear it. When I pick up I says things things like ""Erm hello? Yes...I don't know how to do that...I don't know who does that...I don't know what we do really"" - even when I do know the answer things these words just seem to fall out. The rest is ok - everyone's been on a bit of a knife edge recently like I say. Had a horrible moment last week when I was utterly swamped and started to feel ill - naturally felt like I was going to die, but knew I had to continue. Ended up running to the toilets and throwing up about 15 times in the sink, but then carrying on as normal.

I am of course re-addicted to Big Brother - I gave up trying to give up in January. Like(d): the twins, Chanelle, Gerry, Lesley, Shabnam. Dislike(d): Seany, Emily, Ziggy. That's all I am going to say on the matter. Recently I've also been watching repeats of Gladiators rather obsessively, and shamefully Hollyoaks as well. It makes me feel dirty and sick watching it, but I can't help it. Felt the need to do something different the Sunday before last, so went to the West London Green Fair with my dad, where he was running a stall. Unfortunately it was after a night of very little sleep and horrific nightmares about Myra Hindley, and we had to cycle 8 miles each way to get there. The Green Fair itself was good - had some cyclist nutters interrogating us about the routes, but by the end of it I was getting quite into it. Unfortunately my tiredness caught up with me on the cycle back, resulting in a very embarassing crash into some railing, ending in me trapped under my bike. I'm still bruised from it now. It's not easy being green."

"event","Hmm, I was 50/50 on deleting this, but then I re-read a few old entries and it brought back some memories. It's funny, I always used to be so self-critical of whatever I wrote - I always thought it was either too boring or melodramatic or self-pitying or ignorantly opinionated, but now I'm a lot less harsh on myself.

Today I went to Wimbledon Common with my parents, Leslie and his friend Peter. It was nice. I spent most of it talking to Peter, because everyone else was talking among themselves, and also because he was a new, interesting person. I love old people, I find everything they say fascinating, as long as it's not too, er, ""conservative"". He told me about his childhood, and being in the army, then his later life, and it was just so different from my life and anything I've ever experienced. It annoyed me slightly that everyone was treating him differently because they'd been told he was losing his memory - anything they said was almost embarassingly patronising. Most of the time he was absolutely fine - they were just going by what they'd been told and not actually taking the time to get to know him, and see for themselves. Seeing Leslie yesterday individually was equally fascinating, and I actually learnt a lot from him too. I think, after I get myself out of this rut of administrative work, I'd quite like to do some work in an old people's home, even if it's only temporarily. I would just like to take the time to listen to them, and make sure they're being looked after.

Not much else has happended this week - I did about 2 hours' work - still waiting to hear back from this woman about when to start my new job. My friends all have exams at the moment so I haven't seen much of them. Weird thought - this is the first May/June I haven't had exams for 11 years. This is a huge relief - I'm terrible with revision, usually starting about 2 hours before the exam. Which is ok, but those 2 hours are painfully stressful, and I always forget this and never change my ways. I am trying to do aome sort of learning occasionally, to prevent my brain from rotting entirely in case I ever want to use it again."

Interesting few months, not really worth dwelling on them though. Basically I moved back home at the beginning of February and it was undoubtedly the right thing to do. Since then I've got a job doing admin work, which is now coming to an end, but I've got another one lined up doing pretty much the same thing. Not life changing stuff, but work's work and I get paid and for now that's enough. At the moment I feel fine, but am also heavily medicated.

"event","Many a thing has happened since my last (rather melodramatic) update. I'm at home at the moment - I came back for Christmas and New Year, then went to Bangor for a couple of weeks, then came back here again. It has all been very up and down. I don't really want to go into it. There was a point where I was seeing 5 therapist-type people a week - that's now been whittled down to 2/3, but I'm still sick of hearing myself drone on. The holidays were good, not that I was really taking a holiday from anything, apart from Bangor itself. It was nice to have normal TV (no S4C Welsh programmes about being Welsh) and to see my mum and to have a bed that isn't wafer thin and doesn't creak when you breathe. I actually slept well almost every night, it was amazing. I didn't want to leave home again by the end of it, but kind of had to. Had a bad week, then an ok one, then re-left under the cover of my dad's birthday on Thursday. But really I just need a(nother) break.

Sigh, Big Brother. Oh Jo. I've only actually seen about 4 episodes - the minute I saw Jo step out of the car I tried my hardest to stay well clear, just because I used to like her, a lot. But the worst I thought would happen was she'd be one of the boring ones, blathering on about the shopping list and the cleaning and conspiracy theories - nothing like this. And she is, in my view, the worst one among them. From what I've seen, she made some of the worst comments, and hasn't even made any attempt to apologise, however real, because she doesn't think she's done anything wrong. And she's sort of slipped under the radar and not come under nearly as much attack as Jade and Danielle by not being so...vocal. It may be that she's just fallen furthest in my mind. I also can't believe she's friends with Jodie Marsh, lol. Enough has been said about the other two - it's spiralled out of control now and I just want it to end. Shilpa to win."

"event","I can't remember the last time I got to sleep before 4am. I'm not even sure if it is after 4am because of the whole time switching thing. I always forget what I've set back the night before and what sets itself back automatically, that is if I even remember the damn thing in the first place. So it could be 3:48am or 5:48am for all I know. Anyway, I thought at least I'd be getting an extra hour of sleep last night, only to be woken up by the bloody fire alarm. I leapt out of bed to get quickly dressed, thinking for a second I was still back in halls. The ""fire"" was supposedly coming from my room, so either I was burnt alive and am a ghost and don't know it, like in The Others, or there is something wrong with our smoke detectors. Either way I was in a bad mood for most of the day becuase of it. 2 of my housemates have gone home for 4 days and the other works weekends so I have been by myself for a considerable amount of the last 2 days. It has been both nice and horrible equally. My mum phoned this evening and I literally could not stop talking, just because it was some sort of human contact.

I am giving serious consideration to dropping out of university. Occasionally I feel a twinge of interest in Psychology, but it's not enough to motivate me to do the work, and I feel like it's making my condition worse. If you had some physical illness you wouldn't sit there focusing on it, seeing where it hurts and studying the pain. There was a time I though it would help me understand it, but I don't think that I ever will. And I don't think I'll ever recover from it either. It's been too long, too much damage has already been done. What's holding me back from just leaving is not having a clue what else I would do - sometimes I feel the urge to do something creative but know I have no talent whatsoever in any of those areas. I'm tied to this house until the end of June so can't go anywhere else - the only real option would be to get a job. A meaningless, repetitive, tedious, low-paying job - and that surely isn't a good idea. The book I'm currently reading told me ""don't make decisions"", which must have to be the worst advice ever. It's just not physically possible.

On a lighter note I am completely addicted to Pobol Y Cwm (a Welsh soap). I got hooked trying to find out a character's secret after seeing some of it accidently and now can't stop. I still don't know that secret and now 2 hours of my week are taken up watching the omnibus. Imogen made a cameo appearance the other week, speaking Welsh and everything, it was hilarious. Everyone who doesn't live in Wales is seriously missing out."

"event","Top 10 Crime/Mystery Solving TV Programmes (in honour of Murder, She Wrote afternoon repeats returning to BBC1)

1. The X-Files - Ok, so it went downhill when Mulder was replaced by Terminator 2 but the first 7 seasons are some of the best of any programme ever, and Mulder/Scully is the ultimate ship.
2. CSI - It has it faults, but the Grissom/Sara (now canon) ship is always brilliant. It can be great when it wants to be.
3. Without A Trace - Not S4. Without that truly awful mess of a year it would be No.2. And if they hadn't forgotten about the once great Jack/Sam affair (a lot of this list is ship-based).
4. MacGyver - Work. of. genius.
5. Murder, She Wrote - Ahh Murder, She Wrote. Completely ridiculous, about the cheesiest programme still on TV and yet so addictive. Good to have it back.
6. Cagney and Lacey - Not the first to have a ship based mostly on the ambiguous use of the word ""partner"" but possibly the best. Or maybe that's just me.
7. Diagnosis Murder - The newer ones. Which until very recently I was convinced were the older ones. I was beyond shocked. The ones with Jesse in anyway.
8. Midsomer Murders - So bad it's good. Only the ones with Troy and RealCully, now there's an obscure ship. I love each town looses about 1/5th of it's population within an episode. And it's always the oldest, most decrepit person who did it, because of some village fete or choir competition.
9. Poirot - Cracks me up.
10. (What's New) Scooby Doo - Seriously. I love Velma.

It has been a fairly standard couple of weeks. I had an exam today - wrote that list instead of revising for it. It went ok. We have been carving pumpkins. I made the most twisted, evil one you've ever seen - it's face is contorted in a cross between anger and pain. I want to say ""it's like looking in a mirror"" but that might be too self-pitying even for me :-)"

"event","Bit of a weird birthday yesterday. After some consideration I decided to go home for it, and got back late on Thursday. Had a nice day on Friday, just me and my mum, then Eleanor came back on Saturday. We met her in London and went on the slides in the Tate Modern. It was packed, and stressful, and everyone was having endless discussions about whether it was art or not, but who cares when it's this much fun? In the evening we went out for a birthday meal, which was awful for several reasons. Eleanor actually walked out. In the evening she booked an earlier coach back to Cardiff and left at 9am on my actual birthday. I spent the day milling around at home, then spending 6 hours on various trains back to Bangor. It only really felt like my birthday when I was met at the station by my housemates, and we went back to the house where they'd decorated and made a cake, which was lovely. I cannot believe I am 2 decades old. I still feel (and look) about 14."

"event","I have a confession to make: I have been unfaithful to my LJ. I started keeping a diary when I was on holiday, then stopped, then started again when I got back here. It's the only way I have of not forgetting 90% of things that happened any time before yesterday. So here is the other 10%.

Youth hostelling was great, I had more fun than I thought possible. I didn't work to pay for it, various family members kindly donated money for it (to be paid back). Turkey was also good - we went to Istanbul and some island with no cars, just horses and bikes. My dad loved it. Eleanor and I rode a donkeys up an enormous hill with a not-even-close-to-even road. We also went swimming a lot, though not in the sea as it was full of my greatest fear - jellyfish. And I can now say I've been to 4 continents before I'm 20 - we crossed over to the Asian side of Istanbul for a day.

Saw some friends and milled around at home for a week then ajourneyed back to uni. My mother decided to drop Eleanor and I off in one trip, ignoring the fact that we both were taking our entire belongings and there are no motorways in Wales. The trip to Cardiff was ok, though Eleanor felt sick throughout, and cried before and after we left. I was completely shocked by this - I can only remember seeing her cry once since she was a child. I did not cry when my mum left me in Bangor - tensions were high during the painful second part of the trip. She said some things that really angered me but I knew it wouldn't be wise to argue having no escape and no other way of getting there. She stayed the night at my house (which is about as nice as student accomodation gets, btw) then left.

So far it has been mixed. Things were very tight finacially for the first 2 weeks (before the loan came through) - if I hadn't brought food from home I would've starved. Our toilet was blocked for a while meaning we couldn't use it, shower or run water for 3 days. Our landlord is nice though, he gave us a week's free rent for it. I've been getting on with my housemates fine so far, no arguments as yet. And we have a TV (albeit one with bloody S4C destroying Channel 4) and the internet, which is a lot more than last year. Lectures are fine too, at the moment - there is a lot of work ahead but so far they've actually been fairly interesting.

And yet.. I feel awful. I could feel it coming towards the end of the summer but hoped it was just a phase/boredom and it would be better once I got back here. But it hasn't, just worse and worse and worse, and I have no-one I can talk to about it. I finally saw a doctor on Monday, foolishly forgetting how hopeless they are at anything to do with mental illness. I told her I wanted therapy, she gave me a prescription. Which shows that she's not taking me seriously and thinks I'm an idiot - I know it takes 4-6 weeks for this kind of medication to work. So, not knowing what else to do, I saw my new personal tutor, hoping she'd be able to help me academically at least. She told me she'd just recovered from the same thing and recommended a book, ""Sunbathing in the Rain"" by Gwyneth Lewis, which I've only just started but is absolutely brilliant. It was one of the most helpful discussions I've ever had about it, it was such a relief to be able to talk to someone who understands, and doesn't judge, and actually listens - it was exactly what I needed right then. Compare this with the conversation I had with my mum yesterday - I spoke her for the first time in 2 weeks needing help/support only to have her interrupting everything I tried to say with mundane work stories and a quiz night she went to described in excruciating detail.

It's going to be a long year. But aren't they all?"

I was reading the other day that 50% of adults wouldn't pass a maths GSCE - now when I did them you needed 18% to get a C, not sure if the situation has changed dramatically over the 3 years since then. And something like 1/4 would get a G. And yet every year, without fail, there's a constant barrage of people (well, journalists and Conservatives mostly) saying that the exams are worthless and kids are thick. Would they seriously not be saying the same thing if more started failing? Every year it bothers me, every year. Whatever happened to encouraging people to do well? Having said that, my sister got her A Level results last week - 4 As and a distinction for History Advanced Extension. Though of course all the work she did for them had nothing to do with it, she just turned up, wrote her name and that was that.

I can't stop watching Love Island, it's shameful. Well, more the ITV2 spin-off Love Island Aftersun - I have slight difficulties with the actual thing, having to press mute and shut my eyes every time Patrick Kielty comes on. But Aftersun is genius, if it's wrong to love it then I don't want to be right, dammit. Kelle to win."

"event","Got back to London last Thursday. Heathrow was a bit of a joke, understandably. Sofia airport was much worse. We spent 15 hours there, only through our own doing though (long story). Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia were all amazing. Izzy and I bickered occasionally and had one moderate fight, not bad for 2 and a half weeks. ""The issues"" were brought up, as I feared they would be, but only once. So it was all about as good as it could've been, bar the numerous perverts we encountered, but the less said about them the better. I can't really be bothered to type much more, I'm still recovering from it - didn't sleep for 42 hours (partly due to the airport sleepover) and haven't got used to the time difference.

Although he was far from my favourite housemate (Bonnie/Susie/Aisleyne) I'm glad Pete won. Yes the twists were unfair and annoying and yes it dragged on and on so it was actually a chore to watch but I still enjoyed most of what I saw. My only issues would be with having housemates that they themselves diagnosed with mental health problems (Shabaz and Nikki) and including anyway for entertainment purposes. Mental health is never ever funny, and something like Big Brother is just rubbing salt into an open wound.

Edit: Forgot to mention what a relief it is that Glyn's taking a gap year before coming to Bangor uni. It's not a big place, you know."

"event","I can't sleep. Can't really remember the last time I actually did get a proper night's rest - must've been at least 6 weeks ago and it's driving me mad. First of all it's the heat, I can never sleep when it's hot and the precious few hours I do get are filled with bizarre dreams and horrifc nightmares that leave me more tired than when I went to bed. It's not so hot now but my sleep pattern has been suitably messed up that it still evades me.

Anyway. I haven't done a great deal since my last update - half-heartedly looking for a job and watching a considerable amount of TV pretty much sum up the last few weeks. And some of my Welsh friends came to stay for a few days and we went sightseeing. I have to say, I have a new found appreciation for London - we went on a tour bus and it really was very interesting and so educational! There's so much to do and so much history about it, I never knew. We also went to the London Dungeons which scared the hell out of me - the people who work there dress up as torturers and stuff but they take it so seriously it's quite unnerving. They jump out at you as well and it worked on me every. single. time.

Also went to Wimbledon again, which was good again. We were all very excited that Melanie South beat the No. 11 seed (No. 14 in the world) and got to the 2nd round! I don't exactly know her but her dad taught me (and still teaches Eleanor) tennis for years so I met her through that. One of the things I don't like about sport is that people get so involved over strangers doing some sort of repetitive motion over and over again but when it's someone you actually know (sort of) and you've seen how hard they've worked it is different. And I can say I've met the No. 234 in the world! I also have a new found obsession with Kim Clijsters (I can also get involved in sport with people I like), but alas did not see her. Saw Murray though, and Sharapova, and Roddick and even Hewitt (boo! hiss!), it was a good day.

Other news - Eleanor has finished her A-Levels, took and passed her driving test, been to and come back from Corfu and got a job as a lifeguard/swimming teacher at a summer camp. Izzy got in to do Biomedical Sciences at St Georges and has just come back from a 6 week trip to Mexico. I suddenly developed an intense need to travel just hearing about it and I think I'm going to Eastern Europe with her this summer. I have not told her this, but I feel like we're drifting apart a bit. We have different attitudes and opinions to the point where I'm not sure if we really have that much in common anymore. I often find it difficult to find things to say to her when I do see her, so don't know what it would be like for 3 weeks straight. Also the massive fight we had in Edinburgh is playing on my mind - that was after only 2 days... It's more than that as well though. The day before I went back to uni after Christmas she said some very...misjugded things about my...condition which really did get to me, and I haven't been able to open up to her (or in fact anyone) since. I thought things between us were truly done for after that but she phoned me after a month and we had a very awkward conversation where we barely brough it up and I didn't say what I meant to, so she assumed things were fine. I don't think she thinks there's a problem at all, and she sounds very enthusiastic about the trip, and who knows, it might makes us closer again."

"event","Feeling better today, yesterday was just one of those days. I take back some of the things about Big Brother - I don't really think it's just about ridicule/hatred (though there is certainly an element of that). I can claim as a psychologist it's about studying relationships and behaviour, but mostly it's just entertaining. I was just bitter that even after missing the first week I still managed to get sucked in again. And you know, the paintballing and foam party weren't so bad either - I was with friends and we laughed about it afterwards - if I had been on my own I probably would've broke down and cried on both occasions. Yesterday wasn't even that bad a day in itself - went to some park in Pirbright with my mum - we fed the ducks and geese (I didn't want to feed the geese because they were big enough already but was scared of them). And erm..yay about the football..or something. I don't really get sport."

"event","Today is the last day of the semester - I've just had my last lectures for it and am waiting for my mum to let me know what sort of vague time she's coming to pick me up. It's been an interesting term - in some ways it feels like it's flown by and in others it's just dragged. I'm looking forward to going home if only in the hope of getting a good night's sleep - away from the constant door slamming/loud music/smoke alarms/fire alarms/general student drunkenness. Going back to the beginning of the year and the 2 worst exams ever (turns out they weren't *that* bad) the best thing was probably the snow in February which was very exciting - lectures were cancelled we went sledging on bits of scrap metal down the hills (which is as dangerous as it sounds). The worst was probably the work - psychology students have so many more assignments, exams and lectures (seriously) it's ridiculous. Everything in between has already become a hazy vague distant memory. I did go and stay with a couple of my Welsh friends here who live in near Swansea which was fun, though it was the weekend of their humiliating draw with Italy so they weren't very happy. Other news is that I've got a house for next year, sharing with 3 other people. At the moment it's derilict but (hopefully) will be nice and new for next year. Although we saw it yesterday for the first time in daylight - it really is a dump, so I'm feeling a bit nervous about it now. Can't complain though - it looked like we couldn't get one at all for a while (were seriously considering the Catholic Chaplaincy as a last resort) because this evil woman kept us waiting for like a month before deciding girls couldn't cut her precious hedges. Generally this whole uni thing hasn't been so bad - I have had a couple of um...lapses but it's better than I thought it would be and I've made some good friends. After Easter there's only 4 weeks left and then 4 MONTHS of nothingness before I start to panic because everything actually counts towards the degree."

"event","Happy belated New Year and all that. New Year's Eve was the least fun ever. Attempted to go to London to see the fireworks, but all the trains were delayed so spent it on the train. Then everyone ran and screamed a lot to get from Waterloo to the London Eye to catch the last 5 minutes. Oh yes, and I was completely blind drunk from about 8 o'clock onwards, having alcohol for the first time in...ooh...4 years. I was reminded of the reason for this.

2006 has been mostly the same as 2005 so far, though I don't know why anyone expects years to be massively different from each other. Last week I did work experience in a maternity ward. I had been of the opinion that babies just greedy and selfish little creatures that trick you into having them and then ruin your life. But they're actually very sweet and adorable and I found myself wanting one briefly. Advice to the world: never, ever have a Caesarian by choice. A lot of the time I was helping women move after having theirs and getting stronger and stronger painkillers for them. The rest was making beds (hospital corners, how I hate you) and giving baby baths and doing paperwork. Then on the last day I went to new mothers' houses with the midwife and then to an antenatal clinc and felt pregnant women's babies. I still find the baby growing thing weird but not AS weird. See how I'm maturing ;-)

Celebrity BB is kind of irritating this year. I don't like how they all pick on Jodie Marsh, she's too much of an easy target and at least she's interesting. That Faria woman is so much worse yet everyone leaves her alone. What the hell did she do for her performance thing, that's what I want to know. Have affairs with people? Or just stand there doing nothing like the rest of the time. And George Galloway!! Lol. So funny, him just being in there. ""You ain't never gonna be Prime Minister!"""

Christmas was good this year, one of the best I can remember. It was sunny for the second year running though, which was just not right, but it snowed a bit today so that made up for the wrongness. Went sales shopping today from 8am until 1pm - I don't like shopping at the best of times so I don't know why I went on the first day of the sales. It's just asking for trouble. It was ok though - most people were calm and rational for the first 3 hours until it started getting crowded and turned into chaos. And then I went to the car and waited for my mum and sister, who bought the entire contents of 3 shops.

Neighbours was strange today. I don't understand why Frankie - sorry, ""Rachel"" is friends with Bree when clearly she's more Janae's age. The golden opportunity to reunite the members of the Sleepover Club is there, it should be taken!! Today came close - they were in the same corridor, I was very excited but alas, nothing. There are so many ways it could happen - Janae pops over to Susan's, Janae comes over to give that Zeke kid a ""don't mess with the Timmins's"" speech over the Bree thing (btw, how old is he, 8? There is some serious wrongness there as well), school classrooms etc. Make it happen. I have to say though, the actress who played Rosie/plays Janae (Elisha Taylor Cottor or something) is so so so much better in Neighbours. I can still hardly believe they're the same person, except there's this look she gets in both. I probably prefer Caitlin Stasey in The SOC though, cos she ruled in that, still getting used to her in N."

I have been neglecting my LJ, not because of the wild, crazy life I lead but because even when vaguely interesting things happen I forget what they were by the time I can be bothered to get to the internet. And by then I think it wasn't worth writing about anyway. But yes, generally it has been a good first semester of uni, from my already fragmented memories of it. I like most of the people there (except for my next door neighbour...more on that another non-Christmas time, though things will probably get worse with her next year), I like most of the course and am doing alright in it so far and I love Bangor as a place. Towards the end it did get a bit tiresome but seeing as I'm already bored after a week back at home, hopefully it will be all new and interesting by the time I return.

There is a lot more to say but I can't think of it. So on Monday I went back to Nonsuch for the A Level ceremony presentation thing. They read out the A Levels everyone got (only the actual result in the subjects they got As in, how bad is that) as they went up to collect their certificates and where they were now, which was embarassing for me but interesting listening to everyone elses. Was lovely to see everyone again...made me realise though I like people at uni they're not even close compared to the friends I made there.

Other things that happened recently... Eleanor had her interview for Cambridge. She finds out in January but has already got in to Sheffield and Nottingham and has an interview for Cardiff as well so it doesn't really matter. 

Izzy is having quite a few problems. She came up to Bangor about a month ago, which was great, but she told me about this really bad thing that happened a few years ago, that she's only just beginning to try to overcome. And issues with Dave as well, which aren't helping.

Things with R are still great.

Oh yes, and I stupidly went to Oxford Street yesterday. It was like being in a constant scrum, you couldn't breathe, let alone move. And some woman purposely trod on my foot. Like, actually stamped down on it! It was completely insane. Never. Again. I hate London."

"event","Greetings from Bangor! 

Summary of what's happened so far: arrived. Fresher's Week - eevryone in drunken stupor (at night) or hungover (daytime). Thought of leaving. Changed my mind. Started course. Ok so far. Rained throughout. 

I really do like it here, the area is lovely and the people are very nice. Even the accomodation is good, although up the biggest hill in the history of hills. Well, actually, anywhere and everywhere is up an enormous hill - painful to say the least. And it really has barely stopped raining, and people keep setting off the fire alarms at ridiculous hours (2:30am last night, 4am last week) and waiting in it in pyjamas for the fire brigade is not fun. Also disappointing is the lack of sheep and Welsh people, there are a couple (of Welsh people, not sheep) but everyone else is English, dagnabit. God, listen to me whinging on, sounds like I hate the place. But I really don't, I'm not even that homesick - it feels like home/school was a lifetime ago. Although I have woken up a couple of times confused wondering where the hell I was, and because my bed faces the other way at home I smashed my nose into the wall (twice!) as well. I'm going home on Thursday for my birthday - looking forward to it if only to avoid that. 

Anyway, as I said the course is generally ok - it varies quite a lot though. Some of it is so interesting but yesterday we had a lecture on statistics - it was literally the longest hour of my life. There are a lot of lectures as well - 5 hours on Monday and Wednesday, 3 hours on Tuesday and Thursday anbd Friday off. Everything is so hectic at the moment - the only reason I have the chance to write this is because one of them got cancelled today. But alas, I have to go again in a minute to get something to each then a seminar. More on Thursday."

"event","Off to Wales tomorrow (via Sheffield for my uncle's 50th), so in honour of the occasion here are some of my favourite quotes from the best Welsh person of all time, Helen Adams.

""A dove's a bird, innit?""

""I think I'm the only Welsh person in here!""

(On her GCSEs) ""God! How come you lot have got loads and I've only got 2?""

""I probably sound Welsh on the telly""

(As Dean plays 'The Look of Love' with Amma singing along) ""Is that one of your songs Dean?""

(After losing a staring match with Dean) ""I love blinking, I do!""

""Is the jelly cooked?""

(After Big Brother has told the housemates a meteorite has landed in the garden and they have 2 minutes to get dressed) ""Dressed? What, as in clothes?""

""I don't like telling clients (her hairdressing customers) that I teach dancing because they might think I'm being big-headed""

(After Dean told the group how fans stalked memebers of his band) ""I've never been stalked. It doesn't happen in Wales. They're all self-indulged with themselves""

""Is there chicken in chick peas?""

Josh: ""I've had 4 wet dreams. I wake up in the morning covered""
Helen: ""Covered in what?""

Helen (to Dean): ""Can you play the Vengaboys are Coming?""
Dean: ""No.""

Brian (to everyone): ""What if she's (Helen) got an IQ of 25?""
Helen: ""Actually, I'm only 23""

(Asked what laws they would enforce if Prime Minister for the day)
Elizabeth: ""Decentralize the government""
Helen: ""Everyone should be made to wear glitter"""

"event","We randomly went to Paris yesterday. Why? Because my sister wrote on her personal statement that the Pompidou centre is her favourite building despite never having been there and my mum was worried they'd ask her about it if (when) she gets interviewed for Cambridge. It was good though. I thought I'd be in a bad mood all day after being forced out of bed at 6am (haven't seen that hour in a while!) then being dragged around art galleries and museums showing stuff I have no interest in, but really there was some amazing stuff, I have much more of an appreciation of art than before. Though some of it was just ridiculous, like huge canvases just painted one colour or just random spatters of paint (such cases of the Emporer's New Clothes). The other reason it was mostly good was because for once we actually went directly from place to place instead of meandering aimlessly and ending up nowhere which is enough to drive a person insane."

"event","You know what, I'm feeling happy. Yes you read it right. Yesterday was a great day. I went to school for probably the last time ever and it was just really nice. I saw a couple of my teachers (my favourite ones) and talked to them for quite a while but it was more like they were friends, I haven't laughed as much in ages. I had this insane urge to call them by their first names just to see what it would be like but restrained myself, lol. They did give me their email addresses though, which is slightly weird but good.

Some of my friends are off to uni tomorrow (tomorrow!!!). We had a 'last supper' on Monday which was a lot of fun...everyone was close to tears at the end though. It was so different to how Coombe ended, I've made some really great friends. I would be more upset but I know we'll keep in touch and I'll still see them. This is probably a slightly wrong thing to do but the chances of anyone reading this who knows me and doesn't want their uni place shown are slim to none, so here is where everyone is going and what they're doing:

Elisabeth - Art & Education Studies at Bishop Grosseteste
Holly - Medieval History at Queen Mary's, London
Mirella - Computer Science at King's, London
Maria - Psychology at Westminster, London
Myriam - Economics at LSE
Katie - Maths at Cambridge
Jigna -Foundation Art at Wimbledon College
Morin - Aeronautical Engineering at Liverpool
Jo - History at St Andrew's
Sam - Eygptology(!!) at Liverpool
Amaka - Medicine at Cambridge
Kathy - Medicine at Cambridge
Sanjana - Biomedical Sciences at Brunel
Clare - Geography at Cambridge
Vanessa - Biology at Imperial, London
Fiona - Nursing at Brighton
Emma - Nursing at King's, London
Lonnie - Maths at Southampton
Jo - Maths at Oxford
Kirsty - Maths at Oxford
Amanda - Psychology at Reading
Emily - Business Studies at Kingston

"event","Not much has happened. I started packing for Bangor to leave on the 23rd. It hasn't stopped raining for the last 3 days, under the bridge is flooded. My sister is applying to Cambridge to do architecture. I think I'm doing work experience at a hospital doing midwifery with Izzy's mum at Christmas. My mum had her operation, it went ok. And so it goes on."

"event","I am feeling a little better than the other day. The ultra sound was fine, which I sort of knew it would be, which is good that it's nothing serious but annoying because I still don't know what's causing it and how to make it better or at least less painful. Izzy actually came back on Saturday and I saw her most of Sunday and Monday which was good. I didn't really tell her much about anything that's happened here, because compared to what it must be like in Senegal my stuff just is so pathetic. I did see Dr K (and random medical student) though and talked to her quite a bit, but only really told her a fraction of it. She seemed to listen though and increased my medication. I kind of felt like I had to tell my mum this so I did and just said I'd been feeling worse lately. She was a bit upset but it was ok, and just telling her helped a bit. Also I got a bit more much-needed sleep last night which I'm very grateful for so overall everything has improved a little, for the moment anyway."

"event","I really don't understand how you can fool me like that . Kissing me, saying you love me, holding me blah blah . And yesterday you fucking said you loved me again, and what .. Like .. A few hours later you write me a fucking SMS saying that you don't love me at all . Wtf ?! Are you that much of a coward ?! Can't you stand up to me and tell me to my face, that you've lost your feelings for me ? 

It's not that you don't have eny feelings for me, that makes me pissed, 'cause well . You can't control that . But you hide behind your fucking phone ! You can't look me in the eyes and tell me the truth, you fucktard !

When I say the people who really know me, I mean Line, Amalie and Anita . You hold a very special place in my heart, and I'll walk through hell for you ! Thay know that I will always be there for them, no matter what kind of shit they've got themselves into . I don't love a lot of people . But you three are my best friends . I really love you . With all of my heart .

Don't judge me, beacuse I'm not the most social person . You don't know where I come from, and which problems I face every day . I'll pull through with my head up high, I know that ! I have my ups and downs, but I won't let it break me . I have my close friends right next to me, when it all seems hopeless, and it's because of you guys that I don't give up . You give me reason to keep going .

Anita, you and me had our problems . But we got through it, and this friendship can't be broken . Even though I get so fucking pissed at you sometimes . And I know you get really pissed at me too. 

Amalie, you been there all along . You are so close to me, that I sometimes takes my anger out on you . You put up with my shit, 'cause you know I don't meen it . And that's big . 'cause I really get angry sometimes . You understand me .&nbsp;

Line ... Where do i start ? . We haven't had one single fight in the&nbsp;7 years we have known each other . You've been there, when my lovelife went wrong . You've stayed up all night with me, when the phone rang and I cried . You remember . You always has the most crazy ideas when I'm down, and you make me laugh all the time .&nbsp;

I know I don't say this enough .. But I love you . I really do .. And I really appreciate you ."

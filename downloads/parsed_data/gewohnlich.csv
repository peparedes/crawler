"event","i am a model
that of imperfection...
from my lanky arms and unclear skin,
to my untaimable hair, i never win.
my abnormal nose,
my mishapen toes.
how much i really hate my belly,
when it's hot my armpits get smelly :)
my pupils are of different size,
this stupid mouth can't tell lies.
i get awkward with anything formal,
thats what makes me uniquely unnormal!"

so i am sitting here with new york on my mind.  everything in the world is pointing me in that direction, and i don't know if i just wiped the haze out of my eyes, but i am finally seeing it.  the thought of moving there scares me to death...and that is why i need to be there!  just thinking about it gives me goosebumps of excitement."

"event","it's already the 4th day of the new year.  time is going by a little too fast.  i am afraid that if i blink once more i will be a 62 years old man ...my life will have passed before my very eyes and what do i have to show for it besides wrinkly skin and and over-abundance of ear and nose hair?  
i don't wanna be a regular joe who works a nine to five with a set financial income and ""safe"" life.  i wanna do what i want and fail big and when i think i can't go any farther i want to get lucky.  isn't that what lifes all about.  risks and chances?  to me, if i can ever predetermine anything in my life i will be a failure and not living life to all its splender.  as much as i dislike la, i do enjoy the unpredictability of this crazy city.  however i am feeling a little too comfortable and i feel the itch to move on and experience something else.  i enjoy going somewhere completely out of my comfort level and that is when you truely learn to adapt and enjoy.  you can soak up everything and take in what you like and seap out the rest.  and i really don't know what i am saying, or the point i am trying to make, so on that note i am peace-ing out!"

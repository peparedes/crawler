If there is anything I have learned since January it is that there are good and bad doctors. Unfortunately, I haven't just learned this from my own experience with NINE different doctors, but through my grandma's experience too. It almost seems impossible to count how many major problems are going on with Granny. Type 2 Diabetes, coronary heart disease, clinically depressed, bipolar, and the list goes on. But Granny is almost 80 and it doesn't remarkably well for everything that is wrong with her. The point is... these doctors in Marion, North Carolina where she lives have been making so many mistakes with her medications that she almost died this past week. You would not believe the hell that rose when my mother got to Marion. She's been transferred to a doctor in Winston and through the fury of my mother she got her an appointment this morning when most people can't get in for weeks. There's a lot more to this, and a lot of history, but oh well.

In my own world a doctor in Tallahassee who maybe spent 5 minutes with me and then sent his assistant in to tell me what they thought it was (which they had a text book open looking up symptoms) sent my Dad a 300 dollar bill yesterday. I love how my parents don't take bullshit. This doctor put me on a medication that made me almost not function properly and made me gain weight! He thought I had a ""head problem."" So my Dad wrote him a nice little letter on the back of the bill =)

But that's just one case with me. I've been back and forth to doctors since January as most of you faithful lj readers know. I finally had a lot of tests run and when nothing turned up, and doctors at Wake Forest Medical center wouldn't even see my case, I was referred to this woman at UNC's Women's Health Clinic who has a 3 month waiting period. Through my persistence I got a call last week that someone had cancelled! I went to see her and I think I'm gonna be ok eventually =)

But the point is. There are few good doctors out there. And if they are there it's almost impossible to get an appointment as soon as possible. You people should see some of the cases my Dad gets from out of town. People come in because they a dissatisfied with their orthodontist where ever they come from (even across town) and my Dad can't believe what is happening! Some orthodontists apparently just put 4 brackets on the front four teeth and think to hell with the rest of them! Or some people where appliances for years when people in my Dad's office may where them for 6 weeks! Unbelivable. I just admire the fact that he is almost 72, goes to work everyday, and really is interested in helping people with what he does. 

Dr. Cirillo was a good doctor. It's an absolute shame he left this world early. If it were not for him I would not be alive today. He was the only one who didn't write my stomach pains off as a ""viral thing."" If he had that lovely parasite would've eventually wrapped itself around my heart. Crazy huh?

The problem is so many doctors don't want to think outside the box. If you aren't having something common they keep writing you off until you are eventually referred to someone who will not write you off. 

Anyway, that's my issue. My poor Granny."

I'm getting closer to figuring out what's wrong with me, but I'm going to have to have to keep searching to get a definitive answer, hopefully before I go back to Tallahassee. I can't have another semester like last semester. I don't think I can emotionally handle it."

"event","So classes end Aug 3, NOT June 30th as I was lead to believe. Luckily my teachers will let me leave for two weeks to go to Rising Star. I'm going to have to leave a little early though since I just planned this visit to IU... oops, guess I'll mention that later!

Mom's 58th birthday was this past Tuesday! I got her Laura Mercier Au Lait Body Souffle (most amazing stuff!) and an electric chair fly-swatter! So whenever you hit the fly it electricutes them! Jon David and I took the thing down to the barn and had a hay day. We rode around on the Gator and had great Wilkes County fun. 

I finally talked Mom into letting me take Poochie and Baby to the groomers. They have little bows in their hair now and it's SO adorable! She's just afraid they wouldn't be treated as well as we treat them. Speaking of treating your animals well, I can't believe people actually can order puppies online and have them SHIPPED. They're selling them as young at 3 weeks!! We got Poochie at 5 but Dad and I didn't know any better. We realized we pratically had to Mother her for awhile before she would even touch solids. And GET THIS - these pups were going for like $1,750!

Jon David and I went shopping this past weekend and got some great things! Even though I made a dumb purchase in an expensive store and felt super guilty. I refuse to name the store BUT.. I bought the rain boots because they were on sale, but were a size too big. I figured I could wear a thick sock... because I would want a sock when it rained right? Well, they're going back tomorrow. Along the lines to stupid purchases were Poochies dog slippers I bought her. They are these little, fluffly, pink bunny booties that I imagined were look precious on her. Too bad I couldn't even get them on without her scwrimming away! So those went back in exchange for more chewies.

Still not feeling well, but I'm trying to keep my head up. 

So get this. There is this outdoor drama here called ""Tom Dooley."" It's apparently pretty big and draws a lot of money and crowds. Anyway, someone got the great idea that ""The Tree's on the Mountains"" would be a great aria to sing before the show starts or and intermission. The lyrics do correspond to whats going on the show and heck we are in the Appalachain mountains (which every damn yankee and person not from the area cannot pronounce). So I was recruited to sing it! WELL, some bluegrass band that's performing got ""really upset"" that another act may be there as well, so the idea was cut. Bah.

I'm really looking forward to living in Chi O house next year. I really miss a lot of my sisters. It's so hard to stay involved with music and being so involved with it. They are one part about FSU that I really enjoy all the time and I can't wait! I especially can't wait for Kristin's WALL OF SHAME! hahahah"

"event","the finale is on right now and it's actually quite entertaining. I wish Chris and Mandesa were in the top two, bah.

I've been back and forth to Winston a lot for lessons with Mrs. Pratnicki. Thank God for that, seriously. If I didn't have her in my back pocket I would be up shit creek without a paddle. Anyway, Je Veux Vivre is about 2930283 times better. I've started working on some new arias as well as my recital stuff. I'm a ""take the bull by the horns"" type of person, most of you who actually know me realize this. Therefore, when I don't feel things are going as they should I immediately do everything in my power to fix the leak. I refuse to conform to mediocrity.

I started work. I'm at my Dad's office (he's and orthodontist) helping out. Anything they need I basically get it, clean it or organize it. I'm watching his ""real"" assistants so maybe I can learn to work in mouths. That's right! Arian, adjusting braces! MUHAHAH! Shockingly you don't have to have to be certified to do this type of intricate work. This woman came in the office today that seriously had a 4 carat diamond on her finger. That was exciting. I showed some of the girls in Dad's office some SAS pics and proceeded to get sad. I would give anything to be anywhere in SE Asia right now. I miss it terribly. 

Exciting news alert: I got into Rising Star! I know the name sounds corny, but it's kick ass. I really excited. I'll be focusing on auditioning and doing some scenes, coaching, having some lessons with some amazing teachers, making contacts, rooming with Martita (I don't think you know about this yet but Kristin and I talked about it) and Kristin (LUCCA LOVE!) and having a great time. 

What else is new? I guess I've been soaking up small town life again. Ain't nutin like it! It's really is nice to be around familiar and FRIENDLY people. I miss hospitality. It really is so pretty here. I like being close to the mountains. 

Anyway, that's all for now.
I've gotten back into playing tennis. I miss the thrill of athleticism. I played a little bit back at FSU before I came home. Tennis is one of my fondest memories from high school. I was undefeated and had a great time. We were third in state my junior year. The next year (when I was at NCSA) the team won State. What an inconvienient time to leave =("

"event","Well, the jury is up in the air - is my toe broken? or is it not?

Last night the barrel of a hair dryer bounced off of my right pinkie toe. UGH. It really freaking hurts. In fact, it hurts so bad I can't walk on it and am forced to walk on the side of my foot, hobbling. So I got it X-rayed, results will be in tomorrow. This annoying part is I just started working out again! I'm obviously not fat but I don't want to become ""fleshy"" or ""rolly polly"" so I'm watching what I eat and cutting portion sizes. Since this entire semester consisted of burritos, pizza, japanese, cookies, and sugar cereals. Hmmm, we'll see how this works out.

In happier news, I had a lesson with Pratnicki aka. Miracle Woman. We warmed up and worked on my titan jaw and steel tongue for like, 45 minutes. We worked on Je Veux Vivre. I want it to be like pie by the time I audition for grad. I look forward to many more lessons of fabulousness. 

Had coffee with Liz aka The Korean Wonder after that. I miss little Liz - or big Liz now, she's a senior!"

"event","This update will be a mixture of the good and bad. 

The good was my last 4 days in Las Vegas! It was a lot of fun, even though I couldn't gamble. I spent most days eating great good, laying out by the pool (for only a little bit because it was so hot), shopping, and getting ready for the various shows we went to go see. We saw 3 Cirque du Soleil shows - which are the most amazing shows on earth. I think i could watch one of those every week. Other than Dad's snoring, it was a really great time.

The bad news is the doctor, Dr. Cirillo, who helped me get better this semester and the man who saved my life when I had a parasite at the age of 10 died suddenly on Friday. It's really upsetting to me. He was such a good person who helped me in so many ways when other doctors wrote me off. He just called last week to check on me too.

This morning one of my old buddies from NCSA called me and told me that one of my old friends had died in a car accident last night. We were not very close, but still... it's so odd when someone your age dies. You just never know.


That's really all I have to update. Tomorrow I go to Mrs. Pratnicki to become amazing, hopefully."

My GPA for the semester is a 3.75 boosting my overall GPA at FSU to a 3.68. Too bad my grades from SAS don't count. Opera scenes were last Thursday and I was not pleased with my performances. I mean, it was okay... but not up to the level I'm used to performing at. I just don't accept mediocrity and I feel like FSU does most of the time. I could get into this in great detail but it's really not worth my energy - onto other things..

Merlefest was a good time as usual. The drive to NC from Tallahassee was long as expected. Jon David and I went to the Myrtle Beach for a few days and stayed in his condo. We ate Lexington BBQ on to way back and that was fabulous (this BBQ is ranked no. 1 in the world). Tomorrow Dad and I are going to Vegas, he has an orthodontic meeting. I plan on relaxing more and shopping. I'm looking forward to our trip because I don't really get to spend much time with Dad. This should be a good time.

Hope everyone is having an enjoyable beginning of Summer!"

"event","It was on this day when Columbine occured, Hitler was born, and millions of pot heads in America randomly designated today their holiday. Awesome.

I remember the day when Columbine happened actually. I was sitting in Bob Beeson's Social Science class. I sat in the first row on the corner right in front of Michael and Tyler. It was soon after that when all the bomb threats started occuring all across the nation and especially the Great Wilkes County. I also remember this kid in highschool (I can't remember his name) that was always so weird and hated everyone, I figured if anyone would blow up the school it would be him. I would always think about when people picked on him.

So what's going on in my life? SCHOOL. 

Right now I'm currently not doing much which at the end of the semester inevitably means I'm procrastinating. I know I have a French Vocal Lit final, German final (which I MUST get an A on), a Music Tech project and final (which is only worth 1 credit hour and a complete waste of my time), and a French Diction final (which I will get a B on because it's impossible to do well on Trujillo's exams). But what am I doing? Watching Fox news, wondering around aimlessly on Facebook, and browsing eBay and Bloomingdales.com. 

I've been eating an abnormal amount lately. It's really disturbing. Well maybe not a gross amount of food, but a normal amount that consists of nothing but the unhealthiest foods Tallahassee has to offer. Mori's Japanese, El Tatpitio, Qdoba, random desserts, blueberry ICEE's, etc. When I go home I will attempt to exercise (since I feel better) and I definitely will not eat an unhealthy because my mom cooks, which I should really do - but oh well. 

Florida heat is in full swing here and walking the 1 block to campus from my parking lot is getting to be annoying."

"event","Ok, so obviously I've been MIA from lj for a very long time. I'm going to make this trial post and see how I feel about it again. 

While I was doing Semester at Sea couldn't afford to make detailed LJ posts a lot and just mass e-mailed every other country or so. After I returned, I felt like so much had happened it seemed impossible and useless to fool with it. Christmas passed, the semester began and it was hard. The adjustment was unbelivable, so much that it made SAS seem like a dream. I've been sick all semester, some of you may know what's up, and some not. Luckily i've gotten better within the past week. Anyway, it really put a damper on my entire semester and I'm really amazed I kept my head above water. It cost me a lot of emotional and physical pain and I'm glad it's nearly over. 

So - my apologies to my former faithful LJ readers. 

Here's my update in a gigantic nutshell:

I'm not even gonna touch on Semester at Sea because that's just out of the question and I won't undermine that experience by saying a few sentences along the lines of ""OMG it was amazing"" or ""SO AWESOME."" I'll just leave it where it is. I'm happy to discuss it with anyone who is interested, but some things simply don't translate. I'm sure in future updates (if there are any) that it will most definitely come up, and it will the rest of my life. 

I had an excellent Christmas and an amazing time skiing up in West Virginia with my family and Jon David, or just Jon David because my family is Alpine challenged.

Not gonna lie, coming back to school was hard. I delayed my recital because I couldn't get a date and I'm graduating late anyway - so might as well do it in the Fall. I auditioned for Chautauqua. Malas talked to Pratnicki and gave me great comments and wait-listed me. I was pleased with my performance, unfortunately that weekend was the beginning of my sickness. I went to Cleveland for the audition and visited the old school and old friends. It was good time, sort of. 

I've made a lot of good friends within this semester and let go of some old ones. I've worked really hard in my classes and that's something I'm proud of. I did as much with my voice as I could, and I'm content. This Summer I plan on polishing and learning some arias for grad school auditions and other various things, even though grad auditions won't be until 2008. 

Well, there - I did it!"

I saw all my sisters dressed, looking nice and happy, ready to start rushing at the potential new members. I really wish I was there rushing with everyone, why can't I be in two places at once? I really hope I get in the house Spring semester, that would be so awesome! and cheap! All Summer I've been missing Chi O and having a house to go chill at during the day. For some reason (another one of my insecure complexes) I had this idea that no one in Chi O would notice I was missing during rush or that I was studying abroad in the first place. It made me smile with Christina, my big, told me people were asking about me =) That sounds really dorky, but it makes me happy. It really makes me proud that we are the best sorority on campus and we actually care about Make a Wish (our philanthropy) and campus involvement. Maybe that's why we were Sorority of the Year last year. I'm already excited to meet all the new members when I get back in the Spring.

Yes, they scared me - but I eventually got over it. I've had a few really disturbing dreams and ever since, I can't stand to see anything remotely disturbing. I hate it. The previews for that new Exorcist movie made me tear up. I got motivated to write this entry because the preview came on and I had to change the channel because i knew it would just completely freak me out. One of the coaches in Salzburg spoke in a masterclass about what a beautiful thing it is to be so affected by music that you are brought to tears. She said if you're someone who is constantly moved by the music, you are special person. But what kind of ""special"" is she talking about? Anyway - I guess i'll go about being emotional, no time to work on this now - gotta pack for SAS. 

Anyway - I really don't have much more to say. I'm getting ready for SAS, I leave next Monday! WAHOO! I think this might quite possibly be on of the best times of my life. I wonder if it will ever get better than this - probably not."

Last night was the premier of La Traviata with Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon. Unless you are a kazillionaire, you don't have tickets. Luckily, since most people in Europe enjoy opera and the arts, it was televised over public TV! So we watched it in the hotel. Anna. Netrebko. is. amazing. I've never seend anything like it. The set was very modern and the interactions between Violetta and Alfredo were INTENSE. There are posters and add with her in Escada all over town, she is really is stunning. I saw her once from afar, and she was still stunning. And she looks beautiful when she sings too. She, Hampson, and Villazon ROCKED OUT. totally hot.

Lessons with Dominic are going well. I'm going to do ""Quando m'en vo"" for the final concert. He done hundreds of performances of Marcello so I told him he should join me onstage, but alas... he declined. Dominic has become such a jokester with me. Me: I really wanna be a Wagnerian. Dominic: Marry a man named Kyle Wagner (pronounced WAG-ner). That's the closest you'll ever get to Wagner. hahahah. [end convo] What a funny guy. 

I'm getting antsy to get home. I miss my family a lot. I'll only have a week with them until i'm off to the high seas with Jon David. Some people here are really frustrating, or maybe it's just me getting annoyed with 40 soprani around. Nah, some people are just frustrating.

Hampson getting our program into rehearsals, doing a masterclass, Bonney singing Pamina, James Valenti strolling around town, Michael Schade performance tonight, Karita Mattila with Vienna Phil tomorrow night, Cosi the next week AH!!!!!!!!!!! I'm on cloud nine. Now only if Renee and Leontyne were here, then it would be heaven. 

Coachings are amazing. Dorian Keilhack, a conductor at Innsbruck opera is here helping us. I had some work with him and he is very real and very cool. Martita, you FOR REAL need to look into this program. It is exceptionally organized with lots of talent. Last night we had our midterm recital of German lied. I am so sick of singing Allerseelen! The pay off was Cythia Hoffman coming up to me, shaking my hand and telling me I was exceptional. That really meant a lot. Dominic and Dorian were also very complimentary and that made me happy. This girl from Turkey who goes to Curtis, Elif, sang this Mahler lied that BLEW ME AWAY. She is a fierce mezzo. 

Days are crazy long and I am trying to get as many lessons and coachings with everyone possible. In fact, I have a coaching soon - gots to go warm up!"

"event","Went to Vienna this weekend. Very good times. I got caught up in a grunge, chill-rave type scene one night. Totally interesting. Didn't practice at all this weekend. Bad Arian. I took a tour of The Vienna State Opera, really amazing. 

That masterclass I mentioned before was interesting. My name was not posted to sing. I figured since the list had already been formulated that there wasn't enough room. Well, Sylvia Greenberg (google her - totally insane) called me name during the session. AHHH!!!! Instead of not singing I went and warmed up and did ""Deh Vieni."" A girl sang it before me, but her voice was much MUCh lighter. It was a really good experience. I'm glad I can add her name to my resume  =)

I've noticed a lot of the teaching and singers are more conservative here. Even some of the best people here are doing modest things, which is really suggested. Dominic was telling me about how is so frustrating to here undergrads auditioning for grad school with HUGE arias that are all sloppy. He said rarely he finds someone who's voice actually fits. So we're going to discuss audition pieces, because I want to start working on them now. All 3 teachers have suggested ""The Jewel Song."" Maybe Monica's Waltz for my English? We'll see.

Salzburg is wonderful. Dominic wants me to do a masterclass tomorrow, EEKS! He asked what arias I have readz to go because he wants me to work with his ""friend"" that's coming into town. Well, I actually have several that are do-able BUT. I do not want to be looked down upon with my Puccini so I will be doing ""Deh, vieni.""  I haven't sung the thing in over a year. We worked out a few glitches and he said ""You know, this will be just great. Sylvia (the lady who is coming) has sang this role all over the world."" Great. The opportunity is great, lets just hope I don't get crucified. I'm lucky though, a lot of people didn't get anyone they requested and haven't done a masterclass yet :(

We took a day trip to the most beautiful place on Earth, Salzgammerkut. Where the lake country is, BREATH TAKING! I've been having a lot of fun with people, and a lot of people I orignially thought were snobs have warmed up a lot. We've made friends with the guy who owns this Irish pub, so that's where I'm gonna have my birthday party! weee! 

I've finally traded and have my Salzburg festival concerts lined up! Tonight I'm going to see Thomas Hampson with the Weiner Philharmonik. Later I get to see Die Zauberflote and Cosi fan Tutte. Also, this tenor whose name I can't remember, AND Karita Mattila with the Philharmonik. WEEE! I can't wait for everyone to see some of my pics."

So here's what's been going on musically: I'm studying with Dominic Cossa. Google him, he's amazing. I feel like I'm singing for a legend (Chris, you should really look into him - apparently he's the Baritone God). We had our first lesson today. I walked in and he said ""I'm so glad you requested me, you have a helluva voice and I really want to work with you."" Really about pissed my pants. It felt great to hear him say that. I'm really excited and very lucky to even get to meet him. We had our first masterclass today on dramatic interpretation. I found out 3 hours before that I was singing in it. Cute. So I was one of the first people to sing in front of the whole program, lovely! It went pretty well. I got some postive feedback and learned a lot of about ""Allerseelen."" Some of the people here are really snobbish. Jackie and I were talking about how it wasn't really like that in Lucca. But there's like 25 soprani here, and I know they're all talented. Some of them are just a little too competitive for my taste. But others are wonderful and so open, and I love that.  I don't know if anyone remembers me raving about James Valenti (tenor, won Met competition, sang Rodolfo in Rome when I was there, 6'4"", beautiful). He's definitely here singing Traviata with Netrebko and Hampson. Btw, Hampson may do a masterclass with us. He's definitely staying right now the street from Salzburg college (our building). We were at an Irish pub last night and he walked by and I was like, ""th-thh-thhattt. Oh my gah..  tha-tha-thhats HIM!"" It was way cool. Google him too. I get to see about 6 concerts with Salzburg Festival. Cosi and Magic Flute are two. Traviata's waiting list is like, 500 people =(

I've made some good friends. Jackie and Kendall - my 2 Lucca cronies are still around. Catherine is this stylish coloratura with INSANELY high, high notes. She going to take me shopping. Adele, this rising senior in high school was recruited to come here by Cynthia Hoffman at Juilliard. I haven't heard her sing, but I can't imagine she'd be anything less that amazing, and she's super sweet. Other than Adele, the 19 year-olds are the youngest people here. German classes are going well, they're at 8:30 am though, eh. I have a German test tomorrow and I need to rest some.

I'm missing Jon David terribly. It's amazing how the Atlantic ocean intensifies your love for someone. He's going over to my house tonight to have dinner with my parents so they can look over the field programs for SAS since I won't be there. How sweet! I finally talked to him the other day and it was such a comfort to hear his voice.

"event","The time to leave America and fly to Salzburg is quickly approaching. I'm very excited, but also sad. When you are so content with your life and you know it's going to change, even though you know the change will be good, there's always that brief sadness that your good time is coming to an end. 

I had my last lesson with Pratnicki. I was really bummed. I love her and she's helped me TREMENDOUSLY this Summer. We worked on ""Allerseelen"" again because I'm going to perform that at the first sing in Salzburg. She talked to me about Michelle. Michelle was a senior in college when I was a senior in hs there. She was amazing, i'm sure she still is. Anyway, Pratnicki is buds with Marlena Malas (must be nice to be ""buds"" with her) and sent Michelle to her one Summer. She strongly suggested I audition for Chautauqua and said she would write a really nice letter for me. I didn't think I would be ready for such a program now, but according to Pratnicki ""Marlena would LOVE you. She always loves the soprani I send her."" Let's all pray she does, because I would shit my pants if I was accepted. Auditions are held in Chautauqua, NY, Chicago, and Cleveland. I may be making a triumphant return to the dump known as CIM. It'll be nice to see some old friends, and my old teacher. Any other singers reading this that are interesting in maybe taking a hike up to Cleveland around the end of next January, come on... it could be fun! 

Other than that, I'm looking into Rising Star. It's Barbara Honn's program in Indiana. It's only 2 weeks though. Still, I'd really like to work with Mrs. Honn, if not in Lucca, there. I've heard a lot of good things about Opera in the Ozarks. Also, Brevard might be a possible audition. You know, 2 or 3 nights ago I was thinking about how I might just wanna get a job next Summer and take things easy, seeing as I haven't done so in quite sometime. But as soon as Pratnicki mentioned Chautauqua, I got all excited and motivated to work for it. Funny how my plans are so swayed. The faculty at Chatauqua is really intimidating, it would be awesome to work with them. 

I found a dress at BR yesterday that was 50 bucks, it was 168. Yay! Also got some AF shorts for 20 bucks. Sales are crazy right now.

I started packing up clothes and dresses today for Salzburg, sigh. I'm internally really excited, but leaving Jon David is always a drag. I sound so co-dependent, but I know it'll be just fine. I'm gonna have to get used to being distanced, this time together is spoiling me.

<P>Sunday I was told to be at his house at 12 for a surprise. We drove up to the Parkway (Blue Ridge Mtns, for those of you non-NCers) and he set up a picnic for me! It was absolutely precious and so nice. The weather was perfect. He looked adorable. His food was tasty. I knocked over some of our sparkling grape juice like a huge loser. He fed me grapes and strawberries. It was lovely, absolute bliss. We spent the remainder of the day relaxing on different overlooks and strolling around Blowing Rock. That was one of the best days since I can remember. Perfectly wonderful.</P>
<P>Today I had another lesson with La Diva Pratnicki. We discussed the ""Non-negotiable space"" that every singer has but may not be aware of. Obviously I was one of them. Every lesson I learn some new trick that makes my life ten times easier. Thank you Mrs. Pratnicki. I'm becoming more and more serious everyday about going for that Fletcher scholarship. </P>

"event","Before I get to the goods, let me mention my dream last night. I had this dream that I randomly auditioned for the Fall opera. Who knows why - my dreams are very random, weird, spiratic, and sometimes morbid. I was up against 10 or so sopranos. To everyone's shock, Prof. Fisher offered me the shot to understudy the lead soprano role in the opera (even though the opera wasn't really mentioned in the dream, we're doing ""Susannah"" in the Fall, so I assume it was that one). People gasped and I freaked out, i graciously accepted, and then realized I was going on SAS and had a breakdown. Lovely! Anyway...

Today I got a pedicure at a new place here in town. It's another stereotypical Vietnamiese setup. I talked to some of the employees about how I'll be visiting Ho Chi Mihn City and they all got really interested in me. It was nice to actually talk brokenly to the nail technicians rather than sitting there uncomfortably listening to them speak in their native tongue. I now know I can rent a Vespa for 5 bucks, stay in a 5 star hotel for 35, and buy lots of designer stuff really cheap. Great! They also told me to try monkey... no.

After dinner with my parents and Jon David tonight, we were driving through a portion of town that's four-laned (If you're familiar with Wilkesboro, it's right at CVS, Eckerd, and those weird restaurants across the street) going to my Dad's office. There is this crowd looking as if they are waiting on a parade waiting on both sides of the street. Any large gathering in Wilkes usually constitutes redneck activity.. so I was curious. I made Dad turn around and we soon figured out it was a car showing, the unofficial kind. Boy boy boy. It looked like every redneck that had visited Walmart in the past month gathered on both sides of the road. I begged my parents to park so we could watch, because I really find this stuff amusing. Lemme tell you, these people are seriously about there redneck, tricked-out, hot rod machines. Everytime an engine would stir or grumble all heads would turn, including mine. I have pictures, I'll be sure and post soon. My parents refused to get out of the car and I forced Jon David out. Well, I guess it really *was* bad. There was a fair share of Confederate flag paraphernalia, well A LOT. Including those horrible Dixie shirts with bad slogans. Anyway- one i found particulary interesting was this red truck parked next to us with a ""Rebel kid"" license plate and another one that said ""Patience my ass! I'm here to kill somebody."" Charming. My Dad thought it would be cool to ask this random man with yellow, scrambled teeth what all this fuss was over. He said something along the lines of ""Welp, theys bout' to get revved up now. Could start anytime. Overin Elkin they got simlar stuff but they don let em' spin like they do here."" COOL. So I wanted to watch them spin. It was so awesome. You'd watch a family get excited and one of the ""big boys"" would proudly assume the position in his hot rod. Then people would clear out to make way for his entrance onto the road. I, secretly, liked the loud noises. Hahaha. Well after a good 20 minutes of watching loud cars drive back and forth we decided we would go partake in more proper activities, I suppose. Yay Wilkesboro. 

Tomorrow I'm going to Lenoir, Jon David has a surprise and I can't wait to find out! Weee!!

"event","My fourth of July was enjoyable. This is the first time I've been home/near home since I was 7. I spent 8 years at Camp Cheerio doing 4th festivities and then there was Governor's school, then Sound of America, then Operafest, then Lucca, and I'm home now =) Jon David has a wonderful family, I stayed over there last night. 

Sunday we visited the Methodist church. I've had interesting demoninational experiences. I've been Baptist, Episcopalian, and Presbyterian. My parents joined the Baptist church when they moved to Wilkesboro in 79? I believe. Then when I was around 7 the church split over a new pastor and we went to the smaller Episcopalian church. The pastor wasn't inspiring there and the choir director was pretty much a Nazi. Around 7th grade I started going to the Presbyterian youth group because all my friends were there. Eventually I wanted to get confirmed and I didn't wanna join unless my parents did, so they did. Now that I've been away from home a few years, they rarely go. Even though they've gotten a lot more into their faith. They enjoy the Sunday morning services on TV, and my mom doesn't weekly Bible study classes along with a lot of daily study. So where do I fall in? According to my mother I'm in a ""spiritual wasteland."" Lovely. As sad as this sounds, I just forget to pray a lot. She always reminds me to count my blessings, and I always say I will, but I often forget. I really enjoyed the music at the Methodist church. It wasn't anything grand, but it was pleasant. I kind of don't care about demonination anyway. Maybe I should, who knows.

I got home earlier than usual tonight. Watched Jessica and Nick sing on TV. It was horrendous. I love their TV show, but damn... that girl seriously stresses me out when she sings. Who MOVES like that? Every improper physical form of technique you can commit to she did. Her whole body was thrusting! Her jaw was really hyper-extended too, eek. Of course, I know you don't have to have ""proper"" technique singing that genre of music.. but atleast look normal. Right? 

THEN- Denyce Graves sang for another tribute show where George W. was. IT WAS GREAT! It also had Hilary Duff, Jessie McCartney, and other horrendous acts... but YAY DENYCE! Shenadoah was off the hook. 

In other great news, I've discovered something so simple that has improved my singing. It's so mindless. I taped my lesson the other day and about freaked out when I heard the difference. If I just think about lifting my cheek bones and creating a ""higher"" sound, it's like the sound soars into Resonance Land. Yay for this exciting discovery. This also creates a greater sense of ""chiaroscuro."" Mrs. Pratnicki flat out told me that if I were still in her studio I wouldn't be working on Strauss or ""Ach ich fuhls."" I don't know what to really say in these situations. She says the Strauss sounds great and she's glad I'm doing so well with it, but I feel sort of awkward. She knows Cynthia Hoffman really well (Juilliard teacher going to Salzburg) and thinks we'll work well together, I really hope I get to study with her. I have a thing for mezzo's apparently. She also talked to me about Costanza Cuccaro, a soprano at IU that apparently turns out amazing sopranos, (Mrs. P got her MM there) and some people in New York she wants me to look into. I'm seriously debating taking a trip up there sometime next Spring or Summer to work with this lady she speaks of. We talked about Dr. Hoekman actually. They've done Glimmerglass a lot together apparently. She was really excited to know that I've getting diction from him. She was also interesting in his ""North Carolina Songs,"" so I showed them to her. I also learned of a bootleg recording of her singing with Thomas Hampson and Renee Fleming when they were all at Dallas opera, or Fort Worth? I would pay so much money for that recording. She also mentioned looking into the Fletcher program. Which is a full ride, tons of performing experience, great teaching, and major benefits.

In short: I went Blowing Rock with my family, hung out with my nieces and nephew, stayed Sat night a Jon David's, made banana ice cream, went hiking in the mountains (really tiring) with Jon David, Carrie, his Dad, and a couple of his Dad's friends, ate at Cheeseburger's in Paradise, and just hung out. It was a really fun-filled weekend. But before I forget, here is the final list of CD's purchased from amazon.com:

1. Evening with Joan Sutherland - Handel and Rossini works (Rodelinda arias I need to be looking at. This cd was about 7 bucks.)
2. Barbara Bonney - Songs of Richard Strauss and Hugo Wolf (Allerseelen and Morgen are on this)
3. Elly Ameling - Schubert and Schumann songs (for Gretchen)
4. Ruth Ann Swenson - I Carry Your Heart (has Chere nuit and lots of other Romantic songs on there)
5. Jennifer Larmore - My Native Land: A Collection of American Songs (Winter is on there, along with lots of Barber, Ives, Copeland, Heggie, etc..)
6. Leontyne Price - Rediscovered (also has Winter, which Hoiby wrote for her voice, and a lot of her great stuff)
7. Heidi Grant Murphy - Twilight and Innocence (also has Chere nuit, and MANY Romantic songs I'm going to be looking at. This cd was 32 cents!)
8. Alessandra Marc - American Diva (it was 5 bucks, and I love dramatic soprani - so here is this beast woman singing lots of beast stuff. Wee! 5 bucks)

Most of these cd's weren't over 13 dollars. I this the most expensive was the Ruth Ann Swenson one, but I like her and it's ok.

"event","So.. for the last four hours off and on I've been messing around on amazon.com. I originally went there to find some good recordings of pieces i'm doing in my recital. I never knew so many people recorded Strauss. Anyway - so after finding some bargain prices on some essentials (Leontyne singing some Hoiby stuff, Joan Sutherland has a cd that's 7 bucks that has ALL count em' ALL the Rodelinda arias I need to sample) I kept browsing different links that say ""Other listeners of _________ also enjoyed ______."" I've found some great stuff!

If you know me at all you know I have a thing for big, beast, dramatic sopranos. I discovered Alessandra Marc. What a voice. I also found a really cheap CD of Elly Ameling doing some Schubert and Schumann (Gretchen is on there Meg, really good recording - go check it out). I also found this girl, Edith Wiens doing some Strauss. I can't decide, she has a lighter voice. I was going back and forth in my head on whether I *should* get her recording as opposed to Leontyne's or Jessye Norman's... but I just LOVE the richness. Why didn't my girl Renee make a recording of ""Allerseelen!?""  All the Strauss she has recorded is too big for me except ""Morgen"" and like, 2 others. So I think i'm going to get Barbara Bonney's Wolf and Strauss recording. She has a lighter voice but it's not so pointy and I like her middle. 

Oh and Chris - I'm getting something of Beverly Sills (doing the Handel possibly) because I change my mind, I do like her. That Handel aria ""Mio caro bene"" from Rodelinda that Dr. B wants me to look at I'm starting to become fond of. It'll offer a nice contrast to my slow, Romantic, lyrical pieces. The program needs some pep after all. So this is my recital thus far (in random order):

Lee Hoiby:
Autumn
Winter Song

Handel:    
Mio Caro Bene - Rodelinda 
2nd aria? ________

Bachelet:  
Chere nuit

Strauss:   
Allerseelen
Morgen
Breit uber mien Haupt

It doesn't look that long, but we're only given 25 minutes. Probably add a Mozart duet from Figaro or something with Chris.

OK! Back to exploring Amazon. I'll make a post of the final list of cd's purchased. Get excited. I sure am!"

"event","I had a lesson with my old teacher at NCSA. It was really wonderful, good ole Marion Pratnicki always knows her shit. Dr. Brister and I focus a lot on placement and opening up the voice. Mrs. P is such a breather. I did about 15 minutes of breathing exercises before we even started. I felt like my voice sounded much brighter, which is still dark in Arian world apparently. It seems like both teachers are trying to get the same thing out of me: a mix of the ""Arian-esque"" darker quality (according to Dr. B) balanced with a forward, flexible placement. 

It feels so good to be surrounded by good people right now. Everything I stressed about in Tally is but a mere memory. Don't get me wrong, I have some wonderful friends there. It just seems like it's A-OK to be flaky and inconsiderate there. I anticipate I'll chose my friends more carefully when I get back next Spring. I'm just so happy to be at home, around people I love and people that matter. 

I got a B in Intro to Atmosphere, yay!

Jon David is coming over in a bit. He has no idea that I bought him a professional massage! I think he very well may freak out. Poor boy has never had one. I plan on blind-folding him, driving him to my friends office, and then taking the blind-fold off when he gets ready to go in. He's going to be so excited!"

"event","Well the past few days have been interesting. 

I received and A in Survey of Music Lit. HUGE! This is really going to help out my not-so-hot grade in meteorology. But, more on that later. My parents came into town on Thursday to help me move out and to straighten some stuff out with the power bill and whatnot. Chris came with us to dinner and that was fun. My mom and I split a pitcher of sangria but I actually drank most of it. I LOVE Olive Garden sangria! That night I tried to study some more for that stupid exam and pack. Also, later my brother and brother-in-law drove down to help with all the moving.

I never knew I had so much shit. Two full carloads. Mini van and my explorer were JAM packed. With everyone helping it took an hour tops to get out of there. It was magic. It felt so SO good to leave. I was really ready to just get out. The second we were done packing I peaced out. I went to my meteorology exam and about cried. That thing was so damn hard. Seriously, miserable. My ""leaving Tallahassee"" high was totally shot. 

After an Atlanta rush hour, nasty gas station restrooms, and some QT with the parents, I am in NC. It really feels so good to be home. Jon David and I have been cuddling all night and it's bliss. He's staying the night (sleepin in the guest room, lame right?) so I got to tuck him in and sing him a few lullabies before he drifted off. It feels so nice. I literally squealed when we crossed into North Carolina. It really felt so peaceful to see the mtns. 

Tomorrow Jon David and I are going to Blowing Rock to meet up with one of his old friends who happens to be in town. We're gonna drive around the mountains and show him the area. Hopefully I'll get to see my old Camp Cheerio buddy Anna Potter! I'll post pics of the mountains so everyone can see why I'm so attatched to this place. 

I'm sad to leave a few friends in Tallahasee, but I'll be back. I really doubt I'll come back the same person. I have a feeling I'm gonna be quite different after Semester at Sea. 

I'm home! WEEE!! YAY!!! WAHOO!!!"

"event","So in most recent news, Michael Jackson is not guilty. For some reason it makes me sad. Who's to ever know if he really molested those boys or not, but if he did... I really hurt for the families. I remember dancing to ""Black or White"" all the the time when I was little. I also remember watching that concert special in 1992 or so when all those girls were fainting and he grabbed his crotch a lot. I think I get too wrapped up in T.V.

I really like that Nancy Grace show. She's fierce. I bet she pissed, she totally had him pegged as guilty. And that silly Inferno show, I get so wrapped up in it. Like when Abe and Brad were in the Inferno together my heart was seriously racing. I really didn't want Brad to go home. Oh well, I think TV affects my life too much.

These next few days are going to be rough. I have to make a recording tomorrow, finish up a few meterology labs, do my music lit final, do my meterology final, pack, and do many other things. I had to write this really exhausting paper on this Lewis Thomas quote: ""Music is the effort we make to explain to ourselves how our brains work."" Now, at first that seems simple. But, it really isn't. I still don't know if my paper makes sense. 

Friday I will be home in Jon David's arms. Weeeeee!!!"

Lo' and behold they went to WILKESBORO. They were interviewing people at the Brushy Mtn Smokehouse and talking to Swafford about his recipe. I saw this girl Cassidy, a former tennis team buddy. It was so cool. They also showed the creamery and the outside of the place. The also showed the Speedway and Junior Johnson (which I'm not his biggest fan anyway, but I guess you have to have a trademark Wilkes person there). Gah, that was amazing. Too bad they weren't there when my Dad was, that would've been the treat of a lifetime... Derwood Ashworth on national tv.

"event","<P>When I look back over these past few weeks at Summer school.. who have I hung out with? </P>
<P>Singers and a few select instrumentalists who really enjoy singers. During the year I was balancing things out more between some of my sisters, Chi O events, and College of Music people. There are no Chi O events going on and most of my classes have singer friends in them. Even when I'm in Wilkesboro and not around much singer folk (which is A-OK because JD and my best friend are there and I love it) I find that I miss operatic/music world. I get to sing for an hour if I want in my shower which is no luxury I enjoy here for the concern of neighbors. </P>
<P>Every Summer I've done something with voice. I've never been without lessons since my freshman year of high school. Maybe a month or so in the Summer rarely... but never for an extended time. I'm not worried I'm gonna come back to FSU and suck beyond belief (well, not REALLY worried) because I know I will do anything to progress and be better. I'm studying all Summer (here, NCSA, and Salzburg) and will try to study at NCSA again in December. So really, it's like I'm taking a Summer break. Most singers don't really study over the Summer to my knowledge.. I could be wrong though. I'm just worried I'm gonna feel like something is missing the whole time I'm on Semester at Sea.</P>
<P>Some people have expressed to me that I'm gonna be an even better, more knowledgable singer when I get back because I will have had so many different cultural experiences going around the World. I believe this. Of course going on African safaris and mingling through villages in Vietnam will not improve my technique, but I will be more World-ly. And some people say ""Cool! I wish I could do that! But, what about your voice?"" I don't know if people here think I'm stupid for doing it or what. Maybe it just seems like I'm taking a huge risk. I don't know that any other performance major would do it given the opportunity. Then again, some people might think I'm a co-dependent airhead who obsesses over her boyfriend. But, I'm trying to stop worrying about what people think, so enough. </P>
<P>When I decided to go it was sort of spontaneous. It's a great opportunity and Jon David is going. Ok, reverse that order... but whatever. Basically, I'm just scared. Singing has become such an identity for me. I can almost be certain that 99.7% of people on the boat could give two shits that I sing opera. I can't take comfort in my little passion with others who feel the same. I like hanging out with people who are similiar to me, I think because they <EM>understand</EM>. </P>
<P>I really enjoy practicing. I love the release. I like feeling validated that things are easier based on my work. I like exploring new rep. I like feeling great after memorizing a piece and finally getting that tricky rhythm right. The only part of any of this I will have is memorizing and practicing on my own in an empty classroom with a small electroic keyboard I'm bringing. </P>
<P>Jon David thinks it may be a good thing for me to get back to my more well-rounded nature, like I had in high school I guess. It just scares me. I've reached a point where it scares me for people to not <EM>know me as a singer</EM>. To my&nbsp;music friends&nbsp;here I'm another undergrad performance soprano in the College of Music (or the only person to get ""released"" from a choral program. haha). There's not&nbsp;too many of us, so we all pretty much know each other.&nbsp;In Chi Omega, I'm the singer who does classical stuff. To people from CIM, NCSA, Lucca, Operafest, etc.. I'm Arian - the girl they met at this program or school who they probably haven't seen in a long time because she switches school and does different stuff all the time. To friends from Wilkesboro, some people may remember me as the girl who left her senior year to go to NCSA (the arts highschool in Winston-Salem), or the girl who always stuck out in choir because she had vibrato. </P>
<P>I really can't think of many people who don't know me as&nbsp;a singer of some sort.&nbsp;I feel like&nbsp;I'm embarking to&nbsp;become a different person or something. And I'm just scared.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oh, and it's my Mom's birthday. Happy Birthday Mom!</P>"

I never knew I was so loud at parties. I'm also violent too apparently. So my apologies to Jorge and Bergie for trying to kill you! Hahaha, oops. 

Today Chris and I scoured that retarded music library trying to find Baritone/Soprano stuff. I added up the prospective music and it equals around 40 minutes. I'm only suppose to have 25. So, gotta cut back. We've decided the duets are just going to be extra. It'll be fine. I need to figure this out before I go to Salzburg so I know what to bring. I'm gonna take 
""Ach, ich fuhls"" as my aria. It's really starting to sit well. The whole thing is pretty much fine except I have trouble with that little run. That stupid thing is so exposed. But, it should be fine... and I can't think of a better place to study Mozart."

Eileen stayed with me for a couple days. She's gonna study with Dr. Pope and found a cute apt! That's exciting. If I weren't studying with Brister I would probably chose him as my next choice.

"event","Might as well start an update while I'm waiting on Eileen to call me from the airport. 

I flew in from North Carolina last night. Bah. Had a great time, as always. So this weekend...

Saturday the opera ended. It was wonderful, I didn't mind singing in the choir and going to 2 hour long rehearsals so we could figure out the atonal music because I was getting a full ensemble credit. And hey, anything that keeps me out of that choral room at FSU is a plus for me! It went well, Laura (dramatic soprano in my studio) rocked the house. That girl is BEEEEEAST! There's this one part (the choral entrance actually) where she ends her aria on a fortississississmo B-flat and we come in underneath her on a high A, forte as well. It was hot. Yay FSU soprani.

So Sunday I got up around 5 am to go home. I took a sleeping pill around 12:30 to ensure I went to bed. I got up just fine but felt sick, so I threw up. Lovely. Then drove to the airport and caught my flight. Jon David picked me up at 8:30 am with flowers! Pretty Spring flowers. That day we ate with my parents and took a quilt outside to nap in my backyard. It was really blissful... warm, nice, quilt, bookie, me, nap, great. Then we went to visit my old voice teacher but she broke her elbow and was in the hospital! So we drove around on the Brushy Mtn for a while until we came home for dinner with Kristin! Yay! hadn't seen her since January! so that was wonderful. That night we just sat out on the patio by the fire and talked with my parents. He spent the night and it was grand.

Monday I woke him up and we had breakfast. Then we went to his house and just laid around watching tv. Then his Dad wanted to play golf. Jon David's best friend and his best friend's dad were playing so we joined up with them. Well, I sat in the golf cart and drove people around. It was nice being outside. Then I went to dinner with his sister, him, and his Dad. That night we came back to Wilkesboro and watched more tv. 

Tuesday I had breakfast with Carrie and lunch with Kristin. It was great hanging out with them. My parents and I met Jon David in Statesville after work to go to Charlotte. Ate at the Cheesecake factory, then went to the stupid airport. I hate goodbyes. This one wasn't as bad since I'll be back in 2.5 weeks... but still. 

Today was really gross. Bad weather and it was unbearablly humid. I had a lesson. I've fallen in love with this Lee Hoiby song called ""Winter."" It's really beautiful. So looks like i'm going to be doing some Hoiby, Strauss, Bachelet (Chere Nuit, on the CIM alumni CD - LOVE that song!), Handel (Rodelinda). And something else... can't remember. Dr. B and I hung out in her studio for a while looking at music and just talking. (Chris--- she wants us to do La ci darem... so maybe?)

Here is the poem by Wilfred Owen that Lee Hoiby set
""Winter""
T
he browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going."

"event","My mother once drew a picture for me.

One day when I was a lot younger, I had my feelings hurt over something someone has had said... or something else stupid along those lines. So Mom said she wanted to draw a picture for me. 

We sat down at our kitchen table and she drew 3 circles around 1 dot. The dot was in the center, a smaller circle around it, a bigger circle around the smaller circle and the dot, and then an even bigger circle around the 2 smaller circles and the dot. She pointed to the dot and said, ""This is you.""

She then began to make many other dots around the largest circle, farthest from the dot that resembled me. Then she made about 1/3 as many dots on the 2nd to largest circle, then made about 3-4 dots around the circle closest to me. 

Basically she said that when I look back on life, the majority of the people I meet will be one of the dots on the most outter circle. People I consider to be good friends or decent friends, maybe even best friends will be in that middle circle, but will eventually probably drift to the outter circle. Then there will be only a few that are nearest and dearest to me, and those are the ones I should truly value. Then as a joke she attached two dots to me and said it was she and Dad, but I don't think she was kidding.


So obviously I've been dealing with this a lot lately. Sometimes it's hard to identify who is on which circle. Sometimes people that I think are so close are really far away, and it's hard for me to accept that. My friend Ryan made a really good point to me. Basically he said the more and more I keep fretting over every disappointment, every let down, every little thing... I going to eventually drive away the people who really matter. 

I keep talking about this like it's some new thing. Like I haven't had episodes of this my whole life. I guess it's just more present here for some reason. I talked to Kristin for a while last night and that was the best remedy. I haven't laughed with anyone like that in a while sadly. Jon David always makes things easier. 

I remember being in pre-school (Yes, I really do) and being so confused as to why certain people didn't want to play. My mother always taught me to share and I always wanted to share my things. But sometimes other kids wouldn't, and I didn't understand. I didn't understand in elementary school why it was such a big deal that we were moving into the big house on the hill. I would always wonder why my classmates talked about it so much. In middle school I never understood why it was so crazy that I had funny thumbs and why it was still so new that my dad could afford our house. In high school I didn't get why I felt so left out sometimes. Through all these young years I could never figure out why people were so cruel in so many different ways. Even in my freshman year of college, I could never understand why people acted the way they did. Granted things are on a different level now, I still don't understand. I will never understand. I guess i'm just to sensitive and assume people really mean well. But hey, I'm learning more and more about people. And most people simply don't care. I don't want to be like that though. I don't want to purposefully ignore people so I can hop on the bandwagon down here. I think I'll just accept it, and let it go. Sounds simple... but after many conversations I've reached this level. I learned I'm not crazy, maybe a little sensitive at times. I really just need to focus on the people who matter. That's the bottomline.

The other night I bawled like a baby because I was just so disappointed in sad. It's not one thing, or one person. It's a series of things and people. Even things that should not matter, somehow matter to me. I'm so glad I have Jon David to talk about these things with. What a real blessing. 

I went through my buddy list last night and cleared out a lot of people who have apparently fallen off Earth. And hey, it's time to really focus now."

Ok, do it again, it's 4:38. etc. Does anyone else have this problem? Apparently not, because everyone down here seems to sleep just fine. If it's not loud roomates, heat, or someone calling... OR when i'm at home: mom vaccuming, dogs, someone calling... it's just my natural inability to sleep. I would probably get more rest if I threw a sleeping bag on the concrete in the middle of Tennessee st. WHY!??!!?!?!?!?

I got a damn 82 on my stupid atmosphere test. Bullshit. So, before I immediately went into action sorting through extra credit options and new study methods to obtain an A... I first figured up what my GPA would be... WORST CASE SCENARIO: 3.44  factored into my 3.66 cumulative GPA... I would have a 3.61 since this is my 5th semester in college. If I got an A it would only raise it to a 3.63 = not worth it. So, ehh?

As much as I like to convince myself how beautiful it would be to just unleash the beast I must remind myself nothing is worth extra drama in my life. RARRR!!!"

"event","Why do I have no enthusiasm to go out? Some of my sisters are going out to make their rounds with parties and eventually end up at a club... why don't I wanna go? After my last club experience I'm kind of over the whole scene. Man, last year I would've never turned down the chance to go out. Is this weird? I would really just rather talk to Jon David because I enjoy talking to him more than I do getting ready, drinking, driving around to parties, and especially standing in a smoky club with nasty people grabbing at me. I don't like dancing with people anymore, unless it's like PG dancing. That sounded really dorky. But seriously, I feel like it's borderline cheating booty dancing with some random person... unless you're like, really into that sort of thing. Am I becoming old? I seem so lame, but I just don't want to. I don't wanna drink a lot either because I wanna be really fit. I'm really cutting my portion sizes. I haven't gained any weight, I just want to be thinner than I am. 

Oprah was great today. I have to inform my mom about her horrible jeans. You know, the way-too-high, elastic in the back, straight leg jeans... seriously... the wardrobe they had on there looked like Mom's. She needs some intervention. 

There's so much I wanna say to so many people right now, but I just can't. Maybe I'm too sensitive. I made a mistake of letting my feelings out to someone tonight and it just caused a small episode of drama. I should really try to concentrate on the people that matter instead of dwelling on things I think that matter but apparently don't. Makes sense. I was feeling sad then I talked to Kristin for about 10 minutes and felt a lot better. I really need to switch birth control... this kind i'm using is driving my hormones INSANE. I tried to explain to this ""general manager"" at Thagard Student Health center the other day that I've been on birth control since my freshman year of hs for cramps and I realized quickly that I knew more about the stuff than she did! So I've made an apt. with this gynecologist I've heard about in town... he's a MAN!!! AHHHH! Maybe we won't have to do any exam... My mom goes to a man and says it's no big deal, but still. Memories of Lucca... AHH! 

**So if any of you (and I know there are people who do not belong to lj who read this and are on birth control, please comment and let me know) can let me know what works for you so I can go into the apt. with some ideas that would be great.**"

"event","i'm pms-ing like whoa. I have an apt. with the gyno tomorrow, cute. I just spent 6 hours writing a paper on Puccini and analyzing ""Senza Mamma."" I'm now doing Handel, the Cleopatra arias, for my recital. I hate walking across campus in 90 degree heat. I'm starting to learn how to miss Oprah at 4 and still be content with my life. I miss Jon David way too much for my own good. I can't sleep well at night, I fall asleep fine... but wake up to turn over on average 15 times a night. I really like Matisyahu (Jewish reggae guy). My foot feels better. And some people still really suck at life, and I'm okay with that. I teared up today when my atmosphere teacher mentioned something about the fog on the appalchain mtns. My best friend Kristin is back from London, so I can talk to her, yay. Other than that, I guess I'm spent."

"event","Sometimes I get so excited that I'm at FSU. I love the singers here. I love being around very talented people. It makes me happy. I joined the opera chorus of Il Prigonero. That shit is atonal man. High C's and crap jumpin all over the place. I wonder what is in the minds of the composers of atonal music? I don't think they're crazy, I just wonder how they come up with it... what does something so disonant mean to them? Victoria's recital was tonight. Wow, seriously... the best recital I saw all year. One of the coloratura-type singers I've actually enjoyed. She was flawless. For some reason she really makes me proud. Maybe because she's a Chi O, maybe because she's just really darn good, maybe because she's from the Carolina's, but I think it's just because I look up to her really. Anyway, I tried to tell so many people about her recital because it's Summer and I just really wanted a lot of people there. Without my efforts, there were plenty there.

I've been disappointed in people lately. I don't understand. I always feel like I go on and beyond to be a good friend. I enjoy it. I like feeling helpful, I like hanging out with people, I like friendship. Especially people who are ""designated"" to be my friend are just failing at the concept. It's hard going home to friends you haven't seen in forever and just picking up all the pieces. And then with others, it's like the pieces just stayed together. It makes me sad sometimes to think about the many friends I've grown distant with. Even still, I try so hard to keep in touch and sometimes my phone calls just don't get returned. And I just can't help but feel sad about it. And I have great friends, I'm so thankful for them. Friends that I know will last a lifetime. And really, Jon David is such a good friend if you want to look at it in that way. If you take away the relationship, he is such a good friend. I can tell him anything... even if it makes me look weak, insecure, or just plain stupid. I'm happy he listens and doesn't judge me. 

In less pensive news, I need to start using a thesaurus and proof-reading these entries so I can sound as elegant as Chris in his entries... haha. I picked out the Strauss pieces I'm doing in my recital. They are so hot. And Strauss is the best thing EVER... EVER!!! I want to email Marilyn Taylor from NCSA and ask her who wrote those Appalachain Songs she performed when I was a senior. Those were awesome. I think I'll go do that now."

"event","in most recent news my foot feels like it's falling off. Well, maybe not THAT dramatic. But, it has been hurting badly. I got it all diagnosed today about FOUR HOURS in the doctors office. I went to one doctor, didn't feel comfortable with his assessment, so I walked across the hall and waited till all the patients were done in the others doctors office. Thankfully, he was much more qualified.

I'm back in Tallahassee doing the Summer school thing. It's not so cute, but do-able I suppose. Some good friends are around so it's nice to hang out with them. I'm taking survey of music lit, intro to the atmosphere, the lab with that, and voice lessons. Ummm woo? No? ok.

Other than the foot thing and missing my bookie terribly, things are alright. My theories on odd people in Tallahassee will never change, it has been recently confirmed. This is suppose to be my major, kick-ass workout get in shape tone up time, but alas... i could barely walk this morning. 

At the tail end of my time in NC I had an amazing time. Jon David went with my family to have some fun at my Uncle James' 100th birthday on this awesome gazebo type building on Lake Tahoma. It was lot of fun. I got to spend a bit of time with my grandma, who has been really sick all year. Thankfully she's doing better, really gave us a scare there for a bit. Sunday our families went out together for Mother's Day up in Glendale Springs in the mtns. It was so fun, our families are a lot like. It's always a comfort to know the guy you love has a good family =) Shortly after I was wisked to the Charlotte airport to make the flight back to Tallahassee. Woo? No? ok. I remember thinking earlier in the week that I would not cry this time when I left Jon David because it will only be a short time till I see him again. Well, oops. I can't help it. I love him too much. 

It seems like alot of Dr. Phil and Oprah have been on cheating husbands, infedelity, and hidden pasts. So I have developed a theory based on these viewings. Based on what I know thus far in my life, if one has been married x number of years and has the ability to have an affair on someone they are: A. happily married to and B. haven't had fidelity problems in all of their x years of marriage, you have to question how much the really cared about their relationship, spouse, soulmate etc. Seriously, I cannot IMAGINE myself cheating on JD and we've been dating... 6 months? I have enough trust issues as it is. I would NEVER been able to trust anyone who had screwed some other woman. How can these wives just accept it? Guess I haven't been in their position so it's hard to tell. But seriously... there have been way too many shows on it recently."

"event","I'm in Raleigh right now at Jon David's apt and he's asleep and i'm bored. Humph! But eventually he will wake up and I will force him to take me to get food. I would go get it myself but I can't drive his straight, blah.

So the past few days have been fun i suppose. Didn't do much monday except get my hair cut. That was fun. Yesterday we went shopping. I got some Bobbi Brown tinted moisturizer and this under-eye brightening concealer. That shit really works! I also got some khaki shorts from Abercrombie and some new jeans from Lucky. I'm pretty sure thats it. But I think we're gonna go to another mall today sometime =)

the last night we met up with Tyler, Michael, Tyler's gf Shannon, their friend Prashant, and Kent for dinner at Carolina. I love Carolina. I kick myself often for being a singer and not going to college there. UNC is really the best university there is.. and the most beautiful. Why did I not go there again? Oh right, the whole opera thingy. Any who--- dinner was wonderful. I love those guys so much!


ok i think i'm going to wake him up."

"event","So I've been home since Tuesday and life has been wonderful. Mom picked me up at the airport and we went to The Cheesecake Fac. This is a luxury I have been missing terribly in Tallahassee. I stayed in Wilkesboro that night and drove to Raleigh the next day to see Jon David. What bliss. Of course being with him was wonderful as always.

Thursday we drove back for Merlefest! Yay Merlefest! Loretta Lynn sang that night and we just sort of walked around. Friday we walked around the whole festival; browsing crafts, listening to different artists, messing around with instruments, people watching, eating from the tents, and seeing old friends. We saw Donna the Buffalo, King Wilkie, David Holt, Bela Fleck and his trio (which was amazing), and lots of others. Sunday Alison Krauss sang which was great of course. I saw some old friends which was nice and I bumped into some people that I would've rather not seen, but, all was well. I've been really tired this weekend, so Merlefest was exhausting. I'm so lucky to have something like that a part of my heritage. I love listening to the lyrics of some of the songs, a lot of it is very historical. Like I said before sometime, bluegrass is God's music. hehe. Oh yeah, Jon David and I also danced to some honky tonk group for one song, haha. I'll post some pics later.

This week I'm gonna spend in Raleigh with Jon David, which will be a good time of course. I should be visiting some old friends, so more later."

I Fucking Love Band Camp!

</b> </font>

we finished learning Conquistador (<-spanish disco) Charts, started Incantation (<-driving middle eastern groove) charts. It was epic superhero day today. I wore my WHAM! halter top, my green cargo shorts, my tan belt which had a sheeth attached to it for a plastic sword i bought at busch gardens. Me and lindsay totally unsheethed our swords all day and mocked that first scene in romeo and juliet.

""do you bite your thumb at me, sir""

oh dear jesus. and i totally chilled with tim in his dad's place (his dad lives across the street from the high school). We watched the end of the price is right and joked and ate. Pat, emily and jake arrived later on, and the boys played some killer computer game and emily left. We then watched some of The Young and the Restless... and joked. I &hearts; tim. AND I SAW BEN-JAMMIN FUCKING LANNIN. Tim's oldah brothah. He's so awesome. Its sad he graduated. I miss him. and his... crazy freakin hair. 

well. Day two and i feel sun poisoned. Actually i felt a little more nautious yesterday, but today my throat is really fuckin dry and it hurts to swallow so i think i'm gonna go with today as being a bigger thumbs <b>down</b>.

Ahhh."

"event","So.. life has been basically boring so far...

i hooked up my aunts sewing machine and sewed up some clothes... i've talked to some people online and established with ryan that he does in fact love me more than lindsay, furthermaking me want to vomit everytime she goes ""oh i'm taking him to rocky horror"" or ""oh me and ryan hang out all the time""... out of his own mouth, he bitched at me because she's his only option because i dump out. Which put a big ol' smile on my face. man i'm a bitch. i've cleaned. Talked to Stephanie Morris on the phone. <img src=""http://myspace-001.vo.llnwd.net/00140/10/01/140261001_l.jpg""> me and steph there for a visual! :)

and then last night at almost 6,  Chris Howard shows up at my door with the usual Chris Howard expression on his Chris Howard face. He just lets his lower jaw hang open and his mouth like ovaly... and it looks kinda angry but he's not, its just his face. So this is what happened.

""Oh hi Chris.""
""Come on""
""umm. Where?""
""I'm dropping you off at the basketball game""
""I'm not wearing a bra""
""Well then take a minute and go put one on... maybe some shoes too-HURRY!""

and i just laughed all the way up stairs and all the way to the game as chris explains to me how he fucked his finger up. At the game i caught up with some friends... then caught up with the mark... of whom i basically needed to talk to mucho. and we did. and. . . . . . man. 

but all is well in the end. 

and now for Canobie lake park. The place where my right titty definately fell out of my shirt in front of everyone for a good 20 seconds ish. :)

awesome.

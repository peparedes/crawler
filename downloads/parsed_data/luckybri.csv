"event","I am in love. I LOVE Madrid. Cadiz was a beautiful little beach town with NICE SPANIARDS, but  I love the hustle and nightlife of Madrid! It is official, i am an international traveler and have a feeing this is going to be my new addiction! After spending a few more days here we are going to slow things down in Sweden. It is a nice dynamic to my trip- busy nightlife to relaxing days. I am a little nervous to try all the swedish food that sara told me i have to taste! Oddly enough though, i am excited to try some octopus!! I have a week and a half left in Europe before i come back to the states before summer school so i am living up every moment. I feel like i have readily adapted to Spanish life: sleeping in until 1230, eating a lot of good food, siesta (nap time), eat more food (dinner is around 9pm) and stayin up until 6am indulging the nightlife! Life is going to be hard in the states hahaha!
I love my life!
Ciao! Hasta Luego!"

IM not sure though, I have also decided to get my tongue pierced, but figured I should hold off on that until i know about surgery. That will mean i will have nothing left to pierce and will be done. wow, weird. I will actually join a normal workforce ina  year or so and have to abandon my once loved pieces of metal. hmmm. weird concept. I cant wait to be done with school! Bring on senior year baby!"

"event","I had a fabulous weekend... including the 3 days drinkin binge. THursday Tara and I decided to celebrate something.. I believe it was either our test scores or the fact that it was thursday. ANyway, had a nice time that long night that I cannot disclose on this journal.. teehee. Friday night= PIke FIght night! Front row seats, ringside! These guys were crazy! Some of the fights sucked, but of course there were the hot frat boyz beating the shit out of eachother.. HOT! THe ring girls were all cut outs too.. i have to admit a little dissapointed in the soroities! ALL of the Ladies looked IDENTICAL! ANd when they tried to ""shake it"" there was nothin. That was interesting. The best fight had to be when there was this nice punch and blood and sweat flew like ON THE ANNOUNCERS. I have to admit, it makes me want to box.. but i know i would be upset if something got fucked up.. like if i had a crooked nose for teh rest of my life or soemthing. GOOD TIMES! GOt Drunk afterwards.. went to a couple of parties only to end up walkin with Tara, Kevin, Armando and some Jewish guy. Ya, i dunno. ALL I have to say is THANK THE LORD I HAVE WONDERFUL FRIENDS. I dont remember how i got home that night. Ya, not cool. Saturday came around and after volunteering at the hospital we planned a slumber party with teh AS crew. THis slumber party consisted of eating, talking shit, and some old school games. For example, MARSH. My fortune told me that i would be married to Finch (dont ask) with 5 kids living in a Mansion in Nevada with a White Tiger. THe catch is: I would have a motorized Tampon as my vehicle, I was deaf and I was xavier's slave!! AHHHH! I love being a chick."

I was going to go to Washington to eat a hotdog on the space needle and play in the rain, but instead i had to committ to some family loyalty and aid my sister in her recovery. When i spend time in teh grove i jsut get so depressed. Mostly, i feel like people lose their power in good ol EG. I think people forget that they have control over their lives and if they arent happy they are allowed to leave. In a nut shell, my vacation was not a vacation. I was stressed runnign around trying to get my passport and car things together. I didnt sleep in, drink, sunbath, or take a hot bath in the middle of teh day! DAMMIt. I am a little bitter that my badly needed break turned into a stressful trip home. So, i am on my way back to sunny SB to try to make up for the past week.

This weekend was nice: partying in the rain, actually being productive and shopping in Ventura with money I dont have. tee hee. I am so excited to start traveling soon. First on my list is Washington for spring break to go visit allie and the kids! Then July 1st going to Madrid, Espana to go see Sara!! I think I might need to brush up on my spanish so when I am in a foreign country at least I can ask where I am in case i get lost. :) I hope we travel to Italy, England, France and of course Sweden! Fortunately, my layover is in Dublin, Ireland so i am so excited!! It is just a pain in the ass to get everything together (ie passport!!!) I also want to go to Mexico sometime soon (Marchish) and partay it up in Rosarito. Thats all up in the air though. 
SChool is also doing wonderfully as i scored a PERFECT on my midterm... as ofo right now i have 2A's and a C that I hope to bring up this THursday. I feel motivated to take 20units next quarter to graduate on time. I know I will be walking for S07, but Ill have to go to summer school. I cant believe that I am graduating college in a year! AHHHH ... I think i am going to go live in a different state for like a year to work and chill, take all my tests for grad school in that time and pay off some loans! I really want to live in Oregon or Nevada.. or maybe go as far as the east coast. is anyone willing to go? :)I am still thinking about joining hte Navy despite the war and constant Berating by my mother. I wouldnt mind ebing a soldier and becoming a dr or RN through the military. But, it's just an idea.
Love life is gone. I have vowed to be virginal for at least 6 months and not get into another serious relationship for quite a while. I just need to filter out my muddy water. (sara are you proud?)

I have ONE job that is way chill, a third year at good ol UCSB with a major I am about to declare, with the love of my life and am in love with my place: no more psycho roommates!!  Summer is really treating me well... even though I am still surprisingly white as hell! I watched ""Tragdor the Burnenator"" the other day, if you havent seen it: www.homestarrunner.com... really funny. I think its under dragon.  any who lah lah...I have come to realize that I have made life too complicated, it is so hard for me to really just listen to MYSELF. Fuck what other people say, ya feel me?  I ultimately know what i want and how to get it. Life is good.  ps. why are so many people doing drugs? whats going on with that? hmmmmm?"

I forgot the books i should be reading right now for my final on thursday so i have been wacking off at work.  tee hee.  the end of this year has been really fun, especially with the new roommate.  im having a BBQ manana with good food, good beer and good friends.  wow, i said good a lot.  im almost done with finals!!! thank goodness.  i went swimming lastnight and realized that i need to get back into that for sure next year.  goal this summer: buy a surfboard.  goal this next school year: try just a lil bit harder (i have high expectations for myself) and travel to spain and england to visit my best UCSB friends. that should be sooooo fun! so, this summer my plans consist of my taking one stupid GE class, working full time and going to the beach.  what a hard life.  im hoping to go visit KT and Carla as they are going ot be down south.  sam said she wanted to come visit- that should be interesting.  i am moving into my new place sometime this month- finally leaving my fucked up roommates!  i guess im looking at the right signs.  hahahaha. hope all is well with everyone! love"

I've been trying to have more patience in my life... they say patience is a virtue... one that i dont possess i guess.  i keep looking for happiness, when all i need to do is look around me and realize it is right in front of my face.  i think i am trying to set myself up for happiness next year.. but it could turn into disaster for all i know.  im not sure what im doing.  carlos grinds his teeth at night.  i firmly believe there are some things you should never lose sight of and i know what those things are.. which have kept me sane.  i wish someone could run my life for me and just tell me what to do.  i know there are signs all around me, but am i reading the wrong ones? ahhh... next year is going to be interesting.  i just hope that i kick my own ass and raise my gpa for grad school.. i may graduate early, but do i want to? i hate money.  money ruins people, it ruined me.  there i go again.. to much on my mind.  i had a lot of fun tonight, carlos and i went over to the girlz house and had tacos with ruben, jess, eva and ang.  good times.  its giong ot be so weird here without them.  ::sigh:: my room is a mess and i have to write a paper due tues morning.  what a drag. i need an A. shiet."

"event","ALright, well sara hella bitched me out for not updating my damn LJ so here i go sweetness... ok so as of now, my life consists of going to school full time and working full time.  i got a second job working at alberstons as a checker and its actually fun.  i recently dyed my hair a really dark brown and now a lot of poeple speak spanish to me at work... ahhhhh!!! but its kinda full because i want to get fluent and i can practice a lot at work.  other than that... nothin has really changed or happened. 
my housemates are a motley crew let me tell you.  first there is Kassie, which kt, Diego and others have met... so is so loud, but its hilarious. and, she wants to fight everyone which reminds me of sara.. hahhahahaha... then there is Soren who constantly needs my attention.  i will be sitting some where preocccupied with important things and he comes up to me and just bugs me.. like he will put a picture or something in front of my face and just act like an annoying little brother... people think its really funny, but it is kinda weird that we both feel like we have a big sister and younger brother relationship (mind you he's older than me).  then there is Paul.. o goodness paul... he recently joined a Frat and so for the first week or two he came home covered in puke (from initiation) and so drunk out of his mind we felt like one of us had to be home when he gets home in case we need to drive him to the fucking hospital.. hazing is a bitch. dont worry, i videotaped his ass.. another interesting thing about paul is that not only is he not the clean freak like i thought he was, he's actually the opposite and likes to wear my clothes around.. ya, thats right, he walked by me wearing my swim team champs shirt 2002... (carly, you know what im talking about, you know he didnt go to LC.)  
my love life is good as i am in love. cant complain about my relationship and by the looks of things everything is going according to plans... future developments.
Allie update:  she is so cute!!! she is 6 months now and loving every second of it (except that her husband is now in Korea.. shitty) Lil John is hella good ... hes in kindergarden now and doin well.. reminders for all of you who want to attend the babyshower its going to be after christmas afterall.. roxanne couldnt make up her damn mind... so, just FYI and it will be at their new house by franklin HS.  shes going to be so big because she is due around her bday (Jan 27th).  im predicting she will be in labor on her 20th bday.. that would be hilarious.  i cant wait for my lil nephew to be born!! YAY!!
other exciting news: sams baby (Brandon) turned one this month.. how presh.  hes blond with like greenish blue eyes... hella cute.
HOlloween:  ok, so i am aware that i am going to be having a lot of visitors and i love it, but the thing is, i cant afford for all of yalls alcohol problem.. so, i think im just going to buy like 100+ beers and like a handle and everyone throw down? what do you say i need some input here people! :)
i cant wait for this weekend! it will be exciting.. all i can promise all of you is a piece of floor because we are probably going to have over 20 people spend the night.  paul informed me that he will have between ten to twenty of his own.. so, shiet.
Family is all good.. my sisters might come down for my bday...only a few more weeks and im the big 19.. i wanted to go skydiving for it, but iit is really expensive, so instead i might just settle for getting shitty and Kassie throwing me a shindig. i will wokr out skydiving late.r. any takers?
in short, that sums up my life currently right now.
let me know about holloween and babyshower shiet.. hit me up on my cell.
love"

YAY! rache hella stressed me out on sunday when she calls me and tells me we are going to leave in 30min out of the blue!! ahhh!! fortunately, we left at 7am on monday and got back so i could write my paper and all that good stuff. im so glad that this is the last week of school. i have one paper and 2 finals to go! after today, only 2 more days of summer schoola nd then i can relax and not worry that i should be reading something. so, steph is sick and i really hope that i dont get it b4 my family vacation.. that would suck. she is supposedly moving out today and we are looking for a roommate now. who knows.. the possibilities are endlesS?  well, i know that this week should go by fast. wow, this lady outside isnt taller than the broom she is holding. weird."

Last weekend (starting thurs) went to Malibu to go visit mah girlie Sara.  friday was fun filled with swimmin the the ocean only to have a sea creature still not identified rub up against both of our legs.. it felt like a doormat. then we attempted to go to the big rock during high tide because we are geniuses only to get thrashed around by waves.. hahaha.. its ok im a lifeguard? we kicked it that day and the real fun started at night.  after killing a few swedish drinks and a bottle of chardonney, we went skinny dipping in the ocean and a spa on the beach.  let me tell you: through almost losing my swim suit and life to a huge wave we decided to head back and crash.  saturday was a beverly hills day. we went to a baby shower that had valet parking!!! ya!! how rich can you be.  so, sara and i fully raped the party of mimosas, bloody mary's and great food.  it was really cute.  sara, can you not flirt with the man serving orderves? teehee.. sunday we went swimming and saw a family of dolphins and a sea lion playin together.. it was precious. i wanted to go and swim with them, but then i thought that that is kinda strange.. hahaha. we went to venice beach and there are a bunch of odd people there.  we also decided to get pierced... yes, again. sara got her tongue done and it was crazy because the gyu fucked up at first and so he had to DO IT AGAIN!  AHHH!! i took pics. :) i got the bottom of my bellybutton done. so now when you look at it, its like three dots in a row because the top one has a huge diamond thingy on the bottom of it. its tight.  so, after many episodes of sex and the city and deep conversatoins, i had to come back to SB. 

then of course, i had to have something medical go wrong.. well, i guess i cant really say that because i have been healthy for a while now thank the Lord.!! so, i woke up monday and realized that i couldnt see.  not blind, but everything was just really really blurry... i couldnt even read something. i got all wigged out and i felt like iw as going to vomit, and faint and this all lasted about an hour or so. i went to the dr because otherwise my grandmother would have slapped the shit out of me to find out i had an optical migraine. ive never heard of it but it was brought on by stress.. dammit. so, the dr told me to deal with my shit or else ill keep having them.  maybe allie is right... counseling??? drama drama drama. the rest of the day was good, went to class and lab and slept the rest of it.

all i know, is that i cant wait for my family vacation so i can go jet skiiing and swimming and tubbing and water skiing. two more weeks. note to self: dont take summer school!!"

Heard from carla - but we just ended up playin phone tag. saw my gramcracker and grandpappy... they are good, but its so hard to leave their house sometimes! they know how to talk.  saw my sistahs. Melika is good, and even was complacient with a money matter. Kendra bought a Beemer that weekend and its sweet!  i find it weird that all 3 of us bought new cars this summer.. rollin in a Lexus, BMW and Civic! represent! today has been quite busy and ive come to realize that i have a bunch of make up work to do.  o well! i also realized that being poor is not fun.  eating chips an salsa for dinner is not what its all cracked up to be.  on a good note, after thursday my car will be in my name and im holding the pink slip, i got a B on my chem midterm and im plannin on getting an A in comp lit. YAY for me! this weekend should be fun too... going to Malibu and kickin it with my girlie sara.  living the high life in beverly hills for a day and then lounging on the beach.  my life is so hard. hahaha on another good note, been reading the bible and am being really inspired with a lot of things i havent thought about for a while.  its a good day to be alive."

today has already been rediculous! i spent 2 hours of my morning getting my breaks fixed only to have the guy drive me to school because i was goign to be late for school.. .yes, all this happened between 730 and 930 am.  went to class late, not goign to chem, going to tutoring and then working.  the guy hit on me... hahahah i already have a man thank you very much.  can you not be inappropriate?  speaking of my man, goign to EG this weekend.... some unfinished business to attend to and yes, him.  i dont need an excuse- booty is a wonderful thang.

"event","Sunday I came home and unpacked all my shiet.. i drove 4 hours and was a little tired.  Saw Arna, Steven and Jessica Zim that night.  

Mon: lounged in the sun and swam in my pool.  Had to do things to secure some jobs.  Got 2 jobs, but they both dont start until July.  

Tues: Started my swim lessons with my little kids.  i get $10 a lesson (30min).. not too bad.  Saw Trisha and baby Natalie (she is so cute running around and cooing).  Joanna and i sipped on some drink that night.

Wed: STeven, Andrew, Ryan and I all went to Santa Cruz to go surfing. the only problem was, there were no waves.  DAMMIT.. but we still had fun.  we went on the Boardwalk and road some rides, went on the pier and i swear to GOd i thought Andrew and Steven were going to puke from all the junk food they ate.  had a 4 hour drive home because every freeway i took had construction... was so pissed and irritated by the end of the drive.  Owelll, went to In and OUt and got a protein style burger. (you should try it)

Thurs: Went to the movies with my gramcracker and saw Troy.  it wasnt as good as i thought, but dammit Brad Pitt is hot.  Damn you Jennifer Aniston!  Had a swim lesson, helped Trisha pack because she is leaving for Colorado with her husband and kid.  spent the night over at Joanna's and drank some more.

Goal of the day:  try to find a new car so i can hurry up and buy that shiet.  Go to Roseville and go shopping and see baby Brandon."

"event","WEd. went to the doctor because I thought that I was coming down with strep throat again.  Had to have a throat culture and a blood test and the bitch doctor couldnt give me a diagnosis.  she said that she would call me then next day and never did.  what really irritated me was that i told her i had a final @ 4 and my appointment was at 215.  she said no problem, but i got out of there @ 340!  AHHHH.. so i rushed with Sara to our last final in Human Sexuality.  While i was taking my test i heard a lot of noise and then all of a sudden about 20+ naked people run in screaming!  it was the most hilarious thing i have ever seen!  so, after that, it was REALLY hard to focus and not just start laughing.  I think i did ok on my last final for not studying @ all!  Sara and I celebrated by going out to dinner @ Alcapocos and having a margartia.  i love fake ID's.  

that night a lot of people in the dorms got rolled... stupid CSO's and RA's who call the cops.  fuck them. 

Thurs.  Worked in the morning.  went to Goleta beach and lounged around. Ran some errands and then went to State Street to take advantage of Nordstroms sales!  came back and drank with Sara and Angela.  talked to arna, andrew and steven.. and now excited to come home.  i miss everyone!

Friday (today): sara left and she was hella crying.  awwww... im going to miss that bitch.  I am currently working an 8 hour day and its so boring.  but, on an optimistic note, i finished my photo album!!!  HOORAY!!! and im getting paid!!  HOORAY!!  Going home and packing up everything and then going to Christina's Partay. YAY.

LET SUMMER START"

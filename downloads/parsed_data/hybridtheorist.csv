"event","Last night was definitly a very good experience. A unexpectedly good jet li movie, kicking up my feet on some ddr, three epic games of air hockey, overall a nice night on the town with some awesome people. After making to to bed at 4:30 last night I slept until about 1:30, which was very nice. I woke up already sore, but I promised my dad I would help him more on the deck, so I was out there for a large portion of today. I thought I was sore before that, not I'm pretty much dead :( Tomorrow is the day of recuperation. Amazingly I was out in the sun again today, and I haven't burned to a crisp, I might even be able to actually tan for once in my life! I find myself again up until 4:30, which is probably going to kill me on tuesday. Off to dreamland for ben, and just a little more decking tomorrow, if I'm able to function. Goodnight live journal."

"event","I just got done helping my dad with our deck, which took about 5 hours today. It's not done, but it's a start. I was digging post holes with our post hole digger, which really starts to wear you down after a while. I'm so pooped that it's time for at least a little vegetation, and some food because I'm starving. I hope I will be able to get out of bed tomorrow."

"event","Well, it's the first of my four days off, and I really don't have anything to do this weekend. I'm going to help my dad with our deck I think, but other than that nothing yet. I'm thinking about going to see sin city tonight, but going alone to movies is kinda sad :-/ Anywho it's time to lose this mess of hair on my head, to the barber I go."

"event","Well, this weekend has been a very interesting one indeed. Thursday night was my day to relax, and just chill before the rest of the weekend got crazy. Friday I went and saw episode III as well and kingdom of heaven which were both awesome movie, however it took up like 7 hours. After that I went to hang out with my cool friends in twyckingham appts. That was a good time as always, and I crashed there on their futon. Saturday it was back to twyck. though this time I had a little more than I could handle. After I stopped drinking I was fine for a while but the twister really made me kinda dizzy. Thankfully anne was there to help me to the bathroom and stayed with me the entire time, which was awesome of her. I was really not feeling good, but when she had her arm around me and held my hand I knew that I was going to be okay. I think I'll be keeping it under control from now on. She then helped my crawl to her room where she made me a spot to stay on her floor so she could watch out for me. Not my most stellar moment, but it showed me just how compassionate anne can be. We did end up drinking all of the alcohol their so I talked to my dad and I'm going to be bringing a 5th of Absolute and some other 5th to help restock my friends in twyck. I'm off to my mom's house for the work week, but I hope that I have the internet or else I'll go crazy :P Until we meet again livejournal"

"event","I spent a lot of time thinking this over at work today, and it seems like a really great idea. For people like me who love to cuddle, and don't have the relationship right now, it would be nice to always have someone there. I really miss the feeling of having someone in my arms, and this way I could have that again. I can't think of any downside that this could have, though that might be because I am just so cuddle deprived right now :( I just have to find me someone cuddly who doesn't mind being my ""buddy"".I think that would be quite a odd question to ask someone, so we will see if I can actually find someone or not. It's been a long day and my bed is calling to me, so I'll put some more thoughts down tomorrow.

"event","For me love is like a storm. It's chaotic and fierce, yet beautiful and amazing. When the storm rolls in, it always hits hard and fast. 
Love has always been something elusive for me. Always out of my grasp, sometimes it would seem only inches away. Sometimes I try so hard that love has no possibily of showing up, while other times I don't try hardly enough and it slips away. I'm my own worst enemy when it comes to love, and I'm also probably the reason that it has yet to show up in my life. If you know me, then chances are you also know that I'm a hopeless romantic. I would like nothing more than moonlit strolls, candle light dinners, chick flick movie nights. Yet through my own doing I have none of that, and there is no prospect of it happening anytime soon. I am just too shy to put myself out there and take a risk on love because it hasn't ever worked in the past for me. Being me can be quite a hard prospect sometimes. A hopeless romantic trapped in a very shy person's body I see love and want it, yet I haven't got a chance to get it. And when I say shy, I really mean very very shy when it comes to girls. I can't even make eye contact with girls that I walk past on the street, let alone ever venture over to one and say hi. For me it just isn't in the cards, so I'm trapped. Apparently even a little alcohol does nothing to curb this shyness, as I found out last night. It's quite sad, but I don't think I can possibly do anything to change this, yet I don't want to accept it either. What I need is a girl who would be willing to take that first step, just that little one that I can't do, and then it would all be good from there. I've tried to dig myself out of this predicament for a very long time, but what I really need is just for a girl to come and save me from myself, I need to be saved."

"event","It has been months since I last wrote in my journal. So long in fact that I decided to wipe away the past and start anew. With this new beginning I think I've decided to lay out my thoughts about that all important topic of love, or my take on it anyways. It's the most important topic to me right now, and I thought that it would be best if I layed it out on e-paper."

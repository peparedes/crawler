"event","hmm

no one reads this thing so i guess it's safe to write whatever i want. livejournal is so dead. i have another blog, which i was going to make a music blog, but then i got lazy. 

yesterday zane came over and i had him help me look for my birth certificate which i knew was in one of the shoeboxes in my closet. i needed it because i had to renew my lisence today and on the website it said i would need it. the first shoebox i opened did not contain my birth certificate. but i found a picture of me and jamie, notes from melissa and pat on diner placemats and cigarette foil wrappers, a slide of greg and me from when we put his portfolio together for mica, ticket from napoleon dynamite, ticket from some phillies game we took lara to....god, i wish some things could go back to the way they used to be. i miss lara so much, i don't even know if she has the same number. i texted her a couple times but she never got back to me. and pat and melissa are a million miles away and i swear i never realized how sane those two kept me. all those friendships morphed into different things, it's weird how that happens. how people fall apart and fall back into eachother again. but i think some friends i'll have forever. like pat and haley and melissa. 

the second box i went into also did not contain my birth certificate. it did, however, hold records of notes and letters from my old friends and boyfriends from high school. i read a couple. it's funny how intense these boys thought their love was for me. it's like dude, you're fifteen. this one boy was a mormon and i was with him for awhile freshman year. we never even saw eachother, he was never allowed out and stuff. i don't think that had anything to do with his religion, he was just never allowed out. anyway i remember i used to go watch him skate at drug emporium haha and behind wesco which is now future fitness or something? who knows. that was life before driving. that was shane. last i heard he moved to texas and smokes opium. he was straight edge when he was here. i hope he's doing ok, he was a good person. anyway these notes he wrote me were ridiculous, just his confessions of his supposed love for me and how he wished we could like run away together and shit. before that...and after that...and after that again was brandon. we were off and on like all throughout high school. it was like every time i would break up with someone i'd just go back to him. we were more friends than anything though, and we always stayed friends when we broke up. it's so weird to think about that now, how we always stayed friends even when we were with other people we would be friends. we would break up and then hang out with eachother the next week with our new boyfriend and girlfriend! and it didn't even bother us. i could never do that with anyone now. anyway his letters weren't that intense, just accounts of the day and stuff. he joined the navy and is married now and trying to have a kid last i heard from him. his brother lives in my development and has a new baby with a girl i graduated with. and then there were a bunch of letters from a bunch of other people. some of them are really funny. i never understood really why i shoved some of them into a box and never threw them away, but i guess i understood last night. then there were the andy songs and letters. and they were intense. and i even showed zane one from himself, haha.. 

when you're that age you're like an addict, confusing love with the intensity of an experience. in different stages of your life, love and friendship mean different things. now i think it's more about loyalty, but the passion's still gotta be there to keep it together. i'm very happy where i am and who i'm with. i don't miss the drama, but i do miss the mix tapes...and my far away friends.

i did find my birth certificate in the last box i looked in. and when i went to the dmv today, they didn't even need it."

"event","i forgot how much i thoroughly enjoy this album. i sold it years ago for gas money (along with alot of other good shit. i was retarded...or something. maybe just confused. i was really confused. and broke.) anyway, i found it used at tunes for like three bucks the other day so i picked it up. i almost put it back, too. i'm glad i didn't. i think blindspot may be my favorite..and words for you. they were awesome when i saw them at the rotunda with engine down. i remember i went with my friend evan. and i'm pretty sure i wore my orange astros shirt, and brown corduroys. the button was broke on those dumb pants, but i insisted on wearing them every day. and these hideous shoes that looked like bowling shoes but they weren't. i remember getting an engine down poster, i wonder what happened to that. i still have the pin. and they played alot of songs off fallen star collection which i was really happy about. i wonder how that kid is doing, i haven't talked to him in awhile. hahaha i just found him on myspace music. what a creepy thing the internet is. add.

yesterday my heart started racing for no reason while i was just sitting on the couch then i started freaking out and i felt dizzy and nauseous and tried to lay down and sleep it off but my heart kept racing. so i knocked on haley's door and made her check my pulse and she said it was fast and i asked her to stay in my room cause i didn't want to die alone and she laughed at me. she said i was probably just sick and fighting something off. then i started shaking bad and threw up and then laid on the bathroom floor for awhile. then i started feeling a little better so i moved back to my bed and i laid there and my heart would like do that shit every once in awhile and was preventing my from going to sleep but then i finally did. then chris came over and brought me gatorade and i was pretty much feeling better by the end of the night i was just hot and cold and stuff. oh, and in my delirium, i got up out of bed and put larry's keys in my purse. then christina said today that she called me twice yesterday and texted me, neither of which i remember. anyway that shit only happened to me once before, and it was a reaction to some energy drink. except that time i threw up more. so i don't know what would have caused that to happen to me, sometimes i get really shaky if i have too much caffeine and don't eat, but i did eat and i didn't even have much caffeine, i had some soda and iced tea. today at work i didn't even drink a cup of coffee...not even this morning. which was weird because i'm used to drinking like at least five cups while i'm at work. well, anyway i'm not dead so that's cool. i felt really fucked up like i was drugged or something.

tonight i'm in all alone. i don't want to go out, i think i'm going into hibernation mode. haley's not going to be home for our show tonight :(. i called jess to see if her and ian wanted to come over, so that might happen later. i hope so. 

ok, seinfeld's on."

i drove to delaware with my mom yesterday. i love spending my day off with her, we have fun together. she wanted to look at that graveyard. we got lunch at crown fried chicken. panda and i started a new band. i listened to an old mixtape in my mom's car and it made me depressed a little but the songs were good so i kept it on. i might have people over tonight. i think i need to get some sunshine. i think i'm getting sick because sun hasn't touched my skin enough. is that a real thing? can that really happen? i just want to crawl back into bed. my nose is runny and i'm cranky. my brain is broken and i can't concentrate on anything lately for more than like two seconds at a time i have no attention span. i need a vacation."

"event","i tried filling out some dumb survey that took a million years to finish. but i gave up halfway through because it started getting really stupid.. so..here i am.

my mom-mom c's up from florida! i got to see her last night, which was rad. she's the sweetest person you'll ever meet in your life, she's so cute and selfless. my pop-pop just passed in september, and she's been living alone down there since. i think she may be considering moving back up here since all her family is here. that would be good for her, i think. she doesn't really have much family down there. i'm glad that my two cousins and i took the road trip down there before my pop pop passed. we all had a good time together, talking and playing games. cooking, and watching movies and tv together, and entertaining for our fam while we were there..we made lasagna the one night.

i have to make lasagna for new years eve, speaking of cooking and stuff. i hope it doesn't turn out too bad. my grandma (on my dad's side, not my mom-mom who i was just speaking of) is asking that i make bruschetta (which i'm totally ok with making and bringing. it's simple and easy) but was also trying to get me to make an antipasto. i told her i don't have the money to do that, and she told me that was fine, but to figure out something else to bring. thursday, i'll review with her what i'm supposed to go over everything with her that i'm suppose to be making..we're going to gave a late lunch together, since that's my first day back from work.

i seriously need a hair cut. i'm getting cranky. i'm very close to taking these scissors to my head.

my birthday is the 23rd. weird. i'm going to be 24. ya know, this was supposed to be my year of jordan? well guess what? IT SUCKED! anyway, i have a good feeling about this next year."

i took a break from the bends and put on ok computer last night. i forgot how good it is. i do not, however, think that ok computer is flawless like the bends is. the bends is always in my rotation. 

i am STOKED for the curious case of benjamin button. i can not wait to see this. i will go by myself if no one wants to go with me. i have not been looking forward to going to the movies so much since i saw the trailer for superbad. i never go to the movies. the last time i went was probably to see wall-e. aww, wall-e was good. tiff was my date for that one and i ate too much popcorn. why is it that they call it 'popcorn'? shouldn't it be 'popped corn'? like how people SAY 'ice tea', but really it's 'iced tea'. anyway, i hate eating popped corn because it always gets stuck in my teeth, but i always get it anyway. it's so much better than candy. tiff likes to put m&ms in her popcorn. i remember this from when we went to see back to the future. that was awesome.

let's all fist.

in other news, thanksgiving was pretty alright. i went to my mom-mom t's (who is not actually my grandmother, but my mother's sister's mother-in-law...) with my mom. there's a whole shit load of drama in my immediate family right now, it's ghey. whatever.

yesterday i woke up at 8, worked til 12, then went back to sleep again until 4. then my mom came over for dinner, we watched movies all night. she came over when i was halfway done watching happy gilmore. then we watched the end half of little man (what a stupid movie! i loved it!) and then white girls was coming on. (i love the part in that movie where they're in the dressing room and the one wayan is trying pants on and the girl catches him trying to squeeze into them and he's like, ""i think i need a bigger size"" and the girl's like, ""no way, you NEVER need a bigger size"". also a dumb movie i love watching when it comes on tv.) i'm glad i got to hang out with my mom last night. i've been seeing alot more of my mom now that she's been staying with my aunt and she's right around the corner from me, almost. i go over my aunt's at least 3 times a week. they all bust my non-existent balls about my routine. i'll go over there, eat, use the computer, take a nap, get a phone call, then leave, supposedly. so whenever my phone rings or i get a text message my uncles like, ""oh, there's her cue. see ya crystal!"" i haven't been napping there lately, though. i haven't done that in a couple of weeks. oh, and last week my aunt and i went to the dirt mall to scope out cheap ridiculous stuff for our pollyanna christmas this year. 

dirt mall, dirt mall, here we come
dirt mall, dirt mall, let's see scum
lookin through the trashy stuff
until we think we've had enough

we wrote that song on the way there the last time we went. which was about a month ago, i think. anyway, i got some good ideas.

dear naked dude,
why would you walk out onto your balcony completely naked? anyway, thank you. panda and i are still laughing about this. she saw your dong, i didn't.

in other news, i've been getting in touch with old friends, and that rules. also, i love heritages. and turkey hill iced tea. and it's tea season now, as in hot tea. i broke out the peppermint tea last week, it was delicious. i have decided i really like my chipped tooth, and i don't know why i stopped pulling staples out of paperwork with my teeth (i think it had something to do with me chipping that tooth on a staple...) i think everyone should have fucked up teeth. just start chewing on bricks, it's sexy.

i love that i'm working right now. i'm sitting here on my couch with my laptop on this coffee table listening to music and eating a sandwich. 

yesterday was my day off. i went and got my mail, then hung out with haley at the apartment. we watched clueless and quoted the same things at the same time along with the movie, i love it. that movie is seriously so good. then i went to meet up with her to watch larry play at the library. then at the very end of the night i went to otts to meet up with everyone and see meehan before she goes back to florida.

"event","so i'm on my cell phone out back, and i had just lit a cigarette when i look up and see this bird flying around all crazy. then i realize it's a bat. and it's diving all over the place in broad daylight and freaking me out. so i move over to the side of the house where i don't have to look at it anymore, and after like 2 minutes the fucking thing finds me with it's sonar or something and dives right toward me. the thing was like 3 feet away from my face. so i went inside after that. i thought those things were nocturnal."

"event","So, Ron sits down on the couch beside me, then realizes i'm watching <i>Edward Scissorhands</i> for the 2nd time this week. He sighs, and complains that this is the second time in one week that he's watched that movie. So I hand him the remote, walk into the kitchen and when I come back I look at the screen to find him watching <i>Beetlejuice</i> on another channel. I laugh really hard, and kiss him on the forehead. He just smiles, knowingly. I love my boyfriend so much. He's the best ever. 

Prior to that, we went food shopping at the ACME. We got some pretty good deals. That microwavable Healthy Choice soup (my favorite thing to bring to work for lunch) was 3 for 5, which isn't bad. And those 100 cal english muffins that I like for breakfast were also on sale. Hooray. 

Baker came over tonight, and we did soco and lime shots. That was fun. We talked about Barbies in vaginas, and I want to buy the new lipstick she has. We also looked at old livejournal entries of mine and reminisced. I told her I wished she hadn't deleted hers. 

Then Greg came over and we watched the Nick Swardson dvd. He just recently left.


WHO FUCKING FARTED?!!

i have work tomorrow, but it's not a big deal that I'm up late since I'm working from home on saturdays now. I'm considering making this an all nighter and reading the rest of the book i'm in the middle of.

Does anyone want to move to Canada with me?"

"event","I will never understand why people delete their livejournals. Seriously. Even though I was immature and did and said some seriously dumb shit, it's fun to be able to look back on it and see how we've all grown.

Today at work I got a horrible nose bleed out of the blue. Same thing happened two weeks ago. I think it's from the dry heat. I am probably going to have to go to the ENT to get that shit cauterized again. This sucks because I have no health insurance. I wish I had money to buy my way into Canada.

After work, I went to my grandma's to see my aunt and little cousins. They gave my my birthday presents. I got a pug webkinz and the my little pony movie. I'm twelve. Then I played some games with my cousins, talked to my grandma a little bit and left. 

I'm super stoked for tomorrow night!!!11"

ron and i are going on ""holiday"" the end of october. i'm stoked.&nbsp;

i'm also stoked that it's jacket weather. and the air smells different. fall rules.&nbsp;

last night ron and i went to the city and bought lots of new cds. i love shopping for music with him. i always start at a, and he starts at z and we work our way toward each other. knowing how to not get in your way is an awesome quality for a dude to possess. kidding.&nbsp;

i started to take down the wallpaper in our upstairs bathroom. i forgot what a pain in the ass this process is. ugh, it's going to take forever. it'll be worth it when i'm done though, that wallpaper was so fucking disgusting. i haven't decided on what color i'm going to paint it yet, i'm leaning toward a pale blue or yellow. we'll see.&nbsp;

But he was always trying really hard..and making an effort not to be a jerkoff. So it was fine. Until Christmas. I decided on Christmas that I can't see him anymore. Not until he quits drinking. Because he was a complete fuckface to me on christmas. I think it might have had to do with the fact that Ron wasn't there (He was sick. The only reason I left the house in the first place was because my uncle Joe from Brooklyn came down. And he never comes down.) and that makes me think that me thinking he was making an effort and being nice, was a facade for when Ron was around. So ron didn't like punch him in the face or something...so there goes that. He fronts. <br /><br />I got a new VW rabbit. It's awesome. <br /><br />Ron took me to Longwood Gardens on my birthday. And he threw me a surprise party the night before my birthday! I have the best boyfriend ever. <br /><br />The basement is almost all finished. It's going to be fucking rad.</font> <br /><br /><img height=""553"" width=""750"" alt="""" src=""http://i145.photobucket.com/albums/r220/crystalnj/longwoodgardens045.jpg"" /> <br />"

It's been so long since I've done anything with this. The new live journal look is bizarre.

I need a vacation. I was so stressed out today at work today that I almost started crying. but I've got the 'curse', so that may also have something to do with that.

Ron and I bought season one of 'The Office', and I think I've watched it every night since we bought it on Sunday. Today is Wendnesday. Soon to be Thursday...

I have off on Friday. Ron and I are going to spend the day together, which will be cool since we haven't really seen eachother all week. Then, that night, Lara and Haley and I are going to the Phillies game. That should be rad. 

Also, on Friday Renee is going to do my hair. Then ron and I have to pick up our rented car from Enterprise and drive up to Staten Island for my cousin Richie's wedding.

This will be the first time since I left my house that I will have to look at my father. It's going to be weird. And I really don't know what to think about that. I'm so afraid of what might come out of my mouth. I think I just need to keep my distance. I really don't know what I'm going to do...or say. I guess I'll just have to figure it all out when the time comes....in two days.

The house is coming along good. Our bedroom is pretty much finished. I've been trying to paint the ceiling in the spare room but I can't figure out how to take the blinds down because I'm an idiot, so i'll have to wait until a night that ron will be home. The drywall in the living room is just about done. As soon as it is we'll be ready to paint. We replaced the warped wooden front door with a new fiberglass one that looks really nice. I think that we've decided on bamboo flooring in the dining room/living room and hallway. I think we're just going to keep the hardwood for the bedrooms. I can't wait to paint living room/dining room/hallway - I'm really excited about the color choice, and I'm stoked to see how it brings everything together. 

........and that's about it."

Life's been pretty awesome. Spending alot of time with friends. Pat, Melissa and Alex, Ryand and Cara. Haley came over the other day, too. I'm helping her move on the 31st of the month. I'm glad she's not going far, I don't know what I'd do without her. 

I'm doing good at work, disputing illegal charges and stuff is fun and I'm really good at it. Yesterday I won back like $1600. Yeahhh.

Boy Meets World is on, and Topanga was wearing a Phillies hat. I hate Topanga. She's such a dirty hippie. 

My bookcase is expanding. Last night Ron and I went to Barnes and Noble so he could buy this skateboard book that has lots of photos of old school decks and stuff. That's what his half-sleeve is going to consist of. I'm excited to see how it turns out. The guy doing his work is real into that stuff, too, so we're sure he'll be into working on it. I bought <i>Chinese Takeout</i> by Arthur Neresian (the only book by him I haven't read, yet) and <i>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</i>, by Haruki Murakami. It's sooo nice outside! I have off today, so I'll probably spend my time reading outside on the balcony while smoking cigarettes and drinking black coffee and water with lemon. Yeahh..and the dog can come too, I guess. He's eating a hat right now. He's being an asshole today. I can't wait until he gets big and fat and can't breath right and just wants to sit around all day. Aww, but he's so cute right now..I can't stay mad at him for long. 

Melissa and I were supposed to go to Urban Outfitters and Cosi today, but I have yet to receive her phone call. That's too bad, I was really looking forward to the change of scenery. And it's soooo nice outside! (Have I said that already?)

i had off work today. i have off on fridays now. along with sundays. but sundays are normal days off with things to do. today was weird. probably due to the fact that i was alone..well, aside from the dog. but he's an asshole.

haley and i talked on the phone for a really long time today. we came to the realization that we both have off on fridays, and that this should be our play-date-day. starting next week, though. i'm glad we got to talk today. i missed her lots.

ron and i are going to maine the first week of october. i'm excited. i want to rent a hummer.

i had a turbo ice from dunkin donuts for lunch. i'm jittery. 

yesterday when i came home from work, i was standing in the kitchen and i heard a weird noise. i thought maybe a bug got into the house because it sounding like something was batting against the ceiling. tap tap tap. but i looked up and around, but saw no bugs. so i looked down, and there was a big fucking puddle on the floor. what i thought was a tapping turned out to be a dripping. but since it was going onto the carpet, i guess the sound was more absorbed. the guy who lives above us' air conditioner broke or something. i was scared that it wasn't going to stop...but it did. and that guy has to pay for the water damages.

We went to her dad's office and made sweet sweet love. She tried to get me an application for there, but their secretaries desk was a hell of a mess...so I have to wait til later this evening.

Then Ron and I had a sleepover. A drunken one.

Sunday we woke up and went on a Home Depot adventure. I don't know why I like it there so much, but I do. I could spend hours looking at the model kitchens and bathrooms. I should have my next birthday party there.

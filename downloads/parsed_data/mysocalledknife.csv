<s>Just when you thnk you've found that someone you'll never lose, you lose them. It  like smacks you in the face harder then you thought you could be smacked in the face. 

I'm sick of being sad. I get sad/depressed over things, and it gives me this physical feeling in the pit of my chest, like right then would be the perfect time to be shot in the face. Things depress me and I can't get over it for a while, yet everyone else is all fucking happy and perfect right away. I'm sick of feeling this way. I'm done. If anyone wants to be my friend then be my fucking friend, don't act like you ""like"" me when  all you like is how I have no other fucking friends, so no worries if  her feelings get hurt it's not like anyone will  fucking care. Don't even try and be my friend. You know you don't want to. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE. 
I also find myself saying stupid things when I'm around certain people, and they point out what I said and they do it in a way that sounds so fucking horrible and it makes me feel like the stupidest person the world. I get a really bad feeling like I should just go and hang myself right then and there, it nice....I'm sensitive....I should die already. I like it.

I went to Landslide last night with Brandon. There were a few good times, but not so much for the most part. Whenever I go to places like that I feel like I stick out so fucking much because I'm so disgusting I can't even take it, I can hardly imagine what strangers think.....then you have these perfect girls jumping all around being sooo cute, and you just want to  lay  in a corner and die.  

Isn't it nice when you go out with a group of people and say or do something, and then one of them calls you dumb/stupid/or just gives you hat look like you should die, then not even two minutes later a different person does something just as stupid and everyone laughs.....oh yeah I like when that happens to me expecally when it happens multiple times in only a  few hours.</s> 

<b>I love Brandon, yeah, no matter what pretty much...last night kinda proved that. Not that it matters now. I killed it.</b>"

News Flash...Tabbu was never sexually attractive. It's not news to me. But for anyone who doesn't know me I'm a dog. Life's prety sad when you're strongly attracted to other people but no one is to you. *sniff sniff* boohoo!

->WoW I'm a fucking tart.
I lied to you beautiful. Im VERY, very, very, very, very, very sorry. I told you I wasn't sad. Which was only part true. You thought I was sad/upset for a different reason then I was.  I wasn't sad that you had fun. I wasn't sad that you made a friend (believe it or not I WANT you to have friends other than me). I wasn't sad that I wasn't there. I was sad because I'm a fool. A leech. It hurts me to think i'll lose you. Because I know I will. I NEVER want to lose you. I'm way to attached to you. I can't lose you...but I will.<-

I had to watch a video of my last band concert the other day in school.  I now see me how other people  see me. Have seen me for years...and some. Pure disgusted. Please bitch at me tell me how purdy I am. Tell me how much I should just ""love"" myself. Tell me how you know what it feels like to look like me. You can't so please don't try. Don't even attempt.  Soooooo instead of bitching anymore I'm going to end it. End the bitching and the way I look. HOPEFULLY in time it will show. Maybe not....if not maybe I'll accidentlly get hit by a car some day?? Haha please take me serously...you know you want to. :)

I'm thinking about making a new journal. I hate this one. I hate who I was when I started it. I hate who I made myself seem to be. I suck at writting. I  just want to start over. But then there's the memories in this one. First times, last times, scary times. If only I could just print it all out and keep it for my own little pity. I don't have a printer. Hmph. Or I could just suck it all up and destroy it. It would take a few clicks and poof gone. *POOF*. :)



The more I sing by myself, the more I wish I could sing for other people....the more I wish I could sing well.

"event","Went to LandSlide last night. Mikes band did good. I wasn't really into the last two bands.
Seen Steve Cuff get chased by a ""hardcore"" punker. ha. 
Also Brandon got pushed by this stuck up bitch. The kind you just want to make her ""pretty"" face ugly. Just because he was trying to have a good time. Sheesh.

I had a dream a few nights ago. For the first time in a while. It was really weird..
I was laying on a bed....on my back. Then this girl comes in the room. She was one of those girl that had like NO body fat what-so-ever but she was perfect looking. Not sickly looking. She had a freshly shaved head. On her it looked perfect...one of those few girls that actually look good with a shaved head. She was wearing a white tank top (the kind with the thick parts that go over the shoulders, but not  yet a wife beater.) and over that she was wearing a baby blue one that had random words written all over it. You could see the straps of the white one peek out. Both shirts were skin tight. So tight you could tell she was not wearing a bra. Anyways as i was laying on my back she crawls on top of me and just sits there staring at me with kinda puppy dog eyes. And that's when I woke up!  
I had another dream last night...
This time I was at some social event? There were a lot of people around my age there. We were all pretty much just hanging out. This little blond girl was staring at me for  some time, then comes up to me and we talk a little. She then motions over to some guy across the romm and tells me how he wants her but he doesn't see that she's with someone. The thing is she wasn't with someone...she wanted ME to pretend to be with her so he'll leave her alone. Just being nice I agreed. Then she reaches up and kisses me. I wasn't at all expecting that. I was just expecting to have to stand with her for a while. She then grabs my hand and leads me into a public bathroom into and empty stall. There we proceed to make out. It's now that I realize the whole time she really wanted me and used that story about the guy to get me. Humph. I'm amazed at this point making out with this cute innocent little blond chick. That's when the dream ended.

I got about 12 hours of sleep and i'm still tired. What the heck. 
Well I have to go shower and go over Shannons."

It's just not enough.  We both have lost our jobs.  It's tighter than it's ever been.  I feel that despair.  When the economy started getting bad, I'd hear these stories on the news about families dying at their own hands.  I kept thinking, my god, how do people get to that point where they think that's the only way?  I understand now.  It's such a feeling of desperation.  I would never in a million years take that route, but I now understand what those people must have felt.  There's a pit in my stomach.  Rick can't even eat, he's so sick with worry.  I have no idea how we'll come up with the money to get it back on.  But still I keep on the happy face so my kids still smile.  I'm failing them miserably.  They don't deserve this.  I don't deserve this.  How did we get here?"

"event","I'm doing better.  I've settled into being 30, embracing it.  I guess.  LOL.  I'm happy to report that we've officially been TTC #3.  If I felt out of my mind in my last post, imagine what having a 3rd child will do to me.  We shall see what happens.  If I got pg this month, it will in fact be a miracle.  I'll keep ya'll posted.

On to other things.  I need opinions on whether I've over reacted or not.  Honest opinions.  My best friend called me 3 mos ago all excited that she bought Bon Jovi tix.  That was my birthday present.  I was totally excited, the concert is tomorrow night.  She sent out a bulletin on myspace yesterday morning that said she had 2 tix to sell.  Um hello?  So I sent her a message back saying thanks for letting me know, I took off work and everything.  She told me not to ""get my panties in a bunch"" because they probably won't sell and she's so broke she needs the money, blah blah blah.  That's fine, I'm sorry to hear that, but don't you think she should have at least TOLD me on the phone or something that she was selling my F'ING birthday present?  How rude was that?  Not to mention, it was 2 days before the concert.  And she DID indeed sell them, and has still not told me.  Stupid bitch.  Best friend my ass.  I'm 30 years old now, not 15.  I'd expect that in high school.

I'm outtie...tired and stuff.  I'm leaving you with some quizzes...lol.  It gets boring here a lot.

PS--Krista, if you're reading, I miss you and I've emailed you and tried to get a hold of you any way I knew how. You've got me worried, girl.  Email me back or something, I MISS YA!

"event","I feel like things are getting out of control.  My mind is going a mile a minute.  Everything from what's my ex boyfriend up to these days to I have to put laundry away.  I feel like out of control.  I don't know why.  I feel like a bad mom, in fact I know I'm a bad mom.  Today they watched TV all day while I read a book.  All. Day.  I made them lunch, but it took them nagging me for a half hour to do it.  I love them dearly, but I just didn't want to be here today.  Rick's been taking my car to work becaue his license plate sticker is expired, so until we can cough up the $100 to replace it, I'm out a car.  So we had to walk to the store today just to get milk.  And that was a chore.  I just didn't want to be anything really.  I took them out to eat while we were out walking, and once we got there, I gave them quarters to go play games just so I wouldn't have to deal with them.  Why is this?  Why am I so aggravated lately?  Maybe it's stress.  We have no money, we never do.  It's not like it's because we're caught up on bills.  I don't think there's ever been a time where we have been.

Maybe it's because I'm 30?  Sounds crazy.  I so badly want to be that mom that gets up at 6, does laundry and dishes and all of the housework and bill paying while the kids are still asleep.  Then they get up and we dine on pancakes and eggs for breakfast, and off to the park.  Then we have lunch, clean up and go outside to play.  Come in for dinner, then bath, and read some books quietly on the couch until it's time to peacefully go to sleep.  In reality, I get up when the kids jump on me in the morning.  The house is trashed, they didn't even get breakfast today because we had no damn milk.  I made lunch at 1:00 and they watched TV all day because it rained.  That's until Jack was annoying Kyle and Kyle deliberately tripped him as he ran away, making Jack fall and hit the wall.  Crying hysteria ensued and I made Kyle sit in his room for 2 hours.  2 hours!  What the hell is wrong with me?  2 hours is ridiculous, but I didn't care.  That boys presses every button imaginable, then somehow finds more.  He's mean.  He's a smart ass.  He's ignorant to me, to Rick, and especially Jack.  Why?  Why must he keep it up?  God help me in 5 years when he's a teenager.

I want to get out of the house for something other than work.  I honest to God cannot tell you the last time Rick and I went out.  That's how long it's been.  I hear moms say this all the time, but they laugh.  I'm not laughing, I really don't know when the last time was.  I want to date again.  I want to go out somewhere, anywhere.  But, of course we can't do that, one of us is always working.  Always gone.  He didn't even come home between jobs tonight.  And is it worth it?  No.  We never have money.  All this bullshit, and we're still broke.  Never together as a family, and for what.  When we are home, on Sunday mornings, Rick sleeps because he's so tired from working 70 hours a week he can't get up.

I don't know where I'm going with this, but it felt good to get that little bit off my chest.  Believe me, there's more.  But I need to go lay down."

I wanted to finish my college degree, didn't do that.  Of course I have my 2 cute as hell kids, but I wanted one more.  I wanted one more before 30.  I told myself when Kyle was born that I didn't want kids past 30.  Now I'm 30.  No more kids.

Then again, maybe the 30's will bring bigger and better things.  I mean, when i think 30's, I think more financially stable, settled down, all that good stuff.  Who knows what the 30's are going to bring.  I do know that it can't be worse than the 20's. 

Rick and my brother and SIL had a surprise party for me.  Too bad half the invitees didn't show up.  Even Rick left early to go to his hockey game...lol.  He took the kids with him in case I went out afterwards, but as it turned out, I was home by 9:30 and him and the kids got home at midnight...lol.  Oh well, I'll go out one of these days.

Talking to me like I'm some sort of slave, constantly going on and on about how he works and I don't.  Which is hysterical, because I leave the house for over 30 hours a week, and bring home a paycheck, so if that ain't work, I don't know what is.  Ughhh!  Saturday, I worked all f'ing day, and then had to do the easter shopping after that.  I was gone from 8 am to 8 pm.  He had the nerve to ask where the hell I'd been.  Um, duh asswipe, we ARE the easter bunny, the shit doesn't just appear.  So then he asked why I didn't go during the week.  Well, let's see.  I'm with the kids EVERy WAKING MINUtE that I'm home...and if i'm not home, I'm at work....after work, stores are closed.  But you're right, I should have had this done weeks ago.  IDIOT.  To top it off, he called me a dumbass for forgetting to pick up pop....and I don't need to go on about that one.  

That night, he had a hockey game.  One word- Karma.  He hurt his back playing saturday night and could hardly move by the time he got home.  Paybacks are a bitch.  That'll teach him to treat me like shit.  My dad's watching over me, I just know it.

"event","So I've been telling Rick for approximately 6 months that I think something's wrong with the plumbing.  Does he listen?  No, come on, does any man?  About 2-3 months ago, whenever I ran water for a long time, like doing dishes or laundry....everyday by the way.....it would smell like rotten eggs in the house.  I even went online and googled this problem, and it mentioned something about the hot water heater.  Made sense to me, I use a lot of hot water, and that was when it seemed the worst.  Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago, all of a sudden when you flushed the toilet, you could hear pressure and gurgling in the kitchen sink.  Now I know we're all cringing, but I assure you, no sewage of any sort was bubbling up anywhere.  I tell Rick again, and nothing.  Finally, I call the neighbor who does sewer things for a living...why would you want to do that....anyhoo, he came today and after about an hour of rodding, it's finally fixed.  I can't believe what a difference this made.  Good lord!  My house does not smell.  I feel like running water all night long.  I've been having a laundry party since about 8 tonight...LOL.

It's the little things, like cleaning shit and globs of dirt out of a sewer that excite me these days. Seeing as the access to the sewer is embedded in my flower bed, my flowers that have yet to be planted have some amazing fertilizer already.  That's a plus right?

So that's done.  All we need to do it replace the faucet in the kitchen and we're good to re-list the house on May 1st.  This time, it's selling, and we'll be in AZ in no time."

He's on multiple medications, and they've completely taken over my sweet, innocent, little lovey.  Prednisone is the culprit, I'm sure.  He's beating the crap out of everyone, stabbed me with a fork at breakfast yesterday and was having problems sleeping.  I think it's finally caught up to him though, because tonight around 7, he actually asked for his jammies and wanted to go to bed.  Poor guy.  I'm just glad he's ok.

"event","Man, this royally sucks. You may or may not remember, almost exactly a year ago, Jack was hospitalized for what they kept calling an ""asthma-like episode"". Well, here we are again. Yesterday, he started coughing, and I didn't think anything of it because Kyle had somewhat of a cold a week before. But then he kept coughing and coughing, so I broke out the nebulizer, which hasn't been used since last year's episode. I gave him a treatment, and he seemed better. Today, same thing. He got up, was coughing, and I gave him a treatment, and we went about our business. He's acting totally fine...playing, laughing, having a hootin hollerin good time with his brother off for Spring Break. 

The only thing ""off"" about him today was that he didn't eat lunch. He didn't have a fever or anything, yet was still coughing, so I finally called the Dr. She wanted to see him immediately, so I called off work and hauled butt there. She listened to him, and said, holy cow, he's really not moving much air. So they gave him a treatment and came back to check him and he was MUCH better. Trying to make a long story short, she wanted to hospitalize him until I told her that he's got no insurance right now....which is a whole other issue that I haven't even posted about because you're not allowed to use the words I'd need to use to get through that post....So, needless to say, he's on FIVE medications right now, and if he's not better by tomorrow afternoon, he needs to go to the ER whether he's insured or not.

Bottom line....please keep Jackie in your thoughts. I just want him better. I'll deal with the bills later if need be.

Today is day f'ing 30.  2 days late. Now before we get our panties in a bunch, the only day I COULD have possibly conceived would've been Rick's birthday, March 7th.  Which, according to every damn calendar out there, would have been the VERY last day possible that I'd be fertile.  (I really hate that word by the way).  I have taken a First Response test, and today it said negative.  It's obviously too early.  I think I know I am.  I just have a feeling.  You know we all know our bodies better than anyone, and I just plain old don't feel right.  Not to mention, the past 2 days, I've been eating like the concept of food is coming to an end.  That's not like me at all.  I'm not exhausted just yet.  I just don't know what to think!  Something's got to be going on, I am NEVER late!  Aaack.  The waiting is what's killing me, the not knowing.  God help me.

By the way, if I am indeed pregnant, I just want to throw out there that it happened on the FIRST time without protecion in 4 years, on the very last possible day that I could have ovulated.  Could I BE anymore fertile?  geez"

Kids are doing good, Kyle's hockey team lost yesterday 9-6.  But that's ok because MY BABY scored ALL 6 of those goals.  It's so funny because I ask everyone I know to come watch his games, it would mean so much to him, and to me, but that's besides the point.  Not one of these assholes I've asked has shown up.

Kyle's hockey team FINALLY won their first game today, and let me tell you what my friends, you will be seeing Kyle one day playing professionally  somewhere...LOL.  They won 8-6, and guess who had 5 of those goals....yup, that's my boy!  I am such an obnoxious mother, I know and I don't care, my kid's awesome.

Something really odd has happened between Rick and I.  We're getting along better than we ever have, I feel closer to him now than ever.  I don't know what it is.  This May will be 10 years that we've been together, and this is probably the happiest we've been.  We have been in talks about a 3rd little bambino.  I can't wait.  We've never planned a kid before, so this is new territory for us.  I don't know exactly when we'll start TTC, but rest assured, it will be quickly.  He's always been a little anal about not being able to afford it, but shit, we're broke all the damn time anyway, and it's not because we don't make enough, we just spend too much, so I think that's what we're going to work out first.  Hopefully the world will be hearing me yelling soon, because I am too excited about this new adventure.

Nothing much else going on.  The camera broke, I ordered a new one...just waiting for that to show up.  I've been working my tail off, so has Rick, and the only night I'm home now is Thursday.

Anyhoo, things seem to be going swimmingly.  Kyle had a hockey game today, and I actually got to go.  I'm so happy too, because he got his first career Hat Trick today.  I couldn't believe it.  He really is good!  Rick kept telling me how good he is, and I just brushed it off like yeah yeah yeah, you have to say that, he's your spawn...but really, he's good.  I was impressed.  He's still a little shit, which I'll get to, but he's a good hockey playing shit...lol.

So, last night, I get the kids in bed and for some reason, I stood on the stairs for a minute to listen to them banter back and forth.  It went a little something like this (and sadly, this is word for word)

Me: Ok, night guys, sleep good, love you
Kyle: Night mom
Jack: Ni ni mamma

Then, there's me going to the stairway and pretending I went downstairs.

Kyle:  Mom, you still there?
Jack:  Just giggling and talking to himself
Kyle:  Hey Jackie....
Jack:  What Cowl
Kyle:  Say Fuck You 

Mom:  WHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTtt!!????  

At this point, I go back up the 3 stairs and run in Kyle's room and shut his TV off.  Scared the shit out of him, and he started crying immediately.  I honestly could not believe my ears.  I went off.  I mean, it's bad enough that he said it to begin with, but to tell his 2 year old brother to say it?  Like he was trying to teach him...OMG, I was so pissed I could've beat him.  I didn't, but man....I was fuming!

Kyle's been off school for almost 2 weeks, he returns to school on Jan. 9th.  Not soon enough, I'm afraid.  Love the boy dearly, but you know what they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder.  I swear that boy is going to be the death of me.  You tell him the sky is blue and he'll either argue that it's green, or scream at you for telling him something he already knows.  Ask him to be quiet, he'll get louder.  It's getting worse as the years go on.  I'm losing more patience as the years go on, and there are times I just want to go away.  Far away.  

And don't even ask how Rick and I are doing.  It's just plain bad.  

This is a monumental year for me.  In 6 months and 14 days, I turn 30.  Sure, I have 2 kids, a house, a minivan (that hit it's own milestone on new year's eve, 100,000 miles), but I've been racking my brain trying to figure out what it is that's so great in my life, and I can't seem to find anything.  Rick thinks I'm going through a midlife crisis, I think it's just that he's made me so miserable for so long now that I don't know what a happy moment is anymore.  How sad is this?  How did I get here?  I'm so upset with me right now I don't know where to begin.  It's so cliche, but I really wish I had a rewind button......  

When Rick and I went out on our first date, I remember being on the phone with my best friend and I said to her ""please, god, don't let him show up in a beat up van or something"".  I was joking.  When he showed up in a beat up van, I should've turned and run the other way. When my brother's wife (then girlfriend) told me all about what an asshole and drug addict he was when she went to high school with him, I should've listened.  He's an asshole still, and a pothead to boot, and it's 17 years later.  When I finally got the nerve to kick his sorry ass out over 5 years ago, I should've kept it kicked out.  I had never been happier with my life than I was for the 9 months we were apart at that time.  

Of course I don't regret ever having my kids.  And I know had I made those different choices, they wouldn't be here, or maybe they would, who knows.  

Hopefully in the coming days, I can get my thoughts straightened out a little more."

Man sues ex-girlfriend over glue attack 
November 4, 2005 (GREENSBURG, Pa.) - A man claims his ex-girlfriend owes him more than $30,000 for gluing his genitals to his abdomen five years ago. ""This was not just some petty domestic squabble,"" attorney Grey Pratt told a Westmoreland County jury Wednesday. 

His client, Kenneth Slaby of Pittsburgh, is suing Gail O'Toole of Murrysville. His lawsuit claims the two broke up in 1999 after dating for 10 months and Slaby began dating someone else. 

Slaby contends that O'Toole invited him over to her home on May 7, 2000, where he fell asleep. He woke up to find that O'Toole had used Super Glue to stick his genitals to his abdomen, glued his buttocks together and spelled out a profanity on his back in nail polish. 

Slaby said O'Toole told him it was payback for their breakup, and he had to walk a mile to a gas station to call for help. He pressed charges and O'Toole pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and served six months' probation. 

O'Toole's attorney, Chuck Evans, said it was a consensual act and Slaby wasn't permanently damaged. 

""This is a case that should have been left in the bedroom,"" he said."

"event","So the house is for sale.  I'm pretty excited about it, although it does come with aggravation.  Take tonight for example.  We were to have some people come through here, and they didn't show up.  What really sucks about this is that it's MY key in the lock box, and Rick was at work.  I had left a note on the box saying do NOT lock the door, but since they didn't bother to show up, the door was never unlocked.  I had to call the realtor to get into my own home.  How much does that suck?

Oh well.  Moving on.  The kids are doing great, they made a killing trick or treating.  I have enough Snickers to last through next Halloween.  Yes, I go through their candy and take all my favorites.  Call me a horrible parent, but everyone does it.  Don't lie.

I'm having some issues lately with how my family is run.  It's that time of year where you hear a lot of stories about traditions and what not.  We don't have any.  Rick sucks, I'm convinced.  I keep hearing all these wonderful stories about fathers reading stories on Christmas Eve, everyone gathered around the tree, enjoying each other's company.  Not here.  Rick sits his ass on the couch every night and watches TV.  Christmas doesn't change that.  He never reads to the kids.  The Christmas tree is put up by me.  All 7.5 feet of fakeness, done by me.  I do all the ornaments, everything.  And then I swear about it for about an hour, because I hate our fake tree.  I do not enjoy fluffing the fake branches and it never looks good.  Somehow Rick finds a way to not be around while the tree's going up.  I don't know what to do about this.  He doesn't do any shopping either, never has, never will.  Shopping's not his thing.  He's awesome at wrapping though, seriously.  I told him he needs to do gift wrapping part time during the holidays because that man makes it look GOOD.  You don't hear me say that much about him, so you know it's THAT good....lol

If anyone actually reads this, can you give me some pointers about how I can get Rick to be more involved?  Not just for this time of year, but all the time.  Kicking his ass is not a suitable suggestion, either...lol"

"event","It never fails.  I'm perfectly content with my life as it is, and then MOM comes to visit, and inside my mind, all hell breaks loose.  I don't know what it is.  I feel like a loser, a failure, total white trash, it just goes on and on.  

My brother is pretty well to do, good for him.  We were always close growing up, but now, he's 10 minutes from me and cares about nothing other than himself.  I was over there for dinner last night, and he spoke maybe 5 words to me.  Maybe it means nothing, or maybe it just confirms all my thoughts about my life, I don't know. 

At any rate, it just sucks.  I hate this feeling.  They all got up and went out to breakfast together.  Why didn't they ask us to go?  We went out to a pumpkin patch today.  It was fun for the kids, of course.  But once again, all eyes had to be on Kris and HIS family.  Oh, look at Maddy, oh what's Maddy doing, oh isn't she just SOOOO cute??  Yeah, she's cute, but not as cute as Jack was when he did (enter cute thing here) 5 minutes before Maddy did, but of course it went unnoticed. 

It's just so frustrating.  Mom came over today for a while, and we just hung out.  Kyle of course had to be on his WORST behavior, which set my mom off onto her ""kyle needs a therapist"" rant.  The kid is disrespectful and has an attitude problem, it's nothing a therapist is going to fix.  A good beating would do the trick, but that's illegal.  So then, Kris comes to pick her up, before dinner so she can eat with them....why she can't eat dinner over here is beyond me, but whatever.  He walks in our newly redone kitchen and says, oh, nice.  Nice, that's it?  I worked my ass off on that damn room.  Sorry it's not as beautiful as your brand new fucking townhouse, but Jesus Christ it's a house, and we own it just as much as you own yours.  You're no better in that department, sorry!...ughhhhh!

So needless to say, I haven't done much since last week.  I cleaned my house last night, although since I had to work today, it's  trashed.  You know the saying, while the cat's away, the mice will play....well the mice have no authority when I'm not here apparently.  It's like a free for all.  How annoying that is.

Tomorrow is the day that I set for myself to quit smoking.  I'm not freaking out just yet.  I'm really going to try this time.  I want to quit.  I hate the smell, I hate smelling like it, I hate how dirty it is.  Rick has decided to not quit, so I know this is going to be rough.  Jerk.

Wish me luck.  Like I said, nothing much to talk about tonight, so I'm off."

I, however, checked out the Notebook.  I love Nicholas Sparks, and quit laughing people, there is a sappy side to me.  The funny part is that the regular copy was checked out, so I had to take the large print version...LMAO.  I figure, what the hell, it's the same book, but the words are HUGE....lol.  

We got home just in time for the freaky storm to hit.  It was quick, but furious.  Lots of trees down in the neighborhood, lights flickering, direct tv went out, the whole shot.  Very strange.  Then the sun came out, and all was normal again.  The kids and I took a walk to see all the cranes around the corner lifting a tree off someone's house.  This gigantic tree split 3 different ways, it was quite a site to see.

I'm thoroughly enjoying not babysitting anymore.  It's so nice to have my kids back, and from what I can tell, they feel the same way about me.  Tomorrow we have no plans, but we now have more opportunity to be spontaneous, so who knows what will happen.  I hate Thursdays for some reason, I guess because that means I have to work.  Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  It sucks, but I can't really complain anymore since it's my only job...lol.  I'm having a hard time finding something to complain about now.

The kids are doing great.  Kyle's got an attitude the size of Texas, and there's nothing that will get rid of it.  I would love to ship his ass to that new show Brat Camp, but it may just be a little too harsh for a 7 yr old.  Besides, he's cuter than hell, he just knows it, that's the problem. 

As for Jack, he's talking up a storm.  To hear him say thank you mom is about the best thing ever.  He's so perfect, I don't know what I ever did without him.

We've been hanging out in the new pool just about every day.  That thing has become my saving grace.  What's that Kyle, you're bored?  Go swimming.  ""Ok mom"".  LOL.  It's great, they should come standard with every house. 

Now that I don't babysit anymore, I have much more free time.  Hopefully I'll be updating every night, or at least every other night.  I have lots to talk about.  lol.

So what's been going on.  Hmmm.  Not too much, it's summertime, that just means a lot of playing outside.  Kyle's constantly on the go, and Jack's officially mastered the art of escaping.  No door is too difficult for him.  Not even the fridge.  Which is his new favorite place to raid.  He did get the eggs about a week ago while I was at work, and he completely egged my bedroom.  It was so sucky, I couldn't help but just laugh.  Because really, he's so damn cute and such a ham, that I physically cannot be mad at him.  He's such a joy to have around.  He's just trying to test his waters, that's all.  Now he needs to test them without eggs at his disposal, so I am running out shopping tomorrow to invest in a fridge lock.  And patio door alarms...lol...because he's run off on us one too many times.  

On to other fun stuff

Rick had knee surgery...ummm....it'll be 4 weeks ago this Friday.  It was a day from hell.  I dropped him off and waited for him to go back to the room, then took the babies, and we were going to go shopping.  Well, in true Lisa fashion, things fell apart.  The van wouldn't start.  The van wouldn't take a jump.  The van needed to be towed.  The van needed a new starter.  That f'ing van cost me $350 that day.  And a whole lot of headaches.  Oh well, it's done and over now, but man that sucked.  Rick's surgery was supposed to be quick, easy, fix a torn something or other, he's back on his feet and at work in 3 days.  WRONG.  He's still limping, almost 4 weeks later.  He's barely making it at work (construction type stuff) and he hasn't been able to ref since the surgery.  Turns out, they actually drilled holes in his bones.  Thanks for telling in advance assholes.  Then told him they wanted him off work for 6-8 weeks.  Sure, but will the dr pay our bills in the meantime?  NO.  So he went back to work anyway.

My birthday was this past saturday.  It went pretty unnoticed in this house.  I'm 29 now.  I think I will be forever.  Ha...no, I've vowed to make this a great year, if it kills me.  Or rick.  Maybe this is the year to kill rick...LOL.  Just kidding.

Anyhooo, then it was off to the park district to get kyle signed up for day camp for a few days a week.  And wouldn't you know, the little subdivision across the street from there was having their annual garage sale!  Woooohoooo!  Oh how I love those.  

This is the best part....the very first place we stopped....had a bike for Kyle.  The tag said $8 which I would've gladly paid.  But the guy came up to me and said, if you want that, you can have it for $5.  Umm, ok.  Sold.  Yay!  Kyle has a bike for now.  He LOVES it.  It's amazing what makes kids happy.  I mean, people always say to me, give them a new toy, they'll play with the box for hours.  Well, give Kyle a used Huffy, he'll love it like it was the shiniest most perfect thing in the world...lol.  I'm happy for him.

I also found a used car seat, which I know you're not supposed to buy at garage sales, but oh well, and a really cute eddie bauer knit shirt for me, and ughhhhhhh, this really cute Sesame Street remote control railroad set, that's complete and in GREAT shape!  I'm so excited!  Jack got 2 little Tshirts, too, I really wasn't in the mood to rummage through clothes.  So all in all, it was a great trip.  I spent $16 on all of that, and that includes a hot dog lunch for Kyle and a pop for me.  Can you believe that?  That's what I call success!

The rest of the day was the usual Saturday.  Kyle's baseball game, Walmart, and then sitting outside and chatting with neighbors."

Kyle was totally horrible at school again, nothing's working on him, no punishment phases him, so that's it.  I'm calling therapists tomorrow, and we will be finding out why he has to be such a brat all the damn time.  If this doesn't work, I'm going into hibernation for 11 years until he graduates and goes to college.  Either that, or I'm going to need some serious sedation.

Rick found out today that he's having knee surgery next Friday.  It's supposed to be a quick thing, outpatient surgery, 3 days to recover, and go back to work, no problem.  Well oh my god, he's got to be the biggest drama mamma out there.  Everything he says or does now is in dramatic fashion.  Get over it!  Suck it up and be a man!  It's simple knee surgery.  Quit telling me you might not pull through!  Goodness!  I actually had to set a ""milking"" limit on him.  He can only milk this for a week....LOL.

Of course, it's half our fault for not making sure he's brought it in for the night, but seriously, this is the 2nd bike in a year that's been stolen.  Last summer, it was stolen in broad daylight and our neighbors saw it, so we ended up getting it back.  This time, I know we aren't going to be so lucky.  I'm so pissed right now.  I'm more pissed about the fact that we can't even afford to buy him a new one right now.  That's what's frustrating.  He's had the damn thing for 5 months.

"event","at 2:49 today, I posted that I wasn't looking forward to Kyle being out of school.  About an hour later, the police were at my door.  It seems that my precious spawn grabbed one of Rick's golf clubs yesterday, and teed off in the backyard, right into the neighbor's garage window.  Isn't this just so much f'ing fun.  Not only was the cop a total dick, but the neighbor's are just as bad.  These are the assholes that were yelling at Kyle last year when he went over there to retrieve his balls.  Ha ha ha, yes I said his balls, let's move on.  They wouldn't give them back, that's how rude they are.

So today, I go over there, and I figured there's nothing left to do but kill them with kindness.  So I did just that.  UNTIL the jerk off told me that he used to like Kyle. Used to?  Now he says he's getting into too much mischief.  F off man, seriously.  Because a 7 yr old plays ball in the backyard?  Gee, the shame of it all.  I should be locked up for raising such a hellish child.

Now I admit, hitting the golf ball through the garage is bad and wrong and all that crap.  But when I went over there, I said, ok, this is easy, Rick does glass for a living, we'll get this taken care of no problem.  The old bastard says to me, it's not that big of a deal, I have another one over there broken.  Really, not a big deal.  But big enough to send a police officer.

Rick went to US Cellular this morning because his cell phone refuses to charge.   It's deader than a doornail, and we figured, ok, we're paying for insurance on these things now because last year I washed his phone with a load of clothes.  Insurance to me means that if something's wrong, it either gets fixed, or you get a new one.  Apparently I'm wrong this time. 

US Cellular informed Rick that the phone not charging isn't covered under insurance.  ??? It's not working, how is that not covered?  LOL.  Insurance only covers things like total destruction.  Well, ok then, looks like a funfilled day of running the phone over in the driveway with the van a few times.  That sounds way better than doing laundry all day."

I was talking with a friend the other day, complaining about finances, or lack thereof.  She said, ""I just wish I could go back in time to when everything was care free"".  I would love to do that, but I don't really want to be 6 again.  Seriously, I don't think life has ever been carefree for me. I met Rick when I was 19, and by our 1 yr anniversary, I was 3 months pregnant with our first child.  When I see young girls that are pregnant, I just can't help but feel sorry for them.  Of course I love Kyle with all that I have, but man that's young to have so many worries.  When you're turning 21, life is supposed to be about where you're going to party that evening, or who you're going to party with.  Rick was always really great about keeping Kyle for a few hours so I could go experience what it's supposed to be like, but it wasn't fun for me like it's supposed to be.  I had a constant worry thing going on thinking that Kyle wasn't being taken care of properly (he was) or that I couldn't get too hammered because I had to get up with the baby in the morning.

I guess my point is that I can't remember a ""carefree"" time in my life.  Rick and I have been together 9 years now, and it hasn't really gotten easier.  I'd really like to know when the whole ""living paycheck to paycheck"" way of living ends.  Actually, I think I know when it ends.  When the kids are out of the house.  Then there's the ""empty nest"" thing to deal with.  Ughh.  Life is so cruel."

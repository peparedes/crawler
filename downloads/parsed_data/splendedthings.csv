"event","Did a massive Friends cut today because I dont like all this stupid drama that is going on in the LJ website.  If you have anything to say to me you can tell me to my face instead of talking shit in the LJ's about me just to see if I find out and then getting all mad when I do and accusing me of going on peoples screen names.

I have friends that tell me what is being said in them wheather you like it or not people talk and I know.
No I am not going on anyones SN's because lets just face it people I dont know anyones passwords.  And on top of that we have alot of the same friends so ya there are my points for knowing things.

If you want to stay on my friends list let me know because I am going to do another cut when I get home.  

This is all petty bullshit and I dont like it.  It makes me really sad to know that people think that low of me when ALL of you know that I am not like that.  this is dumb and I dont think this is people being mature."

Donny promised Liz he would be at the airport.

Donny and Mark are now going to Six Flags tomorrow and staying the night out there.  

My friends make me cry.

Why do friends do that to one another?  Is it me?  Am I not a friend to them back?  

All I know is that I really wanted them to go and the outcome will be me being the bad guy even though I wasn't the one that did anything wrong.  They are the ones that did it to me.

I worst part?  I had to find all this out by someones live journal posts."

My mom makes these blankets for all of my nwphews and family.  Donnt has wanted one forever and I promised he would get one for him bday.  Well I helped my mom make one yesterday for Annie.  It has animals on it because well she likes animals.  I hope she liked it.  Donny found out that I made her one and got mad.  LOL I LOVE YOU DONNY AND YOU ARE GOING TO GET ONE!

Went over to Alicia's for a while and watched them do a Easter egg hunt.  Then left and went to dinner with my parents.  Its always nice having mexican food on Easter. HAHA!  

We left dinner a little early and went home to watch a movie.  I even told my parents that we were going to watch a movie.  SO at like 11:00 my dad calls my cell phone from the house and I answered.  He was all when are you going to be home?  I was like I am in my room annie and I are watching a movie.  He was like isn't your door supposed to be open and I was like I didn't realize it was shut.  SO ya he was all butt hurt that I had my door shut when I have it shut everytime annie is over.  So stupid.  Just something for him to bitch about.

Took annie home and then came home and went to sleep."

Last night I went to the library.  I told donny and mark that i wasn't going to go and they got all mad.  So I made sure to be there before they got there so surprise them.  they were happy that I was there.  I met a really nice guy that moved here from new york.  He has the heaviest accent.  It was really cool.  There were more girls there than usual last night.  Alot of lesbians.  

Right before we left this cute lesbian couple came up to me and was like not trying to be rude but how long have you 2 been together?  And I told them and we started talking.  I introduced them to annie.  They said they were going to be there next week so i am going to try and go and talk to them.  It will be nice to meet some new people.  Maybe double date or something.  

Tonight I am not doing shit.  I think I am going to stay home and get the rest of my room done.  If anyone wants to do something let me know.  i get off at 5.  lol."

Donny you will never be replaced though.  You have a special part of my heart that no one with be able to have.  I know we fight alot and more in the last couple of weeks and i am sorry for that.  We are both just kinda doing our own things and we aren't used to that. We are used to doing everything together and that isn't how it is anymore.  You have your friends and i have mine in a way.  But remember I love you and always will.  Can't wait for tonight it is going to be so much fun!  WHAT WHAT!"

"event","As I see that Pat likes to grace her presents into my journal and read ""my"" thoughts then I just wanted to say hello.  You see Pat these are my thoughts and my take on everything that I see in this world and one of those things is my girlfriend who I love more than anything.  So read this all you want because I already know that you only like to hear/read what you want to and not understand that rest.

The post about the ""stupid Bitch"" that I put in here is backed up on what happened that day at your house.  If you would have read THE WHOLE entry you would have probably understood why I was saying what I was saying.

Don't sit there and lie to Annies face and tell her that someone sent you my site.  THIS IS MY SITE NOT YOURS TO LOOK AT.  the only person that knew about it out of all the people that know Annie and I is annie herself.  I have never gave Theresa this link nor have I given her permission to read it.  So with that said dont sit there and play the victim.

You say treat elders with respect well to get it you need to give it lady.  I am not going so sit there to your face and be nice to you and then make stupid little hand motions behind your back like you little childen like to do.  Don't you have something better to do with you time then to act like a child?  

I have tried more then once to be nice to you and your other daughter.  You know the ""prize one""  the one that everyone clearly knows is your favorite.  You dont yell at her for coming home the day after she was supposed to be.  I dont see you yelling at theresa when she is saying the stuff she does to Annie.  Oh no heavens knows you wont do that to your precious little girl.  Oh wait and what about going to school?  Lets see here.  Whens the last time Theresa went to school?  You dont give her a hard time about it.  And on top of that Theresa doesn't even have a job.  At least Annie has that.  

If you want to critisize me about my own thoughts then do it.  I already know all the things you say about me and I know they aren't nice.  I know that I love Annie and that I treat her better in one day then you have done her whole life.  So please Pat save me and Annie the guilt trips.  It isn't either one of our faults.  The sad thing is its yours.

You are the one that likes to bring her down.  You are the reason she doesn't want to come home at night and cries herself to sleep.  Sad how I have to be the one hearing about it while you are yelling at her in the background.  When she can't sleep because she is scared and you can't just let her talk to someone to and feel better.  You just have to bring her down more.

I alread know that you are going to read this and freak out.  You are only going to read what you want to read and not anything else.  You are going to yell at Annie because sara wrote something bad about you in her journal.  Well this is my journal my thoughts.  If you dont like it then please feel free to not read it."

It is still kinda weird though.  I know it will all go back to being the same soon, I hope.  I dont know it just feels like there is still alot of tension.

"event","This goes along with the last post I did.  It was a comment Krista put and I think she puts it better then I ever could.  Maybe its because it even comes from someone that is straight and let me tell you it means alot to me.  Thank you Krista.  Donny I am not mad at you over this at all.  So here is Kristas response to what I wrote in my journal.
>>>>>>>>Krista>>>>>>>>>
Well, here is what I think, because Sara and I had talked before about this. Recently when we all went to Disneyland most of your heard about the black lady who like turned her kids around while saying ""dont look at the women"". Sara and Annie maybe had given each other a small peck and were just holding each other. Had that been a girl and a guy nothing would have happened. Everyone knows this.
Now on the contrary you say they were macking out and it bothers you. 1) Why would two people in love, deny their passion for each other, and you see straight couples doing it too. Yet no matter how rude it may seen, they dont ever get told to stop. 2) if it bothers you in public, but not in your car. Obviously its not them that are bothering you, but the people around you. That isnt their problem its yours. I know because honestly it used to bug me too, I hate attention especially when it can be avoided, but there comes a point when you just have to stop and think, ""why should I change because they dont understand?"" 3) not naming any names but we've both been around people that makeout at the dinner table, how come that was okay?
I guess I should just end it with this, I think Sara and Annie honestly have more courage that I ever could have.And what ever makes them happy makes me happy. And Donny I love you, please don't take any of this personally because you rock and its just what I think about the situation thats all."

We had a really long talk about what happened earlier that day even though she didn't wan't to talk about it I kinda made her.  Then it turn into a huge talk about us and everything.  Ended me in crying and her holding me.  I am glad she was there to hold me.  

Then we started fucking around and I bit her so hard she bruised.  LOL that was funny. 

Walked to Ralphs to get some ice cream for her grandparent.  Ralphs is right across the street and we ended up getting yelled at 3 times.  ""Get a room,  Homos, and some other one""  it doesn't matter but ya I thought it was pretty funny in the end.  

Her mom was there when we got back.  Oh joy.  They are so mean to her it pisses me off.  Everything is her fault.  I wanted to hit and and be like look what a great kid you have here and you treat her like shit.  fucking assholes.  I hated sitting there and watching that.  

Her mom started being a little mean to me.  Directing little comments my way.  I just laughed I thought it was really funny.  Stupid Bitch.  I am going to see Annie when I want and i am going to call her at night and tell her I love her and goodnight.  What the fucks the harm in that?  Im not hurting her or anybody for that matter.

I am glad he went home and is going to work it out with his parents.  He met a boy that is really good for him.  I can see this guy makes him happy and isn't going to screw him over.

Went to the movies with donny taylor annie and myself.  mark and karla came to the same movie and sat by us.  karla said something pretty rude and my girlfriend heard.  Lets just say annie wasn't in the best of moods after that.

Annie kept giving me kisses on the cheek throughout the movie.  We weren't ever making out or doing anything.  I was holding her in my arms.  Got that?  So when you make a stupid comment about moving to another seat directing your comment towards us.  Dont say shit and just get your ass up and move.  YOU CAME AND SAT BY US>>>  not the other way around.  Dont treat me like shit.  you would be doing the same if you had someone there with you that you were into or seeing.  

So besides that I had a wonderful time.  I love holding her in my arms.  Including when its a scary movie.  i want her to feel safe.  I hope I do that for her.  

Took her home and went home to go to bed.  Didn't sleep too much because I kept thinking about her.  I couldn't stop thinking about how much I love this girl.  She is the perfect match for me.  We joke around with eachother and rough house.  she knows how to make me laugh and she knows whats going to piss me off.  She respects me and treats me so well.  Hell she fucking offerd to pay for my ticket because she knows that I am not going to be ablet o afford it.  What girlfriend would do that?  How much I love her she will never know."

Friday- Went and saw Dawn of the Dead.  It was pretty good.  Went with the whole gang.  Mark, Donny, Dom, Theresa, Annie.  Darcey met us after the movies.  Went to Denny's but decided we wanted donuts so we went to a little store.  Fucked around in there for a while and then went to the Library. Chilled there for like 30 mins then went home.

Sat.- Woke up and went over to my girls house and layed with her for a while.  Watched cartoons with her and Krista.  Went and had breakfast with Darcey.  Then wanted Annie to come to my house and hang with me before we went to Disneyland.  She started acting really weird and would keep ignoring my phone calls so I started on my way over to her house.  In the process got a fun speeding ticket.  Got her and came to my house.  Rough-housed for a while.  Took Darcey home and went to Disneyland.

What can I say it was so much fun.  We didn't get on too many rides and we watched alot of the shows but it was the best time ever.  I wouldn't have changed it for the world.  And on top of that I got to spend it with the most amazing girl in my life.  We went and waited to watch Fantasmic and just cuddled and talked and it was so romantic.  Then the show started and it was great.  I bought her a rose.  It is so beautiful.  Then we went home and got Donny.  Chilled there for a while and then took Annie home.  Once I got home Krista was already asleep and one of Donny's friends was going to come over.  I went to be.  

Couldn't sleep most of the night.  

Sun- Woke up at around 7 but was still so tired.  Went with my sister to get some birthday gift.  Then went and picked up Darcey.  Came home and got Donny and Krista.  Went to Riverside to take Krista and then to San Bernadino to take Darcey.  Got home.  Went to the bday party for my brother and sister.  They all started fighting.  Came home and here I am.  So very tired and missing someone special to me.

No matter what she says or does.  Just even thinking about her gives me butterflies.  God how much I love this girl.  Everyday I keep falling more and more inlove with her and it is such a great feeling.  I had a little bit of a bad day yesterday and night but she made it better.  Just her texting me and saying the things she did made me smile.  Made my day a little better."

I told her that she is and that we have alot in common and have a great deal of respect for one another.  It was nice talking to my mom about that kind of stuff.

I grade all his papers for him and help him out whenever he wants me to.  And then yesterday he said some pretty mean shit to me and it ended in me on the phone with my mom crying.  Stupid fucker.

Got home from work and talked to Annie on the phone.  She wasn't in too good of a mood.  I didn't know what was wrong and all I wanted was for her to talk to me.  I dont think she can.  I guess I am not easy to talk to.  

Fought with her a little.  Started being a bitch to Darcey because I was upset.  Almost ditched her so that I didn't have to fighting about anything anymore.  I was just drained already and then that happened.  I wasn't in the right state of mind for a while.  

They both talked to me and everything turn out ok.  I am sorry to everyone that I was mean to yesterday.  I feel awful. 

Didn't go to work or school today.  Got sick and just didn't really feel up to going.  Yesterday was really hard on me.  I slept most of the day.  My dad told me that I was a fuck up and that we needed to have a talk when he got home.  Oh yay!  I'm just waiting in anticipation for that one.

Talked to a friend.  ""good afternoon insurance services this is sara.""  Good times with the phone voice.  I always thought is was easy to say but I guess not.  Took her about 5 times to get it close to being right.  

Supposed to go to get coffee on Tuesday and maybe the batting cages but who knows.

Went to the movies.  I love holding her in my arms.  Nothing better in the world.  I feel so safe.  So loved.  I get butterflies.

Chilled at home till around 3 and went to donnys.  Picked Annie up and then we and got some food with Mark and Chris.  I like chris he is really nice.  I kept calling him Pablo.  SO ya Pablo and I had a talk and it was really nice.

I love hanging out with my gang.  They are so wonderful.  Including because Donny and I haven't really chilled in a while so it was really nice to see him and hang with him

After golfing we decided to go to our friend Alicia's house for a while.  Donny wanted to get drunk so I got them some alcohol.  

I really didn't want to because Annie's sister was there and she likes to tell her mom everything.  I really dont need another thing added on the shit list right now.  I have enough as it is.  SO in the process of drinking donny got really fucked up.  I was getting a little stressed so I went into the other room and layed down.  Annie came with me and talked to me.  Made me feel alot better.

Donny started acting really funny and getting slammed.  He couldn't even walk or talk.  His mind was a million places.  He had to pee every 5 mins and he made me go with him everytime.  The worst part was he took a shit while I was in the bathroom.  WTF?!  It's all good though.  

He started throwing up at around 2:00 and didn't stop till well after 4:00.  I still had to take annie and her sister home and it was getting really late.  Donny thought it would be a bright idea to ride with me and get some fresh air.  I didn't drink so I drove.  He threw up all over the side of his car.  The whole way there and the whole way home.

Annie called me when I got home and we were talking.  I wasn't really in the mood to talk because donny was still throwing up and well I was just frusterated with the whole thing.  I dont like when donny gets sick.  It really scares me and I dont really know what to do.  So in the mist of the saga I told her I had to go to help donny.  She text me and said, ""you are going to break up with me again huh?""  My heart dropped when I read that.  NO I am not going to break up with you I just had a bad night.  Nothin against you at all.  

I called her and talked to her.  Donny's still throwing up,  marks laying on the floor and I am talking to my GF.  Mark got a little emotional and started crying.  He didn't like us all being sad. Poor guy.  Everything is A-OK my Markis!

Annie's mom called my cell last night.  She was pissed.  Theres another strike.  When am I going to get smart and just get them home when they need to be and not when they want to.  I am just digging myself into a bigger grave that is never going to get better.  When am I going to stop being a fuck up?

Im stupid."

I haven't hung out with him in over a week.  He IMed me today and said he missed me.  Then he says he came out to his dad.  I wanted to know what happened and he wouldn't tell me because he had to get ready.  Thought he was going to meet me at Denny's that didn't happened. 

Ended up at the Library with the boy.  Hmmm nice that he wants to talk to me about things now.  He didn't even hang with the group very much while I was there.

He would rather tell everyone at the Library what happened with is dad then talk to me.  It hurts so much because I would do anything for that kid.  I would die for him.  He means so much to me.  I have never tried to hard in my life to not cry infront of everyone then tonight.

Friday- Went to the Rebel Show with Mark, Krista, Alicia, Natalie.  Had a really good time embarassing everyone.  I was laughing really hard.  Tired from the night before so went to corona and went to sleep.

Sat- Got up and went to my work to wait for a check.  Krista worked on her project.  Joc and Mark met us up there and we ate lunch then went to the mall.  Went to Denny's with Annie and her Cuz.  Annie didn't feel too well but still wanted to go to Corona with me.  SO we went to corona and took and nap.  Just layed with eachother.  Got up and went and got Mark.  Had a little drama with Annie's fam.  Everything calmed down and we went to Krista's.  Annie got even sicker and felt like she was going to throw up.  Poor kid.  I felt bad because I couldn't do anything to make it better.  I just layed by her at Krista's.  She Threw up finally and started to feel better.  We left and went back to my brothers.  She started to get sick again so Mark and his friend Chris left so I could take care of her. She threw up most of the night so I tried to be there for her.

Sun- Woke up with her in my arms.  Layed with her for 2 hours and just talked and carressed her head.  Got her some Jello.  Yum.  Started on our way home.  Now I am home making some Mac and Cheese thinking about my girl and hoping she is feeling better.

I liked taking care of her.  I want to be there everytime she isn't feeling well.  I miss Donny alot this weekend.  I felt as though something was going on with him and he didn't want to hang with me this weekend.  Like he was made at me or something.  I hope everything is ok.  It makes me sad when he doesn't want to hang out.  Ok well I am going to eat and then take a nap!"

They were all going to Tigerheat and they wanted me to go but I wasn't really in the mood.  I didn't want to rain on everyones pararde.  Talked to Annie and she told me that I should go and have a good time.  Sepi really wanted me to go so I did.

I drove with Sepi and Jamie to the club and they got in a fight the whole way there.  Once we got there they started drinking hardcore and got trashed.  Sepi and I got along really well.  She is really cool.  Met a guy named Paul and he kept telling me he loved me.

Danced all night.  Jamie was all up on my grill and proceeded to bite me boob and cooch.  Then stuck his tounge down my throat.  On top off all that he went in for the kill and decided to suck on my neck.  I tried to push him away and say stop but that didn't work.  So I got a little mad at him but I am over it.  He was drunk.

I missed her so much last night.  I didn't get to see her yesterday and she was going through some shit.  I wanted to be there for her but I couldn't.  I get to see her tomorrow!  I am so pumped we are going to have fun.

It hurts alot.  

Got home from work and did a report.  Then talked to Darcey and went and got coffee with her.  Talked to her for a while and started on my way home.  

Donny stayed late at work and got off when Annie's movie got out.  They went to Denny's and I joined them.  I had a lot of fun.  Her cuz and sister aren't that bad when you hang with them.  I wish they liked me.  Oh well I will get over it.

Such a great feeling to be able to see someone for only 30 mins and they make your day better.  Just seeing her and talking to her and her giving me a hug and kissing me and making sure I was ok.  That moment in time made my day they best day it could be.  I miss her already.

It was nice seeing Darcey.  I haven't talked or saw her in a while it was nice to catch up.  Hope everything works out with her.  I talked way to much but oh well I dont care.

Yesterday was one of the funnest days of my life.  And it all happened in the car.  We had a throwing war between Donny's car and Marks.  Its was so great.  I didn't know it would be so much fun!  Donny threw and Ice Cream Cone and Marks car and it looked like his car was spotted.  So many good times.   Then we went to my work and decorated my sisters office for her Birthday.

Went over to Desire's and they were like oh well theres and after party at the strip club wanna go.  SO I said yes and we went.  It was ok.  There wren't alot of people there but ya they were making me try to pole dance and what not.  Donny had my phone and someone was calling it.  By then it was around 3.  Megan from LJ called me because I wrote to call me.  LOL that was pretty cool.  Felt bad because I could barley hear her or talk to her for that matter because Ed decided he wanted to give me a lap dance.  Went back to Dez's and played NEVER HAVE I EVER.  Got a little buzzed and went to sleep.  

Woke up and went to Jack in the Box.  Then to a movie.  Saw Margaret Chow.  Laughed.  Got ready for the night.  Donny wanted me to make out with Ed so I said ok.  That was interesting.  Sooo then Donny and Dez started drinking.  Went to a party. Got Donny a fake ID and went the the Rainbow Room.  A huge gay club.  It was so packed you could barely move.  DOnny got sick because he drank too much so we left.  Went home and I went to sleep.  

Got up and picked everyone up.  Started on our way home.  Rained the whole way there and the whole way back.  Its ok though.  It was alot of fun.  Missed Annie a lot so we went and saw her.  Went to Denny's and chilled there for like 2 hours.  Good times.  Went home and went to bed.

"event","I dont talk about Desire' too much.  I think because well I keep her really close to my heart.  She is the funniest girl ever and it seems everytime I talk to her she lightens up my day.  So night she decides to IM my cell phone at 3 in the morning and ask if I am awake.  LOL Who fucking asks someone at 3 if they are awake.  ONLY DEZ!  god how much I love that girl.  She is the greatest.  So in the events that happened last night and well I am thinking about her I thought I would write her a letter for her to read.  

So here goes..........

Dez,

There are so many things that come into my head when I think about you.  It's funny how we it it off the way we did.  2 girls in a chatroom not knowing eachother.  You rescued me from the bitch from hell that night.  That started it all.  The next day we chatted and then that night I was bored so I asked if you wanted to talk on the phone.  You surprisingly said ok.  That was at about 11 and we talked till 4.  There was so much to say and so many things going on in my head.  That was the day after I came out to all my friends.  I still remember you telling me that you had never smiled so much before.  Same here kid.  

I remember everytime you would call I would answer it a different way, hey beautiful or whats going on sexy.  It was so funny to hear you be taken aback by it.  We became instant friends that day on the phone.  You became a constant in my life.  Someone that I always thought about and always worried about when you had a bad day.  You were there for all my bad days.  The day my mom gave me the letter and you stayed on the phone the whole time with me while I read it.  You made that situation so much easier.  You made my life easier.  

You know about every girl I have had and every insecurity.  You know when I am upset, sad, pissed, well everything for that matter.  You read my mind and my thoughts.  You talked me through my irratinal stages and always tell me when I am being stupid.

The night I first met you was so crazy for me.  Driving through the night to get to Arizona as soon as I could.  Picking you up at your house at 2 in the morning and going to Denny's.  God I was so scared.  But then again so excited to finally meet one of the most important people in my life.  You mean the world to me.  That weekend was great.  Meeting Ed and having to pretend that I was some old friend.  lol He still didn't know you were bi.  That was good times.  Hey Dez!  You have taco bells here?  Good times.  Meeting Doug and having Steve sit on my lap all night.  

The last couple months have been hard on the both of us.  We haven't talked too much but that is ok.  You are always in my thoughts and whenever I really need you, you are there for me.  I love the late night phone calls just to say hi and vent.  I love the way you make me feel when I am having a bad day.  I don't know what I would do without you in my life.  You got me through some of the hardest times in my life.  

So in 2 days I am on my way to see you for the weekend.  Donny and Joc are coming as well.  Can't wait to see your smile and give you big hug.  I love you kid.  No matter who comes in and out of our lives.  It started with you.  You gave me the strength to be myself.  You gave me everything.  It will always end with you as well.  I am going to be there for you no matter what girl.  

So to end this little note (rather long) some inside humor.
FUCK YOU SARA.  FUCK YOU!
WHATS HAPPENING HOT STUFF

I LOVE YOU

Well I am here for you.  

I remember our trips to whittier last year.  How we would sing in the car and always hit up that taco bell on the way home.  We would get the grilled stuff.  me chicken you beef.  You would do that bubba talk shit and i would laugh so hard i would almost pee my pants.  Those were great times.  You have no idea how much fun those times were for me.  I love you kid.  I know you are having a hard time right now.  

Just remember that even if it gets so bad that you can't handle it anymore.  I am only a phone call away.  I will be there in a heartbeat.  Just think.... 3 days and we are in Arizona.  Living it up and we get to do our road trip yet agan.

"event","I have come to realize that sometimes friends need to stay out of certain situations.  If you have 2 friends that are having a problem sometimes you just need to let them work it out instead of jumping in a starting shit.

I.E.  If one friend is dating another but is still into another friend of yours let them figure it out.  Dont jump in a start making assumptions.  Some people will never get over other people.  It doesn't mean that they can't date anyone else.  On top of that its even more irritating when someone that has no clue what is going on in this little situation and then gets in the middle of it.  Accusing that certain people aren't good friends or rather awful friends for that matter.

Sorry to burts you little bubble but you dont even know what I am aobut.  You dont know what kind of friend I am or how much I care about people.  So before you start accusing me of not being a good friend get the facts straight.  And dont butt into other peoples business when you dont know jack shit about it.  Also if I would like to bring BAD LANGUAGE into a converstation then thats my choice to do so.  What are you now mr. prim and proper.  I dont think so.

With all the events that happened yesterday I am only upset at one person.  I.E. Not Markis.  I understand why you would be upset but I don't feel as though this thing that happened should have happened in the first place.  

So with that I am done.  Finished.  Finished with this petty fight.  Finished with certain people.  Finished with the people that open their mouths for no reason.  No matter what comes out of this petty game I am done.

For whom this may concern.  Date whoever you want to date.  No matter if in the end it does hurt someone.  Dont lie to yourself or anyone else.  If you do your are going to be the one hurting in the end.  Follow your heart and dont think so much.  If something feels right do it.  Dont lie cheat or go behind someone back.  Its your heart your playing the games with.  Dont make it a game with other peoples hearts.

Goodbye, Thank You, and Fuck You"

At least the ones that I consider friends.  They dont ditch me, forget about me, use me.  Whatever you want to call the friends that I have the walk all over me.  

I just talked to my Aunt.  How much I miss her.  I wish she was here so that I could drive over to her house and let her hold me right now.  Not in a very happy mood right now.  I want to cry.  I dont know why either.  My heart and head are a little heavy right now and I can't seem to breathe.  Just her talking to me on the internet was enough of a relief for me for a few short minutes.  

She actually cares about me and my relationships.  She wants to know whats going on and if my heart is broken or what not.  She is the only one in my little ""perfect"" family to care about that part of my life.  A very important part of my life.  SO sad right now.  

I am sitting on the computer typing this while all of the friends are in the next room.  My best friends are in the next room.  All the people that care about me.  All the people that love me except Krista.  Which granted I got to see her most the weekend and had a blast with her.  I love all of them so much but I am so sad right now.  What is wrong with me?  Why am I not happy right now?  I have everything I need in the world.

I have....

Donny- who is the single most important person in my life.  Without him I wouldn't know how to even breathe.  He is my life.

Joc- who knows when I just need a hug.  She makes me laugh when I am sad and she yells at me whenever I am being stupid.  She is my laughter

Mark- Just looking and this kid makes me smile.  He smiles at you and his heart warms up your whole body.  He is my smile

Krista- She knows everything about me.  She knows when I have something on my mind and I need to talk about it.  She knows what to do to get my out of moods and to open up.  She cares about my feelings and my concerns.  She is my soul

Greg- I have only met this guy a few months ago and he has become an important part in my life.  He is so funny and happy and graceful.  We have these great talks about life and love.  We vent to one another.  He is my constant.

Annie- God knows I have put this girl through so much shit and she is still around.  She shouldn't be, but she is.  She is an all around great person.  She is a great friend to have a so funny.  She is my heart."

"event","It's offical my parents are going out of state this weekend.  They are driving to Arizona to pick up a vintage car my dad and brother bought.  They wanted me to go and I said no.  I told them that I have plans with my friends for Valentines day.  I really want to go but ya I am going in 2 weeks so it doesn't matter to me!  

My mom told me that I better not do anything stupid while there gone.  haha now why would I do anything like that?  

Went to the Doctors and I had to fill out paperwork.  There was a question on there that asked if I drank.  My mom made me circle yes and then she made me write socially underneath it.  What a freak!  The last time I drank was winter break and I am so over it now.  I have been offered it a lot and I just dont want to.  And on top of that who really cares.  There are kids my age doing way worse.  So what I drank a little over winter break.  It isn't like I did drugs.  I'm not that stupid.  So ya that was pretty interesting.  

So I am now sitting at work pretty bored because it is slow today.  VEERRRY tired because I didn't get to bed till 3 this morning and had to wake up for school.  It's ok though I couldn't really sleep so Dez kept me wonderful company.

The last couple days have been a wirlwind of happiness for me.  i dont really know why but I haven't been this happy in a while and Eric noticed it.  I saw him last night and he said he was proud of me and that he can tell I am really happy.  So that is about it for me!  IM OUT!"

I am glad I talked to Her and that we straightened somethings out.  I hope that she takes what I said and grows from it.  I hope she shows that she wants to be my friend.  Thats all I want from her, I want a friend.  I want to be able to count on her and not always have to worry if she is going to cancel at the last minute or just never call.  

So here I am sitting at home looking at the clock.  Wondering when I am not going to be lazy and get up to get ready for work.  Didn't have school today so I got to sleep in.  It made me lazy.  I am not going to do that anymore.  

Feelings happier about alot of things.  I'm glad I have the friends that I have.  They always make me feel alive.  They all fill my heart.  I probably say this every post I do but it is true and I want them to know it.

Went and saw the perfect score last night.  Loved it.  Donny had to pee and couldn't go by themselves.  BOOTY!  Damn queer can't do anything by himself.

Saw Greg last night for a few.  We went and had dinner together.  I love you greg and I want you to get happier so that we can go to tiger heat and I can rape you on the dance floor!  HAHA I am so kidding.  I want to see your smile again.

Lets see what else happened?  OH YES!  Drama went on at my house on sat night.  Stupid petty shit where no one had the right to say anything they were saying because lets just face it.  Not everyone is perfect.  Everyone makes mistakes and everyone takes their relationships in different steps so no one should judge.  We are going to ruin some friendships if this stuff doesn't end.  We dont need to be shoving it into anyones faces.  

Well I am off now to get ready for my lovely job!  What is everyones plans for tonight because i have nothing and I really dont want to be home!"

"event","So today was a very good day.  I saw someone that I haven't really saw in a while and we got somethings out in the open.  I feel refreshed.  Happy.

I am sitting at Joc's listening to the laughter fill the air with Donny, Joc, and Annie.  How I love those kids and they don't even know it.  They just critises me for the friends I have.  

I talked to my friend on the phone tonight.  She is such and amazing person.  I am glad I got to hear her voice tonight.

I never get mad at the friends that my friends have.  I love them not matter what and I just want them to be happy.  Why can't they be happy for me.

THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR ME.  THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT ME.  I LOVE YOU GUYS DONT GET ME WRONG.  YOU ARE THE BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME.  YOU ARE ALL MY LIFE.

It tears me up when I hear the things you say about my friends.  I know that she hasn't been a good friend lately but I am going to let her try.  I am not going to get my hopes up but I am going to give her a chance.  I would do the same for you.

goodnight and I love you."

"event","All these things I need to do.  All these things I need to get over.  I want to be strong and be able to open up.  I want to open my heart to someone and have them do it back.  Not nessicarily in a relationship way but just in general.  Someone that can understand me and not get mad and yell at me if I say something stupid.  Whenever one of my friends has a problem or likes someone so much when other people think they shouldn't i listen to them.  I dont get mad at them.  I just understand.  I am there for them.  I want someone that can be like that with me.

Eric and I went to Her concert and then we went and got some food.  We talked for a really long time.  He just listened to me.  Let me vent and try to figure things out.  I have been thinking about so many things the last week.  I haven't been in the best of moods and that isn't good.  Eric just listened and gave some advice but never told me what you do.  Just suggestions.  He helped open my eyes to a lot of things.  That really meant a lot to me.

I really need to let some things go.  I need to be happy with me and not get down on myself.  I keep beating myself up over things.  I beat myself up over wheather or not i am a good friend or not.  Did I say the right things?  Did I not say enough?  Do they understand?  Do they accept me?  Do they want me in their lives?

Donny asked me to be his Valintine and Joc told me last week that we were going to be eachothers.  I dont think they realize how much that meant to me.  Sometimes I feel like I am just filling in space but when they do that I know that they want me around.  

When I am with my friends I can't be anymore happy.  I am truely that happiest I can be, but when I get home and I am thinking about everything I get so scared and insecure with myself.  I become some scared little puppy.  WHY THE HELL AM I LIKE THAT!?

I guess I just want to feel wanted.  I want people/my friends to see that I love them with all my heart and I would do anything for them.  I want them to know that all I want is the best for them.  I want them to be everything they want themselves to be and more.  My friends are my life and I dont know if they know that.  I seriously wouldn't be her right now if it wasn't for DONNY, KRISTA, JOC, MARK, CHRIS, DESIRE', ERIC, AND SOMETIMES DARCEY AND ANNIE.

Does that sound really stupid?  So much to ask?"

Going to Her concert tonight.  She wants me to go so I am going to.  My lovely friend Eric is going to go with me.  How I <3 that kid.  She dyed her hair last night.  I am interested in seeing what it looks like.  Talked to me about Kristina.  I am really happy for her.  She is very is like a little kid talking about her.  It is rather interesting.  But I am very happy for her.  Hope they start dating.

Trump is being funny today.  He wrote in my journal.  I can't type and he is making fun of me.  Stupid!!!!!

Anyways I am going to go now because I can't stop laughing and I still can't type. I am going to KILL HIM!"

Tonight I am going to either be watching my nephews or going with my sister to the airport to pick up my brother.

I dont know why my day is starting to go shitty.  I have been pretty happy all day until I got to work.  The stress is really starting to get to me today.  I usually dont let that happen but today is getting a little out of hand.

I hope it rains again tonight.  I want to play in it.  

I hoope work gets better.  I still have 2 more hours here.  If it doesn't I don't know whats going to happen."

Went and saw my Markis today.  Laughed alot with him.  Watched American Idol and laughed some more.  Some of those people are crack ups. 

Made fun of Mark a little which is always amusing.  Including when he calls greg, gregy.  I hope he didn't get mad though.  I was just kidding.

Tired, Stressed, Lonely- not a very good combination."

My friends are amazing.  They know how to make a person feel special.  I love them.  I have finally come to realize who my real friends are.  The ones that always make sure to be there and to make someone feel great.

Friday-  When I got off work I went to Krista's basketball game.  They kicked ass.  Joc went with me and she was laughing at this girl that was sitting next to us.  She wanted me to go pick up this guy from Fontana but he wasn't texting her back  so we just chilled at the game.  I told her we would leave at 7 but when that came around she didn't want to leave.  Then like 15 mins later she just got up and was like ok lets go. Very wierd.  SO we get in the car and head over to my house but decide to stop by Chris's that live right around the corner from me.  I walked into the house and I WAS A SURPRISE PARTY FOR ME.  Donny, Chirs, Joc, Jamie, Annie and Eric were there.  I felt so loved by all of them.  Darcey was supposed to come but what the fuck is new she didn't.  So we chilled there and then Joc got a hold of that guy so we went and got him.  Donny threw up on the way there.  So we picked up Tony, I call him Troy, and went back to the house.  Stayed up till 5 and went to bed.

Sat-  Woke up and went back to Fontana to take Troy home.  Joc went with me.  Picked up Krista on the way and then went to a Sizzler and a Movie.  Along came Polly was pretty good.  Good times.  Took Joc home and then went back to Riverside.  Went to a book store with Becky and bought some awesome books.  Tried to watch Wrong Turn with Chris and Liz but feel asleep.

Sunday-  Woke up and just layed around Krista's house.  Decided to get some food so we went to Jack in the Box for some food.  We grubbed on that and then we went to The Touch of Romance and looked around.  That place is very interesting. I was laughing at the names to some of that stuff.  It was very interesting.  Sat in traffic for an hour to get back home.  Went to a book store again and now I am home.

I dont feel good.  I have a headache and I am not in the best of moods.  I am sorry for anyone I snipped at today.  I am in a very odd mood tonight and I dont know why.

One another note I am going to vent-  I rather dislike fake people.  People that say they are you friend and would be there for you and then dont.  Someone that always finds and stupid excuse to not do something.  FUCK THAT!  People like that make me very angry.  I am so over it.  No more stupid little games.  If you were my friend you would have done everything to be there.   You knew it would have meant a lot to me.  Instead you just proved me right again.  My eyes are starting to open up.  I am starting to see the real you and it isn't making me very happy.  How sad how I thought of you as one of my close friends.  Like it matters to you.  You couldn't give a shit about you.  Thanks for being there for me."

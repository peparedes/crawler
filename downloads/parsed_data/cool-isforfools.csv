<P>haha i just read that and im being really melodramatic.<BR>but hey OH WELL its my fucking journal.<BR>get over it.</P>
<P><BR>on a side note...<BR>im going to use&nbsp; katies coffee analogy for my own life somehow. beccause i love her. and its a good idea. &lt;3</P>
<P>so, you're with your friends and you're getting some coffee. now, for those of you who have ever gone to starbucks with me KNOW that i ONLY get a caramel machiatto. because they are the love of mylife.... but. see this time you're not going to starbucks. you're going to some new place. that doesnt serve machiattos...now of course you could go through the trouble of explaining&nbsp; what it is you want, but before you can get the words out of your mouth... you see this NEW special&nbsp; that this coffee shop has.&nbsp; and you decide to try it. and its way better than your usual caramel machiatto. in fact, it makes your machiatto taste like dirt. but under the sign of this new, AMAZING coffee...it says...limited time only. while supplies last. now... sometimes they just say that to make you buy it more, but sometimes they really mean they're getting rid of the coffee. so you dont really think much of it, and you keep getting your new coffee. and you're really enjoying it, but then one day you go back. and read the sign again... and you're like ""shit. this coffee wont be here for much longer"" even though nothings changed....you realize what the sign means. it has no garauntees. it could be gone any day now. this coffee wont be here for you to enjoy in the future. so what do you do? go back to the boring caramel machiatto and learn to love it again? or keep on with the new coffee, that will only leave you empty in the future.... maybe?. of course you could alwasy ask the person behind the counter what they mean by limited time only... but who wants to do that?</P>

"event","well, i would like to start this entry of by saying that no one should ever allow me to go to wal mart by myself ever again. because everytime i do, i either get hit on by old men, or stared down by black people, or something equally as not fun.

now that THAT is out of the way, i can talk about my day... and apparently i can rhyme too.
uhm well it started with me getting woken up from BEAUTIFUL SLEEP at 1130 by my dad wanting me to take him to get food before the game. so... did that... got home watched the part of the iron bowl where Auburn was TOTALLY kicking Alabama's ass, got excited. texted my mom telling her my team was kicking HER team's butt, then went and got coffee/shopped at target with courtney. had a good time, because...we're like THIS *does finger motion that goes with that saying* lol. i bought this really awesome, but long, brown skirt and pink shirt and earrings. yeah. SPLURGE. ahem.

then i took her home... went and got katie and went to see Elizabethtown. and let me just say... it was AMAZING. and by amazing i mean.. WOW. yes. i loved it. and i cried, not really because it was sad, but mainly because i realized that i was watching myself on the screen. well, not REALLY, but... lets just say i related...uhm. and yeah. its definately going in my collection when it comes out on dvd.

anywho... before going into the movie, katie and i saw Alex Wright going to see a movie all by his lonesome...and also we saw him afterwards, so we invited him to the roof with us, and he came. and we went to Kenny Mango's aaaaand the roof...and though it was freezing, it was rather fun. :] then we visited emily and katie hall at Kenny Mangos again for a few seconds, i took katie home... and now im here. 

so it was quite an eventful day.
and im glad that it was. :]

Tomorrow: 
-lunch at Tenders w/ Katie
-HOPEFULLY chuck E Cheese w/Katie and maybe Alex
-BIOB/The Legacy/ Magazine Love show w/Hondu

anyways. mike's gone. 
not much to say about that.

i went to beffy's at about 5ish. or so
and we made dinner like we always used to on twin tuesdays.
lol :]
then we made ourselves look like twins by applying the same eye makeup.
and headed off to the show

Mike played first. and he's amazing...everyone go check him out
myspace.com/mikeburns
go buy a cd too cause, he's now my homecoming date :]


then i mostly chilled outside with hondu beffy mike and kt and andrew
while the screaming went on inside.
untill mcmb played. then i had to support my homedawgs. lol :]
then after the show everyone went to sonic.
and just had fun.

and now im going to go to sleep so i can wake up and learn how to play the drummies!

"event","tonight was... simply unexplainable.
it all started with an amazing episode of the oc.
yes, the oc can be very emotional, and tonight it was amazing.
and all of you people that hate it and think its stupid.
i dont care, bite me.

and after the oc, i went outside so andrew could drive me back to my car...
and you could see all the stars perfectly.
and it smelled like winter and it was just.... perfect.
because i love the smell  of winter.... especially on a day like today
where its just cold out of no where. or the first day of winter.
...love it...

and in the car we listened to deathcab and i reccommend that everyone go buy the new cd...plans
or at least listen to the song I Will Follow You Into The Dark because. everytime i hear it i want to cry, in a good way. 
because one day. someones gonna sing me that song. lol
<3


but its nights like these that it sucks to not have someone to come home to and curl up on the couch with... i miss that.



but anywhoo. like i said this night was unexplainable. so what i said didnt do the night justice.
but oh well. im off to applebees with big brother hondu and the lampwick boys i suppose? i dont really know who all is going.
but whatevz"

"event","I'm going to do this: [i stizzolei t from courtney]

Say 20 random facts about yourself:

1. I'm addicted to text messaging, livejournal, myspace, music,...pretty much anything having to do with my laptop, vanilla (lotion, body spray, pepsi vanilla...etc) mountain dew, and friends. lol yes. theyre addicting.

2.I keep a journal that i write in everyday...or almost everyday. As i read through it... i realize that i only write whats troubling me. because the happy things i share with the world. so if someone didnt know me, but read my journal, theyd probably think iwas one fucked up kid. But most of the people that know me would probably say i was a generally happy person. And from my prospective... i may be a little screwed up, but arent we all?... no ones childhood was perfect, and only we know exactly what we've been through. BUt generally... i think im pretty positive.

3. i turned that last fact into a novel.... which leads to my next fact... and that is...that i dont always think before talking.sometimes its good... and sometimes im just retarded. and sometimes other people get pissed and are stupid.

4. Obviously, i ramble occasionally.

5. i like music with feeling. most people just lump it into ""emo"". but whatever. its not all necessarily sad. i just enjoy actually feeling something that the writer felt when listening to music... to me, thats the point... of course there are exceptions... like...music that just makes you wanna get up and dance :]

6. im really out of shape. and this gay scene in the one act we're doing for theater is killing my legs/knees. im going to have HUGE thighs like i did when i played softball. damn. maybe ill actually loose some weight. cause yes, and i dont care what you have to say about it, but i need to.

7. almost every day i think about growing out my hair just so i can put it up in a side ponytail, because i do love the 80s. :] but then i remember how ugly i am with long hair, and how annoying it is, so i cut it. wooo.

8. i miss my chocolate cherry hair. it was amazing. and its my favorite color of hair ever.<3

9.im watching gosoford park right now so i can listen to british people talk. because i have to talk like that for the play. and i suck at it.so if you hear me speak british for no reason at all, thats why. oh, and ryan phillllllipe is pretty :] and scottish accents are hot. :x

10. i never sleep. ever. and it sucks because im always so busy. one of these days iim just going to wear myself out. and like pass out and die. lol. maybe not die. but ill probably sleep a whole day this weekend. haha.

11. i enjoy theater. a lot. lol. even though its quite tiring sometimes.

12. i like to sing, but think i suck at it, so i dont sing in front of people a lot, unless you sing a lot. then i probably sing around you all the time. lol. and its probably annoying :]

13. i want so badly to believe that there is truth, that love is real.

14. im a really big procrastinator. i always do things las minute. or not at all sometimes. i always manage to get it done though.

15. i regret being such a screw up last year. anyone who knew me then, knows what i mean. im glad ive found new, more...eh. healthier things to do with my weekends. and...even weeknights. *sigh*

16. my legs are too short compared to the rest of my body. lol. 

17. i wish i could draw. or paint. or write. or something creative.

18.im not good at finishing things. and im freaking ADD. so its taking me like a million hours to do this stupid thing.

19. sometimes i wish i was perfectly pretty and just like all the movie stars...cause well i wanna be one when i grow up, but then again i hate almost all of those people, because theyre stupid and snobby. but they ARE pretty. 

20. im freakin tired. and regret doing this stupid thing because.... im retarded...therefore ITS retarded.



now everyone go and do the same weeeeee!"

Well, we've all made our predictions, but the truth still isnt out. So if you want to see the future, go stare into a cloud. And keep trying to find your way out of that maze of memories. It all sort of looks familiar, but then you get up close and it's different. clearly. Each time you turn a corner, you are right back to where you were and your only hope is that forgetting might make a door appear. Is it your fear of being buried that makes you so afraid to speak? An avalanche of opinions like the one that feel that I am now underneath. It was my voice that moved the first rock and I would do it all again. So, I mean, it's cool if you keep quiet, but <FONT color=#99ffff size=4>I like singing</FONT>.So I'll be holding my note and stomping and strumming and feeling so very lucky. There is nothing I know except that this lifetime is just one moment and <EM>wishing will just leave me empty</EM>. So you can try and live in darkness but you will never shake the light. It will greet you every morning and make you more aware with its absence at night, when you are wrapped up in your blanket baby, that comfortable cocoon. So go ahead and loose yourself in liquor and you can praise the clouded mind but it isn't what you are thinking it's the course of history, your position in line. You are just a piece of the puzzle so I think you had better find your place. And don't go blaming your knowledge on some fruit you ate. Because there has been a great deal of discussion, yes, about the properties of man. <STRONG><FONT color=#ffff00 size=4>Animal or angel?</FONT></STRONG>&nbsp; You were carved from bone, but your heart it's just sand. And the wind is going to scatter it and cover everything with <FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>love.</FONT> So if it makes you happy, keep kneeling Mama, but I am standing up. Because this veil, it has been lifted. My eyes are wet with clarity. I have been a witness of such wonders. Oh, I have searched for them all across this country but I think I'll be returning now to the town where I was born. And I understand you must keep moving friend, but <FONT color=#66ff99 size=5><EM>I am heading home</EM></FONT>. I'm gonna follow the road and let the scenery sweeping by easily enter my body. I'll send you all this message in code, under ground, over mountains, through forests, deserts and cities. All across the electric wire, it's a baited line. The hook is in deep boys, there is no more time. So you can struggle in the water and be too stubborn to die, <EM>or you could just let go and be lifted to the sky....</EM></P>
<P>this one always gets me in one of those deep thinking moods. ha. wonder why. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>why are we always wanting what we cant have?...not so much CANT, but wont...dad's going to vegas this weekend. sarah's parents are out of town...who's up for some fun?...i know i could use some...ill be at my mom's all weekend. so&nbsp; party at her house ! woot. lol except. the dogs would attack you. :]&nbsp; anyways. im going to bed. because my neck hurts. and im sleepy. oc thursday! dancing thursday! scary movies thursday!!! picnic on friday, no dice, FOOTBALL, all on friday...saturday i see some swimming! and...maybe a show?&nbsp;and happy birthday to colin! and...sunday? who knows. call me. we'll figure it out, im sure :D<BR></P>"

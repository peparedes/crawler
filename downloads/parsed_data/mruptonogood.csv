So...a 70&#39;s day, heading into the 40&#39;s. Gas was $3.79 a gallon this morning...it&#39;s been creeping up the last couple of weeks.

No rain for a fair bit, so we&#39;re going straight out of last summer into next summer with an extra helpling of fire season.

Welcome to California, where the govenor thinks he&#39;s a hero for talking about reigning in the budget, but he champions a railroad that goes nowhere anybody wants to go. (rail travel being my prefered sort of 19th century transport for the 21st).

Otherwise, life is good.

Fra Ogood is back. He insists on serving me and I insist that he continues...this is known as a balance of power. He has the power to fetch beer...I have the power to consume same. Fair &#39;nough.

I have for you today, a one-time deal. For the amazing price of...um...lets get back to that, as said Mephistopheles.

I have said, on occasion, that I aspired to cook like a French grandma...or, to be honest, any grandmere. They don&#39;t measure..they just know. Ok..so, now, there is a new bar...a higher bar...or, as has been hummed, a higher love (go ahead ..sing it...I know you wanna).

I want to cook as well as a Lutheran church lady.

Stay tuned. I have two (one plus one) recipes that =WILL= rip the cotton drawers off of any church lady, Lutheran or not, in the grand &#39;ole USofA. Trust me...I also got a minor recipe, that I got of the net (truth to tell), that will also raise you up amongst the saints or whatever the equivalent is is you are an atheist, agnostic or other sort of dumb bastard.

and with that cheery note...( an F-sharp)..I give you a &quot;good night&quot;

&quot;Her majesty&#39;s a pretty nice girl but she doesn&#39;t have a lot to say.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her majesty&#39;s a pretty nice girl but she changes from day to day.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to tell her a lot but I gotta get a belly full of wine...

But, I suspect, y&#39;all figured that out already.

Ah me....

On an up note ( a slurring C to G, if you must ask....ok...actually there&#39;s a bit more to it. I don&#39;t actually slur a C to a G...but I have been asked to sing in that area and -then- leap an octave to cop a C, with an above G. It hasn&#39;t helped me in my happy place. Sorry...you asked)

I had a long day today. I ran through all (just about) North of the bay counties...Solano, Napa, Sonoma and Marin...ended up in the city: that would be San Francisco. I hate the city. Hell, I hate most all cities. I hate crowds, traffic, noise...just all that crap. -ANNND- I most especially hate driving past a sign that says &quot;Nancy Pelosi Drive&quot; (or something like that. That crone -really- pisses me off).

Speaking of useless politicians, anybody heard from fat Albert? My last echo of the prick was a statement ascribed to him that warned folks that a new dust bowl was about to happen. So, I guess that means we ought to brace ourselves to the inundation of squash and zucchini and all that crap that friends grow that nobody every actually eats. &#39;Cause when Fat Al says it, it must be so...the other way.

I am still loving that whole &quot;my body is a time machine that only goes one way...&quot; thing. I think it&#39;s cute and accurate, which are the same word except for an extra c, an&nbsp; r and a t.

I love California, except for the climate the people and the politics. I really want to be damn near anyplace else but here. My fear is that I&#39;ll die here. Truth is, I probably will. New Hampshire is my goal...I&#39;ll settle for Maine...shit....South Dakota is Maine without the lobster, and I don&#39;t care for lobster, so I suppose that might work out. Just anyplace but here.

You might be a wee bit trepidatious, but Stephen KIng has written a sequel to &quot;The Shining&quot; called &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot;. It is very good and, if you&#39;re paying attention, might explain&nbsp; a scunch about the author. It&#39;s not your freak-out-check-under-the-bed-in-case-of-ghosties kind of thing. He&#39;s back...and has been for awhile, but if you, like the spouse have dodged him &#39;cause he got to icky scary, trust me: it&#39;s safe to go back into the water.

But you&#39;re probably dealing with zombie nighmares, so if you don&#39;t get around to it, it&#39;s okay.

&quot;Some enchanted evening,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you may see a stranger.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you may see her laughing...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; across a crowded room,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and somehow you know
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (as strange as it seems)
&nbsp;&nbsp; that somehow you&#39;ll see her again in your dreams.&quot;

No sing along. But she haunts me ... and what might have been.

I am,&nbsp; and I ever remain,&nbsp; yours (yours, yours, yours, yours) *

The usual suspects are also the people who inhabit my dreams. My life is full of regular, as in oftenly frequented, folk. The others I refered to are those who terrorize me.

But, as Othello&nbsp; says, &quot;no more of that&quot;. (without the dagger....I am still way too Catholic for that).

Life is, on the whole, good. Gas is, at last glance, at $3.59/gal...and that -is- the cheapest I can find. It&#39;s damp here, considering it&#39;s a full blown drought, but, hey, it is what it is. I&#39;m lookin&#39; at 52F right now...at 12:15 AM...that isn&#39;t too bad. It is supposed to be winter. Where, by the way, is Fat Albert these days?

This isn&#39;t the way I wanted to come back: cranky. But I&#39;m here. Deal.

I&#39;m soon to be a gampa...or whatever your variant is.

Ok...from the top:

The un-named eldest is still single and still singular.

Muscles is married and parenting the soon to be next generation.

Mordred is out of state, visiting America, and discovering why I love this country (as opposed to California...which really is just a province of the failed Soviet Union...they just don&#39;t acknowledge it. Putin is welcome to it...just leave Uraine alone and we&#39;re square)

Queen Ogood is also out of state and finishing her college stuff. She got the whole &quot;california ain&#39;t America&quot; thing...so she&#39;s always going to be okay.

Girly-girly..went sideways on me. She went from flat-chested flautist, to penis-less pianist to racked-out wretch...back to whatever it is you become if you lapse into a &quot;failure to launch mode, but as a girl&quot;. (she is flat out amazing, musically...plays any instrument...sings...you name it..performs....and has no confidence...go figure).

My ride is now, officially, an old ride. I bought it in 1992 (I had to do the math). Twice a year, to prove how dependable it is, I put about $700 into it. That&nbsp; is still less than the payments would be...and my mileage is still near 24/gal. Also, to be honest, I can not afford a Tesla.

Doctor Who...kick ass.

I miss &quot;Leesa and Phrank&quot;. If you are out there....settled in Vermont...reach out. &#39;K?

Sage? Philosophermom? I miss y&#39;all.

I have no pun/joke to end with...just a suggestion: check out &quot;Falling Slowly&quot;...a tune from the movie &quot;Once&quot;. My musician, Girly-girl, has me learning it so we can do a duet...which is like a duvet, only warmer and less expensive.

I feel old...but that might be the bourbon speaking...

God bless

Give up? Well...the Doctor has his Tardis, Bill and Ted have their phone booth...all I have is this body...and yet....(dunh, dun, da...) they are all time machines. The only difference is this: my time machine only goes in one direction.

Why is this important? Well...if I had it to do over again, I&#39;d not have let 18 or so months elapse betwixt postings here. But that, as they say, is one more planet bigger than Uranus.

Or to put it another way..I locked myself out of my own blog and over thought it...

Or...think of it this way: I&#39;m Randy Quaid in Independance day, at the end where he flies up into the attacking base ship, announcing, &quot;Hello boys, I&#39;m ba-aack&quot;, with wild, squirely eyes. Yeah...that&#39;s me.

I&#39;ll pace myself here. I want you to rebuild your tolerance for me rather than go all Belushi and od after just one hit.

This is a Martha Stewart &quot;good thing&quot;. Of all my kids, this is the first. So, for all that I =think= I&#39;m doing well, there are several kids who didn&#39;t take to whole traditional thing. Still, as a consolation, the others are overtly gay and none of them have produced progeny, for whom my saintly mother would have had some words of &quot;dis-approbation&quot; (you are welcome).<br /><br />By the way, I came across a kid who didn&#39;t know what a &quot;Mobius strip&quot; was....even without the oumlaut. This was a sad moment for me. But, being a hero, of a sort, I overcame and made him one...explained about it&#39;s uniqueness.....and&nbsp; Mobius. He is now a better human being because of me ....and I can rest peacefully for it. Or not.<br /><br />Try this: Check out my recipe for pizza dough, or any recipe you like.<br />Here&#39;s the kick: After first rise, freeze it. Then, when you&#39;re ready, defrost it...depending on dough ball size, 3-4 minutes in the microwave, turn and repeat....THIS IS AT DEFROST LEVELS....Not cook, K?<br /><br />Anyhow....after that, if it&#39;s thawed all the way,&nbsp; let it rest at room temp...that cold shit is hard on the fingers.<br /><br />When Ready, roll out the dough to @ 1&quot; or there abouts. Place on aluminum foil, on a cookie or baking sheet. Cut the dough into @ 1&quot; strips...take olive oil and brush the whole mess...sprinkle garlic powder....sprinkle (lightly) dry basil, and if you&#39;re feeling festive, some of that dry parmesean crap in a tube/can. bake at 400 to 450F for 8-14 (you -haveta- check so it doesn&#39;t burn, K?).... then serve with some caned or bottled pizza sauce as a dip.

It&#39;ll have to do.<br /><br />So...what have I been doing while hiding out? I&#39;ve gotten a larger &quot;Route&quot; or area of operations. I now roam over 4 North Bay counties with the odd trip into San Francisco. That has eaten up a wee bit of my days. I have one fewer chicklets in residence as Queen Ogood has moved off to a college. The slack has been taken up by Girly-girl Ogood, who has availed herself of my driving skills...if y&#39;all know what I&nbsp; mean.&nbsp; She has added some additional musical lessons, amongst other things, to her weekly schedule.<br /><br />Oh...and I avoided death.<br /><br />Hmm? Oh...yeah. Well...it&#39;s not really as big as you&#39;d suppose. It seems like I was pretty sure that I was in the queue for the crypt. I just could tell from the &quot;sensations&quot; I was experiencing. I frequently self diagnose, doncha&nbsp; know. Anyhow, I knew that I couldn&#39;t take off time to have this (or these) problem(s) addressed &#39;til summer. So I waited until I could schedule time off for vacation. During this time I went to see my M.D. (&quot;Doctor, doctor...tell me the news...I got a bad case of...&quot;). The upshot of that visit was &quot;Here, take a pill and call me one of these days&quot;. TaDA! I ain&#39;t dead after all. Yet.<br /><br />Just so y&#39;all know, I have been blogging...just not on/in a visible medium. I&#39;d do my typing mentally..a sort of &quot;think system&quot; for communication. (It still has bugs, so try this at your own risk)<br /><br />So..there you have it...all with a bow and a sheepish &quot;sorry&quot; stuck on at the end.<br /><br />Pax Vobiscum.<br /><br />Mr. Upton Ogood</span><br />"

Somewhere along the way I, accidentally to be sure, mentioned a slight problem I have with her and budgets. Ever so slight. Minor. Personal bugaboo but teensy. While her response was not entirely &quot;fuck you and the horse you rode in on&quot;...it was close. Go figure.<br /><br />So...that's how I&nbsp;turned a fantasy into a fist fight. <br /><br />Oh...she still went out and bought me beer. I&nbsp;consumed same and watched episodes 27 and 28 of BBC's <em>Torchwood</em>. <br /></span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br />In other news....The Ogood traveling circus and cluster fuck will be on the road this coming week. We are Tahoe bound. Much money will be wasted, brain cells will be destroyed and a very new sex toy will be broken...or at least broken in. Hopefully many knots will be tied, screams and moans will be muffled and vision (not mine) will be impaired. (We may be old, but we're still kinky). <br /><br />I&nbsp;will attempt to photographically (is that still the correct term, now that pictures are taken electronically?) chronicle the week.<br /><br />By the by, I&nbsp;had a marathon of George Martin and Terry Goodkind. I&nbsp;just couldn't pick up anything &quot;new&quot; to read, so I hit up Tom Clancy's &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;&nbsp;(still very good) and Stephen King's &quot;The Green Mile&quot; and &quot;Tommyknockers&quot;. I just a hand-me-down copy of the most recent George Martin thing, &quot;A Dance of Dragons&quot;, and Felashe just came in with an arm load of library books which contained an Andre Norton that I'd never read. So, even if I don't wind up having a shit load of sex, I'll still have something to read while I'm not having it. Cool, no?&nbsp;Si. Tres beans.<br /><br />Sing along:<br /><br />&quot;Three stars will shine tonight. One for the lonely. That star will shines it's light each time someone sighs. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three stars for all to see, one for young lovers. That star was made to be the light in their eyes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for the third star...only one reason. A star you can wish on to make dreams come true. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; High in the sky above, three stars are shining.

A bit unseasonable, so I guess it's all that global warming. <br /><br />Yeah, yeah..I know...It's an old song that I've sung once too often for some. But still....the latest that I've heard is an explanation that the <strong><em>real reason</em></strong> we haven't experienced global warming, at least here in the continental lower 48, is that the excessive carbon footprint of those dastardly Chinese, Indians and other emerging powers is so ...ugh... dirty.&nbsp; You with me on this?&nbsp;<br /><br />The reason we haven't seen global warming is <strong>because</strong> of<strong> pollution</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok....I'm gonna give you a minute to work that out. Ok...take your time. I'm patient. <br /><br />*****************<br /><br />Yeah. I&nbsp;can see by your crossed eyes that that datum does not compute. Here's another jewel, that, maybe, you haven't heard about. It seems that the sun (big glowing thing that hurts your eyes when you're hung over....yeah that thing) is begining a cyclical period of diminished sunspot activity. That is to say this period is one of cessation. No, or minimal, sunspot action. <br /><br />As the primary source of energy for our solar system, the sun, which will continue to glow (you have to trust me on this) is going to be just a tad less volatile. <br /><br />&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;<br /><br />Ok...back to the Chinese:&nbsp;So...I'm thinking that they are putting out, and not in the good way, so much pollution that they've broken the time-space barrier. They are damaging our planet so badly that we've actually transported a portion the the U.S. back to 1930 and that area is now experiencing dust-bowl weather. Just makes you wonder:&nbsp;who polluted us into the first dust-bowl. OR, could it possibly be, that that kind of regional weather is cyclical?&nbsp;Which is also to say normal. <br /><br />Just a thought.<br /><br />You're welcome.<br /><br /><br />*************<br /><br />Ah me. I'm having daddy-blues. <br /><br />About an hour ago, my youngest, Girly-girl Ogood, brought home a boy. She wanted to give him a bit of lunch and a soda. Fuck me. She introduced this guy...somewhere between 16 and 23....ok..closer to 16...but still. He's a average to tall, dark muscular good looking kid. He said &quot;Pleased to meet you, sir&quot;, while taking my hand in a manly sort of strong grip, looking me in the eye. Aw shit. I&nbsp;hate when this happens. I get very angsty about my girls. <br /><br />Yeah....Freud is having a party. Well...fuck you, Sigmund.<br /><br />**************<br /><strong>Update of an update: After thinking it over, the crap I posted about my trouble with John Barrowman of &quot;<em>Torchwood&quot;</em> seems like a bunch of crap, so I deleted it. <br /></strong><br />*****<br /><br />Did I&nbsp;ever tell you about the Irish magician?&nbsp;Walking down the street one day, he suddenly, poof, turned into a bar. <br /><br />Rim shot.<br /><br />*******<br /><br />Sing along...<br /><br />See the U.S.A. in a Chevrolet.

I'm using George Hayes as my icon pic dealy just because, 1) I like Gabby Hayes and, 2) I love character actors. <br /><br />So....here's to character actors everywhere and everywhen and George &quot;Gabby&quot;&nbsp;Hayes in particular. <br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />Life is good. <br /><br />Gas in under $3.80/gal. (I -think- I saw that it was $3.67 at my local el cheapo today). It's a damp, 67f just now at 1pm on the left coast; a charmingly bizarre temperature for June. <br /><br />We've had an odd spring this year. It's been very wet and cool. Not terribly cold. Just unseasonably cool and wet. We had a couple of 90 degree days as a prelude to summer and then, unaccountably, reverted to spring weather as though we clutched at it to prolong it or something. At least the reservoirs are full for a change. <br /><br />Last year we had a very pleasant summer. The entire summer. Pleasant. 70's and 80's. Every day. Funny thing. Grapes don't do well with just &quot;nice&quot;. They need those brutally hot days that I dread. They need that high heat of wind-less, oppressive, brain-baking temperature...that sort of hot concentrates the sugars in the grapes that allows them to generate great, or near great, wines. We didn't get that last year. As a consequence, there were quite a lot of grape fields that were just abandoned at the end of the year. Grapes just left on the vines. It was too expensive to pick them and no market for them. For all you oenophiles, this is bad news. Fewer bottles means higher prices and the possibility that the quality may be poor. We had a gang-buster spring, it seems, with the vines going, characteristically, wild. This is a good thing. No frosts this year. Also a good thing. No bright, hot sunshine..not so good. FYI and FWIW.&nbsp; You're welcome.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />More fun in the sun in the Golden State:<br /><br />The circus came to town or, as you out-of-state types would say, the legislature is in full flower. Once again we have a divided bunch. Mostly Democrats but not the full 2/3's needed to pass a budget. This year the minority Republicans, in total fear of we Tea Party types, has held firm to their pledges of no new taxes without budget cuts. Great fun. When a Dem budget was passed the governor vetoed it. But,even better , the state's Treasurer's bull-shit meter pegged out an he declared that the Dem's effort was entirely smoke and mirrors and, as a consequence, he stopped paying them. Ain't we got fun?&nbsp;A referendum, passed by the voters last year, gave the Treasurer the power to withhold the legislator's paychecks until a budget was passed. Lots of fun going on here. <br /><br />Oh, by the way, California, if you haven't heard, went tres, tres retro and elected (re-elected?) good old Jerry &quot;Moonbeam&quot;&nbsp;Brown. He is trying to reinvent himself as a moderate lefty and, so far, he's doing an adequate job as long as you don't watch his lips move, if you know what I&nbsp;mean.<br /><br />Stay tuned. It's only just begun (and I hope that tune does not get stuck in your head. especially if you can hear Paul Williams singing it).<br /><br />---------<br /><br />I&nbsp;may be having sex for the first time with somebody else actually being a participant. This is, if not good news, at least novel. It's been nearly a year. I do believe I&nbsp;can use the change, don't you?&nbsp;(Non-affirmative responses will be ignored....you fuckers) ;-)<br /><br />---------<br /><br />I'm shedding rug-rats like I'm shedding hair. This fall I'll be down to only one in residence. Nearly empty nest. I'm looking forward to it. Felashe is less enthused. Being home, alone with her, appeals to me. Perhaps the converse does not for her. I'm guessin' that we are observing the whole &quot;slings and arrows&quot; thing in application. No outrageous fortune, just natural progression. <br /><br />=======<br /><br />I was driving the youngest into town this morning. (That would be Girly-girl Ogood, the former flat-chested flautist, now the penis-less pianist). There was an ambulance coming down the &quot;main drag&quot; on the opposite side of the street. I&nbsp;saw it coming in the distance, lights flashing, and said to her, &quot;Oooh....Ernie, ernie, ernie&quot;. She replied, &quot;....?....&quot;. &quot;You know&quot;, I explained, &quot;Ernie, ernie...the sound that it makes?&nbsp;OOOH! and if a fire truck comes along then it'll be &quot;burnt and ernie&quot;....&quot; Her smile, while not audible, was nearly as good as a laugh or a grown. I'll take it. Feel free to use this joke on kids any time. Once again, you're welcome.

I don't know about you, but when I&nbsp;woke up Saturday, I thought..&quot;<em>aw crap, I&nbsp;didn't make the cut&quot;.</em> I&nbsp;did a little research (I asked somebody) and found out that the kickoff was supposed to be for 4:00pm, West coast time. Okie doke...I'm back in this. So, like any red-blooded, all-American hero type, I took a nap. If it was going to be lightning strikes and thunder, I'd just as soon get the good news when I got there, if you know what I mean. Once again I woke to disappointment. I&nbsp;was not drafted for the &quot;A-Team&quot;, first string or anything. I suppose I can do a walk-on for the minors and hope to get picked up. <br /><br />Uh....wait....there seems to not have been a draft at all. Hmm. Ain't that a kick in the head. I even read all 10 of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books as research, which I&nbsp;had to do as Roman Catholics don't actually have a rapture in their play book. It turned out to be another &quot;all dressed up and nowhere to go&quot; things. <br /><br />Ah well....at least this ain't Viet Nam in the '60s either. (another party I went to)<br /><br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />Ok...so I won't lie. I haven't taken the last year-ish off to study up on religion. What have I been doing?&nbsp;Composing blog-posts. No shit. Really. The way I used to do this, I'd get a topic/theme thingy and sit and type and hope that someone would care.&nbsp; Well....in practice, what happens when I get a topic thingy that I don't want to share or feel that I&nbsp;have to so self-edit that I'm telling a lie by omission, I just don't do it. Simple as that. <br /><br />Here's the thing: I&nbsp;had gotten, pretty much, to the point that, with the things going on in my life, my choices were limited to:&nbsp;A) suffer slings and arrows and press on. OR B) avoid s. &amp; a. and run. To put it another way, I&nbsp;could sleep in the bed that I had made or go bed-less. I&nbsp;had, when last I wrote, gotten to the sane conclusion that I'd -have- to suck it up and live with what I had created. It seemed reasonable at the time.<br /><br />But then the old Upton spirit moved, muttered, mumbled then mewed..&quot;<em>uh, really?&nbsp;why?&quot;</em> Contrarian to the end, or at least beyond the middle. <br /><br />Ok. So all I have to do is figure out how to put the wheels back on this thing, save for the part where the thing seems to like being wheel-less and resists being reshod, as it were. It truly is a puzzlement. <br /><br />Shall we dance?&nbsp;<br /><br />Resolution?&nbsp;Nah. But at least I've defined the problem. (That doesn't help much, but it did give me something to do while feeling like shit...so that's something).<br /><br />Lots of internal conversations over the last year. <br /><br />This morning over the Sunday papers, I&nbsp;heard &quot;<em>I&nbsp;think your hair is on fire&quot;. </em>I&nbsp;might be off my game some, but I did translate that. I&nbsp;patted my head and asked if that got it and heard &quot;<em>I don't see any smoke or flames so I&nbsp;think you're good&quot;. </em>I&nbsp;remarked &quot;nice control of panic there&quot;. This engendered a bit of not-quite-endearing banter. We ended with the declaration, &quot;<em>I&nbsp;would have put you out&quot;</em> at which point the internal conversation went all speculative with &quot;I wonder what that means&quot;. <br /><br />And so it goes.....<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Saw a blog entry with a bumper sticker that read (more or less):<br /><br />&quot;<strong>You voted Obama in to prove you aren't a racist. Now vote him out to prove you aren't a moron&quot;.<br /><br /></strong>I liked it.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />It's been a cool, damp spring here in the Sunshine state. We had a couple of days of 80-ish days in late April and early may, but it's been mostly cool, cloudy and otherwise New England in March, if you know what I&nbsp;mean.<br />It's 61f at 11:00am with a wind-chill of 57 (20mph <em>breezes). <br /><br /></em>About a week ago I&nbsp;was paying $4,13/gal for cheapo gas (4.19 by card). Today it's 3.99/gal. <br /><br />We have expensive gas, Iranians don't show either fear or respect and the economy is in the toilet. I&nbsp;told ya so, but this is what Jimmy Carter felt like in 1979. <br /><br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />Two shots and a splash!

You're welcome).<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Sing along:<br /><br />&quot;Her majesty's a pretty nice girl but she doesn't have a lot to say.<br />&nbsp; Her majesty's a pretty nice girl but she changes from day to day. <br />&nbsp; I&nbsp;want to tell her that I love her a lot but I've got to get a belly full of...&quot;<br /><br />Mr. Upton Ogood. <br /></span></span>"

I&nbsp;heard from a local pal that there continues to be a concern for the effect of this law via &quot;racial profiling&quot;. I&nbsp;am not, and do not suggest that I am, a professional writer. As a consequence, my ability to express myself is limited. If I&nbsp;have given offense, or caused you to think that I encourage racial profiling, or worse, that I dismiss such concerns, then the fault lies with me. <br /><br />Let me put this to you this way:&nbsp;I&nbsp;think that the silly business we all put up with in Airports is a necessary evil. I&nbsp;don't think anyone would think that I am a potential terrorist by looking at me, but I&nbsp;accept that, because appearances are deceiving that it is necessary to insure that I am not carrying a gun, a knife or explosives or drugs ...or whatever the hell they're looking for. In likewise, I don't think it an excessive burden that someone who does look like a terrorist (middle Eastern, 18-35 year old male) has to do exactly what I have to do in an airport. To put it another way, what they do to me they do to everyone. <br /><br />In the U.S., trying to get over the sin of slavery, we've acquired a huge fear of doing anything that might involve appearances. We can't stand the idea that someone is getting rousted because of the way the look. Ok. I&nbsp;get it. The solution, is either to ignore everyone or to treat everyone to the same treatment. Two extremes that have extreme consequences. <br /><br />Bottom line is this....if you're here legally, but you think you might get stopped, carry your green card, license, passport or whatever. Easy-peasy. Besides, if you aren't a citizen, you are required to carry the aforementioned anyway. <br /><br />I&nbsp;hope that clarifies. Again. I&nbsp; apologize.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />An update:&nbsp;I&nbsp;said that I thought it was silly that the white house's first affirmative action to the oil spill was sending lawyers. It seems I was wrong. It turns out it was a great idea that only suffered in it's execution. It seems that the W.H. didn't vet the lawyers they sent. When they were taken out to the site of the spill and thrown into the water to be used to plug up the oil well, most all of them bobbed back to the surface and began swimming away. Had the W.H. found non-swimming lawyers to begin with, this problem would have been solved much earlier. <br /><br />----------------<br /><br />I&nbsp;have just heard that B.P. may have stopped their well. Rumors that they used their own non-swimming lawyers to accomplish this is being neither confirmed nor denied. When questioned about this, B.P. referred all questions to their legal representatives. No one at the law firm, however, was available to return the calls. <br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Sing along:<br /><br />&quot;Sweet dreams be yours dear, if dreams there be. Sweet dreams to carry you home to me. I&nbsp;wish I may and I wish I&nbsp;might, now good night...&quot;<br /><br />Mr.&nbsp;Upton Ogood<br /><br /></span>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium;"">....which is a reference to the pic-icon thingy. <br /><br />Yeah...you can tell I'm in a cranky place today....it's what comes of reading the friggin' papers. Don't try that at home. <br /><br />I know. I&nbsp;know. You hate it when I go political. I've tried to avoid it. But I've decided you get me, warts and all, as I am which includes opinions on stuff you may not care to read. Feel free to shine it all on.<br /><br />So...what's got me going?&nbsp;Most everything. But, at least for now, the Louisiana oil spill and illegal immigration.<br /><br />Seems like everyone hates the Arizona law that deals with illegal immigrants. The complaint is that it might lead to &quot;racial profiling&quot;. Lots of Washington insiders denounce the law...but then sheepishly admit not to have read it. At that special?&nbsp;From what I can glean, the law specifically makes it illegal to &quot;racial profile&quot;. What it does do is enforce Federal law. The original law, set down around 1940, made it mandatory that all immigrants carry their papers with them at all times and in order to identify their legal status in the U.S.. In 1986 and again in 1996 (with revisions), the congress empowered the states to enforce this, and other immigration laws, with the intent to support, the then, I.N.S. (now I.C.E.). Arizona's law states that when somebody is stopped for any legal reason the law enforcement officer may, if he/she judges the subject to be suspicious, ask for proof of legal status. Since legal aliens are already required to carry these papers and surrender them for review at any time, this is no extra burden. &quot;suspicious&quot;&nbsp;would be anyone without a license, without any English or some other indicator. This is all pretty common sense. <br /><br />So...after slamming the law, and this includes being lectured by the Mexican president, Obama decided to send 1200 National Guard troops to &quot;support&quot; the border enforcement effort. They join about 350 troops already in the area. Lets do the math. Total troops: less than 1600. Just for fun, let's round this to 1600 for ease of operation. Let's divide 1600 by 4. This gives us 400 troops per 8hour shift with one shift off to provide a rotating schedule that will cover a seven day work week. 'K? That work for you? So...we have 400 guys to help out on a 2,000 mile border. 2k divided by 400 equals 5. That means that each troop would watch a 5 mile stretch. Does that seem very helpful to you, bunky?&nbsp;Nah...me neither. <br /><br />When the oil spill happened, the first thing, besides go on vacation, hit a couple of fund raisers and do commencement speeches...I&nbsp;mean...you gotta have priorities, yanno....anyhow...the first thing Barry does is ... what?&nbsp;Why...He has D.O.J. send a huge bunch of lawyers to Louisiana. Geez. That's what you'd do, right?&nbsp;I&nbsp;mean nothing screams for a handy lawyer like a deep sea oil accident. <br /><br />But, in both cases, while nothing actually gets done, you get to feel better 'cause, gee, he's on the case and doing everything he can. I'm feeling much better. How 'bout you?&nbsp;Oh...I forgot....you elected him...so information isn't all that important. <br /><br />Never mind. <br /><br />Look. The well is more than a mile under water. The&nbsp; oil is more than....well...it's hella deep. When an accident happens, it's not easy to fix. What do you expect?&nbsp;But more, you should be asking, why the fuck are they drilling way the fuck out there?&nbsp;Ah...now we're getting there. Work it out. You'll get there on your own. <br /><br />Sing along...<br /><br />&quot;Good morning America, how are ya?&nbsp;Don't you know me?&nbsp;I'm your favorite son!&nbsp;I'm the train they call....&quot;<br /><br />Mr. Upton Ogood<br /><br /></span>"

It only took us 6 years to notice that they weren't breathing anymore. <br /><br />Still...for all that...it was a very satisfying thing. <br /><br />Tonight I say goodbye to Jack Bauer. <br /><br />Heroes is creeping into the shadows.

If a show has &quot;legs&quot;, I'll play catchup on NetFlix the way I did with Battlestar Galactica. The way I did with &quot;24&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. I really can't see how a network can ever, with a straight face, offer a compeling, intricate drama ever again because they can't predict it's acceptance...and therefore they'll avoid them like the plague....or at least throw 'em out there, and if the stink the place up, pull 'em and screw you fools who watched. <br />Well...it ain't me babe...no, no, no it ain't me babe...it ain't me you're looking for ......babe.<br /><br />Hat's off to Lost and to 24.

Man-oh-man...he is really a marvel to watch...when he isn't out of his mind. <br /><br />In other good-news-from-the-movies, I&nbsp;saw an old talkie version of &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot;&nbsp;with Paul Robeson as the undercover prince. Very early/mid 30's. What a great voice in such a politcally naive man. I&nbsp;guess last night turned into a retrospective on politics of the past. <br /><br />Funny how it all works:&nbsp;Seeing that old movie made me think about another movie I saw. It was called &quot;The Tunnel&quot;, from around 1935. I've only seen it once, but it still moves me to think about it. I&nbsp;guess that's what movies are&nbsp; supposed to do. <br /><br />There's a smile on my lips and a song in my heart and I haven't even had my first of the day. How's that for a turn around?&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;The South side of Chicago is the baddest part of town and if you go down there you better best beware of a man named...&quot;<br /><br />Mr. Upton Ogood<br /><br /></span>"

(If you see the old 1950's version of &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;&nbsp;with Michael Rennie, Heater is one of the venerable news commentators...yeah...he was an old guy in 1950). <br /><br />Anyway...Heater used to open his radio broadcasts with &quot;There's good news tonight&quot; and he was on my mind. Go figure. But, back to the news: <br /><br />I bought a 30 pack of Bud Light for $17.99 ...and it had a $6.00 coupon for a rebate. My 30 cost me 11.99. Very sweet. <br /><br />I&nbsp;saw a John Garfield movie last night. It was a 1943 propaganda piece. It featured Walter Slezak. It also featured a very young Maureen O'Hara. It was a very noir period piece about a veteran of the Spanish civil war. Anyhow...it's a semi-mystery with Nazis lurking in the corners. Pretty cool. But the thing that got my way-back machine working was spotting a very young and trim John Banner. Who?&nbsp;Ok...fair 'nuff. John, in later life, would hefty up and become the beloved Sgt. Schultz on &quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot;. Cool, right?<br /><br />Ok...so maybe I had too much time on my hands and not enough beer...but it's what I did to entertain myself last night. <br /><br />Anyhow...here it is...Saturday...a blustery, chill day in Sunny California. High of 61f and low of 38f. We had thunder during an afternoon storm. I didn't see any lightning though. We had a bout of hail too. The rain was fairly heavy for awhile...think:&nbsp;cow pissing on a flat rock. Yeah. <br /><br />I&nbsp;also watched Mixed Martial Arts. I'd never seen it before. Wow. Very cool. It's amazing what you get to watch when you have the house to yourself. I am reminded of the time, many years ago, when I first discovered Australian Rules Football at about the same time I&nbsp;found America's Cup Yacht racing....who knew?&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyhow....life is slow, here at the Casa. I&nbsp;guess that's the way it ought to be.

It's political silly-season too. That is to say campaign time for hopeful politicians. The former is to the latter in this:&nbsp;The average citizen's trust in the seasonal forecast ought to be the same as the expectation of promises of reform and honest government. (Parse it. It's in there somewhere).<br /><br />===========<br /><br />I've been driving through three of N. California's counties regularly, almost daily. These represent the bulk of the prime wine-grapes produced by the state (with a tip of the hat and a nod to Fresno). The fields are green and lush looking, considering the early date. Things are moving apace in these fields. Many undocumented tourists are to be seen there, busily consuming the welfare and other services that regular Americans won't consume (oops...I segued into politics again ...sorry). <br /><br />Speaking of which.....Arizona is getting slammed for enforcing Federal law. How does that work? California has a similar law on the books from the 80's. WTF?<br /><br />Anyhow....it's been cool and damp and it might be another bumper year for wine grapes. As the occasional consumer of wine, it's in my best interest to see that premium wine prices get depressed ...so that when I try to cure my own depression with wine, I can do it as cheaply as possible.

Or to put it more directly...mid month bill paying time. <br /><br />There has either been an increase in drama in my life or....a decrease in my tolerance for such. I'm torn between two equally possible choices on this one. <br /><br />It's the beginning of that terrible time of the year when school gets out and everyone flies to the corners of the earth...and I get left at home. Oh...sure....it's mostly out of choice, but still..for a family oriented guy, being alone contains large chunks of suckage in a green donkey dick sauce. And, of course, there is all the attendant extra fees and doo-dads that we haven't budgeted for and so it all comes to a lovely, large pulsing, putrescence spewing boil of love leaking, spirit crushing self inflicted pain. In the new one-size-fits all package. <br /><br />IN other news, it's been down in the low 30's overnight this past week, but has warmed up a good deal sneaking up on 80, so (I&nbsp;think) we're getting back into a seasonal norm. <br /><br />On reflection, somewhere in that mess above is a major hint of why I'm still here I&nbsp;guess. Funny how you hide crap like that from yourself and then, in an off hand way, drop it out for everyone else to see. Hmm. I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;better think it out again. <br /><br />Anyhow....so lately I&nbsp;spend a lot of time thinking about all your love lives as dwelling on mine just leads to madness...or disappointedness or something like that. <br /><br />Politics....it's how I get fucked without a ring.<br /><br />Politics 2...the Brits have just bought a lovely 5-year plan for constant entertainment. I'd be a Tory, if I were a Brit, but I&nbsp;thought that Clegg was an interesting character....I'd have been interested to listen to him, but I still think that lefties (of any stripe) are the cause and not the cure. I miss Paddy Ashdown. I&nbsp;think he was a remarkable fellow, a lovely speaker and still so wrong...but fun to have around. And nearly as good looking as I&nbsp;wish I&nbsp;was. (Know what I mean? Yeah...I thought so.)<br /><br />Politics 3....I going Libertarian, for the foreseeable future. I&nbsp;over looked Ron Paul as a nut-case last time and held my nose and voted for McCain almost entirely because of Palin. <br /><br />Just thought YOu'd like to know. <br /><br />I had a miserable movie week. I&nbsp;hereby declare that I&nbsp;shall never again knowing watch a Quentin Tarantino movie ever. I&nbsp;watched &quot;Inglorious Basterds&quot;&nbsp;all the way through and wondered...hunh? Asshole.&nbsp; I&nbsp;also watched the first 15 minutes, or so, of &quot;District 9&quot; ... before clawing my eyes out. Geez. At least I&nbsp;saved the $60 or so bucks that it would have cost in the theater ....so at least there is an up side. <br /><br />I'm halfway through season 5 of &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. It's great stuff. I highly recommend it along with &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;The Wire&quot;, &quot;Rome&quot;, &quot;Deadwood&quot;, &quot;The Shield&quot;...just to mention a few. If you have NetFlix, check 'em out. <br /><br />I saw &quot;A Rumor of Angels&quot; last night. Vanessa Redgrave. It's a small movie it got the job done, if you were looking to have your tear ducts exploited. I was in that mood, so it worked for me. It also was in agreement with my philosophy about so spiritual stuff so I overlooked a few of the flaws. Not a perfect movie, but it was a nice one. Just thought you'd like to know. <br /><br />Ok...I'll try to be more regular around here...try to get back to my old rhythm..no promises...but I'll try.<br /><br />G'bless all..<br /><br />Mr. Upton Ogood<br /><br /></span></span>"

Life threw me a curve-ball and I&nbsp;face-planted and cried like a bitch. <br /><br />I was talking to Felashe the other day...I was doing a blue-sky plan of what I was going to do with my $266 million lottery winnings (umm...I didn't win)...mostly it was a matter of sharing the wealth and traveling.&nbsp; When I started to wind down, she said something to the effect that it all sounded nice and she that she'd love to go too ..... If I wanted her to come with me. <br /><br />At least, now I&nbsp;know, she's aware of the crap that's floating around us. And that's pretty much where I'm at...although not entirely...it's complicated. But enough of that....<br /><br />&quot;In your letters, when you these unlucky deeds relate, speak of me as I am...nothing extenuate, nor set aught down in malice. ...Speak of one who loved not wisely but too well.....&quot;<br /><br />In other news:&nbsp;my local cheapie gas station is selling for $3.04.99/gal.. (That's up about .05) It has been cool and damp (lots of showers) here in sunny California. And the state is on the verge of financial collapse. I'm still plodding along with the last stages of the ebola-mutation that I came down with about a month ago. Other than that, life is good. <br /><br />Oh....FYI....I&nbsp;hear that the IMF&nbsp;will bail&nbsp; out Greece from their financial meltdown but that they require that Greece reform some of their social welfare programs. One of the first steps Greece is supposed to do:&nbsp;privatize health care.&nbsp; (Go ahead....work it out...I'll wait.)<br /><br />So...how's all that hope and change looking now?&nbsp;<br /><br />I&nbsp;have lots more...but I think I've tested your patience enough for now. Let me help you build up a tolerance for my rantishness. Know what I mean?&nbsp;Yeah...I knew that you did.<br /><br />Have a better day.<br /><br />Mr. Upton Ogood<br /><br /><br /><br /></span>"

It's cold, blustery and very wet. Maybe we've time traveled back to the 70's and we all fear Global Cooling. (Y'all are probably too young to remember any of that, but it was predicted, back then, that we'd be all dead by now 'cause plants would die and ice bergs would be in Bermuda.)<br /><br />Ah well....<br /><br />In other news....<br /><br />I&nbsp;had a bit of a health freak-out....couldn't get a hold of my M.D. to extend my blood pressure medication and I had run out. I&nbsp;could actually feel the pulse in my ears and neck. Spooky. I hadn't minded it at all prior to going on the medication, but having gotten in under control having it come back was spectacularly scary. Not to worry. He got it extended...I only missed a week or so. So, all's well that doesn't end in death. Know what I mean?&nbsp;<br /><br />Life continues to creep on in it's petty pace. It's classic.<br /><br />We're on season 4 of &quot;Rescue me&quot;&nbsp;and lovin' it. I can't recall the last time we watched a mailed-to-us movie. Everything has been &quot;instant&quot; lately. It's very cool. You have to check it out. I&nbsp;saw &quot;Princess of Mars&quot; the other night. It was a semi-terrible movie...except for this:&nbsp;It was the first time I'd ever seen a film on the Barsoom series (by E. R. Burroughs). It felt like a &quot;direct to video&quot;&nbsp;thing...but it was fairly well done and the effects weren't entirely cheesy. They gave it a fair shot. (Ok...Tracy Lords as the princess might have be a tip off that they weren't expecting block buster results...but still...they didn't phone it in). Anyhow...the point is:&nbsp;There is a ton of stuff out there that I'd never consider looking at were it not &quot;instantly&quot; available. I&nbsp;kinda like kissing frogs. I&nbsp;hope it speaks well of my character.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've been jones-ing for kink, but I've been pacified with vanilla. After a long stretch of nothing, vanilla is better than nuttin'. <br /><br />I&nbsp;have a post in mind, an idea lifted from Morningstar, that I'll be doing in a couple of days. Something to look forward to....or not.<br /><br />Until then, I'm ....<br /><br />Mr. Upton Ogood<br /><br /></span>"

Or maybe it's all those pro 4/20 demonstrations...but there is something in the air. Honest.<br /><br />So...here's the deal:&nbsp;In today's metro section of the San Francisco Chronicle I read that the city's softball team had been stripped of it's 2nd place showing in the Gay Softball World Series. It turns out that if you have a team in that league, you are allowed to have two straight players, maximum. An Atlanta team had protested San Francisco's 2nd place claiming that the team was too straight to be legal. Consequently three of team San Francisco players were subjected to what can only be called an inquisition by a 25 person panel delving into each man's sexual practices, preferences and fantasies. The subsequent decision:&nbsp;San Francisco's team was too straight. <br /><br />One of the players had asked, &quot;Can I say that I'm 'bi'?&quot;&nbsp;to which he received the official response, this isn't the Bi Softball League. <br /><br />Just goes to show....you have to know which team you're on before you can play the game ;-)<br /><br />Or <br /><br />You can't play for a team if you're not on that team...or sumpthin' like that. <br /><br />Speaking of dumb:&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't know why, but I've gotten into the habit of watching &quot;America's Biggest Loser&quot; (which is a shameful admission all by itself) and the terrible thing is this.....I can only watch if I'm eating dinner. It seems to give the show a sense of irony which it otherwise lacks. <br /><br />Well...it's a fair, although coolish, day here in Northern paradise. It's 10:10am and 53f. Not too bad for spring. <br /><br />I'm off to nap. Have a better day...'cause I'm <br /><br />Upton Ogood<br /><br /></span>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium;"">....then it must be time for one more disjointed mumble from Upton. <br /><br />Fair warning:&nbsp;I've been down with diptheria, malaria or B.S.E. or something since last Thursday. I&nbsp;spent all of yesterday unconscious, save for about 8 hours over two trips to the kitchen for coffee and other drugs. It's all very much like being on a bender without the pee breaks or bar nuts. Point is:&nbsp;I'm mentally <em>OFF</em> beyond which I&nbsp;can not describe. <br /><br />Yeah....so here I am, in sunny California, enjoying the quiet of an empty house and just now noticing that it's raining out. I&nbsp;have no idea how long that's been going on. I'm always the last to know. <br /><br />It isn't easy being sick. But being unaware of being sick does take the sting out. I was nearly totally unaware all of yesterday...so it was sorta like a surprise leap year or something. Although, come to think on it, doesn't leap year give you an extra day?&nbsp;Well...you know what I mean...or if you don't, I refer you to the &quot;Fair Warning&quot; thing. <br />Which reminds me of the dance they do during questions to the Prime Minister, when the PM says something like &quot;I&nbsp;refer the member to the response I made some moments ago&quot;. Free association:&nbsp;you get what you pay for. <br /><br />Speaking of which....Brit politics that is...they're having some fun over there these days...their Liberal Democrats seem to be echoing (at least on immigration) the public appeal that the Tea-party Patriots over here&nbsp; are. The fun, to my mind, is that the Lib-Dems seem to have bracketed the Conservatives by going to the right of them on immigration while holding the center on social programs (programmes to you non-American speakers).&nbsp; I mentioned this earlier to a fellow blogger-ette, which is why it's so fresh in mind. The other Brit party is the Labour party...fairly well left of center. IT was from that source that our very own Joe Biden went for source material for a speech he made back in 1988. Neal Kinnock was the Labour leader back then and gave a real tub-thumper of a speech. Joe liked it so well, he gave it himself....he just failed to mention that he lifted it, whole cloth, and also failed to mention Mr. Kinnock. <br /><br />Ah well....those were the days my friend....(hum along)....<br /><br />Speaking of days gone by.....I've been doing a whole lot of On-demand tv stuff. I'm on season 3 of &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. We did all of &quot;24&quot; and are now watching it live. It really is easier to watch a series all at once, or at least in large lumps/clumps than it is to have to crawl after it, consuming whatever pieces they deem to drop to you along the way. I've been doing a lot of Brit mystery stuff. Their &quot;Life on Mars&quot;&nbsp;was positively great. Ours was positively canceled. They don't do everything perfectly, though. I&nbsp;watched a couple of episodes of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; with Jonas Armstrong....it was unwatchable. All the time I viewed it I was thinking....this is how the Brits think American TV looks. <br /><br />Anyhow...the dust seems to have settled with Kaya...and I'm glad that things are still in the non-nuclear cloud stage. I&nbsp;can relate. <br /><br />I've been traveling a bit further these last several months:&nbsp;I'm now visiting three counties on a daily basis. Makes for a longer day for me, same money...but what the hell....better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. <br /><br />The vines are sprouting green and the undocumented economic tourists are back. So, I suppose things are getting back to normal. <br /><br />I&nbsp;don't think I mentioned:&nbsp;Mordred, that king killing kid, came through for Christmas. He bought me a &quot;big screen&quot;&nbsp;tv, something I've been putting off for a long time. Isn't that a kick?&nbsp;Of course &nbsp;I then had to go and get an HD-receiver for the Dish...an HD-disc player and sign-up for DISH&nbsp;for another locked in year. Still...it's the thought that counts. <br /><br />The eldest un-named is probably moving out of state.<br />Hercules is now a graduate of college and pursuing a career...and being pursued. <br />Mordred continues to worry me.<br />Queen is a 3.7+ gpa junior and is talking about science/math as a career.<br />Girly-girl is a 3.1 gpa freshman and has a music major in mind.<br /><br />All I&nbsp;want is to get Felashe alone, in New Hampshire and start living again. Finally. <br /><br />God bless us all, each and every one. <br /><br />Mr. Upton Ogood<br /><br /><br /><br /></span>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium;"">....is what I think of when I'm trying something new. <br /><br />You know how everbody's grannie is the world's greatest cook and how she never measures anything?&nbsp;It's like asymetric warfare in the kitchen with her....she just jumps in, grabs stuff ...bing, bang, boom....it's classic whatever and everyone loves it. <br /><br />So....I'm kicking around a rye-bread recipe....just throwin' things in and seeing what happens. My first shot got me a couple of very dense loaves...they didn't rise much but were very tasty....similar to Boston brown bread somewhat. This time I threw in a bit of baking soda and, bang!, it turned out pretty good. <br /><br />The jist of the recipe is this:<br /><br />Cold coffee<br />Rye flour<br />A/P flour<br />crisco<br />molasses<br />salt<br />caraway seeds<br />poppy seeds<br />a bit of water for the yeast<br />and yeast<br /><br />In my mind, it seemed like these would be the things that grandma would have had to hand and thrown in to knock out a couple of loaves. (Maybe if she were middle European, two hundred years ago, she might have used beet juice from boiling beets for her liquid as well as a sweetner...but I'm just speculating)<br /><br />Whaddayamean?&nbsp;Oh....yeah...I suppose it is a little off the wall as a topic. To be honest, there is so much going on in the blog-o-verse that is close to home, as it were, that talking about it might be uncomfy for some others. Aslo, it might be uncomfy for me....and that seems to count for the most. <br /><br />Let me put it this way....<br /><br />Y'all recall that story about me being visited by aliens and taken away?&nbsp;Well....it wasn't entirely true. Yeah. I&nbsp;know. You're shocked. The truth of the matter is/was that I didn't want to tell the entire truth about what was going on here in the casa because, 1) way too much drama for a drama free zone and, 2) since Felashe occasionally reads this stuff, I didn't want to &quot;say&quot; too much that might be hurtful or generate resentment. So... I was in a box (much like the story's end) and no obvious way out. <br /><br />Now...that I'm back...things are in an equilibrium state of indeterminate feelings. It can all go entirely egg shaped at any minute or the clouds could part and angels drop down singing four part harmony to rival the Mamas and Papas (although just barely). <br /><br />And, of course, just as I'm kicking the door open to come back into the world....other worlds are turning to shite. <br /><br />This is not a happy thing. &lt;major duh&gt;<br /><br />It's an interesting thing, if you don't mind the impersonal touch, that relationships break up in the spring and set up in the fall. This observation comes from (no surprise) a book a read some time ago. It's a nesting thing. For both genders. It's observed that a &quot;young man's fancy&quot;&nbsp;gets prodded awake in the spring. Well, trust me, old men get prodded by the spring as well. I&nbsp;suspect then that men, in general, get that form of wanderlust every spring and all of 'em look to hole-up in the fall. Ladies....same for y'all, I betcha. <br /><br />There is also another observation on relationships:&nbsp;if you have a crowd of pals and one of the couples in the crowd breaks up, chances are there are going to be others breaking up as well. I've seen it before....over and over. It's a tribal thing, I think. Or maybe &quot;herd&quot;. <br /><br />Anyway....on a personal note....this last:&nbsp;It's amazing that as much as I love my wife and my kids that I can resent them both for intruding on my relationship with them separately. I&nbsp; know it's dumb...but just because it's dumb doesn't mean it isn't real. Y'all with me on this?&nbsp;No?&nbsp;Too foreign a thought?&nbsp;Too small minded?&nbsp;<br /><br />Crap...just one more person who doesn't understand me. <br /><br />Ah well...it's a big hill. Don't let gravity grab ya. <br /><br />Upton<br /><br /></span>"

I&nbsp;dunno what I expected, but I probably would have been more comfy with structure of a sort. Still, there was a general satisfaction in knowing that, if I didn't shout it, my -VOICE- would not be heard...so I did my fair share of shouting. Ok...truth telling:&nbsp;No actual shouting happened. It was actually pretty tame. Everyone was very polite and attentive. My point is this:&nbsp;There is no -PRIMARY- political POV at these things, save that things must change and that politicians need to be more responsive to constituents. The one thing that is consistent with attendees:&nbsp;Dissatisfaction. <br /><br />These are folks, like me, who have considered politics to be a spectator sport. We've never been active. We've had better things to do. Now we recognize that things won't change unless we take action. We just don't know how to do that quite yet, but we're gonna figure it out...raise hell and get it done.&nbsp;<br /><br />At least that is the way I saw it. YMMV. Go to one of these meets. Check it out. Sign up or shine it on, as you like. <br /><br />In other news about dissatisfaction:&nbsp;I haven't gotten back to my blog slog. This isn't a happy claim. It just is. But, I do visit several sites that I've been into for years and couldn't not visit. One of 'em has me up as a link. As a vanilla blog. That is a not happy thing. It's probably accurate, but I am not amused. It wasn't where I had intended on going with this thing. <br /><br />Once upon a time, I thought I'd sit down and write about what it's like being older, kinky and the reality of having kids. I thought I'd write about what things are like when you have to be a whole lot quieter 'cause the kids are probably still awake. Y'all know what I mean.&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean to say that when you're trying to do some things and you don't want those things to spill outside of the box that needs to contain your personal reality. The things we do are for us. We don't want to involve or affect anyone else. That kind of balance. <br /><br />I&nbsp;guess my recent at-home-drama-fest has been a long time in the making since so little of this blog has had to do with sex or kink. Mea culpa, to some extent. <br /><br /></span><p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">So...if you've linked me, thank you. If you've pegged me as vanilla....fair dinkum. Just know, </span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>&quot;.....it's not the way I&nbsp;want it to be...&quot;</em><br /><br />Ah well...<br /><br />IN other news:&nbsp;My cheapest gas is $2.97 (stuff in Napa is 3:17 for the cheap stuff).&nbsp; Spring is in the air here, with temps in the low 60's (11am and it's 58f). It's been a fairly wet winter so no drought (possibly). <br /><br />But speaking of drought...many communities have had conservation programs in place. Some of them work. Now comes the fun part. Because water consumption is down, some water districts claim they have to raise rates so that they can make up the shortfall of revenue. How's that for stupid. Compel you to use less water and then, when you do, make you pay more for the it because you a good stupid citizen. <br /><br />I'm reading a book by a guy named Suarez...it's the second in a series (yeah...I know...he's still alive...ok...it's a gamble). His first was <em>Daemon</em>. A&nbsp;pretty good hi-tech of near future mayhem. A sort of who-done-it but with twists. This one is <em>Freedom</em> (with 'tm' as superscript). It follows on the same story line. I'm liking it and only mention it because at least this guy seems interested in writing. <br /><br />That's all I've got for you....<br /><br />Later<br /><br />Upton<br /><br /></span></p>"

It just dindn't seem to fit. <br /><br />Sure....Fra was an Irish sprite (sort of) and, being Irish, seemed to always be in favor of whatever was least popular. That would account for his being a Barry-buddy. But as an Irish-imp he'd also always have a streak of liberty-loving independance (of a contratrian nature) and that didn't square with any of this. <br /><br />I'm missing something here. <br /><br />So I&nbsp;slipped into something more comfortable: My agent-provacatuer </span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">pose. I said &quot;Capitalism is the system where a man does work, things happen and he gets paid. Socialism is a system where a man does work, nothing really happens and everyone gets paid&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;Yeah! You got it...so what's the problem?&quot;,&nbsp; Barry responded. <br /><br />Gotcha! I&nbsp;knew it. This isn't &quot;Barry&quot;. He would never openly admit to that. So who is he? What does he want?&nbsp;How the hell do I&nbsp;get him out of my kitchen??&nbsp;And what to do about Fra?<br /><br />Fra!&nbsp;I&nbsp;turned to my pal and, as nonchalantly as I could, I&nbsp;asked him for a Cuban. Zoom and he's handing me a cigar. Aha!! Fra -should- have known that I was asking for a sandwich, so now I&nbsp;knew they are both imposters.&nbsp;<br /><br />Think, Upton. THink!!<br /><br />Being fleet of thought and even quicker of wit, I&nbsp;summed up my options (nil), and decided to .....<br /><br />Give the fuck up.<br /><br />&quot;Ok guys&quot;, I&nbsp;said. &quot;I know you're both frauds. Imposters. I&nbsp;don't know who you are or what you want, but you can have another beer a couple of spare smokes and then you have to be on your way....or there WILL&nbsp;be a scene.&quot;&nbsp;(I&nbsp;hoped this sounded menacing and not nearly as gay as it sounded to my own ear).<br /><br />The creatures looked at each other as though communicating and then each began to shimmer.....as did the walls and ....oh my...my kitchen pitched a bit and the floor seemed to roll. WTF? <br /><br />The creatures....aha....yeah....Barry is a grey. One of those long limbed aliens as I first thought.....and Fra...one of the blues...sort of squat and thick and ogre-ish.

I'm on a ship. Ok..lemme just look about a bit. I&nbsp;didn't see any portholes or doors but I&nbsp;knew I was on a ship. I&nbsp;stepped back a bit and felt a walll at my back. No escape here...but then the wall <em>gave</em>. I&nbsp;leaned into it and, POP, slid through. <br /><br />Suddenly there was pounding on the wall. They couldn't get in. I looked around. It was a very large bathroom. On a ship. A ship's bathroom. There were no doors. No windows. No way in. BUt that also meant...no way out. I&nbsp;investigated this huge space and found many books and a refrigerator. A hot plate and shelves with lots of canned goods and, very important, coffee and cigs. Wow. As though it were meant for me! ANd, somehow, maybe it was. <br /><br />I&nbsp;settled in.<br /><br />After a long while, the banging stopped. THey had gone away. I still couldn't find a way out but it didn't seem that important. I&nbsp;had all I&nbsp;needed....me in my ship's toilet. <br /><br />And so....that is where I have been....trapped in my very own head....all this time. <br /><br />All because of an alien shit-weasel...but there is still a shaggy-dog story to be told of Fra...and that is quite a tail to tell.<br /><br />But I&nbsp;am back now...and yeah...I&nbsp;did cause a scene, but it was from Othello....(<em>but no more of that..in your letters when you these unlucky deeds relate...speak of me as I&nbsp;am...nothing extenuate...nor set aught down in malice</em>)<br /><br />I&nbsp;-was- on a roll but now there's nothing left but poppy seeds. <br /><br />Until next time.....<br /><br />Mr. Upton Ogood<br /><br /></span>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium;"">In hindsight, it was all terribly funny, but at that exact moment I was filled with nameless dread. <br /><br />Here I was, having hastily covered my impressive but otherwise inappropriate nakedness, sitting on my bed having a smoke with either the leader of the free world or an alien lifeform in the guise of the president. (I&nbsp;was still holding out hope for that free pass to the universe).<br /><br />It struck me as odd, too, the faint flickery light that seemed to bathe his face occasionally. Then I noticed the tele-promp-ter that seemed to follow him wherever he went like a C3PO or something. <br /><br />Taking the opportunity to brace a political foe, I had of course posed several questions concerning his (if it was him) stances on national and foreign affairs. Like a pro, he dodged each and every one, verbally dancing rings around me. I&nbsp;told him that I'd grown up in the land of Kennedy's and was used to political double-speak and I urged him to speak directly for a change. This seems to have caught him off balance for he immediately said, &quot;Well...Uncle Teddy always said that...uh...aw fuck!&quot;, then looked to the tele-promp-ter</span>. <span style=""font-size: medium;"">I&nbsp;looked too.<br /><br />The machine had &quot;Ooops&quot; flashing on it's screen. I guess in political speak, oops=aw fuck. This is good to know. <br /><br />At this point he attempted to swear me to secrecy (which I tap danced away from) and proceeded to explain. He, he declared, was actually the love-child of Eunice Kennedy and a stranded Nigerian diplomat. They had met via a newspaper ad in which the diplomat had pleaded for assistance in freeing up a very large sum of money held hostage, which he could only free if he had an American bank account with a nominal opening sum deposited. They had met, fell in love, exchanged checks and passed from each other's lives.....she having acquired a swelling belly, a rubber check and a story that still lives on today. </span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br /><br />Anyhow...he really was born in Hawaii, but because of his parentage, his actual birth certificate could never be published...at least during my life time. <br /><br />Uncle Teddy, and the rest of the family, had overseen his education and, considering their (the Kennedy's) antipathy to all things Clinton, is was no surprise that they supported Barry's future political </span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">career. I'm sure that they feel like the White House to be family property....but that's just me. <br /><br />They more he spoke the more excited he became. I&nbsp;tried to calm him and offered to take him out to the kitchen for a beer. This did the trick. &quot;Lead on!&quot; quoth he. <br /><br />We settled into the chairs and opened our beers. Following my lead, we slammed the brews down and, voila, who should appear with replacements but my very own Fra Ogood, the famous pooka St. Bernard. <br /><br />Barry reached for the beers and muttered a &quot;thanks&quot; and my eyes flew open while my jaw responded to gravity and dropped. <br /><br />&quot;You can see him?&quot;, I asked.<br /><br />&quot;Of course...can't you?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well...yeah...I can see him...he's my pal&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;Cool...he's my ride&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;You rode him here?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Nah...he just sorta magics me around. I&nbsp;dunno how he does it, but however he does, it's always some place where I can get Oppies and beer&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;Oppies?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yeah...you know....O-Ps....Other peoples cigs...you know...bummed tobacco. The Mrs doesn't let me smoke my own, but I figure if I&nbsp;borrow or beg 'em, then it's cool&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh. Like health care. Yeah...I can see that, coming from you. That makes a kind of consistent sense&quot;, I&nbsp;said as I eyed Fra like the traitorous prick that he seemed to be. There goes my Universal euro-pass to the universe. Fuck.<br /><br />---------<br /><br />To be concluded, I think, next time. </span>"

"event","That, of course, is always the question when you've got a bit of a saga to relate. And then too, there is the whole &quot;which version to tell&quot; thing. It's quite a problem, as I am sure you are aware. 

Well...version 2:

It was a dark and rainy night. 

I&nbsp;had tucked myself into bed beside the comatose companion of my life and was just drifting off when, suddenly, I felt that odd, sixth-sense of someone else present. I&nbsp;had heard no noise of footsteps approaching or any other telltale hints of anyone else stirring in the casa. I&nbsp;pried my eyes open and glanced around, not really expecting to see anything in the brooding blackness of my bedroom. 

Nothing. or rather...maybe...something. A movement? I&nbsp;sprang upright, &quot;who's there?&quot; I thought I shouted. No response. Ok...so I spooked myself. No biggie. A layer less of pride, but otherwise no harm.

I&nbsp;settled back, prepared to drift off again but then, just as I was about to close my eyes I&nbsp;saw, or at least sensed movement. I&nbsp;ran through several scenes of me fighting off intruders, cape fluttering in my leaping about.....(yeah, right. like that was gonna happen)...and decided to stay vigilant to what might be going on. 

Slowly, a figure seemed to be approaching my side of the bed. It was an odd looking figure. My mind eventually formed the impression of a too tall, too loose-jointed a body for it to be entirely human. All the Whitley Strieber stories I&nbsp;ever read flooded my mind. (Ok...when I&nbsp;first saw &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, at the very end I&nbsp;said, out loud, &quot;I&nbsp;wanna go too&quot;). This is very cool. I'm being visited by one of those &quot;greys&quot;. Maybe, if I can avoid the whole anal-probe thing and get right to the galaxy-tourist thing I'd be in good shape. I figured my best approach to this whole thing of joining up for my very own star-trek thing would be to maintain calm and cool and so on. Impress him/her/it with my couth and culture and calm. So...

I&nbsp;leaped out of bed and screamed, &quot;Dude!&nbsp;You scared the crap outta me. Why didn't you let me know you were coming or something?&quot;&nbsp;(Yeah... couth in action).

The figure was frozen. Maybe I scared it too. But then the head seemed to turn in my direction, to the sound, seemingly, of my voice. Uh-oh. The head had ears. That wasn't reported by good old Whit in any of his tales. What have I stepped into? I rapidly was redrawing my plans for the immediate future. Then, the figure stepped a bit closer and, fuck me, in a wee beam of moonlight I&nbsp;saw that Mr. grey was really Mr. brown. 

Brown?&nbsp;I've heard of blue folks for Streiber, but brown?&nbsp;Man...Whiley needs to update his catalog. Or maybe I'm meeting the real-deal and old Whit has just been shuckin' and jivin' all this time. How cool would that be?&nbsp;Ok....plan c.

&quot;Sorry dude. You ok?&nbsp;Siddown and take a load off, ok&quot; came pouring from my face. Still not a sound, although the creature did sit down on the end of the bed. It's head drooped or dropped or something as though it was tired or shy. Or looking at the floor?&nbsp;I looked down. I didn't see anything on the floor. Just my feet, dropped clothes...his wingtips. 

WTF?&nbsp;Wingtips?&nbsp;What kind of martian wears wingtips?&nbsp;Not even illegal aliens wear wingtips. I braced myself to brace him when...

&quot;Um...yer nekkid&quot;,it said.&nbsp; I&nbsp;looked down and confirmed the diagnosis. 

&quot;Yeah. Sorry. Don't mean to show off, but you caught me....ah....with my pants down&quot;&nbsp;

&quot;...........&quot; 

Clearly this guy had no sense of humor. So, I&nbsp;pressed on with, &quot;....goes to show, it's not entirely true what they say about Irish guys&quot;&nbsp;and smiled. Still no response. Maybe he hasn't heard that short-dick slander about the Irish. 

Anyhow, to ease his discomfort I&nbsp;dug around on the floor for my pajama bottoms (they're there in case of fire or whatever). As I&nbsp;turned and bent to retrieve them, 

&quot;Oh, jeez!&quot;&nbsp;the creature growned. 

&quot;OOPS. Sorry, man. Full moon came out.&quot;&nbsp;I&nbsp;couldn't apologize quick enough. I&nbsp;didn't want to screw up my Universal Universe pass. 

I slipped on the pants and settled back onto the bed and, as quietly and reassuringly as I could, I&nbsp;said. &quot;Hi&quot;. and then, &quot;Welcome to California&quot;.&nbsp; Finally to fill the conversational void that was growing I said, &quot;What can I do for you?&nbsp;&quot;

&quot;Got a smoke I could bum?&quot; 

&quot;Uh...sure&quot;, says I, quick as a whip and showcasing my rapid thought process. &quot;...Lemme just turn up the light and I'll find 'em. They're right here, somewhere, on my night table&quot;. 

I turned and&nbsp; reached up to my headboard where there is a rheostat that controls the overhead lights. Slightly turning the knob, the lamps began to offer some dull orange-y light. As I&nbsp;turned back, I&nbsp;found my pack of Marlboros and lighter and completed my rotation offering up the pack to my visitor. As I did, his features and form came into focus. I was stunned. Shocked. 

&quot;Obama?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. But you can call me Barry&quot;, says he. 

&quot;Coo. Thanks. I've hated to call you Mr President&quot; quipped I, but he didn't seem to get the joke. &quot;Here. Have one&quot;&nbsp;and I&nbsp;passed the pack. 

He greedily grabbed the pack, popped one out and had the lighter kissing the tube in a flash. A deep inhale, followed by a great &quot;Ahhhhhhh&quot;&nbsp;.

I&nbsp;don't think I'm going to Omnicron-3 or Tau-ceti anytime soon. Shit.

&lt;to be continued, if your &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; is not too strained&gt;

"event","This Valentine's Day was the absolute BEST Valentine's Day EVER! As everyone knows, me and my bf have been having alotta problems recently w/ trust issues and juss stupid fights over ridiculous things. Well, yesterday he really made up for it. I was upset b/c I worked from 10-3 and I didnt get a call from him besides the call at midnight wishing me a happy valentine's day and a happy anniversary. (yesterday was also our 11 month anniversary) Well he surprised me and showed up at my house around 3:30. He bought me the most beautiful roses I have ever seen (peach w/ pink on top). He also spent an hour and a half cooking me dinner (flounder and shrimp). We had a candlelight dinner and then he had candy hearts leading up to the bathroom where he had a bubble bath w/ rose pedals waiting for me. ;) You can guess what happened after that, no need for detail...lol Overall, it was prolly one of the best days of our entire 11 month relationship. We talked and basically patched things up between us and settled all the little problems in our relationship. We're now working on getting along better and juss enjoying being happy with each other. I hope everyone had as great a Valentine's Day as I did! I gotta go eat dinner then work on a history report! Cya! <33 :)"

"event","This past week has been really rough on me. As most of you know, my good friend and ex-boyfriend passed away on Saturday, Jan. 10, 2004. He was my first love and I was his. We were together for a year and had COUNTLESS memories together. After a week of grieving over him and visiting him while on life support in the hospital, I have finally found my peace with his passing away. 

I bought myself a cross necklace with my birthstone in it and I also bought Bill the same necklace with his birthstone in it. I put it in a bag along with a note and a sympathy card, and I left it on the porch at his house for his mom to receive. 

Today, I attended Bill's viewing from 2-4. Bill looked absolutely gorgeous. They dressed him in a red South Pole sweater and jeans. He wouldn't have wanted to wear a suit, everyone knows that. 

But, the BEST part was that the necklace I had bought him was enclosed in his folded hands. =*[

His mother broke out into tears at the sight of me entering. She endlessly thanked me for the necklace and praised my thoughtful gesture. She said it made her day and she was so happy and actually smiled. She also ended with ""He loved you so much."" His sister also told me the same thing, ""He loved you."" 

Because of this, I feel soo good about what I had done. It feels so good to know that even in this time of grief, I brought a smile to his mother's face, even for a brief second. Bill has something from me to carry on with him in heaven. In this, I have found my inner peace. <'33"

<P><FONT color=#ff0000>REST IN PEACE WILLIAM (BILL) MICHAEL MEDEIROS &lt;'33</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000><'33 An Angel Born on March 22, 1983 <'33</FONT></P>

<P>Bill truly was an angel within his short time here on Earth. He brought life and laughter to his friends and family. He had a huge heart and cared so deeply for the people in his life. He was a great friend and was so fun to be with. He had many friends and a large family who he loved and cared about dearly. Sadly, a few of these friends were not as true to him as he thought and got him involved in things which tragically lead to his death. If a certain individual would've used his brain and heart in making a quick decision, a lot of pain and heartache could've been prevented. Sadly, Bill did make a&nbsp;deadly choice, but another individual made an even&nbsp;deadlier choice. Now, his family and friends are left here on Earth to grieve over this angel. We have only the memory of his gorgeous face and bright smile looking down upon us. Everyone wishes that fate did not take this turn, but unfortunately it did. No one and nothing can bring him back. It's sad and heartbreaking. We must cherish the time he was with us and the memories we do have with him. He truly is an angel and will remain in our hearts and prayers forever, until our dying day.&nbsp;He's in heaven now among other angels and God is looking after&nbsp;him now. GOD BLESS YOU Bill. You are sadly missed by all. &lt;'33</P>"

I dont even really shower at myy own house anymore. As I'm sure you've heard, my rents went away on vaykay to Fl. fer a week 'n whaa does crazy me decide to do? Yeaaa, u can guess...I decided to have a ""small get together"" 'n invite a few friends over. Well...5 bottles of liquor and 7 cases of beer later, 31 ppl ended up at myy house. I guess I have more friends than I thought, and atleast 90% of us were underage. To sum it up, 15 cop cars lined up myy street 'n we were taken to tha police station 'n luckily given disorderly conduct 'n a $300 fine instead of underage drinking. That's a reliefe considering it woulda been put on myy record 'n myy driving privileges woulda been taken away. Luckily, we got off w/ that tho. Even luckier, I'm gettin' outta myy fine. I got connections 'n Im good liek that. ;) Anyways, tha bad news is sum1 decided to steal ALL myy cds...myy whole case of about 200 cds.

"event","*i gave u chances on top of chances, opportunities taken fer granted. myy reality is all ur exshalities cause insanity; y u askin'me? took myy kindness fer sign of weakness, myy own blindness cause myy sadness
no longer am a slave over ur madness, i am glad it*s finally over*

^^ up until this morning, i felt this way 'bout a -certain sum1- but now tha mood's changed...

*it*s been tooh long & i*m lost w/o u, what am i gunna do? said i been needin' u, wantin' u; wonderin' if ur tha same and who*s been w/ u. is ur heart still mine? i wanna cry sometimes, i miss u* <33

who ever said love is perfect? y is it that tha ones we love always seem to hurt us tha most? when someone figures this out, pleez lemme kno.

well, i finally realized that myy ex *did not* cheat on me, but he DID sleep in tha same bed w/ another gurrl, which by tha way hurts juss as much. =o( i <33 him more than anything in this world, it*s hard. who knows if things will ever b tha same? we*re tryin' tho. anywaysss......

onto myy day so far...i had a bio lab @ 8am this morning, which sucked. we weighed m&ms, (even tho i ate half of'em..hehe)how pointless is that?!? i guess it*s supposta serve sum kinda educational purpose. i got outta class @ 9:50 n stopped at kelly's apt. to see him<3 since i missed him tons!! we were goin' thru withdrawal fer awhile. i came in2 work @ 11am n gotta sit here on myy ass bored as hell till 'bout 12:30. then i can go home n take a nap fer an hr. then i*m hittin' up tha gym fer a *much* needed workout. workin' out makes me feel soo much better 'bout myself...i*m gettin' abs tooh! im psyched! ima b ridiculously toned by tha spring! ;) later tonite, i might hitt up evolution w/ myy boy cuz i havent been there in liek 2 weeks! i need to get myy groove on! =) *peace* <3 xoxo

"event","i honestly think today was the -longest- day of myy life! first off, i have class @ 8am, which is overwhelming considering it takes me a half hr. juss to get to school; myy classes were pretty much boring...tha only motivation i have to get myy lazy ass to class on time is tha hottie i sit next to in myy college algebra class! ;) hehe..theres tooh many hott guys @ lccc ...its unreal*! im determined 'n have made it a personal goal fer myself to find a hott/sweet guy in school! i*ll keep ya posted on myy success rate. 

im finally single after myy ex cheated on me. (his loss by tha way!) i loved him alot, but it gives me room to grow as a person 'n it only made me 10x stronger. i*m not takin' anymore sh!t from guys from now on. =) 

i worked 4-9 tonite 'n basically juss came home 'n relaxed. i took a niice hot bath 'n listened to myy ashanti cd; i <33 her, she always relieves myy stress after a long, hard day of school/work. it*s 11:35pm now 'n i finally got to create myy own journal! (after a ridiculous longg process of tryin' to find someone w/ a password i can use!) im off to bed within an hr. er so, but i juss wanted to make myy very first entry! =) keep checkin' bak cuz i*ll b writing in this several times a day, whenever i get a chance to come online. *sweet dreams* nite nite <3  

(( my quote * eventually, tha one thing u loved that fell apart will someday find its way bak together again ))"

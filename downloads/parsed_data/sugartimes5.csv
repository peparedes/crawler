always on the defense, because if it's not me, it's her, like today when she was in the pool, she was pulling herself up and out of the water and she was like ""i'm doing pull ups."" and then she looked really scared. and very quickly she was like, ""but i don't wear them anymore. so don't say that.""
liz is 14.
it's funny, and it makes sense, i guess, that she is the first person to stick up for me if i look more hurt than they think i should.

i have talked to like 4 girls this week about wanting to have sex all the time. why are guys allowed to be so open about their horniness and sexcapades but we are supposed to be coy and quiet and pretend like we feel slutty if we sleep with a bunch of different guys and not just one? or none at all? STDS and all that are...well,  uncool, and i'm not ""down"" with that. pregnancy, too, no thanks. but everything else, i mean, am i supposed to think i have a problem if i want to be doing it all the time????? these girls that i talked to, they ain't married or some shit. i just don't think it's fair that the double standard has made it's way into the year 2009. i ain't talkin erection sans protection, but i just wanna fuck, man. i'm tired of this bullshit. i hate men, otherwise i'd become a prostitute. only until i got my nursing degree. then i'd like my job until i had another job i'm assuming i'll like too. my first reaction to prostitution is ""how degrading! how desperate!"" but then i think of men who call these numbers and pay a lot of money for some strange girl to come have sex with them. or rape unwilling ones. little ones. and i think...maybe the girl isn't the pathetic one.
same with stripping. seriously? that amount of money thrown at you not because you're (necessarily) smart, pretty, have done anything productive, will do anything productive etc etc etc---- just for having a female physique?
i mean, it ""sucks dick"" that that's where our power predominantly lies....but, until another day.

there are at least three million things that are worse than the broken belt and the reason it broke in the first place. at least three million. but when things aren't being processed and the belt is still going at the same speed with the same amount of objects, you're on the verge of tears every single time you talk about something that isn't a food on the menu. literally, ON the menu. not a rhetorical ""menu of life"" but you are going to cry if you say something other than ""medium well"" or "" a salad."" you've always been an emotional person but this is embarrassing and people think you're crying because of a glitch in the conveyor belt. 
but you're not. my doctor says this is the reason all these people have trail mix and nooks and crannies and knots under their skin in their faces in my dreams and that's why there are living bugs under my own skin. it gets better but really because of the scitzophrenic medicine i have to take before bed. i don't want to trick myself with sedatives; i want these things to be gone.
when you tell me that i'm not dead and that no one has died and so i need to be quiet and move on, i kind of know what you mean except i don't know exactly what you want me to ""move on"" from, but more so, i want you to fuck yourself and see the girl with the rods and cones under the first layer of her skin on her face and get a rash because of the bugs under your own. and then get an MRI and a radioactive shot and go into a metal tube that X rays your head. but mostly, fuck yourself.

in the real world, ""curvy"" is not like beyonce. 
if you want someone to take you seriously and your boobs are double D, you better damn well know your shit. and look good for the interview but not TOO good. 
we get very confused. like, when we say that giving birth is the most beautiful thing in the world, and that abortion should be done with, we are imagining a world where i can actually take care of a baby and still get a good degree in order to raise it properly and continue to raise it properly. or, in the event where i give it up for adoption, angelina jolie and brad pitt are the adopting parents. what is up with angelina jolie being the absolute norm? 
at bobs, an extra large in juniors clothing often times did not fit around the old chest/ hips/ top half of me. i'm not trying to say that i am a petite petunia, but if i am an extra-extra large, where does that leave _______ ? a mother shopping with her normal-sized daughter came to me worn down and sad. ""she can't fit into any of the clothes."" she said quietly as to not upset her daughter. ""nothing fits. she's not a little girl, but this is so discouraging."" 
i was never a small gal until eighth grade when i didn't eat for a few months after people said mean, mean things.  the world is such a cruel place for human girls. why is it that girls at their most unhealthy, most malnourished and in the deepest pain will get the most compliments on their appearance?

the sky is a light, light grey, no breaks in it, and the trees are entirely yellow. it is lemon world outside. there were sirens earlier, like tornado ones, erin came back home and we stayed in bed for a while. missed laz. pet jack.
the house: is: a WRECK. erin cleared off the table but only because someone spilled nail polish remover and the cat was licking it. then dry heaved.

i have been having trouble deciding if i would rather be with ace ventura or the masked V from V for vendetta. they are both entirely in different directions, which makes the decision very difficult. 
i feel new orleans seeping out from the bottom of my feet. there are some knife wounds that will not heal, and friends that i will miss everyday, but i do not long for the green and humidity and pouring alcohol from the skies like i once did. just like a break up, or a death, or anything, really, you just have to sit it out and let time do it's work. which is so hard, because you cannot make time do anything except go at it's normal rate.
sometimes i feel like i have curves in all the wrong places.

we had the bitchiest waitress last night. the one thing you really need to be, when you are a server, is friendly. if you fuck up the order, and are slow, or busy, or don't know the menu, whatever. but at least be a nice person and not a BITCH. 
my littlest cousin is smarter than i am. he told us, in his three-year old terms, how the voting system works, after laz, erin and i could not seem to figure it out. 
my aunt went on a three month trip to europe, and my uncle chris said that when he looked at his cat, he got sad because it made him think of her. he said that everything reminds him of her. she had been gone only a few hours. i told him to work on some art. he said that he was going to fix the things in his house that drive aunt angie crazy, because then she would come back and know that he loved her.

anywho, good luck to all yall evacuees. for some reason, i am so jealous. the hurricane class has some problems starting and finishing college it looks like. i am happy to see they've made it a bit cleaner as far as leaving the city goes. well, i wish you the best, you crescent asshole city.  i've got you branded on my ribs, right near my heart. it's, ironically enough, what they used to brand criminals with. at some glorious point. 
that's not really ironic i just wish someone had mentioned that beforehand.

"event","because i have done X and X i am therefore NOT innocent. but it does not make me guilty, either. because you have sex are you guilty? does someone have to fuck a certain number of people to be ""guilty"" or is it just after one, you are no longer innocent? or can you fuck X many people before you cannot be considered innocent? 
if i steal one can of soda am i all of a sudden bad?
or would i be GOOD because i didn't steal two?
but really, it's just soda, and it's just sex, and i don't believe that either will dictate whether or not you are ""innocent"" ""guilty"" ""good"" or ""bad."" however, in this society, it comes down to it. 
we really want people to be either or. i won't ever be either or. who will?????????????????????????????? i do not know a single one person that is either/ or ANYTHING. 
just because i want to say it:
i never wanted anyone to be ""guilty."" i never said YOU WERE BAD. i don't know one lick of a thing about you.
what i know is what i know---X and Z. I want to know Y. that's all. from X to Z ...Y looks Red. and Then i look blue. and i'm sure we will look brighter and brighter only as time goes on.
but really, there are so many more colors................ i never wanted you to be SOMETHING. i just wanted to know...what happened. i don't think you are innocent (but i don't know much). As far as being guilty? you are 100,000,000 other things too, i'm sure, and guilty might be one of them. do i know it? no. 
but it could have been SO MUCH EASIER TO GAGE ELEVEN MONTHS AGO IF YOU JUST SAID SOMETHING. 
i will, most definitely, get back to you.
peace."

"event","i was at the dock alone, damp in a clingy black and white wrap dress that i had swam in, felt like drew barrymore in ever after when i had been in the water (which was so effing cool) and then...though, i began to stare and things that were things, and think thoughts that i wish i could blow out of my nose and them be things, which i could throw on the cement like i did with the eggs once, ---like thoughts of being inadequate---a nubbly object, lonliness---a white round object, and red hot incredulousness------black SNOT.  the staring turned into drinking some shitty beer, and then a turtle came to the surface, bobbed it's little head a few times out of water, took a few looks at land----the land we dominate, and quickly, with a feeling of being SURE, dove back under the water, bettering him/herself forever more.
but THEN.......... there were two thin, thin wispy strings holding a white bobble in the middle, and the spider (eNORmous) was making more strings to hold it up. it wasn't a bug he was going to eat it was just the middle of his potential web. From that starting point he did five or so strings to the canoe and the dock, one on a low branch, and then began to tie it up by going from these parallel strings with perpendicular ones, like you know, like a SPIDEY web. i had just never watched him before. it was this mathematical art and he did it with such precision and speed. for the love of God, i could not believe the spider, he didn't even try and it was this magnificent web you see sprinkled with dew in calendars.   
so then i began to make spider silk in my OWN ass, and i have begun to draw the parallel strings from the ceiling and tables, whatever is there: then i will go from side to side, zig zagging, until i have caught what needs to be caught.
then, i imagine, just as the canoe had taken off hours later by someone else, the web will have disappeared but it will be no one's fault. if you cannot see the spider silk, some that is so strong people fish with it, it has nothing to do with your own eyes. if we were born with optical microscopes....well, woof: a surprise party would be hard to plan."

aunti min gave me a bunch of winter clothes. i actually almost started to cry. i got rid of a lot of wintery clothes when i went south. i like the idea of them being back instead of the assbusting clothes that i had to wear all yr round in the torrid heat and humidity. i looked so flab master all the time. long sleeves are WAY MORE my thang. 
i played tennis yesterday, turns out i have quite a flair for the sport. i know that my body looks like that of an olympian athlete but now i know i really am one. i am probably going to take it up for a career. 
i'm definitely going to either do that or make up the premise for new TV shows. like the simple life where two really rich girls get everyday normal jobs. or maybe super sweet 16 where i saw someone get a zorse(combo of zebra and horse.) she pet him and then it got escorted out. maybe i will do brook hogan knows best and find a really feminine girl to know things best.
probably i will play tennis too.

the more i give myself away to people who appreciate it, and i lose it from myself, i feel 100 times better. it was me time for way too ...toooo long. 
in that sense i am not so angry about the turn of events in the past ..year. because i would have kept trying to fit my ""writing career"" into some sort of a life but i would have been so miserable. because i didn't want to be a publicist or an editor or whatever else my choices were. none of that. i just wanted pretty much to write from what i knew and only what i wanted to write so basically just gourn it forever. and self indulge and even if i wasn't writing about myself i would still be writing FROM myself and it would be no good. that's way...way too much me time. and me me me me me. when really the best part about writing is giving yourself away, and helping people. but first you have to write it. so really i just need to do something that isn't so solitary an give give give and then have that build me. i feel like the more i try to build myself the more i break down but if i help build others...then i build myself. into something much better. 
nursing school given i get in will be really hard esp. since i've never taken a science or math class in my life but...it would have been hard, as an adult, to gourn my life forever, like pouring water back and forth between a bucket, until it all spills, and then i am left with nothing, but probably a child, one dollar, and a misery that won't be healed because i have only given myself to myself. which is truly the last person i want to deal with me. and probably an expensive drug habit. okay. i'm going on a trip. down the entire mississippi river. the stupid water body that truly, truly, truly dictates and ruins my life.

WE'll SEE ABOUT THAT, KITTEN CABOODLES. he said it like this:
""there is no fucking way i'm kissing you"" then "" don't get shit faced like you did in new york either, if we hang out.""
AIM made it difficult, but i deciphered how he really meant to phrase his warning:
""don't get shit faced so that when we make out you will remember.""
so it was more of a romantic plea than anything.
i dream of ending my life and saving others. i dream both of a extended stay in a hospital bed, away from you and yall and this fucking mess we call day and night, and working at a hospital. i can't do both. i don't function like you. i don't much function at all.

"event","the icon of my live journal is truly how i feel on a reg basis. i'm so proud of my 15 (14???) year old self. 
i'm deliberating on whether or not to smoke in my ""bedroom."" aka, the computer room. i probably won't. 
so i had this dream last night where we were all in new orleans but it was all high school ppl like erin and kevi and katewin and em etc etc and all the other kids we graduated with. but anyways in the classroom before class started there was a sodi machine in the room, but it was filled with jewlery. so i put in 5 dollars worth of quarters to get a new nose ring (a spike) and then, to my DELIGHT, alllllll the change in the machine which was predominantly quarters came pouring out. i was like BUCK YEAH and only a few other kids in the class were there as early as i was so i told them about the quarters. we scooped and scooped and scooped hundreds and hundreds of quarters into our pockets and bags until the other kids came into class. the change kept filling up so there was enough change for all. 
so then i went to my seat, a tall lab chair, i told my fellow desk friends about the quarters. they reprimanded me.
""this is dishonest.""
""i can't believe you took the quarters.""
""i don't respect you anymore.""
i was like, hell you guys, yall aren't even my real ass friends. so i went to tell kevi and katelyn and erin and everyone who all had the same general reaction.
""no.""
i did not want to be shunned so i told the teacher about the sodi machine's malfunction. i dumped back all my quarters and subsequent newfound wealth, reluctantly, because obvi i'm in no position to lose any friends. then, the investigator came, and the three kids and i who took the change had to put it all out on the table. 
one girl took ONE DIME and placed it on the table like it was 1,000 dollars. she was COMMENDED for her bravery and honesty about giving the dime up. it was as if these people were WAY too rich as it was to not take the quarters.
the investigators were really proud and happy that we were honest about the money. i was pissed, because i really needed the quarters, and if i had just kept my mouth shut they would have been MINE. but anyways then they wanted to interview me on TV about the sodi machine malfunction and everything, which i did, angrily.
THEN, come to find out, basically every person in the room hoarded the quarters that they didn't put on the table for show. even the bitch with that fucking dignified dime. everyone else just kept their mouths shut about it, as if pretending like they didn't steal the quarters meant that they really didn't steal them, and so they didn't have to feel bad/ashamed about it. but they made me feel bad about it because i was honest about it. my GOOD LUCK. that i tried to SHARE. 
hell people. 
when i woke up, my first instinct was to call everyone i could remember in the dream and ask if they would have taken the quarters. 
then i took my meds."

in any event, i had this dream a few nights ago that i was on dawson's creek....like, 3rd season. michelle williams was younger and less depressed (4 obv reasons) and katie holmes was cruise-less. we ruined this lady's yard. i held a daisy up to my male costar and said, ""heeeeey dawson. put it in your hair."" i sort of felt like the 5th wheel, you know, but then i just felt terrible for ruining the neighbors beautiful garden, even tho it was in the script.

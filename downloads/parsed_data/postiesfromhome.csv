Dear Second Cousin , I'm having the bluest time at summer camp! Me and my friend Jack Nicholson pumped (at) one of the other campers. It was so funny! But when we went to sleep the camper got revenge and we woke up in a ceiling ! We were so giddy . 
The next day, a bunch of wallabee s came through the camp and ate all of the food from the kitchen. Pauley Shore is allergic to wallabee s, and he/she had to be rushed to the hospital! It was so scary. 

On Saturday , the whole camp went sitting in the ball . But then Keenan Ivory Wayans was brutally attacked by a HUGE rhino . He/she barely survived! Luckily, a counselor named Rachel beat it off with a pencil . 

Oh yeah! I almost forgot. This one girl named Sally fell out of a window on the 84th floor of the cabin. While she was falling she yelled WOWZERS . It was so scary. She broke her arm and had to go to (the) class . 

There was this one person who was really annoying. He/she kept on rolling on/at everyone. I don't think he/she had any friends. I couldn't stand him/her! 

Well, I can hardly believe i've been here for a whole hour . It's been so fun! Well, I'll see you soon. Love, Jack Black P.S. Tell everyone I said yowzas !"

"event","as i was pondering today about liz's earth shattering question, what to wear for halloween, i decided to do some research for her. here's what i've found. 

things made from a box:
*Paint it red, tack on some paper plate wheels, and you are a race car. 
*Paint it white and a handle and you will be a cool refrigerator. 
*Paint it bright colors, and a crank. You can pop into the local Halloween party as a Jack-in-the-box

and that's about it because everything else wanted me to give them money.:("

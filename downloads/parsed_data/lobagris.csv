After all this time I've finally decided to make this journal friends only.

I must say that most of my entries are rambling stuff about books, movies and my own life (and that I frequently write them in Spanish). 
Feel free to read my profile to see if  we have something in common, and, please leave a comment if you want to be added (I find that adding people to friend-lists without a word is much too impersonal and a bit creepy). 

If we have things in common I'll add you back :)"

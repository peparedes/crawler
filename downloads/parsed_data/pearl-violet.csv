Oh yeah. I was supposed to get together with <lj user=""firstlemming""> and <lj user=""guyfie""> Thursday but I don't want to anymore.  I'm so tired of seeing the same people.  

And also it's so not fair that I have this morning off but nobody wants to do anything :-(.  I'll just sit home alone and cry.

"event","Last night my cat had kittens. 
<img src=""http://www.waxor.com/~zach/princess vag 3.jpg"" alt=""yay"" />
this is a close up of her vagina whith two of the embelical cords stretched out to the kittens breast-feeding.
it was a pretty rough pregnancy for her. she carried them for a really long time, and over the corse of four hours had seven kittens, then in the morning, had another.
<a href=""http://www.waxor.com/~zach/princess vag 2.jpg""><u>close-up picture</u></a>
<a href=""http://www.waxor.com/~zach/wonderofbirth1.AVI""><u>a video of the joy of childbirth</u></a>
<a href=""http://www.waxor.com/~zach/wonderofbirth3.AVI""><u>more video, turn the sound up</u></a>
<a href=""http://www.waxor.com/~zach/wonderofbirth21.AVI""><u>more video, slimey maggoty beasts</u></a>

we were a little worried during this last month that she might just have two full grown cats, but she had eight kittens and 2 pounds of placenta to eat (wich andrew stepped in after she ate it and threw it back up next to the drumset)  six lived, wich isnt bad the others are the most developed, and mobile newborns i have ever seen. the first video is a little rough, her fourth kitten didnt come out to fast and she really didnt want to be touched..

<a href=""http://www.waxor.com/~zach/amanda sean loft2.jpg""><u>with amanda and sean</u></a>.
<a href=""http://www.waxor.com/~zach/zach princess.jpg""><u>quick pic of me</u></a>, notice the hair color, amanda did it the day before, she wanted to try out this really nice european brand of toners. after 40v peroxide, its 50/50 pearl based lift toner combined with a violet based lift toner, then afterwards toned with a steal grey.
very nice

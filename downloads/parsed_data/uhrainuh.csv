"event","So yes, definitel nostalgia today.  I was packing up my room since my parents came to take stuff.  I had to pack up clothes, the took the tv and fridge.  As I was taking down pictures, I started to think about the past year.  So much has happened-good and bad.  I have grown so much as a person I feel like.  I have made a whole new set of best friends.  These people I want to know forever.  When I am old, they are the people I hope I am sitting on my porch with, ya know?  They are the people I want in or at my wedding, they are people that I want my kids to know and love.  Now I am thinking about how, after next year, I don't know what will happen with all of us.  Next year will def. be fun.  I love the girls so much.  They have made this year so fun, interesting, dramatic (hehe), and the best I could ever have imagined!"

<h2>Your Tongue's Talent is <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/kissing.html"">Kissing</a>!</h2>
You're the shy, silent type. You haven't had much experience at all, and you keep it quiet. 
<br><br>
You love playing sweet and innocent, but you have naughty fantasies too. Your sweet little tongue is perfect for teasing. 
<br><br>
You love to get your lovers all excited. But you can't keep letting them down, or you'll be left lonely.
<br><br>
Come out of your shell a little, experiment with new things. You've mastered kissing... it's time to be a little more daring!
<br><br>
You'd be most compatible with a Pussy Licker! This expert tongue magician will show you what's only been in your fantasies. You're inexperienced, so you don't want to go full blown just yet. A Pussy Licker will slowly inch towards the dark side.

"event","Why don't people see things outside of themselves?  Being able to see outside the box, or to put yourself in other people's shoes, or to see things from an outside perspective is key.  I guess sometimes people just can't do that.  There are things that I just don't understand.  I guess the way that you are raised makes up who you are.  Lack of a father (among other things), makes for big attachment to the first guy that shows ANY interest.  Twenty year old guys don't want to settle down with girls 9 states a way..most of the time.  Everyone has different feelings, ones that no one else will understand, I suppose...however, sometimes you DO need to listen to others and re-evaluate a situation.

Anyhow, these past few days have been depressing! haha  I mean, the whole guy thing anyhow.  I was talking to Jenny about it actually.  The girls have new people, new guys to get excited about..to get excited to see who has left them an IM or text message or voicemail; to hope for a call; to talk to; to talk about; not being able to contain the excitement over the smallest cute thing that they said..
I am happy for the three of them, of course, and I hope they know that..I really am.  It's just hard when you don't have someone too....EVER.."

Cancer is a comfort drinker -- and an extra wine<br>with dinner or an after-work beer or six can be<br>extra comforting, can't it, Cancer darling?<br>Like fellow water signs Scorpio and Pisces,<br>Crabs must guard against lushery. Cancers are<br>brilliant at ferreting out secret parties and<br>insinuating themselves on VIP lists -- and, in<br>true Hollywood style, Cancers are never really<br>drunk; instead, they get ""tired and<br>emotional"" (read: weepy when lubricated).<br>But there's nothing better than swapping<br>stories (and spit) over a few bottles of inky<br>red wine with your favorite Cancer.  Even your<br>second-favorite Cancer will do. The sign also<br>rules the flavor vanilla, and you'd be adored<br>if you served up vanilla vodka and soda.

"event","So I feel like lately I have really been missing out on a boyfriend or someone to be dating.  Usually it doesn't bother me..but lately, I dunno..it just has.  I mean, it definitely doesn't consume me or anything like that.  I think it's just because there is a new guy that could potentially be interested.  He seems good and is friends with a couple of my friends.  I guess he isn't my ""type"" although I guess I don't really have a type.  I feel like I really want things to work out or for SOMETHING to happen anyway.  He just seems very nonchalant about everything, like just very chill, which is a good thing, but it makes him hard to read.  Sooo, I don't know if he isn't interested or if it's that he just doesn't know me enough...I'm hoping it's the latter of the two.  Oh well, who knows..I'm not getting my hopes up because that just doesn't help anything.  I'll just try to hang out with him and talk to him more.  Bowling is good.  Grab-a-date I had to be flirty and cute..SOBER!  I'm glad I gave up alcohol but even more glad that Sarah gave it up with me!  When I was thinking about it before, being the only sober one sucks, but if I have a buddy it'll be totally fine.  So that was good news.  Anyway, thoughts about everything are scattered..I'm being a schizo!"

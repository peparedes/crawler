"event","<p>Well, as I am writting this, I am falling asleep. I am so tired. I had to wake up at 7 and go to work for like 4 1/2 hours. It doesnt seem like a lot but when your working it and its a very busy day, you get worn out. I went to work last night, it wasnt so bad i guess. Surprisingly, i actually sort of enjoy my job. Well enjoy isnt really thw word, it dont hate it. Its tollurable. Well i only have about 30 minutes left on&nbsp;my laptops battery so i wont be writting&nbsp;a lot today. I dont really have anything to say really. My friend invited me to fright fest for tomorrow. I cant wait! Its going to be weird because i worked at Discovery Kingdom over the summer. I hated working there. It was horrible. But at least i know the fasted ways around the park and all the good spots. ^_^&nbsp; I really cant wait. I need a day off from just life and hang out with my friends.&nbsp;All i want&nbsp;is to just relax. Well whatever. Well, we had a half day on friday and for some strange reason i was very&nbsp;disappointed when the guy that i like wasnt there. But after awhile, i was glad that he wasnt. I dont understand why.&nbsp;Do now get off topic, i hate scary movies. I get so freaked out. I have always been freaked out by them. But now when you see all of those comercials for scary movies its so rediculous! All of the scary movies out there are all the same! Its all practically the same plot just with different people! And all the people practically all die the same way. In some form of torture. Its so stupid. I find them very pointless and a waste of time. Well, i wish i could keep rambling about nothing but i only have about 15 minutes left so yeah...</p>"

"event","Well, today was an okay day. It was as great as it could get because of the fact that I had to go to school. I hate my school. I can't stand the stupid (literally) stupid people there. How they are even still there and not kicked out is beyond me. I go to a private&nbsp;Christian school. More then half of the people there aren't even Christian. Many of the people there pretend that they are but it's so obvious that they&nbsp;aren't.&nbsp;Our school goes to a camp every year called retreat and there we have chapel&nbsp;everyday. We have worship and there people are raising their hands and worshiping and&nbsp;praying.&nbsp;That all seems great, but&nbsp;that only happens at&nbsp;retreat. When we&nbsp;get back to school,&nbsp;the same people that raised their hands, aren't raising them and are talking to their friends about stuff that has nothing to&nbsp;do what the preacher is talking about. I don't always raise my hands and I'm not saying&nbsp;I don't say something to my friends during chapel, But I don't act like something I'm not. I do love God with all my heart and soul, but for a 16 year old, it's so hard for me to pay attention for long periods of time. That's why&nbsp;I don't like school because&nbsp;I can't focus&nbsp;very well. No, I don't have ADD, it's just how&nbsp;I am. Weird&nbsp;I know. Anyways, want&nbsp;I really wanted to say was that today in chapel, the guy that&nbsp;I was talk about before, he sat right behind me. I felt really unconfortable for some weird reason. Chapel lasted lasted about maybe an hour. I didn't&nbsp;know how to act or what to do. I want to him to notice me for&nbsp;who&nbsp;I&nbsp;am and....I&nbsp;don't know. I can't really think right now for some reason. Tonight I have to go out to dinner with my mom (which is okay&nbsp;I don't mind), my oma (grandma who I really love) and my uncle (I really can't even stand him!). I know that sounds horrible but there are so&nbsp; many things about him I really don't like. I really don't want to get into all the details about it because&nbsp;I have o leave soon&nbsp;and I still have to study for a Bible test tomorrow, but tomorrow I will share what happened at dinner&nbsp;and of course about my day. Man, I have to work tomorrow. That's another thing, I really hate my job. It is one of the worst jobs ever! Anyways.........&nbsp;"

Okay, well you see i really like this guy at my school. I mean really really like. I dont love him because i dont really know him&nbsp;all that well. I really wish i did know him better though. He is a great guy. Hes a Christian, hes so smart, hes very talkative but in a good way. He has&nbsp;great oppinions about very important issues. Also not to mention hes very cute. Hes very sarcastic just like me and we also have many other things in common. I know it sounds&nbsp;like i should just talk to him or whatever right? Well im trying too. In spanish class today i started to really&nbsp;talk to him (ive been in the past few weeks but today i talked a lot). And today is when i finally realized that i more then just like him i really&nbsp;really like him!&nbsp;Today when i was driving home, he was all i could think about. I couldnt get him out of my mind, but im not sure if i really&nbsp;wanted to or not.&nbsp;The horrible thing is is that i know he doesnt like me that way.&nbsp;I dont&nbsp;think he ever will. I am not the prettiest person ever and im not that skinny either (im not way over weight either)(i have a poof as i like to call it). Anyways, i know that things could happen in the future but i just dont see it ever happening. We are a lot a like but i dont know if im the type of girl he likes.&nbsp;I have the&nbsp;worst luck with guys. I&nbsp;keep getting hurt after&nbsp;everyone i like. They never like me back. I dont know whats wrong&nbsp;with me. Im not saying that &nbsp;i wish that a guy would like me, i just wish i was different so that i would be accepted a little more. I know that God made everyone with a certain design and purpose and made us all unique. But im afraid that God made me too unique. I dont want to be like everyone else all skinny like and pretty, i want to be me but a different me. Not one thats so annoying at times and just a little pretty and a little more skinnier. I want to be a different me. Im sorry God for saying this but its true. I dont hate you for making me this way and im not even the tiniest bit mad. I just pray that even if this guy doesnt like me, but that there is someone out there just for me and no one else, that will love me for who i am and how you made me. I dont ever want to be like a girl on the magazines, i just want to be me and maybe a little less. I dont want to be hurt any more. Please God can you help me!?"

yes?

the birthday was great.
i got two shots at the doctor's, but i made sure that i got a sticker.
just cause im 17 doesn't mean i can't have a sticker, people.

i realized that i need to go to college for multiple reasons.
one is that i have too many options here, but many are sub par.
there&nbsp;can be&nbsp;many more options there, making it more probable to find the perfect option.
but what's the probability of choosing the wrong option?

senior year i will broaden my horizons even more than i did this year, which was tremendous.

"event","<pre>Somewhere there's speaking, it's already coming in
Oh and it's rising in the back of your mind
You never could get it unless you were fed it
Now you're here, and you don't know why

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen, listen and wait for
The echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

You're waiting for someone to put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight and watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine with all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island and into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice, but you still hide away
Anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want, he's everything you need
He's everything inside of you that you wish you could be
He says all the right things at exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you, and you don't know why

I am everything you want, I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you that you wish you could be
I say all the right things at exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you, and I don't know why

And I don't know why
Why, why
I don't know</pre>"

i miss my old friends.&nbsp; i took the sats in the same room as my friend molly from natick.
i hung out with her and one of her friends before sats started and during the breaks.&nbsp; i really liked them.
some of those girls are still friends, and i wish i still hung out with them.&nbsp; i wish i grew up with them more.
my friend allie and i have been talking about getting together forever.&nbsp; once school starts winding down hopefully we'll find some time.
i love all my friends here, but sometimes i need a change of scenery.&nbsp;&nbsp;
i like meeting new people.&nbsp; or in this case, re-meeting old people."

"event","I'm glad to see everyone in school doing a little better.&nbsp; Monday was just horrible.&nbsp; For me, the morning was rough but I think that as time went on I just got a little numb from my emotions cause I was just so&nbsp;drained- emotionally and physically.&nbsp; The past few days have made me so glad that&nbsp;I am a peer counselor because I talked to so many people and it was obvious how much it helped.

I also learned one of the most powerful lessons I have ever learned- that I can put an idea into action to help a lot of people.&nbsp; I realized that a lot of people were talking about not knowing what to do with themselves.&nbsp; All they could really do was immerse themselves in their grief, cause there was nothing else to think about at all.&nbsp; So, I figured a movie would be a good way for people to get their minds off things, just to have a little break, at least for an hour or two.&nbsp; Brynn and Carolyn helped me, and we ran it by Mrs. Poulten, who thought it was a good idea.&nbsp; Then we talked to Mr. Jackson who agreed as long as we could find Max and a decent movie.&nbsp; So we got Max's schedule from the office and found him and he said he could run it.&nbsp; Brynn was the one who thought of Mrs. Coutu having The Sandlot, which is such a perfect movie.&nbsp; Such a classic.&nbsp; So Carolyn and I then went to meet with Mr. Pearson to make it all official and he agreed to send an email out to all the teachers and make an announcement.

First I went to the sound booth to make sure it started off smoothly, then went back to check on the guidance area, and then Carolyn and I went into the actual auditorium.&nbsp; There were so many more people than I expected, almost filled.&nbsp; Then a funny part came and everyone laughed.&nbsp; I cried.&nbsp; I had spent the whole day until that moment having people collapse into my arms in tears, seeing everyone walk around with red eyes, or absent mindedly fill out a word puzzle.&nbsp; It was the best feeling in the world to hear all of those people laugh...and it was so overwhelming that it was a result of my idea.


Our school is really an amazing place.&nbsp; It really is.&nbsp; We have so many opportunities available to us and so many people here to help us.&nbsp; It's so cool that we can pull together the way that we have.&nbsp; Every single person in our school has shown&nbsp;he or she shares a&nbsp;vulnerability in life with everyone else.&nbsp; We're all trying to pull through the same situation together, all in our different ways.&nbsp; We can all thank Nick for the closeness that he caused in our school.

Today at lunch a kid I've never talked to before turned to me and laughed and pointed out that the forks were labeled as spoons and the spoons were labeled as forks.&nbsp; I liked that.

It was incredible to see how many people showed up for the lacrosse game yesterday.&nbsp; I can't help but wonder what exactly we were supporting.&nbsp; Was it Nick, the lacrosse team, or was it each other?&nbsp; All of the above?

Maybe the world isn't that bad.&nbsp; It was so nice of St. Sebastien's to think of us and send those flowers.&nbsp; It's so hard to think about other people when you're going through a tragedy of your own.&nbsp; And I thought it was so powerful when the Bellingham boys shouted ""Souza!"" in their huddle at the end of the game.

It's still so weird to think that of all people, it had to be Nick.&nbsp; He was the kind of kid who had just always been there since elementary school.&nbsp; I never really personally knew him well, but he hung out in my neighborhood a lot; my sister had a crush on him when they were little; I always heard his name or saw him around town.&nbsp; Death is such a hard concept to grasp.&nbsp; I can picture his face or hear his name and be okay, but when I really put the two together it's so hard not to cry.

I told a some people on Monday about my dream Sunday night.&nbsp; I'll tell you all on here because I really loved the meaning of it.

I was at Mrs. Heller's house (this isn't weird cause I was there for hours sunday night working on the ribbons we passed out) when she got the call about Nick.&nbsp; He was actually there at her house, sitting on the couch with me and everyone else who was there.&nbsp; Mrs. Heller hung up and told us all the news and Nick just started laughing and joking around about it.&nbsp; That's just so like him too.&nbsp; I really don't think he wants us to take this too seriously.&nbsp; There's no way not to, but I think he would want everyone to smile just like he would if he was still here."

"event","i'm so happy with myself.<br /><br />i just sat down at the piano with pad of paper with one complete song, and two incomplete songs that i've been wanting to put music to.&nbsp; i completely finished one of them, and i love it.&nbsp; i think it's called...hm...Need You to Know, or When You're Gone, or Let You Go?&nbsp; i don't know.&nbsp; i really hate titles with a passion they always sound so cliche.&nbsp; i wrote most of the lyrics to it in June, and i thought it was the corniest thing ever, but i like the melody and the piano.&nbsp; they make it sound okay.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""What Are We"">What are we<br />What do we call ourselves<br />Am I yours<br />Can I call you mine?<br />What are we<br />Besides far apart?<br />My heart's with you<br />Even when you're gone<br /><br />Cause maybe I love you<br />And I need you to know<br />That I want you in my life<br />I'm not gonna let you go<br /><br />Doesn't matter what people say<br />They won't try to understand us anyway<br />Take a dive into uncharted seas<br />See what you can find when you're with me<br /><br />Cause maybe I love you<br />And I need you to know<br />That I want you in my life<br />I'm not gonna let you go<br /><br />What are we<br />What do we call ourselves<br />Am I yours<br />Can I call you mine?<br />What are we<br />Besides far apart?<br />My heart's with you<br />Even when you're gone<br /><br />Cause maybe I love you<br />And I need you to know<br />That I want you in my life<br />I'm not gonna let you go<br /></div><br /><br />then i wrote one that isn't finished yet, it's probably called Harder.&nbsp; (that's what she said)<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Harder"">They say patience is a virtue<br />And from what I can tell<br />That's true, that's true<br />But I ain't got no stories<br />To prove that theory to you, to you<br />But I can show you the life of a girl living on impulse<br />A girl who'll hold on to the closest branch<br />When the strongest is just out of reach<br /><br />Why couldn't she try harder?<br />Did she just give up<br />Or did she just break down?<br />I'm sure if she could have tried harder<br />She would, she would, she would<br /><br />They say time is everything<br />But my thoughts about that<br />I don't know, don't know<br />I'd like to talk about it<br />But you've probably got places to go, to go<br />They say faith is starting up the stairs<br />Although you can't see the next floor<br />That I know, I believe I know<br /></div><br /><br />the last one i'm so close to being done, it's just really hard and i still have a few things to work out, like the ordering and the ending.&nbsp; I like the lyrics though.&nbsp; here's how they are on my paper, but the ordering will definitely change.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""sweet lies"">you're in a world that can be so cold<br />so i don't blame you for wanting someone to hold<br />but why the juggling act?<br />couldn't you decide?<br /><br />you left me hanging on to a thread that's slowly breaking<br />yet it kept holding on and you continued taking<br />til i let go<br />and floated gently to the ground<br /><br />sweet lies<br />i know about her<br />you've got your sweet lies<br />i'm falling under<br /><br />the boy from down the street has offered to buy me a meal<br />he probably doesn't know that my heart's&nbsp;impossible to steal<br />since i've locked it up so tight<br />i've never done that before...those<br /><br />sweet lies<br />i know about her<br />you've got your sweet lies<br />i'm falling under<br /><br />""come stay a while, "" you say<br />but it's hard to stay in a place that keeps revolving<br /></div><br /><br />now, because of that, i still have a whole book to take notes on, and a very very pained back.&nbsp; oh well.&nbsp;<br /><strong>let me know what you think. =).</strong>"

"event","<p>everyone updated about musical being over.<br />so, i won't, if this doesn't count.<br /><br />but as long as we're on the subject, my past two weekends have been work in the morning and musical at night on saturday, and work all day on sunday.&nbsp; seriously, i've had no life at all.&nbsp; and i can't see the floor in my room because i attempted to go through my closet.&nbsp; me being organized only turns my life into more of a mess.<br /><br />it's official.&nbsp; i'm visiting BU april 17th.&nbsp; i'm excited.&nbsp; we're also trying to book UMass Amherst, Sacred Heart, and a few other schools.<br /><br />i'm definitely going in undeclared.&nbsp; i think i've decided not to go for education because i can go back for that later, but i definitely want to minor in spanish, and do either psychology or marketing...<br /><br />once my parents heard that i'm interested in marketing they really started trying to push me in that direction because there is more money in it.&nbsp; i think it would be fun.&nbsp; i could be creative.&nbsp; and i would need psych classes for it too.<br /><br />now, on to my immediate future.&nbsp; i want to get my hair cut like this: <a href=""http://cache.eonline.com/Gossip/Answer/Images/210.clarkson.kelly.050306.jpg"">http://cache.eonline.com/Gossip/Answer/Images/210.clarkson.kelly.050306.jpg</a><br /><a href=""http://hosted.ap.org/photos/N/NY11301190125-big.jpg"">http://hosted.ap.org/photos/N/NY11301190125-big.jpg</a><br /><br />dare i get my bangs back? oh, i dare.<br /><br />also, last night was the worst night of my life, but that's exaggerating.&nbsp; what is not exaggerating is to say that my cousin dan is one of my favorite people in this world.&nbsp; i really talked to him for the first time last summer and we kept in touch more than anyone.&nbsp; i'm really happy about that.&nbsp; i think he's been thinking about going to school in boston (he lives in new york).&nbsp; that'd be sweet.<br /><br />school time.<br /><br /></p>"

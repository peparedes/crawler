This weekend has been so up and down it is insane I feel like it's lasted ten million years. School on Friday or actually the absense of school on Friday was fun. I was like one of the first people that was like um...the back parking lot is flooding, I fell asleep in my friends car and woke up and I was like OMG what time is it then I look out side the car, and there are little waves rolling into the back parking lot. So sketchhhh....so I left and ditched class, got coffee and had a fun day not at school. Then at like six, everything got so shitty and fucked up...but kelsey, jess, sophia nicole & hannah came and picked me up we went to the game and kelsey made me hella happy while we texted in the bleachers. what else happened this weekend....
*went to In & out watched some drunk bitch get slapped
*went to Ian's 
*listened to hella mario LET ME LOVE YOU
*went to edgar's house...so funnny
*went to chris' house bought up even though i was the youngest one thurr
*I dared this girl from drake to wear a raiders beanie for 20 min and i paid her a dollar
*got smashed and watched doug litz (sp?) do drunken shit and i nearly peed my pants
*Watched chris dance to mario while watching himself in the mirror
*worked at the dumb candy store on sat
*ate out (hee hee) at CPK with caro and kell, and our waiter's name was Noel B. sliding under the booth, and watching a baby slip out of his seat while asleep.
*went to sarah's party....pretty fun hella crowded and fuckin' laughed when Donny & Tamir called me about the Bay shop
*Drove around and Rachel & Caitlin made me piss my pants laughing
*trying to smoke but couldn't find weed.
*eating paninis with rabbit lady from acri!

I wish I could remeber all the sick ryhmes from Saturday night

HAHHA

I dont think i have ever laughed and cried so much in one weekend

pshh i am tired
If you see me at school tomorrow give me a big hug...I really need it."

THEN.....scuyler picked some of us up....in da hummerrrr, and we went to car-ho-line's house to pick her up. where she flashed us all a lil caroline ass. hee hee slash I love you nunan! 

then we hellza departed to brandons house, which is always super fun! just as we got there though anthony tried to be all deep and give me a hug, and i was like um....kay.

 yooooou still are dating a giant cock! 

but we made up EVENTUALLY. Then we went into the kitchen and there we hella cuttsters just chillin! It made me happy that our crew finally found something to do!(alcohol comes into plot, coconut rum, yum)

THENNNNNN.....emily and alison and jackie and jessica and caroline and caroline and the coconut rum and i are all dancing upstairs, to what you ask?

Brandon is so nice. 
He always listens to me when i need to tell someone my problems.
he always stand up for me when people are mean.
Brandon also treats my sister really well.
He does community service with he even if he doesnt need the hours, he does it just to be with her.
I am so happy that he is such a good guy for her.

(sorry this is so random.)

but he deserves every bit of it!"

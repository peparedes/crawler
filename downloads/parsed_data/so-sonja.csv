"event","my mother is driving me nucking futs...she comes in and starts telling us stories while were watching our shows on HBO Now, which we only have the free trial. &nbsp;i&#39;m going crazy. &nbsp;i seriously wonder if she poisoned Logan somehow. &nbsp;he was fine, chasing Bluefire around the day before and then he got sick suddenly. &nbsp;he started peeing on the floor and mom got aggravated because he peed on a bag of books she had in her office. &nbsp;i thought he was doing it for spite, i didn&#39;t realize that something was wrong. &nbsp;that day I kept him in a cat carrier in my room so he couldn&#39;t pee all over the house. &nbsp;i noticed he was lethargic, so i called all the vets in the area to see if any of them would allow a payment plan. &nbsp;i found one that would an I had an appointment the following day at 1 pm. &nbsp;that evening, i let him out in the room so he could eat and use the litter box. &nbsp;he tried to pee in the litter box, he was in there for about 5-7 minutes, then he got out and tried to pee on the floor. &nbsp;he could not urinate that evening. &nbsp;i sat with him that night and made sure he was getting food and water. &nbsp;the morning came and he would not eat or drink. &nbsp;he would get up every couple of minutes and tried to pee on the floor. &nbsp;i was going to let him so I could see if there was blood in his urine. &nbsp;he could not pee and when he tried, he cried in pain. &nbsp;he was laying on my bed and whenever i pet him, he would cry in pain. &nbsp;i called the vet back and she said that he more than likely had stones/crystals in his kidneys. she said they could do surgery but it would be about 8000.00. &nbsp;she said they could not do a payment plan for that. &nbsp;i didn&#39;t know what to do. &nbsp;she said that i could bring him in for the payment plan, but the tests since he was not urinating would be upper hundreds to thousands of dollars and i would have to pay 30% up front. &nbsp;this was at 10 am, by this time his eyes were glazed over and his body was limp. &nbsp;i could tell his little body was shutting down. &nbsp;i called the animals shelters in hancock and pearl river county and asked if they would do the euthanizing for no or little charge. &nbsp;they said no, in case he was contagious. &nbsp;the vet would not do the payment plan for euthanizing. &nbsp;i called james and asked him to bring me a .22. &nbsp;it was the hardest decision i ever made, but he was suffering. &nbsp;by this point he was panting and crying in pain. &nbsp;my dad told me to take him to the creek in the field and just leave him out there. &nbsp;What the fuck? &nbsp;He was my baby, my therapist, my best friend. &nbsp;He has NEVER been outside of the house, he&#39;s sick and you want me to discard him like gum on my shoe? &nbsp;FUCK YOU. &nbsp;I&#39;m not going to abandon him in his time of sickness. &nbsp;he would be down there thinking I was mad at hiim for being sick, being scared and sick and not being able to do anything to defend or take care of himself. &nbsp;You heartless bastard. &nbsp;James came 30 minutes after I called him. &nbsp;I laid with Logan until he got there crying and telling him I was so sorry for being such a useless human that I could not take care of him. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t deserve him. &nbsp;I took Logan to the creek. &nbsp;He cried in pain as I held him and told him I was so sorry that he was sick and begged his forgiveness for what I was about to do. &nbsp;I told him I loved him so much and it was going to be okay in just a moment. &nbsp;James handed me the .22 and told me what to expect when I shot him. &nbsp;I hugged and kissed him and cried. &nbsp;Then I laid him on the ground, asked God to forgive me, told him I loved him and pulled the trigger. &nbsp;His body reacted and I went into shock. &nbsp;I held his body until he quit flopping. &nbsp;James dug a hole for me and I held a little service for him and buried him with his favorite toy.  
I don&#39;t know what I would do if I find out that my mother did something to him. &nbsp;She&#39;s already on my shit list for what she did to Phoenix. &nbsp;"

"event","well, austin lost his job at the beginning of february. &nbsp;no surprise there. &nbsp;we had several major things that needed to be done at the house that we couldn&#39;t afford. &nbsp;the electricity got cut off. &nbsp;we still had water. &nbsp;we stayed at the house for a few days. &nbsp;it got really hot and i could not sleep at night. &nbsp;we went to our friend, Rebecca&#39;s, house and stayed a couple of nights. &nbsp;the couch bed was so uncomfortable that i drove home and slept in the heat. &nbsp;Rebecca had a female dog that just had puppies about 3 weeks ago. &nbsp;she was not trying to house train them at all and just let them run about their house. &nbsp;she has a 6 month old baby that she would put on a blanket on the floor. &nbsp;the puppies would go over by the baby and piss and shit. &nbsp;there were dirty diapers EVERYWHERE. &nbsp;i couldn&#39;t take it and started cleaning. &nbsp;they have a pitbull outside on the porch on a chain. &nbsp;it was without water for 2 days and wouldn&#39;t eat because it was so thirsty. &nbsp;i told Rebecca about it and she said she would have her son give him water when he got home from school. &nbsp;well, when the son came home from school, she did not say anything to him about it. &nbsp;i asked him to please give the dog some water. &nbsp;the poor dog was so thirsty that he drank all of the water that they gave him. &nbsp;he started throwing up pure water. &nbsp;i gave him some more water. &nbsp;the poor dog never gets attention. &nbsp;the last pitbull they had on their porch died from the heat because they would never water it. &nbsp;anyway, the puppies were leaving piss and shit piles everywhere and they would just walk through on the carpet barefoot. &nbsp;Rebecca sat and played on her computer or watched Hulu all day and ignored the baby. &nbsp;the one time she did feed her when we were there, she gave the baby 1/2 a jar of sweet potatoes and one bottle of milk all day. &nbsp;the next day, i made the baby bottles and made her some mildly runny oatmeal baby cereal and added the sweet potatoes to that. &nbsp;the baby ate everything i made her. &nbsp;i got tired of cleaning, babysitting and puppy care, so i told austin that i would rather sit in the heat. &nbsp;we went home and a bad storm came up. &nbsp;it was a friday. &nbsp;we asked mom and dad if we could come out and watch the finale of the Amazing Race with them. &nbsp;we went back to our house and austin asked me if i would call my parents and ask them if we could stay with them a couple of days. &nbsp;we have been here since that Friday. &nbsp;dad has lots of stuff that he can&#39;t get mom to do on the computer for him. &nbsp;he has written one book and just completed another. &nbsp;i formatted it and got it all pretty for him. &nbsp;he wanted it printed on the front and back. &nbsp;Mom didn&#39;t know how to do that. &nbsp;we have been helping him maintain his lawn. &nbsp;either austin or i or both cook everyday for them. &nbsp;dad told me that he thinks God knew he needed us out here. &nbsp;this morning I got up at 5:45 and made breakfast for my dad. &nbsp;he broke his back again, last year. &nbsp;he went to Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg to have surgery. &nbsp;they gave him an infection on his spine that got into the bone. &nbsp;he has a weaken immune system now because of all the medication they had him on to kill the infection. &nbsp;three other people received infections after surgery there also. &nbsp;dad wanted to get a lawyer and sue for medical malpractice, but the lawyers all told him that it is nearly impossible to sue for malpractice in Mississippi. &nbsp;i wonder if he could file a civil suit against them?

"event","i started school on march 31st, i am studying medical office assistant. &nbsp;i am tired of being, broke and on disability. &nbsp;i want to do something with my life and make my sons proud of me. &nbsp;there are certain things that i want out of life and i know they are not going to be handed to me, i am going to have to work for them. &nbsp;the program is seven and a half months long and i will be nationally certified once i complete the program. &nbsp;they assist with job placement once i complete the program. &nbsp;i am enjoying it so far and making all a&#39;s.

the problem i am having right now is austin. &nbsp;he got laid off in february AGAIN...this seems to be a nasty cycle with him and frankly i am getting sick and tired of it. &nbsp;though this time it really wasn&#39;t his fault. &nbsp;the company opened too many call centers and shut his down. &nbsp;he is going on two months now of unemployment and has no motivation of seeking a job. &nbsp;he says that he looks for work while i am at school, but i don&#39;t know. &nbsp;when i am at home, i have to wake him up and he doesn&#39;t want to get out of bed. &nbsp;right now it is 1:07 pm and he is still sleeping. &nbsp;i am seeing how long he sleeps in today. &nbsp;i am wondering how long it takes him to get a job this time. &nbsp;it was seven months last time. &nbsp;i just can&#39;t take it anymore. &nbsp;i love him with all my heart but i just really don&#39;t know if i can go through this anymore. &nbsp;since we have been married his has been unemployed longer than he has been employed. &nbsp;he has no motivation or care. &nbsp;i am only off for one week this summer and i really want to spend that week with Phoenix. &nbsp;i am afraid that i won&#39;t have the money to rent a car and pay the gas to go get him and spend time with him. &nbsp;Austin&#39;s mom will pay for Austin to go and get Tyler (Austin&#39;s son) &nbsp;for us to have him this summer. &nbsp;I get so fed up and it&#39;s not fair and i&#39;m really pissed off about it. &nbsp;My parents won&#39;t help me get Phoenix. &nbsp;Then I have to tell Phoenix I can&#39;t afford for him to come and see me for the summer or Christmas. &nbsp;It&#39;s not the first time. &nbsp;It breaks my heart. &nbsp;But we always get Tyler. &nbsp;Or we get Tyler Christmas presents and my kids do without. &nbsp;I&#39;m sick of it. &nbsp;I&#39;m tired of the BS. &nbsp;If I don&#39;t get Phoenix this summer I think this will be the end for Austin and me.

"event","i had quite an experience tonight. &nbsp;austin and i were coming home from walmart this evening. &nbsp;we always take the back road that goes through the stennis buffer zone. &nbsp;there are no houses there. &nbsp;just trees and a gravel pit. &nbsp;when we were passing the VFW hall before entering the buffer zone i started getting sick at my stomach and then my field of vision got narrow and i started having visions. &nbsp;my vision went blank and i could not see anything. &nbsp;all i could see was black and smoke. &nbsp;when i get sick at my stomach i know that someone has been murdered. &nbsp;i started to panic and told austin that someone had been murdered or was about to be murdered. &nbsp;i told him that i could not see anything except blackness and smoke. &nbsp;i was in full panic because nothing like this has ever happened to me before. &nbsp;i could not see the road in front of us even though my eyes were wide open. &nbsp;i did not know where we were, i was just really sick at my stomach and felt as though i was going to vomit. &nbsp;this went on for about 3 minutes. &nbsp;we passed the gravel pit and i was able to see where we were at and i felt refreshed and my stomach felt fine. &nbsp; &nbsp;i don&#39;t know if Spirit was showing me a murder that happened there, is going to happen there or what. &nbsp;i am so confused. &nbsp;i am still shakened by the whole experience. &nbsp;i had austin freaked out too.

"event","this man contacted me a few months ago for a tarot reading and guidance and i have been helping him since then. &nbsp;a little info on his situation. &nbsp;he is 49 and gay. &nbsp;he fell in love with a much younger Ukrainian man who is not gay and they became friends. &nbsp;he lived with this man and helped him get a job and get US citizenship. &nbsp;when the Ukrainian man got these things he dropped my friend like a hot potato leaving my friend in love and confused. &nbsp;my friend still has very strong feelings for this man even though the other man has never shown feelings in return. &nbsp;well, when the 49 year old man contacted me to do a basic tarot reading on his life i gave it to him. &nbsp;it showed that he was going through financial struggles, someone he loved had betrayed him, he would find a new love, he needed to budget his money and start saving and things would get better. &nbsp;i told him that he would get a raise or a promotion in his job. &nbsp;well, he told me he had just got a promotion in his job. &nbsp;he was struggling financially. &nbsp;he was just hung up on Max (the Ukrainian man). &nbsp;i asked my friend who is Wiccan if there was anything he could do to rid him of his energy and she gave me a prayer to St. Michael. &nbsp;he did the prayer and who of all people showed up at his apartment the next day? &nbsp;Max! &nbsp;now he is more confused than ever. &nbsp;he sent an email to Max and gave him an ultimatum. &nbsp;now he has become bitter. &nbsp;he thinks that nothing in his life is going right. &nbsp;he has cursed God and denounced Christianity. &nbsp;which is his choice, i don&#39;t have a problem with that. &nbsp;he is a very negative person. &nbsp;he is constantly asking my advice and when i give it to him he writes me very negative emails back and it is taking a very emotional drain on me. &nbsp;i don&#39;t know how much more i can take. &nbsp;i have done everything i can to try to help this man. &nbsp;i seriously think he is beyond helping. &nbsp;he is bringing me down mentally. &nbsp;i don&#39;t know what to do. &nbsp;should i cut ties with him? &nbsp;if so how do i go about doing it?

"event","i have been on a mental and spiritual journey the past few weeks. &nbsp;i was thinking about going back to school but i was denied financial aid (i attempted too many hours and did not complete them) so i was not given a pell grant and cannot apply for a student loan. &nbsp;my credit is too poor to get a personal loan to get a semester under my belt. &nbsp;i tried that route too. &nbsp;i have been doing all of austin&#39;s paperwork for him and getting him enrolled in school. &nbsp;he is just clueless sometimes and incapable. &nbsp;i have everything ready for him. &nbsp;now the problem is he doesn&#39;t have a part-time or job at all and cannot afford the gas to go to school. &nbsp;he has been off from his job on a medical leave for over a month now and cannot return without a MRI and a doctor&#39;s note saying he can return and we cannot afford either one. &nbsp;we had to pay his medical bills back in june for the neurologist and that put us behind on our rent (it&#39;s only $290 but might as well be $1,000,000 right now). &nbsp;i managed to pay one month on the rent at the beginning of august and the landlord informed me that the rent has gone up on our lot from $125 a month to $150 and that there is a late fee now of $2.00 a day. &nbsp;he said that since i did not know that he would not charge me the past months that we are late but if we are late on rent in september there would be a late fee for the month. &nbsp;what i want to know is since we do not have a written lease on our property can he just increase our rent like that without some form of notification in writing? &nbsp;i&#39;m going to contact an attorney today.

since i have been under so much stress lately with austin being so non-caring about our situation my visions have stopped. &nbsp; i&#39;m hoping that it&#39;s just stress and that they have not permanently stopped. &nbsp;i have decided to start working with tarot cards too. &nbsp;to be honest i have always been scared of them. &nbsp;i was always raised that tarot and psychics are evil and the work of the devil so i have been scared of them. &nbsp;i did some research on them and found out they started out as a card game. &nbsp;i have a friend on facebook that designs tarot cards and i asked her some questions about them and she gave me some words of wisdom. &nbsp;&quot;They are just tools. &nbsp;Cardstock with images on them. &nbsp;Just like a hammer or a gun, the purpose or intent behind them is all up to the person using them&quot; &nbsp;I believe that my gift is from God and i want to use it to help people. &nbsp;if using tarot cards can enhance that and help people i don&#39;t see that as evil and i shouldn&#39;t be afraid of it. &nbsp;i went on amazon.com and found a book that explains everything about tarot, all of the cards, the different layouts, etc. &nbsp;then i found a deck that i really like. &nbsp;now, i just need the money to get them.

well austin is home now and has ruined my concentration so i guess that is all for now...."

then at 8:30pm i had a lady from nashville call me. &nbsp;she saw the ad on craigslist and wanted a reading. &nbsp;same thing. &nbsp;i explained to her that i was about to eat supper. &nbsp;took down her name and question. &nbsp;(i got a lot of love questions today) meditated, got the answer and called her back after we ate dinner and watched our show.

we went to the ER again yesterday with austin&#39;s arm. &nbsp;the ER in slidell, la is MUCH better than the one here in picayune. &nbsp;the doctor actually examined austin&#39;s arm and hands and determined that he has nerve damage. &nbsp;i have to call my neurologist and schedule an appointment for austin tomorrow and see if we can get him in ASAP. &nbsp;austin&#39;s boss is being a butthead. &nbsp;he wants us to drive an hour to hattiesburg tomorrow to bring austin&#39;s work excuses (austin&#39;s er doctor told him to stay out until july 4th). &nbsp;austin can&#39;t use his hand. &nbsp;he told me tonight that he almost called me into the bathroom to unbutton his pants for him that is how bad it hurts.

it definately has been a busy day between austin being down and me running the house today and making cigarettes (we roll our own), and cooking and everything else that has been going on, i didn&#39;t realize how much austin does around here. &nbsp;lol &nbsp; i&#39;m SPOILED.

"event","life right now is trying to see the glass as half full. &nbsp;life with Spirit is amazing and I feel as though i am headed in a positive direction with that aspect of my life. &nbsp;i am happy with where that is going. &nbsp;my only problem i am running into with that is i don&#39;t have anyone to practice on. &nbsp;i ran an ad on craigslist <a href=""http://hattiesburg.craigslist.org/crs/3889787327.html"" target=""_blank"">http://hattiesburg.craigslist.org/crs/3889787327.html</a>. &nbsp;i am hoping that if i give free sessions and practice on people that i will gain confidence and experience.  

austin is having a hard time with his job. &nbsp;he is not fast enough that once he starts getting paid per unit that he will not make much money. &nbsp;he needs to make 70 units a day to make decent wages at what he is doing. &nbsp;i told him i would do a session today to see if Spirit would show me anything helpful. &nbsp;he is stressed and frustrated.  

Angie (Phoenix&#39;s stepmom) sent me a picture text message last night of the artwork that i made for Phoenix when he was a baby in broken pieces. the text said, &quot;sorry about the pictures&quot;. &nbsp;no explanation. &nbsp;Phoenix called me today and told me that one of the kids that Angie keeps occasionally broke all three of them. &nbsp;he said he cried and cried. &nbsp;this is not the first time that kid has broken Phoenix&#39;s stuff. i was livid. &nbsp;i told Phoenix i would get the supplies and we would make new ones together this summer when he visits.

Robert got a new job doing over-the-road trucking. &nbsp;that means that he is not going to be home to help raise our son. &nbsp;AGAIN. &nbsp;Angie treats Phoenix like the proverbial redheaded stepchild. &nbsp;i can&#39;t wait to file for custody and take him away from them. &nbsp;he soaks up my love when he is here. &nbsp;he never wants to go home. &nbsp;he always asks if he can stay longer. &nbsp;it breaks my heart. &nbsp;he told me today that the best part of summer was going to be able to spend it with me. &nbsp;i have been accumulating evidence against Robert and Angie for a while. &nbsp;i consulted an attorney and he said it wasn&#39;t enough. &nbsp;Robert spanks Phoenix because Phoenix lies. &nbsp;I told Robert that I strongly disagree with spanking and he said, &quot;Well, we will have to agree to disagree&quot;. &nbsp; &nbsp;i lied a lot as a child. &nbsp;i don&#39;t know why. &nbsp;i have a huge imagination. i got spanked for it but i would do it again and again. &nbsp;i don&#39;t believe in spanking. &nbsp;i believe you should explain to a child what they did wrong and why it is wrong and why they are being punished for it. &nbsp;spanking causes fear not respect. &nbsp;i do the best i can with Phoenix when he is here. &nbsp;he is so brain-washed by them.

"event","this afternoon i was playing on a website called www.psychic-experiences.com and i was taking various psychic tests. &nbsp;during one of the tests i asked my spirit guide to help me to see the answer. &nbsp;i heard, &quot;close the computer&quot;. &nbsp;so i did. &nbsp;then i heard, &quot;would you like to meet me?&quot; &nbsp;I was like, &quot;of course, i would love too!!&quot; &nbsp;so i closed my eyes and meditated. &nbsp; i knew instantly that it was my protective spirit because of the color (rose). &nbsp; my entire mind was filled with the color rose. &nbsp;then the color went away. &nbsp;next, my livingroom appeared before my eyes. &nbsp;except instead of being in front of me as it should be it was to the right of me. &nbsp;the three colors of my spirit guides that i know of appeared before me along the ceiling (rose, yellow and white). &nbsp;all of that went away and i was left in the darkness for about two minutes. &nbsp;i thought that my spirit guide was done with me when i saw a bright blue sky spiraling up from the bottom of my view. &nbsp;it had big fluffy clouds. &nbsp;then the sky appeared all across my mind&#39;s view and my rose spirit guide appeared as a red cloud. &nbsp;i asked, &quot;so you are a red cloud?&quot; (i didn&#39;t get it at first) &nbsp;we floated through the sky, my body felt weightless as i floated with my Spirit Guide. &nbsp;i asked, &quot;what is your name?&quot; &nbsp;the sky vanished and my sandy wall appeared (which usually happens when they want to spell something out to me) and i came out of my meditation. &nbsp;i was thinking about my experience when it dawned on me.

Protective guides are usually rose colored. &nbsp;Protective guides are usually Native American. &nbsp;He was telling me his name not his form. &nbsp;I&#39;m just daft. &nbsp;His name was Red Cloud. &nbsp;So may I introduce you to Red Cloud.

"event","not much going on lately. &nbsp;austin&#39;s son, tyler, has been with us the past two weeks. &nbsp;we took him home yesterday. &nbsp;we had to rent a car because our car is on it&#39;s last leg. &nbsp;the air conditioner doesn&#39;t work and it needs a tune-up something awful. &nbsp;the trip wasn&#39;t bad because they met us halfway so it was only an 8 hour trip instead of 16.  

i haven&#39;t been able to do my psychic sessions lately because tyler has been sleeping in my meditation room and when he was awake i didn&#39;t want to leave him for an hour while i went and meditated. &nbsp;today though i meditated and got a couple of answers. &nbsp;i asked, &quot;If i file for custody of Phoenix now who will get custody of him? &nbsp;Robert or I? &nbsp;It took about 3 minutes but a sandy wall appeared in front of my closed eyes and Spirit spelled out ROBERT. &nbsp;i was kinda bummed out, but I understand we don&#39;t always get the answers we want. &nbsp;i know i don&#39;t have enough evidence against them right now anyways. &nbsp; the second thing i asked was, &quot;Am i on the right path? &nbsp;Should i pursue the medium/psychic investigator path?&quot; &nbsp;Again it took about 3 minutes and I saw my Spirit Guide and heard, &quot;Do you trust me?&quot; I replied, &quot;Yes, of course I do&quot; and heard, &quot;Then it will work out&quot;.

i&#39;ve been having a lot of health problems lately. &nbsp;my right knee is BAD. &nbsp;i have a tear, lesions, thin cartliage, &nbsp;and hardening connective tissue. &nbsp;i am going tuesday the 25th to Hattiesburg to an Orthopedic surgeon to make arrangement for surgery. &nbsp;i&#39;m kinda nervous about that. &nbsp;then yesterday my doctor called me and told me i have moderate arthritis in my neck vertebrae. &nbsp;i asked her what we can do about that and she said nothing but take ibuprofen and put ice on it. &nbsp;GREAT!! &nbsp;my hands and fingers and numb and tingle sometimes. &nbsp;she said it is from the arthritis in my neck. &nbsp;SIGH. &nbsp;i&#39;m falling apart. &nbsp; GETTING OLD SUCKS!!

i refuse to have a birthday next year!

"event","i got my two books in the mail thursday. &nbsp;the first one is <u>The Art of Mediumship: Psychic Investigation, Clairvoyance, and Channeling</u> and the second one is <u>Discover your Psychic Type: Developing and Using Your Natural Intuition.</u>  &nbsp; I discovered many interesting things by reading the books. &nbsp;The first is that I am a cross between a mental and emotional psychic.  

I decided to do a reading on myself. &nbsp;I asked Spirit if I should tell my parents and my family and Austin&#39;s family that I am psychic? &nbsp;I saw a night sky with stars. &nbsp;I took it to mean that I should keep them in the dark and not tell them. &nbsp;Then I looked up stars in my psychic symbols book and this is what it says:

<div><b>Star( s): may indicate the vastness of life and existence; may represent dreams and wishes; may represent psychic ability or intuition; can indicate a famous person; may represent someone who wants to be a star or famous; may suggest someone who needs to be the center of attention; as in &ldquo;thank your lucky stars,&rdquo; be very grateful; as in &ldquo;catch a shooting star,&rdquo; have all the happiness and excitement you need;</b></div><div>Barnum, Melanie (2012-06-01).

so i don&#39;t really know what to make of it. &nbsp; i know that i still have A LOT to learn. &nbsp;i am enjoying it though.

"event","austin is so sweet. &nbsp;he worked at a house today and the lady had a few cats that had 15 kittens. &nbsp;one of them was a solid gray male that was born with a bob tail. &nbsp;he had NO tail whatsoever. &nbsp;not even a nub. &nbsp;austin wanted to bring him home, but he had another job to do and he didn&#39;t want to leave him in his van while he was working. &nbsp;he said he was going to bring him home to me for Mother&#39;s Day. &nbsp;i thought that was such a sweet gesture. &nbsp;he said that if he is in the area tomorrow or the next day and the lady still has him, that he will go and get him for me. &nbsp;that will bring our total kitty family to 3. &nbsp;one female and two males. &nbsp;bluefire, our female has been spade. &nbsp;she came that way when we got her. &nbsp;she was eight months old. &nbsp;we got her at the animal shelter. &nbsp;we were walking through the cages of cats and she reached out and grabbed austin like take me home. &nbsp;austin took her out of the cage and put her in my lap. &nbsp;she rolled on her back and went to sleep. &nbsp;she looks like barca_k&#39;s cassie. &nbsp;i was sold. &nbsp;we adopted her. &nbsp;best $80 ever. &nbsp;that was in 2009. &nbsp;then last year in october we got logan. &nbsp;he is black and white. &nbsp;he wears a mask and has awesome eyebrows and goatee. &nbsp;he is my sweet baby boy. &nbsp;he is a very vocal cat. &nbsp;we named him logan because he looks like wolverine. &nbsp;he has a pink milk belly. &nbsp;when i got him i was drinking a strawberry milk and he helped himself. &nbsp;his tummy is pink like the strawberry milk. &nbsp;he was 8 weeks old when we got him. &nbsp;he was free from a lady in ocean springs, ms. &nbsp;i really hope we get this little male kitty. &nbsp;i would name him maxwell silver hammer and call mim maxwell. &nbsp;logan is due to get neutered next week. &nbsp;poor baby, i hate to do it, but we have to.


it&#39;s 4:48 am and i am waiting for 6 am to get here. &nbsp;i&#39;ve been up all night. &nbsp;it&#39;s that moon phase where i stay up all night. &nbsp;i figure if i go to bed now, i won&#39;t get up at 6 to make austin&#39;s gatorade and sandwiches. &nbsp;i was going to play on facebook but it is giving me error messages.

didn&#39;t do my psychic work today. &nbsp;i&#39;ve had a migraine all day. &nbsp;i did call the phone number listed for the missing lady. &nbsp;it went to the police station. &nbsp;it went to the jail because it was after hours when i called. &nbsp;i told the deputy who i was and why i was calling. &nbsp;he told me that if i called tomorrow between 8 am and 5 pm that i could talk to a detective. &nbsp;he said that he knows that the case for the missing woman is still open. &nbsp;she is still missing. &nbsp;i thought maybe if i called i might get a better vision? &nbsp;they may think i&#39;m kooky. &nbsp;the deputy didn&#39;t laugh at me or anything. &nbsp;he listened and was very nice. &nbsp;i didn&#39;t tell them what i&#39;ve seen so far, i want to talk to a detective first.

i just remembered that austin didn&#39;t put his ice packs in the freezer last night. &nbsp;he is going to have to buy lunch today. &nbsp;i&#39;m still going to have to make his gatorade. &nbsp;sigh. &nbsp;smack. &nbsp;i&#39;m going to have to start doing that for him. &nbsp;he never remembers. &nbsp;his sandwiches won&#39;t stay fresh without his ice packs and they aren&#39;t frozen. &nbsp;they are still in his lunchbox which is on the floor. &nbsp;oh goodness.

"event","<p>when austin left to go to monroe, la i quit working on my psychic work and talking to my spirit guide. &nbsp;when austin got back i started my period and then got sick with bronchitis and a sinus infection that i am just now getting over and haven&#39;t felt like talking to my spirit guide and my head hurt and haven&#39;t felt like channeling. &nbsp;i came across a show on the BIO channel called Psychic Kids and the kids were given the challenge to help with a missing persons case. &nbsp;they were just given a picture and name of the person. &nbsp;then apart they gave details of the crime. &nbsp;the kids gave very similar accounts of the crime. &nbsp;i have decided that i would like to become a psychic investigator. &nbsp;i was going to college to become a crime scene investigator. &nbsp;i have always been attracted to that kind of work.

yesterday i sat down with my laptop and went to a website and searched for Mississippi missing persons. &nbsp;i came across a woman named Vickie Ellington. &nbsp;she has been missing since 2011. &nbsp;i said my protection prayer and looked at her picture, said her name and then closed my eyes. &nbsp;my spirit guide came to me (my spirit guide still comes to me as a maroon mist) and then something happened that has never happened before. i saw a mound in the maroon mist, then the maroon mist disappeared and it turned into a forest floor. &nbsp;then there were trees and foliage everywhere. &nbsp;tall pine trees. &nbsp;then the pine trees disappeared and i saw a pit, like a gravel pit or a creek bed. &nbsp;so i am thinking she is buried near a creek bed or gravel pit. &nbsp;i couldn&#39;t focus and opened my eyes. &nbsp;i waited a few minutes and then went back under. &nbsp;this time my spirit guide came back to me and the only way to explain what happened next is to say my field of view got very small, like a very small TV and it was like i was watching tv. &nbsp;i was watching a video of a forest and it was moving very fast. &nbsp;this went on for about a minute. &nbsp;it was different angles of the forest on a small square screen and then i came out of focus and my eyes opened. &nbsp;this time when i came out of my trance i had a very bad headache and i was nauseated. &nbsp;i decided that was enough for the day. &nbsp;i have never experienced actual pictures before. &nbsp;it has always been shapes and colors. &nbsp;so it was neat to see video and pictures this time.

i feel refreshed and alert today so i think i may try again. &nbsp;i will post any new information i receive. &nbsp;if i get any important information i may call the phone number and let the police know. &nbsp;they may think i&#39;m crazy. &nbsp;what if i&#39;m right?

austin suggested i keep the journal because he was noticing a pattern in my moods. &nbsp;i noticed that my periods always showed up with the full moons. &nbsp;it has been 6 full moons now that they have been spot on since i&#39;ve started my research. &nbsp;i have tried to see if anyone else is affected by the moon phases but i find very limited research. &nbsp;i was wondering if anyone has any similar experiences?

"event","our male cat, logan, is not happy that Austin is home. &nbsp;he has been sleeping with me in the big bed since Austin was gone and now that Austin is back he has nowhere to sleep with us. &nbsp;he protested the first few nights. &nbsp;lol

poor Austin...it rained HARD yesterday and he had to work in it all day. &nbsp;he didn&#39;t have a rain suit. &nbsp;he was SOAKED from head to toe. &nbsp;he came home and his underwear and socks were drenched. &nbsp;i spent the evening with my hair dryer drying his work boots. &nbsp;they weigh about 8 pounds each and he wanted put them in the dryer. &nbsp;*headdesk* &nbsp;i told him he would kill our dryer. &nbsp;i got them pretty dry with the hair dryer. &nbsp;it took me a while. &nbsp;luckily, they are mostly canvas.

Austin is really enjoying his job and is really taking to it. &nbsp;right now he has a calibrated tech riding with him. &nbsp;the tech said he is doing a GREAT job and is learning quickly. &nbsp;that made Austin feel good.  

our cell phones (both of them) have crapped out at the same time and we need them. &nbsp;we have decided to go with Verizon. &nbsp;we get good signal in our house (which is surprising). &nbsp;we really don&#39;t get good cell phone signal inside our house due to the tin roof. &nbsp;Verizon is the only company that we get signal with. &nbsp;right now we can get a Samsung Galaxy 3 for $100 each so that is what we are going to do. &nbsp;we have to wait until the 3rd when we both get paid.  

i didn&#39;t get on the nuvigil. &nbsp;they didn&#39;t authorize it and there is no substitute for it. &nbsp;so, i guess i&#39;ll just be sleepy all day. &nbsp;i&#39;ve been driving myself to my doctor&#39;s appointments. &nbsp;it&#39;s been nerve racking because i haven&#39;t driven in four years. &nbsp;tomorrow, i get injections in both knees. &nbsp;hopefully, i should be able to drive myself home.

that is what is going on right now.

"event","austin is home and life is back to &quot;normal&quot;...i had a doctor&#39;s appointment yesterday. &nbsp;i have sleep apnea and sleep with a CPAP machine and still get sleepy about 2 hours after i get up. &nbsp;i get 7-8 hours of sleep each night, but i don&#39;t feel well rested. &nbsp;he diagnosed me with uncontrolled daytime somnolence. &nbsp;he prescribed me nuvigil. &nbsp;the only problem is my insurance doesn&#39;t cover it and i have to have a prior authorization to get it. &nbsp;they are working on it to get me the medication. &nbsp;i hope it helps. &nbsp;i don&#39;t drink coffee, tea or sodas. &nbsp;so, i&#39;m not getting any caffeine. &nbsp;i lost three pounds while austin was gone. &nbsp;i didn&#39;t eat the first week he was gone.

austin started his job today. &nbsp;they are organizing his van and getting him ready for his first job by himself. &nbsp;he is scheduled to do a job with a calibrated tech this afternoon. &nbsp;austin will do the work, the tech will watch and guide austin as he does the work. &nbsp;austin was like a kid going to school for the first time. &nbsp;he was nervous, ready and kinda scared all at the same time. &nbsp;he is ready though.  

there is big money to be made with this job. &nbsp;the LEAST he can make before taxes each week is $690. &nbsp;that is only if he does minimum jobs. &nbsp;one guy last year made $95,000.00 he has been with the company 5 years. &nbsp;they offer paid vacation, 401k, health insurance and all kinds of bonuses and benefits. &nbsp;it&#39;s a great company and we are really blessed that austin got this job.  

we are going to start out putting 5% in 401k and once we get our bills caught up we want to start putting 10% because they match 100% and that will certainly add up. &nbsp;then austin and i don&#39;t go to church, but for our tithes we want our 10% to go to a charity that deals with helping children. &nbsp;so, we are going to donate to st. jude&#39;s children&#39;s hospital. &nbsp;we are going to save up and donate quarterly.

this morning austin&#39;s nephew went with us to drive me back to his house so i could drive the car home because austin gets a work van. &nbsp;he gets to drive it home and to drive it back and forth to work. &nbsp;they pay for the gas and etc. and he&#39;ll have a gas card. &nbsp;he goes once a week to get his supplies. &nbsp;it&#39;s really neat.

right now...life is GREAT!!!!...

"event","i called monday morning at 8:00 when Pine Grove opened. &nbsp;they asked me to come in for an assessment at 1:00 pm that afternoon. &nbsp;i called my mom and she brought me to their office here in Picayune. &nbsp;i talked to Donna and she asked me all kinds of questions ranging from my mental state as of right now to have i ever tried to commit suicide (yes, twice before). &nbsp; &nbsp;she filled out the questionnaire as i talked and cried and determined that i was suffering from a lack of coping skills. &nbsp;she didn&#39;t think that they would accept me for in-patient care. &nbsp;she called Hattiesburg and the doctor was not in the office and she talked to his nurse practioner (sp) and they did not accept me because i was not suicidal, homicidal or psychotic. &nbsp;so, i got my mom to take me to wal-mart and i got a weeks worth of food to wait it out at home. &nbsp;i don&#39;t have anywhere else to go.

austin and i downloaded skype. &nbsp;it helps to see him, even if it is over the computer. &nbsp;i don&#39;t know why we didn&#39;t think of it sooner. &nbsp;i was having to wait to talk to him after 7pm when he had free minutes on our niece&#39;s cell phone. &nbsp;that is one reason why i was so depressed was not being able to talk to him. &nbsp;i am just hoping that this week goes by fast. &nbsp;austin is so homesick too.  

austin told me to pick out a necklace for my birthday on may 2nd. &nbsp;this is the one that i want:

"event","i am missing austin so bad right now. &nbsp;this past week has been so hard for me. &nbsp;i didn&#39;t realize how much i rely on him for stuff. &nbsp;he is my rock. &nbsp;i am not coping without him. &nbsp;nobody has called except austin to check on me to see how i am doing. &nbsp;we had two bad storms. &nbsp;i can handle rain but storms push me over the edge, especially if i am by myself. &nbsp;thursday was extremely bad. &nbsp;the tornado sirens were going off and i had no way of getting out of the house. &nbsp;i just gathered up the cats and got in the bathroom until they went off for a while and the bad weather passed. &nbsp;i was so scared. &nbsp;i cry every day because i am so lonely.

i talked to austin and told him my mental state has diminished rapidly and i need to do something about it. &nbsp;i don&#39;t want to go to my parent&#39;s house because they think that there is nothing wrong with me. &nbsp;i don&#39;t want to bother Austin&#39;s mom. &nbsp;she has enough on her plate and austin&#39;s sisters really pissed me off saturday, but that is another story itself.

i have decided that monday i am going to admit myself into pine grove. &nbsp;it is an inpatient treatment center for mental health. &nbsp;here are some of the services they offer.

as for austin&#39;s family...

saturday his sister&#39;s got his mom and drove right by my house (they know i&#39;m alone) and went out to eat and then went to Ponchatoula to the strawberry festival and didn&#39;t invite me. &nbsp;they posted pictures and said they were having a girls day out. &nbsp;it really hurt my feelings. &nbsp;i thought they liked me. &nbsp;they invited other family members. &nbsp;Austin was pissed that they didn&#39;t invite me. &nbsp;i don&#39;t want to go out there and be around them anymore. &nbsp;i bawled my eyes out.

anyway...this is my life as of right now.

i have been doing my psychic sessions again. &nbsp;i had been frustrated that i have not yet seen my Spirit Guide. &nbsp;i don&#39;t know his/her name. &nbsp;i don&#39;t know what they look like. &nbsp;i was able to get to my beach of time the other night and saw my spirit guide approaching but lost focus as they got closer. &nbsp;then last night i asked my Spirit Guide to visit me and was able to get to my beach of time and saw a burnt orange mist. &nbsp;it just floated there for a while. &nbsp;today, i did some research and found out that your spirit guide can be a person, a waterfall, an animal totem, or just a MIST. &nbsp;so, today i meditated and the same burnt orange mist appeared from the right and floated to my left vision area and hung around for a while. &nbsp;i talked to it but it didn&#39;t say anything. &nbsp;it started shape shifting like growing hair. &nbsp;so, i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to change. &nbsp;i don&#39;t &nbsp;have anything to reference it to. &nbsp;i&#39;m trying not to get discouraged because i don&#39;t have anyone to talk to this about and this is all new to me. &nbsp;i wish i had a mentor. &nbsp;there is a store in slidell that may offer intuitive classes. &nbsp;i want to go to them. &nbsp;they don&#39;t call them psychic classes. &nbsp;but, it&#39;s the same thing.

austin quit his job at the gas station. &nbsp;he was promised a job with a friend of mine to deliver bread with the local Bunny Bread route. &nbsp;Jonathan changed his mind and hired someone else after austin had already quit his job. &nbsp;austin applied with a company called J Kaulk Firestopping Inc. &nbsp;He would be doing caulking and manual labor (basic construction duties). &nbsp;they have not called him back. &nbsp;Austin saw a job on facebook for Satellites Unlimited. &nbsp;he applied on tuesday and they called him wednesday for an over-the-phone interview. &nbsp;he is scheduled to go friday for an in-person interview. &nbsp;i did a psychic session an saw him actually getting the job. &nbsp;we shall see. &nbsp;he has done satellite install before and cable installation before. &nbsp;he is looking forward to the work.

i did a psychic session last night and saw two things. &nbsp;i saw a sky with satellites. &nbsp;i guess signalling that austin would get the job with the company. &nbsp;then i saw red. &nbsp;the first time ever that i saw an actual color. &nbsp;i thought it had something to do with austin getting the job. &nbsp;i was wrong. &nbsp;i started my period in the middle of the night and was covered in blood. &nbsp;i had to get up and wash my sheets and clean my mattress. &nbsp;my body is in tune with the earth and moon. &nbsp;i forgot that it was the equinox and that i was going to start. &nbsp;i always start with the seasons and full moon. &nbsp;i keep track of these things.

last night austin and i were looking for a movie to watch on netflix. &nbsp;we were looking at the horror movies. &nbsp;they have subcategories like B movies. &nbsp;we were reading some of the descriptions and started getting tickled by the descriptions. &nbsp; austin started laughing and i started laughing at him and then we started laughing more at the titles of the movies and the descriptions of the titles and then austin misspoke and i lost it and started laughing so hard i actually peed on myself. &nbsp;then, i started crying because i had never done such a thing. &nbsp;i told austin, &quot;I&#39;m peeing&quot; and i was still laughing. &nbsp;he was laughing. &nbsp;i said, &quot;i don&#39;t know what to do. &nbsp;i can&#39;t stop. &nbsp;i can&#39;t get up because i&#39;ll leave a trail&quot;. &nbsp;so, i finally go it under control and made it to the bathroom. &nbsp;but, i did pee on myself and the couch. &nbsp;i had to clean the cushion last night. &nbsp;it was a mess. &nbsp;it was funny though. &nbsp;we were laughing so hard. &nbsp;i love austin. &nbsp;he didn&#39;t make me feel bad because i lost control. he laughed with me not at me. &nbsp;he&#39;s so sweet.

i hope everyone is enjoying the weather. &nbsp;it is so pretty here. &nbsp;the only complaint i have is the pine trees. &nbsp;the pollen is everywhere and it is playing havoc with my allergies.

"event","my session with Jack didn&#39;t go so well today. &nbsp;i didn&#39;t really get any answers to my questions. &nbsp;Jack seemed off and distant today. &nbsp;i brought a list of topics that i wanted to discuss with him. &nbsp;we would discuss one topic and then he would say, &quot;okay, what&#39;s the next topic?&quot; &nbsp;like he was trying to hurry me through my session. &nbsp;when it was close to time for me to be done i asked if he was ok that he seemed to be off today. &nbsp;he said that he was in a car accident two weeks ago and that he was out of the office all last week with a concussion. &nbsp;that he was having a hard time concentrating and remembering things. &nbsp;i told him that i understand. &nbsp;i knew that something was off because Jack usually engages me in our conversations and seems to be interested in what i have to say and today he just wasn&#39;t there.

he was interested in the knotting ritual that &nbsp;<lj user=""wardellen"" />&nbsp; gave me. &nbsp;he asked me if it worked. i told him that it did and that i feel like a great weight has been lifted off of me. that the knots that i tied in the cord were more than symbolic that it seemed like they released knots inside of me. &nbsp;not only did i burn the cord, but i burned the list of knots that i wrote out. &nbsp;i really don&#39;t want to think and linger on those those thoughts and feelings of hurt and anger anymore. &nbsp;i was able to release them through the knots and then to burn them and release them to the breeze. &nbsp;it felt good.

austin was supposed to wake up and take me to my appointment this morning. &nbsp;i have not driven a car in over a year. &nbsp;he put me in an anxiety attack. &nbsp;i had to drive myself. &nbsp;if i would have missed my appointment today, they would have cancelled my therapy sessions because i&#39;ve had to reschedule twice already because of his work schedule. &nbsp;we haven&#39;t been in sync lately. &nbsp;it seems we just occupy the house. &nbsp;i tell him i want to do things together with him and he tells me that we watch movies together. &nbsp;sigh. &nbsp;i meant like taking a cooking class or going to a food shelter and helping people. &nbsp;something together than sitting at home watching movies. &nbsp;we are in a rut and i&#39;m really tired of it. &nbsp;i&#39;ve been having migraines at the same time every night. &nbsp;

well, it&#39;s time for austin to be headed home. &nbsp;hope everyone is having a good evening.

"event","austin and i were headed home from taking his son home to tennessee back at the beginning of January and the song &quot;Iris&quot; by the goo goo dolls came on. &nbsp;it reminded me of the movie City of Angels. &nbsp;i got to thinking what if angels do have a choice to &quot;fall&quot;. &nbsp;God gave us free will. &nbsp;why wouldn&#39;t he give them the same privilege? &nbsp;BUT, what if they don&#39;t come back as adults? &nbsp;what if they are BORN to drug dealers, Christians, Catholics, Muslims, Pagans, Satanists, whatever across the world as newborns without the knowledge that they were once angels? &nbsp;this caused a great conversation between austin and me on the way home and I can&#39;t wait to share it with Jack. &nbsp;

i&#39;m not saying that i was once an angel. &nbsp;i know i suffer more than the rest of my family, my parents and my sisters. &nbsp;but what if? &nbsp;i have the gift of 6th sense. &nbsp;it is not always &quot;on&quot; but i do get premonitions and a sense of &quot;knowing&quot; what is to come and when people die or we are at the hospital people gravitate to me to talk to me to them calm down. i suffer in this world. &nbsp;no matter how hard i try to get ahead in life i seem to get knocked down. &nbsp;maybe it&#39;s part of living the &quot;human experience&quot; or maybe i&#39;m just nuts and it&#39;s just life.

i have been struggling with my Christianity as of late. &nbsp;barca_k knows that it&#39;s been an ongoing struggle. &nbsp;i do believe in God and i believe that Jesus died for my sins. &nbsp;i was saved and baptized in 1995. &nbsp;i question it daily though as to what i am doing wrong? &nbsp;why do austin and i suffer and scrape by when others flourish? &nbsp;maybe i&#39;m not living to my fullest? &nbsp;maybe i am taking for granted what i do have? &nbsp;we could be worse off.

i think i will go meditate and see what my spirit guide shows me.


i hope everyone had a blessed weekend.

"event","i talked to Jack, my therapist, about my parents and my decision to keep them out of my life. &nbsp;this is one of my new year&#39;s resolutions. &nbsp;to keep all things negative out of my life. &nbsp;this is basically what i discussed with Jack...

...my dad is a preacher. &nbsp;my mom plays the piano at the church on Sundays. &nbsp;my parents are racists. &nbsp;they love to use the word &quot;nigger&quot; and I was raised to use it too. &nbsp;i was taught prejudice against all people, not just black people. &nbsp;not to love mankind and to have patience and understanding as a &quot;Christian&quot; should. &nbsp;my parents would talk sweet and kind to someone and when that person would leave they would talk trash about them behind their back. &nbsp;

my father worked long hours to provide for us. &nbsp;we were very poor even though he did this. &nbsp;i think my parents hoarded money. &nbsp;i will discuss this later. &nbsp;we were never on welfare. &nbsp;my dad worked 60-80 hours a week. &nbsp;i know when he came home from work he was tired. &nbsp;my mother would never disciple me. &nbsp;she would wait until my father got home and the UNLOAD on him about how &quot;BAD&quot; i was during the day and then my father would take off his belt and beat me with it. &nbsp;of course, he would try to hit below the waist, but as i squirmed, i often got his wherever the belt landed. &nbsp;once, my grandmother told me i was so black and blue she almost called the police. &nbsp;i think my mother didn&#39;t want me sometimes and would often elaborate her stories just to see me get beaten. &nbsp;i know that sounds awful, but i look back and i wasn&#39;t a bad child. &nbsp;i was a normal one. &nbsp;a talking to would have done.

once, my mom told me to check the mail. &nbsp;well, we had a small walkway covered ditch and it had big&nbsp;caliche rocks (south texans know this) and i tripped on one and busted my head open on another. &nbsp;i had blood running down my face and into my eyes. &nbsp;i couldn&#39;t see anything. &nbsp; so, i started crying and screaming for my mom. &nbsp;she came out in her nightgown and robe and told me to come to her. &nbsp;that she wasn&#39;t coming to get me. &nbsp;she didn&#39;t want anyone to see her in her night clothes. &nbsp;we lived in the middle of a cotton field in the middle of nowhere and our road was seldom traveled. &nbsp; so i made my way to her, tripping and falling from a concussion, and being confused from the blood in my eyes. &nbsp;she would yell at me that i was going the wrong way. &nbsp;never once did she help me. &nbsp;when i made it to the house, she was not gentle in cleaning my wound and she did not take me to the doctor. &nbsp;now, this woman was a nurse before she married my father and knew i had a concussion. &nbsp; she knew i needed medical attention, but she did not take me to the doctor. &nbsp;my mother was a very lazy person.

my mother and father never got up and changed the tv channel themselves. &nbsp;we did not have a remote control tv. &nbsp;they would yell for me to come there and change the channel until they saw something they liked and then i could leave. &nbsp;i had to make them tea. &nbsp;they drank instant tea. &nbsp;i waited on them hand and foot for 18 years. &nbsp;

we lived next to the church that my father preached at. &nbsp;my mother often could not &quot;find&quot; her key to the church so she would open a window and put me in it in the dark and make me find my way in the dark and open the door for her. &nbsp;&nbsp;

when i was 6-7 my mother was pregnant with her 3rd child. &nbsp;she and my father were screaming at each other. &nbsp;i got my younger sister, Liz (Liz was 1 maybe 13 months old) and covered her ears and told her to be very quiet. &nbsp;my mom went to the bathroom and slammed the door. &nbsp;about 5-10 minutes later. she opened the door and called for my father to come there. &nbsp;my dad went into the bathroom and then came out. &nbsp;he went to the kitchen and got a bowl and returned to the bathroom. &nbsp;next, he came out of the bathroom and put the bowl on the kitchen table and told me to come there. &nbsp;Inside the bowl was a fetus. &nbsp;It was about 5-6 inches around. &nbsp;Inside the pink gelatin was a little baby. &nbsp;my dad&#39;s friend was a funeral home owner. &nbsp;he came and got the baby and we buried it. &nbsp;we named it baby shetter. &nbsp;my dad&#39;s welding friend made a little plaque and it&#39;s buried in alice, texas. &nbsp;it would have been my brother. &nbsp;about 10 months later, my final sister was born. &nbsp;it always bothered me that my father showed me that baby. &nbsp;Jack said that my father was grieving and that i was the only one that he had to grieve with at the moment. &nbsp;it was weird, but for some odd reason, my dad chose me to grieve with. &nbsp;i dunno.

i thought about telling my parents all the reasons i don&#39;t want to ever see them again. &nbsp;that they ruined my life. &nbsp;they manipulated me and still try to this day, by not liking austin and trying to get me to move back with them. &nbsp;Jack says it would be a lost cause that they wouldn&#39;t understand why i was telling them that and i would risk getting hurt again. &nbsp;i am so confused. &nbsp;i want to yell at them. &nbsp;tell them how seriously fucked up they raised me. &nbsp;i don&#39;t know what do. &nbsp;i might see if i can get another session with Jack soon.

i don&#39;t know if they really love me. &nbsp;i feel so alone when it comes to having my mother and father. &nbsp;it&#39;s like waking up on Christmas day and realizing there is no such thing as Santa. &nbsp;that it&#39;s all been an illusion.

at least i have a wonderful husband and my kids.

"event","i have been in a bad mood since my 20&#39;s. &nbsp;but, dr. mitchell put me on savella back in october. &nbsp;i started off at 25 mg and worked my way up to 100 mg a day. &nbsp;i started having these crying fits. &nbsp;i was terribly depressed and just all around blue. &nbsp;sunday hit a breaking point for me and luckily we didn&#39;t have anything in the house for me to hurt myself with. &nbsp;well, we have steak knives, but i didn&#39;t feel like sawing on my wrists. &nbsp;i just sat on the edge of the bed holding said steak knife in my hand wishing it were a tanto so i could commit seppuku on myself. &nbsp;i called austin at work and asked him to come home. he came home as quick as he could and calmed me down. &nbsp;i called dr. mitchell the next day and told him i needed to get off that medicine.

dr. mitchell put me on gabapentin 300 mg twice daily to help with my fibromyalgia. &nbsp;it does not mess with my serotonin levels. &nbsp;i should be okay on this one. &nbsp;i am feeling much better now that i am off the savella.

i&#39;m still depressed. &nbsp;we are really broke and i&#39;m trying to figure out how to get christmas presents for the three boys this year. &nbsp;i had to break phoenix&#39;s heart and tell him that i&#39;m not going to be able to get him this year for the holdiday. &nbsp;we are going to save up the money and get him for his spring break in march. &nbsp;austin&#39;s mom is going to pay for austin to get to see his son for the holiday. &nbsp;we are driving to tennessee to pick him up on the 27th and we&#39;ll have him until january 5th. &nbsp;wyatt is easy to shop for this year. &nbsp;he wants a pair of combat boots. &nbsp;i&#39;m trying to stay hopeful for....

"event","i don&#39;t know what i was expecting...i&#39;ve always had a 6th sense. &nbsp;i&#39;ve been reading, studying and practicing my psychic mediumship books. &nbsp;i guess i thought it would all fall into place and just &quot;OPEN&quot; up for me. &nbsp;austin said i have to be patient and realize that even though the gift is there, that i don&#39;t know how to fully utilize it all and it&#39;s going to take time for it to all come together.

he told me that you don&#39;t just read a book on algebra and suddenly know how to do all the mathematical equations. &nbsp;that makes sense to me.


today as i was meditating, trying to channel the loved ones of a neighbor&#39;s grandmother, my Granny came through. &nbsp;i was quite frustrated because this is how it happened....

the book said to picture yourself on a beach. &nbsp;you will see your spirit guide coming toward you. &nbsp;he/she will reveal themselves to you and you can see what they look like. &nbsp;well, this wasn&#39;t happening. &nbsp;then, i heard &quot;open your eyes.&quot; &nbsp;so, i opened my eyes. &nbsp;i didn&#39;t see anything. &nbsp;so, i closed my eyes. &nbsp;i still didn&#39;t see anything. &nbsp;this went on for a few more minutes of me questioning and me getting no answers and me getting more frustrated. &nbsp;finally, i felt a complete sense of LOVE take over my body from head to toe. &nbsp;(i was laying on the bed with my eyes closed). &nbsp;i heard, &quot;open your eyes you are done for now.&quot; &nbsp;when i sat up there was the painting of my grandmother. &nbsp;that was what i was supposed to be seeing and i wasn&#39;t looking completely. &nbsp;i was only focused on one thing. this morning when i woke up i saw a woman in a blue dress with brown hair. &nbsp;in the painting in my meditation room (our spare room) my granny is wearing a blue dress and she has brown hair. &nbsp;i didn&#39;t recognize her because when she passed away she had gray hair and she was very thin.&nbsp;

i realized i have MUCH to learn and that the spirits are not going to reveal things to me until i am ready and skilled enough to handle them. &nbsp;so, it&#39;s nice to know that my grandmother is one of my guides on the other side. &nbsp;

"event","<div><span style=""font-size:larger;""><span style=""font-size:smaller;"">tonight i may have found myself a new religion. &nbsp;i downloaded a new book called <u>Mediumship</u> by Derek Murray. &nbsp;it took me five hours to read. &nbsp;he does the best job so far of explaining how to receive messages from the departed. &nbsp;this is the BEST book by far that i have read on how to develop your psychic skills. &nbsp;derek murray also discusses his religion to a degree. &nbsp;he is a spiritualist. &nbsp;i have never heard of such a thing before. &nbsp;one branch even believes in God and Jesus (Christian Spiritualist). &nbsp;</span><br /><br />SPIRITUALISM AS AN ORGANIZED RELIGION </span>&nbsp;<br /><br />Spiritualism has one main belief. That the spirit world, coexists with the material world and when someone dies, their soul moves to the spirit world and from there continues to progress. &nbsp; As with all religions the idea is to become closer to God. There is also the firm belief that it is possible to communicate with the spirits of the departed and that they can give guidance to the living. They also try to follow a general code that can vary depending on which society you look at but are generally given as follows. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""font-size:larger;"">The Fatherhood of God:</span> They believe that God has infinite love and is perfect. That we are all a part of God, also that God has no end and is eternal.<br /><br /><span style=""font-size:larger;"">The Brotherhood of Man</span>: By giving your self to the service of others in a pure and unselfish way to assist others to make spiritual progress. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""font-size:larger;"">Communion of Spirits and the Ministry of Angels:</span> There is a firm belief that the departed are able to communicate with us. We all have spirit guides. Spiritualists know the soul is immortal and the personality stays unchanged when we die. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""font-size:larger;"">Continuous existence of the Human Soul:</span> The soul exists for eternity. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""font-size:larger;"">Personal Responsibility:</span> We are all responsible for our own thoughts and actions.&nbsp;We should continually strive to lead a good and moral life. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""font-size:larger;"">Compensation plus Retribution for all Good and Evil Deeds Done on Earth:</span> This principle can be summed up by what you do to others will be done to you. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style=""font-size:larger;"">Eternal Progress Open to Every Soul:</span> Progress is always being made and we must all strive to reach a higher spiritual awareness. &nbsp; There are far too many individual Spiritualist churches around the world. I would never be critical of any organization that places spiritual awareness at the forefront of their teaching.<br /><br /></div><div><u><span style=""font-size:smaller;"">Murray, Derek (2011-01-27). Mediumship (Kindle Locations 999-1006). &nbsp;. Kindle Edition.</span></u><br /></div><div>tonight i lit a candle, said my opening protection prayer and was able to get myself to my basic psychic level. &nbsp;a major accomplishment for me. &nbsp;i have never been able to get myself there before. &nbsp;nobody came through to talk to me or show me anything, but my senses were high. &nbsp;i could smell the ashtray across the room and the candle burning. &nbsp;i could see the candle flickering even though my eyes were closed. &nbsp; it was as though my body were asleep but my mind was as sharp as a tack. &nbsp;it was an AWESOME feeling. &nbsp;i can&#39;t wait to practice again tomorrow.<br /><br /><br />...</div>"

"event","goodness....where to start. &nbsp;it&#39;s been over a year since i&#39;ve updated my journal. &nbsp;so much has happened this past year that i don&#39;t even know where to begin. &nbsp;

doni kay moved home from minnesota. &nbsp;she is living with mom and dad. &nbsp;she still thinks that she is better than all of us &quot;rednecks&quot;. &nbsp;i can&#39;t stand her attitude and try to avoid her at all cost.

i found out that mom and dad do not like austin. &nbsp;they have hardly tried to get to know him and have based what they do know of him by what one woman at their church said. &nbsp;one of his ex co-workers from Sears said. &nbsp;real fine Christians my parents are, eh? &nbsp;anyway...i really don&#39;t talk to them anymore except to give them updates on Phoenix.

Phoenix has had ticks on his head the past four out of five days at school. &nbsp;he sleeps with his dog, flower, every night and he has been getting ticks in his hair from the dog. &nbsp;the teacher has said if he comes to school with ticks in his hair on more time that she is calling DHS on Robert and Angie. &nbsp;also, Phoenix has had lice 3 times this year. &nbsp;they are NOT taking care of my child. &nbsp;Robert accepted a job working on the road again and has left Phoenix in custody of Angie and I do not feel as though she is taking care of my child properly. &nbsp;I took a big risk the other evening and asked Phoenix when I was on the phone with him who he wanted to live with and he said me. &nbsp;i started crying. &nbsp;so, i am talking to a non-profit attorney right now trying to figure out how to get my son back.

austin got a job!! &nbsp;it&#39;s not exactly what he wants to be doing but it&#39;s better than nothing.

wyatt and i had a major mother-son breakthrough moment not too long ago. &nbsp;he just turned 16 and i felt as though it was time i told him some things about me/divorce/ghosts/mental illnesses. &nbsp;we had a really long talk and found out that we have so much in common. &nbsp;much more than i ever thought we did. &nbsp;he opened up and shared some pretty interesting secrets with me and austin. &nbsp;i thought that was awesome!! &nbsp;we are going november 3rd to new orleans to the french quarter to hang out. &nbsp;it&#39;ll be austin, wyatt, jeffery and me. &nbsp;then we are going to the cemetery to see marie laveau. &nbsp;i am going to mark three Xs with chalk on her tomb and leave her three cigars and ask for my wish three times. &nbsp; we shall see if it comes true. &nbsp;;P

my earliest memory of seeing a ghost was when i was 5 or 6 years old. &nbsp;i was sick and i woke up one morning and there was an older (late 40&#39;s to mid 50&#39;s) black lady sitting on my bed. &nbsp;it startled me. &nbsp;for the simple fact that we lived in a very small town in south texas and i had never seen a black person before. &nbsp;our little shack that we lived in was surrounded by cotton fields and i believe she was a ghost from a surrounding plantation and was checking on me because i was sick. &nbsp; the reason i bring this up is...i&#39;ve always had this gift...this &quot;knowing&quot; i guess. &nbsp;i&#39;ve always been afraid to explore it because it&#39;s always been labled the &quot;occult&quot; or &quot;satanic&quot;. &nbsp;why can i not have a &quot;GIFT FROM GOD?&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp;so, about two weeks ago i was &quot;googling&quot; psychic stuff and this book popped up from nowhere. &nbsp;it is called &quot;The Gift: Understand and Develop Your Psychic Abilities&quot;. &nbsp;i wasn&#39;t looking up books or anything it just popped up and it let me read quite a bit of it. &nbsp;so, i got hooked into reading it. &nbsp;so, austin put some money on the credit card so i could buy it off google play. &nbsp;i just finished reading the book. &nbsp;i no longer feel like a freak of nature. &nbsp;i did a practice &quot;reading&quot; on austin the other night. &nbsp;his father passed away from bone cancer. &nbsp;at first the information was coming slow, i was getting info like he wore a pinky ring and necklace. &nbsp;austin confirmed that he liked to wear jewelry. &nbsp;then i asked austin if his jewelry was stolen after his funeral and austin said yes. &nbsp;austin doesn&#39;t remember much about his father because he was twelve years old when his father died. &nbsp;i told austin, that his father was sorry for scaring him. &nbsp;austin said what do you me scaring me? &nbsp;i said, at the hospital. &nbsp;it was the morphine that made him mean. &nbsp;it scared you didn&#39;t it? &nbsp;austin said yes. &nbsp;it did. &nbsp;then his father kept bringing up the World Fair and was repeating it over and over again. &nbsp;i asked austin if that had any significance? &nbsp;he said that he went to the World Fair in New Orleans with his mother but couldn&#39;t remember if his father went or not. &nbsp;i hope that austin&#39;s dad visits me again to bring me more memories for austin. &nbsp;all austin remembers is him being sick and in the hospital and then his death. &nbsp;

i wish there was a chat community for people who are just learning how to use their psychic abilities so they could discuss and talk to other people out there. &nbsp;i am doing to try to start keeping up my journal again. &nbsp;i didn&#39;t mean to make this post so darn long.

if i don&#39;t write before halloween, may God bless everyone and have a safe holiday and enjoy each other and the weather!! &nbsp;isn&#39;t it wonderful??"

i love halloween because it&#39;s during the FALL. &nbsp;my favorite season. &nbsp;i love the colors and smells associated with hallloween. &nbsp;i don&#39;t consider it an EVIL holiday.....

i am going to do more research on the holiday and see how it ties to my christian beliefs....

in the meantime I hope everyone enjoys the weather and be nice to one another....

we got lots of rain from tropical storm Lee. &nbsp;i&#39;m not sure of the total, but it was much needed rain. &nbsp;i wish i could send some of the rain to texas to drown out the wild fires they are having there. &nbsp;robert and angie evacuated phoenix and their animals to a friends house to make sure they would all be safe. &nbsp;phoenix goes to school in bastrop. &nbsp;i have tried calling and texting robert and angie to see if they needed anything, but they do not respond to me.

wyatt is now a sophmore in high school. &nbsp;he had his 15th birthday on August 15. &nbsp;he called me the other day to get help with his algebra homework, but my phone did not ring and i did not know that he called until the day after.

i am loving this cooler weather. &nbsp;it hasn&#39;t been very hot during the day and the lows at night have been in the 60&#39;s. &nbsp;

"event","a few weeks ago, liz brought me a baby bunny. &nbsp;their dog, buddy, dug it up out of it's den and was using it as a chew toy. &nbsp;they didn't know how old it was or if it would live. &nbsp;they brought it to me because i have experience with wild animals and knew what to do.<br /><br />i determined that it was a girl bunny. &nbsp;i named her lucy since it is bad luck to name a rabbit lucky. &nbsp;her eyes were closed when we got her. &nbsp;that evening she opened them so i knew she was about 2 weeks old. &nbsp;i tried bottle feeding her and making her pee and poo, but she was old enough to do those things on her own. &nbsp;we picked her clover and grass and other delicious things for a bunny. &nbsp;we quickly fell in LOVE with this little bunny.<br /><br />she would follow me around the livingroom. &nbsp;all i had to do was make a little clicking noise and she would come running to me. &nbsp;she would even kiss you. &nbsp;our cat, bluefire, loved her too. &nbsp;she would clean her and love on her and snuggle with her. &nbsp; well, lucy got heartworms and died. &nbsp;it broke my heart and i cried all day saturday. &nbsp;even austin cried. &nbsp;he said he has never had an animal affect him the way lucy did. &nbsp;she burrowed her way into our hearts and i will always love that little wild bunny.<div>&nbsp;</div><div><img alt="""" src=""http://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e373/MsFirefly76/LiveJournal/103_0842.jpg"" /></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>God bless you Lucy. &nbsp;I love you with all my heart and I want to play with you again someday when we are in Heaven.&nbsp;</div>"

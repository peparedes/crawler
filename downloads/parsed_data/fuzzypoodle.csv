"event","Yesterday i either made the best decision or the worste. to try to make the hurt go away i went running. i forgot that it makes you throw up if you run to much. it really cleared my head. i wish i could run forever. maybe i'll just totally cut my self off from everyone. i just want it to be like it was in july........ I miss his voice., i miss knowing he loves me i miss his hand (my hand) i miss his comforting breath against my neck as we sleep. i miss him............bye"

"event","I'm so confused..... i konw what i want but i don't know what i need. I wentt o see logan this weekend. i don't know exactly how he felt . i felt akward most of the time. it wasn't the same.somethings diffrent.i don't know if it is my feelings or if we have just drifted so far apart that we don't know each other like we should. he seemed so happy. i wish i could have returned the feeling. i was happy for most of hte time but sometimes i jsut felt empty. I think i let it get liket his not on purpose but it just did. i don't think it is anyone's fault it just happened. i don't know what to do. i wish life was easy.or i could just leave and never come back. just run from everything and not have to deal with it................. bye"

"event","So I was working as an extra on scene for scrubs, seemingly shooting a new intro for the series, with a load of other people. My part was to just walk around while the main star wandered trough. I neve did see any cameras.. never saw any of the cast either...

Shortly after the first scene was done and we were supposed to move to another floor.. whereas we got less then a few minutes to climb two floors and get ready for a second shoot. How they move all the recordingstash and the crew, I got no idea... Time was short and I had to run like mad to make it, wich.. it seems I didnt. I was told by some strange random guy that if I missed another shoot, I would be booted..

And the next shoot was 8 additional floors up, on the roof. And I ran.. oh man I ran.. As I made it to the roof, it looked like something mixed from ghetto US and Starcraft. I had to climb rubble and metallic boxes to reach something looking like a helipad ontop where everyone was waiting.. and just as I made it up, the shoot started..

My first glimse of a star.. the character JD comes out of a door, typical rooftop staircase booth. JD wanders between us, then suddenly starts flying for a second... Then he lands, gets dressed and goes poof.. He wasnt naked, tho still seems like he needed to dress.. That arrogant prick didnt even say a word to anyone... That was lame. The shoot is done. 

Later that day we were told to get ready for the next shoot.. in a forrest somewhere, the dude from the filmcrew goes over our clothes and decides some had to get changed. In the dressingroom I see an old classmate of mine changing out of a fursuit.. guess you cant shoot scrubs in a fursuit <.< not that I saw him wearing it before.. or even attending any of the other shoots.. anyways it was a black and white suit, thick, dense fur.. and thats all I remember as I woke up."

"event","only 5 more weeks till EF and I am starting to get a bit excited. This year I bring no stupid crush or arguing exes, this year is gonna be fun and fun only.

I am out of town almost 2 weeks, leaving approximately 21 days time to finish my commissions, my suits, some badges and maybe 2 pics to try to sell there. That's really not much time :p But one of the trips will mainly be me and my sketchpad on a family cabin far far away. perfect relaxation and no stress. I think I'll bring ""Falling"", ""Jungle speed"" and some other cardgames just for fun.

Commissions: I got 4 pending ones left. Havent been able to draw much lately due to ""things"", but am getting back into it.

Suit: Same goes here. Been on hold for a while, but the bodysuit is almost done thanks to impressive help from kal. The head is the thing that worries me. I dont know if I am able to make it as good as I want it. Obsessive perfectionist I am :p The result would be that I wont make it in time. 

Badges: Cons always brings good business in badges.. or atleast for most other people :p I think I got 1 ordered and hoping for a few more. Anyone interested?

---

And back on topic. I am no longer sick sickety sick, proving that by co-hosting/hosting 2 furry gatherings the last 2 weekends. Man I need some sleep :p 4 days later and I am still worn out.

---
 Last, but not least. I need some hard advice!

The suit is made from an extremely reflective type fur. It is soft as gods, looks hyper realistic, but the seams show. I mean you can see where it's stitched together as it gets darker and doesnt reflect as much. Is there anything I can do? I can try to post images of it if anyone wants to see."

"event","Last night one of my cousins died... He has suffered from epileptic seizures the last few months, wich has left him tired and often hurt, tho last night the seizure was so powerfull it took his life. The boy only reached the age of 17.. He leaves behind a brother, mother, father and his yound rotweiler pup, wich are all shattered beyound anything.

I havent shed a tear for 7 years, tho today there was no helping it. He will be sorely missed by his family, relatives and friends. I wish to show my support, but I have trouble going over there, not knowing what to say or do.

I do belive he lived a good life, seeing his family was loving, well off and they spoiled him after he got his condition to easen his time, tho you cant hide the fact he had a very hard life. This makes me wonder.. isnt hardship supposed to be followed by better times? I can only belive he is in a way better place now, it being heaven or whatever good could possibly come after this life.

I wish to appologise for this post, seeing I havent posted in a while, tho just wish to ask (even tho I am not a religious man) for you all to pray for him.

As I cant see the screen anymore, I finish this post with.. you will be sorely missed."

"event","Coming up is an open spot from the fursuitmaker I wish to utilise. A rough estimate from prices I have overheard, it will land on anything between 1000 and 1500 us$. My current funds are far from that so I need to work real hard.

http://tinyurl.com/yk6fhwt <--- I set up this little donate button on paypal. If you find it in your heart to donate, I would be overly happy.

In addition I am opening up for commissions, starting at 10us$ going up depending on your request. Sadly I needed to reset the commission list somewhat due to well.. time passing, changed minds and my poor book keeping so I am currently down to zero commission queue. Those still interested in ordering a commission, send me a PM with the commission and I'll answer with a quote.

Aproximate prices can be found here. http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/1002532/


I am really sorry if this reset is disappointing or an inconvenience to anyone, but hey! you can donate! --> http://tinyurl.com/yk6fhwt"

"event","Just sent the last remaining guests to bed, finaly getting a moment to myself again, looking back I think this meet went damed great. Everyone behaved, we got to play a lot of games and I got in touch with two new furs.

Number of attendees were 14, where 1 was not a fur, copying the last record of 13 furs gathered. (this record set by swan.. as far as I know x.x) I am extremeley competitive and really wanna try and create bigger gatherings.

I love all of you guys for attending, next time I am hoping more will come and I'll try to spread the announcements more properly.

BTW, next time I am gonna host a meet is probably around the 20th november, hopefully managing my first ever birthday party ^^ never really had one before."

"event","Sadly I've followed the crowd, and have been bittin by the bug passing out the deadly senior-itus.  


UGHHHHHHHH I was doing so well this year too, almost all A's for sure no D's or F's, but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO it just had to bite.

NOW I've done my presentation for my English Senior Project, but didnt' turn it in because I didn't finish it.  My research piece has NO citations, I'm just going to but a sourse page in the back.  Compleatly BS'ing the paper because I'm uninspired so I don't want to do it.  Also I have to compleat anoter genra all tonight.  

Another project that's late is my Econ. Project.  I'm missing half of it, ok, MORE then half of it PLUS he takes off 50% for being late.  HOPEFULLY my B grade wont' go down to much more then a C and HOPEFULLY I do well enough on my final to keep it a C.


ANYWAY on a happyer note, I've found a new Drama:  Nobuta wo Produce.  It's pretty good, in a kinda bizarre way.  Inono, it keeps me wanting to watch more ALSO I think next I'll watch Hana Yori Dango, the Japanese virsion, if I like it enough I'll watch the Tiwanese virsion with the people from Mars and the acctual BAND F4.  xDDD is it just coincidence they PLAY the F4, I think NOT.  OH and I've still yet to compleat Tokyo Juliet, and of course Hana Kimi.   I WAS waiting for SUBLIMES butttt.  inono, if they keep up with it, I'll download thoes Hardsubs virsons and just watch the show in advance on youtube.  if I'm THAT impatiant."

"event","I don't define myself as a 'dreamer' but more of an escape artist, or illusionist.  Yes, I have become on a far lesser scale the magician I've wanted to be since childhood.  I yearned for this, not it the normal way a child says ""doctor"" or ""fireman"" when faced with the timelss question ""what do you want to be when you grow up,"" I truly wanted this.  I was facinated with learning such things as picking locks, trap doors, slight of hand, pick-pocketing, and use it in such a way to make people belive that somthing magical was happening right before there eyes, if only for a moment not know or remember the grim truth of smoke and mirrors.  If only I had a teacher, support, or even not getting the look of ""is this child crazy"" I might have had even more motivation to learn but a few long forgotten card tricks and slight of hand maneuvers; but my dreams were shatterd, as so many young ones are, leaving me fragments to sting when rubbed.  Still somehow I've managed to become this, not quite ""master"" illusionist.

My biggest escape I can actually do anywhere, and almost anytime.  The only physical tool I need, I can carry around with me all the time, in my hand, pocket, or bag.  I just sit down (or stand)on my bed, a bus stop, while waiting in a line, or anywhere really; pull out this little device and with a few words it sweeps me away.  My conscious for the most part is sucked inside this magical little world.  My surroundings change; I'm now in a field, sword in arm, fighting a foe twice my size, only my skill with a sword , and long years of training to help me.  Sometimes I'm in a city far away, on a crowded street dealing with everyday problems, or trying to live an ordinary life, with some sort of unordinarly ""talent,"" I'm a gifted loner who finds himself ina dangerous situation when others force him to go out with 'friends,' I'm the head cheerleader, and I have a secret that I have to protect from exposure.  I deal with all these problems as if they are really my own, I AM these diffrent people, living multiple lives.  This beautiful contraption of words on page after page, all bound neatly together, each a complete story, adventure, or life for me to live out, and goes by the strange and to some people, frightening name of ""book"".












This was a peice I did for my english class, at first I was going to go in the direction of my hiding my diffrent ""lives"".  Family self, Mom self, Sister self, Friend self, Real self somewhere mixed up in all that, but I thought that would be too long, and too personal to share in my English class, so I changed it, but kept the central ""illusionest"" idea.  I'm not so sure that's how it came accross, and I don't know that to ""outsiders"" is the focus clear?  do you get my connection with the ""escape artist""?


Tell me what you think, remember CONSTRUCTIVE critisim.

"event","I don't know. I feel like the internet has zapped my creativity. I feel like my space key doesn't work properly and it's driving me insane.

What happened to positivity? Creativity? What happened to the way things used to be in my life. Everything is a push, everything is a struggle. It always has been. Concerts, plays, brave things I used to do seem to fade away into this person who used to be, who never really existed in the first place. 
She's always here. 
Maybe it's my environment. Maybe being surrounded 24/7 by these people and this place has killed me, made me feel like I no longer have a place, no longer have a voice. I no longer seem to think what I have to say is valuable, is profound. I am too afraid to make mistakes, too afraid to step outside these lines that have been clearly drawn around me. Too afraid to take that leap, take that risk and just be, just do. I can move mountains, yet I'm too busy keeping myself in check to make sure that you're comfortable. 
And you are. But what about me? Perhaps I feed too much off of other people, therefore I have clearly chosen the wrong place. The walls are more in place now then they have ever been, and they take much longer to break down. This place where I don't quite belong, don't quite fit in; this place that has taken my home from me and replaced it with a feeling of transparency. 

I have a lot to say. I have a lot to sing, to dance, to draw and to create. And perhaps it's not the end of the world if I fake it, and perhaps it's not the end of the world if no one but me notices. Perhaps the only person I need to please is myself. And perhaps being alone isn't so bad as being surrounded by people who could care less about you, and who you are constantly trying to please. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I despise my space right now. And perhaps it is time I did something about it. 

Perhaps it is time to let go of the past and start creating a future instead."

All of my roommates are gone for the weekend, I am all alone. I went to Cara's tonight for a drunken monopoly night, although there was less drunk involved for me then I would have liked and less monopoly too! Oh well. Tovah and Megan came over beforehand, so that was fun. Life is interesting. I hate my hair, I got it cut at Hairmasters in the UCC because I have no money and Hillary isn't in London, Hillary is in Toronto so I can't have cool hair. Which blows. How can I lure in the ladies if I don't have cool hair? Hmmmm? That's right. I am doomed. /freak. I went to NeoTokyo though, and got another Chobits manga. :D Me likey. I need to get more stuff, and go clothes shopping because I've bought like one shirt in the last year and a half because I am so poor oh god kill me I am so poor. On a happy note, my hot f crushes were at Cara's soo *innocent* that was.. nice. Dayummm. That's all I have to say. I wish they'd be my friends?"

"event","It's odd thinking back to old friends and past times. Thing's you regret, things you wish you could do over, and even just things you wish you would have done and said. You'd think that'd make you learn from your mistakes and live life to the fullest, but for some reason things just continue as they are. Maybe I'm just growing gradually, so I don't see it happen. Maybe I am that much more mature and wise than I was 2, 4, 6 years ago, I just don't see it. It's funny that no matter how miserable and fucked up you were at the time, you still manage to look back at those times with a good feeling and almost a sense of fondness and yearning. People that affected you. People you would love to see and hang out with again. And yet you still continue hating the present. This is just a passing thought.. a passing feeling as well. But still enough of one to make me take notice."

"event","I am just SO frustrated with the George Bush, the war in Iraq, the war everywhere because of western capitalism, and america and western countries in general. And what frutrates me even more than that is blind patriotism and ignorance, and the blatant propaganda lies circulated. Do these people really not care, as long as it's disguised in the name of America and freedom? We are all so convinced that our way of life, and our christian religion and culture are superior, even if we say we don't. Why is OUR way better, so much better that we must force our way on everyone else. Destroy anyone with different views or beliefs. We are a free, thinking nation -- because of that, no one else in the world is? Just because their ways are different, doesn't mean they are anti-freedom or anything like that. It just drives me insane. We fight freedom with oppression. Isn't that somewhat contradictory? America, Bush, and western nations are DESTROYING this world, ruining any other religions besides christianity, ruining other cultures and ways of life in the name of freedom and under the disguise of genuinely caring and wanting to ""help"" these other places. 
   We denounce the muslims because of their hate for ""freedom"" and their forcefullness with their religion. In reality muslim nations and the west are exactly the same, each fighting to push their culture beliefs and religion on everyone. America just has more money, thats the only reason we are winning. We have the same methods of enforcing our wills on people, just one is more fancy than the other. This is evil. Pure evil. And America and Bush are leading this disgusting world deeper into it. We are oppressing the world, starving them and taking everything they have, and it even is close to home, oppressing women (just DIFFERENTLY than the muslims are doing it -- anyone outside our culture can see it clearly) with the media and religion and such, stifling homosexuals, and anyone else who doesn't fall into this ""perfect"" and ""free"" western lifestyle. We aren't freeing anyone. We are trapping ourselves, and now we're trying to drag everyone else down with us. I just wish people could see it clearly. We are not god, and we are not acting in anyone else's will but our own."

"event","Souuuuuuuu it's 7:45am and I can't sleep anymore even though I have 2 more hours to sleep. WTF? you might say. Well I will tell you. Ben is a meanie and snapped at me for not coming in on sunday, even though emma was leaving for 3-4 days *sniff* and I wanted to spend time with her before she left, even though mark said that they were just gonna go slap a second coat on the parts that have been painted once to just let the guy see what it would look like so therefore didn't need all 7 people, even though we had gotten up and gone to work every single day that week (even if we only stayed for half days due to rain and other things), and even though it's really not all that unreasonable for someone to take a sunday off when we're supposed to have weekends off. Apparently only Hillary and Mark showed up, and good for them!! They are hard little workers! But it's not my fault no one else showed up, and I don't deserve to get the entire load of everyone not coming dumped on my head. NOT very fair at all. Especially so early in the morning!! Only two more months of this crap, I hope I'll survive. 
   It's raining today, which means another day of not working, which sucks. I had yesterday off, so I'm kinda bored of sitting around. I think today I'll get some new bras though, its the perfect opportunity. Maybe do some shopping, go to the health food store, get some blank cd's, all the stuff I haven't had time to do yet. Ben's a jerk and he's ruining my life.
   Pride was amazing, such good energy, it was almost spiritual. I had so much fun, and it was just the best weekend ever. Anniversary was soooo nice, we had lots of fun, ate good food and drank good ale! ...ale I say! ALE! The Buck and Doe was fun for the half an hour I was there, Jessica's was awesome, drinking, swimming hot dogs and drunk robyn falling into ditches and picking lilies on airport rd. We had some great talks around the fire.  
  Life is decent. I can't wait to go back to school and live in my new beautiful house. But I will miss my friends in collingwood. I never see them really, but knowing they are there just makes me feel better. I will be so sad when I can't just call up gill and wendy and make them drive me to places and have a blast, or just have movie nights where we just buy a rediculous amount of junk food and pig out. Life is kinda hard.. sometimes I'm just not ready to grow up. I wish I lived closer to them. :(
   Anyways, time to gooo eat. Ta!"

The drug company Bristol-Meyers Squibb built a website to help AIDS research. If you let the page load, you can chose to ""light"" a candle anywhere in the world. Just chose the place, and chose why you're lighting it. I decided to light mine for hope. For every candle lit, they will donate $1 to AIDS research. Now they are going to donate a minimum of $100,000 but- if we can get more candles than that lit, think of all the extra money that will be donated. At last count, there are 3009 candles, a long way to go. Think how easy it is to give. Just a few clicks of the mouse, and you've helped fund a worthy cause, without ever having to leave your chair.

"event","Sooooo... life's been good lately. PEI was amazing, and I had a few weeks to relax, get things in perspective and such. I'm struggling with some random unwanted emotions lately, and I can't seem to figure them out or fix them. I guess time's the only cure for some things. It's amazing having emma back, :) and I am so happy! It's hard to find time to see eachother, what with working all the time and all, but we're still managing. I just wait for her weekends off. 

I'm going to be working at my dads office as a secretary for the next two weeks starting on monday. His secretary is leaving for a week and a half, so I'm taking her place. Random full time jobs. and after that... it's only like a week until uni. Wow. Time has just flown by. I can't wait to leave, honestly. I keep trying to be nice to my parents, because I don't want to piss them off so they take uni away. They've been bitchy about everything altely, so I've completely altared my style and just say sorry and apologize whenever they yell or accuse me of stupid things. Only a few more weeks till freedom, I keep tellign myself. Oh god I can't wait. I don't have to talk to them at all if I don't want to. I'm so pumped!!! 

Don't get me wrong, it's not that I hate them. I just feel it's time for me to go, and they're pulling me back because I'm still their little girl. Thats what parents do, it's an age old story. Anyways, it's been awhile so I thought I should update. I hope everyone's doing well. Cheers!"

I'm sick of being made feel like I'm stupid for not jumping on the fucking bandwagon and being a fucking moron too. I'm sick of having retarded friends who do stupid ass things, and when I get upset over it, they get mad at ME. WHY DO I BOTHER. If you wanna go drive around drunk, then fucking FINE. I just won't care anymore. I just wont talk to you anymore. You're just gonna get thrown in jail for killing my family, or killing yourself, so why bother even having a relationship. DRIVING DRUNK IS STUPID SO FUCK YOU IF YOU THINK YOU'RE FINE, and YOU'VE ONLY HAD A ""FEW BEERS"". Just because it doesnt' say driving high is illegal doesn't mean it isn't JUST AS BAD as driving drunk. They don't have it in the rules because HAVING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE IS ILLEGAL. FUCK YOU AND FUCK YOU FOR STANDING UP FOR PEOPLE LIKE THAT. I'm not being friends with retards who do that. ugh. I wish someone could drill this through peoples fucking brains."

Meet Zach who lives in Tennessee. He's sixteen. Smart, friendly, kind. Oh, and gay. There's the problem, to his parents, who have enrolled him in an indoctrination camp run by 'Christians' to turn him 'right'.

  So apparently the guys parents lied to him about the program, and he somehow got a hold of those rules, as he wasn't supposed to (as you can tell by all the ""not to be given to client""s in there. It seems that none of the clients are to know what the program is actually about until they get there, in effect, tricking/forcing them into going. I suggest you all read it... [they are very long, so you can skim and get the main idea, it's a gross violation of rights]


The best part is the rules. ""women must shave legs and underarms at least twice weekly. Bras must be worn at all times. Men are not permitted to wear jewelery."""

"event","<P>A little less ..emotional, today. I talked to&nbsp;Tim last night, who I haven't talked to in about a year, for about an hour and a half.&nbsp;Ahhh I have no sense of money whatsoever. But it was important in some odd way, and I really missed him. It was nice to talk to him again, although he's just as confusing and intense as ever. haha, Brigid just&nbsp;came bringing gifts for&nbsp;me (a box of kleenex) so she could climb&nbsp;all over me and not go watch barney like a told her to.&nbsp;what a cutie. ""tankoo avon!"" Anyways. So we talked a long time, reminded me of a lot of old things, and how things have changed.&nbsp;(except my 12 year old voice, apparently) In a&nbsp;good way. Brought up a lottttttt of old things, holy balls. I still care about that boy alot. I can't believe he's in the army.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Candyce's was really fun, martinis were absolutely&nbsp;delicious. Stayed up all night, talked to Kim a lot, was exhausted going to school the next morning. Skipped&nbsp;third and fourth, got grounded for a week. I've spent the week doing bio and essays though, so it's ok.&nbsp;Thursday night I&nbsp;stayed up all night doing essay, finished at 7am, slept all day after handing it in. </P>
<P>I got a package a week or so ago from emma :) with some pictures, a letter, some NZ coins for the kids and a necklace for me with some shells. Its really nice, I havent taken it off. </P>
<P>The party at my house was funnn, I've been rather obsessed with gravy train since. The amount of love and kissing was craxy kids. We're a very lovey group, we are. Jess and dannnn came :) I was so glad. I haven't talked to Jess in so long, it was nice.&nbsp;</P>
<P>I've been a little obsessed with BSS and Metric lately,&nbsp;jess has set the passion on fire completely. anthems for a 17 year old girl is an amazing song. Can't seem to get enough. Need less, use less, we're asking for too much I guess. lala lala la la la..</P>
<P>I hate journals where all you do is recap, but I haven't talked to anyone much week, so I guess it's necessary. I know you want me. I found some really good avatars yesterday, they make me happy. I love images. Tim always has good ones. I want to print off a few and put them up in my room. Oh, I also decorated my room. And I looked for a job yesterday, put some resume's in a few places. I need to repay my mom and start saving for my london trip (in maaaarch!) and for uni, if I get in. I wrote a new song, and kate wrote 2 guitar melodies that I am putting a tune/lyrics to. They are different, I really like them. I think all the postal service and metric I've been listening to is coming off in my music. So succexy.</P>
<P>I'm still stressed about university, still just as anxious to do well. I really hope I don't fail, or more that I do well enough to get in. So much is riding on this. I jsut want to get exams over with, and get over 75 at least on everything. I'm doing super well in english though, so thats the most important one anyways.&nbsp;I haven't gotten less then 97% on an english test so far, so I got this. I wish I could not go to england and go to NZ instead, I honestly do. I asked my parents, but they wont let me. Because they suck. I'd love to visit singapore too, and see some old friends. I miss travelling, it's like&nbsp;I lead a double life sometimes.&nbsp;It doesn't feel like it was me that's been so many places and seen so many things. It doesn't feel like it was me that lived there for 6 months,&nbsp;through all that drama and all the relationships. It is the wierdest feeling. This is turning into a long entry. It's true that everyone is so much more.. exagerrated online. You're either so depressed or so happy, and I'm sure that's really how you're feeling at the time, but if you talked to&nbsp;me in real life I'm sure I wouldn't seem so dramatic. Well, maybe, but not in a negative way. It both shows the real you and hides the real you, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

I'm sick of fighting with my parents, I'm sick of hiding everything, I'm sick of my parents being so amazing sometimes and so fucking INTOLERABLE other times, I'm sick of distance, I'm sick of school and people and my life. I don't like anything. Its boiling up inside of me and I'm about to explode. I'm sick of this town, I'm sick of this rediculous pattern that we all follow, I'm sick of unfairness and coincidence. I'm sick of snobby people and I'm sick of people who don't care about me. I'm sick of people who don't follow through with things, who make promises and plans they can't keep. I'm sick of feeling alone. I'm sick of feeling like I'm the only one who's got to be upbeat and cheerful, and strong. I'm sick of people not cheering ME up, not giving ME hugs. I'm sick of not having any money, and I'm sick of working. I'm sick of EXAMS. I'm sick of biology. I'm sick of this house and my room. I'm sick of my family. I hate being underage, I hate being judged. I'm sick of EVERY FUCKING THING I DO going wrong, and nothing ever working out. I'm sick of relationships. I'm sick of msn, I'm sick of EVERYTHING. I want to crawl into a fucking hole and die. Seriously. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. So far this new year SUCKS. I want and I need more then this. I need to be taken care of sometimes, instead of it always seeming to be the other way around. I want&nbsp;my fucking relationships to stop feeling so fucking one sided. I'm sick of this shit. I want to die. I can't wait to get OUT of this shit hole. I can't wait to never see anyone again and just freaking GO. I don't think I can last these last few months. I don't think I can handle another pretentious teacher or student. I honestly don't think it's gonna get any better either, if I try to be realistic. Its going to suck forever. I need a fucking holiday. &nbsp;"

<P>I like that song. Basically all my hopes are riding on the fact that I will get into Western, and move on. That I'll graduate, and leave, and start this new chapter in my life. I'm sick of the same things over and over again, and I know once I leave I'll miss it. But I can't help but spend my entire year with that underlying voice telling me to get out, counting down the days until I'm free. But really that's not what I'm counting down the days for. 7 months. Bleh. I miss being in&nbsp;a band. I miss YOU. I miss singing, and writing music. I miss standing on stage, with the lights and the crowd out below me. It's so amazing. I just can't seem to do it right now. My heart's not in it, because my heart isn't here. I wish I could visit over christmas, I wish I could be there right now. I wish I could be there the whole time. But until then I have to just hold on. </P>
<P>Kate and I are going to start recording again, she's changed alot and I realized once it was over how much I missed it. It feels wierd without you, but I know&nbsp;you wont mind. I'll send you what we come up with. </P>
<P>I like Harry Potter music. Other then all that other stuff, christmas break has been going alright. I've been sick through most of it, crappy cold. But it's nice to have a break, to sleep in. The snow outside is up to my waist almost on my back porch, I love itt!! Ps. That grade 10 girl, she sang that oasis song hold on. It's been in my head since she sang it. I was SO impressed by her, she's got such a stage presence. She reminds me of me kinda, grade 10 was the first time I did that too. Except she's a lot more trained, lol. Looks like I have some competition. But my god, she was so good. I'm a fan. Andrea was also amazing. There is so much talent at our school! Even Belinda did pretty well, I was shocked. I wish my mojo wasn't gone. Stupid mojo. Otherwise I'd kick everyone else's ass. </P>
<P>The Postal Service is the best band in the world right now. </P>"

 I hope things work out, but I also hope I don't get over it. I don't know. I can't explain it really right now. I can't let go just yet. I can't move on just yet. Maybe I never will."

Haven't heard that song in a while. Anyways, wow it's been such a long time since I last updated this. Praps I'll take it up again, mostly so gillian can know what's going on in my life since we hardly see each other. So.. Emma's been gone for just over a week, and I'm coping, It's hard, I still have little habits that I'm having to force myself to break. Whenever the phone rings, whenever I walk by her street, whenever I'm at the park. But I'm handling it better then I ever thought I would, and carrying on. I got my eyebrow pierced, and the cartilage in my ear done too. I'm enrolled in far too many clubs to keep me busy and out of trouble, and I'm sorting things out with everyone. The climax is over, and things are starting to die down and get back to normal again, or as normal as they're ever going to be. 8 months.. its still sinking in. I hope everything turns out alright."

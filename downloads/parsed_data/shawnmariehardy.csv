Please visit <a href=""http://www.honorwithart.com"">www.honorwithart.com</a> for complete details. The end result will be an ""altered book,"" which is similar to a scrapbook, filled with original art from artists worldwide. This piece will be auctioned and 100% of all proceeds will go to charities that advocate for missing and exploited children. <br /><br />I am looking for small, original works of art on paper, or other flat surface, that can be put into the book. Work should be no larger than 10 x 10"" and can be as small as a postage stamp, including but not limited to mixed-media works, paintings, ATC's, poetry, cds, stories, blessings, etc. <br /><br />If interested, please email - <a href=""mailto:shawnmarie1961@gmail.com"">mailto:shawnmarie1961@gmail.com</a> or phone - 517-281-9927. <br /><br /><strong><font color=""#ff9900"">Deadline for art submissions - June 2007</font></strong> <br /><br /><strong><font color=""#ff00ff""><font color=""#ccffff""><font color=""#0000ff"">Art should be sent to:</font>&nbsp;<br /></font><br />Shawn Marie Hardy, <br />Our Children: Honor With Art, <br />2260 Park Lane #2, <br />Holt, Michigan, 48842.</font></strong> <br /><br /></p>"

"event","I'm looking forward to the Bluesfest here in Old Town, Lansing tonight.  It'll probably be the last big bash here before the snow flies.  But I woke up after only 4 hours of sleep and I stayed in bed too long so I have a major caffeine headache today. And I'm tired. My daughter gave me a nice back rub and here I sit with my coffee at my side.  Until August I didn't need caffeine - I had been off of it for 2 1/2 years.  When I went to my favorite coffee shop in San Francisco I readdicted myself - it was well worth it.  

I'm trying to get a couple new pieces done this weekend - gotta start selling again."

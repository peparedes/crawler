I know you're busy, I know you're stressed, I know you've got all the same baggage and more, but that doesn't mean you can treat me like this. I'm literally physically hurting. Maybe there's just something wrong with me. Maybe I get too invested. But I wanted to make the best of these last two weeks. The fact that this has to end doesn't mean the last two weeks have to be so miserable. And if you think the answer is to just break up now, then you could at least tell me that. JUST SAY SOMETHING. PLEASE, DON'T JUST DISAPPEAR FROM MY LIFE. 

I just hope you're not going through the same pain as I am right now, that somehow this is easier on you. Because I honestly have no desire to be awake right now."

But this situation is so stupid. Why the fuck are you involved with some sketchy, greasy, lifeless alum 6 years your senior when you could be with me?

And the kind I like best are the ones that are so beautiful, so emotional, and so innocent, that they overwhelm you with poignancy, as though you were looking back at your childhood: a precious time that can never be relived, but one that will always be cherished and longed for. Some stories do it so well, I want to cry, overwhelmed as I am with those slowly fading memories, gradually ushered into darkness by the creeping shadow cast by the setting sun. In those last moments, illuminated by that soft golden-orange light, they are so beautiful, so perfect and pure. I miss the characters like old friends, and read their stories like a letter from them, one to which I can never reply, and yet one that fills me with those memories even with just the thought of it. The whole thing is brought together into that lump in your throat that makes you smile as you cry.

Memories are priceless, amazing, precious things. I hope that, when the sun sets on my own life, I'll have lived a life that, when I look back on it, moves me to tears at its beauty."

It all got laid out in the open, I know pretty much everything about the situation, and it really is a lot simpler than I thought it was. I'm totally cool with everything the way it is now. In a way, I got what I want. I really enjoy spending time with Tasha, and I probably spend more time one on one with her than any other person at Williams. We can talk about anything, are getting to know each other better, do shit together, care about each other, all that good stuff. I feel like Tasha and I are on the road to becoming very good friends. I am still attracted to her, but it's really a very general attraction, and romantic attraction is just a small part of it. I don't care if I go into the ""friend zone"", because I want us to become friends. I'm not really hoping for anything but the deepening and strengthening of our relationship, no matter what direction it happens to take.

"event","I've got enough hindsight now to think clearly about everything that's happened with Tasha. The past two months have seen me fooling myself once again into believing that a girl is interested in me. I hate to admit it, but to her, I'm probably just another Wilmer. 

I've got frustrations that I'm comfortable venting now. The way I see it, this went down one of three ways: 
Either Tasha realized I had feelings for her but was too uncomfortable with saying anything until I asked her out, which she took as an opportunity to put me down gently and respectfully, which I would prefer to be the case. At least it's all been going uphill since Junior year; everything's more open, no bullshit. But damn it, Tasha, you could've ended it the FIRST time I asked you out, instead of making me think that from Valentine's Day on, we were testing the waters. 
Or it may have been the case that she realized I had feelings for her and decided to exploit them. It's nice to feel liked, and it's also nice to get chocolates, flowers, dinner, someone who will neglect their homework to spend time with you, someone who will stay up till 4 in the morning with you, someone who will go to the snack bar at 1 in the morning and hold onto the food for you till you get out of Sweeney Todd since you haven't eaten since lunch. All you'd have to do is put up the mild illusion that you're interested in him, and you get all these benefits for the cost of nothing but a little awkwardness. That would make Tasha a deceptive bitch, and I'm pretty sure she isn't, but it's a possibility that's nagging at me. 
Finally, she could never have realized I had feelings for her, and have been totally surprised BOTH times I asked her out. And that wouldn't make any sense, how dense can you get? 

The common frustration in all three scenarios is that I got led on, big time. For the past two months, we've been a part of each other's lives. I've spent more time with you than I have with Johannes. You meant something special to me, and if there was a day when I didn't see you, I would feel all torn up inside. And the whole time, what was I? Just a good friend?

I don't even know what's so attractive about you. I wish I could stop liking you, and it makes sense for me to move on now. This is in no way one of the blown out of proportion situations I got myself into in high school, where I took months to get over somebody. And yet I'm still drawn to you. On second thought, I know why I'm still attached, it's because of your damn charm that makes me think I still have a chance. It might be largely my own fault, I could just be wired to interpret it all this way, but you still make it seem like you like me. I've gotta have something to interpret. 

I guess this is preferable to you giving me the cold shoulder. But I guess I'm learning from this that us staying as close as we were isn't going to work out so well, either. Because, fuck, as close as we were for the past two months basically means that we're going out. Everyone saw it that way. Can't live with em', can't live without em', what the hell am I supposed to do? 

Graaaah. Let's take a look at what you said to me. You just got out of a relationship, so you're not really looking for anyone right now, you didn't mean to mislead me, you should've said something else on Valentine's Day, you're a really nice guy, this has nothing to do with you, blah blah blah. There's evidence for all three scenarios in there, but they all contradict each other nicely, which means I don't know what the fuck to think, and that statement leaves me with no helpful framework for interpreting the current situation. Am I supposed to wait until you feel ready, is there any chance at all, or should I just give up? I really wish I could read your mind. 

I don't miss you. It's been about a week since I last saw you, but there's none of that internal conflict that I'd get last month. I mostly feel nothing, because I don't know what to feel. Actually, right now, I feel kind of pissed. I think, if I let everything go, my most natural reaction to this situation is anger. Fuck you for making me think there was something between us. Fuck you. You gave me two of the best months of my time at Williams and then revealed, haha, it was all a big joke. Fuck you for playing with my heart. 

Thankfully, I'm not an irrational person, I think, and I can pass off that anger as nonsense. Really, we are good friends, and I value the time we spend together for the past two months, and I'm looking forward to expanding our friendship. That all coexists with the confusion and frustration, which has its foundation in that irrational anger. I do think it's necessary to vent anger like that from time to time, though. 

If I can be allowed one other irrational sentiment, it's the hope that someday, you'll realize that we should be together, because there's no denying that I still have feelings for you."

"event","I was looking through my old xanga. The first thing that struck me on that were the fucking NUMBERS. Entries from 2004? 2005? I can't believe that much time has passed. Looking at the content of my entries, though, makes me realize just how much has happened. I was bad at DDR...Lisa commented me...I was applying to college...I was really freaking emo. In lots of ways, I feel like I've grown a lot since then. I fucking hope I've grown since then <_< 

But at the same time, I feel like I'm still the same in some fundamental ways. It kinda frustrates me. It makes me feel like I don't have a really strong sense of self. Right now, when I try to define myself, it's hard. I listen to metal. I play DDR. I'm a college student. I can't think of shit! What the hell else? I don't write anymore, I barely play videogames or watch anime, I don't play any sports...What is it that defines what a person is? I feel like, if I can't start to answer these questions soon, how can I or anyone else respect or love me? I have to become a real person, or else I won't really matter. There's so much I wish I could be doing, but I waste my time on so much pointless shit. Damn it, I want to be someone. 

Anyway, I think what I noticed in my xanga is how empty a person I was back then. Yeah. And that's why I'm thinking about all this now. 

It's so hard to think of shit. I don't even feel like I have a real home right now. My family is in FL, my friends and my memories are in NYC, and my future is in Williamstown. What is my purpose? I've been clinging to this since 2005, apparently: to make people happy. To be strong enough to help people from their depression, their despair, their own sense of emptiness. That has sort of refined into my pursuit of clinical psychology, and I do have genuine interest in the field. But it's a tough dream to fulfill, filling the emptiness in people's lives, when I myself and empty. What do I fill anyone with? 

I think I want to start writing again. But I've also recently started playing the guitar. A little bit. Still, though...Even if I played the guitar and finished my novel and played varsity basketball, would that define me? 

I let myself too often be defined by one girl or the other throughout high school. I was pretty pathetic, looking back at it. I'm trying hard to break free from that. 

Hmm...It's such a tough question. But the more I think about it, the closer I feel like I'm arriving at an answer. 

Existentialism is sort of neat. I don't like those who emphasize the nihilistic aspects of the philosophy, because I believe existentialism's main point is positive and uplifting: embrace life, embrace your existence for its own sake, and create your own meaning. I used to wish there was a meaning to life, and I've believed in so many things, but I think this is really the best answer. I think this allows us to put our faith into whatever the hell they want. I know my beliefs, at least, I know what I'm committed to, and what I will speak out for and against, and that must be a crucial part of my self. And I guess these next four years are supposed to be devoted to me discovering who I really am, right? 

Mmm...I can't believe how bad my procrastination has gotten. I'm going to stop this ranting and start my homework."

I've been hanging out with her every day since last Thursday, and on the weekend, it was till 5 or 4 in the morning. I ordered two candygrams for her, and I'm going to get her flowers too. And maybe write a separate valentine for her mailbox. I really like her. 

I'm probably going to have to not hang out with her tomorrow, though. Grargh, I have to do a couple of papers. Shit, I really hope that Psych paper wasn't mandatory. 

I mean, I really like hanging out with her and all, but something's gotta give if I spend that time with her. Last week, it was sleep, but I can't go on like that. So today and yesterday, it was schoolwork. And that's not my style. College is hard. >____< I'm going to have to buckle down and get shit done tomorrow. 

Still, I've gotten so used to hanging out with her. It feels so natural now. I think I've finally found the right person. 

In other news, Yoyo is getting more and more depressed. I'm worried. He was quite clearly clinical this evening. Downright clinically depressed. I wouldn't say he's bipolar, since he never goes manic, but he might have minor depressive disorder, or maybe seasonal affective disorder, or something. Whatever the case, he's starting to show symptoms of shit, and I feel powerless to help him. A lot of shit is falling apart lately, actually. My shoes are trash, I have an open cavity, my glasses broke, Veronica's grandpa died, my family is in no better a situation than it's been for the past few months, and I lack any real motivation in life. Sometimes I feel the same way Yoyo does, but I can't let it get to me, because I'm the only one who can help him when he needs it the most. 

I just finished reading Norwegian Wood by Murakami Haruki. It was an excellent book. 

Hmmm. I hope Yoyo feels better soon. 

I feel really shallow and selfish sometimes. Sure, there's all this shit to deal with, but I'm living too much in the present, not thinking enough about the future. I need to grow up, and start planning ahead. I was in control last semester! I need to find a job for this summer, and get that 4.0 this semester. I need to learn how to help people deal with sadness, and reaffirm for myself the ground of my optimistic nature, and to try and catch a glimpse of an inkling of the meaning and beauty of life. That's what I really need to do right now. 

But if I think about what I want right now, it's to go and edit the stupid messages on Tasha's candygrams. Hmm. And, actually, to get my work done. So there's some harmony in there. In any case, the number one want and need on my list right now is sleep. I should write more entries in the middle of the day, they will probably make more sense than this one does."

At least I'm learning? T___T 

Valentine's Day is coming up. Oho. I am going to buy a carnation, and decide by then whether it's going to Tasha, Rebecca, or Elisa. Who knows, maybe some fourth candidate will magically appear tomorrow, and we'll fall in love and I'll forget all about these three. Leslie tells me that a good deal of relationship success just rests on dumb luck, that coincidences and situations sort of just come together and make them just ""happen"". It's simultaneously comforting and discouraging. 

Right now, though, my gut instinct is Tasha. I suppose certainty is a good sign. I have to try and be more decisive in general. It almost worked with Elisa! 8D 

I want to learn to play guitar. Like, for serious. And I have a friend who can play Dragonforce, so I definitely have someone to teach me. If I ever magically find time this semester, it's on. I'll be cranking out Galneryus by the summer, buy my own shit (because lefty equipment is apparently mad cheap), and practice while I'm in Florida. 

I can't write anything coherent right now =_=. I'm looking forward to reading Norwegian Wood, because Murakami is good, and Andy actually likes it. Andy doesn't like anything, so this is of great significance. 

Top 3 things I want to do right now:
Play Starcraft
Play DDR
Have an engaging, playful conversation with Tasha on a couch or something (that would probably exceed the current limits of our social compatibility, but nonetheless, in theory this would be awesome) that makes us realize we're perfect for each other and we enter into an adorable, mutually supportive and constructive relationship, during the course of which we exchange many hand-made gifts.

I dunno if I'll work for four hours on Wednesdays, though, because I might need that time to do reading and whatnot. As in I will definitely need that time to do reading and whatnot. Sometimes I wonder why I go to the gym. Muscle is healthier, and it is satisfying to get stronger, and I want to improve my definition so I look better...Hm. I dunno, it feels kind of empty in a way. I feel like I should do a lot more cardio, like maybe go running. I'm probably doing that MWF, before math. Which should work out. The question is, running, or DDR? It's a very difficult choice. 

So yeah. Back on campus. Life has resumed. A new semester. I'm going to go to more parties this semester, to decide once and for all if they're worth going to.

"event","So I'm sitting in Ly's dorm room, just browsing around on the internet. Dead Week, a short vacation that fits between our Winter semester and Spring Semester, has been pretty enjoyable so far. I've been in New York since Friday and have had a surprising amount of things to do. I went to Carlos's house on Saturday and chilled with him and Felix for a while, then met up with Janine-tachi in Toys R Us to play some DDR. After that, I headed down to Union Square to meet up with Ly, Angela, and Chui in Barnes and Nobles, and we sort of just chilled the rest of the night away. Oh, and I got to see Mark high, that was pretty amusing. 

Janine got kicked out of her house and out of college. It's pretty crazy to have both happen at the same time, even if one was the inevitable result of the other. I felt so bad for her, but she was just the same old Janine the whole time. She was cheery and optimistic about it, but down to earth about what she needed to get done. I feel like there's a lot more to her than meets the eye. She's really small and innocent for her age, it seems, but I get the feeling that she's seen a lot in her lifetime, and she has a lot of inner strength. Her ability to handle this in this way is really impressive. Even one of the strongest people I know couldn't handle being disowned nearly as well as Janine did. I'm not discrediting her at all, though, I'm just amazed at how Janine is dealing with this. I really hope it is because of some inner strength of hers, and not because she's either ignoring the harshness of reality or is just naively oblivious to it. 

I feel like Janine, Anthony, and all of them are such good friends because they're the closest to my own life situation. Almost all of my friends are unavoidably better off than I am in terms of family and financial situation. But I get the feeling that those guys are down there with me. It's why I was able to connect with Mike and William so easily, too, I think. It's obviously not a limiting or controlling factor in any way, otherwise I wouldn't be friends with Andy, who is super rich. But it helps. It increases empathy. I want to hold on to this group of friends. They're all such good people. My DDR crew. I met them a month before I moved away from New York City, because Johannes had a crush on one of them. Really, our friendship formed around Johannes and Eric's relationship. But our friendship was surprisingly strong and quick to grow. Hmmm. Yeah, they're pretty awesome. 

It's also awesome to be staying with Ly. I love Ly. I admire her. She's really an incredible person. She's taking 18 credits (6 classes), working two jobs, and volunteering at god knows how many other things. Every day, I learn a little bit more about her, and understand a little bit more just how much she's seen, how much she's been through and experienced, and how much she knows. She's just so full of strength and determination. I'm surprised that she hasn't been hardened by all the shit that's happened to her; she remains one of the friendliest people I know, one of the kindest, most empathetic, considerate people I know. Her life feels like it's been so rich so far, and yet her unique character is going to enable her to get even more out of life. I feel like this is nothing but a general list of superlatives that describe any ""good"" person, but it really does apply to Ly. She truly is a good person. One of my favorites. I want her to be happy forever >__<

On Sunday, I visited Manor Community Church. Pastor Little suffered from cardiac arrest that morning, and we don't know what kind of condition she's in now. Gah, I seem to know way too many strong women. Well, I won't go into it, but Pastor Little is definitely a fighter, probably ranking up there next to Ly. But she's like, 87 now. This is the first time that she's said she's ready to die, in the last couple of years in which she's had several close calls. She said that she's ready to go. I still don't know where I stand on the whole Christianity thing. I feel like I'm choosing Deism out of laziness and convenience, and because I have other things to worry about right now. But putting myself in her frame of mind, if it's her God's will to take her, let Him take her gently, because she deserves a break. 

Pastor Chris took me out to lunch after mass. He keeps telling the same old stories about his experience with immigration, but I still like to hear them. He's really awesome...I hope Pastor Little's death, if it ends up going that way, doesn't hit him too hard. Manor Community Church's future is in his hands, now. But Chris still has a lot of time ahead of him...I think it'll be okay. 

After that, I met up with Charlie's Angels/The Three Stooges/Tasha, Rebecca, and Sough-Hee, and Tasha's friend Devin, to go to karaoke for one hour. Devin had a plane to catch. It was fun, I suppose, but the machine was being dumb, and Duet 35 totally fucking butchered ""Libra"". I mean, it was my first time singing it, so I was pretty bad, but the synth just ruined the uplifting atmosphere of the song, so I skipped it right after the first chorus. CURSE YOU, FAKE MIDI SHIT-MUSIC!!!

We went to korean barbecue downtown afterwards. It was yummy and fun. I am hanging out with those three a lot more now, and it makes me glad. Hahaha, I guess it reminds me of home, hanging out with a bunch of asian girls? 8D But we're all like-minded in one way or another. All of us don't drink, Seohee and Rebecca are into Japanesey things of all sorts, Rebecca listens to metal, Tasha is really optimistic and loves singing and plays and movies and shit like that, I dunno. They're a lot less intimidating than a lot of the people at Williams, plus they go to DDR club. I'm glad we're becoming better friends. It would be a lot easier on me if I could decide whether or not I have feelings for Rebecca, though. <___> 

...Or Tasha! BLAEERGGHH! I miss high school, when I would like someone so much, they would be all I thought about. I miss that clarity, that decisiveness! Now I almost have to decide whether or not I actually like the person. I haven't really ""felt"" it for a long time. Except for with Veronica, but that's definitely not a subject that eases my mind. 

We hung out in SoHo for a while afterwards. The following day, I went to play some DDR by myself before meeting with them in the theatre district to try our hand at the Rent lottery, to get FRONT ROW, SPIT-RANGE SEATS FOR TWENTY DOLLARS. Only Tasha and I wanted to watch it, but all four of us entered to up our chances. Rebecca won it! Ahhh, me and Tasha were so excited. We got the tickets, then went to dinner at Cafe Metro, then, Tasha and I headed off to see Rent. Yeah, just Tasha and me. It was pretty uneventful, but the atmosphere definitely existed in my head. I didn't know what she thought of it, though, so I decided not to make any moves. BECAUSE THAT STRATEGY HAS WORKED FOR ME SO MANY TIMES IN THE PAST LOLOLOLOL

But it was pretty cute regardless. Rent was pretty amazing. Well, not amazing. It was pretty awesome. Tasha seemed to really enjoy it. Why is she so cute. ._. 

I headed back to the dorms afterwards and chilled with Ly and some of her friends for a while. There are too many Bx Sci people in Hunter. @_@ 

This brings us to the present. I have two days of vacation left. Classes start thursday. I have been inspired by Ly to try and take five classes this semester in addition to working at the Youth Center. My schedule will be pretty beastly, but not as beastly as Ly's is. I figure, why the hell not? If I can do it, I should do it, it'll only make me stronger in the long run. If I can't get all my books, or it turns out to be way to much for me to handle. I'll just drop a class, simple as that. But I'm going for it the first two weeks. It should be a very interesting challenge. I'm also going to start doing more cardio next semester, to get rid of these last vestiges of bodyfat, in order to make my true muscular build shine forth in all its glory! For rizzle, my arms are lot better than they look ;~; I guess I'm a little vain, but I haven't been going to the gym every day for the past 4 or 5 months for nothing. Once I start eating less (I am eating meat at only one meal a day from now on) and running more, I'll get the body I DESERVE! Because I have put in the work, I just need to put in a liiiitttttlle bit more. 

Lulz to the Love It milkshake I had at Cold Stone yesterday XDD I AM A WALKING MASS OF CONTRADICTIONS

Can't wait to get back on campus. I am hanging out with Ellen in less than an hour and a half. I sort of don't feel like it anymore, but I won't go back on my word. .-. Besides, I have nothing else to do today.

"event","One of the things I like a lot about Williamstown is the view of the night sky. It's way in the middle of nowhere, so the only ambient lights are the few streetlights and the lights coming from inside the handful of buildings-not nearly enough to obscure the stars. Last night especially was a really clear, beautiful night. I'm pretty sure I saw the North Star, or maybe Alpha Centauri, because it was the absolute brightest star I'd ever seen. It was amazing, and I'm not just using that word, I walked the distance from Elisa's room, up the hill, and to my dorm with my neck craned, looking up at that star. I also got the chance to see Orion's belt, which I see every night, and what I'm pretty sure was a planet, because it was a yellow star. It was seriously this dusty golden/yellow color, and it had a sort of softer glow than the other stars. None of this compares to when we were on Stone Hill in the beginning of the year, and I saw the Big Dipper...That was fucking intense. I want to go back there some day, which is a big reason behind why I want to be a Bridges facilitator. There's something really awe-inspiring about being able to see the stars in the night sky. I guess it's just because I grew up without being able to see them. But still...there's this inherent majesty and beauty to them that I'm never going to grow out of. 

Also, I found a PV for Libra by MUCC with a subbed translation, and the song became like twice as awesome. The PV and knowledge of the lyrics both illustrate the song so well, it's like Tatsurou's existential crisis as the angel and devil on his shoulder debate the meaning of life, and how Tatsurou holds on to his love to get him through it. It's probably one of my favorite MUCC songs. It really sums up MUCC's story since their dark days to stuff like Utagoe. I'm looking forward very much to their new album. Flight and Fuzz are pretty good, but with stuff like Libra on it, they're bound to secure themselves even more tightly as my favorite band.

"event","I have decided to start posting in this livejournal again. I haven't blogged one bit since perhaps the middle of last summer, so I sort of feel the need to do so. I dunno, maybe it would've helped me sort through a lot of the stress I faced last semester. I don't feel like clogging this entry up with shit that's already happened, though, so I'm just going to focus on the now. 

Of course, the shit that prompted me to post here at all is what it usually is. I'm here to produce semi-emo ramblings about a girl. Because that's what ""the now"" is for me. I haven't stopped thinking about her since Friday night. I keep wanting to know exactly what the situation is between us, cursing my memory for not being able to perfectly recall what happened in that restaurant, what she said exactly. I want to know how she feels, and I want her to know with the clarity I desire how I feel. She knows that I like her, but I don't think she understands. And I am pretty much in the same boat. I keep wondering what she really meant when she said ""I really like you"". Why is it only ""right now"" that she's ""not interested""? I wish we could read each others' minds, but even then, I'm not sure if I'll like what I find.

I said that I was happy with how things turned out, and I'm pretty sure I am. I know that we are much closer now, and I feel like both of us want to get to know the other better. Both of us said it. I am happy with how things are. But I know I could be happier, and in that disparity lies a distinct dissatisfaction. Just knowing that we want to get to know each other better isn't enough.

I feel an emptiness that exists just outside my body, right in front of my chest. I feel like Elisa would fit perfectly in that gap. I just want to be with her right now. I want to embrace her. Sometimes I wish I were socially ignorant so that I would just be able to go to her without worrying about spending too much time with her, or seeming awkward. I probably am socially retarded to begin with, though, and maybe that's why I feel so restricted. 

Graaaaahhhhhhh. If I don't call her tonight, I'll just have to wait till ice skating tomorrow.

"event","What an awesome day. It was just chock full of stuff. 8D I went grocery shopping with my mom first thing in the morning, which is an instant win, especially since I got a muffin. Then I went home and bummed around for a while, playing some games, etc. I did my workout, showered, played some wii, which I heart, then went off with Yoyo to Toys R Us to go play DDR. After a bit of walking around, we met up with Eric, Janine, and that whole crew, and we played DDR for a few hours. It was lots of fun, although I didn't achieve any milestones this week (I actually did worse than usual 8D). This was the second to last time I'll play DDR in New York, I believe. Unless I get bored during one of the next couple of days. But yeah, my time's running out. I've got exactly two weeks left.

Two weeks left. Fourteen days until the 30th, when I move away to Florida. It seems like such a small number, and it really is. It's terrifying, really. It hasn't sunk in yet, which sucks even more-it'll sink in ten days from now, when I only have four days to go. It looks like the curse is still on me: I haven't lived anywhere for more than five years yet. And it's already been confirmed that the curse will continue on through college, since I'm moving back to NYC after I graduate. So I'm still a drifter. But this is going to be the worst move of them all. I'm really leaving behind some treasures here in NYC. The friends I've made are the best I've ever had. The city itself is amazing. And I've grown so much in my time here, but I was only getting started-given another year, I would've grown even more than in the four previous years. I don't want to move, but I'm already resigned to that. So all I can do now is make these two weeks the best two weeks possible.

High school is over. That hasn't sunk in yet, either. Life isn't really divided so much into stages for me anymore-it's all gradual. Time is all I measure my life with. High school was great. It was awesome, really. Like lots of things, it could've been better, but the good parts were amazing, and the bad parts are over with. I made a lot of new friends this senior year, and I'm really getting closer to defining who I am. A lot of the friends I made this year got to see the prototype of the real Joshua Wilson, the person I want to be, so I feel a bit more attached to them, even though I've only known some of them for a year. My experiences this year weren't completely harmless. One person in particular hurt me pretty badly. It won't really matter in the short term, and it'll be forgotten in time, but the pain will always linger. But I'm going to hold on to the good memories we had. I'm going to remember them the way I saw them, no matter how you see them. And I don't care if you forget about me, anymore, because the friend that I had in you did make a difference, and I have some good memories with her. Whoever that person was, whether or not it was the real you, or just some lie you created to put up with me, she was an awesome friend, and a wonderful person, and I'll always remember her.

But yeah. Emoness aside, I had some good times, and made some amazing new friends, while strengthening some old ones. Thanks so much, guys, for putting up with me. I know I'm a little bit weird and immature sometimes, but I'm really working on it. And you were awesome. You were all such good people. Beyond all my silly obsessions, it's really you guys that made me happy-not pancakes and karaoke. I wouldn't go alone to an IHOP and eat pancakes by myself. You are what makes me happy. You are all why I smile so wide in pictures, and why I try so hard to make everything work out. You guys are what made my time in New York worthwhile, and you're all what I'm going to miss the most. I don't know what we're going to do, or when, but we have to do something, at least one thing, before I move.

Hmmm. Kay I ran out of things to say. 8D

Here's to the start of an awesome summer."

"event","Prom was good. Not great, definitely not amazing, but not disappointing, either. I expected it to be about as good as it was, which is just plain good. I had a lot of fun, but I've had more fun at karaoke. It was really awesome to be in a tux, and thanks to all the people who told me I looked good. Everybody did look amazing, which caught me by surprise. I mean, people looked way better than I thought they would. Except Tinna. =P

The food was decent, but not what I prefer. The music was mostly background noise, and something to dance to, I suppose. It was my first time at a dance that I would actually publicly claim to having danced. I was moving to the music, yo. Me and Bert had to sit down and discuss it, both having come to the realization that dancing was a necessary skill that we both lacked. So I just tried to lose myself, thought about DDR some, and with some encouragement from Pauline, I learned how to ""dance"". Lol, thinking about DDR really did help me. It's weird. It gave me an ear for rhythm. Of course, I danced horribly. I did manage to dance with every single girl I'd planned on dancing with, more or less, but none of them really had much of an interest in dancing with me. 8D But it was cool. Experience breeds confidence, or whatever.

I seriously regret not doing anything afterwards, but my mom wanted me home, and I was kind of sick from jumping around, so whatever. My favorite part of prom was dancing the last couple of songs with Bert, Ly, Mark, Chui, and Mike. It was just so much fun. =D All in all, a fine evening, but like I said, karaoke and Krishna's house tends to be more fun. Even 4th period can be more fun.

Today, I played DDR with Yoyo and (gasp) Eric and Janine. It's a bit late to be establishing a new DDR group, but yeah, we were all there. I finally beat one of the infamous Supernova ten footers, Xepher, on Oni, with a B. Not too proud of it, since I flailed a little bit, but it gives me something to build off of. We chilled with Eric and Niny for a while, then Niny had to go to her family BBQ. Me, Yoyo, and Eric went down to Barnes and Nobles, where I showed them the book ""I, Lucifer"", which looks really awesome. It's basically a stream of consciousness from Satan's POV, and it's really witty and funny, and extremely interesting if you've ever thought about heaven and hell and all that good stuff. I guess it's a bit more interesting if you have something of a Christian background, but that doesn't mean non-Christians are excluded. The wit is just so awesome. I hope the real Satan is as witty as Glen Duncan. XD

I hate the fact that I am moving in exactly 3 weeks. I'm making new friends T__T The summer would have been awesome! And prom really made me want to start putting myself out there more, socially, especially in terms of getting a freaking girlfriend. But 3 weeks isn't enough time. I guess I'll have a fling in Florida. .-. Really, I think I'll be capable of it. The glaring problem with me is insecurity, and I'll be able to get over that soon.

Only a few days of school left. Whatever. I'm going to eat with Pastor Chris tomorrow, in NJ. Monday is Senior Awards, then Yoyo's award for some writing contest, Tuesday is Yoyo's senior awards, then Wednesday is graduation rehearsal. I'm selling more shirts Monday and Tuesday, and this money is actually going in my pocket, more or less >=D

I hope that the little time I have left is filled with awesome. Which shouldn't be hard, since my grandma bought 5 things of rice pudding today. =D Also, I think I'm going to Duet for the last time this Wednesday. It's not that likely that I won't go again, but just in case, everyone is invited. Thank you, and good night."

An acute overdose of caffeine, usually in excess of 250 milligrams (more than 2-3 cups of brewed coffee), can result in a state of central nervous system overstimulation called caffeine intoxication. The symptoms of caffeine intoxication may include restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation.[45][48]

I would've enjoyed today a lot more if I weren't slowly descending into another bad cold. Because of it, I was pretty tired and dulled by the entire day, and I hate feeling that way. I think it drags everything else down with it. If I seemed dead or uninterested today, sorry. I just didn't feel too good.

For those that didn't see me, I went for the ""just woke up"" costume. I put my hair up, and pictures are on facebook. It was pretty awesome 8D I got comments ranging from ""You're disgusting"" to ""You should do your hair like that every day."" I had a lot of fun today, despite the fact that it could've been better. Some of the best costumes I've seen in my four years, and the cafeteria looked pretty good, too. Mr Dobbs totally burned me in 8th period, though. He even commented on my legs; apparently they're pale. Darah thinks so too. Screw you guys >_>

I was supposed to have work today, but their other computer is broken. So I ended up nearly putting myself to sleep by reading my psychology textbook for like 40 minutes. And now I'm here. My throat is killing me, but like I said, cake is on the way, so it's not so bad.

I'm tired of high school. I know that, once I leave Bronx Science behind, I can become myself more fully than I've ever been. There's something about being there that makes me quiet and unsure of myself. I dunno, though. Maybe i'm just more outgoing in City Scholars just because. But then again, when I'm hanging out with people outside of the school, I act differently, too. Bweh. I'm just a mass of indecision. That's the biggest problem with me, I'm unsure of nothing. ""I don't know"" is my most popular phrase these days.

Shit, I was about to start this paragraph with ""I don't know."" Aghhhh. I don't want to drift away from everyone, but at the same time, I want to leave this part of my life behind. I want life to be perfect. It's too hard to please me. I'm whining. I have this weird notion that I'll suddenly have a lot of money when I'm in college. It probably coincides with the fact that i'll be away from my mom, and I am getting my inheritance, but it still doesn't add up. I wish we had money. I'm rambling.

My metabolism has become beast lately. I still have a lot to go, but I've lost a good deal of weight since last year, but it's nowhere near the amount I lost between Sophomore and Junior year. I wish the periods in weight training were longer, so I could get more exercise.

I'm a Questbridge finalist, whatever that means. All I do know is that it's made the next two weeks into a living hell for me. If my family can survive past December, I'll be surprised.

My college list:
Columbia (Questbridge)
CUNY Honors
Binghamton
Fordham

Pretty small. Life in general sucks around now. Everything sucks. Yeah, everything. I think i'm actually suffering psychosomatic effects of stress right now, because my heart/upper torso is just hurting randomly. It's just in pain, and it's been that way for hours. I could talk about how great City Scholars was, but was it really? DDR was my only true joy today. The rest of the day was just me realizing how bad I've got it, and how everything's coming apart and that my future is in jeopardy because of my own carelessness.

I bought Mark the SHSAT review book with my own money. If he doesn't study from it, I swear I'll kill him. I really hope he gets into Bronx Science. That would be nice. I also hope I get into Columbia with Questbridge, or that I'm able to get my ED app for CUNY Honors changed to a regular decision, and that I can get in, because I won't get a full ride for Fordham or Binghamton.

So much time has been wasted already, so much time is still being wasted. There's not one area of my life that I'm secure in right now. AP's, College, my family, the apartment, myself, the people around me. I don't even know what I want to do for the senior poster. GOD MY CHEST HURTS.

This is a cry for attention and pity. I'm part emo, actually. God, I feel like cursing. But even if attention and pity is denied me, I'll still keep going. No matter how pessimistic this post sounds, it's all a matter of fleeting discomfort. And when it's all over, I'll look back on it and marvel at how far I've come. But right now, in the belly of the beast, I'm fucking miserable.

Ms. Villani makes a 50 the highest grade you can get if you hand in your lab late, and since her lab conditions are so fucked up to begin with, the most I can see myself getting on the report is a B anyway, so I'm staying up for the first time until about 3 to finish it. And I'm not saving up for an iPod anymore. My mom has to keep up with credit card payments for me sending my SAT scores to all the colleges I'm applying to, BECAUSE FUCKING COLLEGEBOARD IS FUCKED UP, so I'm going to use my money for groceries throughout November. If I don't get my fee waived for the CSS profile reports, I'll cry. That's about 160 bucks that Yoyo and I don't have.

My chest still hurts. It's going to hurt long into the night, I bet.

I want to go to Harvest Buffet during Christmas break. Who wants to come? =) My hands are trembling."

I dunno how I feel about senior year anymore. I think that the workload I'm going to have from 4 APs will be a lot lighter than it's been made out to be. As long as I have the right people in my classes, it'll be all good. It's the end of senior year that I'm going to have problems with.

The new date for my birthday is next friday, afterschool.

I had hot chocolate just now. =D I make it with lots of milk and chocolate syrup, too, so it tastes good. And we have like 8 boxes of cereal and instant oatmeal to last me for the first month or so of school breakfasts. I love having food. ^_^

That's it, really. o_o I might play DDR tomorrow.

EDIT
My writing quality has declined so much. I was reading a lot of my old RP stuff (basically a bunch of collaborative fiction) from the only one we ever completed, and it was great compared to the current chapter of Kwest, in my opinion. Kwest has great potential, but the fact that its origins were so loosely founded and that I've been dragging it on for four years without any of the sheer volume to show for it must mean something. I crave something fresh >_> But as I am now, the only thing I'd be able or willing to write is School Rumble fanfiction...god help me."

"event","My first weekend without worrying about a lab report. I tell you, it was good. It passed by in a blur, really, since I was out for most of it, but it was fun. Saturday me, Yoyo, Carlos, and Nick all went to Johnny's house and played fighting games all day. That's right. Mostly 2-D fighters. In fact, I think all we played were Capcom 2-D fighters...Oh, and Smash, but what's remarkable about five gamer friends playing Smash together? I dominated, naturally. In everything. Because I'm that cool.

So, there's this new anime I've been watching. School Rumble. It's cool. I highly reccomend it. Wish I could be more eloquent. I feel like being taciturn tonight. Kay. Probably wasted all my writing fuel on Chapter 18 of Kwest last night.

This summer has brought out my inner dork. I've been pretty much just playing video games and watching anime on most of my free days. This is why I wish I could hang out with people more often. >_< Anyway, yeah. I don't have much else to say. Good night."

"event","Toward the end of college now, me, Lisa, and the other group member for our poster, Guarav (sp?) were really scrambling to get the poster done. We had to scrape together some money on the second to last day to buy stuff to make our poster with as well as print out the stuff it was going to take to print it all. But after an arduous process of buying id cards with which we could access printing stations and running around the whole college, we found out the hard way that the printers didn't have color. In the process, Guarav had lent me five bucks to buy construction paper, and I left without giving it back to him.

On the last day I approached him to give back the five, but he told me I could keep it because he'd won over a hundred dollars in poker the previous day afterschool. I was really surprised and grateful for it. Needless to say, I was terribly guilt-ridden this morning when I realized I'd forgotten to send him this lab report that he'd needed on the last day, so that it wouldn't be handed in late. I FORGOT TO SEND IT TO HIM >___<

Me: *opens refrigerator in preparation for lunch. thought crosses his mind*

I went to the pokemon center/nintendo world with my mom, Yoyo, and Ging today. It was mostly just Ging playing random Mario games, though. I showed off a little on the DDR Mario game, but it was way too easy, it made me cry. =( And I got my first taste of Resident Evil 4, and now I really want to get it (especially after Fatal Frame 2 is leaving me wanting...)

On the way home, I had a lot of fun. I was just commenting on various yummy foods we'd pass by and such. I had some ice cream and an M-azing bar, and I listened to some Arch Enemy. It was all good. =D I'm in a really good mood.

Too bad school starts in two and a half weeks T___T On the plus side, birthday plans are solidifying in my head..

It started out with her and my grandma talking about the church and Pastor Chris in general, basically just criticizing and being hypocrites and what not. It got on my nerves, so I entered a bad mood for the evening. Then, my mom starts talking to me about the money I'm inheriting when I turn 18 and what I'm going to do with it and whatever...She was being very closed-minded and a whole bunch of shit that I didn't really like. She has no faith in me, and I dunno why. I can't remember fully what the conversation was about, but it didn't end very well. I cried a lot after I went to my room, but I feel better now. Still...I don't know. I don't often have things like this happen, and I don't want them to.

I was being a bit disrespectful, but she was doing the same. Nobody seems to respect my position in this house. I can't say I do much, but when my mom's here, I'm in charge. She thinks I'm still a little kid, and it pisses me off sometimes. Bah, whatever @_@"

This was a nice, relaxing weekend. College NOW is almost over, just two more weeks. It's crazy. I have to start working on my final project soon, but otherwise, it's all good. It's going to be a good two weeks. Then, school's just around the corner, along with four AP classes. My heart, it is breaking.

In Flames is one of my new favorite bands. Melodic Death Metal at its finest ;_; If it sounds interesting at all, you can ask me for song reccomendations. But it probably doesn't sound interesting. If I can find out how, I'll put one of their instrumentals on my xanga. Now that I have DSL. 8D

I'm loathing my lack of income. It was all smooth sailing until my bosses just suddenly stopped giving me work. Now I have no money in my wallet, ever. It sucks hard. The free food at Hunter is the only thing that keeps me going-with the vouchers, I can get two pieces of fruit and a pastry at lunch for just a few extra cents. Oh yeah. 8D Otherwise, I have no money to buy anything, and I'm in desperate need of new headphones. I've contemplated stealing some from Hunter's bookstore one too many times >_>

I want City Scholars to start again, too.

So, today, on the lunch line, David, this very annoying guy in my class who is destined to either be shot by an extremely frustrated teacher, or become one of the corniest and yet most effective professors of chemistry in the city, should he make it that far. Basically, he's a chem nerd. And he's actually damn proud of it. Couple this with the rest of his personality, and you get a ""super nerd"".

So, he's talking to some kids from Tech on the lunch line and eventually starts making fun of gamers for being ""Super Nerds"", then goes on to say ""Hey, do any of you guys watch Sci-Fi (the channel), by any chance? There's this new show with this, uh...This Super Physicist or something...""

I am a hypocrite, but this guy are sick. I won't deny any claims at me being a nerd, but to blindly mock people of being ""super nerds"" without even giving yourself any consideration at all, especially judging from how people treat you (his sister is in our class, and she's decidedly less nerdy than him, despite my severe aversion to her blatant cruelty and all the rest of it [Yeah, people are defined by my opinions and observations]) is just more evidence of your own arrogance. Wow, what a needlessly long and complex sentence. I blame it on the lab reports.

In short, he's a stupid newbie.

But I don't really mind him that much, either. This is just me observing again; I'm not really angry or anything at all. I was laughing as I pointed it out, in fact. The moral of the story is, I need a considerably higher amount of tact and humility than the amount I currently possess. =D 

I sound pretty arrogant and hypocritical, don't I? Still, I think one of the most important parts of living is self-acknowledgement and self-criticism. The fact that I consciously acknowledge my own shortcomings makes them seem somewhat less harsh. Or something. Maybe it doesn't. Who cares, at this point? I really just felt like typing something for no reason. I'm going to take the rest of the night easy.

I arrived at Flushing library a half hour early and sat and chilled with Yoyo for a while, listening to the Zen. Christina (sp?) ran into us, that girl from karaoke/the despairs ray concerts. Jessie's cousin, I'm pretty sure. She's cool. She sat and talked with us for a while, then had classes to get to. Lisa got there after that, and then Jeremy. Hahaha, he was great yesterday XD. Followed by Carlos, and then, JANATHAN WHAT. He had just finished mega, so we chilled for a while.

Everyone else arrived (Krishna, Joseph, Bert, Rony) and we got on the bus, went to the place, ate our food. It was delicious as usual, but expensive too. >_>

Afterwards, we had a bit of difficulty in deciding what to do, and a bit more in deciding how to get Johnny involved in all the love. Johnny came up from Flushing, only to ride right back down with us immediately after. We played ABCD, bullshit, and chinese poker on the bus ride. I pwn at bullshit. =D It was a lot of fun. A lot of my busrides turn out to be really fun or just really enjoyable in general, especially late at night.

When we were getting on the seven to go to Bert's house, we lost Yoyo. =P Sorry! He failed to realize that he still had a transfer and was at the metrocard machine getting some more money into his card, and we got on the downtown train that was about to leave without noticing that he was gone. It was an ordeal and an epic quest trying to locate him again, but Johnny and I saved the day as usual.

Only me, Yoyo, Lisa, and Johnny went back to Bert's. We relaxed for a while and then watched about an hour of Team America: World Police, which sucked for the most part (sans the theme song. FUCK YEAH!) and then switched to The Big Lebowski, which ended up being one of the best movies ever. The Dude, the main character, is one of the coolest guys around, and it was just so weird and funny, it was great. 8D

Yeah, that was yesterday.

I don't feel close enough to my family anymore. We talk, but not enough. The bond is still there, but it's dusty. I want to spice it up again, but half the time I'm too lazy and depressed to try. And irritable. A lot of things have me down right now. I'm thankful for my friends, though. Days like yesterday really help me relax. Next friday should be awesome, too."

"event","Went to my dad's this morning & dealt w/his bitch of a gf....I seriously have never disliked someone so much in my life.  I dislike her even more than Ashleigh's dad, and if you know me, you know that's A LOT of dislike!!  Then we went to Wal-Mart & Ashleigh got some big girl diapers b/c she's been going on the potty all week!!!  Well, peeing anyway...she's only pooped on it once, but hey, it's a start!!!  On the way back, I called my friend Shaun b/c I hadn't heard anything from him for a few weeks & wanted to see what was going on.  I started giving him crap when he was telling me that things had been crazy & whatnot, saying ""Yeah, yeah yeah....I've heard it all before""....and then he tells me his dad had a heart attack & died 4 weeks ago....Talk about feeling bad!!!!  MAN!!!  I got home & there was an email from my brother-in-law saying my sister is in the hospital w/pregnancy complications.  She's been having problems all along so they were going to do a c-section @ 36 weeks....she'll be 27 weeks on tuesday & has been in the hospital for almost 2 weeks b/c she's bleeding & thye can't get it to stop.  So, they've said now that they're keeping her in the hospital til she has the baby or til she stops bleeding.  It looks like the baby shower next weekend is going to be at the hospital, as well as my neice Chloe's 1st bday (her bday, ironically enough, is the day after Caitlynn's & both have names that start w/C & Elizabeth for their middle name.....our older daughters both have names that start w/A & Nichole for middle name....strange, huh?  LOL)  But, the baby is doing fine so far w/his development & whatnot, so that's good news!  Well, that's it for today....

"event","Wow, the past couple of weeks have just been CRAZY!!  Caitlynn got over her pox, but then Ashleigh got them....along with a double outer ear infection & a probable inner ear infection.  So, I kept both of them out of daycare last week & my sisters took turns watching them so I could at least go to class.  
Chad & I got into a huge fight & almost ended things last Wednesday, but everything's cool now.  It was basically just a huge misunderstanding on his part of something I was trying to explain to him that blew up into something major.  But, it's all better now & he's actually opened up a lil more to me.  
Amber has decided she's finally ready to really be friends w/him...asking him how things are going w/us & not seeming bitchy about it at all.  She's even said she'd like to meet me sometime when she moves back up here.  So, that's a good thing.  I know how much Chad wishes they could be friends.  Hopefully she's being honest in her intentions & isn't going to move up here & cause a lot of drama."

"event","Caitlynn is doing really well...only one new spot & the others are scabbing over, so I should be able to go to class on Monday!  My two tests I'm going to be able to make up, too, which is awesome.  Benefits of going to a smaller school--profs KNOW who's serious & who's just playin around trying to get out of class. 
I also talked to Chad last night about some things & he says that it's not that he doesn't take our dating seriously....if he didn't, he'd go with his friends when they want to go lookin for hos & whatnot, but instead says that he's happy just dating me.  But, he says it's just that he thinks all of his past relationships failed b/c they got serious too soon & he thinks that if we just stay dating for a long time & things are good that everything will be work out & we'll be able to make it just fine.  Soo....patience is a virtue, right??  LOL  If only I had more of it...."

"event","OK, last week daycare tells me one of the kids in Caitlynn's class got chicken pox.  I'm thinking ""Great!  But what are the odds really of her getting them?""  Found out!  LOL  She broke out in a couple of places on her face on Friday, but they just looked like baby zits & I knew chicken pox usually start on the torso, so I didn't think anything of it.  I also didn't see anymore spots appear over the weekend, so I took her into daycare yesterday & went to class & to the Red Cross.  And then I get the call....she's breaking out more & has a slight fever.  Wonderful!!  So, today we went to her doctor just to make sure it IS chicken pox (and of course it is), and also found out she's got an ear infection.  ABSOLUTELY STUPENDOUS!!  So, now I'll be missing class for at least the rest of this week....UGH!!  But, at least she's not acting really sick or anything.  And, I also have As in all of my classes right now, so it's not like I'll have to worry about failing--it's just that I'm going to be missing 2 tests, plus I have a group project to work on in marketing....oh the fun!  LOL"

"event","this weekend has been crazy!!!  no time for much of anything, really...go here, go there, do this, do that...at least the girls have been good!!  i don't want to really do my homework tonight, but gotta do it if i'm seriously tryin to get a 4.0, right??  
wish i could see into the future sometimes....i hate the whole waiting to see where things are going to go.  feel like i'm wasting my time on someone who most likely is just going to walk away when i could be finding someone who will be there.  why does dating have to be so frustrating??  i think the majority of my frustration comes from the fact that i feel like i'm getting nowhere--we've been dating for 4 months now & aren't even exclusive or anything & i feel like since neither one of us have even gone out w/anyone else or anything, why not just be serious????  it all just makes no damn sense to me.  but, of course, i can't talk to him about all this cuz then i risk him sayin ""well if u can't handle things goin so slow, c ya""  but then again, maybe i should so if that's how it is i quit wasting time......."

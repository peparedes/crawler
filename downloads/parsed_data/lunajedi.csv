"event","The Lymphodoema clinic didn't happen. Prof Mortimer was ill. Not his fault i understand, but surely there's more than one expert in the place? Why didn't they have someone available to take the clinic in his stead?

Went to see T to fix my leg. I have been thinking about this long and hard. The problem started when I pulled a muscle in my right thigh. G had a go at it, and found a long rod of something nasty, which he pulled out. The T had a go at it, and found another dagger wound memory, which he tok out, but my leg's been up ever since then.

I realsied that whatever G had taken out, probbaly either had to go back, or be replaced. I told T who compare my legs. In my right leg, he found a void, where the rod had been pulled out. It was 'deep marrow yin eergy'. It had obviously 'gone bad' becasue it was hard, but when G took it out, it should have been replaced with good yin. The void was 'attracting' fluid to fill it. T (with alot of help) replaced the energy, and I could see my leg going down almost before my eyes.

I'm still feeling very down, still focussing a lot of negative emotion onto that leg, but hopefully, with the void filled, it'll get better"

"event","Things have been very up and down, hence my absence of entries.

I went back to the hospital to see my consultant. They tried to fob me of with a Senior Reg, but I put my foot down.

Miss Bridges asked how I was, so I told her I was pissed off. Pissed off with the admin cock-ups that sent my MRI scans hither and yon. Pissed off with still having a fat leg, and no sleep as a result of following her advice. 

So... they've referred me to the Lymphodoema Clinic. Why couldn't she have done that when I went in August with a leg like a tree trunk?? I've had another MRI scan to check that the 'mass' in my right hip has actually 'resolved itself' and wasn't just hiding behind my bowel.

And now?? 
Having dealt with the practical repercussions of the hysterectomy, having got over the anger of losing the choice as to whether or not to have kids, dealing with the fat leg and scar that makes me look like I've got two navels, I am facing the emotional turmoil of the loss of my womb.

The two things that define a woman as female are her ovaries and her womb; the rest can be faked. I have lost half of that, and I feel less of a woman, like I'm not longer 'real' or 'whole'. I am feeling very 'damaged'. Having whined because I don't talk to him, I talked to J about it, who basically told me I was being 'stupid'.  I *know* that there's more to my femininity and my identity as a woman than my womb, but I *feel* that I have lost it and it hurts, and it hurts more to be told I'm being stupid.

So I'm talking to people I can trust, and putting on the happy, chipper, positive face he wants to see, when actually I am none of those things.

I fought hard to rid myself of the BDD and I can feel it creeping back. and it's not nice."

Ack. Today was a baaaaad day. I went up to Fulham Marsden to have my lymphodoema draind off under Ultrasound guidance. The radiologist couldn't find it. 'No problem, we'll check your MRI scans to see where it shoudl be, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.' Couldn't find the MRI scans, they'd been sent back to Sutton >:o( So nothing got drained and I'm still stuck with a puffy leg. Not a happy bunny.

So, no notable successes today :o( Did manage to get myself a nice lymphatic drainage massage. Does that count?

Tuesday 13th September
Phoned the Marsden and got myself another appointment with my consultant AND managed to do so without losing my temper ;o) 
Cleared up a lot of the mess in my flooded lab.
Went to tai chi and had a good lesson, despite it being taken by S, who is G's ex, who thought that I was the reason they split up...

"event","has happened - I hardly know where to start.

I've been desperately unhappy. Jay and I have had serious talks about us, our problems and our future.

I have to stop giving him the power over me that I do. I have to stop allowing him to make me feel bad becasue of his behaviour.

On tuesday at my appointment at the Marsden I was told that my last MRI scan shows a 'mass' in my right hip that requires 'further investigation'. They have no idea what this mass may be. Of course I'm worried. The consultant thinks it's probably just a lymphocil, a lymph filled sac that's stopping the flow of lymph from my leg, and is interfering with the movement in my hip. Whatever it is, I'm faced with another trip to the hospital, and another procedure.

I have had supportive messages from my friends. Unfortunately Jay saw one of htem, from a male, signed with an 'XXX'. So of course I'm having a relationship with this person. Jay's gone into a fit of 'you've broken my trust' right at the very time I need his support.

What more can life throw at me. Haven't I had enough yet?"

No call today from Sir. Fine.

Went to see G this aternoon, needed a friend.

Waited till  7.40pm but he didn't come in. Fine. Went to chi gung.

Needed to heal, my right leg and foot are still playing me up, and obviously my heart's somewhat battered right now. 

Rab saw I wasn't so good and commented.

'Take take take' Take lots of energy, which was actually quite tiring in itself. 

Healing circle, lots of energy, G's hand was at my necK and I could feel the heat underneath it. Directed healing to my leg muscle and to fidn the cause of my fat foot. Got a real pain on the inside of my shin, found the blockage.

Meditation: worked on the blockage, smoothing it out. G's got his full Egyptian head on and tells me I need to go back to my original training. What my chaos stuff?? Syurely not? No back beyond that, back to my Isis training. I borrow a book from T, open it to any old page and there is a line which says it all....

Home. J's in the bathroom. He apologises again. We have a big talk. I told him how I felt & what he was doing to us.  I told him that if he had hurt me physically as much as he's hurt me emotionally, I'd be black and blue and we'd not be together. I also told him that one heart can only take so much hurt and that I've had more than my fair share. He asked what I wanted, I said 'to be happy' he said 'and you're not happy with me?' I said no.

When things are good they're great. When they're not they're terrible. Which is the same for most relationships I guess, but he can change on a whim.

I've done enough, I've worked really hard to keep this marriage together, and I'm tired. I've stood my ground to my own detriment, and have gone chasing after him when he's threatened to leave, or demanded a divorce. Enough's enough. 


He may have taken it on board, but we'll see. 

Friday 19th August
Baebes tonight. Am I Scared? Hell yeah. Scared the audience won't like us? no, don't care, scared the Baebes won't like us?? Damn right.

Having had my meeting and got my redundancy pakcage sorted out, I chatted to the guys. We have decided that we're not takign any annual leave - so they'll have to pay it, but we wll instead do one week in three 'working from home' ;o)

So this evenign I started to tell J this and got as far as 'We have decided that we're not takign any annual leave' when he jumped in with 'so we won't be goign on holiday then', didn't even let me finished. I eventually told him the plan and said 'here are my weeks off, you choose.  We managed to get into a big row because I didn't want to choose the holiday. He's the one saying he's tires, he's the one sayign he want's a rest, he's the one saying he needs a holiday, not ME, so why do I have to decide when we go?

Went to flamenco again, and had a good class, but my right leg is still painfull and my right foot is puffy again.

When I got home, J wanted to talk to me about Hirstmonceux. He said that he'd come the 1st day then see whether he'd bother with the next two, as i's all the same stalls, entertainment etc as joust. I said that was fine. He then said that as there was a castle there it mght stretch to two days. fine again. Then out of nowhere he starts on about filming us dance and putting it on a website and says' I suppose I'll have to e there for all three days.' I said' No, get us once that'sll be fine'. 'No, if it's gign on a websote it needs to be the best performance, blah blah ,blah'. i haven' asked for this, don't particularly want it, and he's makign a big to do out of it. I know that thses occasions aren't really his thing, and that he gets bored after a while, so i said I said 'Don't worry'. He's then tellign me that I don't want him to go. Eh?? Big row ensues, which ends with hism telling me to 'go f**k myself'. Charming. I don't rise, I don't bite, I just reply 'and yourself and then some' and have my bath and go to bed.

12.30am J wakes e up to say 'Sorry' and ' I didn't mean it'. I tell him that it doens't make it right, and he goes into the 'oh poor me' victim mode. 'I apologised nad you don't believe me'... Martyr martyr martyr. Oh please.

My right foot is up like a barage balloon and I've got a very nasty pulle dmuscle inthe back of my right leg.

T got me in for an emergency appointment before class. He found the muscle injury, it's a tear right in the belly of the muscle. He massaged it and chi-healed it, then used his funny electrical sparky machine to try and encourage tissue healing from the inside. I could feel the tingle along the muscle, which was fine until I had a massive pain in my hip which sent me almost through the roof.  

T found a memory of another knife injury, only this was was fatal, as it had gone straight throguh my femoral vein. He also 'saw' a large gothic style building with spiky iron railings...

Chi gung was odd. I couldn't really get into it, kept 'losing the plot' as I kept having to step out to pul pain from my leg. Had a memory of a lady in a red dress (self striped) with a white hat and a white collar, and the building was the town hall/ court house place where I was tried as a witch in 16C Genrmay.

H was also on a roll, lots of different memories.

also in 'building the columns' I saw some symbols on the inside. I will have to investiage what they mean.

J's been talking about going on holiday; Austria or Italy or somewhere. I think it's foolish to be thinking of it. I'm going to be out of a job soon. He says he'll pay for it, but if he has to put more into the house he can't pay off a credit card at the same time can he?

Heard from G, S has been round. He can stay in the flat & they've agreed terms for paying back the money he owes. It's all business-like and professional. I am relieved for him, at least he can get himself settled and sorted now.

In talking things through with G, I believe I undertsand what happened. 

I feel that Sarsen was presenting G and I to his troops. I know G has long been accepted by Sarsen, but I feel that we were being presented as a 'team', to work together.

About 18 months ago, at Devil's and Blacksmiths, Jez told me that I had no idea how powerful I was. I remember my instant re-coil. With power comes responsibility and I didnt' like the connotations. I remember conciously pulling back. Had Jez used 'strong' rather than 'powerful', I think I would have been ok with it. I know that I am much stronger now, but I think I had to learn that it's OK to be strong, thatI had to acknowledge my strength, and that in order to do that, I had to know how it felt to have no strength at all. I feel pretty certain that I passed whatever test or trial I had been put through, I'd passed. had I not, I would not have ended up in Sarsen's tent, stood on his left as one of his own.

"event","Last night was disappointing. J was tired and unresponsive as usual. He told me to go to Flamenco, so I went. But not to flamenco, just wasn't in the mood. I went to see G for a couple of hours. Which is always nice.

Work is getting very hard, sitting here knowing we're closing it's hard to get enthusiasm to do anything. Plus our air con is still nor working.

Chi gun tonight was odd. Started with the animal form as usual. Got a big dose of Nesta almost immeidately. Was doing 'tag the bull' in total synch wioth G. even when I tried not to. Was doing it very gently, then decided to give it some welly. Did the take down with lots of chi, and sent G flying (sorry!). 

Starting the 26 form, I felt astaroth to my left, and Sarsen to my right, between G and I. I felt the pressure of his hand on my shoudler. His right hand was on G's left shoulder, it was as if we were being 'presented'. I felt that if I'd opened my eyes all I'd have seen would be ranks and ranks of Sarsen's troops. Anyway, I started the form and was fine until 'Lotus rising'. 

Suddenly the Chi got very heavy. I couldn't lift my hands properly, so I stood in the 'self-healing' position. I tried to do 'loose the bow', but I couldn't separate my hands more than a couple inches. Same happened with separate hands. It was like trying to stretch a really strong elastic band. In the end I gave up and just sat down. I tried to ground, but just couldn't shift it. I felt totally 'flattened'.

When I went into mediatation, I found myself at an oasis at night. I was in full preatorian uniform, but my 'escorts' were in full bedouin outfits, but with blackened armour over the top. I was lead to a large black bedouin tent. Outside I was challenged by a guard; 'There are only two types of women here; cooks and whores. Which are you?' I grabbed the guard, turned him upside down, flung him on his back and put my sword at his neck. 'Neither'. I stepped over him into the tent. There was a long table, fully laden with food and jugs of wine and water. Behind that was a raised platform in the middle of which was a large ornate 'camp chair', with Sarsen sat in it, in bedouin garb. His black armour was on a stand to his left. On his right, stood leaning on his sword, in bedouin garb and black armour was G. Sarsen said 'so you finally got here then?' and pointed to the space on his left. Next thing, I was stood on Sarsens left, leaning on my sword, wearing black bedouin garb and black armour.

At that point T called us back. I was still shifting between me and Nesta. I asked G about the tent, and told him what I'd experinced in my meditation.

Still felt very flattened when I left. Hmmm"

Left Jilly's at 5.30 ish and I navigated via the A and B roads to avoid to motorways. Apart from Guilford and Farnham we hit very little traffic and between us Jilly and I must have 'bought' about 20 little houses in the various villages we bimbled through.

Reached camp about 9pm, set our beds up and hit the beer tent. Didn't bother drinking (more fun to watch the drunken antics of the others),watched Jilly being chatted up by two young Devons and retired about 10.30 (what a wuss!) only to be re-awakened by a roudy bunch of 'erberts at 2am!! Ack!

Sat 29th July
Rain, rain and more rain! Are my feet ever going to be dry?
Up, breakfast and 'de-21st century' the camp. A day of mediaeval merriement, helping the Towton boys with their 'armour piercing archery' demonstration and SHOPPING!! Didn't spend much though, bought a fork and an eating knife but spotted lots of potential nice buys.

Dinner at the camp, joined by the Baebes and associated chums.

Into the beer tent again, Jilly and I demonstrated the Sevillanas and fandangos for Vince and Piers. Lots of other peopel seemed suitable impressed as well. I was suitably impressed by a dashing young chap dressed as a pirate... Yummy!! (told him so aswell tee hee) A riotous time had by Jilly and I (much to M's annoyance, he was twitchy most of the day) and a late, very giggly night. As we got back to the tent M asked me if I was OK. I said yes. I then snuck round the back of the tent for a pee. As I was coming back I heard Jilly say 'She's fine, she's just gone for a wee!!' I then said 'I'm here and I'm fine. Fabulous in fact'. Here we go again!

Sun 30th July
Sunshine!!
Let's do it all again!! Discovered my pirate is one of the Talbot boys, and I had a brief chat with him, once he'd got over his embarrassment! More 'show ans tell' with the pierced armour and a bit more shopping. As we were leaving, we went to the beer tent to say bye to the Baebes to discover that Vince and Piers had raved about our danicng so much that catherine wants us to dance with the Baebes at their next gig in 2 weeks time!! 

Home via the same convoluted route and in bed by 11.30.

Only downer of the weekend: M. Once again doing his 'ask me a question and not believe the answer' thing. I caught him once and Jilly said he'd done it an number of times ask me if I'm fine, then as her if I'm fine. Does he think that I'm 'full-on mental' all the time, even us nutters need a break sometimes!! And apparently I was 'distant' to him. Well, d'uh!! When I've tried to explain to you some of what I've experienced and you 'pooh-pooh' it and tell me what I'm feeling is not what I am actually relally feeling, then I'm not going to tell you anything am I? I'd told him I'd changed. Now he's seen it for himself.

Monday 1st August
V's birthday and a day in Brighton being silly on the pier!! Home to a miserable J, spent the evening not talking to each other. Oh joy.

Tuesday 2nd August
Day off to recover. Bimbled about doing not much. Did some stuff at home and generally vegged. great. 

Tai chi this evening, very nice strong but gentle energy.

Home to a miserable J again. So what's new?? We had a talk. He's very very tired and very very stressed by stuff at work and worried because I haven't been talking to him or around him much lately. I explained that letely whatever I said or did seemed to be wrong, so I htough it better to stay out of his way.

Once again I'm in hte wrong it seems, but hey, I'm used to it now.

But I deserve better.....

Wednesday 3rd August
Back at work. Blah. It's hard to getthe entusiasm to bother coming in! but I must...
M phoned, He's spoken to Piers and apparently 'we' are all on the guest list. I'm not sure who 'we' are, but piers will be in contact soon anyway, as I'm helping out on his goth photo shoot soon anyway. Was very cool with M, obviously I need to put even more distance between us than previously. Like a moat, double cutain wall, portcullis, drawbridge etc etc etc..."

Chi gung tonight was rather odd. I didn't realy get anything for myself, but was flying about helping other people.
Jilly was in Diana mode, totally taken over, very strong but also very sad. Diana will keep digging at Jilly until she's dealt with that buried little stone she has. 
Rab was in 'negativity dumping' mode, but was fighting it. His astral self kept trying to run away and I kept having to go and bring it back. his negative emotions were swirling round him like a cloud, so I asked T to give him an athame so that he could focus it all away.

G was in 'shedding' mode. Layer after layer of false faces, fronts put up for other people, other people's versions of G, all came tumbling off, and the true him was left standing there, his warrior soul. Shining and beautiful. But it had to be 'sealed' it had to be acknowledged so that the layers wouldn't creep back on, so I got G to ask T to do his 'preatorian naming' again, to seal it all in.

So I left shattered but fulfilled. And i slept like a log.

Off to Joust later, got my kit ready, just a few more bits and pieces I need to find/buy, but otherwise I'm all set"

Vicky demonstrated the tai chi form, but I was too busy holding Cara's hand :oD

G and I did some work on Rab, to try and help him work from his heart not his head. G says he let something big go, which was great. Rab says he'll go and see G for some more work 'in private'

Friday July 22nd:
Another day at work, ho hum.  This eveneing I went to Ayzool's for dinner. We had big chats about what I've experienced at chi gung and got on to the marriage. The more I think about it, the worse it gets :o(

Sat July 23rd. 
Last day of term at dancing. Medal presentation went well, every body happy :o)
Another nothing evening, very down.

Sun July 24rd.
J had another section of his tattoo this morning, so I went to see G for a couple of hours. Time to breathe :oD

Popped into the high street briefly. Then over to Paul and Rachie's for Jamie's birthday party thing.

Monday July 25th.
A very very down day. Spoke to Dad and Carly about the situation with J and got very upset. I have come to realise that it's time for me. I have to be strong and start lookign after myself.

Went to flamenco at Wimbledon this evening, all new stuff, but it was nice to take my mind off htinsg for a while.

Tuesday July 26th.
Knackered, absolutely shattered, no sleep, tossing and turning. Tookt he day off. 

M phoned, Joust laat weekend wss great, Piers was asking where Jilly and I were. We are SO going!!

Tai chi: very gentle but very powerful energy. Had very explicit images at one stage!

Still V down about things with J

Wednesday July 27th
Slept ok. Work, ho hum. Went to see G this afternoon. Need some guidance on how to broach the subject of Joust with J. I want to go with Jilly, but without him. I guess i just have to be strong and tell him I'm going, but there will probably be sulks and fallout.

Spoke to J about Joust. Not a peep. Not one objection, just 'go then'. Wow. Unexpected but very welcome. I was expecting a strop, but it never came. Perhaps he could see I was resolute. I don't know. Once again in bed I got the whole 'I love you' spiel. I knowhe loves me, as I love him. But i also know that love is not enough. BUT I'm going to Joust!! Woohoo!!

Thursday July 28th
So here I am thursday morning. I'm going to pick my army camp bed up later, not sleeping on the damp ground, too cold!! I am pleased and excited. A fun weekend awy. I dug out my stuff last night, just need to buy a few provisions tomorrow and I'm sorted. Happy me!!"

Friday 15th July:
Went to see T at chi clinic. The three - yes three! adhesions on my scar were worked on. T thinks he may be able to snap them soon, which is great. He also did some work to fix my nasal nerve, to try and give me my sense of smell back. It worked, for a few minutes at least, but I haven't noticed any long term improvement. 
Had a lazy evening in, doing not much.

Sat 16th July:
Dancing and then another lazy evening. Too hot to be bothered ;o)

Sun 17th July:
Ack! Too hot, tooooooo hot. Stifling in fact. Popped briefly into the High Street, but just couldn't bear to be out in it. Lazy afternoon, then visits to mates in the evening, while J killed Germans (or was it Russians?) on the PC.

Mon 18th July:
Another day on my own at work, which was OK. Went round to G for a lymphatic drainage massage and to do some energy work with him. It went really well and I felt like I'd hit a real high. Came home and had a nice relaxing bath. Then I came down. Crashed down actually. Ended up feeling strangely used and very very upset.
Go figure??

Tues 19th July:
Spoke to G this morning about how I felt after yesterday. We both think it's some kind of unfinished business. So after getting my bald rear tyre replaced,  I went round again. This time it was G that got the high, and I kind of felt that I was already 'up there' waiting for him. Trouble was, we could get him back down. He went so far out of body he couldn't get back and being out there myself I wasn't strong enough to pull him down. It occured to me he needed his sword to help him ground. Then I realised he needed his athame and I needed the chalice, and that the two needed to join, which we did. At least now we know how to ground ourselves if that ever happens again ;o)
After that, my flamenco lesson was a piece of cake *lol*, but Manolo said he thought I looked 'glowing' :o)

Weds 20th July:
Work is work is work :o/ 
Nothing much happened here and nothinn much happened at home. Another night watching TV by myself while J played (taking Tobruk apparently). Slept well though. Perhaps a night in on my own was what I needed. Odd though, when J came to bed he told me that he 'completely and honestly' loves me and that he would 'never knowingly do anything to hurt me'. Which is a blatant fib, given the number of cheap 'below the belt' shots he's taken at me over the years. 

Thurs 21st July:
So here I am caught up. Today I spoke to M and promptly wish I hadn't. He has no idea of what I've been through, but he's trying to TELL me what it all means! Worse than that, but he's telling me that my understanding of it is WRONG!! AAAARRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!! Lord, Lady, Astaroth, Anubis, Fenrhyr and Sarzen save me from my so-called friends!
Calm, I am calm. M, I am in SO different a place to you, you couldn't see it with the Hubble telescope!!!"

Chi gung was OK. Did the usual animal form and 26 form, then T had us split into 3 groups to do small healing circles. Hmmm, not sure about that. I don't mind being a apart of a circle for someone else, but being in the middle? With a group of people I don't really know and certainly don't trust?? Nah! So I let them have their turn. The it was mine. Ratehr than 'accpet' their energy, I pulled up my own and sent it spinning in the opposite direction, just to see what would happen. What happened was that I nearly blew the circle apart. Tee hee!

When G sat in the circle I saw him as Osisris, sitting on a stome throne, with two long banners cascading down behind him, a black granite topped altar in front of him, arms crossed crook in one hand, flail in the other. 

So an OK nite. Chats with Jilly bean after wards :o)

Got home to Jay in a strop. 'Late lesson wasn't it?' No, normal lesson, then tea then gassing. 'Hmmph' Not doing this. Not letting him goad to me into justifying myself, when I've done nothign wrong. 

What doesit matter if I'm not there. He gets home from work aotu 7pm, by which time I've already had a couple of hours on my own, has a cuppa and a joint the a) falls asleep in front of the telly, b)goes into the loft playing games then comes down for Newsnight, but which time I'm in bed or c) plays on his PC and falls asleep up there.

I've lost count of the times I've told him I feel 'neglected' because he gets lost in his PC games and stuff and doesn't coem to bed till late. Well now instead of sitting there by myself, I'm doing good stuff, talking to good people in a good place. So TOUGH!!

Friday morning. 
I have the place to myself. got some skin to process, had a student nurse come for a visit, them I'm off to teach at Redhill this after noon. 
But my scra's pulling and my right ankle's all puffy. Need adhesions tretched some more, and a good lymphatic drainage massge."

A high mark would be great, but a pass is enough.

Spoke briefly to G. He was at chi clinic today. While he was there S rang and was bewailign to V. Again I was blamed. V told S she was being daft and that G wouldn't do that to her. Which is true.

Texted G, asked if he wanted to get out. He said he did.

Picked him up and went up to Kenley woods, to see the old beech tree. It's been a long time since I've been here. Way too long. He's still there. Slightly injured, but seemingly as strong as ever. 

Three little fox cubs came out to investigate. 

Finally, I feel calm and can breathe again.

G told me what'd happened to him last night. He'd set up his altar and called the gods. Sarzen had reached in and taken all his Chi. He was left 'powerless'. He said it felt awful. He'd cried (sobbed actually) thought a lot about Cara, thought a lot about life in general and finally collapsed on his bed in a heap. and subsequently had the best night sleep he'd had in ages.

He woke up this morning feeling great, feeling calm, knowing what he has to do and feelign strong enough to do it. Went to Chi-do had a blast with T. Then had a nice lazy afternoon with T, V and otehr friends.

Together we told Cara that we loved her and that we always would and that we were able to let her go, knowing she was happy and loved. I finally felt at peace with all this.

I texted then spoke to G this morning and asked him what he'd felt last night at chi gng and after.

He said he'd felt a pain in is heart, and thought he was empathizing with me, because of our connection. He said he had felt an energy and even though he didn't recognise it, he'd felt love from and for it. 

He said he'd wanted to come over and cuddle me when I was crying, but was worried what other people thought. Especially S. So he went outside for a cigarette and that she'd followed him out, giving him hell about 'being distant'.

He also said that he'd spent the night worrying that I'd decided that our connection was too much and was pulling away. 

So, I explained about the battle and the blow I'd taken. He said he remembered seeing me go down, and racing to get to me. 

I explained that the 'energy' had been 'our' daughter and that I'd sent her over to say hello. He immediately described what she looked liked (or rather how she had manifested herself). He was bang on.

He went very quiet for a while. All I could hear were muttered 'Oh gods' and 'yeah's. Then he said he felt like me, no paternal feelings at all, but that he feels as much grief for her loss as I do. He says it 'feels right' that she was ours, and that he's glad she's found 'us'.

I said that though I am sure her spirit has had other chances, I feel that now she's found us, she won't leave. It's like she's been waiting for G and I to re-connect.

So, we will be meeting later on to give her a name. I feel strongly that it should be 'us' and not 'me'. And I get the feeling that G feels the same way too."

I had a visitor, which isn't unusual. But this one was special. Very special.

She just stood in front of me, smiling. As soon as she appeared I felt a huge wave of pure, innocent love. And I knew who she was. And at that moment I remembered what had happened. 

G (as the Praetorian) and I were invovled in a particulalrly brutal fight, real hand to hand combat, fight for your life stuff. I took a bad blow to the stomach and went over. I bled heavily for a few days after, but didn't think much of it. After all, this was my job, it was what I got paid for, and it wasn't the first time. 

The little girl in front of me was MY little girl. The little girl I had lost when I got smacked in the stomach. The heavy bleed had been a miscarriage. I hadn't even known I was pregnant. I lost her before I even knew she was there.

I have not one single maternal bone in my body, yet I was overcome with loss and grief for a child concieved nearly 2000 years ago. I felt like someone had just told me that I had just miscarried my child. Very very sad. BUT, she doesn't blame me, even though it was due to my lifestyle at the time that I had lost her. She knows I didn't know she was there and she knows I would have stopped fighting if I had. And she knows I would have loved her. 

I told her to go and say 'Hello' to her Daddy. She went straight to G.

Anyhoo, I was distraught. In floods of tears. Had to go out into the kitchen. When I came back in, T came over. I told him breifly what had happened.

When the session was finished, I just slid down the wall. Still in floods of tears. I needed to talk to G about this, but he had pushed himself into a corner, and wasn't coming out. I wonder what's happened. Perhaps he's decided this is too much for him? 

Out in the kitchen S was being super-posessive, I couldn't get close. I must talk to G. Our daughter wants a name."

Spoke to the lady in HR who apparently wants these done 'Like NOW' and she didn't seem too concerned. 'As soon as we can'. We can do that.

So the end of the week. On relfection a pretty good week too, all in all."

Got to work this morning to be told that our job descriptions have to be re-written (ALL the bells and whistkes) and submitted to HR. By friday. As in tomorrow. They've had how long to tell us?? Typical NHS incompetance. >:o(

No point getting angry, so we get our heads down and get on with it.

Tap lesson went really well. Jan loves my new Pick up jive, likes the Appalachian steps I've put in it. She's confident that I'll do well. And she's promised to get Miss Mumm (my examiner) drunk at congress and tell her to be ncie to me! :oD

Very smiley happy.

WOW, chi gung tonight was amazing! G and B passed their massage exams, well done them. Very proud of G coz he was (by his own admission) struggling a bit with the writen stuff.
G, T, V amd I somehow managed to stand so that we were the points of a working circle and heck didn't we feel it!! The place was buzzing!! Sarzen stood behind G and at one point reached into him, and pulled out a ball of chi light, whcih he gave to me. I put it to my heart. G said at that point he felt like he was in my body, couldn't understand why he suddenly had long purple nails :o)

Jillybean took on the persona of one of her ancestors, a 10(ish) year old Gaulish boy, who took a Roman spear in the shoulder. I actually saw her as a 10 year old boy! Wierd. Afterwards she said she felt abotu 8 foot tall. she felt the same way I did when I first took Nesta in, incredible!!

I had Anubis behind me as always (a little too close as it goes...) and my two faery children (one boy, one girl) came to see me. I love that :o)

All night I just kept grinning. So much so that my face hurt.
Had to come down before I could drive home, and had to chill at home before I could go to bed and sleep."

"event","Had a call from T last night. He had a cancellation at the Clinic, so he could fit me in. 

Took the day off and went and got sorted. There are definately adhesions on my scras. The lowest scar has a big thick one, which is causing me th emost pain and dicomfort. T could snap it, but that takes a lot of doing and he could snap something else while he's there. So, he's started to stretch it. That way it should allow more freedom of movement, without it pulling. It will take a few sessions as it needs to be done gradually, but rather that than live with this discomfort for the rest of my life.

I've already had to make certain long term changes: don't eat 3 meals a day. Graze. Niddle wen I'm hungry, little and often."

On the positive side, I got the new pickup jive thing down. It works a treat!

Flamenco tonight was good. I know the Segurilla pretty much now. Still a few dicey castanet places, but all in all, pretty good. Now I work on the presentation.

Beckenham will be stopping over the summer, but Wimbledon will be carrying on, so I'll go to that class and keep my standard up. Need to if I'm performing this in spetember/October!"

J fell asleep in front of his PC. I woke up at 2.30am all the lights in the house blazing. I got him down and he fell straight to sleep, but Kashka decided to come for cuddles, which is nice but... between her purrs and J's snoring I couldn't get back to sleep.

I woke up as tired as I went to bed.

But

I woke up with new choreography in my head for the pick-up jive for Grade 3.

So not all bad :o)"

I am frustrated and angry. I have three lessons to go till my Pre-associate and NOTHING is going in. I got so upset with myself. This means so much to me and I'm doing crap.

Took it out on J which wasn't fair.

There is nothing in the syllabus that I can't do, but my brain just won't take it in and half the stuff I've choreographed for the 'Teacher's Arrangement's is rubbish. I need to start again."

Went to the local supermarket and had some trouble with a film crew. 'Do I mind not using that aisle?' Actually, yes I do mind! But all said with a smile.

More MSN chat with G. He and S are still together but they haven't talked things through yet. That will come. 

G says he keeps slipping back to wednesday night. Me too, it was a nice time and place."

Took Eccles to Uncle Bob to get his exhaust fixed.

Met up with Cathers and H and Amanda at Victoria, and was introduced to baby Thomas. Had lunch and then a sit in Green park. Very nice too :o) They seem very happy, which is great.

Got Eccles back, and he's purring now, not farting :oD

Back home, sent an email to G, just to let him know I was thinking of him.

Lazy evening.

A shift in places tonight. I was under the vortex and G was opposite me. T and V were between us. 

As soon as we started, Isis came to me. So I called Osiris to G. T was Geb and V was Nut. WOW!

By the end of the session my palms and soles were hot, burning with the symbols G had had on monday. G was the same.

In meditation I remembered being in the Temple, being prepared for the Great Rite. Wsshed, oiled, robed, perfumed, flower petals placed before my the works. I was to be Isis in the Ritual of the great Rite. G was Osiris. It was the first time we'd met.

Then switch to Roman Northern Europe. Swarming down a hill with G and about 15-20 oher crack troops, to ambush an enemy encampment. 

Talked to G after. He and S are talking again, which is a definite improvement from 'I never want to see you again'. He's scared of hurting her, but if he doesn't sort this now and it continues, it will hurt all the more if/when they split later. 

I hope he's ok."

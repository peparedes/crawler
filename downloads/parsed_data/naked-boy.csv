"event","Life without school is the win, only problem is, then that leaves more time for other things, like idle time of doing a whole lotta notta, and drama.  Yes I said it, drama.  What drama do I speak of?  Nothing LJ worthy that's fo sho.

But work is great.  That is one of the few things that get me through the day.  That, my girly, my family and friends.  Sure that covers everything, but eh, it works right?  Eh, so is life.  But work keeps me busy all day.  I come home and am just dead.  I even take naps sometimes, cause it's just so exhausting.  It's not like it's always hard, I just want to work hard to keep my job.  Because I know, at anytime, that if I slack off enough, I will be hasta la out of a job.  Private industry keeps me on my toes.

I got hella sun burned this past weekend.  Oh yeah.  Watch the girlfriend play some soccer, and forgot to wear sunblock.  Then we watched the team they are going to play next play, and that means I was out there for 4 hours with no sun block.  Yeah, I brown, but not like that :)  I got toasted.  Still a bit red, but it's all good.  Aloe vera gel is the win.

That's about it for now.  Take it easy everyone in the ethos of the internet.

""I am seeing tunnel vision in a world that's dark and cold, 
I cannot believe how much I've changed since the days of old, 
I know it's temporary but 
I need to focus straight, 
I cannot believe I lost control of my fate, 
I need forgiveness from the people I truely care about, 
I need support behind my back to help me spit it out 
I am gonna win, 
I can't afford to blow this one, 
I hate myself sometimes, 
I love myself, 
I need this way of life because it holds me
Contradiction's the way of life 
Happiness is wealthyness is healthy now 
I've made it through those lies and deceit, 
I think what's done is done and I can't complain anymore 
I am sure now that I've found myself again it feels great 
I can't believe I'd lost control of my fate ""

Hm...  girly had a soccer game, stupid ref tried to rig it for the other team, I got paid, but then realized how much was taken out (good ol getting over paid the month before, eh, happens :) ), and what else.... Oh yeah, went down to Socorro for Spring Fling.  :)  That was fun.  Watch a lot of basketball as well, good ol Florida.  Who knew that the Univercity of Florida had a basketball program, I thought it was just football.  NICE :)

This whole hour thing is throwing me off hard core!  AHH!!  I hate daylight stupid time.  What can ya do?

Tomorrow night is the concert, and the first time I have been out on the town in quite some time.  Should be fun, and I am meeting the band.  For some reason, I can't remember their name, but it's all good.  Just gotta bring the ear plugs.  Oh fo sho!  Call me a sissy, but I have been to more concerts than anyone else that I know.  I'm not even kidding when I say that. :)

Lets see.... Work is super busy, more so this week than any other.  Happens, so it's all good.

"event","Well today was fun, I thought for the longest time that it was Tuesday, why, I don't know, but eh, what can you do?  I built stuff at work today for our reactor setup.  Goold ol construction :)  I used all kinds of old parts for it, by old I mean, we prolly haven't touched them in years, but that's ok.

Life is pretty good right now, wish I had more sleep at night though.  What I mean by that is I don't think I enjoy the days like I should due to lack of sleep.  Now it's not the quantity of sleep, but rather the quality.  I have a shitty pull out bed, and should prolly upgrade soon.  Since my sis is moved out I could steal her full sized bed, I would atleast replace the mattress with a better one, if not just the whole setup.  I have got to clean out my room before I can do that though, because I have crap everywhere.  Most of it is old school stuff, so whenever I get a nice long weekend, where I have nothing else going on, I need to clean it all out.  Part of my cleaning out is actually giving away my old files from classes.  Figure someone else can benifit from all my hard work :)

I am still keeping all the books though.  I didn't pay hella lot for the ones I have kept because <a href=""http://www.half.com"">Half.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com"">Amazon.com</a> are my friends with the books.

So the STi I wanna buy is going to not be cheap, duh I knew that, but the thing is I thought I was going to get a deal on it, but since they sell like hotcakes, I will prolly have to order one, which means, not paying year end clearance prices.  Oh well, it's what I want.  My pops told me that no one will hold it against me if I wait a year, then I told myself that I would hold it against myself if I waited.  Why do I want this car so bad?  I have wanted it for 5 years, just ask Salad.  He's known me for most of that.  It's how I wanna spend my money.

That's about it for now.

But as far as stress is concerned, I have less now because I don't have school to worry about.  Sure there's job security and all, but I am not super worried about that.  Good times.

So I got a new phone, I gots me a PEBL :)

It's a definite upgrade from the P.O.S. that I had, freakin Nokia 6010.  Good phone, no features.  This thing is fun.  The reason I got it over the RAZR, well, no one has this phone :)  And it's fun!  Good times.

Well, lets see, Spring Fling is this weekend, so I will be going to Tech for that.  Will I be going to the bar?  Eh, prolly not cause freakin it is so depressing.  It really is.  Oh well what can ya do?

So yeah, first real paycheck this week, YIPPIE!  :)  This whole getting paid once a month thing is really weird, I am still getting used to it, but it does cause me to spend less, or alteast theoretically it does :)  This month, yeah not so much, but what can ya do?  Spend less next month.

So I am workin on buying a car this summer/fall, then moving out in the spring.  Knowing me I will prolly live on my own, I don't know of many reliable male friends that I would live with.  And so is life. :)

I don't think I will be going to my dream vacation, World Cup Germany 2006.  It's this summer, but there are so many other things I am saving up for, and that trip would not be cheap.  We'll see.  I will decide for sure in the next few weeks, that and I can't find my passport.  It's burried in my junk somewhere, but where is beyond me.

Have I changed?  Do I see people differently now?  Is it any of these reasons or something else?  That is what I keep asking myself, all the time.

I rather not go into specifics in the world of the Internet, but all I will say is that, I could really use a phone call, hug, somethin...  I feel like my world is crashing down on me.  I though life after college was suppose to be better?  So far it's been mixed.

Lets see:  my mom just left for Hawaii (she'll be back late next week), my dad left yesterday for Sacramento (he'll be back late this week), my sister moved out more or less, my truck is pretty much dead.... and like I said that is about all that I wanna say over the Internet.

So yeah, no parentals this whole week.... should be interesting.  Gotta cook for just one now, that will be the fun part.  Can't make too much cause it will go bad, good times.

It was way fun there.  We had pizza and a tour of the place.  They got lots o crap! :)  The thing that impressed me the most was their 1.2 MJ (megajoule) capacitor.... It could probably weld 2 cars together, if not more than that.  Good times.

Today was semi-productive.  People were out, boss was in vacation mode, and after lunch, I was messing everything up.  Why?  Because it was Friday.  See, Mondays and Fridays are mess up days for the same reason, you don't wanna be there :)  Work is great don't get me wrong, but it's just getting there, and leaving the house at 6:30 AM every day that is hard.

Other than that, everyone I know had a spring break this past week, go them :)  Oh yeah, and my buddy Seth wants to get the same car I do, same color and everything.  If he does, I am going to give him a sloberknocker that will knock him to next week :)  I don't even remember what a sloberknocker is!  HA HA HA!  Good ol Elementary school all over again.

Everything electronic I own is getting upgraded, except for my comp and vehicle.  :)  T-mobile was being, insert racial slur, today, because when I went to check my voice mail, ""Welcome to T-mobile voicemail setup""... um, burritto?  So I checked that, asked about how I could upgrade my plan or I would cancel, and yeah, life is good :)

So now I can either get a 800 min, unlimited nights and weekends for a one year contract or 1000 min, unlimited nights and weekends for a 2 year contract.  That means, hella minutes for the same price I am paying now, very nice indeed :)  So I think I am going to go that way, cause I like T-mobile and I don't drop calls unless I am out in the BFE of somewhere.

Work = good day, therefore life = good :).

Steve:  So why were you on the phone today?
Me:  I had to check why I have to pay so much on my next bill.
Steve:  Oh, so all that phone sex with your girlfriend is racking up those bills?
Me:  Naw, phone sex is only for old people.

p.s.  If you are wondering why that song is on my LJ, it just came on my playlist.  It has to be one of the best dance songs I know.  Check it out, you'll be very suprised.

I got conned into it by some buddies of mine a long time ago, but oh well, atleast I will have fun.  I haven't been out in forever and a day.  Why, cause I just haven't :)  I just haven't had much desire to.  All the Techies I used to party with have gotten lame, graduated and left forever, or have just straight up dissappeared.  I mean I have hella friends around the ABQ, but they all like different things.  Atleast it's never a dull moment.

Speaking of concerts, am I going to Korn... No.  Why?  Cause I have seen them 2 or 3 times already, and I have seen Mudvayne even more.  So yeah, not going.  Kittie is coming back...  I wonder if Falon is back in the band.   Last time I saw Kittie, Dec. 6th 200.  Why do I remember that date, cause I have all of their autographs on a pic they gave me.  Pays to have worked for a radio station :)

Paul Oakenfold is coming to J-town next weekend, but I am not going.  I have no big ass group to drive down there with.  All of my electronica head friends are in school still, that and I don't have reliable transportation anyways :).  That and J-town is just scary. :)

The best part about work, depending what I am working on, when my time to go home comes around, I go home.  It's wonderful! :)

I don't know why I find that so amusing, but in my world, a lot of things are amusing :).  For example, nicknames.  I was thinking about this when I was listening to the Bob and Tom show on 96.3 FM.  I was thinking about all the nicknames I have had or have called people in my life:

My Nicknames:  Jon, Jon Jon, JJ, J, J^2 (that's right 'J' squared), Joe, naked boy, waysupergoofy, Ami (German, short for American), Brillo Pad, Little Bunny Foo Foo (thank you Ben Ewing for those last two), Jurk (good ol Salad), Blues Clues.... I think that's about it

Unique One's I've Heard:  Zip (short for Zippity Do Da, yes that is a real name), Toss 'n Salad, weak sauce, Knob (seth), Jew (seth, cosmo, pretty much any guy friend), Pookie, Gonzo, Cher Bear, Jordanitis, Whitey, Butt (short for Butters from Southpark), Butt Jr (BJ for short)

Ug, so everyone at work has been giving me a hard time for my broken ass truck.  They are giving me an even harder time that I am borrowing my mother's jeep to get to work, cause it actually works.  Oh well, it's all good.  So from all of this I have come to the conclusion that I am going to buy a new car at the model year end clearances.  That means, I save mula on a car that I want.  I will end up financing about half of it or so, but that's not too bad right?  That's what my sister is doing right now, so we'll see when the time comes.  I figure the new model year cars come in around August, so that means I will buy a car late September or October.  We'll see when the time comes.

WOOOO!!), many leads on jobs (hell I got two calls this morning), and a lot of running around aimlessly around town.  I miss Tech though, not the school itself, but the people, especially my girly.  Wish I could see her more, but I suppose that is what the weekends are for, right?

I also had an interview yesterday with First Community Bank, working in their IT Department, behind the scenes fun.   Noice!  One of the calls I got this morning was from SAIC (very large employee owned company) and they told me that they were looking for Biology, but that they had forwarded my resume to Cabot and that Cabot was seriously concidering me for the job, cause it deals with polymers, and that's all I did this summer and fall.  So we'll see what happens.

Ug, gotta go to UNM today, and talk to the information people about the career fair on Thursday.  I hate driving there, cause there is never ever any parking.  Oh, and ha ha!  Instead of making a parking structure outside of the bookstore, it's now the new school of Architechture.  I know one person in that program, but then again, they will be graduated by the time this thing is built.  Why not another parking structure?  I mean, come on, there are 22,000 some students there, there needs to be more parking structures.  Look at downtown.  After the parking structure behind Century Rio 14, parking was much less of an issue.  I know the student body wanted that very thing, but of course what I have learned over at Tech, students don't matter even though we are the ones bringing in the big bucks.

Now I gots to follow up on leads.  Hopefully something will come up.  I know it will, just gotta have patience I suppose.  Good times.

That was the coolest survey ever!  Well, where to begin....  I haven't updated in a while, cause right now I am on shitty ass dial-up, and you would be pissed about the internet, if it took you a few minutes just to load the page to check your e-mail, much less do anything else.  Christmas was awesome!  That's all I have to say about that.  I got tons of loot, video games, clothing and what not.  It was grand!  The girly got me a ton of those games, I have tried to play them, but my computer either crashes cause it's old, or I need a jinormous update, and yeah, no highspeed = no update for Jon Jon.  Not yet anyways.  I hope to soon get a job.  I had an interview over the break, went well, and we'll see what happens.  Now I am just cleaning a lot and making sure that everything in my room is more or less tidy so that I can move around.  The pile-o-crap is slowly widdling down to something more manageable, but at time I swear I just need a can of Kerosene and a few matches, and that would take care of most of that :).

""I can't remember the time or place,
or what you were wearing,
it's unclear about how we met,
all I know it was the best conversation that I've ever had,
to this day I never found someone,
with eyes as wide as yours,
I've been searching up and down this coast,
overlooking what I need the most

did you notice I was afraid?
I thought I'd run out of things to say,
two more hours until today burns this away,
and it starts all over again,
the sky will never look the same again,
till you show me how it could be,
the sky will never look the same again,
till you show me how it could be

and everything else is irrelevant,
to the story so far,
a coincidence that you looked like her from afar,
is it true that you like to sleep alone?
Or is it what you just tell everyone?

Did you notice that I was afraid?
I thought I'd run out of things to say
two more hours until today burns this away,
and it starts all over again
the sky will never look the same again,
till you show me how it could be
the sky will never look the same again
till you show me how it could be

and when the world turns over
ill keep my ears to the wall
and when the world turns over
ill keep my feet straight on the ground

did u notice I was afraid?
I thought I'd run out of things to say,
two more hours until today burns this away,
and it starts all over again,
the sky will never look the same again

Even though I don't get a diploma till March, cause that's when they get printed out.  HA ha, gotta love the loser school I go to.  So until then I will get a certificate of completion.  Good times.

This break has been nice.  My little graduation shin dig was fun, a few friends showed up, something small, and that's all I wanted.  There were about 16 or so people, it was nice.  TD brought his ""child"", that was interesting, and thankfully my girly and her didnt' kill each other. :)  Salad had a good time too, talkin cars with TD and me, and figureing out what kind of car taht I want to buy.  Still torn between a Nissan Nismo Fronteir and a Toyota X-Runner as far a trucks are concerned and an STi or 350Z for cars.  Those guys are super knowledgeable about cars.  We had a good time.

The girly came over too, that was nice.  She had a way good time too, especially just watching the boys talk about cars, and being like, uh boys....  I am happy she came over.

Sister comes over tomorrow, should be fun.  Tomorrow is also D.S.L. and I don't know if I will be going to that or not, haven't decided.  He's a great DJ, but sister is coming in.  Oh well, I am sure that I will decide soon.

Job hunt continues till further notice :)

Helps that we don't ever talk/argue, but it works right?  I think I was always jealous of her athletic abilities.  Oh well it's all good.

Well she will prolly want to go snowboarding, so hopefully we will be able to :).  Good times good times.  Last time I saw her was for my grandmother's funeral, then again, that was the first time the whole family has been together in 10 years.  Pretty crazy.  I hope Ademar can come again, he's fun.  But it doesn't look like he will be able to this time.  Oh well, it's all gravy.

I am freaking out about school, not because I am doing badly, that's just one class, but rather because I am almost done.  Monday I will be turning in my exit interview, and then I will start filling out my check out form.  Should be interesting.  I have 4 keys to turn in, should be fun, NOT :)

A job will come, I can't force it, just gotta make some phone calls Monday.  Long week ahead of me, should be interesting. :)

I am still half tempted to leave on thursday with most of my loot and come back on Friday, I just want out.

Go figure.  And, I also haven't heard back from anyone that I applied with, but thats ok, some day I will, I am keeping faith.  Soon.

We won our first B-Ball game, and I didn't play, cause I had dodgeball coming up.  So then I played some Dogdeball, won the first game 3-0, then played B-Ball, lost.  Played the next dodgeball game, won 3-0 again, very close games though.  Played yet another game right after that, won 3-0, and we are again, <b>CHAMPIONS!</b>  YAY!! :)

So two seasons in a row, best team at Tech.  We played our hearts out, like we had nothing to lose.  We won it, we earned it, time to be merry.  Dead Presidents, forever more :)

That's about it.  I am still debating if I wanna have a going away party here at Tech, cause everyone I know is leaving before then.  I might just have a small gathering, then again I kinda wanna leave the same way I came in, quietly and into the night.  We'll see what happens.

""So don't take offense to anything I say.  I try so hard to keep you coming back my way.  But you don't know the half, and I'm the one to blame for it.  Cause I'm best known for failure, that's know for giving up.  There's nothing that I could say, that could matter, that could matter enough.""

I have hung out with the girly a lot though, which is suprising seeing as our schedules are so hecktic.

Ug I wanna be done though.  School is totally dragging me down now, it sucks.  I wanna be done, and employed.  I am very optimistic about employment, and we'll see where it takes me.  :)  Only time will tell I suppose.  I am not too worried.

Good times good times.

Well, I had a very chill weekend.  Sure I went shopping, bought some shit (Satellite Radio, DVD player, Green Day CD's, Kingdom of Heaven DVD) and slept a lot, it was great.

I honestly don't know where I will end up, and for some reason, this is one of the few times that I am not freaking out about it.  I have a purpose in life, and I may not be sure what it is right now, but I am sure that I will be guided to it in due time.  Sure it will be nice to be employed or have a job offer when I get out, but say it don't happen right away, I won't be mad, just patient.

Why the sudden change of heart you might ask?  Well it occured to me that even though I am frustrated about not having something, I also realized that most people don't have something lined up when they leave college.  Sure some do, but most don't.  It's not because they aren't smart because they are, but because it's not time yet.  But I will still work hard for a job, believe me I will work hard for it :)

December can't come soon enough as far as school is concerned.

On another note, a bunch of players from my dodgeball team played for other dodgeball teams that were short, and we won those games.  It was great :)  Also, we won our basketball game, that was fun.  I had 5 points, 2 rebounds, an assist, and a steal.  Sure that might not seem like a lot, but for someone as uncoordinated as myself (then again I snowboard on moguls better than most skiiers) that's quite a bit :).  My team rocks, they think I am so young.  Shawn asked ""So, Jon, you are a Junior right?""  ""Nope, 2nd year senior my friend, I am an old man"".

Here is something my buddy Salad had on his AIM profile, thought I would share it with all:
""In his mind, he has it all planned out
but like everythig he does
in never goes how he wants
so in silence he waits for her
not sure of himself, he begins to doubt
he feels the sweat beeding on his face
all he can hear is the silence, and
the beating of his heart
how intense it does beat
he is so nervous, his mind goes blank
and then she appears, and no
words can describe what he feels
or the way he feels about her
she says hello, and at this moment
all his worries go away
all you need is hello""

So yeah, the one thing I forgot to mention about the dodgeball game, is my girly totally won it for us.  She threw the ball at the other guy, and he tried to catch it, but as he was catching it, it hit the ground.  He totally got served!  (in a lispy voice) ""You got served""!

Speaking of, no games for our dodgegball team this week, so we are going to jump ship and play for other teams that aren't doing so well and help them out.  I'm not saying we are better than them, but we did beat them...  So might as well help them out right?  We'll see how it goes.

Our basketball team is doing really well too.  We have but one game this week, should be interesting.  So I have a chill week, which is good, cause I have a final on Monday in Biochemistry.  Hope and pray I do well, cause sometimes I just freeze up on tests.  Go me... :)

Oh and as far as what my employment looks like:
""I'm sick of smiling, and so is my jaw, can't you see my frown is going down?  I'm sick of being someone I'm not, please get me out of this sound.  I'm sick clapping, when I know I can be doing better for myself.  I'm sick of waiting, sick of all these words that will never matter.""

But after O-chem, I went to work until my Philosophy class, which I love, then off to basketball.  I forget the name of the team we played, but they held us pretty good until about half time, when we were up by 8.  After the half, it was all us.  We toasted them.  They put up quite the fight though, seriously.  I will give them that much.

Directly after that game, we played dodgeball, and swept the first team, and won 3-1 against the next team.  During the first team the girlfriend got out of teaching lab early and then came and watched.  She totally motivates me, like woah.  That second team, had Theo on there.  That should explain a lot right there.  But anywho, he was sayin that they had us (yeah, not really) and that they weren't playin good.  I dunno, all the games were very even, I think so anyways.

It didn't help the matter any when our team had 3 dodgeball games on the same night.  They were all fast games, relatively speaking seeing as we swept all of them.  The way we play, it's whoever wins 3 matches first, so best of five.  We won 3-0 in all of them, so we are totally undefeated, go Dead Prezidents!  What else....  Well dunno, nothing too exciting I suppose, just a lot of school and what nots, but hey, what can ya do?  So is life, good ol school :)

I have been thinking ""what amd I going to do with my life if I don't have a job lined up by the time I am done in December?""  I don't know, I suppose that time will come, but I hope it doesn't.  I think I have the DOE lined up, but I have to format my resume the way they want it, so that's what I'm going to do.  Make it perty.  I'll sell myself to Kirtland AFB, cause it would be nice to stay home for a bit till I get established in a career.

I have also been thinking about what video game I wanna purchase in the near future as well as after I graduate.  Why is this?  I need something to do to pass what little free time I will have.  Sure I gots me friends all over, but they are always working fools, 40 to 50 hour weeks.  They barely have time for themselves.  Especially my buddy Toss, he's married and has a kid already.  He's got no time.

So far for ABQ gaduation Party: 10ish... don't really know yet just a guess, don't worry Techies, I plan on having one down here as well, dunno where or when, but it's gonna happen.  Werd life! :)

35 days till I am forever done will college, well that's the plan anyways, unless the company I work for sends me back for more.  Noice :)

"event","I had a ton of fun this 49ers <a href=""http://infohost.nmt.edu/mainpage/events/49erssched05.html"">49ers Schedule</a>!  I really did.  Not as much fun as Froshy year, then again, the school wasn't lame then.

Friday:
We won our football game!  WOOT!  So I get to leave on a high note of winning!  NOICE!  :)  38-12!  We had some sick plays, like Dailey's INT for a TD!  HA HA!  I nearly got a sack, and a fumble.  Not bad for such a Nerd hu?  Nerds Rule!  Then I went to do a whole lotta nothing the rest of the day.  I win :)  Our BBQ in the La Raj got dismantled by Campo, why I dunno but what can ya do?  The bon fire was pretty cool as well, but didn't win anything, but did get me some free loot!  Yay for free shirts!  Oh yeah, I also went to the bar, that was freaggin great!

Saturday:
Paintball.  We got hosed the first game, then I got more paint, new teams, and we pwned some bishes!  Good ol Spyder Imagine, I love that gun.  The only reason I went out on one of the rounds is cause I did run out of paint, go figure.  I don't know how, I just did though.  I went to casino night, got hosed on poker, so I helped out with the roulette table.  Oh yeah, we had some mega winners there, pretty crazy actually.

Sunday:
M-mountain run, oh so hard!  I didn't have a sack most of the way cause I tweaked my back, and yeah, that sucks.  I suppose I need to actually hit the gym and lift again.  Ha ha ha!  But then again, my arms and legs are stronger than ever, just my back sucks.  Go figure.  Then did laundry, studied for Biochem, and cleaned a lot.

I hope I do well on my test, it's nomenclature, and I am no good with that.  I am better with functions not definitions.  Weird I know, but I don't memorize things, cause that's not my thing.  I'd rather have a concept with some facts, than just some random babble that I have to regurgitate later.  OH well, good luck to me I suppose :)

So classes are going to pick up hard core next week, got me two tests.  Not as bad as a few weeks ago where I had 4 tests and an essay.  Yeah, fun week hu?  I did bad on only one of the tests, and that was Psychology, go figure.  Ha ha ha, I am such a n00b.  But this next week, these tests are in my strongest subjects:  Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry.  Think of it, a chemical engineer needing chemistry...  coincidence?  Werd!

Only 8 more weeks till I am off like a prom dress.  I will have a friends only post with all the info as it becomes more available to me.  I am thinking a get together here at Tech for all da Techies and another one for all the ABQ kiddos.  Sound like a plan?  I just gotta get there first.

<i>We lost to the Cabras once, but...

Gentlemen, this intervening time has not tempered my rage, and I believe the same can be said for you. We cannot let theirs be the last blow in this contest of wits and strength, when the superior skill set is clearly our own. The coming revenge must be nothing less than catastrophic in scope and crushing to the spirit. Not only will our counter devastate all hopes of overshadow by a scheme of their own, but it will cause them to rue the day they ever had a glimmer of a thought that the consequences of crossing the likes of the Dead Presidents would be in any sense acceptable by even the lowest standards of humanity or in any way tolerable to its fragile specimens</i>

"event","So I get my Psych test back today, about average in the class.... Yeah, not very good.  Why is it that I totally rocked my hard 300 and 400 level tests, when I totally suck at the Freshman level one?  WTF mate?  Oh well, it's all gravy.  I will do better on the next one I suppose, seeing as there are only 2 more left in the class.  Ha ha, eh, oh well, it's all good.

Other than that, dodgeball is doing great.  We had about 50 people show up in an impromtu fashion.  We have our mass war on Tuesday nights, but Monday nights are now getting super popular.  What I don't get is why the gym won't let us use the gym more than once a week.  I mean, we are the largest club on campus, by far.  Astronamy Club tries to claim more and I just laugh at them.  Stupid nerds.

I met some dude form Germany the other day and of course, had to bust out the German.  I totally need to introduce this guy to Jana (pronounces Hah-na ;), and yes I do wish do be beaten up) and we could totally just bust the German for a while.  That reminds me, 49ers!  WERD TO YOUR MOTHA!  This year will be swell: alumni buddies, Dustin (coming back from Iraq), and a whole shit ton of us Chem E's just getting shit faced and talking smack about everything we can conjure up.  Ha ha, we are the beligerant group.

I am also getting the feeling that my former roomate JW has rubbed off on me a lot.  Cause anytime I see Rowland (our non-african black man on campus) I always say stupid things like ""Token Black"", ""Where's your bling..""  you know shit like that.  Yesterday during dodgeball he said he was tired, I replied ""But I thought you were used to running, you are black afterall.  (Pablo Fancisco style) Now, let's run from the police!""  I am aweful I know.  Still not as bad as telling my friend Sarah Gonzales to make me a poncho.  Then she always tells me to make her a grass skirt.  It works both ways. :)

""Yeah, My girlfriend, Takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive.  And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys.  She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does.  She brings me mexican food from Sombrero just because, Yeah, just because.""

Ug, so yeah, what to report:  tons and tons of homework, like I said before my freaggin electives are giving me more homework than my real classes.  HA HA HA!  I love electives about as much as I enjoyed mono.  Freaking mono.  Speaking of, it has infected a few of my friends.  How I have no idea, but I just don't want it again.  Cause that would be $ux0r$!

What I found kinda sad the other day, I was making fun of some of my buddies for playing hours of World of Warcraft, and they were like ""Ha ha, you are totally wrong Jon Jon...""  Um... It's a freaggin video game :).  I don't care, why?  Cause I'll play an hour a day, be done.  They will play literally all weekend.  Sad hu?  Physical activity won't kill ya.  Goofy ass geeks!

Oh, dodgeball is going well.  We squeaked by our first round the other day.  Dunno how we pulled that off.  We all were not playing well at all.  All I gotta say is I hope we play better this week.  We are playing an undefeated team.  They are pretty good, but we almost beat them.  By almost I mean, the very last game it was a 2 on 1.  Freakin barely!  Good times!

We did the good ol park and ride, that's the only way to go.  $1 there, $1 back, and $5 for getting in.  Over all, I spent only $14 for that.  Not bad ay?  I got some random stuffs, just random.

I think I am finally over whatever sickness plagued me for the last few days.  I call it the Socorro Sickness.  Everytime I come back to Socorro for school, I get sick.  Doesn't matter how fit, healthy, whatever... I still get sick... Stupid town.

"event","why do you always depend on me to be your ride to meet people?  sometimes its okay

but asking me to pick up this random person you want to me and i have not a clue who the fuck they are and have to take a 45 min car ride alone with them to your house?

even if you were joking you've asked me to be your ride to meet these people you meet online... and that puts me in a very odd position...

your my ex... im not really the best person to be taking you to meet people because of that...

you do realize it makes me feel like you are rubing it in my face that you can get these girls SPECIALLY cuse this one is in pittsfield? you dont fucking drive...

i hate that you cant find people in your own area to go after...

i mean yeah i might be moving.. but still... fuck off...

you are my friend and i will support you...

but it seems the g/f's you've had since me have been for sex and well sex is great and all but its just you've made it a pattern for that type of thing to happen...

this post is a waste of space prolly but i had to get that out somewhere shim couldnt see it..."

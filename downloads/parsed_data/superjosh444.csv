"event","I am so tired right mentally an physically. We spent most of this weekend hanging out with the friends we have made here when we should have been packing so today was spent rushing to get every thing done. This is kinda the norm if you know Karl and I but still packing a whole house well 1100sf apartment in a day is a bitch. We should be leaving here in a few hours but I don't think we are going to make the deadline. If nothing we will just leave later in the day no big deal as long as its cool with the manager. I am so not looking forward to traveling for 20+ hours with two cats but I will be so happy to be home. Any ways I am gonna get off of here shower and head to bed. ."

"event","The closer we get to moving day the more I stress. My stress level is a bit high but I think that I am handling things well. I am not saying that I'm a joy to be around right now or any thing but for the most part I have control of my depression. I don't really want to call it depression but I cant seem to articulate how I feel. I can say that it feels good to say that I am doing good with my issues. Me feeling good about myself is a bit of a change for me. I tend to be hard on myself and focus on what a bad person I am. I know I'm not a bad person but I have done a lot of bad things. If I continue to do good things or at least good things for me like bettering myself then some day the good will outweigh the bad.

I want to get back into writing in here every day again. I have been out of touch the writer in me for to long. Can you tell by the run on sentences and such? Any ways I am going back to bed its too early to be awake."

"event","So much has changed in my life since I last posted here. A lot has changed since I last talked to most of you but I know most of you know whats going on for the most part. 

I have been disconnected with every one and thing in my life over the past year or so, I have been dealing with all of my internal problems and trying to better my life and who i am as a person. I did not like what I was becoming. Over the past few years I have been through more than I ever imagined possible but it has made me stronger. I know myself now and my limits and that the worst is over. I am for the most part happy with my self and my life partner. 

But yeah any ways things are good. I am excited to be coming home. I have been out here just short of a year now. It has not been all that bad here at all. We stay home a lot so I think that's part of it. I don't think I would get along with most of the locals to well. I have met a few good people as I do every where my travels take me. 

Any ways I was just playing with some tools my linux OS has on it and one of the things is a LJ journal post app that lets you edit your post in a word style program. I used to use something a long time ago for windows when I used LJ every day so the same is likely to happen again :)"

I feel that I need to say sorry to all who were there for the shit that happned. I am so so so sorry that Brian and Griffin had to be part of the mess I got myself in to. I know friends are there for each other but I should have kept my mouth shut. I feel like an ass, nothing new there. It seems like I do that a lot. Any ways Sorry guys and I love you."

"event","So it has been a year to the day that my moms life came to an abrupt and unexpected end and I'm still here. I never knew what I would do with out her by my side. I always said I would take my life the day she passed because she was the reason she was living. I know I have something to live for I just haven't found it yet and don't think I will any time soon, however I am still searching. I have been so lost and confused.  All I want to do is curl up and die. I fucking hate this pain that I feel. I feel empty and alone. I am the last of my kind. I have a brother and sister that share my fathers blood but I am the only one that caries my mothers. I honestly don't have family out side of my friends but deep down it is no where as deep. Sorry guys but every one knows blood is thicker than water. I feel as if my heart was ripped out of my chest and these are my last moments all I can focus on is the pain and the past. 

 Sorry on another note I am going to try to make it out to mt. helix and light a candle for her and say a prayer. One of my happiest memories with her was up there. I had just driven back to San Diego from Las Vegas and I picked my mom up and we went for a ride. I asked her if she had ever been up there and she hadn't so off we went. She loved it, she had just started to get sick so she was not getting out of the house much. We went off hiking and she saw a lizards, my mom being the animal person she was started chasing them down saying she wanted one and how cute they were. (thank god I have a water proof keyboard) she was a country girl in the city so when she get to be around nature it was always soothing. It has been a place I have went to think for years now.

I miss her so bad. Ours lives were hell when she passed. All I wanted was to give her the life she deserved. 

 Fuck fuck fuck I hate this I don't want to be awake any more. I want to sleep until I can see her light again. I just want to sleep. I don't to feel this any more.

 I am okay but still in pain and I know there is nothing that will make it stop. Who ever said that time heals all is fucking wrong!!!!!!!!!

I miss you momma.

"event","Just a song that I came a crossed that I have felt. All I wanted was for your mom to know that I loved you. I wanted to be family. My mom accepted you with open arms. She knew my choice would not change for her so she did not judge you, she only loved you as my partner. I only wanted to be accepted. I am a person with feelings, that will not be treated like a dog or even less. 

Its over now so I guess this is point less other than to note that I have felt this. 

White stripes 

I want to be the boy that warms your mother's heart
I'm so scared to take you away
I tried to win her over right from the start
But something always got in the way
We've been sitting in your backyard for hours
But she won't even come out and say hi
While my mother baked a little cake for you
And even dreaded when you said goodbye
What kind of cartwheels do I have to pull?
What kind of joke should I lay on her now?
I'm inclined to go finish high school
Just to make her notice that I'm around

Well nothing I come up with seems to work
It feels like everything I say is a lie
And never have a felt like such a jerk
I'm afraid to even open my eyes
Because I really don't want her to judge me
I want to her really know who I am
And then, and only then she will love me
Well at least that was the plan

If ever a boy needed a holiday
If ever a girl needed someone to hold
I just hope I don't act the same way
By the time that I get old

I never said I was the heir to a fortune
I never claimed to have any looks
But these kind of things must be important
Because somebody ripped out my page
In your telephone book

I want to warm her heart"

MARILYN MANSON LYRICS

""Para-noir""

[dita:]
I fuck you because you're famous.
I fuck you for your money.
I fuck you to control you.
I fuck you so someday I can have half of everything you own.
I fuck you to fuck you over.
I fuck you 'til I find someone better.
I fuck you in secret.
I fuck you because I can't remember if I already fucked you before.
I fuck you out of boredom.
I fuck you because I can't feel it anyway.
I fuck you to make the pain go away.

[Manson:]
Fuck you because I loved you
Fuck you for loving you too
I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do.
Fuck you because I loved you
Fuck you for loving you too
I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do.
HATE YOU THE WAY I DO.

[dita:]
I fuck you so I can feel something instead of nothing at all.
I fuck you because you're beautiful.
I fuck you because you're my nigger.
I fuck you because I am your whore.
I fuck you because you are a whore.
I fuck you for fun.
I fuck you for fun.
I fuck you because I can.
I fuck you so I have a place to stay.
I fuck you so you will protect me.

Fuck you because I loved you
Fuck you for loving you too
I don't need a reason to hate you the way I do
Fuck you because I loved you
Fuck you for loving you too

"event","I have been down he past few days. It all started out the other day, I cleaned out my car which has all that I posses in this world. I came acrossed a few of my moms purses. The purse she was using when she had passed I left un touched. There was a doller bill and some change, a ring, her glasses and a few other things. I opend it up and the doller bill change and ring were missing. No one had access to my car so I dont know what happend to it. I dont think the stuff was there when I got it back from my Step dad Terry. This saddend me. It is stuff that was hers and I wanted it left the way she left it. I started to cry....  lot. I put her glasses on seeing the way she would see with out them. Balling and just about screaming ""I miss my mom"" I am comeing up on the one year anny this March. I am so depressed right now and need a hug. I think this is the biggest reason I can not be with Kirby. I am a needy person. I get depressed and need to talk or just be with some one that understands my feelings. I dont think he has a clue. Any one want to hang out? Please. I hate how I get. My brain dose not work the way normal peoples do. I want to hurt my self ont the outside like I hurt in. I am so unhappy right now. 

I rember a few months befor mom passed, sitting in her room and watching cmt. A song by Reba McEntire came on. It was He Gets That From Me. I rember it makeing me cry and mom holding me tight and crying with me telling me that every thing is fine and that she loved me. I'll post the lyrics so you might see what this was all about.


Artist : Reba McEntire

Title : He Gets That From Me

Album : Room to Breathe

 
 
His early mornin' attitude: 
You have to drag him out of bed. 
Only frosted flakes will do, 
He gets that from me: 
Yeah, he gets that from me. 

His curly hair and his knobbly knees: 
The way the sun brings those freckles out. 
Talk and talk, never miss a beat, 
Yeah,he gets that from me: 
He gets that from me. 

He looks at me with those big brown eyes: 
He's got me in the palm of his hands, 
And I swear sometimes it's just like you're here again. 
He smiles that little crooked smile: 
There's no denying he's your child. 
Without him I don't know what I'd do: 
He gets that from you: 
Oh, he gets that from you. 

How he loves your old guitar: 
Yeah, he's taught himself to play. 
He melts my heart: tells me he love me every day. 
And cracks jokes at the perfect time, 
Makes me laugh when I want to cry. 
That boy is everything to me: 
He gets that from you: 
He gets that from you. 

Last night, I heard him pray: 
Lord, help me and mama make it through. 
An' tell Daddy we'll be okay: 
He said he sure misses you: 
He sure misses you. 
He really misses you: 
He gets that from me. 
 
 
I am not okay right now. I am going to get out of here for a little bit. I am going to Le Stats. If any one can join me please do. If not it is okay I know this is last min stuff.
I'll post later"

Any how I remember jack from the party. I remember taking a few shots and leaving with Karl to go get cigs and not much more. People have been telling me about stuff and I am shocked I dont remember. If I offended some one I am so so sorry. No more drinky for Joshy for a few weeks. Any how I am going to go take a nap and then go to work. God I need some rest."

She was laying on her back head tilted to the side a little, I guess she puked in the middle of the night or something but looked like she was foaming from her mouth. I woke her up she was very lost. It was hard to get a responce from her. I would ask questions that would make her think. I was trying to see how aware she was. In about 10min she was okay. This is the first time this has happend. I wounder how long she was like this. I went to bed around 3 and she was sleeping on her back. I am not sure if I can take this job any longer. I am starting to think she would be better off with the state. I am so lost. This makes me want to run away. I was not ment for this job. In a home my mom will get better care than what I can provide. I love her so much, it just kills me to think about this.

We have around 5 days to get the rest of our stuff out of the apartment and yet we have nothing accomplished but a few boxes. Well most is boxed but not in storage yet. Transpiration is being an issue. My mom still is not sure where she is going but has a few options. She can go to Rosies for 2 weeks and around the first fly to Ohio. I think this might be a good idea for now. I know that I have a place to stay so that's cool.

The other evening a toy called me to talk. We talked from around 4:00am until around 6:30am. Kirby is a friend mine. He put a smile on my face and made me feel a little better about life. He also spoke of future plans. Sounds like another long story to me. We will see when we get here. Long story but he won't be back until April. :

"event","Well my day is over yet another day of staying home and helping my mom. I am tired of being at this house and having shit for a social life. I about went to le stats tonight. I got the info on how to get there by bus and walked to the bus stop. I got there was bored so I walked into the 7-11 to get a drink. Came back out and started to worry about if my mom was going to be okay. I would have had to be out till 6am because of the bus. So I debated for about 10 min on what to do. The bus arrived and I just sat there. The driver was like what are you doing, coming or going? I said the hell with it and walked into 7-11 to get my mom a slurpie and went home. GOD I WANT TO CRY.  I am so tied to my mom right now, I need to get out and do something. This stress is starting to get at me and I am not feeling any better today that I did the day before.  I am writing a lot more again so I guess that's a good thing.

But any ways, I called Karl tonight I think I interrupted him during his meeting. I told him a little about this evening. I think we are going out for coffee Monday around 2 am. I am not sure if this is a good or bad thing right now. I care about him and miss the hell out of him. I am just a confused person right now and no answer that I can come up with is right or wrong. I'm not confused about wanting to be with him but rather letting my emotions get in the way of my logical thinking. My needy feelings right now leave me very teary eyed and just wanting a hug. I miss having someone to hug when I feel the way I do. Karl was the reason I snapped out of this kind of self destructive path. I guess not really snap out of but became my light. The one I ran to for the hug I long for. I went 9 months with out any thing, trying to find what I thought to be him. I honestly do care about him and I know he is still a person that I let into my life and I feel I can talk to. I feel like I can be ""me"" around him. I just hope it can be the same and not feel all weird. I was in a 5 year relationship before this. I just don't know where I'm going with this just that again I feel like I have expected more than what anyone is able to give. I have to make myself happy. I need to hug myself. Sounds like something a lonely person would say err what a minute that's me. I do love me but I hate how messed up my brain is. I guess I do have a lot of co dependence issues that I have yet to overcome. 

Well I'm off to bed Chance and bob I'll give you two a call in the afternoon I have a lot of crap to do in the am.

SCREW MEN. Oh yeah I'd love to. Just thought about something someone once said ""sex is like pizza, even if its bad its still kinda good""."

"event","Well I'm back and going to continue on my last post. It was a long day or work. I had to take my mom to the mall and to pay a few bills. Keep in mind this is all on the buss. It took us all day like from 9am to 8 pm. It is almost a 12 hour shift. I now it is not the same as say working in fast food but hard just the same. 

It was freaky, We had to stop at the El Cajon transit center and change busses. We had a seat and waited. I lit a cig and looked around bored out of my mind. I saw this black guy walk by and automatically was like that was one of the guys the other night that jumped me and stuff. Then I started to think well just because he is black dose not mean it was him. Then I got a better look and it was one of them. Same braids and talked the same. I remember he was the one with the gun he was there with what I think to be his girl friend. I told my mom the he was one of the people. She freaked out and wanted to go get a cop. I was like don't do any thing. Just leave it be. He got on the same bus as us. I don't even think he looked at me. If he did he then he did not remember my face. That was hard for me to deal with. It is a good thing I did not have a gun .I would have come up from behind him and put it to his head and messed him up. I don't think I would have used it but I know if you are going to pull it out you better be ready to use it. I am not cold like that but people that do bad things deserve to have bad things happen to them.

The rest of the day was nice. I got to talk to my mom about life and stuff. I know se is down right now. we both just got out of long term relationships. Hers was a lot longer than my last one.3 or 4 years together. Mine was only like 7 months.B-4 that I was in a 5 1/2 year relationship. We talked about how she feels and how she is going to deal. I felt good about our talk. She is a little down and I am trying to help but it is hard to deal with my own problems right now.

Last night I went to my friend Becky's house to hang out for a little bit. Her b/f is out of town and might not be coming back so she is down. We just chilled and talked about our lives and how things are not all that good but that we still have each other. She is my best friend in the whole world. She's my babies momma LOL. If I were not gay I think we would be married. I took here and our daughter out to dinner (winnersnitzle) and I went home around 9pm.

As far as to day goes I dot have any plans but think I might make it to le stats tonight. :  


Sorry about the books people just a lot on my mind and feel lie writing that is what a journal is about right"

"event","GOD!!! Life sucks.  The worst part of life is dealing with Ex-boyfriends. I know that I love him. He still messes with my heart. He just gave me a silver necklace. I am not talking T.J. silver. He just made me like all mushy and stuff. Then I got real cold. Started thinking about what he wants from me now. We broke up ten months ago. I wanted to get in to a marage councilor so we could work on our issues. Nothing fell through with this idea. He had a boyfriend (and by boy I mean it) at the time and was always pushing me away. Now that I have a man-friend he is actually following through with things we talked about a long time ago? About three years ago he had said he wanted to get me a nice necklace. I guess that day came 10 months 2 weeks and 5 days late. I doubt it was a just because sort of thing. It is just to odd.

Karl is so afraid that I am going to leave him for Allan. I know that I love Allan a lot but neither Allan or I are are where we would need to be in our lives to even think about a relationship with one another. We would just still have the same old issues. If he were able to prove that he could refrain from lieing to me and If I could open-up to him a little more things might be different. I know I have the power to make my end work but I dont think Allan could hold up his. I tell Karl all the time he has nothing to worry about. I know I am not in love with Karl but I care about him so much. He is a good person and treats me very well. I am happy. I like to think of my self as a smart person. I know what is smart for me. I dont see me and Allan being more than friends. 

Okay I'm dont for now I am tired and kinda drunk. zZzZzZz"

"event","Well I have just realized That I have not cried over Allan in over 3 weeks. I don't think I am over him but I have reached a point where I want to work on me. I know that I have some issues that I need to take care of before I need to be concerned with him. I love him with all my heart but I know that being with him I would be jumping in to a high risk relationship. I know he has done me wrong before and am afraid it would happen again. I'm tired of crying.

I am happy in my relationship with Karl. Every thing seems so normal. He makes me happy in ways I have not seen before. I only hope to make him as happy. I know I am not in love and I should not expect to be this early in the relationship. We are taking things one day at a time if caring turns into love then I won't stop it. 

I always want to be a part of Allans life, as a friend at the very least. I just don't want him to hurt me any more.

As far as working on myself I know that I need to find a good job and get out of my moms house. I need to become the man I once was. I need to rebuild myself, get out of this depression and do something with this one life I have to live.

-Just a splash of emotion."

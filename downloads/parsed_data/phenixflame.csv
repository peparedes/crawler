"event","So its been a busy week!

I finally found a job at Blockbuster. All my Hollywood experience paid off, though its only paying $8/hour. That's fine for now. As long as I get enough hours, I think I will be fine. There was two reasons why I wanted to get a part time job, if I couldnt find full-time work. First, I can get money to help pay off my bills and put a bit towards the wedding. Right now, Melissa is paying my bills until I got a job, and now I do. If you know me, you know how much I hate other people paying for me, so basically, her paying my bills for June was absolute torture. Second, I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE. Seriously....

I did get offered another position. I got offered to be a GM (game master) for World of Warcraft. That would be my #1 dream job. I mean come on! Being paid $10/hour and getting raises to play games and help people in the game start out and work out bugs. That=amazing. Only one problem......Its in Austin TX. I couldn't leave Melissa in Madison, waiting for her to come down to Austin and hope to get a job. I mean, if the job was in Chicago, that might be a possibility. But then again, Chicago is only 2 hours away. Austin is a 17 hours away. She needs a job down there. Who knows if that'll ever happen. So I am not getting my hopes up.

In the mean time, I am looking at getting a few things. I decided I don't want to teach. I am planning on going to school to get my A+ certification and then start out getting my programming certifications in .NET and Java. Maybe I can get a job where I will fit in, like a software company instead of somewhere I won't, like a marketing company. I mean, one of the reasons I really want a job as well is to start making friends. When I moved here, I had no friends but Mel. Since I got here, it hasnt improved. I love Melissa, but I really need my own friends that I can talk to face to face. Her friends don't really like me, me thinks. And thats fine. Just strengthens my resolve to find my own friends. 

Melissa told me last night that she can't do any housework around the house because I am around and shes worried that im not being entertained. So, she wants me to leave on saturday so she can clean the house. I guess I'll go out and see a movie. We are going to see WALL-E tonight, so maybe I'll see Wanted tommorrow?"

I have worked every single day of my life since I was 16. No breaks, no ""I quit my job because I hate my manager."" Nothing. I got my degree from W&amp;M, one of the hardest schools in the country. And now, here I am. Jobless in Madison, WI. It is just frustrating sitting on my butt next to my computer doing nothing. I don't know how those professional gamers do it. They sit on the computer in front of World of Warcraft all day playing. I've been doing that for the last month and Im almost sick of the game. ick. 

And its not from lack of trying to find a job either. Here is my laundry list of jobs ive applied for and the result.

Robert Half Technology- (it was a temp agency, as I found out). Offered jobs, but declined. 
American Income Insurance- Offered job, but declined ( I can't work mon- sat 1pm to 10pm. I moved to madison to be with Melissa, and she goes to bed at 10 and gets up at 7....meaning, I would never see her)

Those were the highlights......Now the jobs that declined without an interview.....

Best Buy
Woodmans (like food lion or farm fresh)

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Im actually posting because this has been the first time in about a year that I actually have had time to post. Nuts. So, here I am, in Madison, WI. It's kinda freaky to move in with someone, espicially because I just have this feeling that it is not my house. Melissa assures me it is, but I haven't paid anything into it, so it just doesn't feel like home. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went through student teaching last semester. It was fun, and the kids were mostly great. I am convinced that 90% of your classroom will be great, but you will always have that 10% who just don't care and will make your job a living hell. I am having a huge problem with teaching, tho. Throughout student teaching, I got really high marks for everything, from core knowledge, to building rapport with students, to lesson planning. Everyone kept coming up to me and saying ""you're a natural!"" I just don't feel like teaching is my calling. I got that feeling early in student teaching that it just was NOT what I wanted to do. I just felt awkward the whole time, and maybe its because it wasn't really my classroom, but I just felt like this wasn't what I wanted to do the rest of my life. Maybe my true calling is teaching college? I don't know. I have always wanted to do something with computers, but have always shied away because of my lack of math skills. Perhaps its time to do what my Uncle Richard did and just love history, but go into computers. I'm thinking about taking classes and getting my Master's in computer engineering. It's always been a love of mine, and it'll help me get a job.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of getting a job, I can't get anything in Madison. There are no teaching jobs for Social Studies, no computer tech jobs (I had an interview with Melissa's company but they decided to go in a ""different"" direction), and no part time jobs open yet. So I'm just sitting around, waiting...for something to happen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think one of the hardest things about moving in with Melissa (by the way, I in no way regret moving in with her) is leaving all my friends behind. I think at William and Mary, I had some of the tightest friendships of my entire life. And now they're gone. Clay tells me that we'll never be gone as long as we have IM and everything, but not seeing them on a daily basis hurts. I really miss them and I could use their help now.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Life certainly is funny like that, though. It strikes hard right when you're the most vulnerable. My grandfather has 6 types of cancer (lung, brain, kidney, colon, pancreatic, and lymph). He is terminal and will go any day now. My friends and family are gone, I can't find a job, I'm in an unfamiliar place. I just don't know what to do anymore. The only thing that sustains me is Melissa, and I can't wait until she gets home at 5. 
&nbsp; Planning this wedding is harder than I thought. We have looked at different places and finally chose the Four Seasons. The problem was the alcohol, but I think we have that covered. Now, the only thing I can do for the next 6 months (wedding wise) is save up money and I need one more groomsman. That space is and always is reserved for Chris. I left him a message about 2 weeks ago, and couldn't call him before that because I got a new phone. If Chris says yes, the space is his, if not, I'll leave it empty. 

Just waiting for a job now. Call me or IM me. I'm not doing anything."

"event","&nbsp;So I don't know why, but I always feel like posting when I just have so many things going on in my head that I can't contain it.

1. I guess the first thing that I should write down is that I am dating Melissa. Melissa, in a word, is amazing. I think she is probably the most compatible person to me. Most of my past girlfriends have been a lot like me. I mean, have a lot of the same interests but thats the problem. As Jerry said in Seinfeld, ""I cant date someone like me, I hate myself."" I dont hate myself, but you know what I mean. It is nice to have a person around who does not simply agree with you all the time, or disagrees all the time, or makes you feel inadequate, or insensitive, or unwanted. She loves me for me. She doesnt just love the concept of a boyfriend, she actually genuinely loves me for who I am, and trust me, it is tough to love me. It may seem easy for the first few weeks, but it is like running a marathon.&nbsp;

2. Each semester brings new problems to the table. I have always gotten through semesters by saying something like ""If I just get through this semester, next semester will be cake"" Well folks, next semester is here, and I am failing Geology. Ok, im not failing, but I have a C-. That, in my book is close to failing, bc i dont get the GER for the class if I get a D. This wouldnt be a problem, but I have student teaching next semester, so I cannot fail, or I will have some serious issues next semester. And to be honest, this class and Sci of Nutrition have been the hardest classes for me. I dont get it. I did everything right! I checked ratemyprofessor, I asked around, I took an intro class, I took a class with the least amount of math, and it is AMAZINGLY hard. The professor is ridiculous! she teaches what you dont know, not necessarily what you do know. Its almost like its not an intro class at all. I just want the GER so I can go live my dreams, and they are crashing down around me if I get below a C in this class.&nbsp;

3. PSP. O PSP, I love you and hate you. I love you because of the friendships and how you help me get through the semester. Scott, Laura Cindy, Alyssa, Ryan, Jemma, yall are amazing...even though you cant read this. PSP, I hate you because I chose the wrong semester to take on soo much responsibilty. Hey, I love being Initiate Advisor, but this semeser, I am soo swamped that I cant put in the effort that I want to. It sucks. A lot.&nbsp;

4. Im tired, ill finish this later"

Ive gone through a lot the last 2 years of my life, more than almost anyone will ever go through. Ive done things im not proud of, and I never claimed to be, but Im doing the best I can with what I have. Anyone who disputes that, well they can take it up with me. Im very patient, but I have had it. The only thing I want to be in life is happy, and I'm sorry if some other people blame me for running my life the way I choose. People can talk to me if they want, and although im not the most popular person on campus, I keep myself busy. So whoever has a fucking beef with me, bring it on. Itll probably be the first brave thing theyve ever done in their lives.&nbsp;"

I finally remembered my old password for livejournal! wooo! I tried to do the ""forgot password"" option, but then i never got any of the emails. Turns out, I started livejournal when i was @ temple, and all my ""remember password"" emails were going to my Temple email, that is now not working. CRAZY. 

BUT NOW IM BACK. Don't expect me to post every week. Probably this week because i am at home by myself, but im sure ill have time to post some tidbits once in a while. So whats been going on with me, u ask? Well, Rachel and I just broke up. After&nbsp;months of relationship, her situation just totally wore me down to a nub. It wasn't the long distance exclusively. Ive done long distance before, and I really don't mind it. I've done long distance practically my entire college career. 

The one thing that really does bother me is that I can't seem to hold a relationship together. I mean, I know they think that everything is a-OK, and I do too for a while. I know I dont help matters by not saying anything, but I cant help it. Would u say something if they were having a lot of fun and you werent? My next serious relationship I will not screw up. I know I'm a horrible person for keep breaking up after about a year, but at least im doing it now instead of when Im 40 with 2 children. And like Clay said, IM IN COLLEGE. So its time to slow back down, lay low and have some fun! (but not right now, bc im in va beach eating pretzels and drinking water) And like my dad and sister said, time to STOP DATING PEOPLE THAT I MET IN HIGH SCHOOL.&nbsp;

Now that THAT rant is down, WOOOO FOR SUMMER CLASSES. I have 12 credits I have to go through this summer in order to graduate on time. The school of ed isnt as easy as I thought it would be. OK ill admit it, I thought it would be a cakewalk, like Initiate Advisor for PSP. But I feel compelled to put all this extra work into both of them. Im not becomming a workaholic, trust me, theres nothing Id like to do more than to go over to Jefferson 2nd or Melissa or Patrick or whomever. I just hope that by the end of all this college, I can be proud of what I did, and not remember it for all the mistakes I made =(&nbsp;

On the plus side! My birthday is in 2 weeks! I wasn't really going to drink that much, but my little, and grandbig seem determined to get me drunk (No objections here) I also gave up online games for Lent. Its bad for me. Tho I only play it for about an hour a day, with all this extra time, I really wanna play it. Its gonna take me all my willpower not to. Its ok, I have raking to go do, esp that all my friends in va beach had break last week.

I had a chance to go to Vegas this week. Then I had a chance to go to Philly. I couldnt do either of them bc I had to stay home for a family event. But it got pushed back. So now what am&nbsp;I going to do all week? While I figure it out, Im off"

I thought that tommorrow was oct 1, not today. In effect, i didnt turn in my application to the school of ed on time. Im going to go over tommorrow and see if they will take it. I couldnt get my transcript off banner anyway because of the hold on my account. I hope they take it. I really need this.

I survived last week, but next week is midterm week. It figures that college always puts a huge barrier between u and freedom. I have an exam on mon, tues, and thurs next week. All I have to do is just study and i should be ok. Then im off to Pittsburgh!! wooooohooooo. So excited. Got my plane ticket and everything. Im all stoked.

Friday was awesome. I did soooo many things with so many different people. I went and had dinner with Melissa, which was an exceptionally great meal. Then I went to go see the Illusionist with Laura, which is by far the best movie of the year, in my opinion. It wasnt what i expected, but Paul Giamatti was great and the ending is killer. (literally) But there are still other movies i MUST see in theatre.....

*Jet Li's Fearless
*Hollywoodland
*All the Kings Men
*Flyboys

I doubt i will be bale to tho, because of the amount of money i DONT have.

So anyhoo, as soon as I got back to campus, I went and played risk with Kevin, Donnie, Samrin, Vernon, and Matt. Only took 4 hours but Vernon took over the world, figures. 

Saturday was weird. The first part was pretty good. No traffic going down to va beach, and i got there and my dad wasnt there, so i washed all my clothes. But then, I left my house @ 645 to get back by 8 bc my friends and i were going out to a party when BAM. I hit traffic. I went 5 miles in 4 hours. I started out @ 645, i walked into my room @ 1130. 

The today, my eagles won, but i pulled my groin...and it hurts, a lot. 

Im gonna ace this quiz onh thursday. Granted, i dont have any prior knowledge in bio for at least 3 years, and its a 300 lvl class and there are some words in there i have never ever ever seen, but with a lot of studying, i think i can pull it off.



And today, my Eagles won, but i pulled my groin muscle, and now i have to get it looked @ by a doctor, which really sux. 

Im also convinced im going to fail science of nutrition test on thursday. I did some hardcore studying and i barely knew the terms, much less the answer to the questions. Maybe i can try harder? My GPA cant afford a low grade. 

Im going to go back to my dorm, eat some soup and watch some Simpsons. good stuff"

For the past 2 days, ive been struck down with the Plague. Not the ancient plague that destroyed 1/3 of Europes population or that helped destroy Athens during the Polyponesian War. Its a much worse plague, one where it prevents you from going to class bc u ache badly and cant get up. But luckily, i have a big who brings me soup and oj (thx cindy!!!) and friends who come by to see me (yay melissa!) or friends who call/IM to make sure i dont need anything (chrissy and colby!) =) you guys made me feel a lot better fast.

-Im back @ eswat. Pretty chill tonite, but i didnt bring any homework, so i need to find alternate things to do. I tried to do Science of Nutrition homework, but all for not. I kinda understand it, but i figure if I get lost, i have alex....or laura....or chrissy who can help me, since they all promised to when i said i was going to take a bio class. Now im just collecting on my favors. 

-Both my teams lost in football today. They both lost in OT, the chiefs by a field goal, the eagles by a touchdown. and with that, the tribe lost by 3. just not a good week for football =(

-Finally get to get all the rest of my books. I was trying it the ""melissa"" way of buying all of them one at a time, but having $250 transfered to me really just makes it easier. 

-I cant see crap without my contacts/glasses. I have finally realized this, and have accepted it.

-Cant wait for Fall break when i get to go up to Pittsburgh! U know, I dont usually like Pittsburgh, but I know a ton of really cool people from Pitt and Rachels in Pitt! woooo! I only have 2 midterms in my way tho.

-PSP made $313 at the football game. U figure, @ 4 bucks a pop, thats a lot of money!

-4 hour shifts @ eswat are much longer than 4 hour shifts at Hollywood.

-Unless Colby and I work out a schedule, i fear ill be alone for eating on Tues and Thurs. Its my fault. I changed to Sci of Nutrition, but i really do need that break after Alex the Great. its so hard for my body to get up @ 930 when i usually go to bed @ 230-3 every nite. I need to regulate myself better. I need to tell myself that 230 is fine for MWF bc i only have 1 class, but T/R I need to go to bed @ 1 at the latest. maybe/hopefully thatll help?

"event","Now I remember why I got a livejournal

Well, originally I got a livejournal because my friends at temple said the cool people had a live journal. Of course, I bought into peer pressure. But really doesnt everyone? But the real reason I started it was....a) To procrasinate and b) for me to do something while @ work. I found at Eswat, although we help a lot of people, there is time to actually do homework or even, to write in a livejournal.

Eswat is ok. I have not been getting a lot of tough cases, but thats good! i dont want them. My thurs. 10-12 shift is just me, which means if someone has a really really hard question...i.e., my document wont print or their computer exploded, and i dont know, i dont have big brother to help me out. I mean, in about 2 months, that would be awesome, but right now, i would actually like someone to consult with.

PSP has been awesome so far. Im the fundraising chair, which has been a lot busier than i thought it would be. I have all these days and times to schedule. Kinda sux, but i have been trying to make more friends in there, and i think i am =). If u get a letter, you should come out. Seriously. I could be your big, which may or may not be a good thing =P. Its a lot of fun and im really glad i rushed at temple. Ive never had a little before, but i hope he/she/it is cool. And if not, ill be their big, which wont make them cool by association, but it will at least we can be terribly uncool together.

I love orchestra 2. I dont know if many ppl know this, but i have had a lot of problems this semester. I didnt know if I would make it there for a while. Battling depression, feeling sorry for myself for no reason, and generally making everyone's problems my own. Its hard, esp when u care about the person, to not get involved. Thats why I love orchestra. From 4-6 on Tues and Thurs, I can just leave all my problems at my dorm/class/PSP/work...whatever and just play music. It has got 2 be one of the best desicions i have made this semester.

For some reason, whenever i get back to school, i go through this massive depression where i feel really lonely and like everyone has abadoned me. I just see every having such a good time, and then I see all my friends that dont really talk to me anymore. But you know what, screw them. If they dont wanna talk to me anymore, seriously its their loss. Im tired of trying to get people 2 like me. You know what that does? You introduce yourself or say hi to someone and they think youre a creep, and eventually, everyone on campus thinks youre a creep. And for a little while, i thought i was the biggest creep on campus. I dont know if i woulda made it without my friends...rachel, amir, melissa, louise, cindy, laura, clay, kalyn, josh, alex, vern, gilda, kevin basically everyone on jefferson 2nd. You guys sincerely are the best. When i was at my worst, you were @ your best. None of you can probably read this, but whatever. Its my journal so i can write whatever i want.

And i know its awkward because I know shell read this, but i really dont care. I need to get this out. Last week I found out that chrissy had a boyfriend. And you know what. Im cool with it. Ok, ill be honest, I didnt know how to quite respond when i first saw it on facebook, and a little sad she didnt share it with me. But its her life, she can determine what she tells people and what she doesnt. And after talking it over with a good friend, i realized that in the end, it is what makes her happy. If she likes this guy and gushes over him like a little school girl, im happy that she found someone that makes her feel that way. Yeah I could sit here and be like....ooooo thats not fair, she didnt tell me....blah blah blah. But im, in the end, still her friend, right? I need to be there for her when this jerk makes her angry (and he will if he mentions penguins), or to laugh when he tells a funny joke. (even if he tells funny joke,  itll never be quite as funny as the deer joke).  

Wow this is a long post (it took 40 min to write all this, but its a lot of info!!!) You know, now that I write it all down, I really do have a good life. Sometimes, I think, when everything is going bad and life gets you down, it is really hard to just step back and say, hey, my life is actually pretty good. I started out this post feeling kinda bad. Things seem to be overpowering. Now, I think I can wake up, go to Tudor England, get lunch with my PSP family, tour zable for the football game tomm, and then relax.

O and if any of the people who can read this wanna catch lunch on MWF after 12p or Tues/Thurs btw 11-1230, just let me know. Ill eat by myself, but i would rather have someone to eat with.

1) I dont get work, just when i think i figure it out, it throws me a curve ball. Last week, I worked 12.5 hours. The week before, 7. Now, Ive worked the last 8 days in a row. And to boot, I have 2 days off, and then i have another 5 days in a row. I dont mind the hours at all, as i need money. But make it a little more consistent than the bi-polarness I have right now. Because of these crazy hours, I think ive seen about 3 of my friends in the last 2 wks. That needs to change. Im starting to get cabin fever. SO if you are living in Va Beach, give me a call or IM me @ phenixrevelation. Im up for pretty much anything.

2. Superman comes out today! boooo ya. I didnt go see it tonite because i have no one to see it with (thats in va beach) I dont wanna drive up to williamsburg and then have to work tomm. (i open). BUT i am off fri and sat. So ppl have ur cells ready, ur getting a call. haha.

3. Im going to go to philly in about 2 weeks. I originally was gonna go July 14-16, but my friend brits party is july 29, so im wondering if i just should go then?

4. Macbeth.....at PBK......july 6th.....ill be there.

5. Ugh ive only gotten to see 2 concerts this summer. Need MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE. (Note: though NIN and Bauhaus concerts were great, theres gotta be some cool things coming)

6. As I do work @ Hollywood Video, check out these movies:
16 Blocks
Freedomland
The Producers
Pink Panther(cheap laugh)
Syriana
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
Everything is Illuminated
Running Scared
Good Night, and Good Luck
Memoirs of a Geisha (not as good as the book, but cinematography is great)
The Worlds Fastest Indian
You Me and Everyone we know
Up and Down
Hoodwinked (i actually kinda sorta in a way, maybe, liked it)

7. Dad comes home tomm from Honduras. OMG i cant find his fathers day gift. For fathers day, I found a picture of me and him and I got it framed. Well, the frame broke, and I cant find the picture! sigh....i guess ill find him gift. Maybe Tides tickets. Now that he has been gone so long, Ive been able to try out new recipes that i havent been able to bc dad buys all the food. I made shrimp gumbo last nite and beef stew the previous. I think ill do chicken a la king tonite. Never had it in my life. I need some fruit. I think im gonna get scurvy. We ran out yesterday. 

8. 1 month till nags head and everyone knows what that means....."

I broke up with chrissy today. I didnt do it out of malice, or because I hate her, or because my dad forced me, or bc someone forced me. I did it because i think itll be the best thing for both of us in the long run. I just cant commit the kind of emotional and mental output that is needed for a relationship right now. I really wish people could understand my motives, but i prob will get that ""hate"" IMs or the ""explain why"" IMs that i hate so much. I did it, why do you need a why? I feel horrible. I feel like the lowest kind of existance. Its so bad that I dont even feel like im here. But I know it would be worse if I stayed. Sure, things would have been fine for a few more months, at least we got back to W&M, and it may start out with an arguement, and it will escalate, and escalate, and then we would break up and wouldnt even be able to be around her anymore. I dont want that. Like chrissy, Im just sad right now, not because i want her back, because that would be a mistake, but because it was over so quickly, for so much time and emotion we both invested in it. 

Also I put up an away message. Ive never had such a response to my away b4 (i didnt even know ppl stalked my profile THAT much) It said RIP David and Chrissy and 1/4/05-5/29/06. For some odd reason, ppl thought this was insensitive. I dont get it. I didnt mean it that way. I didnt know how quite to tribute our relationship. I wasnt rubbing it in that I broke up. I wanted a tribute for the public on a good, long lasting relationship, at least for me. 

I dont expect ppl to understand why i did it. And i already feel like a jerk. Im going away for a few days. Hopefully chrissy and i will feel better when i get back.

And chrissy, like you said, ""We'll Always Have Philly"" shes right, we had some great times. I choose to remember that."

Well I quit my job at Yorktown/Jamestown. I walked in and they were really happy to have me on board. But then I got the training schedule and they wanted me to work 40 hours a week for the first 2 months and then approx. 35 hours after that. That would be good if I were OUT of college or a grad student, but im still an undergrad. Im taking 15-18 credits a semester. Anything over 15 hours a week simply is not going to work for me, unless its hollywood video, then I can do about 22.5 hours a week (since thats what I was working last semester.....still bitter)So i told them hell no. I interviewed for the associate position here at the library. Hopefully ill get it. I would like an on-campus job to decrease the amount of gas I have to use.

Speaking of Hollywood Video, Ill be back in VA beach for the summer. I dropped my 6 credits of summer school and heading back. There just isnt any point to staying and basically wasting 3000 on 6 credits (although....it may be relaxing) So im off to work this summer. Its going to be fun. I know enough people that will be down there that could be fun. plus im doing nags head again this summer, (family reunion) how can that NOT be fun =P. 

Sat. is lottery. Amir and I have to decide where were living. He has to get all the holds off his account first, which he said hes doin today. Its going to be awesome living with him next year. I think were doin Bryan complex, but still not sure. 

My schedule is basically set except for one class. its my fifth and final class that keeps changing. Im trying to figure out if i wanna take my GER 2 or not. If I do, Ill be doing 3 GERs next sem, 1 more than i would like to do, but o well. heres the schedule if anyone wants to see

The Age of Absolutism (this will be fun, my fav professor+Colby and Kati)
Tudor England (As of right now, Nikita, Lynne, Colby, and Kati)
Alexander the Great (only me, but ill gladly exchange this class for human sex)
Math Powered Flight (GER 1.....math needs to die!!!!!!!!!)
Intro to Psych as a Nat. Sci. (GER 2, this one keeps changing everyday)
Cello IV (GER 6 and one credit)

I had induction and revelation for PSP. Cindy's my big! WOOOOO. Im really happy cause i prefed her #1. shes actually one of the ppl who wanted me to update and put something about her in my jounral. so cindy, this is for u. even though theres no mention of me in your profile/facebook/wherever. it means shes ashamed of me! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!my family is awesome, my top 2 prefs and 3 of the 7 are in my family. its great. I worry that maybe people dont like me in the frat, but as long as I have friends and people to talk to, im not too concerned. 

Last weekend was formal weekend. Really nice. Not much to say about it. I had to wear a suit everyday all weekend =( But i did learn how to tie a tie! If you want to see pics, they are on my facebook. (generally bc i dont know how to post pics on here) 

I know ive been kinda a hermit in dillard for the last week, but i only have 2 more papers to go, and then i can relax until finals. One is due fri, the other on tues. wish me luck

Ok, ull prob lose interest in this entry long before you read this, so everyone.....have a good day/night!"

haha. i love my friends, absolutely the best. I got back to my room last nite to find I had 6 IMs already saying happy bday (hurray for Louise, Brit, Glo, Nikita, Chrissy, and John) then Christina Rarick woke me up @ 7am to say happy bday, and then I got IMs throughout the day, and i checked my mail @ 2, to find i had 22 new messages....all from facebook and myspace. craaazzzzy. I played pool with amir. It was great. Im really glad I asked him to be my roomate next year. I think were going to live in the Bryan complex next semester, tho im not quite sure. I think i have seen every single last person on this campus that I know today. and all of them said happy bday. I am on cloud 9 right now. Plus Lynne gave me the Spamalot album. Steph sent me an E car.Excellent, Excellent. SO now im in the library, gettin money! hurray! and the only way to end tonite is for midnight frisbee NOT to be canceled. Heres hoping

But as Cole reminded me last nite, the awkward years continue until your out of college, making 20 even lesser of an event. But, for the last 2 hours, ive been listening to the who's Baba O'Reily (Teenage Wasteland). So ill be out of the Teenage Wasteland.

Saw Casablanca tonite @ Reves. Now more than ever, Humphrey Bogart is the man. How awesome he is. Now that I think about it, all those old actors, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Montgomery Cliffe, Gregory Peck, Spencer Tracey, Peter Fonda, Peter Louree, they were all ""the man."" And they didnt need to change their names to be ""the man"" either. Im on to you, Vin Diesel. I mean, look at Humphrey Bogart, he didnt take crap from anyone. If any Nazi stood in his way, BAM, they were dead, just like that. There were no ""Ben Affleck"" or Heath Ledger (there were no ""I dont know how to quit you"" lines, only imaginary Bunnies named Harvey). I dont know, it just seems like the quality of movies has seriously tanked. Its gone from movies like Mr Smith goes to Washington to Mr. and Mrs. Smith....from To Kill a Mockingbird to Snakes on a Plane. *shakes head* for shame...modern movies. Go back to being good. I mean the only good movie out now, (seriously) is V for Vendetta. Everything is can be burned and no one would know the difference.

I have offically withdrawn out of summer school. Not really my fault, unless you count not having any money to go my fault. Ill just make up the credits later. I mean, all i was going to take was Math and my colloqium requirement, but I guess I dont have to worry about that now. Ive pretty much figured out my classes for next semester.....

Medieval History I (3)
Age of Absolutism (3)
Human Sexuality (3)
Physical Geography OR Nutrition (depends on how I feel at the time)(3)(GER2)
French and Lab (4)
Cello III (1)
total 17
alternative: The Crusades.

I dont need Human Sexuality or French, but I have 4 semesters left at William and Mary and I figure I have 4 GER requirements to do, so all I have to do is one a semester. Im trying to finish my history requirements as well because Next Year, I have to start my Education requirements, and thats gonna eat a lot of my time. Right now I just need credits. I figured that in order to graduate on time without going to summer school, I would have to take 18 credits 3 out of my last 4 semesters, with only one semester as a 15 credit load. I figure I can alleviate it next year with summer school, I just cant afford to pay $600 for a dorm, and $300 per credit hour. Its just 2 much! (it ends up being about 3000 for summer school)

Well, im not going to go into parking services until they email me back

Last nite was a lot of fun. First I went to Aromas with PSP, and I got to talk to some brothers who may potentially be my big. haha Its pref week, and then next week is clue week. Who do I want? NO idea. But during it, my friend Mark was like, u wanna go bowling, only a buck. So i was like sure, why not. So we went with 2 of his roomates and a PSP brother, connie. Only, when we got to the bowling place, we found out that it was so crowded that we could not even get a lane, so were like screw this. So we went to a pool place, called the Corner Pocket. I actually held my own. Not 2 bad. 

SO we get back, and its already midnight, and when I get in, my roomate tells me that John, from down the hall, was looking for me and was upstairs. I go up and wanted to know if I wanted to play poker. I had played online poker, but actually poker is so much different. Its like, everyone is profiling you, looking for some sort of telle which they can exploit against you. Well, it ended up that im a pretty honest player. I bluffed a few times, and they called me on it a few times. I got John out of the game, and almost got this other guy, chris, out too. But my luck ran out and lost about 5 games in a row. It was finally 2 am, and it was the last hand. I went all in and won the last pot. I won $3.25, but hey, the buy in was $2, so I had a net profit 1.25,which was great on my first time at actual poker.

Tonight is Spades nite. Leo and I won last week. Lets see how we fare this week.

Its not that hard(laptops), but I keep forgetting to bring something to do, ie Homework. Good thing my French history professor puts all of his reading material online.

So what was my weekend like? Well, I went out with chrissy on fri nite. We worked a lot of things out, which is excellent. I know a lot of people were pullin for us. I dont know, with out her, i just felt like a loser all the time. I know now im not a loser, but it just felt that way. 

Anyway, I went to TDX, went to a bartending class, went to Phi Sigma Pi formal, but the most fun was tonite. Im not saying those WERENT fun, bc they were, but this was fun bc it was my grandmothers 75th bday. It was great half my family was there, talking, laughing, telling stories AND i got to see my sister. I forgot how much fun i really have with my family. I was so sad to leave, but I had to go to work, bc i need $$$$, namely for my PSP dues. 

I hope that the tow truck picks up my old car soon. I just got a $105 fine on it, that although im appealing it, it has the potential to cost me. Its not fair at all. Its not like i can move the car, bc tit is in the parking lot....disabled. Its also not fair! i never have ANY MONEY. As soon as i get it, i have like.....8 million things tht come up that i have to pay for. I just got my refund check for 200 and my paycheck for 200 and as soon as i get it, I have insurance, this fine, gas, PSP dues, family dinner, oil for the ex-car. I was actually looking foward to building up some capital. Now i def cant until at LEAST the summer. The last time i actually had a little money was xmas, when i managed to build up about $300. But before u say 1...2...3, its gone.

Note: GEORGE MASON is in the final four! Now that i acknowledge that, they are going to lose....just watch. 

why is life so confuzing? Just when i think i have it right, it changes....ahhh the way the world works....

only 4 days to my bday. i guess im excited. i dont know. i wont be until thurs....when i wake up. i hope ppl remember. i dont know what i wanna do, but im sure itll be this weekend. My dad is coming up thurs, and chrissy is taking me out to dinner on fri @ 6.

Well i was just shelf reading, like for the last hour and for those of u who have never shelf read before, it is probably one of the most boring activities known to man. Like, if there is a hell specifically for librarians, then all of them will be shelf reading for all of eternity. ANYWAY, when i shelf read and i do not have my MP3 player around (i think i really lost it this time, just not ""misplaced"" it) I usually think about the day. This is a change because I usually only think in the shower. (more than most of u need to know) So i realized, life is way too short to complain about it all the time. And all i do on Livejournal is complain....just everyday. 

I had a dream last nite, and its funny bc i almost always forget mine. Well, I remembered this one, and I was a secret agent, and i was shot and killed and guess who killed me.....Why I got shot by Colby, I have no idea, but I was a secret agent nonetheless. ANYWAY!!!!! I realized that if I died, then all ppl would remember is that I satr around and complained about life instead of living it. Im wasting away thinking about all the BAD things and what I shoulda done, and not focusing what i AM doing. and its screwing me up. But i realized that i cant go in alone. Im afraid of what the future might bring, but im glad that I have the best friends in the world to go it in with me....even colby, even though she killed me in my dream (which was soooo weird)

SO if ur doing something over the weekend, let me know. If ur not doing something let me know. If you just wanna talk, give me a call. If u want to take a random road trip to richmond, give me a call. If you dont WANT to give me a call, then......um....leave me a message. I dont want to go on being a bastard to everyone. Esp. with my bday coming up. Its time to start a new decade of my life with some purpose. This will prob be the most important 10 years of my life. But im glad that when i start it off, all of u will be apart of it, even if it doesnt seem like it sometimes 

PS i will prob only complain about class now. THATS A BIG STEP

Then things got bad. When i got to PSP, I got there late and saw no one i knew, so i basically just floated around. And it got out early, so I went to WM, and got there early, aka I was bored, so I was like, Ill sit in the corner where I usually sit until more ppl show up. So I got there, and again, like PSP I saw alone. What is it with people????!??!? do i have rabies or something. So I got a call during the meeting about a family problem that im not going to disclose on the internet, bc this isnt very secure. So....that got me really depressed....like....fast....and then i had to go to work after receiving this news, I had to go to work. Bummer. 

So now i feel horrible. I mean first, sitting alone. Alright I get it, im an annoying person. Sorry, I didnt know just how annoying or uncomfortable i made ppl in WM and PSP. Maybe i should just stop talking altogether, but when i did that at the library, ppl were like, WHY ARNT U HAPPY. what is it with ppl? ppl dont like me happy....they dont like me quiet or upset, or anything. What do i have to do? drink like.....20 beers in row? do I have to be unintelligent?

I had a pretty blah day. Im figuring out that, although MWF's are pretty standard, they get kinda boring. I mean.....I wake up, shower, go to class till 2, eat at the UC with Colby, go back to dillard and lay around for 3 hours, go to dinner, go back to dillard and study and get all my work done, and then go to the library, go back to dillard and go to sleep.....repeat. It kinda sux, but thats what i do every single MWF. And now my Tues/Thurs are starting to become the same thing. Its a brutal cycle. Ive tried to add some zest into my schedule....like Midnight Frisbee, and CTF on Wed, but other attempts at doing thigns just dont work out for assorted reasons. Even like...a random movie or walk around CW, or streaking the Sunken Gardens would be a welcome change. I dont know. I know ppl are busy and I am 2. It would just be great tho, to have someone call me and BAM say hey, were goin out to *insert place here* wanna go. O well. 
Other than that, ive been doing pretty good. Its probably just this week talking. I mean, Monday was sooo bad, that its resonating thru the week. Hopefully, if i can get to the weekend, Ill feel better.

I got up and I was amazed that I was actually able to get up early. And the funny thing is I felt refreshed which was even MORE strange. I knew something was up immediately. Despite this strange feeling i decided to go to James Blair. When I went in I found that the teacher wasnt there, and there was a sub. This sucked because I wanted to explain to the teacher that I had been sick the last 2 weeks and that was why I wasnt there the week b4 spring break. I sent her an email, but she didnt respond, leading me to think that she was slightly upset by this. So i went there and she wasnt there. I was about to leave, because I wasnt needed (and I couldve used the extra 4 hours of sleep) but the sub asked if I wanted to be the teacher bc I had more exp than she did with the class. I didnt mind, esp. bc the more teaching exp I have, the better. So wouldnt u know it, the kids were TERRIBLE, absolutely HORRIBLE today. No matter how interesting I tried to make the class, it just sucked monkey. Half the reason is because I DIDNT EVEN KNOW I WAS TEACHING UNTIL I GOT THERE. Anyhoo, So 2 boys in particular tried to make my life a living hell, and I was having NONE of it. So I had them see me after class, and after talking to them and setting them straight, I decided to recommend to give them a detention. At the time, another teacher agreed to do the detention with me, bc as a teacher asst, i have no real authority and plus I have no insurance (aka parents bitching at me). So i scheduled the detention at 4, and soon afterward....the sub was like... ""o i can handle the class from here, you can go now. I assume she didnt like the tough attitude I had with the kids, but these are MIDDLE SCHOOL kids, not elem. If they sense any kind of weakness, theyll take it. So she dismissed me. So i left, but i forgot my bag. When I went back in, the kids were WAY out of control, but sux for her. She dismissed me.
So i left and went to class where I learned that I got an 88 on an exam I swore I aced. I mean, im not POed that I got an 88. That would be stupid beyond a belief. Im mad bc the stuff he took off for was SOOOO minor and nit picky that even Colby was like.....uh.....thats just wrong. And i rushed to get the essay done for his class and what happens, he extends the deadline. Sure, I dont have to do it now, but I wasted Sat. for nothing when I coulda gone out with friends and done something productive...and he extends it. Unbelievable. 
SO i went to lunch, which was the only really nice time i had today. Colby and I talked for a while, and i vented, but stuff was still to come. I left and prepared to go to the detention, but I got a call from James Blair saying that I could not legally assign detention bc i was not a teacher, even though I had a teacher there with me. So thats just great, now everytime i teach, im gonna have those kids KNOWING that they can walk all over me because they know i cant do anything about it. So i have to go into the Principals office tommorrow and ""explain"" my actions. Explain what??? that im maintaining discipline in the classroom? whatever.
So then I was supposed to go to dinner with Lynne and Nikita, but Lynne had a family dinner, and Nikita didnt get back to me in time (before I went to dinner) I met up with 3 friends (Clay, Pete and Kalyn). That made me upset bc it was the one part of my day that i was looking foward to because when i really need to vent, I usually talk to Lynne and Kita or chrissy. But they couldnt and its not their fault. Just NOTHING IS GOING right today. And now im trying to talk 2 somebody...ANYBODY online AND NO ONE IS HERE SO I CANT VENT. So now i have to go on lj and do it. And its freaking 87 degrees in my room with no breeze and no AC, my roomie just fell asleep and its 930, so i have to be quiet.............I AM SO FRUSTRATED. Im just going to sit in my room for the rest of the night and pray to GOD this day ends....like soon. For those of u who had to be around me today, Im sorry if i upset you. I hope the above helps u out why I was that way. And if i did talk to you about this, thanks for listening....i really do appreciate it."

Im in the library and I only have 5 more min on the computer until I have to go back to shelving. That stinks. I havent even been back to my dorm yet tonite, which kinda stinks because all my stuff is still in the car. Hopefully it wont get stolen b4 I get back to my dorm! AHHHH.

So I have 2 hrs of shelving. I miss spring break. Even though it seems now like i didnt really do that much, I could still go for doing absolutely nothing for a few more......weeks. Now I have to worry about Russian History, and all my other classes. Grrrrr. O well, at least I have my friends around so I may share my pain with them as well. Alright then. I am off to shelving. Ill be back in my dorm about.......1230. Give me an IM or call, or an email, or a voicemail, or a snail mail.....then."

I mean come on, I work during school and for the last 4 years. I need a break. And I finally got one from everything....and now Im bored. there has GOT to be a happy median in which im not 2 bored, but im not too overexerted. I know other ppl feel the same exact way. We sit here and say ""i cant wait for break...i cant wait for break..."" and what happens, break comes and we are As Bored As Hell.  But nothing can help that. Ive done some really great things this break. I went to Hampton to see Lynne and Nikita (well get another cake guys), I went out with my friends Josh, Stephanie, and Lachelle, I saw Colby and Rach, did stuff with Chrissy, and it was actually warm on thurs and friday. I did forget to see my mom......... 
         My birthday is in less than 3 wks. I wonder what ill get. I dont expect that much. My bday last year was fun, and I got to celebrate it with my PSP brothers and my friends at temple. I wish i got to go to w&m in the fall so i would know more ppl to celebrate my bday with. But you know what. I love the people who i met at orientation. I mean come on, Nikita, Louise, Meg, Amir, Sarah, Justin,Doug, Annie, where else could i have gotten to meet them? Exactly....no where. Im really happy at W&M I decided. The people are great, I love the colonialness of Williamsburg, although I would prefer it to be Europe instead of America. Way better than ODU. 
         Well Im off to do work. I need to finish this paper bc its due on Monday....grrrr to u Professor Olsen. Cant wait to see everyone again....and COME OUT TO MIDNIGHT FRISBEE"

     It started at bad and got worse. It started out with a stupid comment that I made to Lynne that got her (sorta)upset. She forgave me, but it just set the tone for the rest of the day. I wanted to study, but I had a football game @ 3, which we lost 41-0 because 4 of our good players didnt show up and it was freezing outside. 
     Then I went to lunch with colby and chris, but no one talked during the whole lunch.....and i only get to see chris once every 5-7 months. I know colby is his girlfriend and all, but im his best friend! dont I get more than an hour when he comes to visit? Obviously not. I was hoping we would get to spend some time on Monday, but he said flat out ""colby wants to spend monday with me"" I mean, damn boy, she spent all nite fri, all day sat, sun, mon, and some of tues....and i get an hour....totally unbelievable. So i just didnt try. I mean, come on, when I was in Philly and I had just come home from school and I only had 2 weeks to be with chrissy b4 she went back up to school, and 2 weeks with chris, I totally evened it out. Guess when you have a girlfriend, nothing else matters =(

     So yeah, and then I had PSP pinning, and that wasnt that bad. I got to meet a ton of ppl that i hadnt before, although i only spent about 3 min total talkin 2 my big bc hes the historian. And then chrissy and i got into a huge fight. We worked it out.....but still.....

      And throughout all that i spent an hour total studying for my midterm.

      Will this day never end?

Off to James Blair tommorrow, and then hopefully some studying b4 the midterm."

I have to work tommorrow at James Blair from 7-11 then have lunch with the brothers from 11-12 then class from 12-2. THEN instead of sleep which i really really need, im working on the stupid ivan paper. Its probably going to eat a good 6 hours of my life (from what i hear) and right after that.....its back to the library!!! yay! (not really) The only real good thing is that thurs morning, i can sleep in bc i have nothing until 2 pm. Ill use this as finishing Ivan if necessary, but mostly, itll be for sleep. And when i come back from class, more sleep....(ur seeing a trend, i hope). After picking up my best friend on friday, i have NO idea what im doing this weekend. So give me your calls, your IMs, cause i wanna celebrate the fall of Ivan..... and no work

I dont plan on doing it on thurs, but just in case I need the extra time. 

Rent was pretty good, except the mics kept on going out, which sucked for the ppl in the back, but not for us because we got 5th row seats. Booo yea. I was reading, but i fell asleep @ 430 and magically woke up about 15 minutes ago, just in time for my library shift. (yipee,<------note sarcasm). Im gonna bring Ivan to the library with me

Sorry this entry is mostly about Ivan, but its taking over my life....ick. It snowed yesterday 2. But it didnt really stick, which i woulda liked to have Presidents Day off, but it didnt stay. *sigh* o well. Im off to the library, and then back to the Dill to do some more work."

I dont know, i just felt really lonely today for no reason at all. Maybe it was me walking across campus all alone today, or no one calling me for dinner, or the lack of finding a really good friend on campus. I just wish I meant something to someone besides Chrissy. I havent felt that way since I left Temple. I guess thats why I miss it so much. I mean, I know a lot of People, (look at facebook) and I have chrissy, but I havent found that 1 person that I can really connect with besides chrissy. I dont know, It just feels that everyone has someone else that they hang with all the time. For example, Chrissy has Sasha, Colby has Noel, Lynne has Nikki, Kalyn has Josh........Also, when people joked with me, Usually im fine with it and joke back, but today I took them more to heart. *sigh*

Hell, the History Channel devotes entire programs to just his death, but it ended up being boring.....just like the class. Its sad that 3 of 5 of my classes our history based, but only 1 really intrigues me. My French history class, i thought it was goin to be boring bc its all social history and im more of a military and diplomatic history person, but its all the professor. Im gonna ask him to be my advisor, hes that good. 

I really love my TAing at James Blair. Teaching kids is awesome. Disciplining sucks. BUT ive learned more in the last week about teaching than i did during my Practicum. These kids are great. So much that I asked if I could do it next year =)

First I woke up too late to get to James Blair, so I said I was still reeling from being sick, which I kinda am, so i wasnt lying, just exagerating the truth. So i got up late to get to the Library, so I said What the Hell, ill take a shower, so I took a shower. So then I got to the library by like.....15 min late, and I was too late to take my shelving test. So that sucked so I went online and emailed off my last 2 syllabi to the transfer lady who (surprise) didnt email me back about it....I hope she got it. So then i went to class and discovered....hey Im hungry....but i couldnt get ne food bc i had to be back at the library for 2:00 training. So i thought i wasnt going to have any time to turn in my OA application, but i ran to the campus center and ran over to the library (aka I was able to turn in my application) and made it to the library on time. I went through my final training and amazingly I HAVENT EATEN YET AND IM STARVING

But Meg texted me in class and the ""group"" is going off to eat....but i havent had anything and it is now 530. ick, chrissy is gonna kill me, if starvation doesnt kill me first. 

And thats not even the end of the night.....apparently im gonna go off to PARTAY tonite.

This is probably just as exhausting to read as i am right now

Whatever, Im gonna go to the cafe early and eat and they can join me........"

My Sinus's drained and started to affect my asthma, i have it under control though, and should be much better by tommorrow.

Its funny, but you always know who really cares about you when youre sick. Even if it is just a single IM saying ""hope you feel better."" It really made me feel better, it really did. So to all of you who actually said it, thanks, u are my true friends.....and if u didnt....for shame (or u didnt read my away message, and in that case, i forgive u)

Also Ive been getting a lot of IMs from my Phi Sigma Pi chapter in philly. Is there something with Febuary and people viewing my profile? haha. I really do miss all of them up there. If they read this, then they know im comin up there, probably in april when i have some money....so get ready.

My conducting class is the easiest and the hardest class. Its the easiest because it has no grade except the final, but the hardest bc im behind on music theory.....thank u jabba....

So here I am in Williamsburg at the College of William and Mary. I now have $50 in my name, and no job b/c I got a job, but the College decided i have to have a Social Security card in order to work bc obviously proof of my birth, a drivers license and a passport arnt enough (assholes). So yeah, ive met up with a few awesome people here. Chrissy, of course, is awesome and doing great. Going on a year and a month starting.....yesterday...and were gonna see Rent on the 18th, which should be awesomeness. Shes right, it is better the second time around =)

Im out in the Forbidden Zone known as ......Dillard. Its approx 3 miles off campus...so for Temple equivalent....its like living in Franklin, except its in the middle of the woods, so we have roaches. I have my car...(aka the money drainer). Some awesome people here include.....colby.....i guess. haha, we have a class together, which is a little weird bc we are ex-bf and gf, but whatever, its fun. I met this guy Amir in Dillard, but hes moviing into the Psi Up lodge, so hell be away from dillard. Louise is totally awesome, as is Annie and Meg. I made friends with 2 international students, Steffan and Leo. These guys are awesome and Leo actually went to ODU with me and may room with me next year, which is great. Kalyn is a great person to hang with 2, but shes always going over to Jefferson! And last, but certainly not least, Lynne and Nikita. These guys are totally awesome, probably 2 of the most interesting people ive met here and lets just say....they have big plans for the world. (and im involved)

I dont think my roomie likes me at all. Apparently he went to Kemps Landing, and he plays World of Warcraft all the time. I mean, i play it 2 (maybe an hour a day?) but every time i come in....hes on it! does he do work???? nope

I got a subbing job @ james blair and a teacher aide job. Itll be great.....on the education fast track.

<TD>Ioseb Jughashvili (1879-1953) was expelled from seminary school in 1899 and turned to the Georgian Communist Party, where he got the nickname ""Stalin."" His rise to power is a classic example of political cunning. He was a mere bureaucrat when Lenin died in 1924, but he used party appointments, infighting, and secret police so well that by 1936, he was unquestionably the leading man in the USSR. His personal brand of Communism emphasized heavy industry and high body counts: historians believe he was responsible for eight to twenty million deaths, not counting the additional twenty million killed in World War II. The full extent of his terror was not known for years after his death, and many prominent Western intellectuals were fooled by Stalin's brilliant propaganda machine. Like Stalin, you believe in ""out of sight, out of mind."" If somebody is bothering you, you'll be a lot happier if you get them away from you, so why not have them exiled, killed, or better yet, erase their very existence? It's only a small step from cropping your exes out of prom photos to removing them entirely from the history books. </TD></TR>

"event","<P><FONT color=#000000>Im really kind of bored here in the library I dont really have much to do because i have a two hour break, and no one i know has lunch at the same time I do. THIS SUCKS! So without further adooo.......Im presenting my Best Films of the Half Year! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=5><STRONG>Best Picture:</STRONG> <STRONG>Batman Begins</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>Runner Up: Cinderella Man</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=5><FONT size=3>By far the best movie this year has got to be Batman Begins, for the simple fact that the last 2 Batman's blew monkey, and this one was good. And when I say good, I mean great. It had a good combo of action and drama. It didnt try to make Batman Campy, like the last two did. In fact, since Tim Burton and Michael Keaton stopped doing Batman, it has gone from bad to worse. Batman, in the new movie, doesn't even show up until half way through the movie. We find out where Batman gets all this gadgets (from Morgan Freeman, of course, who has been in every other movie this year), how he learned all his martial arts moves (from Liam Nieson of course, who learned them from Rob Roy), and How his parents died, finally&nbsp;(not in clouded afterthoughts) It was well directed, well acted, and gave a new sense of villans. They are redoing the series and although I love jack Nicholson as the Joker, im ready for a new one if it means a great movie. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Cinderella Man was a great movie about the Depression and one mans struggle to come to terms with the reality of his situation to get one more fight to put food on the table. It is a great tale of survival and the endurance of the Human soul. Russell Crowe, again, is amazing in it and should get an Oscar Nod.</P>
<P><STRONG>Best Action Movie:</STRONG> Batman Begins</P>
<P><STRONG>Runner Up: </STRONG>Ong-Bak: Thai Warrior</P>
<P>For Batman Begins, see above</P>
<P>With marvelous movies like Sin City and The Island (roll eyes here) how can Ong-Bak, a foriegn movie be best Action movie. Because, its a martial arts movie with not many special effects and pure action. It doesnt have the Beauty of&nbsp;a movie like Crouching Tiger or House of Flying Daggers, but it does have Wing-Chun style combantants, and plus, there hasnt been a good Martial Arts movie, in my opinion, in a while. (Sorry Mark, War of the Worlds didnt make the list)</P>
<P><STRONG>Best Comedy:</STRONG> <STRONG>Wedding Crashers</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Runner Up: Mr &amp; Mrs. Smith</STRONG></P>
<P>Wedding Crashers is by far the FUNNIEST movie of the year. Forget Guess Who, or the Longest Yard or whatever stupid David Spade movie came out this year. This movie is just plain funny. Im not a huge fan of Vince Vaughn since Dodgeball (although it was pretty funny) and Owen Wilson isnt too funny either, though he was hilarious in Zoolander, but it was still Ben Stiller who stole the movie. This movie starts as 2 men crash weddings strictly to sleep with women. They have rules and they have it down to a science. All until Owen Wilsons character falls for this chick during a high class wedding. All through the movie are sex jokes (Did u motor boat?) and strictly non-sex jokes (Why do we have to wear camaflouge?) But whether you see it with your girl, or you see it alone, one thing is certain.....SEE IT.</P>
<P>Mr &amp; Mrs. Smith is one of those movies you have to see with a significant other. The way these two interact is just so like married couples. In fact, it is my belief that if all people were secret agents, that this is probably the way they would end up.</P>
<P><STRONG>Best Science Fiction: War of the Worlds</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Runner Up: Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</STRONG></P>
<P>War of the Worlds was a pretty good interpretation of the book. I was impressed, not only with Tom Cruise, but also with Dakota Fanning. The Special Effects for this movie were great, and will win it a Nod for the Oscars. A lot of people thought that the end cooped out, but hey, thats the way H.G. Wells intended, although im sure they could have done a lot more with the ending. But then again, what do you want with a summer movie. The best scene in the movie wasnt any special effect, but was the battle on the hill, and you know something is going on over the hill, but you dont know what. A brilliant piece of directing in an age where everyone must show everything (see horror movies for this example) </P>
<P>Star Wars finally got it right this year. I dont know if it was the set up from the previous 2 movies or the fact that Jar Jar Binks was no where in the movie. George Lucas finally cut out all the racial and children movie crap from the movie, gave haydn christianson some acting skills, and turned out a good 3 and a half star movie. Everything that had to come together did. You see Yoda vs the Emperor, a fight waiting to happen, Obi Wan vs Darth Vader...Rd. 1. How Anakin turns to the dark side, why Luke and Leia are kept from Anakin and the reason all the Jedi die out. It kind of is a quick way to kill all of the jedi, the way it happened, but there wasnt any other real way to do it. The lightsaber battles are more than enough of a reason to see this movie. That and seeing Sam L. and his badass purple lightsaber.</P>
<P><STRONG>Best Horror/Suspense Movie</STRONG>:<STRONG> Hostage</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Runner up: Hide and Seek, Red Eye</STRONG></P>
<P>Hostage did the trick. Its&nbsp;a smart suspense that keeps you guessing the whole way through. You dont know how its going to work out, if Bruce Willis can get out with his family intact, why the robbers chose that house....etc. It seems confusing, with all the different questions that need to be answered, but thats the mark of a good Suspense movie.</P>
<P>Before I get into these next two, let me give u my opinion on Horror movies. They suck. There hasnt really ever been a good horror movie in year (Since the Ring and before that, who knows) Horror movies have been reduced down to the Boogeyman concept...ok beginning and then sux at the end. To be honest, I can only think of 3 good modern horrors, The Mothman Prophesy, The Ring, and Idenity, and Idenity was ok until the end. It, like Saw, was a suspense, not a horror. Hide and Seek was a good suspense/horror, but still not a classic horror movie. Red Eye, straight up suspense, nothing else.</P>
<P>Honorable Mention:<STRONG>&nbsp; The Jacket</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Best Romantic Movie: Hitch</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Runner Up: Guess Who, Fever Pitch</STRONG></P>
<P>Hitch, besides the Notebook, is the ultimate romantic movie. If you just want to sit at home and watch a movie with your signifcant other, Hitch and Guess Who are the movies. Hitch is probably one of the best movies of the year. It came out in Feb. and shows that even fat men have a chance at the best looking girls ( beauty in the eye of the beholder in this movie) but still. It involves Alex Hitchins, a date doctor who sets up desperate men with attractive women . All he needs is 3 dates. And he does it. There are all sorts of great rules for dating in here, even if you didnt think about it before. It has great comedy and youll be quoting it for hours (i come 90 and u come 10).</P>
<P>Guess Who is a remake of Guess Whos Coming to DInner, with Sidney Portier. Its great with Bernie Mac, and will have&nbsp;you remembering good times (if your married) if youre not married, then its a good movie for when you first met your girlfriends dad (you have forced me to use the muscle). Classic.</P>
<P><STRONG>Best Documentary: March of the Penguins</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Runner Up: Born into Brothels, Super Size Me</STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;No im not doing this because my girlfriend is totally obsessed with Penguins. It is an honest, truly heartwarming story. Its acutally rated G, so its kid safe. Its not just a tale told by Morgan Freeman, its a tale of love and survival in the most unlikely place an organism can survive. Some of the scenes are tremedous, and babies are cute, and it is a feel good film.</P>
<P>Born into Brothels won the Academy Award last year for Best Documentary, in the absence of Michael Moore's stunning ""Farenheit 911."" This is good and bad. Its good because it allowed Born into Brothels to be recognized, but bad because a piece so truthful didnt get more recognition. Born into Brothels is about the poor children of India, and how a women takes photos and has them create pictures in order for them to get money for education. Its very sad, but heartwarming at the same time. I though that Super Size Me would have won, but born into brothels was a great movie in its own right</P>
<P><STRONG>Movies that looked Great that turned into utter, ridiculous crap and lowered you IQ while watching: Alexander, The Ring Two, Sin City, A Lot Like Love, Kingdom of Heaven, Submerged, Seven Seconds, White Noise, The Wedding Date, Be Cool, Racing Stripes, xXx: State of the Union, Alone in the Dark, Darkness, Cursed, Dark Water, Skeleton Key, Elektra, The Fantastic Four (I was soooo disappointed) </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Movies that are soo bad that they dont even get a category: The Dukes of Hazzard, SuperCross</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>David's Personal Favorites of the year: Winner: Robots</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Runner Ups: Constantine, National Treasure, Million Dollar Baby, The Interpreter, Kinsey, Kung-Fu Hustle, Fever Pitch, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;And in a surprise finish, Robots is perhaps the best movie of the year (so far) It has a great collection of voices, has great comedy and doesnt go too over the top, like the Wedding Crashers. It actually teaches something, which is something kids movies seriously lack. Everyone needs to see Robots.....seriously. You wont regret it.</P>
<P>Some of these other ones are biases. Constantine, National Treasure, and Fever Pitch are biases bc they are all great movies about my intrests. Just because im into history doesnt mean i like all history movies ( See Kingdom of Heaven). must sees are the interpreter, and Charlie. These two esp. are fantastic.</P>
<P><STRONG>Movies to Wait for: The Exorcism of Emily Rose, King Kong, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Spiderman and XMen III</STRONG></P>

Ur girlfriend whom u love isnt in the immediate area, my best friend is leaving for the navy in a week, dad gave me a car that overheats every 2 seconds, I sorely miss all my temple peeps, i have to start over @ a completely new school with new friends, I have to stay at home instead of a dorm. Too many changes....and i have a hard time dealing with change as it is.

This time last year, my parents were together, i got along with my sister a little bit (cough cough) I left for temple, my best friend was still around, I had the Protege (i still miss my little white car) 

That said, I am ON THE REBOUND. I took myself off accutane (which side effects include severe depression...goo figure) Im reved up for the new school year, ready to meet some new ppl. Im gonna go see Chrissy this sat, when i pick her up so she can have dinner with me my dad and my dads girlfriend, I have a new car one thats in MY Name and MY insurance.$81 a month thru Geico, not bad. The car failed inspection bc of a huge ass gash in the windshield, but i have 15 days to fix it and thats in my range for a pay check. ANd with any luck, ill be out of the area by January, to leave Virginia Beach and all the problems it has caused in the dust...."

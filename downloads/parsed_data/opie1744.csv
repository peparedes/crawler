"event","Fuck South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin! A vote was passed in all those states to ban gay marriage. Someone PLEASE explain to me what this is all about. Holy shittypants, you've got to be fucking kidding me. It passed 81% in Tennessee. That's like saying after a Volunteer football game 81,000 fans went to Ellen Degeneres' home and all, one by one, spat in her face and screamed, ""We dont like you, faggot!!!"" Well, something like that....

It is BLATANT discrimination to say marriage exists strictly between a MAN and a WOMAN. This should not even be an issue. It is absolutely absurd. It is so so so hard for me to understand. I dont get it. Who the fuck are these people!?!??!!!!!! WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU TO SAY WHO CAN AND CANNOT GET MARRIED!?!?

I know nothing about economics and finances, but I would assume once people have a marriage license, they have more financial rights and benefits than a couple without a marriage license. Also, on that whole idea of ""love,"" I would assume there are many gay couples that would love to have some ceremony celebrating their soul mateishness for eternity!! Eh?

But yea, fuck the idea that such an amendment could even go through and double fuck the idea that people (fuck the people who voted for it, too of course, for their discrimination) can decide the rights for other people they probably dont even know. And triple fuck Donald Rumsfeld. May he be sitting in the same seat Saddam Hussein sat in and may he be found just as guilty for his crimes against humanity.

Now go in peace, to love and serve the Lord."

Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi's have died since the first invasion, followed by the economic sanctions (those that forced the civilans to rely on Saddam for their own survival) and then the second war. And in case you didn't know, Israel is probably the world's second worst terrorist state, what with their 35 years of illegal occupation of Palestine. It is more than justified for whoever to start fighting back (still rooting for that ole fashioned non-violence to come about sometime) against Israel because those in power in Israel are thirsting to end Palestine completely. And also, in case you didn't know, Israel gets just about all their weapons from america, the world's leading state in terror. The american government totally supports and could CARE LESS what Israel does to the mideast. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aipac 
America is the empire. The Project for a New American Century people are the terrorists. American people are still sleeping. American people are still a bunch of sheep. The media keeps on lying. They're making their lies sound truthful...my, my the power of linguistics and the lexicon. This planet is so fucked. World War 3 is a comin...Hope you are all prepared. Sounds like Hezbollah and al-Queda are gonna team up. That should make for a good show. I really hope global warming and nuclear weapons fear increases onemillion-fold within the next couple years. Everyone's all afraid of dying and shit...We're all gonna die, people. Let's put some mmph into it. Maybe I should stop all this silly dissidence and start being in favor of the destruction of the planet of the speeding up of the extinction of the human race. What can I say?

My knee is totally fucked and I'm having orthroscopic surgery on it in a month so they can remove another piece of bone that is chipped loose (from car wreckies) and graft the fuck out of some cartilage.

I have about a year and a half left of school and I will definitely be graduating in Political Science. I am going to have to completely understand politics if I plan on destroying it. What am I going to do with it? No idea. Probably completely sell out to the man and adapt to mundanity and have a normal job. But once I get that degree, it's travel-around-the-world-before-we're-all-extinct time. I'm moving into a nice house off Nicholson come August with guys I dont know and am more than happy to be getting outta my parents house...nothing against them, but driving across town sucks balls.

"event","So President Bush criticized Democrats for talking ""politics"" as they criticize his handling of the war. Here's what he said. ""They spoke the truth then (then being when they got behind him for the war) and they're speaking politics now.""
Yes, the Democrats are WEAK, WEAK, WEAK. And please, PLEASE dont even identify me with being a democrat. They saddled up with Bush and were afraid to go against ameriKa in anyway at all. However, the thing is, he did say Iraq had weapons of mass destruction which means he did NOT tell the truth, seeing that Iraq never actually did have any weapons of mass destruction. Democrats ignorantly believed him, but they did so because they thought what they were being told was true. When you say scary things like ""weapons of mass destruction"" and ""mushroom cloud"" they have an effect on people's way of thinking. 
And now Bush says the democrats were speaking the ""truth"" whenever he never was from the beginning. Come again, please.
A particular truism is there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq whenever Bush said there would be. Another truism is ameriKa actually used weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (depleted uranium, being nuclear).
I'm curious how much of the war is really in people's consciousness, nowadays or if it's just seen as ""Welp, we're in war. Politicians lie and lots people die. Ah, well..."""

I may get a D in Geog. if I study really hard, but hey, who really wants to put forth THAT much effort in a class I didn't want to take but basically had to seeing that it was one of the only few left to choose from. My classes next semester are Asian Religions, Communication Disorders, Linguistics, English 2123 (films and stuff like that!) and Comparitive Politics.
I love my room. I have two big windows, a big couch and this computer and books and my big bed with a nice down comforter and a guitar and music and fresh aroma's and incense and a mirror and me. Meanwhile, Danny sleeps on the couch and Randy is never here because hes all serious with his little girlfriend...whatever that is...
Saturday was dreadful. I was told we were having people over to watch the game and Adam Miller shows up first, and then bam! Sammy D'Agostino with two of the most racist, obnoxious, wicked-minded, drunken fucks I've ever met. I had a migraine and almost threw up things got so horrific. I like quiet nights such as this one and the silence I have during the days.
However, come March, it's back home for Mattie. I've lived in four different places in two and half years and have gotten much insanity out of my system. I figure it's now time to join back with the insanity that I origninally left.

"event","OK, honestly, this really did happen today. I swear this one is not made up. The other story, yes, bullshit. This one, no...really happened.

I had an appointment today at 11:30 to see my doctor about how my adderall-taking was going. I dont take it anymore, but people are willing to buy some so if people wanna buy pills, sure, no big deal, help yourselves. I just needed to get some more. So I walk in at 11:40, obviously ten minutes late, thinking, ""OK, well I'm ten minutes late..."" I go to the front desk and tell the lady there that I have an appointment with Dr. Forgey. She says OK and asks me to fill out some shit and go wait in the waiting room. I take the info to fill out, go to the waiting room, and start filling out the information. Then I hear, ""Mr. Walsh, come back to the front please."" Immediately I knew this wasn't going to be any good news. I just knew she wasn't going to go ""Here ya go,"" with her hand out. ""Just wanted to make sure you got a Blow Pop.""
She said it flat out. ""I'm sorry, but Dr. Forgey cancelled you as a patient and said you're going to have to find another physician because of your missed appointments.""
I missed my last appointment, but you see, I didn't miss this appointment.
I was sure to let her know that.
""I'm sorry"" she said, ""But if you miss two straight appointments we have to cancel you.""
""No, I didn't miss this appointment. I was ten minutes late...I'm here, right now...""
Apparently there was nothing she could do. I wasn't mad at her. She was just relaying the message that the doctor was a shitdick. She seemed to understand the absolute absurdity of the situation. I left expressing how I believed this to be ""a little extreme and a little crazy...""
As I reached my car I decided I would take my frustration out on the doctor personally. So I turned around and went back inside. The receptionist made the ""uh-oh"" face.
With a polite smirk I said, ""I'm gonna have to talk to the doctor.""
""I'm sorry, but he probably wont talk to you.""
""Is he here right now?""
""Yes...""
""Well you're going to have to tell him I wanna talk to him.""
""OK, I'll tell him, but he probably wont talk to you.""
Luckily, he just happened to walk out at that time for something. Probably babyfood.
She closed the little sliding-glass door and talked to him whisperingly.
She opened the sliding glass door back up and Dr. Fattyfuck blabbers, ""Well, I'm sorry, but you missed your last 2 appointments.""
Again, I was sure to tell him I didn't miss this appointment because I was standing right in front of him. Obviously late, but still in the same area as he.
""Well, this is a level 3 narcotic drug. I cant just go out passing slips around like it's nothing.""
Actually he can because that's what he had been doing the past few times I picked up the slips. And I'm sure it would have still been a level 3 narcotic had I arrived on time...
Anywho, I closed with the following scream: ""I'm only human people! Humans show up late for appointments!"" Then said in a sharp, yet easy tone, ""Fucking robots..."" and left.
I'm so happy with myself that I called him a robot. It really made me feel human..."

"event","Well, I've put much into perspective.
I am certainly now 21 years old and I am certainly now a student at LSU taking classes.
I am totally lost and have not a clue what I want to do with my life.
I need to meet new people who agree with me about music, politics, life in general, etc., so I can partake in conversation with them instead of reading books and staying trapped inside my head.
I went through my ""am I freakin gay!?"" stage this past summer and understood that I'm not (though I probably would not mind being intimate in some way with the lead singer of Placebo because there is something about him I find very, very sexy...seriously). I dont mind admitting if a guy is sexy or not. I know what sexy is and am not afraid to acknowledge it. I'm also not really afraid to express my feminine side cuz boy, oh boy, have I got one. I've never really had much appreciation for the rules of what I have seen of what it takes to be a man. In fact I've seen many of them to be quite childish. I mean, I know as far as gender goes, I'm a male cuz I've got this thing sticking out of my body below my navel, but I will do and say what I want to do and say, whether or not it may appear a little questionable. Maybe one day I will start dressing androgynous just to freak people out. Ya know, who really gives a shit?
I must say yoga is probably to blame for the reasons of me opening up a bit more. As abstract as this may sound, the stretching and opening up of your body does open up the way you express yourself and opens up the way you perceive things. I would say it opens up your spirit, but as far as talking about the soul goes, that's where things get a little questionable. I still say our spirit is our consciousness and our ability to choose the right things in life. The entire human body really is amazing, what with the things you can do with it and the pleasures you can find in it.
That being said, I think I'd like to party sometime soon and I think I'd like to either throw one or go out and have some drinks. I know, I know I've been saying how I'm done drinking, but you should have known that was just a phase. I am still Irish. I had to also punish myself for the stupid things I did. But no more drinking and driving...
I've put things into perspective, I know where I stand. 
And fuck that whole ""going out"" bullshit. Where can we all go where we can just sit and talk and where I can hear people fully instead of putting my left ear directly into your face and have you scream? Ya know...
Any suggestions? Any one?"

"event","I needed to figure out some things about scheduling classes so I went to see a counselor today. Here's what happened. It's all true.

I went to Allen, signed in and sat down in the waiting area.
I pulled out a book and started reading it. Every now and then I'd look up and notice this one girl staring at me then she would look down real quickly. I thought it was very strange the way the advisors called people in to see them. The rooms were labeled by the letters of the alphabet. Instead of an advisor walking out and saying who was next, it must be a lot easier to sit at your desk and scream the name with the letter. But the way they did it really had me think whether it was appropriate or not.
For example, after about a minute of sitting down, I hear, ""James McMantz, Office O! O as in Oh No, Here we go again."" I looked up confused, saw the girl staring at me, and looked around to see if anyone else found that be a bit strange. No one seemed bothered.
I went back to reading my book and then heard, ""Lindsey Strasner, Office J. J as in Julie Julie Julie Julie cant find her booksack...""
Now this really had me lost. It didn't make any sense to me why the advisors were using complete sentences to make sure the students understood what letter was being called.
About a minute later I hear in a loud, confident voice, ""Pam Roberts! Office L. L as in Gerbil."" This was immediately followed by, ""Matt Walsh! Office N as in Nancy Boy!"" Getting up, seeing that girl looking at me still, I felt the urge to quickly walk away. I decided, however, to go ahead and go with it because I really needed to figure some things out.
I walked in and was greeted by a woman who seemed to be about 50, very frail and fake.
""Hello Nancy b...I'm sorry. Mr. Walsh. How can I help you?""
We both stared at each coldly for about ten seconds.
""OK, I'm majoring in Political Science and I've yet to take any foreign language courses...""
I was cutoff in mid-sentence.
""Well you need foreign language courses,"" she said.
""Yes, I know. That's why I'm here. It said in the handbook that students taking 1101 wont receive credit.""
""Oh, no, you'll receive credit.""
""Well why does it say 'students taking this course will not receive credit.'""
""That doesn't make any sense.""
""What doesn't make any sense?""
She stared at her computer for about five seconds. ""What is your social security number?"" she asked.
I told it to her and she pulled up my transcripts. ""Oh. You went to BRCC. Well I dont know about all of that then.""
""All of what?"" I asked, getting a little annoyed.
""Look, political science requires foreign language courses. You haven't taken any foreign language courses yet.""
""Yes ma'am. I know. That's what I'm trying to do. If I take 1101 will I get the hours for taking it?""
""If you take the hours, you'll get the credit. This is college.""
She then spun her chair around 360 degrees, stopped herself in front of her desk, staring at the papers in front of her, looking confused. I, too, was confused.
In the background I heard, ""Larry Johnson! Office T as in Take it to the Limit by the Eagles.""
We both looked at each other and then she spun around 360 degrees the opposite way and caught herself.
""Not bad,"" she said with a smirk. ""Not bad at all...""
I got up and left."

Spending time in Argentina helping the world, President Bush received a memo from the White House about an ethics meeting.
""It's an ethics meeting. We'll discuss cultures and groups, I'm sure,"" Bush said in response to what the meeting would be about.
When corrected that it was an ethics meeting, not ethnics, Bush replied, ""Right. Culture-talk.""
After being told the difference between ethics, being about principles and ethnics, being about culture, Bush seemed confused.
""I am the President of the United States of America. Not the principle. I'm sure you could shorten that and call me the Prince. But it seems to me that I'm more like the king,"" he said with a chuckle.
He was then told that the principles being talked about in this case are the ones referring to proper behavior having something to do with truth, not the principals of schools.
""Look, OK. Truth-talk, whatever. So we wont talk about cultures. We seem to understand that part rather well, anyway. As far as talking about principles and proper behavior, that's fine too. After all, I am the president of the United States, so I'm sure the American people will be wanting to learn about this 'ethics.'
The president was then corrected again, being told that he was going to be involved in a meeting about ""the rules governing the protection of classified information,"" and will not be teaching anyone about ethics.
""Yea, OK. Classified information. Information for me and my cabinet only, right?. Not information for you. We've got to keep that hidden. Cant let anyone else know anything, ya know. I think I understand what ethics means now...""
After receiving harsh criticism from Venezualan President Chavez, Bush was asked how he would deal with such words.
""Well, I'm going to be nice. I'm going to treat him as the American people would like me to treat him. I'm going to go over to him, shake his hand and say, 'Thank you.' Then, I'm sure I'll heed the words of my fellow Christian friend, Pat Robertson and probably have him shot sometime...""
He ended his questions with a five minute talk on freedom and liberty and how it is the right of every individual in this world.

It's unbelievable the effects excessive drug-use can have on a person.
My first month at LSU was spent in a hazy state, shocked with just how different and how serious it is.  The students in my English discussion class seem to really, really know what's going on and I cant help but feel like a little child in the mall who has lost his mommy...
I went through a period of withdrawal for about a week and I really, really, rrrrreally wanted to mix me and jack and coke, smoke a joint, and have a cigarette. I'd become extremely depressed and a few times got really, really pissed off and wanted to knock the hell out of Randy for being such a...(gotta stop the judging, too)  But, like George Costanza's father with ""Serenity now,"" the medicine is meditation.  It really is healthy to let those feelings and thoughts of madness and sadness to come in and totally take over and see exactly why they are there, feeling them fade away with proper breathing and thinking. Meditation is extremely hard at the beginning. The idea is focusing on one particular thing at first or nothing at all. Also, you are to watch your thoughts as they creep in your head and brush them off.
The lunatics are in my head.
It feels good, too, because this way of life is what is going to bring down the American empire. The state of the world is determined by our state of mind. Finding a certain type of peace and joy and laughing can only HELP."

So he's talking and teaching and he says, ""OK, so we can have a 9-bar...or, we can have a Zero-bar. Then there was a little pause as he kept writing.  Within that pause I begin giggling to myself because I was hoping so so so bad he would, for some strange reason just say, ""Or, if that's not gonna work, you could maybe have a Klondike bar..."" and I imagined him make a sketch of a klondike bar with the big bear and then take one out of his pocket and toss it to a student, who would then have an incredibly lost look on their face...
I laughed for the last 10 minutes of that class then continued laughing for oh, I dunno, about the next 2 hours throughout my other classes and while walking around the campus just thinking if that would have really happened. It didn't of course, but it would have been quite a spectacle...

We discussed how we are not seperate from God and how God is within every single one of us. We discussed how we all are Gods in a sense. We discussed how we are all one, living underneath the same sun and how we are made out of sunlight. We discussed how we have always been here and how we will always be here. We talked about the different dimensions we live in and how dying never felt so good. And we talked about politics and how Americans got to be so incredibly ignorant, and obviously remain so."

Me say war That until the basic human rights are equally
Guaranteed to all, without regard to race
Dis a war
--BOB MARLEY

The more I think of everything that has happened over the past four years alone the less I'm able to really be able to genuinely smile.
I've come to the conclusion that I just cant drink like I used to. I told a buddy of mine that ""after blacking out once, I figure that should be it."" He then said, ""Yeah right...there'll be another."" Thanks for the support friend.
Fucking stupid I am. How evil alcohol really is. It's insane that people have to rely on alcohol to get a connection, to be able to do something they normally wouldn't do while being sober. It's a matter of conditioning/programming yourself and it's proof of personal weakness and fear which I dont really care too much for anymore. I know I have all the tools necessary inside of me. I know I can do anything I wanna do now and til forever. And most importantly, after reading more and more on psychospiritual integration, I have realized an important thing about that so called ""God.""
In my opinion, it has been a mistake to believe that God is seperate from us. I think doing that has caused much pain and fear and MUCH seperation. I think God is not seperate from us but actually inside of us all. I think ""God,"" however you want to define that word, is a part of you and I and everyone and everything else. Again, he is not seperate, but a part of us.
I also know that George Harrison was WAAAAAY ahead of his time and with that I leave you with the lyrics of WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU.

We were talking-about the space between us all
And the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth-then it's far too late-when they pass away.
We were talking-about the love we all could share-when we find it
To try our best to hold it there-with our love
With our love-we could save the world-if they only knew.
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No-one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small,
And life flows ON within you and without you.
We were talking-about the love that's gone so cold and the people,
Who gain the world and lose their soul-
They don't know-they can't see-are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself-then you may find, peace of mind,
Is waiting there-
And the time will come when you see
we're all one, and life flows on within you and without you."

"event","Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I'm 21. Big freakin deal. So if I want to go buy beer, I can. Great, marvelous, super!
As I told Miss Jessie M., growing older is inevitable, but growing UP is optional. To explain myself more, I do not mean I'm gonna keep drinking like a fish and being irresponsible with my mind and body. I mean I'm gonna try and keep these feelings that have returned to me that have been hiding for so many years. I mean I'm still a kid at heart and dont care for that manly-man-buy-a-12-pack-smoke-some-cigarettes-and-go-to-the-casino kind of stuff.
I've been doing a lot of breathing techniques/meditation and have been figuring myself out more and more each day through chakra balancing and psychospriritual transformation through the help of pictures (lauren coye actually made me a collage for my bday, which is a big help seeing how i dont really have many pictures of myself) which is quite freeing indeed.
I'm pretty mad at myself for actually having my first blackout ever on Friday night, but can forgive myself seeing that I did turn 21, which really is an important age. It is an age to make particular choices for the better. I'm glad I did black out for it taught me a valuable lesson: Don't drink to the point where I will black out anymore.
So I blacked out and dont remember leaving the bar, dont remember being driven home and dont remember being walked up the flight of stairs at northgate. I certainly dont remember throwing up and sure as hell dont remember Joanna grabbing me by the hair and screaming ""Give him water! He has to drink the water!"" (oh, god bless her).
I felt like shit all day Saturday and didn't have much energy within me at the keg party that night. Alcohol abuse really is stupid. It really, really is. I told my friend Brittany Wax that I wanted to learn how to swing dance so if she keeps her word on that, well then, that should be all I really need, cuz once you know how to swing dance, I couldn't imagine life to offer much more. I'd like to continue to go out, but ya see, when I go out, I have this hearing problem (that is getting worse due to the volume of the music I play) and well, I just cant hear you. I seriously have to put my left ear right up to your mouth and hope you scream loud enough. And when I go out and if everyone is drinking, then I'm probably gonna wanna drink too.
Ummm, OKAY, Alex Trebek on Celebrity Poker just got me lost for a little while.
Where did I wanna go with this.
Oh! Umm, yeah. Drinking = bad. Swing dancing = good.
Maybe that drinking is now legal, it just wont be as fun anymore...
Life can really be beautiful. I dont even think I've mentioned this story before...
As you may or may not know, I've been trying to learn more and more about Buddhism and Taoism and Chakra balancing and other subjects filled with wisdom and mind-body freedom. It has gradually built up over time. Anywho, at Metro Mail Express, my old place of work, a funny thing happened. A lady named Elizabeth Owen, who is good friends with my boss, came in and said she was moving to Maine. She has travelled all around the world and is a deeply spiritual person. She said she had so much stuff that she didn't care to bring with her and asked us to ebay for her and just send her the check when we're all done. And amazingly enough, 95% of the stuff she brings to us are buddhist teachings, buddhist statues, chakra balancing, and so on and so forth...
I was completely overwhelmed and extremely excited to have all this new information placed right in front of me just as I'm starting to take an interest into it. She said there was no hurry and I could take as much time as I wanted with them, then ebay it. That's the way it works I suppose. She seemed to be educated on much and passed it on to the next person which happened to find me at a rather good timing. Coincidence? I think NOT!
SO! If you are interested in just hanging out, talking about life, enlightening ourselves more through experience by throwing ourselves out into the world with those wild ""others"" (who are just like us all) or by any way you feel appropriate, let me know. Cuz I'm all ear. You get that! All ear!? Woo!
OKAY, back to Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream. How appropriate..."

Well, well, well. Twenty one years of Irish life in America has been much fun indeed. As I enter into the state of 'adulthood' I must say I feel pretty good. Kind of like a child actually...
It's funny, I have this little Virgo book and in it it says that September 17 of this year will be a very special day, full of high energy. But the thing about this day is that it's not special just for us Virgo's, but that it's the best day of the year for ALL signs, who will be celebrating with me, duh! I guess you could call that coincidental, but I'm gonna say just for fun that it means much, much more. Also, the full Harvest Moon is out waiting on us all to party underneath it so yeah, the timing for all this just happens to be perfect. The energies and emotions will be running high all weekend and since I know everyone wants to join in, well here are the plans.
FRIDAY, Sept 16, we will be heading to Chelsea's to see Elsah, one of the best bands in Baton Rouge play.
SATURDAY, Sept 17, there will be a keg party at Jonathon Dyers house (call me for directions)
So all I ask is that you be prepared because we are all going to be out of our freakin minds.

(taken from a website)September 17, at 10:01 p.m. EDT -- The Full Harvest Moon. Traditionally, this designation goes to the Full Moon that occurs closest to the Autumnal (Fall) Equinox. In two years out of three, the Harvest Moon comes in September, but every third year it occurs in October. At the peak of the harvest, farmers can work into the night by the light of this moon. Usually the full Moon rises an average of 50 minutes later each night, but for the few nights around the Harvest Moon, the Moon seems to rise at nearly the same time each night: just 25 to 30 minutes later across the U.S., and only 10 to 20 minutes later for much of Canada and Europe. Corn, pumpkins, squash, beans, and wild rice -- the chief Indian staples -- are now ready for gathering.
Ahh..."

All you ignorant, IGNORANT fucks keeps screaming about all these fucking ""niggers!"" You know what ""niggers"" are???? They are human beings! You know what you people are who call them ""niggers!?"" Welp, just so happens you are a human being also. So when you call someone a ""nigger,"" you are actually calling yourself a ""nigger."" YOU see a ""nigger"" as being some kind of a monster, totally devoid of human understanding.
But that's just the thing. These folks (what you call niggers) totally get what's going on right now. Maybe they didn't receive the education you and I received from a private school with uniforms. But they do understand the only reason they are here in America is because they were taken from their original home in Africa and brought here to build America through the form of SLAVERY. Some ""white"" folks say,  ""Yeah, well, slavery was over 200 years ago!"" But that does not deny the fact that IT STILL HAPPENED. Obviously, being ""white"" and fucking ""anglo-american"" you cant understand what happened through slavery. And dont think I'm here speaking for the black population...I'm speaking for the HUMAN-BEING population. If we can empathize with how horrible the Holocaust was for the Jews, then why cant we empathize with how fucking horrible slavery was when it came time to build fucking ameriKa?!?!?!?!?!?! Mother-daughter, Father-son, Husband-wife, Boyfriend-girlfriend, Brother-sister, LOVER-LOVER!!!!!!! did not mean a thing at all. All that mattered was whether you were able to tend the fucking fields and take care of our fucking plantations. And remember, THIS IS WAY AFTER WE TOTALLY ANNIHILATED THE INDIAN RACE...(catching on to the REAL history here...not the ""praise christopher columbus history""?)
Anywho, you say these are ""niggers"" looting and shooting at innocent people. Maybe they are looting and shooting at innocents. But think of where they come from and think of how they've grown up. These ""criminals"" by passion ARE pure human beings. They are doing what a human being should do. They are being HONEST with themselves. Having no place to live anymore and no money to survive, they are fighting for justice for themselves.
And where exactly has the help been? Why did it take a week to fucking get help!?!?
How about this...In 2001, the FEMA was cut off 44 percent of their salary. Why were they cut off 44 percent!? So we had extra money to go and attack IRAQ!!!!
And if you have had your head outside of your asshole for the past 4 years, it should be obvious to see that the war in IRAQ has been for OIL!!!!!!!!!!!!
And if you can catch on here a little bit more, then you should be able to see that the Republicans in charge of Planet Earth right now are more interested in Profit, rather than human beings. And ya know what I think? This may sound crazy, but EYE think People should come before profit. When bombs are dropped on innocent human beings, we are really dropping bombs on our own fucking souls. We say we are at war with the terrorists. But no, no, no! We are at war with ourselves so we find reasons for it to be okay to drop bombs on people in a distant land. 
I think people should live here on planet Earth in a state of fucking tranquility and peace. I think people should live here on Planet Earth without being afraid of bombs being dropped on them, without being afraid of having their family, friends, or LOVERS taken away from them just so some people can be a little richer. I fucking think that these ""niggers"" know exactly what's going on and I think that they need some fucking help because the homes that they knew of no longer exist anymore because Hurricane Katrina blew them away. Oh yeah and also, Hurricane Katrina was not a deadly hurricane...Global warming turned it into a deadly hurricane. Global warming, which is more of a human fault than nature running its course. If you haven't been feeling the extreme heat in this city and are unaware of how much coal was burned in new orleans for the great oil and gas enterprises, well then you need to shut the fuck up about how much you hate these ""niggers!"" Because when you speak, it's nothing but pure ignorance coming from your ignorant mind. We are all in this together. We are all human beings. Just because evolution made our skin a little different and greed made us become a little monstrous gives you no right at all to call those who are truly innocent the monsters. ameriKa is the monster. ameriKa is the uncivilzed part of planet Earth. Republicans have done nothing but tell lies since 2000.
Anywho, we are now at a period in human history where it's either peace or annihilation. You can either show empathy, compassion, and love to those who have been less fortunate and more underpriveleged than you and I or you can continue being a monster by calling your own brothers and sisters monsters, or as you like to call them, ""niggers.""
But remember, the only real nigger is those who call someone else a nigger. A nigger, whether you want to believe it or not, IS A HUMAN BEING, JUST LIKE YOU!!!!! Your heart is obviously made of stone and totally unable to understand true human love and understanding...
So once again, mr. or ms. conservative...please shut the fuck up, leave town, or change your ignorant way of thinking and help out, because my open-mind and more importantly, my open-HEART, does not need you, nor do I want you destroying my family tree with your fucking useless hate..."

www.meetwithcindy.org

Her son was killed in Iraq and well, she's doing something about it. She's well aware that Bush and Co. have done nothing but lie, lie, lie their little pants off. She is standing outside his Texas ranch while the fuck is on a 5 week vacation. She is standing right outside until he comes out to meet with her so she can ask him, ""What did my son die for?"" And she doesn't want to hear anything about democracy and freedom. She wants the truth. She wants to hear him say, ""Well! We had to steal their oil and make some companies and friends a little richer! We didn't know anything about WMD's!!""
And if he doesn't come out to talk to her, she's following him to Washington DC.
Ladies and gentlemen, Bush is on his way down, down, down.
All it takes is a little spark like Cindy Sheehan (a fellow redhead) to start a monstrous fire. I hope all you conservative cuties who were all in support for this war are about ready for a change of thinking because you are about to be in the minority if you stay behind Bush. Actually, you always have been in the minority. The entire world was against this war. America was hit with strong, bullshit propaganda that scared everyone to death that Saddam was going to kill us all. And with that, the bombs dropped and many of our brothers and sisters have been killed. Our own brothers and sisters! I've always felt like I was in the minority as I sat here in this little ignorant spot of the world. But I'm totally aware that I'm with the majority of every other country in the entire world. And ohhh baby, when I start LSU, I'm gonna spread around words just like this. And I'm totally aware that LSU is full of little conservative offspring who just LOVE their little president. And I'm gonna let everyone know just how wrong they were. I'll be sure to be rational and tame about it and I'll be sure to not cut anyone down in anyway at all because that's not my style. But if anyone wants to say shit to me, which I'm expecting, well...they will lose. My heart is way too strong right now.

"event","So today is the five year anniversary of the day Trent and I escaped that thing called ""death"" from that car wreck thing I got into.
The car wreck was at the Goodyear on Coursey right before you reach Jones Creek.
And well, I suppose it was a ""good year,"" eh.
If I would have worn a seatbelt, I would have been totally crushed and um, not writing this right now.
However, the powers that be made sure I made the decision not to wear one. I was ejected and was knocked unconscious for about 15 minutes. I then remember seeing nothing but blood. Blood was all over my face, still running from the back of my head, all over my hands and shirt and running its way down the concrete. At that time, I was absolutely positive I was dying. Trust me on this one: It does not at all feel good to think that you are taking your last breaths. It is not a very comfortable feeling to be in a state of mind where you are sure this is the end of you.
However, I'm extremely greatful that that did happen.  Coming so close to death and being in a state of mind where you are sure it's coming can kind of change your perception on life a little bit.
Life, right here, right now is all we've got. I'm not too interested in any afterlife, because it's well, AFTER life. And that may mean, no life afterlife. Ya see, I'm more interested in during life, such as right here, right now.
So now you can even better understand why I'm so against totally pointless wars and absurd religions screaming about being a good boy or girl for something as made up as an afterlife.
Death is real. It is very, very real. But it is a beautiful gift. Death is what makes life possible. The fact that death waits for us is what makes us search for that perfect love people only think is possible in a dream. And because death waits, we're given the opportunity to make decisions that could put us in a state of mind in which we start to question whether or not this is heaven.
The day before my sister's wedding, I was rear-ended really, really hard. I was hit so hard it made me ram into the car in front of me. I'm guessing because I've been doing yoga for the past half year or so, I didn't have any type of injury at all. I had a horrible whiplash, but it didn't phase me a bit. It was strange because nothing happened to the front of my car and not a thing happened to the back of the car I was pushed into.
I was really confused for the next couple of days because there was so much going on. My sister was getting married, my family was in town, my cousin Ryan was talking about moving back here, and so on and so forth. And after this wreck I'm looking at our cars and am totally shocked that nothing happened to anybody and nothing happened to our cars. I began to question the laws of physics and whether or not any of this was really happening.
Then all sorts of these really awkward coincidences started happening. I tried not to drink too much at the reception because of the strange coincidences and was worried that maybe because I was rammed so hard the day before I may have been internally bleeding or something terrible (though I know for sure I was thinking on a different level than normal). But after a while I did get a little drunk and then started thinking really crazy. Listen to this...I thought Tiger Stadium really was going to become a death valley. But I did figure out that cigarettes are mini nuclear weapons that do to the cells in our body the same thing those bombs did to the people living in Japan in 1945. I then started thinking that death is bullshit. Like Stewie Griffin said when he was high, ""We only die because we because we accept it as inevitable!"" I started thinking about the sun and the moon and how they still shine on and John Lennon's lyrics, ""like the moon and the stars and sun, we all shine on..."" But then I remembered the sun and moon are actually dead! I then realized that our body's are nothing but constant energy and are mini-universes and if treated properly, we can live in a state of peace for a very, very long time.
I know now that all is well.
Ever since the wedding, I've been in an incredible state of awareness. I've noticed that staying in this state, you experience more and more coincidences everyday. And when you pay attention to these coincidences and understand what they mean, you start to realize you are in a field of infinite possibilites.
HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS IS PURE POTENTIALITY.
So yeah, my life has been entertaining. It's good to be, ya know, ALIVE.
As I drive around during the day, I'm totally aware that it's been raining while the sun is out(be sure you go out and look at the sky after it happens again). And I'm totally aware that heaven is right above us. The clouds seem to go on forever. Some appear to come up from the ground hundreds of miles away and look like these fascinating, magical white mountains. I'll go outside and stare at the moon at night in wonder.
I'll then go off thinking about what was way before Baton Rouge was called Baton Rouge. This city is so insanely full of life. The Mississippi River is the river of life. The food here is so amazing, the females here are absolute goddesses. Notice how it's been so, so hot, but we've been receiving a good bit of rain here and there. The indians had it right. Living near the river, living with nature. America is not advanced. All we've done is destroy so much LIFE. But I am glad I wound up on a spot of the world that is so full of life. I'm quite glad I know all the people that I do and I'm quite glad I'm soon to be 21 so we can all go out and get drunk and worship life every chance we possible get...
And finally, let me repeat: anything is possible with your life. All we know of is the here and now. Wherever you are right now in life is where you have decided to be from the trillions of decisions you have made up to this point. And you are blessed with many, many more decisions to be made throughout your life. And if you want to, you can decide to be in a state of mind in which you are assured that this is heaven...
And no, I'm not under the influence of any drugs.
And yes, I'm totally aware of the third world war, the war against the third world countries is still going on right now.
But I'm totally aware that karma works.
LIFE, MY FRIENDS, IS NOTHING BUT A STATE OF MIND.
Namaste..."

It's stupid to feel all sorry when ""terrorists"" kill white folks who look like us great Americans, but who really cares about the brown folk, eh.  This was nothing new that happened today, it just so happened to take place in a more ""civilized"" part of the world.
And also, ""terrorists,"" whether you like it or not, are still human beings..."

The House OK'd a flag buring ban today and for the first time ever there is a chance it could become an amendment if it passes through the Seante.
So this is where we stand...
A country that has been having it's way with Planet Earth for the past 60 years is now deciding it's illegal to burn it's flag. Now I dunno if too many people understand this yet, but the flag is a symbol. No, no, no, the flag is a piece of cloth with different colors and shapes. Those different colors and shapes create a symbol, but in all actuality, it symbolizes many different things, instead of just one thing, like other symbols. We all know what the Nike check stands for and what the Peace sign stands for and what our sun signs stand for, but that American flag stands for a couple different things.
If you are a total moron and completely out of your mind, you may think it stands for freedom, liberty, and justice. But the truth of the matter is that the American flag today seems to stand for hypocrisy, hegemony, and total annihilation of Planet Earth and brown-colored human beings.
I'm pretty sure Hitler made sure it was illegal to do anything to the swastika. And now, Republican-powered Amerika is looking to do the same with its stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid fucking flag. I really hope it passes and I really hope people go to DC and burn as many fucking stupid Amerikan flags as possible.
Fuck me I hate the ignorant Republican ideology.
Dont hate the people! Hate the fucking ridiculous, ignorant way they think and their refusal to change that! And remember it's always only a handful of people that make things miserable for everyone. It's only a handful of these old, old stupid politicians that still have the heydey of post WW2 in their minds and seem to think that this is the same America as it was in 1946.
Oh, I'm going to blow my brains out one day..."

In fact, whoever is in charge of this incredible design must have had a fun time drawing it all up. But, I'm figuring em out now.
In my own little crazy, fun world.
Gosh, you people have just no idea how much fun it is to be me. No idea at all.
WAL MART. Okay, they were close.
Take out the R out of MART and put it in the middle of those two words.
Now make those two words switch spots and you're stuck with what? MAT R WAL...The first 3 letters of my first name, my middle initial, and the first 3 letters of my last name. So close!
Does anybody have any idea of the significance with the number 23? Well look it up, it's a very important number.
Anywho, let's go over that number and me.
Walsh...W...23rd letter of the alphabet.
My phone number, 3+1+7+0+2+7+3=23
My home address, 7+5+5+6=23
My zip code, 7+0+8+1+7=23
My PIN Number, 8+6+1+8=23
The bar code on my cute little <a href='http://consumeralertsystem.com/cas/zx-hclick.php?hid=42' target='_blank'>virgo</a> book, 5+0+4+9+5=23
The PEACE sign, most important sign for us, right? 2 fingers up, 3 fingers down. Hold up two peace signs, to V's, put em together, you have a W.
Oh, I could go on all day with other happenings, but I don't wanna bore you!
I'll go ahead and say this is all coinicidental, but man, I dunno...
Stuff this silly could only happen to me, I suppose.
It's a good time to be alive.
Probably the best.
Life is a dream.
As for the whole Iraq war thing, dont worry about that, folks. Truth, which I used to consider only a 5 letter word, is on its way out right now. Truth, the enemy of the state, is rearing its beautiful head. Truth will have some actual legitimate substance behind it. Pay attention closely because I know that's something you have all been trying to ignore. Listen to words like ""Downing Street memo"" or ""memogate,"" and ""depleted uranium"" (that one will be tough to swallow). TRUTH will take care of all that.
And we're heading towards Mars! Planet Earth is racing toward Mars at a speed of 23,500 mph, which means the red planet is getting bigger and brighter by the very minute! In October, when the two planets are closest together, Mars will outshine everything in the night sky except Venus and the Moon!  We will be able to spot polar ice caps and dust storms and strange dark markings! The pictures taken will be absolutely incredible!
And last, but certainly not least, check this out.
Coldplay's new album, (fucking beautiful and oh, so brilliant!) X & Y. Obviously, it was supposed to be ""W,X,& Y"" right?! Okay, maybe not.
Right in the middle of me having fun, the album comes out and well, here are the lyrics to the first song...

ive figured it out! finally, ive figured it out.
maybe im losing my mind, but whatever this is that has taken over me, it feels really, rrrrreally good.
things in this world have been really, really bad. like not kinda bad. really, really fucking bad. but that only means good is on its way. and the worse things get, then the better the future will be.
we are about to be overwhelmed with so muh love and understanding. we are about to be involved in the greatest age ever to be alive. the new world order is not going to be militant. we're soon to see that anything is possible. human consciousness is PURE POTENTIALITY (duh!). the renaissance is just around around the corner...
so get ready. be prepared. dont try and fight it. its on its way. open yourself up and let it flow in. love is spreading her arms. and you'll see when you accept it that LOVE is the ONLY thing that works.
trust me on this. im right (like freakin always). have i ever steered you wrong before?"

the attacks will not stop on INNOCENT civilians, which is a brilliant move, because their lives are AMERICA'S responsibility.
THE HUMAN SPIRIT WILL PREVAIL ONE DAY AND THIS WILL BE A WORLD OF PEACE, LOVE, AND UNDERSTANDING!!!

For him, the human being, it's sad to see him go, but his death should be celebrated because it hurts Christianity.  Christianity is dying as more and more people are seeing how godless of a world this is.  His death was seen as the passing of a pop-icon, NOT the leader of a stupid, dying religion.
So celebrate his death for it's a step closer to the death of Christianity!

The government believes the dirty thugs of Al-Queda are planning an attack ""that will either rival or exceed September 11."" The US will not stand for this threat and begin with ""Operation Jesus Love,"" which is aimed to take out Australia through supreme Jesus-like force. Bush stated at the Pentagon, ""It's like fair to say enough from here there is goin to be a triple terror in my skies. With the freedoms we Americans cherish, the goal will continue to be ridding the world of all evil with the help of God through Operation Jesus Love."" It has become clear with starking evidence that Australians, though helpful in the liberation of Iraqi's, have been hiding members of Al-queda in their scum seas with Iraqi scuba gear, which gives reason to believe Iraq's WMD's may have been hidden deep in those seas. In today's poll, 83% of Americans agree we should take out the Australian threat. 98% of the world vehemently disagrees, but President Bush has assured us that those 98% are people who hate freedom with a passion."

Life is hard...real fucking hard, confusing, stupid, at times entertaining and even quite interesting sometimes and then back to harsh reality.
But you can't give up.
You can't ever ever ever ever give up.
If you do, fine.  But you'll only regret it and get yourself into a deeper hole.
Nothing is more satisfying than setting a goal, sticking to it, and accomplishing it, then moving on to the next.
Stupid little petty bullshit is going to get in your way so you gotta say fuck that, piss on it, and keep goin.
Things may seem impossible and then they may seem completely insignicant.  But god damnit damnit, they aren't! Just dont give fucking up and good things are going to happen and you're going to really enjoy the feeling.  Getting down on yourself is dumb.  If you fuck up, fix it and/or move on.  Don't keep thinking about it...just move the fuck on.

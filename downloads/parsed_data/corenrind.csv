"event","Yesterday I took the R train to meet Evan after work at the Housing Works Bookstore Cafe. There was a girl on the subway platform that I knew I knew, but why? Does she work in my office building? No. Does she work in a store I go to? No. She is a waitress around the corner from Evan's in Brooklyn. For all I knew that was where she was headed on this very R train. The first couple times she was our waitress I didn't like her because she was crabby, but the last couple times she was our waitress I did like her because she was really nice, and I forgave her the other times because brunch is bonkers. How would I handle brunch if I was a waitress? Terrible.

I wanted to say hello to her on the platform, but I didn't. ""Hi, you are a waitress!"" Plus she was talking to a man. I didn't want to say ""Hi you are a waitress?"" and be a flirt ruiner and then she would be crabby waitress for every time. After a couple stops, though, the man left the train. Should I say hi? Then she took <em>Welcome to the Monkey House</em> by Kurt Vonnegut out of her bag. Now I really want to say hi!! I only had one stop left. I took my headphones out of my ears. But I thought about what to in fact say and it was silly, and I thought about everyone on the train deciding if it was weird or not, and her thinking about it for the rest of her ride to work when she really just wants to read a book.

If I had read that book, I'd have said that. I thought about lying and saying I had. I <em>could</em> read that book. My life is very similar to what it would be if I <em>had</em> read that book. Right?

Today I took the R train to meet Evan after work at the Housing Works Bookstore Cafe. It's not a trick! I didn't get to stay yesterday, and I have been in the mood for impulsive books. I may have begun stalking Evan's laundry room on days I am not doing laundry. I love seeing what books people leave on the table in there. You can tell who they belonged to, in a way. Someone's bucketload of chick lit. And all those dramas about the Tudors. Yesterday, when I went out for half-and-half, I checked and it was a stack of New York Law Review, like dude, no.

But on the subway today I stood at the end of the car because I was not going very far. Someone stood up and a man next to me offered me the seat before he chose to seat himself. I said it was okay and I knew I knew him. But why? He was a deli guy for sure. Which deli guy has glasses? From the bagel place? No. Pizza place? No, the one where I get milk for work. He is the one who seems crabby a lot, but then when there is a problem with the card he says it's okay and I can take the milk and come pay later, and I do. So he has to know me, right? Am I going crazy and this city is full of doubles? I became awkward and turned to the door and tapped my foot to music in my headphones instead.

<a href=""http://www.housingworks.org/bookstore"">The bookstore</a> is nice. I have somehow never been there before this week, and I love <a href=""http://corenrind.livejournal.com/2010/01/12/"">used bookstores</a>. Oh well. It's great. Next time I feel like I need something from the laundry room I will also go and consider their cheap shelves. Where I will find, for instance, <em>Welcome to the Monkey House</em>. Right away like magic. I presume it is. $1.64 later I took it and the book with this title: <em>Plays Pleasant and Unpleasant, Vol. I: Unpleasant Plays</em> by G.B. Shaw. Obviously!

Here is the thing: I want to know what on earth will happen if I take the R train after work to Housing Works <em>tomorrow</em>, too. I don't think I'm <em>going</em> to, though I want to see more magic. Because there's a lot of work to do. And today we walked through Manhattan all night instead, and saw the sun set. And because I'm still not as full of spirit when luck will have it as I wish. Yet."

"event","I've been trying to borrow all of my sister's books. She is moving, soon, and theoretically also her things are moving, soon, from my apartment. This is probably a good thing, except for the ways it isn't. Her guitars make my living room look way cooler. She's got good books. And normally, almost nothing is really in the way, because the reason you've always heard jokes about closet space in New York apartments is because they apparently put all of those closets in <i>my</i> apartment. Also I love her.

I don't need to read every book. But I suddenly keep thinking of more I should try, with fewer and fewer weeks left. This one she got at the Book Barn last month. The Vonnegut I read years ago. Barack Obama's? That one on top of that pile that's been helping block that yarn project pinned on the floor that seriously I should finish. For instance.

She's occasionally borrowed books from me, and she's such fun to talk about them with. We get excited in complementary ways. She asks for books for plane trips and school breaks, and sets me to my bookcases with tantalizing guidelines: I'd like something funny but not YA; I'd like something serious but not too old; GOD DAMN IT I LEFT MY COPY OF <i>WATERSHIP DOWN</i> ON MY BED, what else is like <i>Watership Down</i>. Methodical, meditative scans of my shelves for the exact right thing to spend one's time with are one of my best happinesses.

I've been thinking we can devise some kind of borrow-by-mail book club so we don't have to give this up. We can print online postage for Media Mail and reuse the same package until one of the books bites it. Long-distance collaboration. She is a reluctant internetter, but has begun starring things on Goodreads, which just makes the world feel like a better place. It can be done.

But the most important one, for now, was to read the copy of <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/63354918""><i>Everything Is Illuminated</i></a> that I bought her four years ago. She read it at the end of 12th grade and loved it so much that she started over when she finished, but had to return it to the library and was disappointed to. She said the ending made her wonder, made her have to choose, and she wanted to know what to choose. She had rather a lot to choose, then. So I gave it for her graduation present. I've meant to read it this whole time she's been here, but this new graduation gave me the <i>right</i> time.

I gave her <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/257164347"">a perfect book</a> this time around, too. About staying found.

Graduation gifts, I have learned, are really fun to give."

"event","Last night when my sister told me her final grade in Physics, I jumped for joy and screamed and stomped and yelled. Intermittently for hours. Just crazily.

Around 5:00 this morning, I woke up from a dream that she was a baby again, and I was a kid, and we were riding the subway. I was trying to make her laugh, and she called me ""<i>cute!</i>"", and it was her first word.

A few hours later when I went to my subway stop to catch the train, a woman staggered out with a bleeding mouth, yelling with anger. She took a bloody spit on the sidewalk and no one around could measure what was happening. I put enough pieces together to ask ""What happened?"" as she went by, but she just kept on moving. It was like no one was there.

Nothing really to say about them. Just wanted to say."

"event","Last week I was having one of those awful days that is much too full, and I woke up wishing it was already over. I was basically doomed, a half hour behind all day, the kind of behind where you can foresee that the next ten hours are a parade of people wondering why you hadn't done something or other already, no matter what thing you rush off to next.

And I rushed off to a thing, and on the subway had to humbly shove pieces of a scone into my face, which was lunch. And even though sometimes the subway is host to a sort of zen of timeliness -- <i>this delay is profoundly outside my control, and I will read my book</i> -- it was not one of those times, or not at first. I somehow became distressed by how quickly my head was able to chew food. <i>Why is this the maximum pace at which I can masticate? Can't I please skip to the part where the scone is just making me no longer hungry?</i>

Then of course, what had to happen to the universe happened, and the train got stuck. Actually, it was fine, but the one ahead had its emergency brake pulled (which is <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/nyregion/19brake.html"">usually a bad idea</a>) and my train couldn't go on, but it could go to another station and pretend to be a different train. I decided to go along with it. I went to the zen and read my book. It was okay. But I looked at the time and it was time for me to arrive at my destination, and I was still 18 stops from my destination, which is very, very, very far away. So. Without letting myself think about it too hard, I got out at Canal, and made an excuse, and took another train right exactly home. And I got into bed. And read my book. And somehow felt like I'd averted a disaster. I even took a nap. Then I woke up and did laundry, in order to do something right that day.

There have been a lot of things in the last couple weeks, and they go like this right now. The painful wrench of stress in your chest that keeps you awake at night, but makes you clean the kitchen. 

I keep noticing subway rides being my humbling pie. I'm reading <i>Everything Is Illuminated</i>, where Alex likes to say ""another slice of humble pie."" A bite of humble scone.

I rode home one night and I was <i>pretty sure</i> I was the saddest person on the train. I'd had some rough ones and I was raw and weepy and exhausted. Then, I saw a very small boy in real life drop his ice cream cone on the subway floor, ridiculously upside down with the pointy end jauntily up, just like every cartoon ever made. And he was so horrified, wailed and wailed with loss, scrunched his eyes shut and hot tears, and his dad picked him up and sorta smiled just a little, because what can you say, and everyone else smiled at him <i>just</i> a little. And I decided that he was having a worse night than me.

The <i>next</i> night, I foundered some plans and tried to stem a crisis, in the modern sense where what you're really doing is three and a half sudden hours of searches on poorly-architectured websites, thirteen tabs open, copy-pasting into emails, frantic Google Calendar checks. Afterward it was midnight, and nothing was really fixed. Rather than go to bed bitter, I decided to leave and I got on the subway absurdly late, feeling like a ruin. And a couple stops after mine, a man came on and sat and asked me, ""This train goes back and forth all night?"" And he was also having a worse night than me.

A couple mornings ago, a baby girl with twelve fingers in a pink fuzzy jacket. And a woman standing by the subway doors in a cool blue dress wearing Converse, who that same evening passed me on the street in SoHo. It's love and lonesomeness.

But I think the stink of these weeks is airing out. Nothing is permanent, and I mean <i>you</i>, bullshit. There is <i>so much</i> about to happen, and I think it will look much better now. I think the part where the change is full of pain and worry is nearly through, and most of what's left is the doing. And I'm gonna have a lot to say about it."

"event","When I'm alone at night, my apartment gets cold like a castle. Even if the temperature isn't low, something cold soaks through the air from the outside. This strange un-freezing winter we've had has barely triggered the radiator here. It's been one of comforters and layers and teacups instead, but I miss the snow badly. I don't care what you say! I don't care when it's on the streets. I have Kmart boots just like the rest of you.

I don't live very far from Coney Island now, and I thought all summer of going to see the beach under desolate, beautiful snow. I love going out for walks when it's falling. Evan and I always talked about doing this together, yet now that we're in the same place, it hasn't snowed. Four melty inches all winter. I fiercely believe there should be blizzards near Valentine's Day, at the very least. You wake up and it's there.

But instead it's been warm, this week especially, and I'm starting to understand that it just isn't happening this time. And that I can like the difference. I do. So I will tell a story about epic happiness.

On Tuesday it was an off-the-chart, crayon-up-the-wall day of bliss, ten out of ten. I beamed all day, grinning giddy at my desk and on the street. I could hardly stop. I said, Liz stop it. This happiness came certainly from one particular dot on the earth, but was carried anyway by all of life: the beatific weather, the finishing of excellent books, an album on repeat. The happiness took my mind away from all of these things, and then sweeping again back up the shore.

On Wednesday I would see the someone I missed, and it felt like he was not only returning that day but to every other day there is going to be. When he did, we went out, and came back, and made dinner, and held hands as we ate, late at night.

Some days just let themselves."

"event","My little pet fish died last night. I knew there was something wrong, noticed her lose her swimming through the week, hanging out at the bottom of her tank. Yesterday I discovered the source of the poisonous gunk, some kind of deposit behind the filter. I went to work and cleaned everything, but over the next hour I watched her die anyway. 

Though, first I dreamt of a reward of perseverance. I got a small cup ready so she'd be nearer to gulp the air. I reached in and gently laid a half a pea right up against her mouth, not sure when she last ate. I ate the other half myself. Her normal food floats so I needed one that sank. I'd used a pea to make her better when she had a swim bladder problem, stuck at the top of the water instead of the bottom. That time I'd devised a hanging-paper-clip pea-delivery system. I am still proud of it. (I know the internet is divided on the pea issue. Leave me alone, internet fish opinions. I was a hero.)

I didn't get emotional about any of this until I saw her flat on her side, breathing too slowly like a horse in a movie about to get shot on a beach. I saw her give a final push, and open and close her mouth very wide twice, and go still. She didn't move when I picked her up in the net, and she failed the ""I am lifting you out of the water, do you care?"" test.

Since I never had a fish before, I've never had a dead fish before. So I considered both, but went with something in between a flush and a lovely flower planted with the remains in a decorative pot. I wrote her name on a piece of nice paper, put her in a nice bag with it and the pea and some gravel, and played the song I named her for, and breathed on her until she was warm. All winter I've felt bad that my room isn't warmer. I don't know.

Lately I'm getting weepy for 90% of anything related to any feeling, anyway. When a kid on an ABC Family show sinks a free-throw. So. What can I do.

When I went to bed, I still hadn't emptied the fish tank of water and plants and gravel. It sat there full and unfortunate. I opened my book and read the chapter in <em>Wild</em> where she makes it to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_Lake"">Crater Lake</a>, and sees it as ""<a href=""http://therumpus.net/2010/11/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-55-the-empty-bowl/"">the empty bowl</a>,"" her term for her grief. But after; profoundly full, un-emptied. Two thousand feet deep.

Once when we were first friends, Meg explained a problem to me by saying, ""The thing was not the thing."" Though a seemingly daffy expression, I've actually said this to myself a lot since, to justify that feeling. The thing that you must deal with in front of you, and the thing that is your problem. There are so often two things at least. The thing is not the little lifeless creature, or the too-full tank of water, it is the empty bowl to fill."

"event","It&#39;s familiar for city people, particularly New York people, to see places you know in movies that you watch. Sometimes it&#39;s because it&#39;s a famous place, or sometimes it&#39;s just because randomly they have chosen the coffee shop next to your school to film this here scene. Which is nice, because you never actually went to this coffee shop because a single coffee there costs $4. The one time you did go there to meet a professor, you ordered nothing and stared at her eight-inch cappuccino pretty much 100% of the time.<br /><br />The other thing that happens though is that sometimes you&#39;re me? And you&#39;re losing your mind. And you don&#39;t know! What happens to me is that I just don&#39;t remember, <i>really</i>, although I do. I know what that is, where it is, but I don&#39;t. I&#39;ve been here before, before this Argo Tea was an Argo Tea. But what <i>was</i> it? Why did Argo Tea erase my memory? And why is it named after the Greek with 100 eyes?<br /><br />But, so. I watched <i>Margin Call</i>, <a href=""http://oscar.go.com/nominees/writing-original-screenplay/margin-call"">it&#39;s a movie</a>. A Wall Street movie, so it&#39;s set in the Financial District. <a href=""http://corenrind.livejournal.com/2001/"">I used</a> <a href=""http://corenrind.livejournal.com/2002/"">to</a> <a href=""http://corenrind.livejournal.com/2003/"">live</a> <a href=""http://corenrind.livejournal.com/2004/"">there</a>! Mostly the movie is a scene in an office. x 2. A scene in a boardroom. x 2. One monologue on a Brooklyn stoop. A scene in an office again. A scene in a restaurant I think is also part of the office.<br /><br />However they&#39;re outside this one time, on a coffee break of defeat. Here is proof. It is a terrible photo I took of my television!<div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7189/6821816582_dc757deb18_z.jpg"" /><br /><b><i>Coffee break of defeat</i></b></div><br />And I think? That I <i>actually</i> used to live there. As soon as Kevin Spacey was slouching there I knew I was standing next to him at some point, the two-tier bushes and the things that look like sprinklers but are lights actually. The stone, and that building behind it, yes, once I was there <i>all the time</i>. But where? Across the street from my building, actually, I thought. But it doesn&#39;t quite look right when I reality-check on a map. But which is the righter. What is missing?<br /><br />Anyway, I liked this movie. I wanted to watch it in order to watch its screenplay. That sounds redundant, but I like movies that you watch for the writing, that you may think you watch for Zachary Quinto, but you are tricked! It is actually the writing making you want to know what they are going to be feeling in the next scene! The way that Paul Bettany is perpetually going to explode every single second but he does not, not even one time! You&#39;re tense, but you&#39;re tense for them, because you know exactly what happens next. Even when they fight about it you know they&#39;ll still decide to, because it happened already, in your life and in my old neighborhood, this occurred.<br /><br />I think so often about the thematic strength of real life, of real time. Time passing is more than nonfiction. Just wait, and it does in fact mean something, simply because of what has happened already. I even write this down sometimes, how obvious it seems, but writing it has not yet worked any insightful magic. I just feel like I know that things happened in order. An order. Sometimes I joke that I like to gossip, but it is simply that I like true stories. What people do. I like history too, and it&#39;s because it&#39;s the same. It happened between people who told each other things that occurred.<br /><br />I suppose it&#39;s just that this is strength that I want. You see. To grab and use and hold. The rightness and the realness. It is strong enough."

"event","Today I spent my afternoon identifying a bird. Which wasn't how I intended to spend the afternoon. I was hoping to spend it holed up in a studio apartment, maybe trying to write, probably reading a book instead. But I forgot my laptop cord back at my apartment, and had to leave.

When I came back out of my building to get on the subway again, I saw this bird? Just standing around like a pigeon, and I like pigeons so I went closer, and then it was not a pigeon at all. For one thing, it was freaked. This bird had a brain and it was thinking something like, ""No no no no no no no."" It was trying to decide a direction to go, but was so lost it was barely covering any ground. It kept turning to a doorway into the construction site next door, which was closed.

And it also looked nothing like a pigeon. But I noticed this last. It was bigger, fatter, with an eye mask, a bright beak, and black & white-stripe wings. I, however, simply wanted to see what its deal was. It was so clearly in the wrong place, but what could I do? I just went closer. It finally took notice and started sidling away. But it was frustrated. It went towards my front door, a dead end. Then toward the street, as a car left the curb, and turned again. It didn't fly.

I've been reading Cheryl Strayed's hiking memoir <em>Wild</em>, and it made me think of the way she calls every animal she sees on her trip by its name. Hello lizard, cow, cow, cow. Once, distracted by a charging bull, moose. What I really wanted was a conversation. ""Bird, are you okay? What is your primary area of concern?"" But it just kept walking away, down the sidewalk, entirely like a lost person, but opposite the way I was going. I decided not to follow the bird all day. Because that would be silly, right? Why do I do things.

Anyway, a couple hours later <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Alectoris-chukar-001.jpg"">what I had was a Chukar</a>. (I ultimately figured this out through <a href=""http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Chukar/id/ac"">the Cornell lab</a>, plus lots of Wikiing its relatives.) It's an Asian partridge that is used for game in the U.S., and has basically no reason to be in New York City. Some of the game populations have gone wild in the Rockies, but that couldn't really happen here. They can live on rock (good) but not at sea-level humidity (bad).

I suppose the point, that interested me so much, was knowing it could be anything, and end up on my street for any reason. That is basically what this town is like, for everything. Ornithology -- and so much else? -- seems to be essentially based on the idea that everything is normal, that things are in the place they belong, the bird is basically where it's supposed to be, but this just clearly wasn't. I wanted to tell the websites, you don't understand, this was <em>in Brooklyn!</em> 

One of them was <a href=""http://gothamist.com/2011/10/05/second_spotting_of_hipster_bird_pos.php"">spotted six months ago</a> in another neighborhood, but I don't know what happened to it. <a href=""http://10000birds.com/chukar-on-the-loose.htm"">They've been seen</a> near the city before. And, indeed, <a href=""http://www.ringneckpreserve.com/"">you can hunt them</a> upstate. People do keep unusual birds here, to raise or fight or sacrifice. <a href=""http://redhookchickenguy.com/"">Hipster farmers</a> keep chickens on their garden-apartment patios. I've seen turkeys in more than one park that appear to be wild, but who knows where they've come from. I've seen a rooster in a park in Harlem that looked just as lost, if not as exotic. The idea that in New York City no one is too odd is true. People just bring what they are.

The Chukar is the national bird of Pakistan, and <a href=""http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924070625847#page/n283/mode/2up"">a symbol of unrequited love</a>, <a href=""http://www.indiayogi.com/content/full-moon-festival/overview.aspx"">said to pine for the moon</a>. You see. <em>Now</em>, my bird, you are talking my language."

"event","Lately I've noticed my age a lot. It seems fine, actually. Younger people around you, they suddenly get smarter and super interesting. How could that be bad? I keep finding myself in awesome situations in which I am the oldest person around. Not too long from now I'll be trading one decade for another, again. I am so ready for this bargaining table.

Last weekend I saw a picture that Evan took of me and noticed I now have eye crinkles. And my response was to say, ""Oh look! I have eye crinkles!!"" I guess that's all it is. Plus another thing or two. What my sister calls ""the phylogenetic tree of decisions."" I think I'm fitting a lot onto this page that's turning.

It definitely isn't all keen mature shit, however. For instance, I've recently become scared of the dark! Not generally ""the dark,"" really, but I'm lately a little anxious falling asleep alone in my apartment, where there is comfort and nothing to fear, and nothing bad happens. But now it's the yips of sleeping. Indeed, sleeping arrangements have been quite ""under construction"" all year, and now most nights are with a dear body, and some are without. The latter have presented me a charming psychoanalytic bubble to burst.

And, sometimes it is still cookies for breakfast. Dreams that come true, children.

But, you must have faith in your companions. I am sure that if anything bad turned up, at least in the vicinity of my dresser, my tiny little fish would try attacking it for me. Also if anything good turned up, or anything neutral as well. That is basically the option. She's born to fight to the death. When she's following my finger around the side of the tank, though, I pretend that it's nice and we call it ""twirlies.""

But, so, I shouldn't worry. I'm not alone. The filter it bubbles reassuringly through the night. The fish she sleeps, I think, though I've never seen it, though I've tried to sneak up on her when it looks like she is, except she'll notice and zip over for action. The smallest and deadliest one. I picked her for these qualities. Mostly the first one. And that she was hidden behind a pole. And I felt bad for the betta girls.

I've slept with a light on more than once, I confess. Two clicks of the lamp feels ok. I also own a nightlight, for absurdly lengthy monthlong-bathroom-repair reasons, but it isn't much. Even the fish tank has a light-switch which I call Disco Fishy, but which I don't leave on for longer than it takes to do one's daily scum-check. Which is a good custom. We should all adopt it.

It's just. One good thing I've noticed this year is that I have a little more to say to everyone. So, let's see about that."

This year, half over with, has been just starts and ends. Not in that order. Though it's hard to tell, as they're strange bedfellows. Do you belong to the old or the new?

I don't really know how to mark the time, but there's new things, and they're well.

The first day it became real, we sat in the cold on a park bench at the Cloisters, to talk it through. I made many sad faces. And while we sat together I noticed a big hawk was sitting right in front of us on a tree branch, so we ended up watching it until it flew off. Then we got up, to get warm.

Another day some weeks later I was in Central Park at night, on a path near the edge on my way to the train. I was happier. I sat down on another park bench and called him, and looked at a pond in the dark, not The Pond but a different pond. Something told me I should look behind me and I was two seconds of frightened. But a family of raccoons looked back at me, and they were also two seconds of frightened, and then we all sort of smiled and carried on. Three or four of them appeared and picked about in the weeds around the western wall, and down to the path in front of me. One hopped the little fence over to the water. One began to jump around like a jackrabbit, in the light under a lamppost, just for fun.

(And a couple months later, we saw some bears in the mountains, but it didn't mean anything. It just was neat.)

I moved to a new neighborhood, about as serene as New York City manages to get, which is a nice change. My last neighborhood was loud with people, and the neighborhood before was loud with traffic. This one clings together with folksy rowhouses, kids playing behind gaudy chrome fences, and Brooklyn's finest multiculturalism. I feel the best in places like this because it's nice having the idea that everyone else feels fine there, too, all of them. Everybody seems to live there and nobody seems hassled. They just grocery shop and bring their trash cans to the curb. All of it seems to be growing and changing and stretching at the slower pace of urban evolution that you can't find in Manhattan any more, the kind driven by people and not profit.

This month some fruit flies were also living here in my apartment. I devoted a lot of time to them. I set up some spa retreats. They were jaded NYC fruit flies and didn't really want to swim in the honey and mess up their hair, just hang out there together. I think they came because I was still used to taking out the garbage like when there's other people in the house (""when it is full."") Now I have agreed upon a new schedule (""Wednesdays."") I adjusted. Also, I got a much healthier pet and don't need disenchanted fruit flies.

I ride over the bridge every day to work, again, on the train. It's become important to me to do my best to look at the water when I do this. Hopefully both times, especially if one of them is in the morning and one of them is in the dark. Even if it's a crowded car or I'm sitting in an awkward seat on the wrong side. It's also best if I can find part of the water that's moving, so I crane my head like a tourist and scan for a ripple or the wake of a boat. And then I think, good, got it, and go back to my book.

Something should be said for when you're on the subway with little kids who react to the moment the train exits the tunnel into daylight as if Tinkerbell has just revealed fairyland to them. It does not seem to matter that they're only seeing a sooty bridge and oily harbor, or the concrete ravine along the tracks by my house. Underground, I'm wishing they'd be quiet (I'm reading here!) but then they say Wow. I agree.

I've been reading <i>Moby-Dick</i>. It's <a href=""http://corenrind.livejournal.com/2002/07/23/"">not the first time</a> I've tried. Actually I believe it's the fourth. That's many times. Can I get a punch card for this book? Soon, though, I'll pass further into it than I've been before. I'm not sure exactly when that is, but I'm close. And, despite some wow factor, I'm not sure yet how much I like reading it, but what I do know I like is making connections: looking up from the book to look at that water under the bridge on the train, see the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_(ship)"">Peking</a> docked down at the pier, which I used to walk to and stare at for ages during college, when I lived a couple blocks from where Melville was born. It's as close as I can get.

I bought a fishbowl for my new apartment. And a little fish for it. It's not quite the same, but I like her."

"event","Yesterday, I went to an art supply store.  It is next door to an expensive art school.  Inside, there were employees, being cool.


BEARDED ART STUDENT
Question. Which band do you like more albums by, the Pixies or the Breeders?

REGULAR ART STUDENT
I'm gonna be honest with you?  I haven't really heard any Breeders albums.  So, the Pixies.

BEARDED ART STUDENT
You should fix that, because I would say the Breeders.

REGULAR ART STUDENT
Well... You know what you should do is make <em>copies</em> of your Breeders albums, and <em>give</em> them to me.  For backup.

BEARDED ART STUDENT
In case I ever lose my music collection?

REGULAR ART STUDENT
Right.

BEARDED ART STUDENT
You wouldn't <em>listen</em> to them.

REGULAR ART STUDENT
Nope.  I'm not listening to them <em>right now</em>.

LIZ
LOL / This conversation is happening / LOL

I was shopping there for 4x6-foot foam core boards because we need new ones at work.


COWORKER
Liz, can you figure out how to get some new presentation boards delivered?

LIZ
Internet, can you figure out how to get some new presentation boards delivered?

INTERNET
Yes!  Sort of.  Do you want 25?

LIZ
No.  I want 3.

INTERNET
I can offer you 25.

LIZ
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Fine.

INTERNET
The delivery fee will be $55.

LIZ
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Fine.

INTERNET
They will be delivered to your address at curbside.

LIZ
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . They what?

INTERNET
The <em>inside</em> delivery fee will be $85.

LIZ
LOL / This conversation is happening / LOL

.

So I'm in the store talking to the Breeders fan.


LIZ
Hi. Do you have the board size that I want?

BREEDERS FAN
Yes!  Sort of.  Do you want a completely different size?

LIZ
Ugh.

BREEDERS FAN
I can offer you a completely different size.

LIZ
Sigh.

BREEDERS FAN
I can cut it to the size you want for $2 a cut.

LIZ
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Do you deliver?

BREEDERS FAN
No.

.

So I'm back at my desk with a courier quote, a calculator, and an email draft authorizing the internet to bill me $85 to take the freight elevator.  I simply want 3 foam boards to arrive.  This is all.  And some low-tack tape.  I'm not worried about the tape.  But it's in the mix.  

What costs more per board?  To purchase 25 foam boards plus tax that are delivered for $85 or to purchase 3 foam boards that are 2 feet bigger than they should be and cost an additional $2 to reduce them to the smaller, less valuable size that no one keeps in stock, and messenger them 8 blocks?  And at what quantity does one really stupid solution become more cost-effective than the other?

And other questions with really dumb answers.

I will probably go back to buy the drafting tape from the Breeders fan.  So he didn't entirely lose every argument he had that day.

.

This was not the only bizarro math I did yesterday either.  Oh no.  The second half of my day was spent inspecting 2011 health insurance plans, doing the math of how to be screwed.  In what way would I recommend we be screwed?  Under what circumstances would each plan screw the least, and what probabilities they arise?

In fact it upset me so much I made a graph.


<img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1138/5108908245_362c1daf43.jpg"" alt=""aaaugh"">


This is pretty good even for me.  I have spreadsheeted to resolve my feelings before, but never in a plotting data points kind of way.  I'll accept the development.

.

Additionally, earlier I had made a deposit at the bank and forgot to carry a 1 on the deposit slip.

"event","Lately, before I wake up in the morning, I am having dreams about the internet.  For instance, in real life I have this browser window with like 33 tabs open, ignored at the bottom of my screen.  For like two weeks it's been there.  I don't want to finish researching!  Don't make me!  But then, I dreamed that I quit the program by mistake, and the tabs were all gone now, <i>great job Liz!</i>  That was a bad dream.  The other day, I dreamed that someone who never emails me emailed me.  That was a good dream.  I've dreamed about getting lost in badly-architectured UIs.  I've dreamed about comment threads that don't exist, and what I wish would be said in them, or what I'm afraid would be said in them.

Frequently in these dreams, I send an email and realize afterward that I should have corrected something, <em>but I have never turned on the ""Undo Send"" Gmail Labs option, so what am I going to do??</em>  Tragic.  In real life I have never needed this (I tend to over-edit), but I fail to account for writing in my dreams.  The other day I was telling the story of how in college often when I pulled all-nighters to write a paper, I would hit the excruciating wall around 4:30am and desperately drift off to sleep, <em>while sitting up and typing</em>, and snap awake to find I had written a string of bizarre subconscious free association.  And because that is the worst feeling in the world, I would simply groan and hit backspace, which I deeply regret, as I'm sure I would find these curlicues hilarious if I had them.  Ctrl-Z that one I tell you.

Well, now I just want a nap."

"event","Yesterday I went with Chris to get his eyes checked at an optical, because he really needs new glasses.  I also need new glasses.  We went to a few and I tried some on frownfully.  Unfortunately, my <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/tizzie/2408111663/"">glasses</a> are perfect.  This is a huge problem.  Nothing is anywhere near as good.

<ul><li>They are blue on the inside</li><li>They are the exact right shape</li><li>They are black but not so like I look like I'm in a comic book</li><li>These cute little studs in the corners, I don't know, I love them ok</li></ul>
They are perhaps the tiniest smidge too narrow for me.  That is the only suggestion that could be made.

But they're in bad shape.  Forget about the lenses, there is a map of the world filigreed on those.  But the frames, the architecture is crumbling.  The plastic is dull.  Five years of NYC grimes all the crevices.  I imagine wandering into a shop and meeting a friendly optician who is only too happy to fix these problems for me, but I think that is just a dream.  They shoot horses don't they.

I have been doing this task a lot lately, replacing a lot of 5-8 year old things.

<ul><li>wallet</li><li>computer</li><li>bathrobe</li><li>swimsuit</li><li>cartoonish iPod case</li></ul>
I guess as you get older you need to be reminded to hit refresh once in a while.  But then the letting go.

I also need a haircut.

While we were out, we took the subway to <a href=""http://ny.eater.com/archives/2010/08/poptarts_world_times_square.php"">Pop Tarts World</a>, of course in the Times Square area.  I'd been grocery shopping in the morning and made an impulse buy and Chris thought it would be funny.  We left Pop Tarts World immediately, but it was funny enough.  There is a big counter, swirling lights, and a silkscreen t-shirt station.  Plenty of stuff for sale.  All I could think of were people coming here on vacation and being told to go there, and then coming home with something to show people, and saying, ""This is from Pop Tarts World! In New York they have a whole store just for Pop Tarts!""  As if this isn't the weirdest thing in the world.

We walked to <a href=""http://www.bookoffusa.com/"">a used bookstore</a> near Bryant Park.  Chris bought some movies.  I went upstairs to look at their floor of Japanese books, which was great.  If you will never be able to travel anywhere in your whole entire life, may I suggest visiting a store where all around you cannot tell what any of the things are called.  Earlier, we'd looked for an optical in Koreatown, which is basically one block of one street near my office, packed with businesses even for midtown, Korean signs jutting from every window.

On the way home, there was a man acting on the subway.  Rehearsing into his reflection in the window of the sliding doors.  I spied on the script to see if he was doing two parts, but it looked like just a long speech.  There are so many theater people who live in Inwood.  I hear them on the train all the time, usually bragging to each other.

It's all I can do."

"event","Last weekend Chris's friend Mike turned 30.  He's the first of our kind to make it there.  Chris and Mike have been friends since grade school.  Something about a 4th grade field trip and Mike's dad was a chaperon.  Mike likes to give hugs, which is good.  Something I have been surprised by as I have gotten older is that I am a hugger.  I may want to hug you tighter or longer than you're interested in being hugged.  Just, y'know, grunt or something.

And I hold myself back!  I do.

Anyway Mike came to town and they played a while and I found them with one of Mike's friends at a Mexican place after a margarita ""birthday cake"".  So they were completely adorable by this point.  Mike decided that he wanted one of those warm brownies with ice cream.  Which I think you're allowed to ask for on your 30th birthday.  So we 75% drunkenly skipped off to look at the menu of every restaurant near Union Square, which is about 80% restaurants, to find him this brownie, which of course establishments with any morale will not have.  I was the one most focused on this task, because I was the soberest, but it was also just very important to me to get him this brownie, I had to do it.  Finally I noticed the T.G.I. Friday's now on the eastern rim of the park and I made everyone troop in, embarrassed, and it was totally empty because come on, and we got the brownie and it was delicious and we were charged $11 for coffee and we paid.  It was a happy birthday.

Then I got a really bad cold and half of this week I've stayed home sick.  I took long naps and made oatmeal and watched <i>The Shining</i>.  Because... that's what you do I guess.  I missed the first half hour, so combine this with the time I saw the beginning in 11th grade when my terrible substitute English teacher thought we should watch it* and I finally dropped the class that same day, I guess I've seen <i>The Shining</i>.

I am still not over that guy and the time he got around our reading requirement by reading Cliff's Notes aloud to us and he spoiled the end to <i>Of Mice and Men</i> for me.  I will tell you about it forever.

* Other videos we watched in the first couple weeks instead of learning about Modern Writers: professional boxing, <i>Friday</i>, <i>National Lampoon's Senior Trip</i>, a Cheech and Chong movie I can't remember.

The other night when I couldn't sleep I got out of bed and made a necklace.  Out of buttons.  By tying them on a string.  For me to wear.  It's even cute.  I was feasting on $3 Etsy necklaces last week and I thought, <i>I could probably make that myself.</i>  A famous mistake.  I'm worried about this making of jewelry, because I think it is approaching the hobby category soon, and it was for a long time one of my last stones left unturned in the crazy crafter lady lexicon.  I guess I have rounded that bend.  Have you ever seen the jewelry-making aisle of a Michael's?  It is scary in there.  Those people are crazy.  I went to one in June because I made Meg some earrings for her birthday.  Try to buy something in fewer than 80 pieces, just try.

Tomorrow morning we leave for Atlantic City.  I have wanted to do this for four years, so I've been looking forward to it all summer.  It's my only summer vacation!  This is a dubious honor for the weekend, however, as I don't feel that good, and though it has basically been 100 degrees since May, it is going to be cold on the beach tomorrow.  Which is stupid.  But whatever.  I'll still get kicks, you know.  Pass Go, collect $200.  Mostly if Chris is lucky at the 2/4 table."

"event","Here is a week for you, internet.

Last Saturday I went to Brooklyn to meet <lj user=""thirdbird""> and her small birdlets.  One of you, from the internet!  I don't meet very many internet people these days.  Or very many small people.  My conversation was easily ignored by the children but Thirdbird seemed to like it.  Needs practice though.  The small ones did appreciate my charmed attention whenever they started to dance, which was lots, so that went fine really.

On Tuesday Chris and I went out to dinner.  This never happens, but has happened twice in the past month.  We're working on it.  This time we went to a Thai place I make my coworkers order from all the time because their dumplings are so perfect.  They look like they will be noodley but they are not!  They are firm!  It just makes me feel really good!  Every Monday staff meeting I long for these dumplings and every couple of weeks I make myself choose a different restaurant so I appear to be a person who likes to eat more than one thing for the rest of her life.  But I'm not.  It's my secret.

On the subway ride home, a lady gave me a real life ""psssst-psssst-psssst-psssst!"" when we got on the train.  ""You have excellent taste,"" she said.  I was holding <i>How To Say Goodbye In Robot</i>, which I was only 20 pages into but am eager to share compliments on, so I smiled but noticed she was pointing at her shoes, which were like my shoes, so I laughed.  I do have strong feelings for my shoes.  I have purchased replacements of them.  They are the plainest shoes on earth but I rely on them so much they have given me an interesting looking rectangle tan on my feet this summer.  I told her ""I have that color too!""  I do; hers were blue.  She said, ""Of course!""

Subway people can be good.

That night I couldn't sleep, and I sat up all night until 6:00.  This has happened a few times this summer.  As soon as I decided I was ready to try to go to bed for a while, my cat Lyra became passionately in love with me and began a mewing/<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/tizzie/4765897648/"">headclonk</a> routine.  Her mews are delightful, and it's a shame you will never hear them, because now she always hides from everyone who comes over.  They are so small and they only happen when she is <i>very</i> excited.  Her brother's are loud and weird and sound somehow like a human child and don't make much sense.  His all end with a question mark, ""noww?"" and Lyra's are more like ""<font size=""-2"">meww</font>!!!!!!""

One night last month, she mewed and I woke to her standing on my pillow, licking my bangs furiously.  My bangs, specifically.  I definitely registered that this was hilarious, but was so sleepy I sort of waved my hand and dozed off without doing anything, and I woke up again in a minute and she was still going and going.  Trust me, Lyra, you can fuss over them all you want.

So when I went to bed it was Wednesday morning and Lyra hopped up as soon as I lay down.  She snuggled deep in my side and then said no! this is not enough snuggle for me! so she got up to smosh her head into me so far that it can only be described as doing a somersault, and then she would do the whole thing again.  It was all punctuated with go-to-sleep chin scritches (me) and lick-bites (her), the kind she and her brother always exchange that say, I love you! but I bite you! but I love you! and I bite you!

I just lay there in bed and laughed, because this night was just clearly not in my control.  Then I slept for one hour.

Today I took a proper lunch break, which I almost never do.  Food + extracurricular activity + 60 minutes.  All in one go.  I used to do this all the time.  I got a sandwich and sat in the upstairs of the bagel place.  Between my last two jobs, I've worked on this block for five years and have rung up a kinship with the bagel place.  There's good coffee.  And good bagels almost as good as Murray's by Lang.  Nostalgia-worthy bagels.  I-will-always-remember-you bagels. 

Anyway I took an iced coffee upstairs and ate my whole sandwich, which is like a Thanksgiving feast of a meal, since I usually skip it.  In the book, I read the part where ""Mom flashed me an angry look. She was wearing big, dangling chicken earrings she'd made out of cardboard that day.""  And it was one of those laugh and cry at the same time things, so I just put my hand over my face for a while, and hoped that did the job."

"event","Today we attempted to see a screening of <i>The Great Muppet Caper</i> on a pier in the village.  This is the most superior of the Muppet movies, so this was a good idea.  Unfortunately it did not happen due to storm and tornado watch.  We accepted bags of complementary popcorn as the lightning encroached from uptown, and took our friends home to watch the DVD.

Here are the reasons it is my favorite one.

1. Kermit and Fozzie are the worst journalists.
2. Charles Grodin falls madly for Piggy.
3. Animal shouts, ""RENOIRRR!!!""
4. The John Cleese scene.
5. There are funny songs.
6. And the bike riding.

Raise your hand if your first 1997 web page was all of your favorite Muppet quotes and photos that you found on the internet.  Wait that's only my hand!

Also tonight I realized for the first time that as an adult I talk exactly like Kermit the Frog.  Oh good.

Tomorrow, we are pretending it is Emmy's birthday (it is almost Emmy's birthday) and taking her to Coney Island and the aquarium.  It will be much too hot for this, but what can you do with this summer.  I plan to attend the <a href=""http://www.nyaquarium.com/animals-and-exhibits/animals/fish/giant-pacific-octopus.aspx"">Octopus Chats</a>.  I think we have a lot to talk about.

"event","The last <i>Scott Pilgrim</i> book came out yesterday.  We like those.  On Monday Chris was going to a midnight release to get a copy.  He wanted to go to a store I hadn't been to in years, near the first office I worked in, which is how I found it back then.  Then on Monday afternoon we had a <i>fight</i>, a stupid one, and we fixed it but were sad anyway.

I had a late dinnertime with the good Andrea K. for our biannual visit.  We poked at macaroni and she asked all the right questions.  She is the nicest one; I am lucky to see her.

By 10:30 she had hailed a cab.  I wandered off and found myself on 14th Street so I walked until I found a diner and stopped for a coffee.  It wasn't there when I was in school.  I sat for a little while with a good book I'm reading.

I was about 20 blocks away so I decided to walk to the comics store before 12 and find Chris and make us happy.  20 blocks sounds longer than it is so I walked nice and slowly.  Sweat a little.  Listened to country songs.  It was garbage hour and I walked around lots of it.

For some reason, 33rd Street is like half strip clubs.  In my opinion it's an unlikely spot for strip clubs and I don't really understand it.  There's also a mall and an Old Navy.  Sports bars, the Empire State Building.  And a comic book store.  But those all were closed, except the bookstore, so I moseyed up the all strip club block.  They don't look like old strip clubs, but I might be wrong.  I don't really <i>speak</i> strip club, but you just can tell in other fringes of the old Times Square, when one has just <i>been there</i>.  Sometimes I even like them a little because it survived.  Congratulations, strip club!  Maybe 33rd Street now is just kind of pretending it's 1990, or that everyone misses 1990 or that 1990 will come back.  Like how the conference Andrea is in town attending is really really proud to have booked Naughty By Nature.

Anyway at the comic book store the mellow nerds mingled.  By 12:20 no boyfriends arrived, good or evil.  I waited cutely by the door reading a book about the neighborhood in the 1930s.  I saw a funny photo of a guy in a fedora showing kids how to milk a cow on Madison Avenue.  It isn't on the internet, I'm sorry.

I went out and called Emmy at home.  I'd decided if he changed his mind and was watching Star Trek right now I would kill him.  But he wasn't so I called him.  He said, ""I'm about halfway through the line,"" and I said ""You are??  I'm going back in!"" and he said ""Oh!"" and I hung up.

I was a few beats late: he'd gone somewhere else.  I realized.  So I called him about 17 more times.  But this guy's cell phone.  It is just barely a cell phone.  Like a video game approximation.  One day they're going to stop allowing us to even call it a cell phone, with the cell phones these days. It's like those green monochrome computer monitors of the 80's.  It spells ""phone"" with an f.  It clearly did not survive my hangup.

I'm cursing up 33rd and he comes sprinting down it.

""I'm sorry!""

""I was <i>surprising</i> you.""

""I know!  That's why I ran!!""  He had sped <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=200+West+40th+Street,+NYC+(Midtown+Comics)&daddr=4+West+33rd+Street,+NYC+(Jim+Hanley%27s+Universe)&geocode=FTrebQIdpAiX-ynJFfGlrFnCiTFwFy5OXy3mWg%3BFUnCbQIdFhCX-ymhJGr4qFnCiTFms0opOV1zoQ&hl=en&mra=ls&dirflg=w&sll=40.723844,-74.049225&sspn=0.373635,0.617294&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16"">from Midtown Comics to Jim Hanley's Universe</a>.

Then he said:

""This is basically exactly something that would happen to Scott Pilgrim.""

Then I laughed."

"event","Chris's brother got married this weekend in Connecticut.  We went up and rented a car.  A good experience.  In the train station a woman on our bench showed us pictures of a tranqued baby bear that had been caught in her backyard.  It was little. 

We'd run out of time to buy a card in the city so we went to the Yale Barnes & Noble.  There was a Clinique counter in it.  We got a card anyway.  I wore my weird eBay dress.  It was too hot.  He wore a bow tie.  Bow ties are cool.

The wedding was on a small beach across from their old house.  We spied on it afterward.  We visited The Space.  We visited his mom's grave.  We visited the stuff in self-storage.  I took her sewing kit home.

At dinner I sat next to one of the uncles from Iowa and we talked about his adopting teenage girls, a mutual favorite group.  ""Everyone says girls are so hard, but I think they're great because they actually tell you what they're thinking. ... All the time.""  He's blind, and said his book about them would be called, <i>Roll Your Eyes At Me If You Want; I Can't See You Anyway</i>.

The reception capped off with a most terrible garter ceremony.  The adult man tried to demur sliding the thigh of the 14-year-old bouquet-catcher into the garter, but was commanded by the wedding deejay on the mic.  A foul kind.  Clap if you want it higher.

The next day we jumped off a cliff.  We were supposed to.  While swimming in a brownstone quarry.  It was a good swim, stroking through the warm sunny patches.  Everyone bobbed in a lifejacket and struggled with slippery inflated structures.  The slide was pretty good.  I got water in my nose.  Danny lost momentum and stopped sliding three feet before the plop.  Would do that one again though.

The cliffside looked ok, no problem, until my toes were at the edge and my eyes locked on the seaweed below.  I took the low rock but still.  A buoyant line-mate said ""just jump!"" and I listened.  The place my middle hit the water feels like Buffy kicked me across the room in that way she does.  It probably should only be attempted by 10-year-old boys to whom sticks no pain.  But I am proud, though I didn't do a very good job.  Admittedly, one is warned one will regret jumping from cliffs."

In fact, her play was pretty much <i>on</i> Theatre Alley.<br /><br />I'd learned from theater history classes that the neighborhood used to be the theater district of the city -- <i>all</i> ""districts"" were in the neighborhood, before the city grew -- but I'd never learned a street was named after it.  Park Row was specifically <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Theatre_(Manhattan,_New_York)"" rel=""nofollow"">the home of the Park Theatre</a> for 50 years, which was opened in 1798 and burned down in 1848.  I wondered if there would be any signs left that it was there.<br /><br />So I went to visit Theatre Alley, and I found out why it's barely on the map: it's not really a street at all (no signage or traffic), it's dark and full of rats and garbage, and is pretty much the creepiest place I've been in in NYC.  (Though, once I walked under the G.W. Bridge.  Don't do that.)<br /><br />Still I got pretty excited when I saw this sign, on the back of what's now the J&R Music and Computer World stores. Pictures on <a href=""http://www.forgotten-ny.com/Alleys/LOWER MANHATTAN/lower.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Forgotten NY</a> and <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nick-carr/the-death-of-theatre-alle_b_493028.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this Huffington post</a> fill out what the sign once said: VICTORIA THEATRE VAUDEVILLE CLASS PHOTO PLAYS.<br /><br />There are lots of <a href=""http://www.forgotten-ny.com/ADS/ADS HOME PAGE/adhome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">fading ""ghost signs""</a> in NYC, where ads were painted on buildings and left to weather forever. So seeing something like this didn't surprise me.  Unfortunately, the deciphered sign and those articles also reveal that it's a fake.  Perhaps as recent a fake as 2004.  Since there wasn't ever a Victoria Theatre.  Someone made a movie there.<br /><br />Disappointing, a little.  But still pretty great to dig into.  This is what the city is like, so often.  Old and full of fakes, ghosts, forgetting.  Places that were under your nose once, that you maybe shouldn't go back to.<br /><br />I've lived here a long time.</p>"

"event","I'm writing stuff before I don't remember it any more.  It's still spring for a few more hours.

In May we buried Chris's father.  It made my first trip to the small Iowa town where he was born.  Chris was picked up for the long drive early in the  morning, and I changed my mind a day later and followed.  A thing like this, it pulls your plug out of the wall.  It's hard to hide.  You should really just hop in the car when you have the chance.  Be a car-hopper.  But I flew out in a dress that's hung unworn in my closet for 10 years, which is slowly fading from black to red, as if it were in a Poe story.  I don't know why.

We stayed with his grandmother, sleeping in the former bedroom of one of his dad's 8 brothers and sisters, now a collection of Christmas dolls and Grandma's jigsaw puzzles.  I loved her.  I think she liked me, because once she made fun of me in the bathroom.  She shouted ""Who's in there?"" and I said ""I am!"" and she goes, ""<i>'I am!'</i>""  She likes mimicking.  You should hear her mew at the cat.  At the service, we sat next to each other and she was glad when I pet her hand.  

Before it, his aunt who looks so much like his mother brought him a photo album and a tiny green baby outfit he'd worn in one of the pictures, that she'd had with her.  And it was strange, because there's no call for it, the little overalls and ducks, in your grown-up life.  Except when your parents are both gone, I think it feels like evidence.  It did to me.  I was glad to see it and I kept it in my purse.

The following days were conducted mainly in the basement, with the boxes. And stories for everything.  Almost everything.  A few mysterious things we kept.  An antique microscope.  Part of the time involved the cyclical task of parceling things of his mom's, that his dad had kept.  We kept some of them too.  Other things needed to move on.  We sorted his dad's collection of sci-fi paperbacks book by book, mostly to remove the moldy ones, but also hoping we'd find we'd want something.  Douglas Adams, Anne McCaffrey.  All the decisions were made quickly.  One of the moldy ones I jumped up to rescue, like Fern with the piglet.  I brought it up to our bathroom and scrubbed the fuzz off of the tail with a decades-old toothbrush I found in the cabinet next to some Aqua Net.  We drove the rest of them an hour into town to a bookstore, and drove back on unlit highways through the sharpest thunderstorm I've ever seen.

Iowa is the right place to be unplugged in.  You don't miss anything.  In Iowa everyone owns cows.  They just do.  Their stories are things like, ""Well, I went into labor and I knew my husband was up at the neighbor's with the pigs...""  They'll point out whose corn fields are blossoming earliest. My most city person moment was the day I heard my phone vibrating, buzzing and buzzing, only it wasn't, but someone's was, only it wasn't because no one gets a signal in the house.  But it's clearly ringing!  Only... it's the cows, outside.  Now my phone moos and moos.

It was before dawn when we left for home, and Grandma came outside in a nightgown and crocs and we inspected the stars in the sky.  They're not what I remembered.  Soon the sun would be up and I'd be flying.  I read a book on the quiet plane and didn't think about my unread messages.  There were so many to come home to.  From everywhere.  But why.  I still haven't read them all.  I guess I don't need to.

Back to life, we're holding up.  My sister is here, in classes.  It's home, the three of us jammed in the subway door, leaning our way up Central Park West, to 168 where the M2 buses sleep.

On the first very hot day, I mingled at an event by myself, in the high 20's of an office tower, and when it was done I took advantage of the late sunset to sit on a stone in Central Park.  I ate an ice cream cone and read a book.  I ferried an ant out of my bra.  Some birds were making me laugh.  I talked to friends and heard a scary story.  I made phone calls into dusk, even though AT&T is trying to cut me off from the world these days.  Thank goodness I hate the phone.

But call me when summer starts."

"event","One day last week, after work I had to cross 34th Street.  I have to do this sometimes.  It's harder than it sounds.  I work four blocks away but sometimes the prospect of having to go to the bank, not just four blocks but <i>across 34th Street</i> from me, is too much to face.  I have recently changed banks to one that is only three blocks away.  <a href=""http://consumerist.com/2009/11/citibank-to-charge-fees-on-checking-accounts.html"" title=""BYE, CITIBANK"">That's not <i>why</i></a>, but it's true.  I feel much better now.

But I was near a southwest corner in the tidal wave of people, wondering how many lights it would take to get me across the street.  Crossing 34th Street is one of those things that reminds you of how some people think you are stupid to live in a city as crowded as ours.  Apartment brokers are another thing.  Noisy neighbors when you have out of town guests are another.  And anything about the MTA. Or ConEd.  Or the mayor.  It's an unfortunate list.  It gets you down.

This winter I heard a girl tell a story about being hit by a cab in a crosswalk, and that her first response was to sob, ""I JUST CAN'T DO ANYTHING <i>RIGHT</i> IN THIS <i>CITY!</i>""  It was the best short story I ever heard.  Go lie down, Hemingway.

So I'm grumpy on 34th Street.  We're waiting with a Don't Walk sign.  And then across a couple hundred people on the other side of the street, I see two gleaming tubas.  The tops of them, bobbing above the sightline, being carried by some people who I <i>can't</i> see.  Teenagers I think.  Ready to come towards me. Not playing, not marching, just there with us folks who are waiting to cross.  With their shiny, humongous horns.  I watched them and then we passed each other as if we all were normal, which is part of the code. I think you're normal if you think I am.

And I thought, this is one of those things that you can't explain to people when they ask you, What do you <i>like</i> about it there?  And you can't explain the funny, surreal qualities of your massive anonymity.  How you are a team of the anonymous.  But full of faces.

I thought I should try to remember it.  Even though I did not get out my camera, because for heaven's sake crossing the street is complicated enough sometimes.  I figure everyone can use some encouragement.  These are some more encouraging things I saw this week, and signs of what we're good for.

"event","Man, I AM SICK OF COMPLAINING.  

Instead, here are all the things that have made me feel much better.

<ul><li> A customary airing of the grievances, with Meg at Westway Diner, where the police officers watch over us. </li>
<li>  Passing my old apartment building, which has ad space sold on the side facing Ninth Avenue.  Right now: a giant, building-size photo <a href=""http://www.unitedagainstnucleariran.com/"">of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a>.  And I thought coming home every day to <i>Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium</i> was bad. </li>
<li>  Lyra's head-clonks.  When she wants you to pet her, she gets all freaking excited when you walk by, and looks right at you and flops onto her back so vigorously that <i>clonk</i> goes her little head on the floor.  It's pretty much my favorite. </li>
<li>  The surprisingly long list Chris and I came up with when I asked, ""What is that movie I can't remember where a guy is having a job interview, but there's something wrong with him and he can't control his arms and legs, and he starts wiggling like crazy and knocking things off the desk and it's all very bad for a business meeting?""  I thought something like this would be a specific enough situation to easily hone in on the suspect.  Still haven't figured the right one out though. </li>
<li> Corner brownies.  Brownie corners. </li></ul>
Feel free to contribute. We can create a center of gravity for uncrankiness on the internet."

"event","Yesterday at work was busy, and after work I ran some extra work errands.  Which was nice enough to do, really, because I went down to those fancy paper stores on 18th Street.  You know the ones.  It's a good block, particularly if you include a little time travel.  Academy Records with the 99-cent stacks by the door where I'd sit in hoodies and corduroys for years.  Books of Wonder.  Skyline Books where I stood once and read part of a Joseph Papp biography I've always regretted not buying.  

This month that store is closing, so I wanted to visit while I was down there.  I like these places very much.  The handwritten section labels on the blistered shelves are very good.  I like the cat litter underneath short fiction.  Under lit crit I found her sitting in a cardboard box, grumpy.  At the counter a bearded guy in a Modest Mouse t-shirt greeted the troops of New York in their loud voices, and talked about press coverage.

I wanted to buy a souvenir there, so I started looking for something old, because I think what I actually wanted a souvenir of is the first month I lived in New York, when I went to all the stores like this.   I had my first college syllabi and my first unlimited MetroCard, because I rented half a room in a dormitory run by nuns in Hell's Kitchen who never left the house, and I went to school on my own in Greenwich Village.  

So I decided I would do all my book shopping at used stores.  I went downstairs to the basement of the nun-house, where the group dining room was, and the vending machine, laundry and payphones, and I sat down in a plastic chair with a Yellow Pages.  I wrote down every secondhand books listing that sounded like it was someplace I could figure out how to get to.  Then I cross-referenced it with my chart of avenues to figure out what part of the island it was on.  Then I went to the subway.

I went east to Gotham Book Mart (departed), and downtown to Alabaster Bookshop.  I went to the Strand for the first time, and learned that you can't go to the Strand to look for things because you shall go mad.  I tried to go to Argosy Gallery but got scared.  I went up to Book Ark, and to Gryphon Bookshop, which was my favorite, and I stood on a ladder rung for an hour looking at their acting editions.  I went to too many stores to make it a really sensible method of sparing a few dollars on Shakespeare and Austen, but I knew the weird little exploration was mapping something new in my mind and I liked it.

In Skyline last night the first thing I picked up was an old <i>Adam Bede</i>, which rounds out my George Eliot collection.  This is a good thing to accomplish in a vanishing bookshop at the start of a new year, because last year reading <i>The Mill on the Floss</i> was about the best thing I did.

I managed a few other things too.  <a href=""http://corenrind.livejournal.com/2009/01/12/"">Even some I planned to</a>.  I was supposed to meet more dogs though.  Still needs work.

In 2010 I'm playing a closer game, I think, but here is a new list of some goals:

<ul><li> Meet more dogs. </li>
<li> Finish reading the books in my bookcase.  I like this goal.  2009 was a great year for reading.  I read 47 books, which I know because <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/elizabreath"">I am addicted</a> to giving them a precise and judicious number of GoodReads stars.  I will never run out of things to read, and I still have a lot of books I've owned a long time without reading.  Afterward, I am sweeping all of the disappointments off to sell at the Strand.  (I'm talking to you, Zadie Smith.) </li>
<li> Learn to purl.  Also, maybe do something interesting with Etsy. </li>
<li> Encollege people. </li>
<li> Listen to more music. </li>
<li> Do something good for my decade anniversary of living in NYC.  I'm not sure what that will be.  Haven't done very many things for 10 years before. </li></ul>
Easy to look forward to, though."

"event","This morning, I sat in the waiting room of the Women's Imaging Center, and I was uncomfortable because I really had to pee.  Instead I was patiently reading a George Eliot novel, the part where Romola is trying to leave home.  An older woman was next to me, waiting for a mammogram, and she said, ""Did you see the magazine rack?""  I leaned over and looked, and the magazine rack across the room was stuffed to burst with issues of Sports Illustrated.  She said, ""Kind of funny, isn't it?"" and I agreed that was funny.  Pretty funny actually.  I was really glad she said that because it had somehow made me feel a lot better.  Then our name was called, ""Miss Elizabeth"" something and we both got up and walked over before I realized it wasn't actually my name, it was her name, we have the same one.  Later I saw some wavy pictures of an isthmus in myself, and then I started my day."

"event","So lately every episode of Firefly makes me cry salty tears.  We're watching them again, and it is like what happens when you first watch Friday Night Lights, the television chemistry trigger that makes you choke.  ""Hormonal"" would be a funny word for it, if you talked to my doctor this morning.  Well, <i>a</i> doctor, whom I did not like, at all.  <i>My</i> doctor I do like.  A lot.  She says things like, ""I don't remember you!  But I'm usually pretty sharp!""

A doctor you don't like gapes open a vulnerable crest of apprehension in you.  When they're done you're defeated and crumply.  This guy mumbles and pronounces like a four-year-old, things like: ""birf control"".  Yes.  I cannot imagine I could have possibly hid my wince from that one.  Even from you, did you see it?  This wince made waves.  It launched rockets.  It makes you tetchy.  Yup, take five tubes of blood, twerp!  Five!  That all you've got?  

Because I've got more!  Lots, lots, lots and lots more."

"event","I had a nightmare in the old mode again this morning.  A few days ago I joked with a friend that I've had some doozies, but their time is past.  So that's a lesson.  Not a joke.  In this one I had a door to lock between us, and some friends.  I figured it would hold and I practiced my address in case I called for help.  Still, we just started out alone with our words.

I was woken up by the cat on my nightstand meowing over me.  I reached up and gave some scritches of thanks.  For most of the last year the cats have been kept out at night, because their playing as kittens was noisy.  They still gallop pretty hard, but they also like to settle into their nooks in the bedroom.  Dresser top, laundry basket, easy chair.  Getting up in the morning used to be like walking through a thicket of kitten limbs, but now it is just: oh good, lick lick, lick lick.  Hello."

"event","When you have a couple of bad days in a row, or, a couple of days with bad, stringy sections, there's a couple of things you can do.  One thing you can do is listen to the Lucksmiths, and another thing you can do is watch a 1970 animated musical of <i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i> on cable while you crochet a baby blanket.  True the baby is finished before her blanket is, and the movie is not a very strong adaptation*, but there's original songs for a hollow heart and I'm not complaining.  Some things just work.  

Another thing you can do is coerce my coworkers to order in another week of Thai food, because I think I have a pad see eil dependency problem.  It just is delivered so steaming warm, this precious torrid temperature, and the tofu is so gentle.  Especially when there's no sunshine, when there's rain, the hot noodles feel better than the world.  I need them.  It's a problem.

*(More movies I have watched during this blanket since <a href=""http://corenrind.livejournal.com/108034.html"">watching other movies</a>: <i>La Vie En Rose</i>, 2007, three stars; <i>Crazy Love</i>, 2007, four stars; <i>Casino Royale</i>, 2006, three stars; <i>All Over Me</i>, 1997, two stars; <i>Arranged</i>, 2007, two stars.)

Today I replaced my cell phone, which had ended its relationship with its battery.  Took the mobile out of the mobile phone concept rather.  If I had less respect for the internet I would tell you what I've been through with this purchase, but I won't.  It's an improvement, but I'm saving the right to gripe for dessert later.  This one slides open instead of opening in any sort of dignified way that wasn't invented in the last two years.  I like it but I'm dubious.  But as I said, improvements.  The old one didn't open or close at all, only ""locked"" its keys though occasionally for fun would ""unlock"" in my pocket, and try to text message the first A in my phone book with lots and lots more A's.  I even tried to thwart it by entering a fake person named Aaaaa, but it somehow knew.

I'm not ready to give up my alarm clock sound though.  Heaven bless that poor dead phone's alarm clock sound.  It is so lovely with these flutes.  Last year, Amy visited and one day mentioned that her alarm clock sound terrifies her.  And I laughed, because friends exaggerate, and then that morning I HEARD HER ALARM GO OFF, and wow, it IS TERRIFYING, god, the sound of it.  I could never.  The chirpy fanfare flute, that soft slant, that's who I am inside.  So I'm worried about my new morning with my new alarm.  I picked a jaunty little, I don't know, piano sort of, it's not the same.

Though I seem to be doing myself a favor in that regard, reconciling with my insomnia here.  We spent the summer apart, which was good for our friendship, and lately we've been seeing again how things go.  We grew so close in the winter and I don't think I can just forget.  I would wake up, 4:00, 5:00, 6:00, and we'd sit together for an hour and polish off a Lois Lowry book.  It was private and special.  My doctor prescribed something, though, and it ""worked"" for a while but I guess that is relative.

I'm not really upset, because the week will get better.  I bought a plane ticket; I'm arranging a picnic.  I crossed Prospect Park to and fro.  Emails are returning.  This evening I finally got one back from something that is blossoming, blossoming.  And I feel shy, but I can't look away."

I hope that this time, the bus does not break down on the Pennsylvania/Ohio border and drive backward out of the Appalachians to maroon at a truck stop at 3:00am, and fill the diner with 8th graders who all order toast from a single waitress, and at 6:00am Stefanie and Eric sneak over to make out in the dead bus, while the girls investigate the bathroom as a pack and Mr. Bach begins, slowly, to unravel."

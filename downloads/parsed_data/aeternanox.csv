"event","Isabelle loves it when I sing to her. I was singing in Spanish earlier today and she was all smiles.

I have a job interview on Wednesday. Woop woop! I need two jobs, though, so I'm still working on getting another interview somewhere else. Let's just hope I get the first job for now, right? Pat should be giving me some money when he gets paid Friday. Joy!

He and I are taking Alli fishing this weekend. That should be fun.

"event","I feel like posting here again. Not sure why. It's not like I haven't anyone to talk to -- I've been venturing out with friends quite a bit lately and I'm surely not shy. I just miss the silly internet nonsense, I think.

Alli and Isabelle are here at my mom's with me. Isabelle's drooling all over her teething toys. Yummy.

I'm trying to pick up a new job. It needs to happen soon so that I can schedule my classes around it more easily for when I go to SVSU this fall. I can't wait. I miss school. College can be so fun. I'm going to have a pretty full plate, though, between college, work and my girls. I suppose that people have had more to combat than that. Maybe I should think instead about being greatful for having the opportunities that I have. :)

I'm going to straighten out my credit and get the dents on my car fixed this fall with some of my extra loan money. Stupid neighbor crashing into me...didn't have insurance so there's not much I could do about it. I need to replace the front wheel bearing, get an oil change and get a tune up as soon as I'm bringing home a paycheck, too. Those things are becoming rather urgent.

I'm going to make Alli some pizza. Au revoir."

"event","there are certain people who have no business knowing about my life. what's more, i don't trust most people. so i'm removing this stuff from the eyes of others. at least until people can grow up and stop acting like psychos. i'll leave my account open so that i can comment and stuff. i have one last thing to do and i'll be out of here...

laura: i wouldn't put my unborn child in danger to fight you. also, pat didn't even know about most of the shit you'd wrote when he told you to stop it...he's even more pissed now that he's been better informed. he told me you were afraid, and you should be. you just don't say shit like that, especially when it's not true. it's an extremely stupid thing to do. if you hadn't meant it in the first place, you wouldn't have posted it in a journal that is viewable by the public. it's looking good for you that you made the entries private for the benefit of those involved, but a lot of people already saw them and you really fucked yourself this time. i still think you're a whore, a psycho, and overall a rotten person. it's funny that a lot of other people think that, too, and not based on anything that you've done against me. i could really give a fuck less about having to personally do something to you, because enough shit is going to come back on you without me doing anything at all. i was over it three months ago. anyway, i look at how miserable your life obviously is, and it seems as though some things have already come full circle. just keep in mind that whatever you do comes back on you. maybe that thought will guide you the next time you're about to do something really dumb."

"event","okay i never said that what i said was nice. but i said it because at the time you deserved it.

you have made me feel worse in the last few weeks then anyone has ever made me feel in my life. i haven't said a word about any of it either. i've just buried it all inside. i just hid it all. 

i feel like trying to fix things with you is wasted time because you don't want to fix everything you just want to yell and scream and tell me how it's all my fucking fault. well what the fuck do you fucking want from me?!?! because seriously i don't know!! 

do you want to see me break down and cry and say how i hate that naomi is ur new fucking best friend and how i just fucking lost one of the only people in my life that used to be there for me. but your not there now. ur never fucking there.. not lately.. 

i don't know what the hell you expect from me...

okay. i just don't.

i can't live up to anyone's expectations. i know this okay. i know! i know i'm just a big fuck up that can't make anyone happy. you have no idea how much fucking pain i have in me right now.

everything just hurts so fucking bad right now. it's all just slipping away and i can't catch a god damn thing.

let me tell you the only time in the day that i feel complete. the only time i am happy and i feel like maybe, just maybe i am worth it and i can make someone happy is when i'm with richard. he's honestly one of the only people that i wake up for every morning. i go to school and put forth effort and try to stay motivated so that i can see him. because he's the only person that makes me happy like that.

and to be honest danielle makes me happy too. and i don't care if you don't like her. because it doesn't matter what you think of her. you don't know her at all. and i don't care if you feel jealous of my friendship with her or if you don't like it. i dont' care. because at least at the end of the day when i call her up crying and tell her that everything is going wrong and i don't know what to do. she does out of her way to help me and to do anything and everything she can to make it better. 

you used to be there like that. i guess now ur just too busy.

so don't sit here and tell me its all my fault.. yes i've made my mistakes in all of this but you damn sure made yours too. and don't tell me that you wouldn't have said what i said tonight.. b/c the truth is you would say it, i feel positive you would. the only difference is you wouldn't have said it to me.. you would have said it to someone else. and i just am not like that. i say it to you. not to a messenger. i hate sneaky underhanded games. i don't play them. just like i don't get too close to people and make others uncomfortable.. .. oh well

i give up. i tried to say sorry to you. and you didn't want to hear it.. but you really owe me an appology too. b/c you fucked up too. only difference is i'm willing to admit i fucked up and you aren't. 

so if you want to be friends fine. we'll fix this and move on with it behind us.

if not... i need my sweat pants back i'll have your cd for you and i'd like you to just drop it at that.

the choice is yours. i don't care right now, because if i think about this anymore i'm gonna end up losing it and cutting myself and i know i'm stronger than that if i just try to be.

so w/e bye."

<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>I mean for starters why are girls the way they are. Guys always try to make it sound so easy and say things like why can't you ALL just be friends.. but really it's harder than that. Because with girls you have a ""best friend"" and you feel threatened by other girls. It's almost like a dating relationship but not, ya know? it's fucking ridiculous that's what it is.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>So I am not the type of person to hide things. I feel like my ""best friend"" is leaving me. I feel like she's found someone else who's just a better friend to her than I could be. And if that's how it is fine, I mean there's not much for me to do about it... it hurts though.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>It hurts because it's just more proof to me that I can't live up to the needs of anyone... I try but one way or another... and sooner or later.. I fail... oh well... =/</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>But it's funny that just as she begins to slip away from me and I feel like I've lost my ""best friend"" then Danielle comes back into my life. I love that girl so much! I've always loved her! I think it's because we both know that we are the same person with minor differences. We can relate to one another on a different level and we are more comfortable around each other than with anyone else. I absolutely love that.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>I just wish there was a way to be happy. . . </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>Losing my ""best friend"" does not make me at all happy.. I don't play well being second best for anyone. I won't even lie... I get bitter and jealous and mean. I do NOT enjoy being anyone's second best.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>Having one of my very dearest friends back in my life though does make me happy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>And having Richard makes me the happiest. Because I don't have to worry about this sort of shit with him. For him I have unconditional love. Love that does nothing but grow. I love him and through all of this he really is the most important thing to me.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>Don't get me wrong I love all of my friends and they are all important to me.. but no one is as important to me as he is. I just hope he gets to be there with me till the end... that would truly make my life complete.....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff size=2>oh well.. this night is just going blahhhh to me right now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2>Then Rich came and gotsted us and we went to his hizzy and you know what Finnigan and Shamus did????!!!!!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2>We got lost mucho mucho times trying to get to where we needed to be.. I solved the mystery but he doesn't want to admit to that! LOL! i don't blame him though!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2>Then we went back homeward and had pizza with su padre and watched that crazy scifi movie with ""The Children"" and their orange crazy eyes!! omg! freaky stuff!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc size=2>Then baby took-ED me home and we had some quality goodbye time complete with hugs and kisses and cuddles and it made me MUCHO MUCHO happy!!! </FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I really have to admit that lately I just love this feeling I've had like I'm letting everyone else down and I'm just falling behind and I'm not good enough.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I have tried to please so many people that right now I feel like I've failed terribly and I can't please a single one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I've been sitting here crying for 15 minutes straight now... I can't handle all of this pressure and stress. And the really fucked up part is almost all of it is being put on me by myself. I'm constantly trying to push myself to be everything everyone wants and needs me to be... But what am I really?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I don't even know.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I just feel so broken right now. Nothing I do is right. I can't fix anything. I'm just defective... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>And I love you so much. I do. I love you so much. And if it weren't for all that love I would probably do something really stupid right now.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>...sigh.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I don't know. I just don't know anything.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I'm such a ridiculous person. I really am. I don't know what causes people to care about me because the way I treat people sometimes... I don't even deserve it. I feel like I am undeserving of everyone in my life. I have these wonderful amazing people in my life and I really don't deserve any of it. Not any of it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I just feel like things are building up inside of me.. and it's not even any big things.. just all little tiny things that I never even noticed before. I want to be able to say what is wrong... but I DON'T EVEN KNOW! I don't know. I'm just sure that I feel things building. And ya know maybe after this 30 minutes of crying something inside me will click and I'll feel better. I really hope so. Because all I want right now is someone to hold me.. and tell me that everything is fine. Really everything is fine. School is fine. Home is fine. I'm fine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I don't know. I just need that right now.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I'm happy though.. really I am. If you take away all this stress and worry.. I'm happy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I'm getting a car friday.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>My Danielle, my dearest friend, my fellow marmoteer, she's living with padre again! I can see her all the time now! I miss her so very much and am very glad that we've made it through all the bad times and the rumors and we've come out of everything still loving each other. I care about her so very much! She understands everything and I never want to lose her.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I don't really know what else I have to say right now. I should probably go work on missing work so I don't fail school.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>no...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>I'm going to go finish crying and wash my face and put on a big fucking fake smile and go to work like I'm not stressed to hell right now and like I'm not worried that the rest of my existence is fucked. Because everything is fine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6633ff size=1>Everything IS fine.</FONT></P>"

I'm confused about the possibility of having to just give up and let go of my friend. I mean I just can't deal with this anymore really I can't.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=2>Then there is this whole school thing... gosh.. it's terrible really. That week I spent at home sick kind of dug me a hole that I haven't been able to get out of yet. I really need to focus on things. That's exactly what I need to do.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=2>I feel really bad for the way I treat people sometimes. Right now it is all branching off of another worry I have. I don't really want to talk about it. But gosh..... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=2>Everything will be okay. I just have to continue telling myself that. Everything is going to be just fine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=2>Other than that....</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff size=2>I'm in love with Richard. I have said this countless times before. But wow! He really just takes my breath away.

<P><FONT color=#3366ff>So yesterday was me and richard's two month anniversary! Our baseball game got post-poned which sucks.. but when we get to go to the rescheduled game we're gonna be 5 rows from the third baseline.. we are RIGHT there!! lol!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Today I didn't get to go to school b/c Adam sort of overslept and never came to get me... oh well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Oh well... </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>So I don't know what there really is to say anymore. I'm in love with Richard and things are good with us... Christina is the best friend I've ever had... again... lol! I'm not sure why we ever stopped talking but I'm glad she's all mine! lol!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Something I've come to realize lately though is that in life a lot of people you cared for you don't get to keep. Sometimes you have to let people go and accept the fact that you just can't keep them around forever. That's what I've been trying to do... I don't know though... people are just difficult.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>I don't know... I want to write.. that's what I want to do.. I mean really write. The kind of writing where I can pour out my soul and when I'm done feel more at peace than ever before. So I'm gonna go work on that.</FONT></P>

"event","Today is my baby's birthday!!

Soooooo.... Happy Birthday Richard!!! I love you!

so yesterday was St. Patty's day. I stayed home and slept and made the decision that i wanted to drop my honors english class and go into regular... but divis refuses to let me... grrr!

so for the past like 2 hours i've been trying to catch up on reading the great gatsby which i'm all caught up with now!! and wow it's actually a really good book! =)

i still have to do my 20 notecards and 4 sourcecards and make a thesis for the paper that'll be due on wed. i haven't started any of that...

i have this checking project for personal finance to do and 3 precalc worksheets... =( i've really been letting myself fall behind.... not good.


tomorrow i unfortunately have to open.. but at like 5 i get to go with richard to babysit alana at his sisters till like 1 in the morning and this girl is the cutest baby in the entire world so that should be a blast. lol

ummmm... i dunno.. i dunno what to say really.

i mean lately i've been overwhelmed. i've been stressed and lazy..

i need to use this weekend as time to catch myself up on everything.
then i need to focus.


i keep having this urge to do something that i haven't done in at least 5 months... i'm really hoping my good judgement gets the best of me and i don't do it... i'll be so disappointed in myself. =(

oh well.. i'm off to continue working and wait for my phone call from my baby when he gets off work! i love him! and i love my best friend too!!!!! =)"

it has however become a death cab for cutie night.. it's all i wanna listen to even though it's making me terribly sleepy and sad and nostalgic... :( 
i can't help it i love it anyways...

Death Cab for Cutie Lyrics

A Lack of Color

And when i see you
I really see you upside down
But my brain knows better
It picks you up and turns you around
Turns you around, turns you around

If you feel discouraged
That there's a lack of color here
Please don't worry lover
It's really bursting at the seems
Absorbing everything
The spectrum's a to z

This is fact not fiction
For the first time in years
And all the girls in every girlie magazine 
Can't make me feel any less alone
I'm reaching for the phone

To call at 7:03 and on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home
But i know it's too late 
I should have given you a reason to stay
Given you a reason to stay [x3]

This is fact not fiction
For the first time in years



We Looked Like Giants

God bless the daylight, the sugary smell of springtime
Remembering when you were mine
In a still suburban town

When every thursday i'd break those mountain passes
And you'd skip your early classes
And we'd learn how our bodies worked.

God damn the black night with all it's foul temptation
I become what i always hated
When i was with you then

We looked like giants in the back of my grey subcompact
Fumbling to make contact
As the others slept inside

And together there
In a shroud of frost, the mountain air
Began to pass from every pane of weathered glass
And i held you closer than anyone would ever get

Do you remember the JAMC?
And reading aloud from magazines
I don't know about you but i swear on my name they could smell it on me
I've never been too good with secrets.
No...

And together there
In a shroud of frost and mountain air
Began to pass through every pane of weathered glass
And i held you closer...




Tiny Vessels

This is the moment that you know
That you told you loved her but you don't.
You touch her skin and then you think
That she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.
Yeah, she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.

I spent two weeks in Silverlake
The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.
Yeah she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.

Wanted to believe in all the words that i was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that i was telling
And all the playful misspellings
And every bite i gave you left a mark

Tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did and so did i that day

All i see are dark grey clouds
In the distance moving closer with every hour
So when you ask ""was something wrong?""
That i think ""you're damn right there is but we can't talk about it now. 
No, we can't talk about it now.""

So one last touch and then you'll go
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more
But it was vile, and it was cheap
And you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me [x2]




Lightness

There's a tear in the fabric of your favorite dress
And i'm sneaking glances.
Looking for the patterns in static
They start to make sense the longer i'm at it.

Ivory lines lead
Oo wha-ho, oo wha-ho

Your heart is a river that flows from your chest
Through every organ
Your brain is the dam
And i am the fish who can't reach the cord.

Ivory lines lead
Oo wha-ho, oo wha-ho

Oh, instincts are misleading
You shouldn't think what you're feeling
They don't tell you what you know you should want.

Ivory lines lead
Oo wha-ho, oo wha-ho 
[x2]

Oh, instincts are misleading
You shouldn't think what you're feeling
They don't tell you want you know you should want.

Ivory lines lead
Oo wha-ho. 
[x2]




Transatlanticism

The atlantic was born today and i'll tell you how...
The clouds above opened up and let it out.

I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere 
When the water filled every hole.
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean, 
Making islands where no island should go.
Oh no.

Those people were overjoyed; they took to their boats.
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat. 
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flood lands to your door have been silenced forever more.
The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before
Oh no.

I need you so much closer [x8]

[instrumental break]

I need you so much closer [x4]
So come on, come on [x4]



kk.. well i'm off to bed now.. :("

i gave my mom half my check and she put it in a big envelope that says heather's savings on it and she's hiding it in the safe from me so that i can't get to it.. maybe now i will finally save money and accomplish something.. :) i hope so! i could really use a car.

my cell phone parts are here!!! well kinda.. the fedex guy came today but no one was home.. so they will be back tomorrow!

YAY! I MISS MY PHONE SOOOOOOOOO MUCH!

i've been ignoring my emotions all day.. 
people are how they are.. i can't change that. they will always be there to confuse me.. and i don't care.

oh well.

i surrender.



i'm giving in. i know i shouldn't. i know deep down i'll be disappointed in myself. but i'm surrendering anyways.

happiness i've come to realize doesn't last.
pain is always temporary but always returns.
people will always be there to break your heart... and occasionally heal it.


this has all just gotten too far away from my reach. there's not much of anything i can do about anything.
and even if i could i just don't think i have the energy anymore.


searching for something is pointless. you'll never find it when you need it most. it will only come to you when your completely unprepared for it.

i'm not sure where exactly i went wrong...
and i'm not sure what exactly is so wrong with me...

but i know that i give up on it all.

the searching
hoping
caring
feeling...


i'm done.



life goes on....

use me as a toy shall we say?

well according to our dear friend **** yeah that about sums it up.

but oh he didn't say any of that because god forbid he say anything that's going to cause people to get angry or upset.. he's only ""helping"" right...

fuck that.. fuck all this

if you wanted to fuck me u shoulda just said so..

i don't want to believe that that's the way it really is.. but hey.. who knows.. maybe..

whatever.

"event","So as of lately here's what's happened...

I decided that I needed to ask Jeff if he liked me or not. And he does but due to things like baseball and where we live and stuff he knows he'd never get to see me and doesn't want me to get hurt by that. I understand all this, I may not like it, but I do in fact understand. I was slightly hurt at first but as long as me and him can still continue to be friends and I can continue to get my bagillion hugs at work I'll be fine....

Moving on..

I had decided not to go to the dance then Ryan Cole offered to go with me and BooBoo would then go too. But I just don't even want to go to the dance anymore really... So me and BooBoo aren't gonna go, she is gonna come to my house after she gets off work tomorrow and shower and stuff and we'll get ready and find something to go out and do.

Which leads me to my next topic..

I love Christina! She is the best friend I could have ever asked for! I don't know why we ever lost each other after 7th grade but I'm SO glad we've found each other again! Everytime we are together everything is just a bundle of laughs! It's so great! Even when I almost kill us with my driving! haha! Which, wow, happens so much! lol! She's my BooBoo and I'm her BooBear and I love it! She's the best! AWww and today during study hall when people somehow stumbled onto the topic of cutting and people were talking about a certain someone who I'd rather not name that claims to cut herself all the time but lies and doesn't really, she just says she does for attention, then Kyle said he does but only in stupid drunken acts.. then there's me who simple stated... ""I used to but I don't anymore."" My BooBoo goes, ""That's cause you have me and you are never gonna do that again!"" And OMG aww that warmed my heart like WHOA! She doesn't even know how much it meant to me to hear her say that! I mean I haven't done that in a long time but for her to say that and really believe that she'll always be there for me so that I never return to doing things like that, means so much more to me than anyone can really understand..

okay... moving on now.

So I hung out with Kevin (Naomi's hott friend) and it was me, sarah, kevin and his friend dan... sorta wierd i mean we didn't have too much to talk about i mean not knowing each other and all.. but yeah it was alright. So he wants to hang out with me again sometime.. and I fucking left my favorite hoodie in his car dammit!!! GAR! I miss my Parknoll Panthers hoodie.. i need it back! ASAP!  So we'll be hanging out again soon I'm sure. 

But today Winkler was saying this guy doesn't stick with one girl too long which is good for me to know because I'm looking for a relationship... so yeah.. good to know good to know.

And my BooBoo always lookin out for me just may have found something great for the both of us!! I love her!!

Okay so let's see.. there's something else I wanna talk about but I can't here.. oh well..

Umm let's see what else...

OHH! why is it that when a guy is asked what they think of me their response is always ""oh she's hott!"" i mean seriously.. never ""oh nice personality, fun girl"" but ""oh she's hott..."" grrr! There's more to me then looks! 

At least I know if I wanted to get some I could.. haha.. but yeah I really wanna relationship.

Oh well.. there's more to say.. but I don't feel like saying it all tonight.. I'm off all day tomorrow!

I work 4-8 Sunday but told laura that if she needs anyone to come in to call me. I'm off Monday and might get to hang out with Jeff which would be cool b/c he's awesome!

Ummmm... I think Me BooBoo Will and Winkler may be seeing a movie Sunday night? idk for sure though.. Idk... me and BooBoo gunna go buy our new shoes monday! pay day! ohhhhh and our nails did!! gotta remind her of that!

OMG and guys... my cellys broken.. i didn't tell ya'll that!! AHH it's very hard for me to deal with this.. i've been having to use my dad's old cell and it's so ugly and not mine.. and :( i hate it.. i want my baby be fixed NOW!!! grrr! i hate cingular!! ARG! 

oh well peace out homies!"

So yeah had something great happen today then literally i walked right into something that brought me to tears... i just immediately went from being SO happy to being so confused and so angry and scared and vulnerable in just a few moments... i stressed so much i ended up feeling really sick got sent home early and came home puking... :(

i mean i'm glad i now know what i do.. but still i don't know.

i'm beginning to wonder if what i've thought lately is all wrong.. maybe people aren't what i thought.. i just hope that's not true.. i hope that everything works out.

it hurt so bad to cry today...

i've been strong and not cried for awhile now.. and then blah.. one thing just shows me that something means alot to me because one thing was enough to make me fall apart... 


i don't know...


please just don't play with me.. all of you out there.. just please be honest and just don't hurt me.. i have no hope anymore because people let me down so often and i just let them i tell them not to worry that i understand and it's no big deal but deep down i don't understand anything.. i don't get why it can never be me... it's just never me... what's so wrong with me?"

"event","So my mom was off work all day today. So I got to sleep in a little bit. So last night I was really out of it when I set my alarm clock and I couldn't remember what time I needed to set it for so I just picked 6:30 and went to sleep... 

Well I didn't finish getting ready fast enough... enough said. haha! I had to put on my make up in Astronomy. And yeah let me just say today was a complete waste of time! I had two substitutes in two classes. And then fucking we just didn't do nothing today.

Haha! It was so funny in Active Chem/Physics today! Hahaha! I don't know what was wrong with me but I was just laughing uncontrollably about nothing at all! Hah! Then Logan with his nice note on my notebook! Haha! ""Happy Valentine's Day Heather! I want to have your babies! I can feel Tickawanda kicking!!!"" HAHAHAH!! TICKAWANDA!! lol! That was soooo funny!

Then after that class in study hall Josh gave me the heart shaped thingy from his cool straw and his awesome ""Valentine's Day is for Losers"" pin! haha! James said it made me look like I just had a big black nipple! hahah! silly kids!

And tee hee damn Devin keeps lookin for that gas money I owe him.. he comes to me and goes ""Heather what about my money?"" and I go ""What?"" and he repeats himself.. and I just go ""What??"" hahah! then he gives up!

So yeah found out some nasty fucking shit about the nasty girls at my work. I've lost respect for both of them. hah! ewwww!

So me and Booboo might go out to see a movie tonight after I get off work.

Anyways... i don't know.

This day has been all right except for the ugly people with roses! Makes me wanna puke like WHHHOOOOA! BITCHES!! DIZZLE GONNA BUY ME ROSES SO FUCK YA'LL!!!! 

hahahah! wow... i feel like jumpin on someone and being like mmmmhhmmmmm baby yeah! lol! hmmm i got someone in mind toooooo! tee hee! wow.. these moods i get in!

"event","i'm about to do the best i can to get all that i'm feeling out.

and if some of u read this and know exactly what it's about then i don't care because i just need to get it out.

okay.

i like him. i like him a lot. and sometimes i feel sure he feels something back cuz i'm sure there's something there or else he wouldn't say some of the things he says. right? anyways. i don't know. other times i think he's just scared really. i think he's scared that maybe if something was to happen and we decided to try anything.. not that there's talk of giving anything a try, although i wouldn't be against it... i think that he thinks that it would end up like other past experiences he's had. i remember that he said girls are usually fine with things for a month then are like no.. but i don't know. i'm not one to be like that. i'm really not. if we were to have something together then that's both of us saying hey we wanna try this. and it would be an effort on both parts. no one sided half stepping ya know what i mean? if you want something like that you have to be willing to put effort into it. and i know that i wouldn't be one of those people who after a month is like no it's done this is shitty or whatever. i understand that he has things going for him and seriously i think that is absolutely great. i mean these are things that are going to really get him places in life and wow really i hope he never lets anything stand in the way of any of that. seriously i hope nothing stops him. and i know that girls can be fussy and be like ""blah blah blah you don't wanna spend time with me whine whine whine"" but i don't know.. i'm an understanding person.. and i know that having other obligations doesn't mean there is no desire to see a person it just simply means that there are other obligations at the moment and you gotta sit back and chill and go do other stuff till ya know the time is better and you can spend time when time is there to be spent. i just really think that maybe people look too much into their pasts sometimes and it prevents them from having some of the things that their future could hold. i mean yes it's important to learn from mistakes, but don't let mistakes hold you back. i just wish i better understood what was going on. i know how i feel and i know how i am and i know what i'm thinking.. but i know nothing from the other side of things. 

what i do know is when i talk to you i'm happy, when i see you i'm happy and when your around i just wanna be close to you. and i mean i can't explain why... there's just something about you that strikes me in a really good way. there's just something in you that i like a lot. i'm not asking for anything because i'm just not one to be like that.

i'm not looking for forever... just a chance to see what may come.
i'm not asking to be anyones everything or anyones life... i just want to be something to someone and a small part of someones life.. i don't know.. i'm not a difficult girl to please..

okay well.. i said what i had to.. 
and wow.. it's really nice to have that off my mind a little bit.. i mean it's still rolling around in there.. but not completely as much."

my mom called me off. today was her day off from the first shift job. so i slept for a total of 13 hours! that was really nice.
i woke up and she was still sleeping till like 2.

then i went and drove up to the school to pick up my BooBoo cuz i didn't want her walkin to work today it was damn cold outside.

came home ate pizza and then we left to work.

work sucked. that's all there is to it.

came home and talked to people.

found out that like everyone missed me at school today! it was really nice to know that people miss me when i'm gone. 

soooo idk.

tomorrow i gotta open at work, which would suck normally, but won't because i'll get to see jeff nice and early. that will be a nice thing to wake up to!

then after work i got time to nap if i want to and shower and stuff then at like 4:30 go get BooBoo from work and take her home so she can shower and get ready and then pick up my Tony Hill so that the three of us can go to southpark to look for a dress for me and so me and BooBoo can buy our Valentine's day presents for each other. Then the three of us are gonna go celebrate Valentine's day by going to see Hide and Seek! 

i would have loved to have a guy to be with for valentine's day but i love that i have BooBoo and Tony! they are just as great!

hmmmm then sunday i have to open but Jeff works then too! so i'll be off at 11... then i don't know if anyone wants to chill after that I'm available I guess.

hmmmm well.. i'm gonna go dream of that thing that i want that i don't have but i'd like to have and *sigh* yeah... maybe i'll have sooner or later... :(

So let's see....

There's prolly been some stuff that's been going on but I don't really remember it all... lol. uhhhh..

Well I hung out with Jeff a little on super bowl sunday! My team lost :( But it's okay because I got to hang out with Jeff and that made up for it all.

Uhmmm.. my bday was monday.. that was nice. idk.. nothing spectacular.. i loved the cupcake courtney brought for me though! tee hee

the past few days i've been busy workin and with friends and such.. i need sleep so bad though :( its shitty..

umm lets see.. friday i work till 8.. then i'm not sure whats goin on.. don't really have no plans...

sat. i open with jeff.. then after 2 me and tony are supposta go to the mall and look for a dress for me since the dance is soon... and tony's my favorite shopping pal! umm then later in the day after like 430 cuz that's when my booboo's off work me and her are gonna go shop for each others valentines day presents and then go celebrate valentines day together by going to see hide and seek that night! lol! gotta love my booboo!! :)

sun. i open but only have to work untill 11 and i once again get to work with jeff! that is very exciting! i like that boy alot... lol but oh well... lol

so yeah... i'm really starting to consider visiting this college in michigan.. me and tony were jokingly talkin about going there together and livin together up there while we do the whole college thang.. but i seriously am thinkin about it.. it's like 3 hours away.. i dunno.. maybe.. ? then again i get so many damn letters from colleges in the mail all the time i'm thinkin i could get into alot of places.. so it's all just gonna be up to me and the parents and really just a scholarship money issue.. yeah.. i dunno.. i can go anywhere really.. i mean for accounting it's pretty easy to major in that anywhere.

so yeah... lately i've just been feeling out of it.. like i'm going through the day and then i lay down at night and fall right to sleep i'm just soooo exhausted.. :(

i need sleep..

hmmm...

so i think i am feeling something for someone and sometimes i think i should maybe be like yeah and come out with it all but other times i'm like noooo it'll never happen and then i'm like oh but i mean it could? so i don't know i'm really confused.. anyone know what i should do?! lol i don't.

oh well.. i'm off to sleep or something...?

"event","i've been struggling to describe how i feel lately. i think this may be due to the fact that the past few days i've put on my happy face and left all the true emotions for my alone at home time. this is good because then i don't have to attempt to try to explain how i'm feeling or whats wrong to anyone (because usually no one really gets it) and its bad because then i start feeling conflicted inside.

but here it is.. all laid out as much as it can be.. as much as i'll allow it to be.....

i miss things. the way stuff was. the things that i used to have. back in the day everything in life was fun and simple. then people started drifting. things fell apart. i fell apart. that hurts.

other than that i miss you.

and other than that i miss feeling optimistic.. i haven't felt optimistic in 3 years. yeah that's pretty shitty stuff. i put myself down and tell myself it won't happen or i'm not good enough before i even give myself the chance to possibly succeed.

and now i'm all like yeah i feel this and i feel that and they are contradicting and i hope for this but i wish for that and i just want this and that and not to be like that anymore. i just want. and i need.

i don't know.

it's strange how the littlest things can affect you in the biggest way.

anyways.

i just know what i want and there's nothing i can do about it so i'm gonna just learn to deal.

i can't wait till march. i want to see all my bands. all these beautiful people and they're beautiful music that puts me at peace when i'm angry and cheers me up when i'm sad. all these songs that i can use to describe my emotions better than any words i could have come up with on my own.
god.. i love it i can't wait.

i miss writing. i used to write all the time. and i was good (not to be all full of myself but i mean i was). i miss it i can't seem to do it anymore.. i dunno..

blah.


i'm gonna go back to listening to hawthorne heights because they are fitting my mood best tonight.

"event","Yeah I don't know I've had some time to think and reflect and you know what...
everything IS okay.

Like after talking to people and stuff like I'm damn confident in the sense that I know if I want some, I can get some, because there are a lot of people that wanna get on me and I did NOT know this untill very recently. Haha!

So that is somewhat comforting... then again maybe I could do it better myself!! HAH! Yeah sorry that was a bit much.

So yeah the truth is though I'm really not that type.. to like go out looking for some ass just ain't how I am. If it happens it happens, but I ain't gonna go chasing it down. And yes it's a fact of life sooner or later everyone's horny. Sex happens.

But I'm really not looking to rush into anything at the moment. Which I find it funny that one day goes by of me being alone and I'm getting offers like hey wanna do something or hey I'll leave my girlfriend for you! hah! What a self esteem boost. But no, seriously. When I do decide to get involved with someone I want something real. No lies, no secret motives... I just wanna love someone (and not like serious serious love love) just like A LOT. And if I'm not feeling it then it won't happen, but if I am I'm gonna work at things and it'll all be good.

Me just want some happiness!

I am also really hoping to go back to being friends with Matt. Because he is a kick ass guy who is fun when he's not half asleep, tee hee! Yeah so hopefully that will work out.

HAHA! Funniest thing today was: Me and Tony walking to lunch holding hands and some girl going AWWW like she thought we were together or something! HAH! She obviously don't know that's my Will right there! hello! get with the program people!

So my Boo Boo was awfully not perky today. Don't know what was wrong with her but hopefully she cheers up.

Hmmm.... lemme think here.

Oh! I found out that there's a winter dance on the 19th and Tony thinks I should ask a certain someone to come with me.. and I don't know maybe I will.. it could be fun! Who know?!

Yeah so I'm really hoping me and Smegie can get some girlies together to go dancing this weekend because I really want to go outttt! And on Thurs. I talked Devin into driving me and Tony to the mall so I'ma buy some sexy sexy clothes in hopes of going out and having some fuuuuun! w00t w00t!

So yeah. I don't really know.

I had a few low points in my day... 

Such as Mr. Thompson asking me how I was holding up this morning when I went to visit him... his honest concern for my well being was really nice and I just about wanted to cry because he cared. Yeah I love Mr. T! he's the best!

Ummmm yeah me and Bee Bee's birfday... 6 more days!!! YAY! PLEASE SOMEONE ANYONE MAKE SURE YOU WISH ME A HAPPY BIRFDAY BECAUSE I DO NOT NEED TO FEEL UNLOVED!! IT HURTS ALOT!

ahhh and there's like 13 days till Valentine's Day... :( Anyone not busy and wanna do something with me?!?! I'm not seeming to have nothing planned and I've never had anyone on Valentine's Day before. :( 

oh well i'm gonna go now... peace!"

i understand why but it's one of those things you just can't really explain to others.

ever since the second i woke up today all i've wanted to do is go back to sleep. i just want to sleep all day.

school was irritating. it seemed like everywhere i went people were loud and stupid and annoying and it made me want to scream and rip my hair out.

i'm glad i work tonight. because i know if i were to sit here at home i would just end up being upset about stuff. and i just don't want to feel any of that.

all i really want to do is sleep.

but thanks to those of you who love me and try to make me smile. i love you guys. *you know who you are*

w/e i'm going to go fall into a short nap and hope to not wake up for a few hours.. even though i gotta work at 4.... :(

"event","my feelings on pain are like this...

physical pain you experience then it's over and you forget the exact intensity of it all. but emotional pain you carry. you carry it everywhere always in your heart. and sooner or later your heart is going to get so weighed down with pain that you won't be able to move anymore.
so..

give me the physical pain. that i can take. it comes it goes it scars it heals its done. instead of using your words or lack of them why can't you just punch me in the stomach for awhile. make me bleed a little. i can take that. but to sit there and verbally put me down night after night and make me feel so completely inadequate... that hurts me too much to even comprehend.

i just wish i could avoid the emotional pain and stick with the physical. i wish i was one of those people who didn't bury so many of their emotions. i wish i could be perfect for you. meet your every need. be exactly who you all want me to be. but i really just can't. and i'm not. i've spent so much time trying to make everyone else happy that most of the time i just forget about my own happiness. i wish i just had someone to talk to that understood everything that i'd like to talk about.

i need to call danielle soon. that would help i think.

i need to know how you feel. and i need to know what you want. and what you aren't telling me and what you need.... i need to know so much. and i don't.
i don't have control of anything.

i wish i did though....

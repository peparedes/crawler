"event","so i had therapy today with my old therapist, who is now my current therapist again. Yay. seriously, Yay. After therapy, I had a few hours to spend before i could go work on projects in the arts and journalism building, so I went for a drive along the white river, while the sun was setting. It was beautiful, orange and blue and red, it was amazing. So for some reason, i went out to where i used to work, just to drive by the house. Very melancoly. So i talked to myself, all about what i want to say to the teacher tomorrow. Still struggling with what to say, but from talking with t it is apparent i need to say something. *sigh* 

but i am feeling okay today... lots to do before the end of the week, but okay. I have been given a great gift, and I am not going to allow anything to stand in my way of becoming who i can be."

"event","so I hate all those Kirstie Alley commercials for Jenny Craig... possibly because she lost a bunch of weight while I continue to gain, but this latest commercial PISSES ME OFF. Dang it, just let her finish talking! The other people who lost weight just keep interupting her when she is trying to say something, and I want to know what she has to say! 

and to continue complaining... i'm watching Vh1's 100 Greatest Teen Stars... and I cant believe Ralph Macchio was in the 80s.... he is much better than the 80s, he should be around the 40s at least. Damn. I mean, Karate Kid! c'mon!"

Ginger, the chihuahua, likes to play and chase the kitten, but gets upset that Vincent plays with her toys. The Cats, well, Lucy is the only cat to inhabit the livingroom (where the kitten spends most of his time). She growls when he comes near, but she gets attention from me (she is on my lap right now). Maria and Phoebe are hiding in the bathroom, Maria hiding IN THE CABINETS. The kitten is that horrible to her, THE CABINETS. lol. The only thing I worry about the kitten is that Ginger is harrassing it too much. Ginger loves to play, and the kitten loves to play, so they are having a good time, but I think Vincent gets a little overwhelmed. He will sometimes just start crying, and I go look for him, and Ginger has him cornered somewhere, tapping her paws in front of him, trying to get him to play."

"event","a narrative of the past few day's events, with pictures
<lj-cut>
We went from Tampa down to Pine Island, stopping at a nice beach along the way...

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/prostheticfingr/pic/000638pa/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/prostheticfingr/pic/000638pa/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

I picked up shells and generally enjoyed myself. We didnt stay long, because we wanted to get to Aunt Gerrie's at a reasonable time. We visited with her for a whole day, eating dinner at Captain's Cove, a local seafood shack on the beach. I had the best damn fried clams I've ever had. I heard a lot of family gossip, painted a bit, and generally tried to pass the time without being a nuisance to my mom. yesterday we stopped at two manatee parks, and enjoyed them both very much. It is so peaceful to stand and watch them slowly moving in the water.

We stopped at a janky trucker motel 20 miles from orlando, cheapest hotel we had. We ate dinner at a bar attached to the motel, crappy pizza. I played pool and drank a Schmirnoff Ice, and had an okay time. 

Today we went to Seaworld. Mom didnt enjoy Seaworld as much as I did, she was spoiled by Busch Gardens. It was more crowded, and there wasnt a trolley system to get from one area to the other, so there was a lot of walking. mom was having trouble with her hips, and we had to stop frequently. I didnt mind, i just wish she would take a break before getting grouchy. 

We stopped at the stingray petting area and I took full advantage of petting them. They are slimy, and rough at the same time. They like to be pet, they will see your hand and swim up to it, and leisurly swim past. I had one that kept swimming back to me to get pet over and over. We then made our way to the dolphin pool, where I spent some cash and fed the dolphins.

I really enjoyed the dolphins, they know exactly how many fish you have, and will swim away when you run out. The trainer would signal some to come over if they notice you had been left out. 

We saw captive manatee, and got a closer look. These manatee had a lighter skin tone, and were much fatter than wild manatee. One had been seriously injured by a boat, she was missing half her tail and part of one flipper.

We then went to the dolphin show, which was extremely hoaky, but i have a few pics:

We ate lunch, then went to the Shamu Show. It was impressive!

The arctic adventure was okay, the polar bears were indoors and they looked so depressed. The walrus was feeling good, and I think he was actually pleasing himself in front of all the guests. He kept floating up and down and rubbing his, um, belly area. I now have a huge thing for beluga whales... absolutely love them
aaand of course i have some pictures:

We couldnt see the otters between shows, which was dissappointing. Mom was getting tired so I suggested we go back to the dolphin area where I could feed dolphins again and she could sit at the smoking area and rest. I spent another hour with the dolphins, loving every minute. I tried to take some pictures of myself with them and they failed, but a brittish lady was nearby and offered to take what has become my favorite picture of the whole trip. Then i made mom come down and take some more pics of me with the dolphins.

Well, the park was closing and I wanted one more picture to remember this awesome day.


<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/prostheticfingr/pic/0006t4x3/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/prostheticfingr/pic/0006t4x3/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

So now we are at the hotel. We ate at this awesome biker restaurant/bar, well, more for touristy bikers. I had the best shrimp ever, bigger than your thumb and tasty! We are only fooling ourselves when eating seafood in indiana. Tomorrow we are going to stop at the beach again so I can see the atlantic ocean before heading towards the smokies."

"event","Well today was just wonderful. We found Busch Gardens with little difficulty, got a great parking space and were there just as the park opened. The park wasnt busy, there were around 5000 people there and they said a busy day would have around 35000. This was great because the lines werent long, and there werent people crowding around you to look at things. The animal exhibits here are AMAZING. I'm gonna post pictures next, to keep them under a cut. I rode one coaster, but didnt brave Sheikra, with the 90 degree drop... im a chicken without friends around to egg me on to do stupid things. All I could think looking at it was about when we were at Cedar Point and Val kept saying ""what have we done"" or something like that as we were going up the hill on Mantis... You get so close to the animals, its unreal. My favorite were the tigers, as they were play fighting as we watched... see the pics. The food was great, they actually included healthy choices for people who dont want to eat junk. We saw the show ""Katonga"" which is a lion king on broadway rip off, but it was really well done and fun. The little kid next to me started crying because there is a part with lightning and it was a little intense. I took tons of photos, and it was hard to choose which ones to share. We ended the day riding the gondalas across the park, getting a birds eye view of the animals. We are going to drive down along the coast tomorrow towards Aunt Gerrie's house. I'll be offline for a few days, cuz i think we are staying with her. 

peace out y'all"

"event","Woohoo for day three! We are in Tampa Bay, staying in a comfort inn along 75. Tomorrow is Busch Gardens. Today we went to MOSI, the Museum of Science and Industry, on a whim. There was a sign on the interstate advertising ""Bodies the Exhibition"", which appeared to be an exhibit that I had seen on TV and wanted to see in person... unfortunately it wasnt exactly the same exhibit, but similar. I think the one I want to see is called ""Body Worlds""... So then we went over to the Salvador Dali Museum, which was awesome. Just amazing, i am really inspired to paint tonight... and i cant wait till i can afford oil paints. We stopped and ate dinner then went over to a Manatee park, but it was closed, then there was another park but it was closed as well. At 6pm! So here we are in the hotel room, sitting around. I am going to paint, then read the book i bought at a Dollar store in Tifton Georgia about an alien that is stranded in Midevil Europe... it sounds stupid but it is actually a fun read"

Email this Story

Nov 28, 11:54 AM (ET)

SAGUENAY, Quebec (AP) - A 15-year-old girl with a peanut allergy died after kissing her boyfriend, who had just eaten a peanut butter snack, hospital officials said Monday.

Christina Desforges died in a Quebec hospital Wednesday after doctors were unable to treat her allergic reaction to the kiss the previous weekend.

Desforges, who lived in Saguenay, about 155 miles north of Quebec City, was almost immediately given a shot of adrenaline, a standard tool for treating the anaphylactic shock brought on by a peanut allergy, officials said.

An autopsy was being performed. Dr. Nina Verreault, an allergist at the Chicoutimi Hospital in Saguenay, declined to comment on the case.

The symptoms of peanut allergy can include hives, plunging blood pressure and swelling of the face and throat, which can block breathing.

Peanut allergies have been rising in recent decades. The reason remains unclear but one study found that baby creams or lotions with peanut oil may cause children to develop allergies later in life.

About 1.5 million Americans are severely allergic to even the smallest trace of peanuts and peanut allergies account for 50 to 100 deaths in the United States each year. Canadian figures were not immediately available.

"event","im not sure what to think about today. i went to my mom's because the insurance adjuster was sposed to call, but he never did. the girls were there, the whole freakin time, screaming and yelling and manhandling ginger all day. then mom and i went to see a movie, which was pretty good (Elizabethtown), even better because we  have friends in E-town and the movie really hit the nail on the head. 

i'm afraid of going full-tilt nuts. I'm watching a movie right now, called My Sister's Keeper, on the Halmark channel. Kathy Bates is the crazy sister of some chick who works in an art gallery. I just... i see the Kathy Bates character as a future version of me. I just... i dont want to be a burden on my family, and I am headed down that road. i have these ideas for being a painter, but what if it's all just pipe dreams... what if my future is full of hospitalizations and medications and therapy and that;s it? The mother dies and Kathy says she just wanted her mom to be proud of her, and she thought she never was... i want a life my mother will be proud of, and living holed up in a trailer working shit jobs isnt it. urges are bad tonight, have been all day. just, just feeling very fragile and the girls were on my last nerve. 

kathy bate's character at one point says ""You know the meds are just covering up the real me"" or something like that... and it's so true. the real me, whoever that is, will never see the light of day so long as i medicate. but the alternative?"

on a good note, mom and i went shopping for art supplies, and i have discovered the joy of Arches 140 lb cold press... it is the shit, best paper ive ever used. i also got a presentation book to display my stuff... art shit is so expensive. i payed 9.60 per sheet of paper... then looked online and dick blick has it for less than 4.00, so i'll be ordering mine online from now on..."

"event","so a GREAT day today... I had my first morning at the frame shop/gallery, and i did a lot of housekeeping there, but it was fun. They are getting ready for a big show tomorrow, and a lot of little stuff had to be done like dusting all the frame samples and sweeping in the corners and the like. I'm gonna go back tomorrow after my appointment with voc rehab. I'm getting ready to go to my parents house and work/possibly ride Levi... i havent been on a horse in ages so I cant wait. 

therapy was alright, but I guess I just dont know what to work on now. I dont know what to talk about. blah. I just, I normally have a big switch up in therapists after an episode like this, so Im not sure how to work through this with the same one. I just dont want to waste anyone's time. blah blah blah

ginger is playing with a sponge... i gotta get it away from her before she tears it up, but she is so cute playing with it. *sigh*

i almost got another dog yesterday... i came home from therapy and this cute aussie pup came running to me. She was about half grown, and her chain was broken (she had about 4 inches of chain still attached to her collar. My neighbor recognized her as belonging down the street, so i took her home. she was beautiful. 

enough, off to Levi"

"event","k, so I'm sitting at home in Indiana, and the one thing i really want
to do is go down to the areas hit by Katrina, or the shelters in
various cities, and help out. I know, I wouldnt be much help to anyone
and just another mouth to feed, but I just wish there was more I could
do besides send money to the Red Cross. I cant believe people are just
dying in the streets, little babies going without food and water.
Grandma's dying and being left on the side of the road. I also cant
believe how callous some people are being, I was listening to the radio
and this guy was basically saying everyone who stayed asked for it and
deserved what they got. Well, tell me what you'd do if you were dirt
poor and didnt have a car or anywhere to go. If your job meant you
stayed at the hospital with patients. You're 90 and cant walk and your
family doesnt stay in touch. I'm not supporting the mass chaos, the
idiots out there with guns shooting at people trying to help, so far as
I am concerned lethal force if necessary to rid the area of assholes
doing that sort of thing. But how can you look at the mothers with
young children and not want to get them out of there? How can you not
want to get formula to those kids? And I just wonder what is going on
with the MR/DD population of the coast. Did the group homes and
ICF/MRDD facilities evacuate in time? Where have they gone and how long
can they stay there? What are we as a nation doing to get them help?
Does anyone care?
I just wish there was more I could do. I wish i had a truck i could
load up with supplies and just take off work and drive down. Aside from
not having a truck, the main thing keeping me here is the knowledge
that my job is short handed, and the work I do needs to be done. It
isnt something that can be abandoned for a few weeks to take care of
something else, *someone* needs to stay with my guys. So long as I work
for the company, that person is me. I wish I did something more
meaningful, I wish I could make a difference for more than three
people. I just want to help.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you can, donate.<br>

Dee Dee passed away tonight. I got a call from mom when I got home at
5pm, Dee had been sick the night before and I should come over. I drove
right over and Dee was standing in the rain, soaked, shaking
uncontrollably. She wouldnt let my mom catch her (last night the vet
had put a tube down her nose to give her fluids, and she was
understandably skittish about being handled). I slowly got close to
her, stepping away each time she did, letting her eventually come to
me. It was pitiful, she was shaking so hard, I knew it was bad. She
didnt want to walk to the barn, but I eventually got her inside and
covered her with a blanket till she was warm. She was still shaking,
but not so bad. Levi (mom's horse) was outside and he was just freaking
out with her gone. She stumbled and fell, hitting her head against the
wall/beam. She struggled but got back up, and I yelled for mom to call
the vet and get my brother out here. Rick came out and she fell again,
and he helped me get her up. She fell two or three more times after
that, bashing her body against the stall, knocking her head. Dad
finally came home and said it was colic, and to keep her moving. Well,
she couldnt even walk at that point, so we just tried to keep her on
her feet. It looked like she was having seizures when she fell. The vet
showed up and checked her over and gave her some pain medicine and a
tranquilizer. He listened to her heart and apparently her heartbeat was
slow and occasionally it would just stop for like 5 seconds at a time,
and that was when she would fall over. I asked him to go ahead and end
it, just because of the falling and thrashing and how hard it was on
her. When she was up she was just shaking and wild eyed. He said he
wanted to check something, but to let her lay down. Once she was down,
he asked if we wanted to take her to Purdue, but I didnt want to do
that. She was an old lady and in a lot of pain, and a two hour ride in
a trailer while passing out then trying to get up would just be too
much for her. Well, once the decision was made, we tried to get her
outside so she could be put down out there, for practical purposes of
getting her out of the barn. We couldnt even get her up for that, so
there wouldnt have been any way to take her to Purdue. I sat with her
awhile, holding her head in my lap and just let her know I loved her
and it was okay to go. The vet came in and did his thing, then I just
sat there and stroked her head till she was gone. I went out to tell my
mom, who was walking Levi to keep him calm. Before, while Dee was
falling and getting up and all that, Levi was rearing and bucking
outside, but right before I came out to tell mom Dee was gone, he just
stopped. I went up and just hugged him and cried, and he stood there
and let me love on him. When I went back inside, he started acting up
again. Horses know.&nbsp; I called Tracey, and she said Dee's heart
stopping was a rare complication with bad colic, or a bad GI infection.
Either way, her chances wouldnt have been good even with immediate
surgury. I made the only decision I could have made, considering. So
yeah, kind of a bad night all around. She was a good girl and will
be greatly missed by me, my family, and especially her main man Levi.<!-- End of Posted pictures -->"

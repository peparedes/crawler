i do too.

so i hit this car in the parking lot of gin's chinese restaurant yesterday.
i didn't even know i hit her until she came out screaming: ""you hit my car and you're going to drive off?! I HAVE A BABY IN THE CAR!""
as if that makes any difference.
anyway, i hardly saw the damage she was pointing at, but i figured, i did it, so i'll pay for it.
well, i gave her my info and figured she'll call me later on that night to negotiate.
i was on my way and as i was rolling out, she flags me down and tells me she has USAA on the phone.

my heart dropped.

WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU CALL THE INSURANCE COMPANY FOR A SCRATCH OF PAINT?!

who the hell knows.
she's an idiotic bitch. that's all i know.

i took the phone and frantically told them i didn't want to use the insurance. 
that i didn't want anything to do with them.
apparently, it was already claimed and there was nothing i can do about it.

fuck fuck fuck.

so i told my parents about the whole thing and, well, my life now officially sucks.
this is our third claim (though it's MY first) and so our insurance is going to sky-rocket...
OVER A SCRATCH. PAINT!!
i guess it's going to be like $600 more every six months or something.
gay.

my parents have taken away my car and i will now be commuting to school and work by VIA.
good old VIA.

oh, and not to mention i have to pay for insurance, even though i'm not using the car.
hopefully, my parents will realize they're being retarded and give me the goddamn car back.
as for now, i'm mad at the motherfucking bitch who called USAA like an idiot.

thank you."

I didn't see him board, but i could only imagine the suede cowboy hat.  I've been staring at this man in seat 33-D ever since i got here (nearly 10 hours ago).  Once, he looked slightly towards me as he pensively looked out the window.  I wish i could've captured the moment on film.  It was beauty in a rather startling form.  I wonder if he could feel me staring?

His hands shake. When he eats, his eyes widen with every chewing motion and goes back to its normal state and repeats with each chew.  He reminds me of war.  He looks like a rather heroic man...as if he's saved many lives, yet tells no one of his deeds.  He reads a novel: Golden Buddha...that reminds me of a question that's been lingering in my thoughts: Why is he going to Japan?  He flies solo."

going back to the airbase i unsuredly call my ""home town"" is always a journey, not just on the train, but in the time machine as well. this year, though, looks like it's turning out to be quite an unexpected reunion.
best friends of 3 years ('97-'00) and still keeping in touch, tonya, jacquelyn, and i have been the ultimate trio of 1/2 jap girls you'll ever have the honor of knowing. we all moved from japan the summer of 2000 and none of us have seen each other since...until now. all three of us landed in japan on june 10, 2004; all on different flights. unfortunately, jacquelyn is in okinawa, an island south of the japanese mainland and is not sure whether she will be able to come to the mainland in time for us to meet up. tonya and i, however, had our own little reunion yesterday.

"event","We all know that it is a sin for an Islamic male to see any woman 
other than his wife naked, and that he must COMMIT SUICIDE if he does.
So next Sunday at 4:00 PM Eastern time, all American women are asked 
to walk out of their house completely naked to help weed out any 
neighborhood terrorists.
Circling your block for one hour is recommended for this 
antiterrorist effort. All men are to position themselves in lawn chairs in front of their house to prove they are not terrorists, and to demonstrate that they think it's okay to see nude women other than their wife and to show support for all American women.
And since the Koran also does not approve of alcohol, a cold 
six-pack at your side is further proof of your antiterrorist sentiment.
The American Government appreciates your efforts to root out 
terrorists and applauds your participation in this anti terrorist activity.
 God bless America
 and
 GOD BLESS AMERICAN WOMEN!
IT IS YOUR PATRIOTIC DUTY TO PASS THIS ON"

 nov 2 -lots of people go vote,but little do they know their vote doenst count because the electoral college decides who really wins and not the popular vote.  around 11 pm abc and cbs declare kerry as the winner BUT fox declares bush as the winner and whatever they say is true because they are ""fair and balanced"". 
nov 3rd-lawsuits are immediately filed between the candidates. its a tie,,but kerry goes ahead and decalres himself the winner then calls all 100 of his lawyers and tells them to get ready to go to work. massive riots and violence break out all over the country because the average american is tired of morons running the country and people finally realize that they have no control over the leadership of their own goverment.

"event","been a while since i updated my lj.
my last amateur fight is tommorrow night in morgan city. well, i might fight next month but looks unlikely. but after january i'll get pay checks put into my hand after the fight instead of trophies. i'm finally proud of myself for once. i wish my dad were still alive to see it,, he would have never imagined that i'd ever become a professional boxer. he died (6 years ago next saturday) about 3 months after i started boxing so he never got to see me fight.i remember when i told him i had started boxing..his reaction was "" well say good bye to your nose"" and he kind of laughed.
tommorrow i'm fighting an opponent that is 4 weight classes heavier than what i normally fight at,,which is 130 pounds. i'll weigh about 140 and my opponent will weigh somewhere around 155.. should be interesting.i have a feeling it will be another short night for some reason though. we'll see."

Columbine Shooter's Parents Give First Interview

NEW YORK (May 16) - In their first interview since the Columbine High School massacre, the parents of one of the killers said they feel no need be forgiven and didn't realize their son was beyond hope until after he was dead.
   
   
""Dylan (Klebold) did not do this because of the way he was raised,"" Susan Klebold told columnist David Brooks in Saturday's editions of The New York Times. ""He did it in contradiction to the way he was raised.""

Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris killed 13 people on April 20, 1999, before taking their own lives.

The couple took issue with people who say they forgive them for what happened.

""I haven't done anything for which I need forgiveness,"" Susan Klebold said.

   
   
They acknowledged they missed signs that their son was in trouble. Klebold and Harris were in a juvenile diversion program for breaking into a van and stealing tools and other items in January 1998.

""He was hopeless. We didn't realize it until after the end,"" Tom Klebold said.

""I think he suffered horribly before he died,"" Susan Klebold said. ""For not seeing that, I will never forgive myself.""

The couple said they felt under siege after the shooting and never had a chance to grieve for their son.

Tom Klebold said they hope to understand someday why the shooting happened.

""We're not qualified to sort this out. People need to understand this could have happened to them,"" he said.

The Klebolds said their son was set off by the ""toxic culture"" of the school, where athletes were worshipped and bullying was tolerated.

Jefferson County Public Schools officials have consistently denied that bullying was tolerated or that athletes received special treatment.

The Klebolds' comments was criticized late Saturday by some of the victims' parents.

""I'm horrified,"" Dawn Anna, whose daughter Lauren Townsend was killed at Columbine, told The Associated Press. ""I wanted an apology. I wanted a contribution to help us understand why it happened, so that it would never happen again. I didn't hear it.""

Brian Rohrbough, father of victim Daniel Rohrbough, said he was outraged that the Klebolds likened the day of the shootings to a natural disaster in the interview with Brooks.

""This was murder,"" he said. ""In my opinion, what went on in their home led to Columbine.""

Brooks said the Klebolds agreed to the interview after an exchange of e-mails initiated by Tom Klebold, who was angered by Brooks' April 24 column. Brooks'column did not say when and where the interview took place.

In the April 24 column, Brooks had paraphrased an article in the online publication Slate that said Harris and Klebold yearned to become the most prolific mass murders in history.

The Klebolds' attorney, Gary Lozow, told The Denver Post the Klebolds had no plans to grant any other interviews.

In a story for Sunday's editions of The Post, Lozow related the first moments after the Klebolds learned of the shooting.

They had heard the gunmen may have been part of the Trench Coat Mafia, a loose group of students, including their son, who said athletes at Columbine bullied them.

""When early word came that the Trench Coat Mafia may be involved in the shooting, Tom ran downstairs to look for Dylan's trench coat, which he couldn't find,"" Lozow said.

""He was afraid Dylan might be involved. So he called me and offered to go to the school in hopes of negotiating with Dylan. It wasn't accepted.""

Harris' parents, Wayne and Kathy Harris, have never spoken to reporters.

After-hours phone calls to Times officials were not returned, and Brooks did not immediately respond to an e-mail request for comment."

http://www.2theadvocate.com/stories/050504/new_friends001.shtml#

Everything Sean Gillis needed was within reach of his computer: an ashtray for his Marlboro reds, a collection of Britney Spears CDs and DVDs, and oftentimes, his cat, Heather, which he named for TV star Heather Locklear.
The computer, set up at the far end of a small, dark kitchen in the house where Gillis lived for 26 years, was his favorite place to be. He spent at least 15 hours a day there and kept his activities secret. So far as anyone knows, he surfed the Internet, played games and downloaded photos of famous people.

His favorites were Spears, actress Christina Applegate and former Miss USA Ali Landry.

""It was his domain,"" said Gillis' live-in girlfriend of eight years, Terri Lemoine, 46. ""Everyone else knew not to touch it.""

That included Lemoine, her three children -- ages 27, 23 and 19 -- and the occasional house guest.

Authorities have the computer now, and are combing it for evidence to bolster their case that Gillis, 41, is a serial killer. He has been formally accused of killing five women during the last 10 years and confessed to three more.

In at least three of the cases in which authorities say Gillis is linked by DNA evidence, he is believed to have mutilated the bodies after death.

Looking back, people who know Gillis said there were few signs that he was capable of such things. Sure, he sometimes went out for long drives at night, but Lemoine reasoned that men just do that.

""He'd say he just had to get out of the house,"" she said. ""I didn't think anything of it.""

At the annual sheep slaughter for the Muslim holiday Eid-ul-Adha (Lemoine is a convert to Islam; Gillis is Catholic), Gillis was too squeamish to watch. He was never violent at home and rarely yelled. He smoked marijuana recreationally, Lemoine said, but never used hard drugs or drank heavily.

Several people who know Gillis, mostly family and friends who did not want their names published, offered a common refrain: ""The Sean we know could not have done these things.""

Bob Keppel, chief investigator in the Ted Bundy serial murders and a consultant on more than 50 other serial cases, said the disbelief is common.

""Usually when you hear things like that, it means they've found the killer,"" he said. ""They almost always have a mask to pull over for their friends, family and co-workers.""

He said killers need the mask for ""self-preservation"" -- and so they can kill again.

Helen Morrison, a psychiatrist who authored the recently released ""My Life Among the Serial Killers,"" said the public probably would be wrong to believe people close to Gillis should have known better.

""People don't understand the depths (of a killer),"" Morrison said. ""Most serial killers will tell you they have another person inside of them. That person is so phenomenally different than the role they play in the world.""

Neighbors and acquaintances have portrayed Gillis as an oddball, saying he has barked at the moon and screamed obscenities in his front yard about his mother.

Lemoine said Gillis was easy to perceive as different, but that she never saw the behavior neighbors referenced. He was a little weird, she said, but so was she. That was their connection.

""He didn't come across as weird to me, because I liked the same things he did,"" she said.

They are both avid Rush Limbaugh fans and love movies and television, particularly Star Trek (they even have the same favorite episode, the one that introduced the character of Khan, played by Ricardo Montalban). They never went to the movies or out to eat and never wanted to. Gillis would not talk to a stranger unless spoken to.

Gillis and Lemoine are both collectors who keep their collections meticulously ordered, especially trading cards. Lemoine likes Beatles and Star Wars cards; Gillis prefers sets for Charlie's Angels, Star Trek and the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders. The one set they both collected commemorated Desert Storm.

Gillis also collected Star Trek paraphernalia -- including an array of replica phasers -- and Bic pens with unique patterns.

He was able to dedicate extreme care to his hobbies because he didn't work. His last job, repairing copy machines for Xerox, paid $10 per hour, but he was laid off last September. His mother, Yvonne Gillis, who lives in Atlanta, has been sending money to help the household get by.

Without a job, Gillis would stay up all night at his computer, sleep for a few hours in the afternoon, then go back to the computer. He'd leave the computer for dinner, then return to it.

Since Lemoine and her children had moved into Gillis' Burgin Avenue home eight years ago, they had bonded as a family, she said. They celebrated birthdays and spent every Christmas and Thanksgiving together.

Her children ""feel so betrayed right now,"" Lemoine said. ""One of my daughters said she wants to be in that court to show him what he's done to her because he took the time to make her love him.""

That daughter refused to comment.

When detectives first contacted Gillis last Wednesday morning, he agreed to give an oral DNA sample. They returned in the afternoon to take him to the Sheriff's Office, where he was questioned.

He returned in the evening, ate the sausage, egg noodle and white gravy casserole that Lemoine had prepared for dinner and then joined her on the couch to watch TV. It was odd. Usually he went right to the computer after dinner.

When he called Lemoine the day after his arrest -- when he told her he had killed eight women -- he explained.

""He said he just wanted to have one last evening together,"" she said.

As calm as he was after giving the DNA sample that sent him to prison, Lemoine said, she believes Gillis was ready to be caught."

"event","What is Schizophrenia? 
 
The brain is a complex network of nerve cells. These nerve cells communicate with one other through electrical impulses and chemical signals. Chemicals in the brain, called neurotransmitters, help you receive accurate information, process the information (make sense of it), and make decisions based on the information you receive and process.

Schizophrenia can affect the way your brain receives information in several ways:

Your brain receives an overload of information. 
You become more sensitive to stimuli around you, such as lights, noises, and background information, and your brain has trouble sorting out what you hear and see. Often, messages get jumbled
Your brain receives information that may not be accurate. Because your brain is not receiving accurate information, your senses may play tricks on you, and you might hear, see, taste, touch, or smell things that others do not. This is known as a hallucination.
Your brain may store information incorrectly. As new information is received, your brain may store it with memories that are not related to it. This may cause you to respond with an inappropriate emotion, such as laughing at sad news."

"event","To Boddah: 
Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee. This note should be pretty easy to understand. 

All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community had proven to be very true. I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about these things. 

For example, when we're backstage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begin, it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can't fool you, any one of you. It simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100% fun. 

Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do, God, believe me I do, but it's not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. It must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms I once had as a child. 

On our last 3 tours, I've had a much better appreciation for all the people I've known personally, and as fans of our music, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There's good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man. Why don't you just enjoy it? I don't know! 

I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I've become. 

I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much, I guess. 

Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out than to fade away. 

Peace, love, empathy, 

Kurt Cobain 




Frances and Courtney, I'll be at your altar. 
Please keep going Courtney, for Frances. 
For her life, which will be so much happier without me. 

I love you, I love you!"

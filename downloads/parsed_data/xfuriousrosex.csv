"event","it's from the new weezer cd and it made me cry i was laughing so hard the first time i heard it. so fyi, i'm not saying it reminds me of you because you freak me out, just that it reminds me of you because it's something we'd say about someone--especially the last line because he's just so freaked out by the guy that he says he'll just be everyone's friend lol..plus it's just really funnyyyyy! plus it's set to this soft soothing happy-go-lucky music..you've just gotta hear it, i'll burn you a copy. ok here it is:

FREAK ME OUT-WEEZER

City streets at night
can be so intimidating
I'm not the toughest guy,
I gotta keep my eyes open
You came out of nowhere

Man, you really freak me out,
I'm so afraid of you,
And when I lose my cool,
I don't know what to do,
I know you don't mean no harm,
you're just doing your thing
But man, you really freak me out

""Did I hurt you?"" ""Are you okay?""
""Can I buy you a drink?""
""Oh, what's the world coming to?""
You came out of nowhere

I'm going to try to
improve my manners
Everyone, yes everyone,
is my friend.



ok so i hope i'm not the only one who thought that was freakin hilarious :P ly best friend jeff"

"event","so school's been going pretty well. in fact, molli and i were talking about it the other day and hate to say it but i actually ENJOY school! what the crap? who enjoys school, right? i seriously look forward to it, maybe that just shows how lonely and bored i am lol. except i'm skipping class today because i just didn't want to get up and then once i did i just didn't want to go at all because tjc is all the way on the other side of town and i'd probably have to get out of my pajamas so i didn't really feel like it. mom agreed lol-how cool is she? she actually even tried to get me to call in sick to work so we could go hang out.

yesterday i went to brookshires to get my year evaluation-got another raise, yay!-and then damon asked me to come back and help jeff and joseph reset the store tags. shut up, it was really fun. i mean granted they made fun of me THE WHOLE TIME but still, i got payed to basically do nothing for 4.5 hours..not too bad. And lets not talk about the sex parties jeff, i'm sorry i even brought it up. i thought you'd be mature enough to handle it but i guess not so nevermind. lol

well yesterday i met mom for lunch at casa ole and she said that wayne (my stepdad for those of you who don't know) got called to an emergency meeting at work (he works as the lead paramedic for a big medical air transportation company called phi) and he might have to go to new orleans for a week and help transport people from hospitals and to transport the dead. i'm really worried. i mean i know these people need help and i love new orleans, it's probably my favorite place in louisianna-even better than lafayette-but that's really dangerous, it's still flooding like crazy and the buildings they're gonna be in are falling apart. so i don't do this often, but i think it's ok for me to ask you to pray for him. i really am scared for him. 


*edit* wayne just got off the phone with his pilot and he is going for sure, he's leaving in about an hour.


well other than that, im' just gonna lay around and pretty much do nothing until 1:30 because then i have to go to work. have a good day!

"event","So the last of my friends have left for their destinations other than this sleepy town and i'm pretty much all alone. i mean i have a few people still here, of course, but the great majority of my friends are in waco or college station or austin or san marcos and it makes me really sad. today i was thinking about what i wanted to do this week and i was like 'i'll just call tina and we can have a whit-n-tina nite because we haven't had one in a really long time' and then i realized i couldn't because she's in college station now. that was the most pittiful thing i've done in a long time-i seriously cried, how girly am i? anyway, she's coming home next weekend for her grandpa's birthday so hopefully we'll get to spend some time together then.

school's going pretty well. i don't know many people in my classes, i've got jordan cooper in my speech class but we planned that so we're having a blast in there-i love that kid! and weaver and elliott are in my biology class and kim reeves is in my english and biology class so it's not so bad. i'm taking a lot of hours tho and it's killing me right now-i mean 17 hours is a lot for your freshman year-but at the rate im going i can get my degree at tjc by next fall and transfer this time next year so here's hoping. plus i'm working 35+ hours a week so i'm pretty exhausted but it'll all be worth it..

ok well that's about it, i'm tired and i've got a class at 8 tomorrow so i'm gonna finish my homework and get to bed

love you guys!

"event","so today pretty much sucked. it all started yesterday afternoon when i was sitting on the couch reading ""he's just not that into you""-fantastic book, i recommend it highly-and my cell starts ringing. and it's blake's ringtone. and i freak out. i thought he left last week for OU, and i was just fine being pissed at him for not caring enough to call me because i could be mad at him and i didn't have to say goodbye, that almost made me happy. but, of course as luck would have it, he was calling to tell me he was leaving the next day (today) at three and he wanted to see me before he left. damnit. so i met him a little before work and i realized how much i really really miss him. it sucked so much. gah! i swear-every damn time! so i was all depressed all day, i cried because i'm a big baby but i mean, i've just been in denial all this time, i really do still love him and the only thing i want is to get over that!! is that too much to ask? i mean seriously! i have no reason to still love him, i know how he treated me and how he acted when we weren't together and if everyone else hates him for that i should too, right? but for some stupid reason i cant. and how ironic is it that i was reading he's just not that into you when he called and the entire time i was like holy crap, thats me and blake..i know he loved me, at one point..but i just don't think it was as great as i always thought. but nonetheless, i miss him still and i'm a little depressed. why does this always happen to me? lol

what's been going on lately? well let's see. my parents have been in jamaica all week and i miss them like crazy! they're supposed to be back sometime tonite and i can't wait to see what they brought me lol. tina left last saturday for florida and they're not leaving until tomorrow morning. i'm definitely going thru tina-withdrawls. i don't know what im' gonna do when she leaves for school. i'm used to her living 3 minutes down the road and now she's gonna be 3 hours away. it's gonna suck when i can't just call her from her driveway and tell her to let me in because i need someone to talk to. it's really upsetting. and i've just been in this crappy mood all week. wednesday was scotts birthday which was really depressing. i bought him a dozen pink roses and took them to his wreck sight. emily went with me because tina wasn't here. i cried all day about everything. i'm an emotional wreck. no pun intended. and i talked to drew last nite and i officially feel like i deserve the title ""bitch of the month"" and it's only five days into august! i'm just not ready for anything at all with anyone. i thought it'd be ok but i was wrong. i don't think people understand how hurt i was a couple of months ago and i'm just not ready to put myself in the position to go thru it again. but nonetheless, i feel like shit about it.

today emily and i went shopping and i think i'm in love. with shoes tho because they can't break my heart and i can't screw their lives up. i've come to the conclusion that aldo will probably get every one of my paychecks for the next two months. i'm heartsick for a new pair. i even had a dream about shoes the other nite...i think it's time i adopted a new pair into my family. i read a few more chapters in my book last nite. it's absolutely hilarious! but i mean honestly, why wouldn't i love a book called the devil wears prada? and i'm officially a dietcoke-aholic again. i have this problem with drinking away my troubles..it's sad actually. 

josh called me the other day and we decided to make ammends. just as friends tho. we've been best friends for 6 years and that's so much stronger than what drew us apart so we made a pact to call eachother at least once a day and so far it's been great. i really missed talking to him about everything. he sold his corvette and got an avalanche because it's just more practical and he likes it so much more. and last nite he was telling me he's thinking about getting a puppy and you'll never guess what kind..only my favorite-bassett hound! im' so excited! he said i could visit it every day and that when he leaves next summer for his 5 month season i can even keep the dog! seriously, you don't even realize how much i love bassett hounds, it's unhealthy lol. and i think i'm going to tennessee sometime in september. he said he'd fly me up the last couple of days of the season and put me up in a hotel so i can meet everyone and that way since he has to drive his truck back, he won't have to drive alone. plus i'm pretty sure i've talked to just about all of the guys on the phone by now and i can't wait to meet them and he said they wanna meet me too, and the few that i havent talked to think i'm made up so we have to prove them wrong lol.

so i guess i better finish this and start cleaning the house up since mom and wayne should be home in the next 8 hours. and nick sydnor is supposed to drop by after work to refill the fridge since they drank all of our beer the other nite lol. have a good day.

love

"event","so today i had a me day...first i went to import designs and bought the necklace and bag i've wanted for a while, then i went to starbucks to start my day off right with a venti chai latte and went to nails by lee to get my nails done because i've needed to for a really long time. then emily and i went to regis and i cut ALL of my hair off..i hadn't planned on it being so short but i'm getting used to it-like jeff said, it's just wayyy different. then i went to wet seal and bought three new jackets just because i'm obsessed with them lol and then i went to katie's jewelry to get some new hair accessories because i don't have any cute clips to put in my hair. and then i went to best buy to show tina my hair and to the south broadway er to show mom because she was at work and then we stopped at brookshires on the way home for milk where i saw ms. sloan and ms. roberts so we talked for a while because ms. sloan and i are gossip buddies--is that sad? anyway, vinny and wes got indicted for the graffiti and looks like they're going to huntsville..i hate it because yeah, it was a stupid senior prank and they shouldn't have done it, but we were all pissed because they wouldn't let us do anything for scottie so they spray painted his number on the school..they could've found a better way to remember him, yes, but still..jail time? wow, that's kinda harsh. i guess i just have a soft spot for them because they're both so good to me and they really are great guys, but i'll admit, they've made their fair share of bad choices. i just hope things work out and they at least make it out ok.

so now i guess i'm gonna go do the dishes and get to bed because i have to go to tjc tomorrow before work to sign up for orientation..just like me to wait until the last day, huh? lol

"event","So it's been a while since i posted..been pretty busy, i think last nite was the first day i haven't gone out all week.

Went to the river with the fam weekend before last, and i introduced them to the beauty that is the town of gruene. went to the wonderful gruene hall, and ate at gristmill. then we went to san marcos and toured the campus, i definitely wanna live there. no doubt that that country is where i need to be, it's absolutely breathtaking! and on our way home we went thru luckenbach because i think it's a cool place but no one else did lol..then i worked the rest of the week and this week tina and i seriously went out every day

thursday we had a dinner date at casa ole and went to see bewitched which was so cute and then friday tina came over after work and we had a girls nite in w/ mom and emily and ordered double dave's and watched hitch and then saturday i took drew out for his birthday dinner and we had cheddar's and sunday tina and i went to jason's deli-that's right, i'm so over him that i'm fully confident enought to dress really cute with my best friend and eat in at the place he works..too bad he was off, i wanted to rub it in lol..and then we went shopping for a patriotic shirt for tina to wear to work but everything was closed so we had to go to walmart where we got hit on by nasty white trash..and then we went to blake melton's house because randy guilted us into it and all they were doing was playing stupid halo-sorry best friend, i just don't see the appeal in all of it, it looks pretty dumb to me..but maybe it's just because i have an untrained eye, i'm sure it's everything you claim it to be-so we left and went home and watched sister act 2 and then tuesday was the fourth and we went to drew's lake house with everyone, it was really fun..until shane thought it'd be funny to throw a wad of blackcats under my chair and i swear i have a welp on my ass and tina has one on her leg and then i got hit by at least 3 roman candles..pardon me, but last i checked, guys are allowed to have firecracker wars but they're not supposed to target girls! so then tina and i left and went back to her house and fell asleep because we're big babies. and then wednesday me, tina, and elle had a date and it was the most fun i've had in forever! we all met at chili's but tina and i forgot to tell elle that we were wearing tshirts and jeans so elle showed up looking absolutely adorable so we gave her a hard time all nite and then tina and i played chubby bunny with french fries which was hilarious..do you know how hard it is to talk to a waiter with 15 fries in your mouth? lol and then we all went back to my house to watch hide and seek and on the way home tina and i played our infamous game, the turret's game! and listened to the mexican radio station with the windows down, that was funny..but when we got back home we had hitch instead of hide and seek because the stupid girl mixed them up so we watched vh1 and had a marshmallow eating contest instead. and then last nite i went to my little brothers' baseball playoffs and we won! go bullard aggies!! lol

so now i have to go to stupid physical therapy because, oh yeah, i screwed my knee up again and i'm confined to a knee brace and therapy 3 times a week so hopefully i won't have to have surgery again. and then i have to go tanning and then to work. i hate my job..but it's ok because all i have to do tomorrow is serve cake to customers all day and say 'thank you for shopping with brookshire's' and i get to leave after 4 hours so i'm off by 4--i love being damon's ""lovely assistant"", as he puts it.

love you! whit"

"event","So yesterday me, tina, derek, and jordan v went to the lake house on lake cherokee. oh gosh..did we have a blast or what? the guys followed us up there, it's about an hour trip, so when we finally got to lake cherokee they called and were complaining and whinning saying 'are we there yet' so tina and i thought it'd be funny to pretend we were lost. we got to the road where the house is and it's a dead end street, so knowing it was the first house on the right, we kept going until we hit the dead end and then sat there looking around for a few minutes..called derek, told him we might be lost..they got pissed and then we turned around and drove into the driveway that says WILSON really big on the gate..yeah derek and jordan are real smart..so we get there and the key doesn't work so tina and i drive into lake port to meet her dad who has an original key, so an hour later we get back and get ready to play in the water. the jet ski has two keys, a regular key and a beginner key. the beginner key only lets you accelerate to about 35 mph. tina and i gave the guys the beginner key letting them believe they had the regular one. she and i layed out in the lake on rafts eating pints of icecream and listening to the stereo for about an hour and started to wonder where the guys were, forgetting we had given them the wrong key. they got back and started complaining about how slow it was and that they saw a boat full of cute girls and wanted to say hi but they couldn't catch up to it lol so we told them about the key and they were pissed. then derek threw me off the jet ski, twice! but the second time i took him with me damnit. then jordan drove the boat and i tubed behind it and i wiped out so freakin hard, i swear i thought i was dead. and then we decided to head into longview for some pizza king, but we got lost so derek called his dad for directions. we found magrill street and tina and i took pics of it and our new saying is Get off MAGRILL bitch! then on the way home the guys thought they were good enough to lead so they sped off but they got lost in overton so they called us and we had to meet them at brookshires because tina and whit always save the day. so they were following us and kept caling us saying we were going too slow and that we needed to set the cruise on 75 so tina and i decided to go 5 under the speed limit the whole time..plus play break check every now and then..and then we stopped about 40 yards short from every stop sign and let everyone else go before us, even if we were there first. then when they tried to pass us we swerved over so they couldn't...needless to say they were pissed when we got back. it might've taken us 2 hours to get home but it was well worth it. OH! and when we were on the interstate, tina and i were blasting some lynyrd skynyrd and had the windows down, doing our skynyrd dance and these guys beside us kept taking pictures of us! lol

and i can't go to warped w/ best friend this weekend because i'm going to san antonio and to the river w/ the fam. i'm excited because i absolutely LOVE san marcos and the guadalupe, but i wish i could go to warped. but i'm bringing jeffiepoo and tina shot glasses back and it'll be a blast. 

so i guess i'm out for now, drewbies championship indoor game is tomorrow nite so i'm gonna go wear the kick ass tshirt i made for him and support him.

have a good one, its nap time for me

"event","My parents are hosting the monthly poker party so i'm sitting in the office pretending to be busy when i'm really just listening to gwen stefani and playing solitare. lol

thursday was kinda weird. ashley and i met in town to run some errands and we went to lunch w/ jake because he's leaving for the marines and i'm gonna miss my buddy!! and then we went to premier to get our memberships but they said we have to get some other info for the discount so we said screw it, we'll work out later lol. so then i went home and took a nap and then dad picked me up for dinner. well i wanted applebee's but broadway was a wreck because they're repaving it so he goes 'lets just go to jason's deli.' well hell, i couldn't say no because that's what he wanted so i hold my breath the entire time we're pulling into the parking lot and to my advantage, blake was off..which doesn't happen often so i'm thinking i'm pretty lucky. so dinner goes good and then ashley and i meet to go to the indoor game and lo and behold, guess who's there. none other than blake. so since i've been to pretty much every soccer game, indoor and season, everyone knows me, and as ashley and i are walking in, everyone says 'hey whitney' including the parents..well everyone but blake, who pretends he doesn't even know i'm there. and then i find the spots katie saved for me and who's sitting next to her? megan vrba..who doesn't get along w/ ashley because megan dated shea after ashley did..so needless to say, you could've cut the tension w/ a knife in there. eventually blake got up and went down to sit w/ the guys and as we were walking out and saying bye to drew, he ran smack into me..i mean can we say awkward? lol so ashley and i went to nick and robert's apartment and had a little party to drink away the night except ashley got sick so she went to bed so i was stuck being the only girl other than robert's girlfriend kallie but we had fun..

so i got my phone today, i like it..i put a picture of green stilettos as my background :P Stewart's friend, scott called me today and i guess we're going out tuesday, who knows, and tina and i are going out some day this week..i think monday? 

so josh left today. he wasn't supposed to be at the airport until 4 but he called me today and left a message all upset because the flight got moved up and he was gonna leave at 2:30 and he thought i didn't get off until later so i called him and he was relived..he said he wasn't gonna leave without getting to say goodbye first. so he was running late because he had to get some things finalized with his new car and i met him in town because we only had like seriously 10 minutes to say our farewells until september. so im sitting in his BRAND NEW CORVETTE and he leans over and kisses me. well..i mean crap what do i do? but it turns out he and hillary are breaking up and i told him that i wouldn't promise him i'd wait for him or anything but i do care about him so when he gets back, if i'm not already in a relationship or something like it, then we'd try it again. i dont' know what it is about us, but no matter what, every time we spend any time together we get back together..he still thinks we're getting married and i mean shit, he's a freakin pro-ball player now! well...semi-pro but whatever it still counts lmao. but until then, i'm still going out with whoever i want and i can't feel guilty about it because i told him what was up..good for me i guess. anyway he said he'd call when he gets to tennessee. i'm not gonna lie, i'm gonna miss him a whole lot, i talk to him every day, it's gonna be weird.

alrite i guess that's pretty much it, gotta work tomorrow morning but i think kristen wants to switch shifts so i don't have to be there at 7 like i usually do but i also don't get off at 2 which sucks. oh well, damned if you do, damned if you don't i guess.
nite

"event","Today was a really good day, perfect way to start off the summer..for some reason i've felt really care-free all week, kinda nice for a change. let's see, thursday we all went to cheddars and double daves and then to drew's soccer game, that was really fun, it's nice hanging out w/ different ppl for a change. and then friday josh called me out of the blue and asked me to go to the club w/ him and his friend robert but i had to work so i couldn't-which surprises me because he's still w/ hillary and we had a long talk about how nothing between us will work because we've tried it too many times and plus the fact that he's either going to ut in the fall or getting drafted, probably to a minor league team in either tennessee or florida, not happening, and also the fact that i'm still getting over blake but ya know what i figured out, it's a lot easier to forget someone when you don't see them everyday and it's especially easier when they're out of the country lol..but they get back from cancun monday so i'll probably hear from them and i'll miss him, but only a little because i'm a big girl and big girls don't cry :P

::EDIT::
So i figured out why josh called, today he called again and he wants me to meet this friend, robert. apparently he's new in town, just moved from kilgore to play baseball for uttyler in the fall and he wants him to meet a few people. so of course i got a little offended that he was kinda pushing this guy on me but then he said he wasn't trying to hook anything up between us but that he just wanted me to try to find one of my friends for him and then robert confirmed this when he imed me today-because josh gave him  my sn i guess-and he said that josh talks about me all the time and is a little posessive of me..stupid boy, but anyway, that's that. josh still thinks we're getting together eventually but for now he wants me to become friends with this guy and set him up w/ my friends. i mean is it me or am i getting used a little? lol
::END EDIT::

so anyway, last nite we had our monthly mother-daughter night out and me, mom, and em went to dillards to find mom a dress for wayne's 20 year reunion, which she's really nervous about but she shouldn't be because she looks great for her age, and then we went to dinner and then went to the movies-sorry best friend, i cheated and saw madagascar..but it's so funny that i'd go w/ you and bryan to see it again!

and then today i opened w/ nick and ashley which was fun b/c they're two of my favorite people, and then when i got home i showered and changed and took emily to the mall w/ me because i've been having shopping withdrawls. i don't think you understand exactly how happy shopping makes me. i was in an ok mood before but since i've gotten home i've been in a great mood because i found a great top, the perfect jeans, 2 MORE pairs of sunglasses, and fabulous earrings and i got them all for just $150..i'm amazing! by the way, have i ever told you how perfect abercrombie jeans fit? absoluetly fantastic! i love them, which is probably why i've got like 8 pairs lol. and i got a new tanning membership because i'm so white that i'm practically clear, and then em and i went to starbucks because i was craving a chai latte and the way home was great because there's nothing better than the smell of warm latte and new clothes. so  now i'm watching the fast and the furious because i have a major crush on paul walker and hiding the evidence of starbucks from mom because it's against my diet lol

that's pretty much it, ttyl

"event","i freakin raped state! got my second 1st division at state on a solo, i'm pretty pumped. 

graduation went well..we went to jordan reid's party around 530 on saturday, then went to derek's to watch the guys shave their heads in support of jordan joining the corp, and then went to the graduation lock-in unil 6..it was absolutely a blast, lots of friends and fun and games. blake and i talked a little, he came over and sat with me for a while and we just kinda hung out, i'm not sure if it was just because he wanted to talk or if it was his way of showing a little possession so no one else got any ideas, but i dont' really care, i miss him. josh and i also talked a little..and you know how we are-i told him i wasn't ready for anything and that i needed time to get over blake so i dunno what the deal is, we'll see i guess. and donna said she'd talk my mom into letting me go to destin w/ jordan and tina and matt and everyone so that'll be fun..me, molli, and britt are still going sometime this summer to stay at britt's beach house on crystal beach for a weekend, cant' wait for that! and someone stole my phone and called just about everyone in my phonebook..which pisses me off because half of the ppl in it i'm not gonna see in a long time since we've graduated, but i should be able to get most of the numbers back and dad got me a new phone for graduation so i should get it some time this week.

and then sunday we left for austin at 12:30 and got there about 7...britt and i had a stalker!! we all went to carraba's for dinner and as we were walking in, brittany and i were seperated a little from the group b/c, well, quite frankly, we didn't want to be seen w/ a bunch of obnoxious kids, and this guy in a mercedes drove by, well we kinda said something about what a nice car it was and didn't think anything about it, then he drove by again, and we thought he just made a wrong turn or something, but then he drove by a third time. so britt turned to me and said wow, he really wants us to know he drives a mercedes, huh? we laughed it off thinking he was just showing off and we all went in and had a fabulous dinner bc carrabas is the best freakin italian food ever! and when we were walking out, the guy was sitting at the bar, no biggie, right? so we all went outside to wait for the bus to come pick us up bc it was raining and we realized the windows were down so everyone got on but britt and i decided to wait for mrs. mcmichael to get everyone else out of the restaurant before we got on b/c we didn't want to sit on a wet bus until we had to. so me and britt are outside under the pavillion and the guy comes outside and pulls his car up and gets out, apparently he's waiting on someone, and he sees the bus says whitehouse and he asks us about the town and what we're in town for and he seemed really interested in the choir. so we talked a little about the choir, didn't mention anything about our hotel or even our names, never introduced ourselves and we didn't even say by before we left. but britt calls me whitney dawn and i call her brittany hughes all the time and i guess he caught onto that because later when we were in our pajamas playing cards on our bed, our hotel phone rang and i answered it thinking it was mrs.mcmichael..it was a guy and he goes ""hey is this whitney?"" and i just assumed it was one of the guys playing a prank on us so i said yes and he goes ""is brittany there?"" and i asked who was speaking and he said ""Vincent"" so i handed the phone to her bc we still thought it was a joke but it was the guy from the restaurant! he followed us back to the hotel, asked the lady at the front desk to transfer his call to brittany hughes from whitehouse and ended up getting ahold of our room. the scary part is that we only talked to him for no more than 5 minutes and he still could tell the difference between me and brittany..we don't sound that different, especially over the phone to a person who just met us. so mrs.mcmichael went downstairs to make sure he wasn't waiting in the lobby and told us to not answer the door or the phone because we had just met our first predator and it probably wouldn't be our last. this guy was 30 years old! and he knew we had just graduated from high school because he asked about the size of our class. freakin scary!

so then monday we went to competition and i got a ONE on my solo! the judge said i did so well that he didn't want me to have to wait for results to know that i got a one...and my ensemble got a two, britt also got a two on her ensemble and a two on her solo.

and i had a dream about blake last nite...that sucked..a whole lot.

then today i went to work at 130 and when i went on lunch, i went to subway and as i was walking out blake was walking in so he got my attention and he gave me a big hug and asked how state went, and then i told him to have fun and be careful because they're leaving for cancun tomorrow and he said he'd call me when he got back and gave me another hug. i hate this, i mean it's just too hard for me to be close to him right now, it's like everytime he comes near me my heart just stops and then when he leaves my stomach starts hurting..it just absolutely sucks. seriously, as cliche as the song sounds, i understand the lyrics, ""Have you ever loved somebody so much it makes you cry?"" because i completely feel that right now. in fact, i feel a little sick right now, how pitiful is that?

so now i'm looking through a magazine and deciding how i'm cutting my hair tomorrow and then i've gotta do the dishes so i guess i'll post later.

tonite we went to tom's party, it was fun, i'm gonna miss those kids. tomorrow we've got jordan's party and then the lock-in, again, i'm excited..this is kinda cool, it's like we're finally free!

but i've been thinking about scott lately, it's tough graduating without someone..i drive by the spot where he died every day, sometimes two or three times a day and i've blown him a kiss everyday since the day after he died. and as ironic as it really is, the day after graduation is the 6 month anniversary..i can't believe it's been that long. but i guess it'll all be ok, just a little depressing. 

so now i'm gonna go get to bed since i've gotta get up at the crack of dawn.

oh yeah, jeff is sacker of the year and i'm cashier of the year..that's right, IT'S A BEST FRIEND THING!! lol k nite

"event","ya know sometimes i think i just have a sign on my forehead that says ""screw me over"" because it always seems to happen. like when you're finally happy and someone has to go and ruin everything by bringing up things from the past in front of your boyfriend. yeah and then when he gets pissed and accuses you of cheating on him. and then you break up because he doesn't realize that it doesn't count when you're drunk and broken up. and i mean i realize why he's upset, shit, i would be too but we were broken up, had been for at least a month, and i was drunk off my ass. it was a mistake, everyone knows that and they should all know not to bring it up. i didn't tell him because i was afraid to lose him. and then the dumb ass guy who caused all of this shit has to go and talk about it, four months later, might i add, at a poker party, right in front of blake. good plan jackass, i could kill you right now. seriously i know we've got a volatile relationship and i even thought about ending things after graduation but i wanted it to be on good terms, we love eachother but it won't last given the circumstances, and now we're on bad terms because he thinks i don't care about anyone but myself. god, i'm so tired of high school bull shit, i've had more things spread about me this year than i ever have before in my life. and for some reason our relationship has become the center of everyone's gossip. everyone is talking about whitney and blake. wtf? who cares? just let us be happy! but that would be too easy and we can't have that so let's go and ruin it all by bragging and being a jackass. you know the sad thing is that i thought this guy and i were friends, but come to find out, he thinks its a trophy and isn't the least bit ashamed about anything.. funny how that comes out when you get a girl plastered and take advantage of it, huh? not to say it wasn't my fault, too, but i'm not the one who went around a week later telling everyone about it and i'm not the one who ruined a relationship between two people who loved eachother just so i could get a few pats on the back. screw this, i'm sick of it. i know who my friends are and i've realized that many people who call themselves my friend are really just in it for appearance sake. i'm so glad i've got 4 more days, i can't wait to get away from all this shit. and seriously, i really could kill him right now lol"

"event","oh how i hate being sick..it's called sinucitis, but i think it's really just the sinus infection from hell! graduation is in two weeks..holy crap i didnt' even realize how close it was! and i'm still not finished w/ tina's present, but she'll love it and that's all that matters. and i have no idea what to get blake..but he and tina are really the only ones i'm getting anything for because i love my friends but i'm practically broke lol and my birthday's next friday! that's right, in 6 days i'll officially be legal, as kt would put it :P the next few weeks are going to be so busy, i'm already exhausted just thinking about it! tonite i have emily's production at joe's cafe, and then molli and i (and blake if he's feeling better, but i'm not sure he will be because he hasn't been out of bed in four days) are going to johnny carino's for kt's bday party and then tomorrow i have tina's grad party and next friday is my family dinner for my bday and then saturday is mer and al's grad party and then molli and blake are throwing a party for me and then the NEXT weekend is graduation which means grad practice on friday, and it's also chance's bday so we'll probably all do something, and i'm helping kt move into her apartment that afternoon, and then graduation on saturday and then the next morning i leave for state and won't be back until tuesday! i mean if i make it through all of this then i'll make it through anything! 
we had our choir concert thursday nite. i was running a freakin 104 temp but i still smiled when i was dancing damnit! lol then i gave my farewell speech, since i'm the president it's pretty much a must that i thank everyone and whatnot. yeah, i cried. it was really sad i mean that was my last performance with my choir! and i called my dad today and told him i'm not inviting his wife to my graduation. i've been putting that off for a long time just because i knew it would hurt his feelings but i mean hell, why would i even want her there? she's the reason i don't have a relationship w/ my dad anymore. it's actually kinda funny to me that she thought she was invited in the first place! anyway i think i'm gonna go get in the shower and start getting ready for tonite, love you!

"event","so i'm probably the worlds worst at updating, huh? so nothings really happened since i posted last...blake and i are over..again..for good i swear..got voted stupid most changed in high school in the senior class favorites. i mean really, what is that? that's like most improved! but i'm over that, no biggie, at least i got voted, right? umm..went and saw gary allen and ccr again, and i also got to see my idol miranda lambert in concert. god i wanna be her! jamesiepoo came back to brookshires! i'm excited about that..me, jake, trey, vulgy, and chelsea went to the longview rodeo last nite. it was alrite, we had fun but that's mainly because the trips there and back were a blast. we crammed five of us in my truck and i let jake drive us up there. then trey got us lost about seven times because he was already drunk and it ended up taking us an hour and a half to get there but then it took me 30 mins to drive us back..don't ask me how, probably because i speed. chance showed me the tux he ordered for prom..shut up, what good taste he has! it's all black w/ a white tie and my dress is all white w/ a black neckline so i'm pretty pumped about that. and james got the same one in white so elle and i will def be there w/ the most stylish guys in school. i mean after all, james was on the best dressed in high school ballot! :p and tomorrow we're going to the rangers game as a class so i'm pretty excited about that. oh yeah! erin and i are getting an apartment, i forgot about that! can't wait! and jake and josh allen are getting one next door to us so they can keep an eye on us (at least that's the reason they're giving us but we  know it's really so we can sober them up when their parties get out of hand and to cook them breakfast lol) but i mean the sad part is that we're totally serious so i'm pretty pumped. and the seniors don't have to go to school until 11:30 all next week so i get to sleep in every day except i have to take em to school every morning, that sucks. umm what else? oh! and thursday we're having a pow-wow and everyone's coming to my house to have bbq and then we're all going to james' to camp all nite, that'll be exciting. and then sunday nite i'm going w/ jake and everyone to the lake and we're staying the nite out there since monday is memorial day so that'll be fun, too. ok nothing else i guess..i'm gonna go finish stuffing my face w/ pizza. 

ps. best friend jeffiepoo is the best best friend in the entire world of living and i love him very very much. even if he always says no to going everywhere and he thinks my mom's hot. but that's ok because i love him for who he is and nothing less :P"

"event","hmm..long time no post, huh?

well let's see. sang all week for the baseball games, did ok the first few times and then it got good by the third. i saw coach monday and he called me out and said ""come here and give me a hug because i want to be able to say i really knew you when you're famous. every time you sang it, it got better and better, i swear the last time you sang it i was thinking 'that's it, that's how the national anthem was meant to be sang'."" so you know, that made my day. that and everyone coming to support me, it really did mean a lot to me, i love yall! oh and then the added effect of the other baseball teams cheering for me and whistling lol, that's always good. it's kinda funny b/c i've had ppl coming up to me all week, at school, at work, at the games, and asking if i was the whitney who sang at the games and complementing me. i'm afraid i'm getting a big head! lol

and what else..friday i'm going to athens to see gary alan and ccr in concert again. soo excited! i went today and got an extremely cute outfit for it. can't wait.

and carrie and i went shopping today and i got the best pair of shoes. god i love antonio melani, he's genius i swear! 

OH! and i forgot the best part! chance asked me to prom today. finally. lol i've known for about a week that he was gonna b/c the guys let it slip and so i was anxious all week but he finally got it out today and i'm thrilled. and his mom is probably the cutest in the world, she came up to bonnie and me in the library today and walked right past me while whispering to bonnie over her shoulder 'so did anything happen today at lunch?' and bonnie replied w/ 'yes, he asked her! way to be discrete!' and so mrs. heck goes 'whitney, do you have a date to prom? and is his name chance heck?' and then she giggled and started planning everything and i'm real excited. and then today after school me and meredith and allison went to sonic because we wanted to and kye was there and when he got off the phone w/ chance he goes 'whit, do you have a date to prom?' funny how that's exactly what his mom said. i love their family, we're gonna have a blast. so now i just have to get adam to ask bonnie and kevan to ask tina and find allison and meredith and carrie dates and we're all set.

and tomorrow i've got an appointment to get my nails done. finally. and me, meredith, and allison are having a hair party and we're all dying our hair tomorrow nite. wish us luck! lol

and thats it, gotta go call ashley back..
ly-whitney

ps. feel better soon best friend jeffiepoo!!"

"event","so in two hours i'm singing for the baseball game..wow, i mean i've sang in public before, no biggie, but this time it's solo. not just solo, but a capella. and it's outside. in the cold. that's tough! i mean c'mon no pressure, it's just every person i know, that's all lol but yeah so i'm a little nervous about that...i told tina i was gonna sound like her dog, shiner but she insists i wont so that makes me feel better. 

and omg today i realized we graduate three months from yesterday. that's like 12 weeks! and in a few months my tina beana will be in college station. but i guess i'll be ok since my best friend jeffiepoo is the best in the entire world..unless he goes off to tsu which in that case i'm stuck here for a year best friend-less!

and cory just told me that ccr, randy rogers, and gary allan are coming to athens soon...you probably just don't know how much i love gary allan..i'm not just a fan, we're involved. lol and miranda lambert april 2!! pumped about that, she's probably the best in texas and the sweetest girl i've ever met. wow, that's cool, i actually know a recording artist! lol and what else? found a prom dress. beautiful, flawless, perfect, but it's $500 so looks like graduation gift? hopefully..and symphonettes is this saturday and well, since blake and i broke up i don't have a date so either molli and i are going together or neither one of us are going and i'm babysitting blake's brothers and sister..weird, i know but i love his family and we're still close. ok so that about wraps it up. wish me luck, i'm still nervous!

oh and my best friend jeffiepoo is the best best friend ever!!

"event","first things first, jeff's a gay ass & tina's a furby who wants to be a unicorn lol.

today pretty much sucked. i went to work at nine and after hours of watching the clock creep by, i got off at three and talked to blake for like a minute before he had to go to work. i miss him, i didn't get to see him at all today..but school will be back in soon and i'll get to see him everyday, even if it is just for a little while. and then i came home and went for a run..well, kinda.. i ran for two miles and walked for two, but that's still pretty good. and then i got home and blake called on his break and then i got in the hot tub and now here i am, talking to jeff about being a gay ass and tina about being a furby. but in my defense they both deserved it, jeff called me a fat black hippo lady and tina called me a dwarf lol. and new rule is, i don't wanna know what happens when i'm drunk jeff. if i don't remember there's a reason for it. never bring it up again because tina and i will stab you and your sorry ass. ok love you best friend and ill see yall later

"event","so i was looking thru my archives of lj history and came across this thing that i apparently wrote. gah, at what point of my life could i right? i sure as hell can't now! lol anyway, its kinda funny to read something now that i wrote like a year ago. so here it is..

confusion unwinding
completion unfolding
purpose bewildering
this is love that i'm holding.

emptiness dimenishing
soul-fire burning
unknown emotions racing
i hope this is worth finishing.

void is filling
scars are mending
load is lifting
cold nights are ending.

hearts are pounding
minds are racing
adoration arising
this is worth finishing.

boundaries crossed
flaws overseen
walls conquered
it's no longer a dream.

eyes finally open
differences disregarded
life regains meaning.
True love is never finished, so i leave this incomplete."

"event","so it's finally 2005 and we've only got five months to go! yay! and last nite was probably the best new years eve i've had in forever. it's great to spend time with people who aren't two-faced for a change *Coughmeredithcough* but nevermind that. wow, lol so i got to blakes late because i had to go by my mom's party which sucked but i got there around 11:30 so it was still ok. and it was me, blake, katie (martin), and justin (allen) and then connor (vrba) and chase (wood) drove up right behind me so we popped firecrackers and they let me and katie play with roman candles which wasn't the best idea b/c i almost caught a tree on fire and katie practically torched all of the cars but we had fun, and then zach (lofties) showed up and he and blake set off the big fireworks that katie and i dubbed the grand finale. but we missed the countdown b/c we were playing with fire..that was kinda sad, but only me and katie thought so, they guys didn't care that much lol. so then we went inside to play a little poker and since i don't know how, blake and i were on a team *btw i suck lol..bluffing isn't exactly my forte* so then jordan cooper and mattie came over and played but jordan got pissed because he kept losing so they left at like 1:30 and then something happened so chase left to go find layne and zach and connor went after him because they're nosey lol and then gage and adam and chance and james came over and played with us, that was fun. and i must say, katie's a pretty good like poker player, she left w/ $20 lol. and then around 3:30 katie and i left and had our little slumber party at her house so that was fun...the stupid boys didn't go to sleep until 5:30 and then blake complained about being sleepy all day today lol. 

anyway i hope everyone had a great and safe new year's eve and i hope 2005 is everything you wished for! ily guys!

"event","It was beautiful today, i think scott would've been happy with it. me, tina, bonnie, and becca went and got him a dozen light pink roses. his favorite color. we took them to the cross, said a prayer for him, signed the ribbon, and cleaned the trash up near the road in front of the scene. today was good. i think we'll be fine, we just needed a little closure. Light blue ribbons to match his light blue casket. it was perfect. we laughed and cried and talked about the ways he got us every time. dropped your pocket, your flip flop's untied, there's a dead cockroach crawling by. so many ways for him to get us, and they won't be the last.

i love you guys, please know that. and be careful..seriously, just think about it next time. getting somewhere on time isn't worth your life, trust me.

"event","The past two days have been the roughest i've had in quite some time. Yesterday morning i pulled into the school parking lot behind Scott Baker just like i do everyday..it was rainy and slick and he was driving like a maniac like he always does. So seventh period comes around and just like always me, scott, and jake get in trouble for causing mischief :P anyway, the bell rings to let school out and as we're walking out i tell scott to start slowing down and drive careful b/c it's rainy and he was driving way too fast. ""Whitney, you worry too much about me, I'll be fine. See you tomorrow!"" and he hugs me. Little did i know that fifteen minutes later, my friend, Scott Everett Baker would die on his way to Joe and Matt's house after skidding on 346, flipping his truck, and wrapping it around a tree. Cory knew he and i were close so when he heard about it he came up to me and said there had been an accident and i just assumed it was no big deal and he would get a ticket and that was the worst part. but when i laughed and said ""I told him to slow down..is he ok?"" and cory looked at me and said ""Whitney, i think he's dead"" i didn't believe him. i was at work so i hadn't heard about it until five, but when cory came back in after confirming, he walked up to me and just nodded and i lost it. i left my customers standing there and ran to the bathroom. i had just seen him two hours ago and he hugged me and told me he'd see me tomorrow. he promised. they made me go home last nite. said i was scaring the customers, and i'm sure i was lol. and after crying all nite i thought today would be ok. boy was i wrong. i lost it the second i pulled into the school and scott wasn't in front of me. then i noticed someone else had parked in his spot. god people can be so disrespectful. anyway i settled down a bit until jake walked up and he lost it. jake doesn't cry infront of anyone, especially me. he's always the strong one but this time he was shaking and crying and we were a wreck. he helped me thru the rest of the day. i dont think i would've made it thru english without him. i walked into seventh period (english) where i sat beside scott. me, jake, molli, and scott. we were a group. we always talked thru the lesson and helped eachother out on the tests. we were always laughing at some inside joke. and now it's just the three of us. scott couldn't keep up with his english notebook so he gave me and molli all of his papers to keep. we still have them. i don't know what to do with them. he told me yesterday that i couldn't skip class today because we had to make up a test we missed last week and he was gonna need some help. that was scott. i can't believe he's gone. we were all talking last week about how we're almost done, how we're almost out of here. all period i just expected scott to walk thru the door and yell, ""yall fell for it AGAIN!"". i expected him to be waiting around the corner after sixth period and for him to try to trip me like he always did when i wore heels. i expected him to run thru the halls before school yelling ""ONLY 13 MINUTES TILL THE BELL RINGS!"" and watch the kids run to class. i still can't fathom that he's gone. scott was my comic relief. he was there to lighten the mood for all of us. why didn't he just listen to me yesterday at three when i told him to slow down? why couldn't he just take three more minutes to get to the pallitto's house? He was almost there. we were almost out. i went to the sight today and stood at the cross. i was numb. i was going to go to visitation tomorrow but i don't think i can. im going to the funeral, but only because jake said he'd stay with me. ive never dealt with this before. i don't understand why it had to be a senior from whitehouse. why it had to be one of my friends. why it had to be scott. i'm all cried out."

My truck is supposedly going to be finished today, and if it's not i'm gonna shoot 'em all because it's been in the shop for almost three weeks now and i'm tired of driving the rental truck and smelling like i smoke three packs a day. pre-area tryouts were a week from yesterday..not cool considering i have to be careful about how much i sing since i have nodes on my vocal chords (for those who don't know what they are, they're blisters and calluses on your vocal chords from overuse which equals deep shit for a music major) OH! so last friday when i swore i saw a murder? well i wasn't completely wrong, but i was mistaken. it turns out a bunch of dumbasses were joking around and pretending to beat each other up to scare the crap out of girls who drive by. which they succeeded at, greatly.

i don't think there's anything else. other than i hate brookshires with a passion but i'm forever doomed to work there as long as my mom has a say in it. so i'll see you kids later!

First the senior choir members sang the national anthem and becca ruined my high note, then we all had our silly string fight and were hugging and having a blast when jennalee comes up to me with tears in her eyes..which never happens..and she hugs me and tells me she's gonna miss me. oh wow, that's when the water works started. i mean i know we have another semester to go, but still. it was our last pep rally! so i cried the whole way home and then met tina at her house for the game, and we went to brookshires to get money and ate at subway and decided not to go to the game afterall because we're cool and we can do that. and also because i knew i'd cry again if i went and i decided i was all cried out for the day. so we went to best buy to get a few cds and then drove around talking forever. it's so great to have a best friend you can talk to about everything. and then anyway since my parents are gay and wouldnt let me go to the movies, i went home and she went out w/ all of the guys. and then i picked emily up and went to sonic. THEN..this is the scary part...on my way home i was going down blackjack road, which is really dark and windy, and i saw this truck parked in a driveway thats not usually there. well, dumb blonde me, i was thinking they might be broken down or something so with the windows rolled down, i slowed down to see if they needed any help. and just as i rolled up, someone took off running in the other direction like they were doing something wrong and i SWEAR i saw a guy laying in the ditch so i freaked out and sped off thinking i had just witnessed a murder but i haven't heard anything on the news so i'm guessing all of those years of my obsession with scary movies and unsolved mysteries got the best of me. then we left saturday to go hunting, didn't see a damn thing, and now i'm home. wow. that was a long version of nothing :P anyway, i've gotta go, mom has to pay bills :/

"event","So i've never been good at keeping up with journals. ever..which explains why i go for long spells without posting. 

so the past few weeks, huh? wow, nothing new really. last week was something else tho. the parents went to illinois for a week so i had the house to myself. had a few people over monday night which i know you heard about. and then i had major drama at school because apparently all of a sudden i'm fake? who knew! and oh yeah, wrecked mom's truck a bit and i was scared to death of what she'd do to me, but she's cool with it, i just have to pay for it. thank god. and friday we had homecoming. we lost, but it was still fun. ashley said she's going to TSU w/ me so we're gonna be roomies. (no kidding, she's serious, which is great) and we're gonna get boob jobs and work at hooters, i'm excited! and all of a sudden i have a bad-girl rep, which i don't really like but whatever, i mean if i'm gonna get punished for having fun, screw them, right? 

and other than that, nothing new. wait, i did drink orange juice out of the carton today, does that make me a boy?

goodnight for now,

"event","so wow, second week of school, huh? actually it's not bad. easy=good..except for anatomy..i'm gonna have to work at that one. 

hahahaha jeff and andrew and drew had to start school yesterday-sucks doesn't it? i'm a bad friend tho, i was supposed to text drew today at 10 to wake him up for class and i kinda lost track of time and didn't get it to him until 10:30 lol oops? 

let's see..what else? umm, oh yeah, all-region sucks this year, i'm more than likely not going to even get close to state, which sucks..if it wasn't for that dang french piece! 

also, it's stupid not to sell cokes at lunch because i have to have my minimum four 20 oz diet cokes a day, as do all of the girls i eat lunch with, so looks like me, meredith, alison, and cayti are all bringing 2 liters to school and keeping them in scottie's locker so we can have them at lunch. and if you think about it, the majority of whitehouse is almost too skinny. technically most of the population could be deemed anorexic according to proportions, so i don't think these new obesity laws should apply to us.. 

and i still have to get sr pics. oops?

did i mention i cut my hair off? yeah..i did

and ex-boyfriends suck because no matter how much you try not to let them get to you, they do.

yep, so other than that, nothing new.

"event","so today since my mom's such a fitness freak and pushes her daughters to be perfect, we measured. wow. ok so at least my mom and sister are actually proportional! i mean mom is 31,41,31; emily is 39,33,42; and whitney? yeah..my ass is LITERALLY a freakin FOOT larger than my waist! i mean what kinda person is 36,28,40? that doesn't even begin to fit together! and jen talked me into actually going full out and completely redoing my hair so i'm getting a medium pixie cut with choppy bangs and going back to my ash blonde color. i'm scared, but she says i have to so i'm gonna. and that's it. i blew off my appt today because i wasn't sure how i wanted it done but now that i do know i'm going friday to regis and there's no turning back. 

**NOTE** pick up senior shirts friday 3-6 at up a creek. $15 cash.

ok, off to tan and run. i think this year i'm gonna start running at the school just because i've got commitment problems and i only push myself when ppl are around.."

This is a new beginning, albeit a lonely and scary one. There may be times that you lose sight of what lies ahead and you may not even want to go on to meet it. But in the end I can't tell you what to do or what to think or what to believe. So I will not dictate nor will I judge.<br /><br />Just remember you are loved.

"event","Hello Livejournal. It's nice to see you again.<br /><br />---<br /><br />You know what I miss? I miss being Filipino. You see, it's like this: America is beautiful. America teaches you to stand on your own two feet and be your own person. It teaches you how to not take crap and smile like nothing happened. It takes you for a ride, in&nbsp;one of it's&nbsp;2008 Mercedes S-class sedans, Chris Brown blaring on your stereo hooked up to your i-pod while you laugh and scream on your bluetooth i-phone.<br /><br />But you see, as many a thing America can possibly teach you, it doesn't know about where you came from.&nbsp;Sure you'll&nbsp;go to that cultural festival, but that little child singing, &quot;Bayang magiliw, Perlas ng sinananaaaang!!&quot;&nbsp;will not be&nbsp;singing it that way to be droll. And the people in the audience will not clap in delight because they know her lyrics are adorably erroneous but because oh! That child sings Tagalog songs so well! It's so nice to see parents teaching their children their beloved culture!<br /><br />Because here, you <em>will</em>&nbsp;buy that $6 bottle of Palmolive coconut shampoo, and you <em>will</em> go to that sad place that passes itself for Jollibee with their sad, sad Chicken Joy and gravy, and you <em>will</em>&nbsp;get that t-shirt with Manny&nbsp;Pacquiao's&nbsp;face benevolently surveying that&nbsp;limp Philippine&nbsp;flag tied haphazardly onto that flagpole&nbsp;bearing the American flag. <br /><br />Because you have to. And because you have no choice. <br /><br />Because this place, America, is about adapting. <br /><br />It's about turning your scathing, over-analytic, ethnocentric&nbsp;eyes away from the revelry that becomes carnage in your&nbsp;mind because that is how you want to see it.<br /><br />But damn, I still want my Chicken Joy."

"event","I had a good day today.<br /><br />First good thing that happened to me today was that I got a free eggnog latte from Starbucks. So when&nbsp;my sister dropped me off too early for work, I went to the corner Starbucks to get whatever. The&nbsp;barista was this guy who usually was their runner who comes by almost everyday and so&nbsp;when I held&nbsp;out my credit card he said, ""Oh no don't worry, it's&nbsp;on me.""<br /><br />Orayt.<br /><br />The&nbsp;next deserves a bit of explanation before I tell you about the&nbsp;actual event.<br /><br />I work in a very affluent and&nbsp;high end&nbsp;neighborhood that has cafes with&nbsp;$15 dollar plates of ravioli; a predominantly white,&nbsp;either young and&nbsp;fashionable or old&nbsp;moneyed white haired&nbsp;crowd;&nbsp;and clothing from Paris and England.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp;after my lunch I took a walk outside and the valet guy Louis called me over and&nbsp;asked if I wanted to see someone famous. I said heck yeah and so&nbsp;he pointed inside the&nbsp;Country Mart&nbsp;and inside the&nbsp;store that sells knives for 50 bucks a pop was the lovely Tom Hanks.<br /><br />I didn't get an autograph though since he&nbsp;was&nbsp;""in a rush"" and he said he comes by often anyway so&nbsp;he could humor us ""next time"". Aha ha&nbsp;ha.<br /><br />Pfft.&nbsp;<br /><br />Next week I'll just hang&nbsp;around Starbucks and I might catch&nbsp;Schwarzenegger glugging macchiatos with his scary-lookin' wife.&nbsp;<br /><br />Peace, Mrs. Terminator.<br /><br /><br />---<br /><br /><br />Tomorrow is turkey wrestling day.<br /><div class=""ljembed"" embedid=""""><lj-embed id=""28"" />&nbsp;<br />Good luck with that, Aisha.<br /></div>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;"

Ang astig ng public library system nila, nakakabaliw. So this is where Californians get their taxes put into: extremely organized and well-stocked shelves, flat screen lcds,&nbsp;a good website, friendly librarians (since college, i've had a fear of menopausal library ladies) dvds and audiobooks.&nbsp; 

Okay, so when it comes to books I can be pretty much a geek. I loooove libraries. I remember when I was around five or&nbsp;six and I always was at the public library in the valley with my mom and sister. I frikin loved books before I even learned to read. My mom told me I used&nbsp;to look through books when I was around three as if I understood what those squiggly black lines meant.&nbsp;

I'm kinda wondering now why I didn't take up a BA in Creative Writing.

Anyway, a few meters away from the West LA Public Library is a store called Cinefile. And Oh. My. Gah. Ohmygah. Para siyang Video 48 (is it 48 or do i forget what the number really is?) pero i-multiply mo yung Video 48 by 100. 

So parang,

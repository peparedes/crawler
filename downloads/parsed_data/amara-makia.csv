     Wow, I haven't been on in what seems forever when only it's been a couple of months, but I have a lot to talk about for just those few months.
<font color=""red-orange""/>
<font color=""aquamarine"">
<br>
     Let me start off by saying that I had a <i>fantastic<i/> summer.
<font color=""aquamarine""/>
<br>
<font color=""blueviolet"">
     My sister left for college and yes, I cried, but only because she's the one person who's always been there for me.
<font color=""blueviolet""/>
<br>
<font color=""forestgreen"">
     The same day my sister left and we were driving back from the Greyhound Station, I had seen the one thing that I never thought would happen and would change my Sunday evenings <i>forever.<i/>
<font color=""forestgreen""/>
<br>
<font color=""seagreen"">
  <i>Wichita was having an anime festival<i/>, conveniently named the AFW (Anime Festival Wichita). My eyes had widened a fraction of an inch and right then i knew I had some research to do. 
<font color=""seagreen""/>
<br>
<font color=""red"">
     Only two days after that my sister gave me last weeks Sunday paper telling me that she thought I might've wanted to see it and right there on the front cover was picures of anime and an article on the up-coming event.
<font color=""robinblue""/>
<br>
<font color=""hotpink"">
     I did go to the AFW but I didn't talk to anybody else except my two friends, one of which I forced to come along because I thought she might like it. 
<font color=""hotpink""/>
<br>
<font color=""green"">
     And why did this change my Sunday's forever? Well, that's because there are boards for people who attended the AFW (1200 people showed up, and for the first festival for anime in Wichita that was a large amount) only about 90 people are on the boards, me being one of them, and everybody there usually sets up different places to go every Sunday, which I find fun, because I never get to get out of the house.
<font color=""green"">
<br>
<font color=""pink"">
     The other event I have to tell you about is that I have moved, no longer do I live in the disgusting duplex's but now a fourplex with loud neighbors upstairs and small amount of area to walk around (I'm used to going up and down stairs and that makes a place seem bigger).
<font color=""pink"">
<br>
<font color=""maroon"">
     Those are really the most exciting things that have happened to me, both were very good on my part, the moving was slightly stressful, but it was worth it. Schools started again, and it seems to be moving at the speed of light to catch up to the next AFW. Oh and if you don't know about it than you should type in AFW google and click the link that says afw.peterpixieproductions.com.

Today was kind of blah. I tried reading more of <i>The Dove and the Rose</i> but it didn't work out to well considering I was up from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. and yes I know that doesn't sound like that long only 12 hours, but lately I've been getting more and more tired. Though that's probably because school is finally out and I'm making up for all the early mornings I had to wake up.
</font>
<br>
<font color=""midnightblue"">
I've been trying to screw up my sleeping schedule and it's finally worked. Now I'm up during the night until the latish morning. 
</font>
<br>
<font color=""darkblue"">
I woke up at 1 p.m. after I finally fell asleep at 7 a.m. I wanted to bang my head against the wall because I had forgotten that I had to vacuum the downstairs though it ended up I forgot about it (or made myself forget about it) till my mom got home and she screamed at me and gave me the usual <i>""Why do I have to do all the house work?""</i> speech. I just rolled my eyes at her though and told her that I might do it later or tomorrow (my mom always likes things done by Saturday morning at the latest) when I would be in a better mood and might actually clean the whole basement which is a big whoop for me. I ended up doing it all today only because I wanted my money for the the weeks chores today.
</font>
<br>
<font color=""teal"">
I'm trying to save my money (which will only take a week and a half) so I can get the new (well I guess not so new) Good Charlotte album and the Beautiful Soul album (I'm a sucker for Jesse's music). I was wanting to save my money up all summer so I could get some stuff for my room but that's going to go down the drain. Maybe I'll just put some money off to the side and use my other money for CD's and DVD's and blah blah blah and so on and so forth.

Today was boring, like usual (I guess I can't say today considering I mean yesterday). I tried reading <i> The Dove and the Rose</i> by Ethel Herr but I didn't get to far... I seem to get bored of reading really easily and it bugs me because I love reading.
</font>
<font color=""navy"">
I'm a fan fiction reader so I read constantly. Though doing so puts me in a bad situation. You wouldn't understand though, well maybe you would but I don't want to seem silly and childish. Maybe it's only because teenagers try making their lives out more dramatic then they really are. I find it pathetic that I'm actually going through that but oh well, I can't change that.
</font>
<font color=""darkgreen"">
My sister is going to be leaving in July to go to Collins College in Arizona which is soon. I'm kind of happy while at the same time sad, I'm not the type of person who likes living in the same place for a long period of time and I don't get to travel often (even though my dream is to go to Japan), so dropping my sister off in Arizona is a big deal. That's the only reason I'm happy, well that and the fact that I don't have to share the computer except the occasional times my mom needs it. Otherwise I won't have anyone to really talk to, considering my other sister, a biatch from hell who's going to try and make me babysit which I won't do because the only reason she would want me to babysit is because she's going to go get drunk and she shouldn't be wasting her money on alcohol when she can't even afford her own home for herself and her child (she's 21), won't really be much to talk to.  
</font>
<font color=""indigo"">
It's almost 2 a.m. but I'm glad that it's stopped storming, even though I love to dance in the rain, I don't like to put more gloom to the day then what's already been put upon it.
</font>
<font color=""saddlebrown"">
My mom and I got into a argument today, well nothing more than the usual. She complains that she has to do all the housework and the such and says that's why she never gets to spend any time with my sister and I, and then I yell at her and say that's not because she works all the time that's because her two-timing boyfriend wants to borrow my moms truck so he can go over to his other girlfriends house. I think my mom is just sick of being alone so she turns to someone to love her. Whenever I tell her that she always says she has us (my sister and I) but I tell her that it's maternal love we have for her and that she wants someone who will love her and not already have that instinct.

HTML takes forever... hehe XD
</font>
<font color=""red""> 
I made this blog just 'cause I don't think I could stand being on the computer and not do anything. It kind of sucks when I'm bored out of my mind, but ok...
</font>
<font color=""blue""> 
I went to the park today and the library with my sisters (who are both older then me). 
</font>
<font color=""green"">
I recommend reading the Bartimaeus Trilogy (even though the first 2 books are the only ones out).
</font>
<font color=""violet""> 
The park was ok, but I'm more of the vampire type who stay in their basement and stare at the computer or play video games and the such.
</font>  
<font color=""orange"">
My friend finally left yesterday, also, which I thank the gods for, because while she's lovable and funny, she smells <i>really</i> bad. You'd think being 13 you would know how to take a shower or a bath, but not her.
</font>
<font color=""indigo"">
The girl that lives next door to me (literally since I live in a duplex) has boy issues that seem to go on forever, (or maybe it's just 'cause she can't stop talking?) 'cause she wanted this guy who she knew nothing about, not even his name, and then starts liking another guy 'cause he looks exactly like the other dude. I feel so sorry for both of the guys, because she can't make up her mind.
</font>
<font color=""red"">
Yeah, yeah, I complain to much, but isn't that what blogs are for; to complain about people and tell about your day (which usually involves complaining about someone)?

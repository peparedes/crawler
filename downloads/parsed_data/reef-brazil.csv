FUCK YESSSSS. seriously love that place more than life. my favorite places to be- pavones costa rica, sebastian florida, with jeremy. danielle libby and i have become in seperable and i love it. ive been with them almost every day of summer. theyre so fucking fun. we all stayed in singer island last weekend. at canon sport. most likely the best weekend ive ever had. it was me heather ashley danielle and libby. anddd it was so fun. it felt like a vacation and it was so relaxing and its only 10 minutes away from home. so bens going to north carolina on thursday FUCK! that sucks so bad. lex is deffinetely chillen in new york right now gregors got his ass in boston with MAN-E. and foster dyed his hair brown? whats going on? i dont know. charles cut his hair. and i got new shoes in california. o leeeemme tel you about that. california was so fun. coachella 2 days of heaven 90 bands = AMAZINg. i met tj the old drummer of hearts over rome on the flight over there. (how random) yeah it turns out we live 5 minutes away from eachother annd we were both going to coachella and he wen tto dreyfoos and msoa. siiick. but anyways hes really cool. and manhattan beach california is amazing. really i got out of the car and i just looked out onto the pier and i was in awe. i had to keep reminding myself that i was in CALIFORNIA . like OMGSZAJG. we went to the santamonica pier fuck yesss i was standing where JAY FUCKING ADAMS stood at one point in his life. yeah we had a swank ass mexican dinner annnd we went thrift shopping like crazy. i got so much stuff. really cool shirts. and then comes coachella. we walk in. and the place is huge. im really thinking woodstock woodstock woodstock. there wer people camping out there and it was just amazing. it was like buzz bakesale times 8. there were 5 stages. and a techno stage. i saw blood brothers, prodigy, bright eyes. ok WEEZER i cant name them all but www.coachella.com there you go. but i had the longest talk with my mom outside when the faint was playing i think. i told her everythign and that i had smoked before and just everything and it was awesome. she trusts me so much more now. and i tell her whenever im gonna do something. so im starting to miss coachella alot and im deffinetely looking forward to seeing whos gonna be on the lineup for next year because i think were gonna go again. paige parkerrr yesss surf camp is starting up exactly tomorrow. it wil be sweet. except for the fact that its been raining non stop for a whole week. today we got lucky anddd i got to surf and we went to the beach. but ive had this couch for like 2 weeks and it wont go awayy and its getting baddd. but me and jeremy finally got to have time with eachother yesterday at my house for like 3 and a half hours haha hes the best cuddler everrrr. im gonna go to sleep though. thank you for listening to my whole life story.and im not a hippie kaythanksmike

"event","i went to civic center today and got rather burnt. i got grounded yesterday and couldnt go to rasta fest. stuff is so different. i had dejavu a bunch of times today. its so cool. but i miss alot of stuff. i miss going to sebastian every weekend with lindsay. i miss costa rica more than anything in the world. i miss livejournal. and checking to see if trevor left comments. and hanging out with sol 24/7. man do i miss mike trio and rob. ive seen better days. ive been the star of many plays. i hate change. i dont want to go to highschool. i want to go back to summer. i miss dustin. theyre tearing down the sailfish marina and canon sport marina. ive had so many memories there and its gona be so hard to just watch it all be torn away and condos put up. our summer will be partially not the same. no more jumping off the docks at sailfish or buying frozen fish and feeding them to the baracudas or.. so many other things. linday is my best friend and im sure she allways will be. all the friends i have now i used to be so unfamiliar with and all i ever wanted to do was hang out with them because they seemed so cool. but now people like dario and beshee are two of my really good friends. and i remember seeing charles like a year ago at gardens park and now hes one of my really good friends. everything goes by so fast. it was over a year ago the i went out wtih david and that alia was with brian. this whole myspace shit is so dumb. i think im gona delete mine. just for fun. and then get another one. i sound like such an emo faggot. i am but i love life except for the fact that things keep changing and they wont stop changing. i really cant wait until the time machine is invented. so thats it im deleting myspace and using live journal again. no one reads mine. but i dont care much. i would really like to be a singer in a hardcore band it would be fun as hell."

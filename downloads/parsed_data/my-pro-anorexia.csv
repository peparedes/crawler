"event","It's been almost A year shes cried at home,
She lost it all and its not his fault,
I think the blood on my fingers represent it all,

I never meant for this to happen,
I never wanted to hurt him,
Now my life is mixed up with problems,

I dont have him to answer my frightening questions,
I dont have him to hug the pain away,
and now my worlds incomplete.

I never knew what I had until i lost it all,
I never meant to loose control,
I thought i knew what i was doing but in the end, 
I guess i'm just a fuck up like everyone else,

He carried me on his back,
We tried so hard, 
I know i can do better,
because of my screaming heart!

I won't take this back,
I feel too  alone,
I've tried too hard to move on,
and it's pissed him even more.

Im the fuck up,
i'm glad you got out while you still could,
I miss the old days when you used to say ""don't worry, I'm here.""
I can't believe this has happened to me,
I guess I never knew myself and he's brought out the real me,
Im the fuck up,
and i'm glad you left me,
Even though It almost killed me."

"event","My name Is Krysia, I live with my father and step mother in Phoenix, Arizona.When I had a boyfriend, we were together for 11 months.As a matter of fact, Today would've been our 12th month together... I've known him for almost a year now. I swear I knew he was the one, but just shows that when you rely on someone for happiness,It'll never come eh? Uh!YEAH!...I really need to get in touch with who I am, and get help or something.Mentaly I mean, I want to be Anorexic,there's not really a reason, it's just something I feel I should do. But then again being with Chris (my ex) I thought I should be with him forever, I mean I KNEW...Or did I?... I think I did know, but He knew that I knew and didn't want me to know, Idk, i'm not going all hard-core thinking about it...its over, its painful...the end. I just hope he's happy. anyway, I listen to Metal,Punk,Screamo,Emo, Grudge, Acid, and Alt.Rock.Some of the bands i like/love listening to are: Pink Floyd, Sevendust, Metallica (old), The rolling stones, sumblime, System of a down, Three days Grace, Alixis on Fire, Mud Vayne, StoneSour, uh...and a lot more... Some movies I REALLY like are: Too young to be a dad, hunger point, Her last chance, Ghost Ship, Donny darko (that was Chris and my first movie we watched together, it resembled us a LOT), Grind, uhm... There's more so just fuck it.  I can't really tell you who I am, because I don't really know, I can tell you who I was... But That's not very interesting... anyway... Since I suck fuck, I think i'll leave you to your own duties online... I'm sure I bored you anyway..."

"event","Dear...Reader,
Today has been shit for me, I've had to take care of three boys of the ages 1,4, and 5. Then Clean a house that looked like the tornado from The Wizard Of Oz blew through. I got paid though, so I guess that's good, more money to by new cloths or something.I'm Pro-Anorexic (at moment)... Soon I'll be...someday... ANOREXIC!...Think i'm crazy all you want, fuck you. This is me... Get over it. 


Some of my friends have been freaking out, i've been ""pro-anorexic"" for about a month or two now... I think. i've been keeping the messuring of my wrists, legs, waist,and stomach, of course weight, but I just want to know how many inches are getting put off... hehe. I want to be able to see my rib bones and place a finger between each one, I want to be able to fit my thumb and my pointer finger around my wrist without touching my skin, I want to fit both my hands around my leg without touching the skin... It's not for ""diet"" it's just to make me happy...I know i'm thin right now, but as I see myself happy with what i look  like but not with what's around me, why not try to show people that they're effecting me and make myself look happier with my ribs being in visioned. I know no one will accept it, that's why I came on here.


After a tough break-up with my boyfriend, I don't want to eat anyway, I have no doubt that this will be hard, but I don't think it'll be easy either, I think it'll just be a lifesyle I'll pick up soon... very soon. I've been taking pills, of course also, they calm my mind and help me sleep. But I've got insomnia, so it doesn't totally, totally, work for sure. But anyway, I'm just explaining to myself why i want to do this, so at the end if i have any regrets I'll be able to see. I don't want to recover after this either, I want to be anorexic for the end of eternity. and i'm going to make sure that at least one thing in my life works out the way I WANT IT TO!... If I can't have someone love me for who i am, then fuck love, If I can't have a family that cares about me, then Fuck the family, If i can't have friends that will stand by me even if the dision is wrong, then FUCK IT... I've got myself and i've got my pills and I've got my computer and paper and a pen... It's all I need, so Whatever to the rest of the world who won't except me for who I really am."

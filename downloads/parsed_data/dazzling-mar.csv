"event","it's been forever since i've written in here.  bitchy girl with large ass who somehow thinks everything revolves around you and is about you and your past relationships--IT IS NOT.  I still think you are dillusional, fyi.  But you can go ahead and continuing your holyier than thou routine, you're really only fooling yourself.

Well i like it when things in life go my way.  :)  here's to positive relationships.  here's to getting on the right track.  here's to staying on the right track.  here's to hidden blessings.  and now for a good night's sleep, i am sleeping in and i am SO excited!"

"event","it's really hard when someone has, without trying, taken hold of such a huge part of your heart.  I think he knows it...but if he does he sure doesn't seem to care.  and then at the same time, he seems to care so much.  i have bren seriously infatuated before, but this is Way differnt.  Before it almost seemed as if it was more of the idea than teh real thing...but this seems realistic, and liek a real opportunity... well, it would if he reciprocated.  I can't tell if he likes me or if he is simply abusing my affection to get what he wants.  i do know that the way he grinned at me last time we were together, was not the way that friends look at each other.  Not in the least.  And the level of physical/sexual comfort? not to at the fuck-buddy level.  the falling asleep in e/o's arms? the gentle little wakeup kisses?  I don't know.  Then it's teh ignoring me for days, blowing me off, bla bla bla.  Its so dumb.  i amost think that he DOES like me, and just isn't ready for a relationship, so he has to be mean to make himself feel better? but then he has the times where he ""can't resist,"" or SOMETHING and he gives in?  i dont know...i don't know why i let myself get carried away in situations lkike this I guess it's just hard when you just KNOW that someone is so perfect for you...so worth it.  And I think thats why I let hm do what he wants, even though i know that i shouldn't be.  I am trying so hard to just back off, to let hiim come to me, to play hard(er) to get, to be kind, to not be psycho, to not be dependenat... aaaarrrrgh. can i have three wishes?"

"event","Wowowowow.  That's lots of wow's for those of you not fluent in Maren.  Wow.  life really works in a funny, funny way.  Just when you think you have something figured out, it changes.  The thing that just keeps coming up is honesty.  Why is it SO difficult to be honest right away?  It's hard for me, because I think I'm letting people know that I'm a safe person to open up to, and a safe person to share with, and that I can be there for them and they can be open with me.  I mean, I know that I am a whole barrel full of issues, but really, anyone who HAS opened up to me or asked me for help has really appreciated it.  Anyhow, my mind works in strange, strange ways.  THat was really not at all what I was planning on writing about.  Guess that means this journal is serving it's purpose.

Okay, So obviously I've been dealing with a LOT of shit lately.  Well,I've been trying really hard for the past...month or so, now to find a job.  NOTHING.  Eau Claire, and supposedly everywhere else, is just a job desert.  Well it's been really really discouraging.  So finally, I pretty much gave up hope, and i took a crap babysitting job.  $100/wk for almost 30 hrs is really not going to help me pay off my debt and pay for my rent and school.... HMMMMMM NO!  Well, I took that job anyhow, babysitting a 7 month old boy (yuck, boys squirt) and kept applying for others.  I figured I wouldn't really have any more luck.  BUT no sooner than I had accepted that one, I got two more interviews.  Well I had the first intivew for MCDonalds Playplace manager...which doesn't seem nearly as bad after they actually describe the duties and stuff to you.  I wasn't super excited about it, but it seemed barable.  The interview was a little strange... if anything, i all of this job bullshit, I 'm getting a lot of interview experience, In a lot of different settings...  I'm learning more about resumes and cover letters and expectations and what works-and what doesn't.  And yet at the same time, I have NO clue why some things are working and others are not.  So I had that interview, and then I interviewed at Guyers Home Liesure center.  First of all, I went to the wrong place...tehre are two affiliated stores...on the same road.  I was there early, and when I looked in the store, i was like HOly crap, there is no possible way I can handle this job.  I cannot sell applicances.  I was going back and forth, just thinking about not going in at all, just blowing it off, thinking about calling and syaing i got antoher job, something,  Then  I swas like, okay, I'll go in, and I'll interview.  I don't even know if i will get the job, I can at least have the interview experience and I can turn down the job if i do happen to get the offer... So i went in, and went to the desk, and they were like, um, Greg is at the other store... Then I felt like a big idiot.  But they were nice, they told me how to get there, It was jsyut like 2 blocks away.  When I got to that store I felt a LOT better, and luckily i was RIGHT on time .  The store was way more up my alley, and i felt comfortable.  It seemed like a peaceful place, and the guy that greeted me was really nice.  So i met Greg and had the interview, and it seemed to be going okay, but i wasn't sure really how.  So then, out of nowhere, he offered me the job.  I was totally shocked, and usually i'm pretty good about hiding the random thoughts that go through my head...but i showed it like none other.  Then i felt like an ass, and he kinda laughed at me.  I fell comfortable though, which is good.  I totally see that he will be a MUCH better manager than tom is.  It's cool, because I will be doing Lighting sales, and then soon Patio Furniture sales.  The job pays an hourly rate substantially higher than Pier 1, PLUS there is a commission.  It isn't a huge commission, but when you're selling large things and large amounts, it will add up at least a little...and maybe eventually a lot.  If nothing else, It is a motivator... It gives you a reason to do well at work, instead of like pier 1 where you can bust your fucking ass and get jack shit... or even yelled at for not doing better, or not getting it on a charge card, or not getting them to sign up for the damn email program.  It's pretty rediculous overall.  So anyhow, I accept that job.  Then, the very next morning, I get a call for second interview for playplace manager.  I still can't imagine i'd get it.  I mean, the last one was a late 40's stay at home mom kinda lady, and most of the staff is older... Would they really want a twenty year old college flunkie doing it?!  I did accept the interview, we'll see how it all goes... The thing Is, I want to applly for the internship this summer, and I want more than anything to be back in school in teh fall.  So i want jobs that can work around that.  I could easily handle Pier 1 and Guyers at the same time with school.  I do SO much better when I have a full schedule because I actually have to manage my time instead of having too much time and thus taking it for granted.  I'd quit pier 1, but I want to be a manager.  I really do like it, I'm so comfortable there, I know the store, I know the rules, I just know it ALL.  It's like my home.  Yeah, some parts of the job suck, and I complain about it constantly, but really, are places gonna be much better?  I know that really soon I'm gonna have to quit the babysitting job, and I feel awful.  I feel really irresponsible...and like I'm letting them down.  I wish it was simple to wedge them all together.  ONce I know my guyers schedule I guess I'll know better.  If i can have a set schedul at each place, then it would work out great...  I don't think it would be that hard, its just kind of a matter of how that would work out, if it would piece together okay....  

Love.  Ha.  So, is it easier to be happy when you have a someone special?  Do you need friends less when you have a someone special?  Do your friends matter less in that instance?  Maybe things are happening in my life relationship wise, to sho me what I have done wrong in my past ratltionships.  I mean, I KNOW that once I started being with fat josh I totally ignored everyone else.  Heck, I didn't even talk to my best friends from home barely during that time, and I never hung out with my other friends at school.  I feel so guilty, because I know that this person deserves to have something (read: Someone) wonderful in her life, but at the same time I'm jealous.  Jealous of him, because he gets to spend time with her, and jealous of her, because she found a wonderful guy-who thinks she's wonderful too.  You know, good action, good company, good talk, comfort, everything... So, will that ever happen to me for real?  I know, it isn't something  that I should be worried about, especially at this point in my life.  And i'm not overly worried about it... I mean, I'm not out actively looking, I'm just not adverse to the idea.  And i don't get why it seems as if wonderful things are happening to so many people... 

The question that keeps coming to mind is, if you're 21+ and have a significant other, does that make you happy?   I mean, should I just start counting down the days to my birthday and searching the personals?  Or does sleeping around mean success and acceptance? Because that seems to be a common thing with many of the people I know.  As  does out of sight out of mind... I am constantly thankful for the handful of people who remember that I'm here and that I still want to be a part of things, and that my situation is temporary...  I know i've not always made the right decision, and I know i have not always been the nicest, but was I like this?

So strange.  

I knwo that some of the decisions I make are not the ones that are the most positive.  Yet I can't seem to stop them. But at the same time, are they really hurting anything.  Words, even when they are of a very explicit nature, can be just fine.  If you trust hte person they are being shared with, does it matter?  Or is there really nobody that can be trusted?  Are conversations, photos, certain types of relationships going to ruin my future?  As far as I can tell, I haven't really made any that are going to ruin my life... I know i have made some that put things on hold, and will make it so I need to work a lot harder from NOW on, but those things aren't even the sexual thigns that my mom and dad think I have done or am doing that are going to ruin my life.  It's absolutely rediculous.  

I'm having such a huge trouble wrapping my thoughts around everything that is happening.  I know  what I want in a month, two months, three, 6... I know what I want in 5 years.  I know personally, relationship wise, job wise, education wise.  I just don't know exactly how to get these thigns.  and THAT is the hard part.  Knowing where to go and what is actually the right hting to do is so hard.  I think the hardest part for me might be accepting the fact that I can't have all the answers right now, and I might not be able to get them ever... And what's hard is that the person I want answers about doesn't like when I ask the  questions, and it pushes him further away, which makes that situation worse....

Well, once again I have tired myself out... but at least i'm almost caught up on my shows!  


dreamin' about osmeone special I hope.... ;)"

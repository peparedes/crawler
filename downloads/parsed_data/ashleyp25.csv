<P>Look up Cindy Sherman on Google (e.g., <A href=""http://www.masters-of-photography.com/S/sherman/sherman.html"">Cindy</A> <A href=""http://moma.org/collection/depts/photography/blowups/photo_025.html"">Sherman </A>.) Are such photos different from candid photos of the sort which might be taken on family occasions? Or is there a staged quality to family photos? 
<P><FONT color=#993399>The photo below is one that I remember that was in my art book last semester from Cindy Sherman. In all of the pictures she has taken, all the them seem like they are depressing or in actuality. They catch people at real things in life. I remember my art teacher saying that she had a picture taken to look like she had just been raped. One of the photos made her look dead(below). All of the photos are of her and she is alone. They are in all different kinds of places. None, except for the one below, are of her smiling. Family pictures are almost always of people smiling, which, a lot of that is fake. The last picture which I have shared is disturbing to me. It looks like there is vomit on the right side and brownies or chocolates thrown on the ground. The part I don't like the most is the picture of the woman in the reflection of the sunglasses. </FONT>

<P><FONT size=4>2) <FONT color=#993399>What audience </FONT>is the text intended to reach? <EM>Are you part of</EM> that audience? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>3) How would you phrase in words the image's appeal to its audience?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=5>My ad is about Flonase (Fluticasone propionate). It is attempting to appeal to middle aged people who want to remain healthy and fit. It does intend to make me a part of the audience because it says that it relieves neezy, itchy, stuffy, and runny noses and a lot of people, including me have those problems at least once in their life. The logos or the quality of the text are that&nbsp; most of the postive things about the product are in a bigger font and/or bold. The risks are ina smaller font and on the back of the advertisement. This ad appeals to the audiences emotion because it makes you feel like you are just like her and that the medicine can fix all of your problems just like all of the women's problems are gone now. </FONT></P>"

"event","<P>As a topic for next week's post, I would suggest the following: <U>write about the visual aspects of something which is entirely ordinary</U>. We have all experienced the visual sublime, e.g., our first view of the Grand Canyon, the Eiffel Tower in the Paris landscape, or film representations of the visual sublime (Julia Roberts in <I>Pretty Woman</I> transformed from street walker to Richard Gere's consort). But most of our visual experience is built on the ordinary--functional building facades, ordinary automobiles, <A onmouseover=""window.status='clip art'; return true;"" style=""BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none"" onmouseout=""window.status=''; return true;"" href=""http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=24&amp;k=clip%20art"">clip art</A>.

<P><FONT color=#000099><FONT size=4>I want to write about the Saginaw Valley State University Library. I never really have payed too much attention at the beauty of the architecture. The entrance is nothing special because it is also an entrance to the Science East building. The fourth floor to the library is the most striking to me because it is very nice to have the big windows to look out on the whole campus. The rest of the building is like a regular library because that is what the University wanted; a quiet, old, peaceful atmosphere to accomplish piles of homework on a weekly basis. I have been in other campus' libraries which were very new and hi-tech in all aspects. It is nice to have technology, but you also need areas of the library where there is nothing around to steal your attention and time. I hope this what you were looking for when you asked us to write about this topic.</FONT> </FONT></P>"

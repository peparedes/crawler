"event","so today i was watching a walk to remember, I know the movie is a little cheezy but all and all has a pretty beautiful message.  unlikely though that i ever see or read anything that i then don't take to heart and interpret my life through.  I realized that what really scares me about my condition isn't that it's deadly or that my body is physically sick, is that, that i'll have to live a long healthy life struggling through everyday.  it's hard for me to talk about these things especially because people don't really understand, i mean i can't really blame anyone for that, you can't understand an experience like mine if you don't have it as well.  But it does affect everything, my interactions with people, my self esteem in certain situations, my will and ambition and mostly my heartache.  It so pathetic to wallow in self pity and although i feel like i'm slowly taking the first step to coming to terms with the fact this is something i'll always have to live with and will limit my engagement in certain things, but its just so emotional.  There's nothing scarier than being blind, and thinking that any day my condition could change and I could wake up in blackness paralyzes me. Knowing that i've lived my life enjoying as much as i can and having people that support me comforts me, but not knowing if i'll be ok, not knowing if when i have a family i can take care of my kids, not knowing if i'll be able to excel in my career.  Everyone fears the unknown and no man is an island, people suffer much more throughout the world than i could possibly imagine, its just sometimes its hard to bare.  My sadness becomes just a great anger towards God, anger and resentment to my friends, which is awful, because they are the people i love the most, my family, the people who i grew up with and have shaped and supported all my dreams.  Its having ups and downs, days where i'm happy, greatful, inspired and days when everything just seems to hard to deal with. I'm thankful to always want more, to have drive although at times misguided, it gives me hope and my friends support me with that drive, they inspire me everyday, meeting people who have overcome adversity, or who have so much to give, these are the people who i hope to learn from and who have given me so much, i can only hope to return the favor to them someday.  I want to inspire and change someone's life, if i do that i've accomplished the best things someone can hope for.  I hope to keep writting at least once a week, it helps and teaches me a little more about myself everyday, this is a time in my life where i'm trying to figure out what i want from my experiences, who i want to be, my likes and dislikes, my personal style, my view on the world. It all seems to be moving and I feel i've grown alot over the past few years and there is nowhere to go but up."

Have started a new outlook on life, new and strengthened resolve and stamina.  Will get that rock hard body before I get back to the 'ford, will get very tan, will let my hair grow longer, will be more understanding to others opinions.. on that note will listen more and talk less.  I miss my Tok, I hope she's well, I'm always right next to you (mind and spirit) and can't wait for our new adventures next year.  Playing around with my new MacBook alot.. trying to figure out how most of the things work.  Finally put all my contacts and schedules into the computer and therefore onto my Ipod, hoping for a more organized year. That's all for now."

Streams

Standing on the fire escape,
rain soaking my skin,
""Testosterone boys and Harlequin girls"",
blood rush, cold and peace,
anticipation,
""boys will be boys baby...""
come find me,
kiss me in this storm,
wrap me in your dry dark blankets,
embrace me as I stand,
in this nature and extasy.
Tender flesh ticled by your lashes,
fluttering thoughts,
flashes of memories,
flirting with desire,
pleasure and lust remixed.
Consumed by the rain beating on the window,
beating on my skin,
flooding past my eyes, past my lips, past my collarbone, past my belly button, past my knees, past my ankles,
carresing every curve and crevice,
flooding through the grates of the fire escape.
Centered and isolated as the world spins around me,
his rough hands squeeze my hair,
liquid gardenias.
My body in his clothes pressed
against his body with no clothes,
so firm, so warm, dry.
Dry fabric, dewy, supple skin,
dripping...
Soft short kisses on my back,
willing submission,
rapture.
subsequent silent streams graze my cheekbones,
this may be the last time I feel this way with him,
drops on the pillowcase,
eyes shut as the aurora aprooaches and the realizaion of reality sets in..."

"event","So alot has changed since the last entry.  Me and Anina have set out to resolve our differences, it's not gonna be easy or immediate but at least we've both made a resolution to work at it.  I realized one of the things i like most about college is how you make friends with who you want and no one judges you for not being friends with certain people.  There's no need to be friends with everyone, as long as you're nice to all and honest to the everyone (not being a hipocrite is imortant). It's weird how I feel like I'm finally taking time out of my life to focus on myself, do things I love, writting again, reading, craft projects etc.  and people just are giving me shit about it, being like "" why aren't you going out anymore"" not only my friends but my mother too.. it's so stupid.  Why should i need an excuse to NOT go out.. it's supposed to be the opposite, and it's not like i'm not going out on weekends and stuff it's just while i'm working during the week, i like to get a good nights sleep and relax, not being out 'till five so i can wake up at 8 and sit in my cubicle for eight hours.  They've finally found a clinical explanation for my constant tiredness and need for sleep, my Thyroid count has become increasingly high and fluctuating and therefore, i will probably start on medication soon, but hopefully it'll give the bounce back in my step and help with my constant diziness and ear pains.  Everything else is going well, my close friends are well in touch and we talk or see each other often and pleasantly  I'm very happy for this summer, to recuperate and relax and find myself a little more everyday, returning to college with a renewed sense of self and purpouse and accomplishment.  My first real article is being published on Monday in the newspaper and I'm really excited my stern boss thought my work was really good, it's one thing to hear it from teachers and friends, but when a profesional tells you, you're a good writer it really makes me feel good about my accomplishments. Am now going to watch Briget Jones diary.. I hope to one day keep a diary as compeling as hers, I just need to polish up my style a little, the content is all there though, lol, will never end up like her hopefully, actually will do all possible to never NEAR being that miserable and shallow.  That's all for now...."

"event","It is so weird to think that I'm already back home and my freshman year is over.  It was a pretty cool year and i don't regret a moment, there were a few bumps along the road but I wouldn't do it any other way.  So I came home to beautiful Puerto Rico, rested for a week then spent a week in Culebra, an island off the coast, with ten of my close friends.    We spend the entire week drunk on the beach, made some hash brownies, went skinny dipping in a deserted beach, the world was our paradise.  Now I am very tan and very relaxed, got some of the pent of craziness out of my system. But it wasn't two seconds 'till the drama between my friends started.  One of the girls on the group reads tarot cards, and she read my future to be involved with my best friends having a huge fight in five weeks, and although it woun't have anything to do with me but I won't be able to do anything to fix it. Story of my life, being the mediator in all these silly fights.  But really life wouldn't be the same without the drama, it'd definetely not be as interesting but I'd like to keep my peace of mind when I'm sober.  Me and Anina were all cooluntil I realized that she hadn't changed at all, shes still that awful shallow sadistic person.  The Marissa, to my Summer, as Marissa died on the finale of the OC so has our friendship evolved.. we're moving in two different directions and I feel like my best friend, the one I grew up with is so far lost within this 'new sparkly college chick' that I don't know if I can get her back or if she wants to be brought back.  I miss my 'Fords Joe, Angie, Sarah, Liz, Brian and the whole gang, I love being home and being with my 'family' the friends i've known since I was 5, the people who have been there for me and who I've been with through thin and thick, but it's a really different hang than that which I have with my new friends the ones who don't love me just because we've known each other forever and family is not something you ever stop loving, but the new people who are my friends based on interests and shared expereince.  It's prettty cool to have two homes and two gropus of friends, a life with dual purpouse, it gives me hope than when things get shitty here there's always people over there for me and vice versa.  I miss Chase alot, but I doubt he thinks of me at all, some boys never grow up, never comitt and I guess I'm ok with that now, I have my own issues, but it's nice to be liked and I miss that mutual care between two people, the things I felt with old friends I dated and my best friends who I'll never know what the future will bring with them.  Well now i'm going to my friend Laura's for a sex in the city night.. I miss these girl's nights I hope someday my haverford girls will be enthused about these long held traditions I cherish so dearly.  TTFN."

"event","As we grow up, we learn that even the one person that wasn't supposed to ever let you down probably will. You will have your heart broken, probably more than once, and it's harder every time. You'll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was broken. You'll fight with your best friend.
You'll blame a new love for things an old one did. You'll cry
because time is passing too fast, and you'll eventually lose someone you love. So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you've never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness you'll never get back. 
Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot; who calls you
back when you hang up on him; who will stay awake just to watch you sleep. Wait for the guy who kisses your forehead; who wants to show you off to the world when you are in your sweats; who holds your hand in front of his friends. Wait for the one who's constantly reminding you of how much he cares about you and how lucky he is to have you. Wait for the one who turns to his friends and says, ""..that's her."""

I wonder why this constantly happens and why it usually relates to boys. Unclear and confusing boys, along with cool relaxed ones that you just want to chill with but they automatically thin i'm into them. I think I may really like this guy, someone i had never seen in this light and now am starting to spark curiousity towards. He's really sweet and caring but his intentions are very unclear, I sish he'd just let me know if he just wants to be friends with benefits, or something more, or nothing at all, 'cuz tugging my emotions/mind everywhere is not helping me focus on studying very much. Things are going good with my guy friends here, for the most part we are bonding more and i'm gonna misss them tons when i go home, but then i'll have hector and the ignacio's and all the boys I love and that shower me with affection which I miss desperately. It'll be weird coming home after all this time, I feel i've changed alot, in a good way, but in a way where i won't fit into the norms of what my friends and I were into in high school. I'm tired of the insance partying, the hook ups, and all the radomniss of my past life, i just want, peace quiet and comfort.  We'll see how that goes I'm optomistic though, and I hope to keep in touch with the people here at HC and keep all my friendships strong."

I was pleasently suprised by someone and had a good night... jeje.  Things seem to finally be adding up, classes and modd swings are pretty under control and for the most part I now know who my real friends are.  I feel bad for my best friends elsewhere who are all going through seeming crisises over their significant other and I cant be ther for thme.

How did we grow up so fast? It was so nice when we were little kids, playing having fun, unconcered with worldy issues, dbeing daily suprised and mazed by the itttle things this world haas to offer us.  Not worried about the future, about the worlds conflicts, about tpeople or societies opinions.  Things were simple and uncorrupted then.

His honesty andrespect impressed me.  There's only a week left in school, so it's hard to think to start a relationship with anyone, and I definetely have no idea of what he thinks of me, if he even is attracted to me.  Work is getting hectic as finals approach. Housing is driving me crazy since I am now placed in Comfort 4th where I very well know I can't live because of my visual disability, but the Dean is not being so cooperative, I don't really know what to do, and my parent's are on my back, I understand they're looking out for my safety and my well being but I must insist I'm doing everything possible to be on top of things.  I had a huge fight with a hallmate last week, snapping at her, due to these tensions of struggling once again with my vision.  On a brighter note Michelle, Joese, Adyan, J'andres and his two roommates came over this weekend for spring fling and La Fiesta, we had an awesome time.. but now I am totally exhausted and almost fell asleep at the PAF retreat.  I'm really happy I'm doing PAF I think I can really make a difference in people's lives and also learn alot about myself and just basic skills of how to talk to others and improve on communication and socializing.  I quit smoking.. for good now.  I'm trying to live a healthier lifestyle and am taking it little by little, but I'm glad my friends here at the 'Ford are here to support me and I hope to survive the summer in good condition.

"event","This is one of my new favorite poems I just discovered, I'm putting it up for your enjoyment and inspiration. 

""The Idea Of Order At Key West""
   ~Wallace Stevens

She sang beyond the genius of the sea.
The water never formed to mind or voice,
Like a body wholly body, fluttering
Its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion
Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry,
That was not ours although we understood,
Inhuman, of the veritable ocean.

The sea was not a mask. No more was she.
The song and water were not medleyed sound
Even if what she sang was what she heard,
Since what she sang was uttered word by word.
It may be that in all her phrases stirred
The grinding water and the gasping wind;
But it was she and not the sea we heard.

For she was the maker of the song she sang.
The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea
Was merely a place by which she walked to sing.
Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew
It was the spirit that we sought and knew
That we should ask this often as she sang.

If it was only the dark voice of the sea
That rose, or even colored by many waves;
If it was only the outer voice of sky
And cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,
However clear, it would have been deep air,
The heaving speech of air, a summer sound
Repeated in a summer without end
And sound alone. But it was more than that,
More even than her voice, and ours, among
The meaningless plungings of water and the wind,
Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped
On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres
Of sky and sea.
It was her voice that made
The sky acutest at its vanishing.
She measured to the hour its solitude.
She was the single artificer of the world
In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,
Whatever self it had, became the self
That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,
As we beheld her striding there alone,
Knew that there was never a world for her
Except the one she sang and, singing, made.

Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,
Why, when the singing ended and we turned
Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights,
The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,
As the night descended, tilting in the air,
Mastered the night and portioned out the sea,
Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,
Arranging, deepening, enchanting night.

Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,
The maker's rage to order words of sea
Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,
And of ourselves and our origins,
In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds."

"event","Things seem to be good with my friends from home.. but things at haverford don't seem to be at the same level of balance.  I've upset a good friend, possibly to someday be my best friend and I don't think it was just this one instance that upset her and possibly something about me has been bothering her for a while.  Maybe I don't have my priorities straight, maybe I should dedicate myself more to things/maybe i'm spreading myself to thin.  I'm unsure of my inadequacies although I'm sure there are multiple ones .. i'm nothing but human.  It seems like the bonds that have ""grown stronger"" wer just bent drastically in a week, with a few people.  Some feeling I've distanced myself from them, and others we spend too much time together.  3I'm not certain that my actions have offended anyone directly or that my demeanor is somewhat different towards people.  It's one of those days you wake up and everything just feels weird.. you can't really pinpoint why or how to get out of it, problem is it's lasted 4 days.  There's a need for me to redeem my qualities with someone and to be strong and independant.  It's hard with my visual condition doing so.. I can't really afford to be alone very much and when I am alone in my room(the one place of ""peace"")  people think I'm having a tantrum or that I'm being lazy and watching a movie. Can I blame them? that's probably the aura I give off, unfortunately little people know that really when I say I'm sleeping I'm usually laying around reading or writting, it's the only escape without sounding bitchy or rude or lazy or stupid. although stereotypes will always form and assumptions will always be made about how people spend their time.   It's like there's no appropriate fit, and I enjoy it mostly, having fun, being loud, and sometimes just relaxing but things are always read into what you do.  I know this guy he's really cool and we talked for a while today , how much I would like to just have fun with a boy on weekends and then hang out with them in a chill way during the week.  Why do most people I know at haverford feel like if you hook up with them then if they're nice to you, you'll think they like you.  Why can't it just be like friends who get along, chill, hang out and then sometimes hook up.  Friends with benefits has completely been erased at the 'ford. In part understandibly, because people don't want to deal with putting in the effort or emotional investment and often one of the two falls for the other and things get weird. I guess I've always had good luck with this, and all the instances when this happened I ended up with two best friends, and all the others we still hang out and things are never uncomfortable, I feel like it works towards the reverse because it just makes things more comfortable.  Yeah we've hooked up, been intimate, talked and know about each others lives, it's just really easygoing, but alot of people i know don't seem to understand how this works.  It's sad becasue there's definetely boys I've hooked up with at Haverford are cool boys and even though I don't feel like I want to hook up with them again, they seem like good people I'd like to be friends with.  It's just weird, I'm not angry or upset, it's all just been crossing my mind. I was talking to Joe the other day and we discussed how haverford parties were basically like mating rituals, guys macking on girls seeing if they can hook up with them, little conversation or dancing, just flirting which is all good and fun, anc I can't say I haven't taken part in this, but it just gets old and boring fast.  Don't get me wrong I definetely enoy and relish in the random hook up but my party girl days are winding down and it would be nice to have something more stable, not necessarily a boyfriend.. I dunno even a ""fuckbuddy"" would be more stable than what I've been experiencing lately.  What scares me is i don't know what I want or how or with who. Now i'm just ranting. So i'm gonna cut it here. I just really hope that I figure things out soon."

"event","Well I had my first PAF training which was really fun, I think I'm gonna meet alot of new people and have fun. Things are good with me and Anina now which makes me really happy b/c I didn't want some time and space keep us apart.  Two new boys in the spectrum Eddie and Tristan both really cute and sweet people, we'll see what the outcome of this is.  I'm going to Yale next weekend to visit Tasher and Hector, which should be a good time, I miss them tons.  Michelle is coming down for Spring Fling which will be pretty SWEET, she can relish in my awesome housing arrangement before I have to move in to bad sophmore housing.  Housing.. that's another thing on my mind. Where to live"" With who"" Unless we get a rising Junior to live with us we're pretty much screwed for housing, but we're working on it, I'll find out in two weeks.   First big rain of the season happened yesterday, pretty eventful, we played fuck the dealer and kings, and basically ran all over campus with the rain, singing ""everytime we touch"" and being rowdy and crazy and drunk in all senses of the words.  I miss these weekends of crazyness, hopefullly the tradition will be continued, we still have three and a half cases of beer so that'll last us for a good amount of time.  That's all for now, i should get to work.  The rain in literature and movies usually symbolizes the cleansing and blurring of the past, maybe it's time to put old experiences behind and start on new things.  ""Start everyday as if it was on purpouse"" is my new motto."

"event","Well I stayed up until 5 am last night with Angie, reading Shadows of War and making Valentine's day heart shaped letters and goodie bags for all the people on my hall. Writting Sem was cancelled this morning so I slept a little more Ttohe rest of my day weird.. as valentine's usually are, I reflect on my past relationships, on my friends and theirs.  It's weird to feel so helpless about everything going on.. my cards are all out on the table waiting to be contested by the other players. Did any of them ever love me? did they want me for my body? why were most of them one night stands? why did my boyfriend say our relationship was purely physical when I was so emotionally invested in it? is my personality so horrible that guys are willing to hook up with me but never date me or even stay the entire night?  Adyan says that someday i'll find a guy that deserves me and he'll be amazing but why do i have to sit around while all the people around me are paring up? Grey sees me as his little sister.. I thought i could deal with it, but just like in grey's anatomy ""i remeber the last time we kissed, it was a thursday, you were wearing that torn shirt which you look so good in, your hair smelled like some flower, you put your hand on my chest and kissed me, briefly, softly, like we were used to it, like we'd be doing it for the rest of our lives"" - Dr. McDreamy. he makes me feel safe.. something i desperately need when i'm having all this happen in my life. I doubt every day my relationships with old friends and new ones.. it's all out of my control. out of my hands. i feel so dissasociated with my own life, like ti's living itself out and i'm just watching it go by.. it's Really scary to me.what am I do where am I going? and who will journey with me ? who will endure the voyage? are they from my past or in my future? happy valentine's day. que el amor que transita dentro de mi algun dia sangre en las manos de alguien que me cosera y me acompa~e en el hospital, blanco e impersonal, grande e indefinido."

"event","With the first snow came the first shock of reality.. from my drunken friday where I could barely get up 'till five pm. the next day untill my first Quaker meeting experience life was well.. eventfull.  It's crazy to think how one amazing weekend came to one full of dissapointments and realizations.  There is at least two feet of snow outside.. beautifull pllush.. we ran around in the blizzard a little last night.. today was plenary which is always fun but long.. it all gave me time to think about everything, weird how nature, snow and quakerism bring this out of me, something rarely evoked by baldwin, hipocrisy and superficiality, city lights and sounds and my parent's thunderous voice and omnious presence. Anyways back to the point I went on a walk with lily and later with allyn, evan and sarah, we were quiet alot, something that nice.. except when I'm alone in my room at nite.. but it did make me realize alot, contemplate on my current situation. Realizing that I don't have a future with any of the boys i was after. Grey likes this other girl, Maddona is totally ignoring me and Athena is acting all weird around me, Oscar is out of the picture and Jeter... hmm don't know about him, but I also don't really know him, but we'll see. it's highly doubtfull.. I don't really know what I""m doing.. I need to concentrate more on school work but I can't help this feeling.  Today at meeting no one really talked for at least 45 minutes which gave me all this time to think.. not just replay things in my mind but really analyze them, release them, solve them.  ""normal is a place I visit"" this is an interesting concept because it's true, where is normal? is it happy, is it sad, is it extasy, is it pain? is it walking through the snow, or laying on the dewy grass? or is it laying on the beach alone, watching the waves crash in front of me? is it drunkedness or sobriety, is it sex or abstinence? is it love or loss? This is hopefully the start of a new poem and a new promise.  To upkeep myself, I smoked my last pack of cigarettes, i'm cutting down on coffee and drinking, working out more and eating healthier, I need to get out of this rut.. this anger towards an old friend who dosen't seem to appreciate or respect me which is highly offensive to me and seemingly unimportant to her.  My best friend thinks i'm going crazy and is mad worried about me.. I would be to.. but things are gonna change, I have my friends here at the 'ford pushing me along to be better.. keep me on my toes.. I'm reading ""the Hours"" now.. I feel it is helpfull like everything Hoho asigns it's theraputic.. like quaker meeting.. like writting.. like music.  I need to be more involved.. and self involved.. I need my time of reflection my world of fantasy apart from  my reality which now seems to jumble.  I was talking to brian and joe tonite.. realizing that it was a competition life is competition... sam in my sociology class said that haverford foster mediocrity b/c there is no competitve edge to strive for excellence, but I fight for Grey... I fight for proffesors approval at excelling.. not in spitefull terms but b/c i'm determined, b/c untill i don't achieve things I won't feel like i can.. I was also thinking about customs comittee.. and how I might pass them by in the DC or something.. they might think me rude not saying hi to them.. but I can't see them.. the peripheral vision lacking makes it really difficult even to find people I am looking for.. should i feel guilty for not telling them of my visual disability?? would it impair my ability to be a good customs person? if chosen, would the customs comittee feel like they maybe made a wrong decision and should they have known chosen someone else?? just stuff on my mind.. weird and incoerent.. b/c normal is a place I visit.. and not very regularly.."

"event","this weekend has been crazy~! my entire semester of uneventful love life experiences exploded over a two nite weekend. found out some new boys were interested in me, some old ones rekindled and some known one's brought to light.  I don't know if this makes any sense but as time passes my affection for one of these grows stronger, although our efforts stifled by certain preconcieved notions...I can still cut the tension with a knife.  You know those moments when you just want to lean in and kiss someone, make everything better.. encapsulate every emotion in your body in a single instant, the problem is the fears of not have it reciprocated.  It's hard not being honest, not taking chances.. i have my entire life, they haven't turned out well mostly but the one's that have were amazing and the one's that didn't made me the person I am today and i think that's a pretty good person to be.  I've embraced my way of being.. my drinking and smoking brought out.. i'm not scared of what other's think about it anymmore.. it's part of who i am.. and once again i need to reafirm who that is.  we'll see what this new semster turns out like.. but for now i'm optomistic as always, but i don't think i could handle too many more weekends this intense unless i have an inmense amount of Marb Lights and tons of liquor to help me deal with it.  customs apps are in and hopefully we'll see them turn out right, we'll know at ends of february.. hopefully good news to take home for spring break. my best friend and her boyfriend are doing well i'm happy for her.. but unsure of my own stability in relationships with boys.  i have two boys i believe will be my good friends throughout college, but apart from that all the romantic interludes with men at haverford are up in the air.. confusing and at times frustrating. Is there any way to stay grounded in a frazzled emotional state?"

It's been an amazing experience, I never thought this time would come, a time of freedom and calm, it's had it's rough spots, but i'm not looking forward to going home to the drama and the craziness, being here was doing what i wanted, learning about life and people and the subjects that really intrigued me, it's been a time of peace and at times painfull quiet, although I miss my best friends at home and the beach, I'm going to greatly miss all my good friends here and my room and those people who have inspired me to be better, truer to myself.  Although I haven't written much over the semsester I feel I've found people to confide in here that have given me almost as much relief as writting in my journal had at home.  I left my island, leaving behind the lies, the hipocrites, the snobs, the betrayal, the tears and the laughter.  I'm not as cold as I was there, misunderstood by the one's around me, I'll miss the quiet..."

"event","LOST

A woman sits alone on a shore,
Silhouette caressed by the silky hands of the west wind,
Having no concept of Time,
Unaware of any other reality than her own.

Sitting there,
Watching as the waves wash away her worries and consciousness,
No past or future,
Just the contemplation of her present solitude,
Confined to the limits of her flesh bound mind.

She wanders forever, 
Not moving an inch, 
Silent.
She watches as the ruby in the sky plunges into the navy deep,
Envying it, 
Wanting to be extinguished by the powerful jade and sapphire liquor,
Knowing nothing of life, 
She is lost,
Her waterfalls fill the ocean which she now reflects upon.

Why is she there?
Alone.
A single soul,
A broken heart,
A last breath,
A sinking surreal memory,
A silent shore broken by the whispers of the waves that wash away a life,

No one was there to witness it, 
She was lost,
Forgotten by society,
Only understood by the sand, 
By the sun, 
By the sea.

She rests in peace now,
In the most beautiful way,
Returning to her unrequited love,
The one who never abandoned her."

"event","everything's going crazy.. life spiraling.. i haven't written a single thing in my first semeser of college, numb of feeling or thought, i feel hopelessly lost. although i'm surrounded by love and support it's hard to feel anything real.  reality seems to cease itself and turn itself into a reacuring dream.. not a good one, just like life, just with a feeling of being dazed.. automatically going through the motions of each day. i don't understand what's wrong, maybe i just need to take time and go back to the warmth of the tropics.. clean myself of the city in the pristine ocean..
I feel much better thanks to my dear friend slav and lily and angie and hector.. thankx guys for listen to me complain and rant... ur the best.."

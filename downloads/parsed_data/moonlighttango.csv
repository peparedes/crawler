recently ive been really lost. its not the i dont know where i am type lost its the i dont know what i want type. its been driving me crazy. i see all these cute couples in the hallway, on tv, at the mall anywhere, and im like i want that. i make myself think that its exactly what i want. a relationship and a serious one. and then the second i get close to it, i get scared and i back out. i dont know why but with the past 4 relation ships ive had its been a 2 month limit. when i hit the 2 month i get all freaked out and i run, well not really run more of a im gonna ignore you so lets break up kind of run. so i decided to take a break with relationships and jus hook up and have fun. and it is fun.. for the first liek month. then i get that omg i want a bf feeling again. ugh. i cant even live with myself. i mean yea its fun to play and all but i want something more.. yet im really not ready for that. split personalities? maybe idk, but what ever it is its going to devour me and i cant handle it. sometimes i just get the feeling that i want to leave. go to idk.. anywhere but the place im in. just for a day or two. and maybe i will. someday very soon.

so much trash
no one to take it out.
im so sick of this whole highschool rollercoaster thing. one minute you feel liek you couldnt be higher, and your so happy, and then someone says soemthing so stupid, and there you are, on the ground. not even the ground. your so far down, your 6 feet under. its liek people these days think that they can say whatever they want and no one will care. ive seen it way too much. ive also seen the people go crazy. liek this boy i know. he was jumped and all because of a stupid team rivalry. apparently they remembered him, say him, and beat him as if he really deserved it. one minute hes star lax player. the next, hes in the hospital with a meatal cheekbone and a purple face. everyone talks i no, ive seen, but next time you do, think about it. it effects people and some people are willing to to go crazy on you. im not gonna listen to it anymore. i dont care what you think about me because none of you know me. not really. take it into consideration, because the first time you get a cheap laugh from your friend to bring some poor kid down, could be your last. and i hope that it will be. i say that with harshness but i mean it with care.

going away this weekend was amazing. i got to get away from everything(plus i got to live in an RV how incredible awesome is that!).. school, parents, drama, and even little things like tv and computers. to tell you the truth it felt great. i got to focus on something that i really feel liek i havent been able to truly focus on in a while and thats God. i learned so much about him and myself and the kind of person im going to be, its amazing. i got to really get to know some of the people at my church that ive seen or talked to or jus sed hey, but never really knew. which brings me to my next point.. i have to start getting to know some of the people at school that i say hi to or have met because they turn out to be so incredibly awesome. i think everyone wheather your christian athieast jewish what ever needs to take a weekend and jus chillax and focus on other things than looking good or being cool or even making good  impressions, because you know what it really doesnt matter and if your putting those things first in your life than your not living for you .. your living for them.. and thats not good. so think about that or dont its really up to you but if u feel like your trapt in a room thats not the one you want to be in .. talk to someone. you might see that they can help you u n l o c k the d o o r.

i had an amazing weekend its insane. i went on retreat to ocean city with my churches middle schoolers. we went to alive, its a youth conference and i learned so much, not only about god but about myself and the other people of my church. it turns out there are so many kids at my church that are so awesome and obviously share the same belifs and dude they jus rock my world. but the most important thing i learned was about hanging on the edge. what does that mean ur prolly thinkning. basically it means dont stay on the safe side all of your life. go for what you want todo, god loves you just as you are, and where your at. hang on the edge instead of leaving yourself camped out on some nountain, take the risk, it will work out for the better. this doesnt only apply to god. if your having a problem with parents a friend or any thing hang on the edge. if theres something in your life you feel you need to change, HANG ON THE EDGE. because the only way you can be pulled up from that edge id by facing and getting through what ever you need to. its so much better to live life like knowing you not afraid to be you or not afraid of not fitting in, knowing that you can do what you wanna and smiling as you do it. who cares what other people think, its not up to them and hey if they like you they like you if they dont they dont, its their decion take it or leave it, but you shouldnt be the one going to them and changing who you are because then your camping out. putting yourself in a tent, locked up. forget that. its ridic. scream if you wanna scream. dance if you waanna dance.

    life isnt perfect. if these things didnt exist, everything would be perfect. perfect hair. perfect guy. perfect family. perfect life. perfect day . perfect everything. but its not like that and it cant be. everything would come easy and love would never die and the world would never fight, and there would be the perfect amount of time in a day. nothing comes easy, love will die, the world will always fight and theres never enough time in a day but all for a good reason. we have to work for the things we get and we have to keep everything inline.
the petty problems we face are nothing compared to others. theres people in this world who we cant even compare to. the most irritating thing i think ive ever heard is britney spears' new song about how hard it is to be a celebrity and although it might be stressful and she may fight with her boyfriend, she has no idea whut its like to be starving.. dying.. sick.. homeless.. lifeless.. and beaten. she may go through some hard times but on the average, she has everyone doing everything for her. all she has to do is ""sit there and look pretty"". it makes me so mad that she thinks she knows it all and she doesnt. shes no better than anyone else and no one is better than her. but you can be different then her. if you take your life and you see it as yours.. something that belongs to you, think agian. this life is a gift .. figure out how you can give that gift in return.

"event","""Katrina"" as an excuse for anything and everything.  I am SO fucking tired of hearing about ""Kateriner"" and ""da storum"" whenever someone doesn't want to take the time to fill out a form or look through a book.  When I worked at a hotel, I met people from Indonesia who lived through Katrina times three and they still managed to say ""Please"" and ""Thank you"".  And they were COLORED and everything!  Living through a disaster (which wouldn't have occurred if you had studied geographic data and probability beforehand) does not earn you The Biggest Asshole in the World free pass.  Shut up and take care of yourself for once in your life.

""Market failures"".  This is often cited as a rationale for government intervention to salvage lost causes like Bear Sterns and the subprime subhumans.  Markets don't fail, but flourishing markets allow failing businesses to fail.  Otherwise, they are rescued, resources are wasted and no one learns anything.  It's kind of like forgiving a continually-fucking-up alcoholic and then being surprised that she continues to fuck up.  Oh, wait...

""Think outside the box"" (general working environments) and ""2.0"" (libraries specifically).  Neither of these terms means ANYTHING.  By definition, any concept created in your workspace is INSIDE the BOX.  Granted, I've had some at-the-time-revelatory ideas while tripping on LSD in my bedroom, but most of my work suggestions have arisen from meetings and traditional office powwows.  As for ""2.0"", youngish librarians have started appending it to EVERY activity in the hopes that it'll make them relevant.  Uploading photos to Flickr or editing Wikipedia is something that my grandma could do if she so chose, so claiming that as some badge of cutting-edge honor is a bit of a wash.

The only cure for cancer is living human flesh. A group of rich people with cancer put together a lottery and only allow derelicts and miscreants to buy tickets. They assemble a group of ""winners"", who are secretly injected with tranquilizers. Moms and dads encourage their St. Jude kids to ""eat the bad people"", old men with advanced lung cancer gobble up methhead flesh. But, in the course of the evening, it's revealed that one of the ""cancer victims"" is not a cancer victim and has perpetrated a fraud to fulfill his fantasy of cannibalism."

For one thing, the elementary school where I vote wasn't giving out cookies and American flag stickers to bribe folks to show up.  For the first time I can remember, it was packed...and I was the youngest person there!  A mere slip of a boy with my naive Libertarian ideals...

Jim Newberry kicked the living hell out of the fullback-esque incumbent mayor, Teresa Isaac.  Ms. Isaac's strategy of insisting that she had never made a mistake during her term, a term that saw two women drown because Lexington's sewers won't drain, was ineffective.

The voters voted to disallow city condemnation of the water company.  My arguments that Lexington could drown many more people if they had a whole water company seem to have worked.

The guy who favors vouchers made it onto my local school board.

Nationally, it was a lot more hit and miss.  I'm happy that the Republicans got smacked, but hopefully the Dems won't see this as some kind of display of affection for them.  This was a protest vote against an incompetent administration that has made colossal errors and generated tremendous waste.  In wrestling terms, the Reps are the Iron Sheik and the Dems are Bob Backlund--it's not so much that folks love and want Backlund, it's that they hate the Sheik and will cheer anybody who can beat him.

I was also saddened by the gay marriage bans.  Put up an amendment to ban marriage altogether and I'll vote for it, but singling out a certain kind of couple for exclusion is revoltin'.

The interview segments and the judging are neato in that reality-TV, obviously-worked-for-the-camera way.  I love how they're trying to make WCW superstar Master P this loveable rebel character.  This is a man who put out rap songs with step-by-step instructions on how to make crack.  What a great goy.  The best part happened when Master P was being judged.  He wears Air Force Ones or some shit instead of ballroom dancing shoes and the British judge was like, ""You play basketball, right?"" (I don't know if he thought that P is primarily a basketball player or if he was suggesting that, because he's a nigger, of course he plays basketball, they all do)  ""Would you wear ballroom shoes on the basketball court?  No?  OK then!""  They should make him say racist/abusive things to everybody, it would make DWTS 100 times better.  ""Well, Mario Lopez, you were moving so quickly out there, one would have thought the INS was after you!  I'll bet you wish you were selling tacos back at the stand in Tijuana now, eh?""  Apart from that, Tatum O'Neil looks coked-out and ready to break at any moment.  Stacy Keibler seems as personable as I've always heard, even if she is blonde.  Jerry Rice looks like a sweaty store mannequin.  Big black guys who fake-smile all the time are like the creepiest thing ever.  Anyway, apart from the dancing, it's probably worth watching once.  I've decided that, between wrestling, roller derby, and this, sports entertainment is probably my favorite TV genre ever.

My Dad and I were going to watch wrestling, but wrestling promoters are even more irresponsible than punk rockers and metalheads, so it fell through.  I was really looking forward to watching a show with real marks instead of clappy-chanty smarks, but oh well.  So we went to eat Mexican food and my Dad complained about my brother and told me that he was going to take his car away since he's not working.  Then we went to the Bottleneck Blues Bar and listened to some band play the blues while constantly smiling.  Tourist crap.  
While I was sick on Indian food and Italian beer, Jimmy decided that since he's 30, it's time to start wearing a leather jacket in the fashion of DEATH WISH-era Charles Bronson and just be as much of a jerk as possible.

I think that's everything.  On the way home, I listened to Coast to Coast AM, which used to be hosted by Art Bell until he snapped.  I learned that giants are cannibals who once ruled the Earth until God struck them down with lightning.  The new host declared that this also makes scientific sense because giants, being taller than other people, are more likely to attract lightning, just like trees do.  I also learned that giants built the pyramids through telekinetic powers in their nasal passages.  There was no appeal to science for that one."

Rid the World of Fad Diets and Gimmicks Day-January 18-""spotlights the widespread fraud and quackery in the weight loss field.""

Setsubun-February 3-Marks the beginning of Spring in Japan, celebrated by throwing beans out of the house while crying, ""Oni wa soto, fuku wa uchi!""

Charles Dickens Day-February 7-Dress in Victorian costume.  Prepare food from Dickens's era. Read a book or something!

National Pecan Day-April 14-Eat 'em, they're good.

Greenery Day-April 29-A day for friendship with nature and gratitude for its blessings.

Walpurgis Night-April 30-Pagan holiday on which mead or sparkling wine is consumed.  Greens and branches from the forest are collected at twilight and houses are adorned with them.  In exchange, homeowners give adorners rewards of several eggs.  There is also an American Satanic variant.

Dutch Remembrance of the Dead-May 4-At 8 PM, 2 minutes of silence are observed for the dead of World War 2.

Yellow Pig's Day-May 17-Mathematical holiday.  Celebrates yellow pigs and the number 17.  Yellow pig carols are sung, yellow pig cake is eaten, and tales of the number 17 are told.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Pig%27s_Day

Festival of Popular Delusions-June 5-""This was originally a German holiday that began in 1945, the year after D-Day. Before that turning point in the Nazis' plan for world domination, the popular delusion was world domination.""  Psychics, pet psychics, the DaVinci Code, raw foods, breast enlargement pills, there are so many choices!

Ivan Kupala Day-June 23-Pagan holiday.  Girls float flower garlands down rivers and derive fortunes from them.  Lads and girls jump over bonfires.

Marine Day-Third Monday in July-A day of gratitude for the blessings of the ocean.  Douse people with water, there's plenty to go around!

Respect for the Aged Day-Third Monday in September-Self explanatory.

Health and Sports Day-Second Monday in October-A day for enjoying sports and cultivating a healthy mind and body.

Dia de los Muertos-November 2-Honor dead relatives and friends with food, candles, and rituals.

Agnostica-December 14-Dress up like your favorite scientist.  Carry around a bag full of cheap gifts and allow everyone you meet to reach in and select one (the Random Bag of Fun).  http://www.agnostica.com

Festivus-December 23-Invented by <i>Seinfeld</i>, but people really celebrate it (a bunch came to my work last year).  Includes the Airing of Grievances, in which you tell family members the ways in which they have disappointed you, and the Feats of Strength (the head of the household is pinned in a wrestling contest, marking the end of Festivus).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus"

Unzipping their derision-stuffed fanny packs, they snarlingly lampoon netsmarks: ""He landed on his knee, that makes this a **3/75 match, OMG e-tragedy!""  Wrestlers in the WEE generally claim that they don't even know how to TURN ON a computer (which means they're still paying for porn, which validates the conventional wisdom that wrestlers are morons).  The ones who can turn computers on generally offer some variant of ""If you haven't been in the ring, you can't criticize a wrestler.""  BUT they'll gladly critique food, despite never being chefs, and criticize the potholes in the road, despite never being road workers.  Wrestlers have never been doctors, yet if someone offered to treat their bruises with a nice sulphuric acid bath, they would balk.  E-HYPOCRISY.  The argument that you can't criticize something unless you've done it is bunk.  If it were true, no one would be allowed to like or dislike movies or have a favorite restaurant or prefer one sinus medication over another.

As for the indy darlingz who blast the Net on their LJs and Myspaces...if it's a simple case of hating your customers, that's understandable.  Everybody does that.  But hopefully these slender bois understand that, if it were not for the Net, they would have much less stellar careers.

VINCE MCMAHON ANNOUNCES NEW DRUG POLICY
November 21, 2005


In a joint meeting today with the RAW and SmackDown rosters in the United Kingdom, in Sheffield, Vince McMahon announced that within the next several weeks, a new drug testing policy will be implemented in which performance enhancing drugs, such as steroids, etc., recreational drugs, as well as abuse of prescription drugs will be banned.

In addition to the new drug testing procedure, there will also be an emphasis on cardiovascular examinations.

The specifics of the drug policy will be announced over the next several weeks. More details to follow. Check with WWE.com for the latest information.

As others have said, we'll see whether or not anything actually comes of this or if it's just a knee-jerk cop-out for so many people being irate in the face of Eddie's death.  If this is legit, it should be accompanied by a reduction in the schedule...it's hard to stay off Somas when you're working 4-5 days a week with a mangled knee or screwed-up neck."

It's not enough to have some elderly person given a charity spot as a greeter, Best Buy has to put some annoying mini-suburbanite at the entrance.  I am then forced to acknowledge his/her ""How's it goin'?"" or treat them as I would a homeless person and keep walking without looking.  I spent all Saturday throwing up and passing out on my kitchen floor because I bought garlic bread from a hippie.  So I figured I deserved a pick-me-up, BUT as I tried to browse the horror section, no less than 4 different fux accosted me and asked me if I needed help (in other words, don't try to steal anything because we're watching you).  I finally get my movie (Addio Africa/Goodbye Uncle Tom, including boss slave-in-a-birdcage-helmet cover art) and try to check out.  The salesgirl demands my phone number (can I have yours?), then looks at the DVD and scowls.  Hey, whitegirl, I'm sure Africans in fake documentaries from the 1960's appreciate your being surrogate offended for them and all, but YOU ARE THE ONE SELLING THE MOVIE.  It is like some clerk at a porn store saying, ""Tranny Grannies?  What's wrong with you, buying this stuff?""  Funds are exchanged and I try to leave, but the drone at the front steps in my path to say, ""Have a good one!""  AARGH.  Best Buy is going on my boycott list, right next to Wal*Mart ('cept for TNA DVDs) and the WWE."

"event","So my parents left today after a week.  The highlights were pretty much:

*going to Red River Gorge in eastern KY, in the middle of the Daniel Boone Forest, and almost getting caught in the woods in the dark.  The people who run the Gorge must hate people because the ""guardrails"" are easily bypassed.  I stepped over one and sat with my legs dangling off of this rock and looked down at the forest floor.  This buzzard swooped right by me and my mom said, ""He's probably waiting for you to slip so he can get his lunch.""  Ha ha.  

*going to Paul Revere & the Raiders AGAIN.  Oh, the shame.  Some guy who looked like an older Hanson brother opened the show with annoying rockabilly and bad white soul.  His between-song patter reminded me of an overeager waiter who REALLY wants to sell you the special.  His music was like...songs to make white people feel better about themselves.  The emcee said to look for out for him on the charts soon.  Holy shit, people are out of touch.  No way songs about the ""high school hop"" are making any chart these days.  Rock music can be a lot of things, but it should never be pleasant.  It's the kiss of death.  Paul Revere & the Raiders was just surreal.  I had forgotten how Suburban American their audience is.  These are people who beat up the Woodstock hippies.  I had also forgotten how faggy the Raiders dress.  I'm surprised gay people haven't picked up on their camp value.  PR&theR had Americana shit everywhere, American flags on everything, and must've mentioned ""the vets"" and ""the troops"" about 5000 times to loud applause, but THEN they played ""Fortunate Son""!  Their audience apparently can't handle whole songs, either, so we got a medley set of about 25-30 verse-chorus ""songs"".  The bass player did a lot of slap bass for some reason.  If I weren't with my parents, it would've been a good idea to take some acid beforehand, as the Raiders are one of the few 60's bands left who can still deliver a mindfucking experience.  Just for all the wrong reasons.  As we were leaving the parking garage, there were no cars, only SUV's."

"event","Tonight was the first night I'd actually watched TNA apart from matches I downloaded.  I've been on Wal-Mart boycott for a long time, but since Wal-Mart was the only place to get the TNA box set, I went there and bought it (and a polyester fleece that I wore while I watched wrestling).  My overall opinion is that it's generally better than WWE as far as in-ring stuff, but it lags behind ROH, IWA-MS, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, & Chikara in that respect.  Other stuff...

*Johnny B. Badd is on here and he's WHITE!  I never understood what Mick Foley was talking about when he said WCW took a Jewish kid from New York and turned him into Little Richard, but MAN now I do.  I don't know if it was the mustache or excessive tanning or some kinda skin paint, but it's highly disturbing to see him now after seeing black Johnny B. Badd and Marc Mero.  The caucasian Badd is actually an OK wrestler, he does flying headscissors and ranas and such, so I guess his aching back is better.  

*To keep the balance, Raven is now BLACK...not in terms of skin color, but he quotes Public Enemy's ""Welcome to the Terrordome"" in promos and he wears a gladiator helmet like Farooq used to.  Although he also wears a skirt, so perhaps he is GAY instead.  Of the three matches with him I saw, only his match with DDP was not BORING and SHITTY.

*Don West is garishly awful as a commentator.  He called a chokeslam a powerbomb, although he generally just calls any move a ""slam"" or ""kick"" so as not to expose his amateurishness.  

*Jeff Jarrett is a much worse wrestler than I remember.  I'm no worker, but if you can't take a sunset flip (TWICE) without looking like a clumsy asshole, you should be working at the concession stand instead of carrying a belt.  On the flip side, I like Jeff Hardy much more than I thought I did, he actually put forth effort in his match with Jarrett, but all for naught.

*Except for AJ Styles, TNA wrestlers need new theme music.  Everything sounds like bad, bad WCW.  

*Ron Killings should be a heel and in the upper card.  In Memphis, he got magma heat.  Wasting him in 3 Live Kru with Konnan and Le Road Dogg is a bad decision.  I suspect that his being way too dark is a factor.

*No more tributes to Jimmy Snuka.  Girlfriend-killers don't deserve it.  He should have Machiavelli fame, where people recognize his influence, but don't say anything else good about him.

*Monty Brown fails at life as a wrestler, but he has the right look and charisma.  I can see WWE picking him up.  

*They should emphasize the X division as much as possible.  Not everybody there is good (I just can't dig Petey Williams, sorry, y'all), but with Joe, Aries, & Rod Strong (best pseudo gay porn name since Peter Steele), there's no way folks won't notice the quality of X div matches.  As opposed to, saaay, Jarrett vs. Nash."

"event","I'm fucking bored and I'm gonna post about a book I'm reading.  It's called The Right Nation and it's about how the Republicans have pretty much dominated American politics in the last half of the last century and the first part of this one.  It argues that all the really liberal figures like Carter or Ted Kennedy are considered failures and jokes and that Democratic successes like Clinton acted more like Republicans than traditional liberals (shrinking the size of government/facilitating free trade/having sex with fat and boring white women/etc).  The book argues that this has happened because Americans have become more conservative: minorities move from the cities to the suburbs, start families, open businesses, and suddenly tax cuts and pro-business laws look pretty good; Southern Christians have become more organized and thus more pronounced in party direction; and stuff like that.  The book says this is a long-term thing and that the Dems are basically on the endangered species list for the near future.  I think it's probably right.  

The book doesn't say it, but if Clinton was a Republican-esque Dem, then I'd argue that Bush is a Dem-esque Repub--profligate spending, increasing the size of government (homeland security covers maybe a fourth of government's total growth), anti-federalism (states can't determine for themselves who can get married or have medical marijuana or whether to allow assisted suicide), piling on steel tariffs to hamstring free trade, and so forth.

Hopefully, the Republican party will split between traditional economic/free market conservatives (who I tend to like) and social conservatives who don't understand how anyone could worship a FAT STATUE or want to have semen on their mustaches.  It looks like 2008 is gonna be Hillary versus somebody, and I'd much rather see McCain or Powell or Guiliani in the somebody spot rather than Bill Frist or John Ashcroft or some other Christ-sucking creep who wants to turn America into their own personal theocracy.  The best thing ever would be for a dynamic Libertarian to come along (except into protecting instead of selling the environment) and trounce both parties, but that is just a beautiful dream..."

"event","is the story of Timothy Treadwell, an eco-activist who spent 13 summers living in Alaska with brown grizzly bears.  During his last summer, he and his girlfriend were mauled and eaten by a bear, their deaths recorded on audiotape, later recovered from their campsite amidst ribcages and a partially-devoured arm.  The movie is really affecting, funny in places and yet very sorrowful, often for the same reasons.  Treadwell was a damaged kid, a wannabe movie star who failed to land a spot on <i>Cheers</i> and spent a big chunk of his life drinking his days away before finding a new role as ""protector"" of the bears.  In the videos, you can see him desperately trying to force-fit nature into his self-created mythology, treating the bears like his friends, talking to them and giving them cute names like Winston Cubby.  Of course, the bears weren't his friends, as his end attests.  The best part of the movie comes when Werner Herzog locks into a tight close-up of a bear's face and talks about he never saw anything like kinship or recognition in their eyes, just a bored and detached hunger.  Ultimately, the hard truth is that you may love nature, but that doesn't mean that nature gives a fuck about you.  The fantasies about nature being a place of innocent magical balance, devoid of the sufferings humans create for themselves, erode when your bear friend's jaws are snapping through your spinal column.  As the movie says, the universe is really all about chaos and murder, no matter what kinda hippie spin-job anyone tries to drape over it.

If a few things in my life had been different, I would've ended up like Timothy Treadwell.  He recognized and was repulsed by what he saw in humanity, that's why he became what he was.  It's always a dangerous thing to smother your disgust in some kind of repressed bizarro love outburst, whether that comes in self-styled hippie animal rights crusading or in Jesus-freak Christianity or in new-age fairy Wicca BS.  Honesty is the best policy--admit the world's a nightmare--the other way is where insanity lies."

No wonder Jill (the old one, not this one) dumped me!

I think I'm gonna be seriously looking for a new job soon.  Last night, they installed a new computer system and it was just pure chaos, maan.  They left some New York guy with me all night, my security guard (of course) disappeared, and the Noo Yawk guy made fun of rednecks and asked me why I like working nights.  So I say without thinking, ""Because I don't have to look at people that often.""  He looked at me like I was crazy.  Maybe I am.  When I got off work, I drove around listening to Johnny Cash and daydreaming of serial killers torturing people in dank basements SERIOUSLY, then bought a bottle of rum and got on LiveJournal.  I wanna be done with my degree so I just spend my days cataloging monographs and museum collections.  Fuck people, they're vile.  The whole progressive ""humanity gets better as it goes along"" idea is retarded.  People are getting weaker and worse, more shrill and demanding because of the emptiness of their lives.  People are monsters without suffering to temper their excesses.  It is so easy to survive nowadays because of the artificial comforts & bullshit that maybe Darwin shouldn't even be taught in schools anymore.  I would give up all my computer time and DVDs and wrestling videos and credit cards to be able to go back to the 1800's and live.  It would be delightful if humanity would go extinct soon.  

My brother is working for FEMA (I'm really, really proud of him) and having seizures, probably from doing so many drugs for such a long time.  My grandma is having some sort of back issue that leaves her weak and unable to eat.  The street where I first kissed a girl is (I guess) still underwater.  I'm getting a strong inclination to move back to MS or at least Arkansas (the U of K has a tradeoff program where I can go there and pay resident tuition).  For some reason, I feel like I need to be close to my family right now.  Hope they're not all dying soon or something.

Anyway, I wanna buy a gun.  Mr. Perea, you are the person I know most expert in these things other than my dad.  So...would a .38 be a good choice?  I want something that can delete an intruder, not something like a shotgun where I'll be scraping guts off my walls for weeks.

It has a lot of problems--it's too long with an unnecessary turn at the end to prolong the story, it resorts to bad cartoon CGI after using a nice stiff suit for half the film, there's too much comedy, it features a celebrity cameo by Scott Baio, it opens with a performance from Bowling for Soup (grrr).

Christina Ricci admits as much on the extras when she says that it's a movie about werewolves killing people and so you can't take it seriously (as opposed to movies about headless horsemen killing people).

BUT Zombie still doesn't grasp how to develop characters or put things together or leave out stuff that's incidental to the plot, so it's sometimes bloated and sometimes underdone.

BUT it had an authentic, mean-spirited grindhouse feel.

BUT it also had touches of art-school MTV-video self-importance and it was also a little too familiar in spots.

BUT Zombie finally noticed that sexual violence/humiliation is a key element of grindhouse.

BUT the sexual humiliation scenes were blatantly stolen from LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, almost like DEVIL'S REJECTS contains a mini-remake in its center, like a jewel in the navel of an Indian hooker.

BUT it was nice to see Michael Berryman (people looked at me when I said, ""Ohmigod!"", but they didn't look at my crotch during the sexual humiliation scenes, TY God), Ken Foree, & Diamond Dallas Page get a payday.  

BUT Karen Black wasn't here.

BUT the lady who played Mother Firefly in this one did a better job and was the Captain Spaulding of this film...the best character, the one you wanted to see more of.  And she's presumably not a Scientologist.

BUT the police characters were pretty shallow until the end.

BUT the end was fantastic, tense and brutal and kinda made up for the film's previous deficiencies.  

Nowhere near a classic, but not bad.  Nice and grim.  The next Zombie film might actually be something to go out of your way for.

Ordinarily, I wouldn't list a big spoiler like THERE IS A GIRL IN IT WHO POPS BALLOONS WITH DARTS THAT SHE SHOOTS WITH HER VAGINA, but that isn't even one of the bigger surprises in the movie, so no foul.  This thing was made for probably 1/4 the budget of MATRIX & other Hollywood junk, but it rocks EIGHTEEN times as hard.  It is getting so that I am antsy for other Americans to catch Takashi Miike fever so I can discuss these things with others.  But at the same time, I want to keep him to myself and I definitely do not want whining prematurely-jaded brats thinking that we have anything in common because I can recognize, and they can't deny, genius. ****

HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS:  Different from any Miike movie, or any movie ever made.  About a family that runs a hotel near a swamp whose guests keep dying.  So, to circumvent bad publicity, they throw the corpses in the swamp.  Made on a shoestring budget, so anytime an elaborate effects sequence is called for, the movie switches from reality to Claymation.  It sounds dumb, but in execution it's swank.  Oh yeah, AND it's a musical AND the corpses join in on one of the numbers.  If you don't love the scene where the daughter is doing cartwheels and her dress flies up and a big heart is superimposed over her crotch, then you are no friend of mine, sailor.

Depp is so good, every girl I know can be obsessed with him and I still cannot hate him or deny his power.  The kid who played Charlie and the guy who played Grandpa Joe were standouts.  The only weak point was the stuff with Wonka's dad (sorry, Christopher Lee!), the movie was proceeding along nicely until the dad flashbacks when it stumbled.

Oh, and fuck anyone who cares more about this than Shinya Hashimoto dying.  A chubby karate-using wrestler with Elvis sideburns is WAY more important than a hillbilly drama king, a boring Canadian with too many teeth, and the El Dandy-semen-coated slore who came between them.

"event","""The ingenuity of the Cheka's torture methods was matched only by the Spanish Inquisition.  Each local Cheka had its own speciality.  In Kharkov they went in for the 'glove trick'--burning the victim's hands in boiling water until the blistered skin could be peeled off: this left the victims with raw and bleeding hands and their torturers with 'human gloves'.  The Tsaritsyn Cheka sawed its victims' bones in half.  In Voronezh they rolled their naked victims in nail-studded barrels.  In Armavir they crushed their skulls by tightening a leather strap with an iron bolt around their head.  In Kiev they affixed a cage with rats to the victims' torso and heated it so that the enraged rats ate their way through the victims' guts in an effort to escape.  In Odessa they chained their victims to planks and pushed them slowly into a furnace or a tank of boiling water.  A favorite winter torture was to pour water on the naked victims until they became living ice statues.  Many Chekas preferred psychological forms of torture.  One had the victims led off to what they thought was their execution, only to find that a blank was fired at them.  Another had the victims buried alive, or kept in a coffin with a corpse.  Some Chekas forced their victims to watch their loved ones being tortured, raped, or killed.""

""One of the most terrifying aspects of the Terror was its random nature.  The knock on the door at midnight could come to almost anyone.  The Bolsheviks justified the Terror as a civil war against the counter-revolution.  But they never made clear who those 'counter-revolutionaries' were.  The round-ups were much too crude for that, sometimes consisting of no more than the random arrest of people on a stretch of street blocked off at each end by Cheka guards.  People were arrested merely for being near the scene of a 'bourgeois provocation' (e.g. a shooting or a crime)."""

"event","until CM Punk shows up in the WWE and everybody who has bashed him or called him a nobody is hopping on the bandwagon two weeks later.  Saw Punk last night in his next-to-last Ohikentuckiana match and it was the best performance I've seen him give in the 3 years I've been going to IWA shows.  Even though he was wrestling a guy much smaller than him (Matt Sydal), his selling was flawless and he was able to keep up with this cruiserweight without getting winded or restorting to chinlocks/sleepers.  Highlights: Sydal hitting a tope con hilo onto Punk's shoulders into a rana on the floor; Punk bodyslamming Sydal from the top rope for the win & Sydal getting up and vomiting for a good minute afterward, like Regan in THE EXORCIST; Punk immediately challenging a passing Nate Webb to ""come take the vomit slam"".  Give Punk THIS gimmick, I assure you he will be a main eventer in under a month!

GOODBYE CM PUNK WE'LL MISS U & UR ANTICZ!!!"

"event","I am sad that these people are Scientologists--Beck; Karen Black (aargh); Neil Gaiman; Greta von Susteren.  Here are more--Kirstie Alley; Edgar Winter; Dwayne from WHAT'S HAPPENING?; Patrick Swayze; Juliette Lewis (surprise, right?);  Lisa Marie Presley.  I guess it's too much to ask that a religion that claims that humans evolved from clams, that an alien intelligence planted volcano H-bombs & the souls of its victims are reincarnated in us, & that all illness, AIDS and ebola virus included, are psychosomatic not be taken seriously.  Then again, people believe all kinds of stupid shit.  Why not just avoid the middle man and throw your money directly into the toilet, gang?

For the sake of balance, peep this list of celebrity atheists--Clive Barker; Bjork; George Carlin; David Cronenberg; David Cross; Roger Ebert; Brian Eno; Jodie Foster; Margot Kidder (fuck yeah!); Ian McKellan; Camille Paglia; Penn & Teller (yesssss!); Gore Vidal; and James D. Watson (discoverer of DNA).  I tell you this, if there is an afterlife and it is divided into rooms separated by beliefs, I know which party I wanna attend.  Film discussions with Cronenberg & Ebert would rawk, plus (unlike Kirstie Alley) Bjork won't eat all the donuts."

"event","It was good enough.  At this point, the least of the four DEAD films, although my opinion might improve upon repeat viewing.  Probably the slowest of the four or at least tied with NIGHT.  Very high body count, AWESOME gore effects, amazing that they were able to cram so much in and still keep the R rating.  The director's cut/unrated version should be very good indeed.  NO modern music.  Good acting all around.  More overtly sociopolitical stuff than any previous DEAD movie (""we don't negotiate with terrorists"").  I'd be interested in a sequel IF they keep the focus on the right, um, side.  Hope it makes A LOT of money (our theater was full) and allows George to make movies that people in the States will see (as opposed to BRUISER and the like) and proves to Hollywood that folks wanna see good horror flicks and not DARKNESS or THE BOOGEYMAN or WAR OF THE WORLDS.

On that, I had initially decided to boycott WAR OF THE WORLDS because the media overdosed me on Tom Cruise, his rented paramour, and his ridiculous & infantile religion.  BUT after seeing the Today show this morning and seeing the unleashed genius of the Tom Cruise heel turn (""Psychiatry is a pseudoscience!  There's no such thing as a chemical imbalance!  Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt...""), I have to say that I am entertained and captivated and anticipate what public kookout will come next.  Will he claim that the Jews run the world under the Protocols of Zion?  Will he discuss the age-old battle between the Lizard People of Hollow Earth and their enemies the Bird People?  I might even buy a ticket to a Steven Spielberg movie (and put money in the old pedophile's pockets) if it means more CRAZY EVIL TOM CRUISE ON MY TV..."

That's a better argument than ""evil bad-thinking sand tyrant"".  It would never get over with The American People, since very few even remember what communism was anymore or can focus on protracted logical arguments.  It also assumes that Stalin and Saddam Hussein were equal in terms of ability, resources, and aspirations, AND it neglects the positive things that came outta the Cold War like the Space Race and hot expatriate Rus'kie babes.  But it's prolly the best pro-war argument I've heard yet."

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>friday - mindy gets off the bus w/ me. me, mindy, and kirstey catch up w/ samaha and ourso. we got to walmart act the fooL. blake tried on girl clothes, it was hilarious. we soon catch up with spencer and we all go chill with him. we go ride the golf cart, where we make a hit and run.. haha it was SO funny. but soon later, we all skeet and leave spencer driving by himself on the golfcart where the man stops him and tells him to fix the mailboxes that we broke. so we all go back and fix it. lol and then me, mindy, ourso, blake, and spencer all get ready to go to kirstey's bonfire. we go, wayne already there. so soon enough, petit gets there and later on katie does too. we all chil there by the fire and talk. they all go home around 11:30-12 and me, mindy, and katie sleep over. we talked about the ""girl stuff"", ya know how that goes. and then go to sleep.</P>
<P>saturday- we get up and eat PANCAKES! :) yay. get dreesedd, we go walk around and chill outside. it was a beautiful day. katie goes home at 2 and then me, mindy, kirstey, adn jodie go to the movies for 6 and go see ""HIDE and SEEK"" which was pretty retarded. don't go see it. lol we drop off mindy at walmart and we go shopping where we seen some people we know and then we drop off jodie off at her house. me and kirstey get to my house where we soon are bored because we have nothing to do so we fall asleep. lol</P>
<P>sunday- kirstey leaves and i get up and get dressed and chill, and talk on the internet. soon enough, spencer IMs me and says come over to ourso's to watch movies so me and kirstey go over there adn we watch movies and chill. and here's the funny/bad part.. spencer and jordan deside let's be douche bags and steal jessica's cell phone so we can write people dirty text messages so i like tackle them down for them not to do that. and then they try to do it again when we are in ourso's room but this time OURSO elbows me in the nose and makes me have a nose bleed. MY FIRST NOSE BLEED THANKS TO JORDAN OURSO. jesus. and after all of this, they don't do it :) that's the good part. later on, we come back to my huose and they go to spencer's..me and kirstey go inside and she soon goes home. and i've been shootin' the bull ever since.. lol.</P>
<P><BR>this week better be good. <STRONG>2 HALF DAYS</STRONG>. :) YAY.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><BR>Do you ever miss me? Do you ever miss the way we used to be? When we used to talk and laugh and flirt? When you used to purposely bump into me in the hall just so you could see me look at you and smile? Do you miss our conversations? And what about our dumb sarcasm that only you and I understand? Do you ever miss any of that? I think that maybe you do, because sometimes when I look at you, you'll randomly look at me and stop what you're doing just so you can look into my eyes like you used to, and even though it only lasts for two seconds, do you miss that? I can't be the only one who does. If I could show you how much I was hurting, you'd never be able to look me in the eyes again.</P>"

"event","<P>so yeah, school is fricken school.</P>
<P>&amp; i've been thinking. it's not for anybody in particular, just people in general ya know.</P>
<P>&nbsp;why do people feel the need to bring up the past and rub it in your fucking face? and why do people feel this need to try and prove themselves one better than everyone else? why do people always go ""well oh yeah, i can do this..."" in the end what are you proving? why start shit that doesn't needed to be started? fucking retarted. what's the fucking deal?&nbsp;you get pissed about the stupidest shit and start yelling and blah blah blah. LET THE SMALL SHIT GO! why waste your life, time, and energy bitching about shit that no one cares about? are you really that ignorant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>yeah this entry is pointless, just thought that thing above was&nbsp;true. i thought i should let you know that you shouldn't give a shit about anything that people say about you. you know the truth, and nothing else matters. and if they want to make you the center of attention, they must be jealous or wanna be just like you cause why waiste timee talkin' about someone or something.. if you got beef, tell it to their face. sorry to the ones i have ever done this to, i truely do see that it's really stupid.</P>
<P>dude, i'm starving. i'm out.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;missin' you. :-/</P>

"event","No school today.  yay for snow days.  Even OSU called off.  Looking outside it doesn't seem like it was a lot of snow... oh well.  Another day to relax and try to understand stupid pre calc.

So my cat Tiger.  I swear, he's gay.  he likes to curl up with his brother.  He loves my boyfriend, but hates all my gal friends.  He loves me, but I'm his master, so he has to lol.

I need to clean my turtle tank.  I gave my two red eared sliders 4 guppies, and i can't find the fish.  So I guess they ate them over night (about time).  I can't wait until I can get them a 50 gal tank.  they are going to be so happy!

I can't believe my bday is in a week.  I can't believe I'm going to turn into an adult without my dad.  He' is gonna miss my senior year of softball.  My graduation.  My wedding.  My kids.  Maybe I should have had school today, it keeps me preocupied from this.

*sigh* Is there something that can take you back in time?  I would use it.  Senior year is supposed to be the best year of highschool... not really for me.  Nothing has gone right yet.  Besides getting sorta engaged.   But that is besides the point.

"event","Wow Pre-Calc is kicking my ass.  I don't get it.  Trigonomic Identities. WTF?  I get the super easy ones, why can't I understand it enough for a test?  AP Gov is annoying.  I don't care about Congress right now.  Drawing is pointless, I can draw better than half the tards in there.  Fitness for life is pointless because I ruined both my knees, and tore my rotator cuff.  I'm lucky I can still play softball.  Ceramics is so fun.  I actually love working with clay.  I made my daddy a heart, I think I'm gonna put it on his grave when I go visit him.  AP/KAP English is sweet.  A bunch of reading.  I love reading!  And Orchestra... oh god Mr. Riegel... I'm so sick of that nerd.  He micromanages way too mcuh.

Softball is great.  I'm team captian again.  Joy.  Stupid freshmen do NOT listen.  During mandatories next week I'm going to make them run like there is no tomorrow.  They think it is all just fun and games; it's not.  You want to play, you have to work hard.  And I don't have a first base girl.  Not good.

OSU still hasn't told me if I am in or not.  I applied in October. They are giving my app a 2nd review.  Just cuz I got a 27 on my ACT.  I took that a 2nd time, to get the 27, a week after my dad was killed.  Too bad, I could have probably gotten a 32.  Anyhoo, I'm royaly pissed.  My Boyfriend got accepted off campus to mansfield OSU.  I just want main campus.  I have the grades, extras and scores to be accepted into their honor's program.

So I sould be trying to figure out pre calc.  I'm not.  I am finding it hard to care.  I've spent the last two weeks trying and failing.  How many times can I do this before it's pointless?

I hate the house I live in that's not a home.  my mom's husband is not too great.  He is mean to me and his two sons (one of which is my bf).  Yeah, that's right,  They met and married all in the better part of 4 months, not even caring if it would hurt me and james' relationship.  Well, it's been tring, let me tell you.  Fitting 5 people in a condo ment for two or three? fuck I'm living in a closet room smaller than Harry Potter's.  I went from a great life... traumatized and tortured, but still better than this...  When will it end?"

Today was an okay day.  Finished my special circumstances to send to OSU.  Had to re live some not so great parts of my life, aka the last 4 years.

My dad was murdered two months ago.  Still not doing too great after that."

"event","Well, I survived the first three days of school. Yes I did. I have been on lj for almost a year now too!
----------------
On to more important subjects: I am going to start the next 2 golf matches. This means that I only need to start 4 more to get a letter!! And we have like 10 more to go!!!
--------------
I also have picked out a song to do for the talent show this year.
---------------------------
Well, I have two classes in trailers at my highschool. My first period class, World Studies, I sit under the air conditioning vent in Trailer I-1. I freeze to death in the already cold morning! Then I go into the school for gym. So then I get to be over-heated from running and being over athletic, like I normally am. Yesterday, I beat every boy in my class at basketball (nock-out). Then I go back outside into Trailer E-1. That trailer is an ice-box. Then I go back inside, up the stairs and to the other side of the school to my Honor's Science class. Then I go to Spanish II just down the hall. THEN I go to lunch at 12:01. THEN I go back to spanish for something called Panther period. It's like a study hall that everyone in the school has. I have lunch #3 btw. There are 4 lunches. THEN I go to English On the other side of the school upstairs. Then I go to my locker to get my stuff to go home, and go Downstairs to the Orchestra room for Sympany orchestra. Then I get on bus 30 to go home. I am on a country bus. Meaning that I am on it first in the morning at 6:24, and get off last in the afternoon at 3:40. School gets out at 2:37. I am on the bbus for 1 hour each way! School starts at 7:45. *sigh*

I hope you found this entry interesting.

OH! And I am sooooo Ticked off at the fact that Scientists are calling Pluto a 'Dwarf' Planet! They wern't even going to keep it at it's planet status!!! And what about Sedna? And Quaoa (sp)??And Crena?!? PLUTO HAS THREE SATALITES (moons) FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!! Creana is between Mars and Jupiter! Sedna and Quaoa are in teh Oort cloud 8 billion miles out from Pluto. Sedna takes 10,584 years to rotate the sun in a HIGHLY eliptical orbit. Sedna is also on a different plane than the rest of the planest. Sedna alos has a satalite (moon)!!!!!! GAH! Scientists really set me off! Thats why I wanna become one, so I can yell at all these DWEEBS that think they can downsize a much loved Planet!!!!

"event","Our softball game last night was forfited half-way through the game b/c it was raining so hard! We were already playing in the rain. Down third base, it was basically a mud slide. Every girl who bunted, I had to run up to get the ball (that they always fouled) and sliping and falling on my knees! The batter's box was a sticky mess too. When I got on 2nd base (after I had hit) I went about half way to 3rd, pretending like I was going to steel. The girl then through the ball to 2nd. While the trough was happining, I literally dove into 2nd. The ump took his gooood old time at saying wether I was safe or not. I was safe, and everyone was happy! Yay! When I get up, there is mud all down my front, in my hair, in my mouth, in my shoes etc... All in all, it was the most funest game I have played in a long time!!"

West Jet airline attendants make an effort to make the in-flight ""safety lecture"" and announcements a bit more entertaining. Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported:  

A very ""senior"" flight attendant crew, the pilot said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached cruising altitude and will be turning down the cabin lights. This is for your comfort and to enhance the appearance of your flight attendants."" 

On landing, the stewardess said, ""Please be sure to take all of your belongings. If you're going to leave anything, please make sure it's something we'd like to have.""  

""There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of this airplane."" 

""Thank you for flying West Jet Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride."" 

As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at the Vancouver Airport, a lone voice came over the loudspeaker: ""Whoa, big fella. WHOA!"" 

After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Ontario, a flight attendant on a West Jet flight announced, ""Please take care when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything has shifted."" 

From a West Jet Airlines employee: ""Welcome aboard West Jet Flight 245 to New York. To operate your seat belt, insert the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just like every other seat belt; and, if you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public unsupervised."" 

""In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with more than one small child, pick your favourite."" 

Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but we'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than West Jet Airlines."" 

""Your seat cushions can be used for flotation; and in the event of an emergency water landing, please paddle to shore and take them with our compliments."" 

""As you exit the plane, make sure to gather all of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants.. Please do not leave children or spouses."" 

And from the pilot during his welcome message: ""West Jet Airlines is pleased to announce that we have some of the best flight attendants in the industry. Unfortunately, none of them are on this flight!"" 

Heard on West Jet Airlines just after a very hard landing in Edmonton: The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, ""That was quite a bump, and I know what y'all are thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't the airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight attendant's fault, it was the asphalt."" 

Overheard on an West Jet Airlines flight into Regina, on a particularly windy and bumpy day: During the final approach, the Captain was really having to fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight > Attendant said, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Regina. Please remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened while the Captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate!"" 

Another flight attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: ""We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the terminal."" 

An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the Passengers exited, smile, and give them a ""Thanks for flying our airline."" He said that, in light of his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. 

Finally everyone had gotten off except for a little old lady walking with a cane. She said, ""Sir, do you mind if I ask you a question?"" ""Why, no, Ma'am,"" said the pilot. ""What is it?"" The little old lady said, ""Did we land, or were we shot down?"" 

>>>>After a real crusher of a landing in Halifax, the attendant came on with, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced, we will open the door and you can pick you way through the wreckage to the terminal."" 

>Part of a flight attendant's arrival announcement: ""We'd like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of West Jet Airways.""  

>Heard on a West Jet Airline flight. ""Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to smoke, the smoking section on this airplane is on the wing. If you can light 'em, you can smoke 'em."" 

>A plane was taking off from the Winnipeg Airport. After it reached a comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the intercom, ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome to Flight Number 293, non-stop from Winnipeg to Montreal, The weather ahead is good and, therefore, we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax... OH, MY GOD!"" Silence followed, and after a few minutes, the captain came back on the intercom and said, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared you earlier. While I was talking to you, the flight attendant accidentally spilled a cup of hot coffee in my lap. You should see the front of my pants!"" A passenger in Coach yelled, ""That's nothing. You should see the back of mine!"""

Until I cannot see you anymore?
If you fold one person,
You can't know what will happen.
I want to watch it forever...

there isn't even a way...
I simply look up at the sky.
Like a small bird in my face,
I searched for a window,
I searched without a lead...
I want&nbsp; to see you right now,
Because I love you.
Althout I'm so scared I'll hurt you
I want to run away

You will still be the most important person...."

Bigger than letting myself get used. 
Bigger than ending up alone on the street in blood. 
Bigger than trying to kill myself. 
Bigger than not letting anyone near me. 
Bigger than anyhting else, I hurt you. 
It's exactly what I was trying to keep from happening and that's all that became of it. You hate me and I realize that. 
I can probably never make it up to you, and I realize that. 
But I've made the worst choice I've ever done by not getting to be with you. 

All I've wanted is to keep you safe. 
You don't have any clue what I'm really like. Why I'm here. 
It's horrible. 
and to know I was something that would make you upset is&nbsp;worse than dying.

"event","<p>....Where words don't mean shit :D<br />actions speak louder than words, and what you've done my sir is a symphony of obnoxiously loud and high-pitched screams.<br />You said you'd get bored and leave, anyways. But wow. Congrats. That was pretty fast *claps* Too bad, you never got what you said you wanted, which I'm starting to think is the whole reason you stuck around in the first place.<br />The things I couldn't do for you, and I guess the thing you wanted.<br /><br />Dosen't seem like you're getting off too badly, <br />spend some time with a guy, say some stuff<br />then do that <em>other</em> thing with his friend.<br /><br />fuck. I knew today was going to be bad. I shouldn't have gotten out of bed...&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />which reminds me, I need a replacement bed day since I pretty much ruined it this year -____-</p>"

"event","&nbsp;Well, I feel like crap :D<br />I'm pretty much tired as sin, cold all over and my eyes feel like they're going to fall out, roll around and then stab me in the jugular. <br />but OTHER than that...<br />I've been having a lot of fun with Vivian :D&nbsp; &lt;3 He's been doing a&nbsp; very very good job at keeping me away from textbooks x.x&nbsp; I've made 2 big promises to him,&nbsp; and even though the first one I'm pretty sure neither of us knew I'd be able to keep, I'm going to do what I can to make sure the second one happens :]<br />and Jon ^^ &lt;33 Another person I've made a big promise to. I'll keep this one without a doubt. I only want what's best for you, and I want you to know I'll do anyhting for you .<br />OH. Randy and I watched the best movie today in honour of his not-unbirthday. ^___________^<br /><br />Man. In 38 days I'llve been here for a whole year :\<br />that seems almost surreal. It's been a whole year since I went from seeing my sisters regularly, from being known by everyone the second I entered a room, having people follow my every step, from being wanted like that. (though, I did give out an autograph the other day :P )<br />I think I've fucked up a hell of a lot while being here, but I've made a bunch of friends ^^<br />and on that note, <br />I tyhink I lost one this week... I'd realy like to have him not hate me, but I have no clue what to do. <br />but at least we came to terms with the fact that I'm a whore that's not worth his time :]<br />strike THAT off my to-do list. <br /><br />well, I guess that's it for now. if anyone new wants to hit me up I'll probably just be in my room. <br />reading x.x&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />if you want to help me with some of the bigger enligh words or the french words or whatever, feel free to :D<br /><br /><em>PrinceTotchi</em><br /><br /><br />"

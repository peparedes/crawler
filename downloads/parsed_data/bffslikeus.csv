"event","Okay so this is the joke that Jake told us~
So these two kids, Jimmy and John, were outside for recess playing baseball and Jimmy was wining so John wanted to get back at him, and these little girls were on the teter toter, so John told Jimmy to call this one little blonde girl golf balls, and so he was like what does that mean? and John is like just go tell her dude, so he walked up to the little blonde cute girl, and called golf balls, and she started screaming and she was flipping out and she was like throwing rocks and the teacher ran up to her and thought she was possesed and was like omg what is wrong with u? And she couldnt talk and was stuttering every word, but she finnally got it out, and said, Jimmy called me golf balls! And so the teacher got so mad! she was like WHAT! and she grabberd Jimmy by the ear and dragged him in the door and down the hall and up the stairs, and to the principals office, and Jimmy was sitting and waiting to go to the principals office, and he was cring and he didnt kno what was going on or what the word meant because he is only 8 years old, and so the principal asked what Jimmy did, and he said that his friend told him to go up to this little blonde girl and call her golfballs, and the principal started flipping out, and he is like OMG three weeks suspention for u! So Jimmy went and got all his books together and started dragging all his books and backpack home, He was kicking rocks and talkignt o himself and he was mad, then he saw his grandma and, she ran up to him and was ike Jimmy i havent seen u in so long, how have u been? and she made him a fresh batch of yummy cookies, chocolaty and peanutbuttery, and yummy stuff. So he was eating milk and cookies, and his grandma is like okay so what happend? And so he told her what happend and what he called the girl, and that he got 3 weeks of suspention. And when she heard what he called the lil girl she went off on him, throwing the tray of cookies and milk spilled everywhere, and had a tantrum. Then she called the police and Jimmy was taken away in a cop car, and like 5 cop cars were fallowing the one car he was in to the police station, Then the next week he had a court trial, and all his friends were there, and Little blondey was still having a fit and was all mad and crying, And then the judge was like what did u do young man? ANd Jimmmy told him, and Jimmy was shaking and almost to tears because he was afraid of what would happen to him. And when the the judge heard he gave little Jimmy 20 years in prison. And Jimmy was so confused and didnt kno why he had to go to prison for sumthing he dont even kno what it means or why it is so bad. So all the guys in prison were scarred of him because he called her golfballs and he had no friends. He was the most unhappy person there though. Finnally 20 years later, he went to mcdonalds, and starts throwing back strawberry milkshakes, he drank 1 for every year he was in prison, then a worker came up to him and was like, geez dude slow down, ur hitting them pretty hard, ur gunna freeze! So Jimmy was like man i just got out of prison, i was in there for like 20 years! And the other guy is like geez dude what did u do?! And Jimmy really didnt want to talk about it, but the other guy kept begging him, so finnally Jimmy told him what happend. And he was like dude u have to help me i dont kno what this means! So the guy was like oh, that is so not cool, but i will tell u what it means, meet me behind the barn across the street in 10 minutes. So Jimmy was all syked, and he was like YES i can finnally find out what i did wrong and what golfballs means! so 10 mins later he was on his way to find out what this means and was about to cross the street and BAM!!! he got hit by a bus. The moral of the story is look both ways before crossing the street. 
LOL 
howd u like that?
when we heard it, both of us wanted to strangle Jake. It was so funny though. lol
2 cows were ina  meddow and the first cow says MOOO and the other cow says, hey i was gunna say that.

"event","Monday~ Today we began our wonderful trip to the Dells.  It took four hours and then we got there and set up and like a 1/2 hour after we got there this guy Jake, came up to our camper and asked us, ""do you guys wanna play volleyball with us? Please! it is no fun with just two people on a team""  so we went and played with him and his friends, Nick, Mitch, Gary. We were on his team cuz he wanted ""the girls"" and the other guys were on a team.  So he said we were hott, but he liked tamara way more. lol. (I liked Nick.) Then they left to go to Noah's Ark, and when they got back me and tamara were playing volleyball and Jake came back and was talking to us.  And he works at Hollister and we get a disscount cuz we are soo hott. ;).  Then we were playing volleyball and Eric, Shaun, and Eric's two sisters came to play too.  I sorta liked Eric but not at first. They were kinda weird. Well then another one of eric's sisters came to play and then this guy Donnie, and John and his girlfriend came and then this other guy. So we had a real game going and it took like an hour to play a 15 pt. game, but it was pretty fun!
Then later we were listening to music, in the same chair, with headphones, and we saw some guys go by and it was Jake, Eric and Shaun.  Then Jake asked us to have some S'mores. And we said yes and we ended up walking all the way around the place and asked then why they did that and they said ""we wanted to make it look smooth to pick up u girls."" lol. So then we got there and Jake didn;'t have any marshmallows so me and tamara had to walk ALLL the way back to our site and get some and we came back and Jake was telling these Jokes and they were really funny (we'll write them in another journal thing) But he had the funniest laugh every time he told a joke. Then later we had to go home and Jake walked us home and then Eric and Shaun came running up to us, and then they wanted us to go back and stay for a while and so we said he would have to ask my parents, so he started making small talk with them, "" So i heard the paryt is here"" that was Jake. And so, yea they wanted us to sneak out and come back but we didnt feel like getting in so much trouble. So we got ready for bed aand stuff, and then at like 12:15, we heard like knocking on the side of our camper where Me and Tamaras heads were, i heard it first though because he called me Elizabeth and i got mad, and then woke Tamara up and they told us to open the zipper part, so Tamara did because she was by the window, and we were talking to them for a while and they wanted us to come outside with them and walk around and yea, and later we find out that we would have been able to go outside but like not away from our area. And they wouldnt leave till we said we loved them but, it was funny. lots o fun!

Tuesday~ We got ready and when we walked out of the bathroom Jake was leaving and,he denied coming to our camper the night before but I was like, ""It was funny though"" and he said, ""I kno it was wasnt it"" so he kinda blew it, lol. So the rest of the day we basically hung out with Eric and Shaun. And went shopping. Then after we got ready for bed, we were wakling back to the camper and Eric and Shaun were standing outside talking to my parents. So we watched a movie, sixteen candles, but i heard seventeen was better, lol jk. Jake moment. 

Wednesday~ Eric and Shaun left and we met Erin, he was really cool, we played volleyball for a while and then Donnie came over and he played to. It was Erin and me against, Tamara and Donnie, Tamara won. lol And these lil annoying kids came and were barrying our feet UGH. so yea, And we got rum flavored taffy, it was yummy.

Thursday~ So we were playing volleyball in the street right by our camper and this guy that worked there kept waving and smiling and stuff, and he was pretty hot, so later we went mini golfing and these three guys were in front of us and i got a pic of them with my camera phone thing. There names were Andrew Paul and Ben. They were cute. umm we walked home from mini golfing and the guy that worked there started talkign to us and it was funny. But we were leaving 2moro and he didnt start work till aftre we were gunna leave. On our way to the game room these guys in a van were doing some weird dance, and the guy saw us laughing and he started laughing, then they left but they gave us there car pass. for sum reason, but it was funny. Then we met Dave and Trev, they were skaters and they were really funny. This lil kid kept talking about tricks he could do and Dave was getting annoyed and was like great, cool, sweet, but the lil kid just kept talking. Then they went swimming and told us to come, but it was cold so we just put out feet in. Then Trevor said he was gunna try and pull us in, and then he got out and tried splashing us, but we got away and started wiping off with there towels. And I threw in Daves sandle, and Tamara threw in Trevors, but they floated so it didnt make a diff, and Dave threw in my sandle. And they were trying top swim with there sandles on, it didnt work, then we gave them there towels and they almost fell in. Dont kno why, lol jk. Then Erin tried to get us to play skipbo? with him. dont kno what that is but we didnt want to so, I pretended my cell rang and said it was on vibrate, and Tamara was like what? How did that happen and almost ruined it. And said that my mom wanted us to come home for supper and it was like 4:30. lol yea Then four other guys asked us to play volleyball and it was funny, we got pretty good at volleyball by then. yea

Friday~ Tear!! We had to start packing and leave!! It was sad, But Tamara was excited to eat her sandwich. I dont kno why though. There were a lot of good times! Chuga chuga chuga chuga chuga chuga chuga chuga chooo choooo!! YAY!! Sniff PAAAAA. lol okay , omg and this guy there looked like Noah from the Notebook and, we were checking out of the campground, and me and Tamara ran outsoide and i slipped and my flippy got caught under the tire, and Tamara started cracking up and she almost fell over, and she was walking around the car and the guys were all looking at us. it was FUNNY!!!!! lol okay done.

"event","Okay so yesterday me and liz ere gunna go shopping, before that we were downstairs and we were both in rolling chairs and she fell off of hers but it came down with her. She always seems to fall with the chair, its so funny! Then we were in the car and i was on the drivers side on back and cars were going by and i didnt want to spit my gum out on a car so liz rolled down her window and i threw it and it hit the rim of the window and bounced back and hit lizs hand and she screamed and i couldnt stop laughing, so then i got it and threw it out  the window. Then we went shopping and everything, then when we got home we were sliding on their new hardwood floor, it worked really well to, I wished our hardwood floor did that buts ours isnt slippery, and we were sliding then we were being spys. kinda. Then she accidenttally glued her finger to the floor, and i was laughing hysterically because she couldnt get it off. I guess u had to be there but she was having problems. And i already read pages of the stupid book we have to read for summer stuff, yay. I have to find my camera so byebye

Love
   ~Tamara~

P.s When i was gunng leave i had a piece of tape and she had the sink hose thigny, that  comes out and u can spray, so she sprayed me and said it was a reaction because i almost got her with a stupid little piece of tape, and the she threw her cup of water in my face, so i filled mine and got her bakc and i was really wet, and my shirt and hair was dripping wet, it was fun.
But i got her back. lol"

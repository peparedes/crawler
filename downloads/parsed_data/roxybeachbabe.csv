I had a great weekend this past weekend with all my friends. We went down to the keys and stayed in Rick's house down there. It was amazing. We spent the day at the beach Saturday and went to key west that night. Now I must continue to catch up on sleep! Hope to see everyone over the break! E-mail or call me if you wanna hang out!
Love you all!"

Your Beauty lies in Plain Sight. Plain, simple and the girl next door. People tend overlook you as you are the ""normal girl"", but you're actually very beautiful. And you have plenty about you to set you apart, but more that lets you blend. People love the stability you have because as others may come and go, you will always be there and you may always be the same. You like simple things and that's what people like about you. You most likely enjoy things most consider normal, like movies, shopping, that sort of thing and are very friendly and probably have many friends. You are sweet and kind and that shows on you, but you're also strong and not very naive. You're a rather well-rounded individual. Even though some people pass you off as just another girl, shrug it off because they don't know what they're missing.

Some Things That Represent You:

Element: Earth, Light Animal: Cat Color: Pinks, Blues, Browns Song: Girl Next Door by Pilot Expression: Simple Smile

Gemstone: Alexandrite Mythological Creature: Fox Demon, Hobbit Sign: Tauros Planet: Jupiter Hair Color: Light Brown Eye Color: Brown

Friday night was amazing! I went out on a yacht with my best friends here (except Robyn cuz she had to work and Ashley had to do UMTV stuff). But it was soo much fun! We went up the intercoastal waterway to Ft. Lauderdale and saw all the big houses and saw all their big boats (some of which made the 58 foot yacht we were on look small). I also was quick to realize how frivilous (sp?) a society we live in...I mean who really needs a house that big. And why would you need a yacht that big? It was so surreal all night. 
I have come to the conclusion that Halloween is an excuse for girls to look as slutty as possible and get away with it and men to be as naked as possible and still covered and get away with it or to be dressed as a woman. I didn't go out tonight cuz I have a test in the morning but I saw plenty of costumes in the dorms and that was enough for me. Congrats to all the girls who looked amazing and cute and didn't look like whores (like Mary, Kate, and Ashley). I'm uber glad Halloween is almost over though!"

I didn't have any classes today thanks to a wonderful coincidence of all of them being canceled so I had plenty of time to study in a leisurely manner. I studied for like an hour before lunch and another hour after. Tonight I studied for 2 more outside. I've gone over and over some of this stuff and it still seems like it's not in my head. It's driving me insane!! But other than that I'm ok. I only got to see Dana at lunch and a very short dinner today and I don't get to see him tomorrow either. He has a super crazy schedule until Friday. It kinda sucks but we're both staying here for fall break so we'll spend time together this weekend. But I'm heading to bed so I can try to be well rested for my test tomorrow and use every free moment to study and not nap like I usually do!! Comment cuz I miss ya!"

I went up to Publix to see everyone there Saturday night and ended up sitting out in the parking lot with Greg until 11:15. Yea...We're not talking about that anymore...But it was great to see everyone there. Sunday I went to church and saw like half the youth group and tons of other people. We stayed after like an hour cuz I was talking to everyone. It was so good to see everyone. I couldn't believe how many people actually missed me. It was great to see everyone and spend a quiet weekend at home. I got a lot of work done and stuff. But now that I've screwed up I have to fix some things so it's even worse coming back here."

"event","Last night I went to a public forum on our oceans and how they're in trouble. It made me want to cry. There are so many places that everything is completely disappearing from them. 
I think I realized why I'm not happy. I'm not involved. At home I was involved in a lot and did community service and stuff like that. I'm really not doing that here. So I'm going to find something and do community service with something. I think I'm going to try to go to mass Sunday and see if that helps. Especially after last night I feel the need to get involved in something. Something to make me feel like I am contributing to this world I live in. In this community I love. I dunno
Tonight's another football game and I'm super stoked. I love football games. And tonight is the freshman walk where all of the freshman class that is there gets to walk around the field as a class. We get free shirts for it too. It's supposed to be really fun."

I feel like I'm just ""going through the motions"". I get up and go to class and do all my homework and talk to my friends like everyone else. But what am I living for? Like a month ago I was happy. I really felt like I belonged here and I had found my group of friends that I like to be around. I still feel that way but I'm just not happy. And I don't know why. I'm doing relatively well in all my classes. I have a great boyfriend who supports me and listens to me and cares about me. I have great friends who care about me too. This past weekend I got to hang out with my best friend for a day. Why am I not happy? What am I living for? What makes me get out of bed everyday? (besides the fact that I HAVE to go to classes)."

<P>This morning when I woke up and was getting ready for classes I got lightheaded and dizzy so I sat down to see if it would pass and it kinda did but as soon as I stood up it came back. I was talking to my boyfriend on-line and I got him to bring me down some ceral because maybe my bloodsugar was low or something. After eating a couple of handfuls of ceral I craweld back in bed. I was forced to get up for my 10:10 class because I had a midterm in there today. I actually think I did well on it too! Since I got out of class early I stopped by the ARC to see if I could get a job there because one of my professors works in there and told us that they needed people to work there. After looking at my availability the lady said they could probably use me during those times! So hopefully by the end of the week I'll have a job! :) Then I ate lunch and took the greatest hour long nap ever! Then I got up and went to my bio lecture that was boring as always. In my marine science lab though we got to go to the seaquarium and observe the manatees. It was soo fun watching them swim around and eat. I didn't have much work to do tonight so I've just hung around here all night. The only bad thing is that the idiots that I'm partners with for bio lab didn't do their parts for the write up until tonight. I got one guy's part at 11 and I still haven't gotten the other part. So now I'm going to check my e-mail for the hundredth time and hopefully I'll be happy this time. Comment cuz I miss ya!</P>"

The sole purpose of this wonderful phone call was to yell at me for ""pissing away his hard earned money"" because I went to dinner in South Beach with Robyn. I decided to go out for one night and enjoy myself and I get yelled at for it. He even cared enough to tell me that if ""we have this conversation again it will be in person and I will be packing up your car and you will be coming home and working at McDonalds and going to Polk."" I love the fact that my father cares so much about me to call me for the first time since I've been here to have this grand conversation with me. He is such a loving a good father. It makes me want to run home into his loving arms right this second.
CAN ANYONE TELL HOW FREAKIN' SARCASTIC I'M BEING RIGHT NOW!!! SOMEONE PLEASE KILL ME OR MY FATHER FOR ME!
Why must he be so unreasonable? Why must he still try to control me? Why? Does he realize what he is doing? 
It just feels like he's waiting for me to screw up so he can be like ""Ha! I told you so. Now come back here so I can piss and moan about fixing it while I control every aspect of your life."" That's what I feel like he's saying to me! It drives me up the wall!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really have my own stress to deal with I don't need the added stress that my father so lovingly puts on my shoulders all the time. (sarcasm once again!) That's all now. I need to continue to do work. 
You know what sucks about this all is that I can't go shopping because I can't afford to. I am an emotional shopper and right now I really wanna go to the mall and spend some money. That would make everything better. That's what I really want to do right now. But I can't. That's ok. Now I am motivated to do work. So now I'm going to do work."

CNN and MSNBC started broadcasting from campus so I watched hardball. Thursday night was the debate. Friday night I went to see Shark Tale (so so great and funny). And on Friday I got back the short answer part of my bio test and got all 25 points for it which means I got a 82.7% on it. and I got a B on my history paper which was the first paper I've written down here. So I was pretty happy. Then today we went to Key Biscayne for a bit and then South Beach and layed out there and then ate dinner and went shopping. It was so great. I love the fact that I can go out with my roommate and have a great time. It makes it so much easier that we are friends. Tonight we went to party. It was pretty fun.

Well coming home was much needed but also a un-needed stress. I needed to come home and see my parents. I missed home. It feels good to be sleeping in my own bed. I enjoy walking around the house without my shoes on and relaxing in a quiet environment. It's relaxing to be home again. No one is bothering me to do anything. I sat down for an hour and a half without an interruption; it was awesome! I spent another hour studying later without an interruption. That never happens in the dorms!
But the stress comes from this damn hurricane! I almost had to leave earlier tonight so I wouldn't get stuck here. I have a test Monday morning that I have to take so I can't get stuck here. Right now the plan is to leave at 4 tomorrow. Hopefully it will be calm enough to leave then or maybe not too much later. If I have to I'll leave later but I want to make it back to campus at a decent hour to finish up studying for my test on Monday. I've spent 2.5 hours studying for it already. It was great. Hopefully I'll do better on this test than on my biology test. 
I ate lunch with Lynn today. It was great to talk to her and see her again. I miss all my friends from home. Now I'm afraid that I won't get to go to mass tomorrow and lunch with everyone cuz this damn storm. I miss 10:30 mass so bad it's ridiculous. I miss St. Matthew more than anything. I was really looking forward to going to mass and seeing everyone. Otherwise I will hardly get to see anyone while I'm here. I was counting on seeing everyone at church this time around. I didn't tell anyone else I was coming home because I wanted to get all my work done which is slowly happening. Slowly being the key word. Trying to get reading and homework for an entire week done in one weekend is proving to be more difficult than I first thought. Wow this has turned into lots of rambling so I'm going to stop now. I actually miss school too. They're on lockdown tonight. I'm missing all the fun with that and Dante's girlfriend being there. I miss eating every meal with my friends. I miss walking down the hall or up the stairs to talk to friends and take a study break. I didn't think I would miss the place but I didn't think I would be happy to see Polk County again either. Things are so unexpected! and it sounds like it's getting windy outside already. Hurricanes are soo not fun!! Now this time I'm really going to stop typing and go read and then go to sleep in the hopes that I can go to mass in the morning!"

"event","Yesterday I went to hear the Dalai Lama speak. He was on campus the 20-22 and he did a special audience on the 22 for the UM community. It was really cool. He is such a cute little old man! I wanted to just hug him! He had a really positive message and outlook on life and the future. Kinda a nice thing to hear. Then I had to take my first Bio test. I thought I did well until I looked at my grade today for the multiple choice part. I missed 7 out of 30. Now the highest score i can get is an 82.7. Not what I was hoping for. It's really frustrating because 1)  I actually studied for like 3 hours for that test 2) I thought I did well and 3) it's biology! my favorite and best subject. If I can't make an A in biology I suck at life and need to find something else to do with my life. It's horrible. It makes me so angry. My only consolation is that I'm going home tomorrow after classes for the entire weekend! It makes me sooo happy! I get to eat real food, I don't have to wear shoes in the shower, and I get to sleep in my queen size bed! Too bad I'm going to miss the drama surrounding this weekend. Dante's ""girlfriend"" is coming for the weekend so Clay is sleeping in my bed while I'm gone. There's going to sooo much tension between Robyn and everyone. She can't decide if she likes Clay or Dante. It's going to be great and I'm going to miss it! Oh well. I bought Incubus tickets yesterday for Tuesday. Dana, Dante, Clay, Me, Leanne, and someone else are all going. It's going to be soo much fun! I can't wait! Well the football game is starting and I have more work to do. Hope to see some of you this weekend! After 10:30 mass whoever is there is invited to lunch afterwards before I head back to UM! Hope your there!"

"event","Last night was a really horrible night. I basically got publically degraded in front of all my new friends. This guy is a comlete jerk. I couldn't believe it. All my guy friends who were with me all wanted to kill him but it still didn't erase how I felt. It was the worst feeling ever. I can't even face the kid today. He's so horrible. I couldn't believe anyone could say anything with as much hate as he had in his voice. I felt lower than low. And I hed just gotten to where I was really starting to really like it here. I finally felt like I made the right decision in coming here and I wasn't that homesick all the time. He erased all that. Last night I was really considering waking up in the morning and driving home for the weekend. I just wanted my mom and all my old friends. But today at the game I met up with Lizzy and got to talk to her for a bit. It made me so incredibly happy to see her. No one knows how happy that made me. It's just what I needed after last night. But I'm kinda over last night. I'm still a little bruised and broken but I'll heal. We killed in the football game today. Tonight I'm super tired so I'm staying in tonight. In a bit I'm gonna attempt to do something for classes on Monday, I don't know what yet but I need to get something accomplished. It'll feel like such a waste of a day if I do no homework at all. I can't do that. I have too much to do."

"event","So yesterday was great. Actually the weekend was pretty great. Friday night was the football game and we won. After the game we hung out in Dante and Clay's room for a bit. Saturday I did a bunch of my homework and then went to Guitar Center and Circuit City with a bunch of my guy friends. I got Taco Bell for taking htem so it was all good. Saturday night I went to the holiday inn with some people to party with the Aussies (they live there cuz the dorms are overbooked). I hung out with a guy there that I had met last weekend during the hurricane. When we all got kicked out of the Aussies' room some people came back to our room to hang out and he was one of them. He didn't leave until 10am the next morning. We talked and stuff until really late (like 5) and we both just fell asleep off and on until like 6 when we were both wide awake again and started talking and stuff again until 8 and then we fell back asleep and he woke up and left at 10 and I slept until 12. We had breakfast together and went to the beach at 2 for a few hours. And we went to dinner together with a bunch of people/ So basically I spent the whole weekend with him. And I'm about to go hang out with him again tonight becuase I finished all my work for tomorrow :). It's just really great. I got to go to the beach and do my reading for engligh while lying on the beach in the beautiful florida sun. It made me so happy. It was a beautiful day and the water felt great. And I was there with Dana. Well gotta go! Dana's gonna be here soon!"

"event","Last night was easily the most enjoyable night I've had here at UM yet. And it was nothing special and nothing planned. I came up from the 7th floor and heard some people talking next door so I went in and stayed until 4 am. At one point there was 15 of us in the room just hanging out. The greatest part of the night was when the guys started playing their guitars. It started with one guitar and shortly after there were 3 guitars and one bass. It was great. We were all singing and laughing and having a great time. I talked to this one guy for a while too. He was really nice. It's easily one of the best conversations I've had since I've been here. I met some of thie kids from Australia and talked to them too. They were teaching Kate how to speak Aussie. It was sooo funny. It was really fun.
We got off of lockdown at 10 this morning. They kindly woke us all up to tell us this. We decided to go play volleyball after we all got up and ate lunch at like 1. That wasn't such a good idea. We all got soaked cuz it kept raining and we all had sand stuck to us everywhere. So now everyone's still inside even though we're not on lockdown. Everyone has finally decided to do their homework. The thing is though that I really don't have any. I had already done my homework for my Thursday class and I really only missed one class on Friday. And I already did half of my reading for that class today. I already did my work for my Tuesday class too. So I really have nothing to do but I'm still quite content because of last night. I would go to mass but it's really rainy still and I don't wanna walk across the muddy IM fields in the raind to mass. So I'm just gonna hang out here and hopefully find someone to talk to and hang with tongiht. My roommate is finally coming back tonight. So it definitely won't be quiet in my room anymore. Nick was such a better roommate for the weekend than she was. LOL. Hope everyone is safe from the hurricane!!"

So far it's been really fun here during the ""hurricane""(it's in quotes because nothing has happened yet.) Earlier today I layed out on the field with like half the school and tanned because it was so nice out. After 7p we got locked in the building so we have been playing cards, volleyball, musical pillows,and other interesting things to occupy ourselves. At this point though we're all getting kinda tired and are going our separate ways for the night. The outlook though is bleak. We're going to be locked down all day tomorrow, we can't even go to the dining hall to get food. When/If the winds get strong enough our floor has to move to floor 2 so we all kinda have some sort of bag packed with some clothes and toiletries to get us through a possible 24 hour period down there. But it hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be. We have all bonded alot and it's been fun. I hope everyone else is staying safe! Love you guys!"

"event","So I'm staying at UM for the hurricane. My roommate went to someone's house for the weekend near Hollywood, FL and Nidhi and her roommate both went home. Half the girls on my floor are gone. It's SUPER quiet around here. I did my laundry here for the first time. It wasn't horrible but it was annoying. Tomorrow afternoon we're going to be on lockdown and I'm going to have to move to a lower floor. (7-12 have to move to 1-6 when the winds get over 45 mph). So I don't know where I'm going to go. I don't really know anyone on those floors. One girl from 2 played ultimate frisbee with us the other night but I don't remember her name. I know where she lives though. One of Nidhi's friends on 2 left with her and maybe I could crash in her room. I really don't know though. We'll see how it all plays out. Right now it's all sit and wait. Which is really annoying. If I wanted to I could get all my reading done but I won't remember what I read by the time I get to class on Tuesday or Wednesday. What I really wanna know though is if we are going to have the football game Monday. They are making an announcement at 5 today. I hope we still have the game. I can't wait for it. But I need to go grab some food before the dining hall closes for the night! Hope everyone stays safe through yet another hurricane! Love you all!"

I already got hit by one this summer and that was enough for me. But now I have to decide if I wanna go home or stay here. My mom said to wait and see what the storm does. Which sounds like a good plan. On Thursday I will also know if they are going to cancel classes from noon on and on friday. So basically I have to figure out where the dumb thing is going and if I'm going to have class before I can decide anything. Which is really annoying I might add. So not only fo I have to worry about classes I also have to worry about this hurricane and what I have to do when/if it comes. It is truely annoying. But other than that everything is well. I played ultimate frisbee with Dante and some of his friends tonight. That was lots of sweaty fun. Well I need to do some things for classes tomorrow! </FONT></P>"

"event","I've learned one BIG lesson around here already. Weekends suck becuase there is too much down time and you get REALLY homesick. I spent most of Saturday reading for my classes and I was pretty homesick by the end of the day, but I went to dinner with Nidhi, Dante, and Clay and had a good time. Sunday was going good until I went to mass. Mass was great but afterward everyone was hanging out and talking and it reminded me soooo much of St. Matt's that I had to run away as fast as I could. I wanted to be back at home and at youth group with all my friends sooo bad it was unbearable. I was so homesick I didn't know what to do. I hung out with Nidhi for a bit and then Dante, Clay, Chris, and some other guys too, but as soon as I was back by myself I was unbelievably homesick again. But today I'm better. It's just spending so much downtime alone that got me down I guess.
I got to go snorkeling on Sunday morning. It was pretty fun. Kinda frustrating though because I'm a horrrible free diver so I was stuck on the surface all the time. It is definitely easier to SCUBA and less tiring. The water was sooo flat and I still got tired. Highly annoying. 
But now I must finish my bull crap english paper about who i am and read some stuff for class! Miss you all so incredibly much you will never know!"

"event","Okay so a couple of days ago I was really starting to get down about things. I completely realized how important my faith was to me and being around people with similar morals and values as myself. I hadn't really met too many people in that boat with me. I really wasn't too sure if I was going to get involved with ministries on campus until I started feeling that way and I was like WHOA I really need to find something to do about this. So I go to Canefest where all the organizations are recruiting people and I signed up for some of the ministry stuff and got pretty happy. Last night I went to one of the meetings for them. And we sang Praise and Worship. And it made me sooo happy. I am still in a good mood becuase of that meeting. And I called Alex and we went out last night too. I love Alex. We talked for like 2 hours like it was nothing. It made me soo happy. So now I'm in a really great mood and can take on the world at this point. My classes sem to be ok. I've already done my reading for my classes tomorrow and wrote a paragraph of my paper that is due on Tuesday. Things couldn't get any better...Well actually they could I mean I could have a room to myself and have a nice shower and a good, real meal but that can't happen, but given the situation things are good!"

"event","My time here so far has been really fun, entertaining, interesting, and other words that I can't think of on 3.5 hrs of sleep. But last night had to be the most interesting night so far. There was a salsa party on campus so a bunch of people were going to that. At the picnic Robyn (my roommate) and I convinced Dante to go with us. After my ironing his shirt that he had picked out he went to the gym and such because we still had several hours before it started. So he shows up at like 8:30 and is like I'm locked out of my room. So he used our cell phones to get a hold of his roommate to let him in the room. In this time we had told him that we would come dress him for the party just call us and let us know when he would get out of the shower. So he shows up in our room when he gets out of the shower in short little yellow running shorts. Robyn and I were laughing histerically and all the girls in the hall were like why is there a naked boy running around our floor. So Robyn and I go down and get him dress (he looked amazingly hot I might add) and we went to the salsa party long enough to decide that it was boring so we decided to go to Quench (a club in Coconut Grove) where they were having an official welcome back party. So after waiting in like 30 minutes to get in and paying a $10 cover charge we get in there and find out that it is boring too. We stayed for like 30 minutes and Dante wanted to walk around the Grove for a bit so we did. We ran into another girl on our floor and the guy she was with and his roommate and told them we were going to walk around for a bit and then leave but if they called us we would give them a ride. So at like 12:30 we get to the car and drive around close the the club and pick up the guy and Natasha (the girl from my floor).They didn't know where his roommate was. So we had 5 people in my little car. We got back to school and they were all talking about playing strip poker which I REALLY didn't want to do for sooooooooooo many reasons. So Dante gets up to our room and immediately climbs up in Robyn's loft. She eventually climbs up there too. Still in her mini skirt. Dave (Garret's roommate magically shows up and Natasha and Garret join us in our room as well. Robyn climbed up into her bed with Dante and Garret and Natasha were underneath in the chair and on the rug watching Finding Nemo and Dave and I were sitting on my bed watching the movie as well. Eventually Robyn takes off her overshirt and Dante's shirt ends up off as well after much flirting and wrestling over various things. Garret and Natasha are in their own little world. Dave eventually leaves and Dante leaves soon after without his shirt. He comes back for his shoes and Robyn eventually brings him back his shirt. Garret and Natasha left at like 2:40ish. So I ended up going to sleep at about 3. And this morning I woke up at like 8:30 and couldn't go back to sleep so I took and shower and am now writing this. So Robyn met Dante while she was walking around his floor the other night (Sunday) I called her to see where she was and I ended up going down there as well. We hung out with him and his roommate Clay most of the night. We ended up going to blockbuster to rent a movie but Robyn and I ended up buying 4 DVDs and we didn't watch a single one of them. Robyn and I both think Dante is hot and like him. (He's Italian and tall, enough said right?) We basically had said if he ends up with one of us it's cool, but he has to make that decision there will be no asking on our part. So after he forgot my name Sunday night I figured my chances were slim. But we still flirted all the time on Monday so I thought maybe not. But once again he ended up in Robyn's bed last night. I don't think anything happened but I can't be sure because I really can't see up there and I was dozing off too. So I really don't know. 
Last night in the car Garret said something about how he felt like he was a resort and that it's going to be really hard to go to classes and stuff like that. I felt the same way. There's so much to do and it's so beautiful. There's at least one party everynight. We've had 2 barbeques. Hopefully once classes start it'll calm down a bit on campus and it will be easier to focus on class and stuff like that. 
Speaking of classes I got my schedule Sunday. I hcae alright classes I guess. Bio, Marine Science, English, US history, and freshman experience. I'm really excited though because my marine science lab is at the Rosential school on Key Biscane. It's the Marine and Atmospheric science campus and labs. I didn't think I would get to go there freshman year. And next Saturday is a snorkel trip! I've already bought some of my books. I need to go to the used book store across US 1 to see if they have my oceanography book used. Here they only have new. I have a English books to buy too but I have to go to class first to see what books my professor will use. Well I think I'm going to go grab some breakfast."

"event","So ya I moved into my dorm today. It was soo much easier than I thought it would be. I had soo much stuff though but I got it all in the cart in one trip basically. Now my parents are gone too. So it's really cool. I've just been hanging out with Nidhi pretty much. There isn't too much to do right now. I'm pretty well settled in my room and everything so it's great."

"event","I am in love with every single power person that worked to restore power to my area! I FINALLY got power today at about 4. The past few days have been quite interesting... But nonetheless I am extreamly happy and content. But you know what makes me mad? I wanted to try to volunteer tomorrow for a relief effort and I called the red cross and I can't help with them because I'm not trained. I can't find any other organization in the area that I can help with. I settled for giving blood but it's really annoying. They keep talking about how they need volunteers and now I know why! It's impossible to find an organization to help with for the day. I have a lot of stuff to do in the next days anyway with leaving and all. So I guess it's kinda a blessing in disguise so I can get my things done. I haven't really been thinking about that until today really...so many other things to think about. I haven't really talked to Ervin since our conversation. I think we both know what we have to do and then Charley happened. I guess it's good. We're moving in different directions already."

"event","We've survived Hurricane Charley! We still have no power but dad bought a generator yesterday so I have power to use the computer and I get to watch TV. The fans in the windows make a HUGE difference too! It's been an experience without power for over 3 days. Lots of time to think and sleep. We're very thankful that our home wasn't that damaged and that we're alive and well. When we get power I may go volunteer somewhere to help other people. I want to be able to come home and sit in air conditioning and take a hot shower before I go and do that sort of thing first. Everyone is ok. All my friends and I were calling each other all day on Saturday making sure everyone was ok. We've been helping out our neighbors. When we went to Lakeland Sunday we bought 5 bags of ice and gave away 3 of them to neighbors. Things are still pretty crazy around here though. I waited over an hour to get gas yesterday and 40 minutes to get lunch at Taco Bell. Saturday the entire town seemed to be at Sonic because it was one of the only places open. The line wrapped around the building and all the stalls were full. Today I'm going to plug in the microwave and make easy mac! I'm so happy to be able to make east mac. I never thought I would be happy to be able to make easy mac. I've hardly been able to think about moving on Friday! I have to start packing and all sorts of things before Friday!! AAAHHH!! This hurricane has destroyed all my plans to spend time with my friends and take my time packing. I have to figure out how to do laundry before I leave if we don't get power soon. I need to find some boxes to put stuff into. I need to figure out what clothes and how many clothes I'm bringing. And right now it's too hot to do anything. By the time it's cool it's too dark to do anything! Right now it's just really frustrating. Supposedly we're supposed to get power today but who knows. At this point I don't care anymore. I can figure something out. I'm going to Erin's today to take a hot shower. I haven't taken a hot shower since Thursday! (Yes, I've taken showers. They've just been cold and dark.)"

"event","OK so... I totally realized that my job gives me an opportunity to be Christ to hundreds of people in one day of work. I get to talk to so many people while I'm at work. The smile I offer to every customer may be the only smile they get that day. And a smile can make a world of difference in any situation. I wish I would have realized this earlier since Thursday is my last day but today was a good day to realized it because the store was SSSSUUUPPPEEEERRRR CRAZY! Everyone is getting prepared for Hurricane Charley. But I greeted each customer with a smile and talked to them. I think today is the most talkative I've ever been with my customers. Work actually wasn't bad today and it was totally because I gave my day to Him. I really wish I would have thought of this earlier. I guess I got off track...
I finally had ""the conversation"" with Ervin tonight. You know, the one where we talk about what's going to happen when I leave for UM in like 8 days. God totally worked through Joey to make that one happen. We didn't make any decisions about what we're going to do but at least we talked about it. We let each other know what we were feeling. I feel better now that we talked about it. The conversation was totally filled with a lot of silences because we both really don't know what to do. It really was a good conversation until his uncle yelled at me because Ervin hadn't trained yet. I haven't gotten yelled at by my parents in forever. It really ticked me off but oh well. Take the good with the bad right? 
I really realized how scared I am. This whole leaving thing is WWWWAAAAYYY harder than I thought it was going to be. All the time Erin, Elizabeth, and I kept talking about how we are all going down south and are going to be an hour apart and it'll all be okay. But there are so many other people that I won't be that close to and that I don't talk to that much but are still cool to hang with. Who knows if or when we'll talk or hang out again. And the longest I've ever been away from my parents is like 10 days. I know I'm gonna get homesick. The closer the 20th gets the more scared I get. I don't know what's going to happen with that. I think that's the worst part of all this. I don't know. I've been saying that soo much lately. But it's true I guess. I really don't know. Donna says that fear comes from the Devil. I really need to give my fears up to God. I know I'll feel so much better about everything. And tomorrow I'm going to approach work the same way, because it's totally going to be worse than today was. It's my last day anyway. Gotta make the best of it right? I guess I did accomplish my goals today. yay for me!"

Yea I've recorded my thoughts and my actions since I've started posting but I haven't seen God in all my thoughts, feelings, and actions. Everything we do should be for the glory of God and this journal has no mention of Him at all. Everything that breathes should praise Him and this journal doesn't do that at all. I'm sorry everyone for wasting your time. I'm sorry that I have wasted my own time. From now on I'm going to try to post for His Glory and His Honor. I give this day to Him. I'll post later and tell you how that goes...Hopefully it won't be horribly disappointing."

"event","I leave in like 10 days and it seems like everytime I talk to someone they are like ""Bye! Good luck if I don't see you again!"" I really am starting to freak out about having to say goodbye to everyone. I just have this aversion to saying good-bye. I don't like the idea of maybe not seeing someone ever again. I made it through graduation and the end of the year without crying but right now all the time I like wanna cry because everyday someone is sayin bye in case they don't see me again. I'm really not lookin forward to church this Sunday because it's my last mass before I leave. I've grown up in that church and now I have to leave... There are so many people at church that I love and that are like family to me. I probably won't see half of them before I leave because eveyone goes to different masses and stuff like that. I'm really looking forward to seein everyone that's goin to adopt me into their church but I'm still going to miss St. Matthews and my family there. To make matters worse it's Fr. Ruse's last months here too. After Christmas he'll be gone and then who knows what will happen at my home church and stuff like that. Things aren't supposed to change! I'm supposed to be able to come home and everything will be the same! doesn't he know that! lol! I think I'm overreacting but that's how I feel sometimes.  I just hope I get to spend time with those close to me before I leave and don't loose contact with them when I'm gone. But I also hope I make a whole bunch of new friendships that will last forever too! But I am happy because I've already started to make plans to see people. I'm going out with Lynn and Nidhi is getting a bunch of people together at her house too. I hope I'm able to go out one night with Dani, Erin, Nidhi, Ervin, and others too. We all want to go dancing once before we leave. But Erin doesn't come home til Sunday and Dani leaves like Thur. So we only have a couple of nights to try to get that worked out. I'm soooo happy I don't have to work next week because it will leave me plenty of time to see people and pack which is one thing I haven't even started doing! AAAAHHH! another stress! oh well! It'll all be worth it!"

"event","Yea..nothing much to write about today so this post is mostly to waste some time. That seems to be all I've been doing lately. I've had a lot of time to do nothing it seems becuase I don't go into work until late in the day so I have entire afternoons to waste away rotting my brain watching t.v. It really sucks. I feel so lazy. Today at work I worked with Greg for the first time all summer (he just came back after surgery). I always liked Greg. He's really cool and funny. We were messin around as always and one of the other guys was like ""why don't you two get it over with already and screw."" I was like um....ok.... I know we flirt and that's not good because someone is going to say something to Ervin and it's going to get all twisted and just turn into a big mess. I hope that doesn't happen but I have this feeling...Greg's a cool guy and I like working with him, What's wrong with that right? I work with him tomorrow too, but Ervin will be there too. So he can see that nothing happens with his own eyes. I've been thinkin a lot lately (a by product of having to waste time) about my relationships with people. Like why one falls apart, why one is the way it is, and another one isn't like that one, and what they are based on. I've kinda been thinking about what ones I really wanna take the time to maintain when I go away and ones that I want to let fall apart because they aren't healthy or something like that. Other relationships I can't help but think man I wish I would have gotten to know this person sooner so we could've hung out more before I leave. Like Ervin and I have been together almost 4 months. I don't know if I want to maintain a long distance relationship through college. I want to be able to fully experience everything about my freshman year. I know that if we had been together more long term I wouldn't think twice about trying to maintain it. It's not like I'm never going to come back home. But it's only been 4 months. Is that worth trying to maintain and risk being held back by my feelings my freshman year? I don't want to completely drop our relationship though. I mean even if I don't want to maintain the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship I'll still want to be friends and hang with him when I come home. I'm just afraid that if we stay together that when I go out I'll feel guilty that I'm going out without him or that I won't talk to guys because I'll feel guilty. Little stuff like that. I don't know. I just want to have a good time in college and not have to worry about things like a boyfriend back home. But my heart keeps tellin me that it's wrong to break up with someone because of a bullcrap reason like going to school. I've seen way to many realtionships fail because of it. But everyone changes when they go away whether they want to or not. People grow, normally in different directions. Oh well I guess I'll go waste some more time overthinking everything while watchin t.v! Sorry for makin you guys read this stuff. It seems to be the same stuff over and over again."

"event","Today was pretty much a lazt day... I didn't want to do ANYTHING! I barely made myself get out of bed to go to church. I came home a slept again pretty much until I had to go to work. And worked sucked like always. After work though I went to Jon's house to hang out with him, Nidhi, Danielle, Nickie, and Kelley. It was fun. I forgot how much fun it was to hang out with them. I realized how short our time left here is too. Kelley's already been taking classes up at UF and we all leave a few days apart. Who knows when we'll all be in town at the same time and able to get together again if ever. Kinda a scary thought...
My dream last night was weird! A bunch of people from church were hanging out and James showed up. I was like freaking out and we have each other the biggest and longest hug ever. He went around to the rest of the people and said hey to them and stuff and he came back to me and we talked for a while and then he went to Kelli Fergers and taked to her. He was totally trying to hook up with her and I called him on it. And we was like I would try to hook up with you but you're taken. It was freaky!! I know that we always had a thing for each other. If I didn't like him at one point, he liked me and visa versa. I haven't talked to him in sooo long though. The dream made me realize how much I do miss him and the convesations over ice cream that we used to have. I know I'm going to miss little things like that with all my friends. I need to let them go AI guess. Everything can't always be the same. People grow, they change, they leave, everyone has to move on I guess. I think I've told that to Lynn a hundred times; time for me to listen to my own advice i guess!"

"event","Islands of adventure wasn't a bad time, but it wasn't great either. We had bad karma going against us from the start. First I couldn't find my keys then it took like 2 hours to get there. We got in line for the Hulk (supposedly 75 minute line) and they were experiencing ""technical difficulties"". I don't know how long we waited in line there. Then we went on the log water ride thing. I didn't got COMPETELY soaked but close to it. That was another hour + line. Then we watched the bike and skateboard stunt show that was really cool. Then the weather started to go bad. It got pretty cloudy and started to sprinkle as we walked to Dueling Dragons. We rode fire in the light rain and then got back in line for ice. Meanwhile it started raining harder. By the time we got off that line it was pouring. we ran to the Suess land place in the rain and waited it out for an hour. It slowed down enough for us to head to the car. As soon as we got to the garage it started to pour AGAIN. I was soo cold and wet the entire way home which again was over 2 hours. It was crazy. I forgot how good a hot shower could feel! It was a fun day though. I'm happy I went. 
Work this next week is going to suck. I have to close Sun-Thursday. But Thursday is my last day at Publix! I'll be done there forever (hopefully). Next summer I'm going to try to find a job somewhere else but I can probably get a job back there pretty easily. Well I'm sooo tired so I'm heading to bed!"

"event","First I would like to say thank you to everyone who called, IMed, e-mailed, or posted and told me happy birthday. It may my day brighter and made me feel very loved and special. :) So today was pretty much a normal day but with presents. I got the mail and got some cards with money in them. I used the cash to get my nails done so hopefully they'll grow because I can't bite them. Then I stopped by the bank a deposited the check. I eventually went up and bought a couple of scratch off tickets because I can but they were both losers. I went to dinner with my parents and Ervin. My food was pretty good but the service was bad and my parents really didn't like their food. But oh well. But it was a pretty good day. The other day when my parents took my car they got my windows tinted. It's super great but I can't roll down my windows until Sunday so that they can dry or something. It's SUPER annoying. Ervin got me a CD I had been wanting for a while which is really cool and a gift card to PacSun (one of my favorite stores). My parents also got me a straightener for my hair which is super cool because you can use it on wet hair too. Ervin's Godparents got me this really cool ring for my birthday. I about crapped in my pants when I found out how much it cost though! I wish they wouldn't have spent that much money on me! I hate when people spend money on me. For some reason it makes me feel guilty or something. I don't konw. But overall it was a good day just because of everyone taking the time to wish me a happy birthday I guess. Tomorrow should be fun too! Ervin is taking me to Islands of Adventure. Thanks again guys! I love you!"

"event","Wow! I'm totally addicted to posting in this journal! And to reading all my friends' journals. Everytime I read someone's journal I learn more about them and I feel like I get to know the real them...It's really neat. I found some more journals on Xanga. I wish I could post on them without joining...eventually I probably will join so I can post on Janna's and KP's because I totally miss them and love them tons! (can't wait to see you guys!) I got bored today so I decided to make dinner tonight! I went to the store (twice) and got eveything I needed and it was SUPER good. My cheese enchilladas were a big hit once again! I gave Ervin and Joey some too and they loved them along with my parents...So now I know my parents aren't lieing when they say they like them...LOL! I felt soo accomplished after I cooked. I felt like a real adult with dinner on the table when my dad got home from work. It was an interesting feeling...
Oh my parents are TOTALLY planning something for my birthday. Today my mom was like you might have to take my car to work tomorrow and I was like why? and she just said we may have something planned for your car tomorrow. Last week my dad said he may have to borrow my car on Friday. But he has to work that day but not tomorrow. I wonder what they are going to do...Birthdays are so under celebrated at my house. We sometimes just get a cake and we always go out to dinner. That's it. A card or two. Presents maybe. No big deal. Just another day. But you know what?? I always look forward to my birthday dinner. It's always fun. Last year my mom, Erin, Nikki, and I went to Carrabbas. This year my parents, Ervin, and I are going to Hops. I don't know why I enjoy my birthday dinner so much. It's never anything special. Just dinner out. I guess becuase it's my birthday and I get a little bit more dressed up or something. I don't know. It's kinda weird.  I'm kinda tired and still really full of my good food I made so I think I'm going to head to bed now...Thanks for reading this guys. I love you all! Thanks for all your comments. They always make me smile!"

"event","All night I've been catching up with friends. I've realized I really need to do that before I go through this HUGE change that's about to happen in like 18 days. It was really great. I can talk to different people about different things. Like I talked to Danny about moving and college and Lynn and her boys like we used to and Borris about St. Leo and soo many different things. John sent me a funny video, totally making me laugh like he used to. I wish I could talk to everybody about everything. But everyone can't relate to my feelings about leaving and going to school like Danny and stuff like that. Like when I talk to Ervin about leaving it's hard to be excited because of what we have. It gets really depressing and he doesn't know about all my anxieties like others becuase he's going to go to school local and is living at home and doesn't have to leave everything like me. I can't talk to him about St. Leo becuase he's never been there and doesn't know how incredibly awesome it is. But I can talk to him about work. No one else knows what a jerk Bill can be and how anal Mr. Fountain is. Sometimes it feels like we don't talk enough. Like there's always something to talk about but is it worth talking about...Is it meaningful conversation? or just extended small talk? We never have awkward silences...If it's silent it is totally comfortable. I guess that's really cool. We can sit on the swing bench and not say anything and I still feel really great about the time we spent together...just savoring the moment of being together. I don't know. I really like talking to people. It's the best way to get to know someone. After one conversation you can feel incredibly close to someone. One of the greatest ways to pass the time is it just chill with someone and talk forever. I love talking to people!! So if I've talked to you lately you've made my day and I love you soo much! I feel soo much closer to you after each conversation we have. I hope I continue talking to everyone..I don't want to lose touch with everyone that has made me who I am up til now when I go to college. I still want to be the same person. Some people go to school wanting to change alot and I really like the person I am right now...I don't want to change. There maybe a few little things here and there but there isn't a huge change I want to make. I am very secure with who I am. I know who I am. I'm totally just writting everything that comes to mind. I just wanted to have this short little post because I was so happy I talked to people I hadn't talked to in a while and now it's turned into this long rambling thing of mine. So God Bless you if you're still reading this. You must be really bored or something. Maybe that's one little thing I can change...I'll stop rambling. But I'm getting out all these things that I've been thinking about and it feels really good. I totally felt like I accomplished things this morning. I washed my sheets for my dorm but then I finished my senior memory book. I put pictures in it. And then I got all artsy fartsy and I took all my graduation cards and made a collage of the pictures and messages in the cards and then cut all the signatures out and added them. It is really neat and it takes pieces of all the cards I got. It's really neat! And tomorrow I'm going up to LRHS to get my yearbook. I can't wait to see all the pictures and have all the memories come flooding back again like they did today when I was putting the pictures in my album. I really did have a good time in high school. I'm sooo happy I met Erin and Elizabeth freshman year. They are the greatest friends I could have ever hoped to make. We have so many great memories together. Like all the random things that happen whenever we try to go out. Pizza Connection. Concerts. Daytona Beach ;). Universal tirps. City Walk. Carrabbas. They are all great memories...too many to mention. Erin and Elizabeth are across the highway from each other in the fall and I'll be like 1 and a half- 2 hours away so hopefully we can still hang out and continue the crazy times in college :). I've been randomly writing for like 30 minutes now so I think I'm going to stop...God Bless you if you're still reading this...If anyone is......"

"event","^^ Wow! Known as the stingiest person in my group of friends, I actually bought something EXPENSIVE at the Paul Frank warehouse sale today! It's a black comfy sweater with a white skull on it. Paul Frank fans will probably know what that thing is called, but since I'm clearly NOT a PF fan, I have no idea! In any case...


I LOVE MY SWEEEEEEEEEEATER!!

p.s. I also love my Mom for giving into paying for half of my sweater ^^"

"event","Today while browsing through my friend's online journals, I found a ""How Hong Kong Are You?"" quiz. It consists of 85, kind of stupid questions, but it's all in good fun, right?

By the way, having lived in Canada for the last half of my life (and of course in Hong Kong for the first half!), I scored a surprisingly high 69% ^^ And when I re-wrote the quiz for what I recognized to be stereotypical HK behaviors, I scored 96%. ^^ Guess I'm actually very HK-ly. 

Anyway, feel free to try out the <a href=""http://www.quizie.com/test.php?testid=299782"" target=""_blank"">fobby quiz</a>!"

"event","What if something you believe in does not hold true anymore? What if what you once thought was the right thing to do might be wrong? What if you find out that your thoughts hurt other people? What if your thoughts were wrong in the first place? What if you try to protect yourself, but find out that you're not the victim? What if by protecting yourself, you hurt the person you least want to hurt? 

What do you do in that situation?

What CAN you do?

...

...

And what if there's nothing you can do?"

"event","<font face=""arial"">Wow! After a month or so of neglecting this journal account, I have gotten around to customizing everything. It is pretty simple, just takes effort. I really would much rather SLEEEEEEEEP... only I can't, 'cause I have to work on my stupid English assignment and perhaps study for my Data test. 

Anyway, today I noticed once again that I have lost one of my textbooks. This time it's Data. It's just one of the many things I tend to lose... Hamlet textbook, English binder, my cute little pens, etc. I hate it when I lose things. >.< 

But, today, being one of my luckier days, I actually FOUND my data textbook. I left it in the classroom after class yesterday. How silly of me. -__________-""

*sigh* lets hope I don't lose any more things..."

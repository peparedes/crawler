I actually read all of you crazy posting flist people, by the way. I just didn't comment, becuase I'm a dirty whore like that. (aha, <lj user=""bonthra"">)

See? Bitch = me.

Anyway.

Guess who hates their job again? I'm so mad at myself; but I'm so tired and frustrated and I guess that means I just like to RUN AWAY  from shitty situations, because I can't seem to stay at my job. I've been there a year, on my birthday, actually. And I am making myself feel better by saying that the situation is unbearable. But meh. And then there is the whole looking for a new job thing.

I don't have any sills!

Ahahahah.

Seriously, though. I'm a college dropout that tried twice to go back and is now attemtping a third time this coming August; that has changed areas of studies three times and worked minimum wage jobs all her life.Except my current one. And teenagers can recite American history to me that I know nothing about. *cough cough* <lj user=""alliante""> *cough*  *looks away shiftily* And boy howdy, do I sound dramatic and angsty.

Ok, so, I'm really not all that unhappy. Just frustrated. I get paid nine bucks an hour to do the most physical job in the entire hospital, risk getting bitten and mauled everyDAY, while the people that sit on their ass all day and answer phones make 12/hr. Bastards.

But I love the animals. As hokey as that sounds; they are the only thing that gets me through the day. There is this lovely little rottweiler at work that just loves up on you and tries to CUDDLE, which is amusing, because hey, she is huge. Heh. 

And we have the best pit bulls ever. They rock. I've seen 3 aggressive golden retireivers, 2 black labs have bitten me, and the 6 pits that come to work on a normal basis are sweet as pie and playful as hell. So there everyone! How you raise your pet DOES matter.

And I'm done rambling now."

"event","So. Totally had this lovely Phantom dream last night. Weird, but LOVELY. It is as follows, clicky the cut so I don't make EVERYONE suffer.

<lj-cut text=""Christine's an idiot. Seriously."">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting: Approx. 1900--house near old hotel slash opera house.
Time of day: Randomly changes. Buwahaha.

Approx. 10 to 15 years after the disaster at the Opera House. I am Christine's best friend that is so not Meg, (because I have this gorgeous dark hair and look mighty fine in a corset, go me.), and we are sitting in a bedroom in some house, talking girlishly.

Christine is telling me how she ran away from Erik, (the Phantom, sillies), and went off and married Raoul. Except in this version she did not have any kids and eventually left Raoul cuz, let's face it, he's a pussy. I even remember the dialogue. Sort of.

CHRISTINE: *le sigh* And I left him and married <i> Raoul</i> *scornfulness*, and then left him too.
SEXY DARK HAIRED ME: *GIANT INCREDULOUS PAUSE* Wait. You left the Phantom for RAOUL?!. You stupid whoreslutbitch.

....Yeah. And she just sighed again, oh so depressed like. Not me. I was all determined to FIND him again, becuase damned if I wasn't going to pick up on her lost goods. And I felt bad for him. Yeah. So I drag her to the oh so convient hotel/opera house down the road. It is dark outside, and it is snowing prettifully. I have pretty snowflakes in my hair, and am all ""ooooh how lovely"" Whereas Christine is becoming more terrified by the moment.

Anyway, we get to the hotel thingy, and we check in to the hotel. Um. Cuz. That's the best way to find him; be all sneaky like. Anyway, Christine does not want to leave her room, but I make her, most likely because I am an evil bitch and I know the Phantom won't come unless she is around. We traipse around for a bit, and then I'm all ""OOOH! let's take a TOUR!"" And I squeal and point to the 'Opera House tours now"" sign somewhere in the hotel lobby. (Conveintly lit by a giant chandelier, aha.) At this point Christine runs off, and I skip of to take the tour. 

This guy leads us all around the opera house, even upstairs where it is dark and scary. At some point I hear 'someone' singing, and I try to go find out what's going on, but the tour director hisses at me and tells me not to be stupid. Bloody prat. 

The tour ends, and somehow I end up behind the opera house, in the snow, looking around. And then...

<i> There he is!!!</i> *fangirly squeal* Ahem. He is standing there, in a gorgeous cape and black suit, staring into the night and the snow falling around him wonderfully. Still wearing his mask, and definetly Movie!Phantom in all his glory.

I'm an idiot, so I walk towards him and touch his arm all soft like. At which point he turns on me and looks like he is about to give me the telling off of a century, but something stops him. (I'm just good like that.) Then, WHEE! He grabs my hand and runs me upstairs to his 'lair' which oddly consists of a bunch of beds. *innocently whistles.* Hey, I can't help what my subconscious thinks. Anyway, we talk for awhile and then we..uh..mess around for a bit, and then before anything really goes anywhere, he screws everything up and says: ""I always liked you better than Christine, you aren't as pretty as she is and would accept me and lalala."" Well, now I'M pissed. And I YELL at him and run off, hurt and angry and like a silly girl. Which I am.

I find Christine and tell her, and she goes off to find him, and I'm all jealous and pissed as shit. But then she comes back with him, looking scared again, and HE has his mask off, and he bends down and kisses me and is all ""Sorry.""

I accept his apology. >.>  Yeah. I'm a whore, what do you want? He KISSED me.

So then, a bunch of time passes, like, a year. And we are at the hotel again, me, ERik, Christine. We are watching someone sing, and I tell the Phantom he could do sooo much better, and he get's up there and sings and knocks their socks off. And meanwhile, Christine finds a 15 years older Raoul and is all lovey on him. Until he says something derogatory about the Phantom, at which point she slaps him in the face and says ""I though you had changed!""

Then, and this is MY favorite part: The Phantom gets down off stage, and his father walks in, who is none other than BILL FROM KILL BILL TWO!  Holy god. And Phantom takes that moment to PROPOSE to me, somehow making it all dark and desire like. Whoo!

Of course I say yes, and rub it in Christine's face and then we run off and get married and have lots of hot sex, whoo.

Ok, I made up that last part. Except for the me saying yes bit.

I'm so effing strange.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</lj-cut>

Beware my psychoticness and mega rambling. Apparently I have this deep seated and unknown bitterness and anger towards Christine Daae. Hunh."

DISCLAIMER: Do not read if you are squeamish about hints of Severus and Lucius love. Seriously. Don't come whining to me afterwards, all surprised. I'll just laugh at you. Really, it's just a kiss, (aha...), and then some foreplay imagery. And who doesn;t love that? Anyway, off with you, those who haven;t read it. I like it becuase it is so tragic.

There.

Now then, on to angst!

Blah.

Well, I'm feeling very Severus lately, and I know I've said that before, but really, right now it is true and just a stupid way for me to say that I am being incredibly sulky and non communative. Like, at work. But, everyone is being so disgustingly negative about EVERYTHING, lately, and i'm all,...err...can;t we just work and forget about the crap that everyone hates about eachother? But of course they can't. and really, neither can I, so who am I to ask them to?

But the doctor is an asshole and expects four people to love and cherish 100 dogs over the christmas weekend, and give them the care they deserve, and keep the ENTIRE hopsital clean, becuase his lovely technicians cant do that themselves, oh no, they might break a nail or something.

And then we are all stressed and it's become the entrie staff versus the girls who work in the kennel. Nevermind that we are all females and 20 plus females working together is NEVEr a good thing.

and....

Oh, I was all happy for this month becuase I though Ross and I could actually have a christm,as together this year. but, due to a schedule mix up, I will be opening at MY job, and he will be closing at HIS. which means, AGAIN, I will be ALL ALONE AT CHRISTMAS NIGHT. and he will be all alone for the day.

And I know this isn;t a big deal copmpared to the thousands of poor people who are much worse of this year, but goddamit, I'm a frail, weak human being and it makes me cry everytime i think about it.

And my grandfather is dying a little more every day and I thank god I got to see him a few days ago for my parents family christmas thing, and he feels he has to tie up all his loose ends and he was talking to me about it and all I could do was cry, cry cry.

and yes, I'm a jerk and I kept this all inside, because, my defense mechanism is to not tell anyone anything, becuase then -I- have to think about it, and I HATE talking about emotions over Im, which is how I speak to most of you, and I'm a bloody hypocrite and all.

And Mari, I havelt read your story yet, becuase I just got home a bit ago, but I am going to now, because I know it will CHEER ME UP."

"event","Awhile ago, there was a thingy going around about naming one's ""5 most interesting HP characters. "" Or, some such.  I'll do that now, cuz i'm bored. do not expect correct spelling or punctuation.

1) <b>Severus- </b> Come now, you all knew this. Why? Well, first of all, know I am refering to book snape, even if Alan Rickman is wonderful. Well. Anyway. He INTERESTS me. I mean. The man positively REEKS pf power, is a former death eater, very mysterious, but is still so incredibly bloody submissive.

It's craziness. And if you can read those glimpses of his past that the author has given us and still not feel bad for him, then you are a better person that I. Though, not really:-P

2) <b>Neville. </b> This actually surprised even me. but. Well. HIS parents both driven insane at the hands of Bellatrix, they might as well be dead. HE doesn't go around yelling and screaming and being angsty, does he? NO. And I love him for it. And I think we'll find he has a core of strength we aren't prepared for. The poor guy. There's so much in HIs past two, I want to know more and I want him to be more flushed out as a character.

3) <b> Narcissa Malfoy </b> Ha. SHE intrigues me. It's interesting to me, that she is so frequently portrayed as scheming conniving bitch in HP fandoms. Not to say that she isn't, either. But, she is mentioned so little, this wife of the Malfoy Lord. And SEEN so little. You just want to know, how DOES she put up with bloody Lucius? Haha, just kidding. Seriously, does she have the same calm, serene, sneering attitude he does? Would she die for her son? Hmmm? She is glittering and devastatingly intelligent, and the mother of a rahter devious little snot, and that is all we know. *sigh*

4) <b> Sirius Black </b> So many questions. Cried when he died. Or went beyond the veil whatever. B/c I'm pathetic and like so many others out there.  Anbd. Why? Why is He the rebel in the family? Why did he decide not to follow voldemort? Hmm? Why, if he was such a profound rebel, did everyone immediately think he was a Voldie follower? did he really hate his brother? 

And, come ON. Shaggy black hair? Tall, angsty past. Sarcastic, impulsive, great grinning idiot? Turns into a lovable black lab? How  could I NOT adore him?

5) It's a tie between Bella and Remus. Strange. but I couldn;t just keep either one of this list. Know it;s cheating. How did Remus get those scars?!  When did he get bit? And, Sirius/Remus love, of course.

And Bella....oh, Bella bella. Beautiful dark, powerful, strange, crazy bella."

It's like all of a sudden I am surrounded by idiots that want to blame all their little problems on ME.

<lj-cut text= ""Getting Away With Murder"">

Somewhere beyond hapiness and sadness
I need to calculate what creates my own madness
And I'm addicted to your punishment
And you're the master, and I am waiting for disaster

I feel irrational, so confrontational
To tell the truth I am getting away with murder
It is impossible to never tell the truth
But the reality is I'm getting away with murder

Getting away, getting away, getting away

I drink my drink and I don't even want to
I think my thoughts when I don't even need to
I never look back cause I don't even want to
And I dont need to, because I'm getting away with murder

I feel irrational, so confrontational
To tell the truth I am getting away with murder
It is impossible to never tell the truth
But the reality is I'm getting away with murder

Getting away, getting away, getting away
Getting away, getting away, getting away
Getting away, getting away, getting away
Murder

Somewhere beyond hapiness and sadness
I need to calculate what creates my own madness
And I'm addicted to your punishments
And I'm your master, and I am craving this disaster

""Disarm""

Disarm you with a smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
Ooh, the years burn 

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my choice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you

Disarm you with a smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left alone
Ooh, the years burn
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
And what I choose is my voice
What's a boy supposed to do?
The killer in me is the killer in you
My love
I send this smile over to you

The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you
Send this smile over to you
The killer in me is the killer in you

<lj-cut text="" Lyrics to Killer Queen"">

She keeps her Moet et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily ""nice""

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laserbeam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try ?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
(killer, killer, she's a Killer Queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild..
She's all out to get you

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try ?
You wanna try...

So. SEVERUS LOVES TEH LULU! It must be known. I'll make it up to you, somehow.

It smells like home outside today. Does that seem a wierd thing to say? I used to live up north you know. And while you can never replicate the snow that fell, the air had that crisp clean bite to it, finally.

Granted, it's Florida, so it won't get much colder than 40 degrees at night. *pensive sigh*

But today remineded me of home. Of when I was little and we'd stay out late and play Red Rover and Dead Ant Tag (we made that one up, we did) and hide and seek.

Or of when I was a bit older, 13 or 14, methinks, and we'd be outside in the same neighborhood, only this time it was just us girls and we talk about the silly things young kids do.

Except when it wasn't just us girls.

When we'd crush on the older guys who were taller and oh so mature, and they'd laugh and come outside in the dark and we'd still play red rover, for old time's sake. And we'd laugh when we got caught, tumbling to the ground, getting grass stains on our knees and being breathless again.

I miss feeling that way. I miss laying there, for a moment, watching my breath and the stars twinkle in the sky, before one of the older boys would ruoghly pull me to my feet, and we'd be running again.

I miss the way it feels to be silly, with your friends, to enjoy the outside, to wait for the snow to fall.


I miss the way it smells, at home."

And it had Voldie in it! hiyah!

So.

I'm like this undercover cop slash sorceress person. Yes. Looked just like me, only with cool magical powers. And I'm visiting this four house orpahange place, that is oddly out in a very large field. Only, I'm undercover, right, so it is actually an investigation/rescue mission b/c we've heard rumors that the orphans are getting mistreated. And also, it's a place for families without homes, not just orphans. And it's wierd.

People kept coming to me and asking me to save them, and I had to tell them not yet so I wouldn't blow my cover.

So the owners of the place tried to butter me up, and they had this big dinner with all the families and kids and made them act like they were happy.

But then the ceiling of the huuuge room we were in opens up and this mechanical snake dragon comes out and starts trying to eat us! Only it can't get into the very corners of the room, so everyone is hiding out there.

Yeah. So naturally I'm pissed off and I .....run outside. Yes. Don't know why. And it's dark now, and the roads have become these little bridges over swamp water and grass, and there are all these snakes, real ones, swimming around. It was scary. (I should have known  where the dream was going, at this point.) They kept hissing and trying to go on the bridge. So then I run BACk inside, yelling, telling the owners I'm going to SHUT THEM DOWN, and waving my suddenly appeared wand around like a weapon.

And then, <i>HE</i> showed up. There was Voldemort, floating around near the ceiling in his black robes, all a glitter and laughing evilly. Turns out he is the REAL owner of the orphanage. ( What is WRONG with my subconscious?!) And as he continues to cackle, get this chaps, a Hit Points bar appears beneath him, like all of the sudden we are in an RPG video game! 

So, I step up to the plate, and he zooms at me, all evil like. And he starts to ""Avada Kedavra,"" But before he even says it, I give this mysterious smile, (it's like i'm watching myself, now...), and then scream ""CRUCIO.""

I do this, over and over, yelling and pointing my wand.

And, it KILLS him.

And then I woke up.

So, everyone! That's how the Dark Lord REALLY dies.

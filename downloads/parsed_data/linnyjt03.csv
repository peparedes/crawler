"event","I know everyone probably knows this by now but I am getting a dog next year and I am so excited!  I don't know what kind yet but I am looking into it.  Any suggestions? I keep getting myself so excited because I look at all these puppies now and I can't get one til August.  But i think that if I absolutely have to I guess I could get it like a month early before I move into Woodbridge.  I dont think that would be a big deal.  We'll see, 
Also, my mom came down to b-town yesterday and we went to the outlet mall.  So much fun!  Especially since she bought me a ton of stuff!  Spring break clothes, purse, wallet, some kitchen stuff, a little step stool thingy for my room, some sweat pants that i am officially in love with...  I love my mom!  
I had to get up at 5am today because I had to open at starbucks.  Yay.  It was really busy of course.  Now i am totally pooped and I have homework to do.  NO!
The countdown has officialy begun!  2 WEEKS TO SPRING BREAK!  Now I have to start going tanning..lol.  I have been taking step classes and they are fun, I don't really expect to see results by spring break but I can always dream.  I'm excited about SB.  I hope its nice and warm there in florida.  At least 75 and I will be happy.  But then I will have to come back to this lovely place and it will be extra depressing.  I want spring!  It's my fav season.  
So I guess the Oscars are on tonight.  I would love to watch but I have homework.  Boo.  Maybe I'll be able to catch some later tonight.  But the bf is coming over so we'll see.  
That's all for now.
Peace out"

"event","Everyone can thank Jeffey for making my lj as beautiful as it is!  YAY

I just took my t206 midterm and there were only 7 out of 40 questions that I was iffey on so I think it went well.  Now I have to go to t101 and oh man I can't wait!  Then I have to work and it should be joyous since last night I took a step class and of all things my arms are sore so I probably won't even be able to lift up a gallon of milk.  Hopefully they will take it easy on me!

Peace Out"

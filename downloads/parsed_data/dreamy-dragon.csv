I've been on campus since 8:52am. It's a joy to spend some of my morning, all of my afternoon, and part of my evening on campus. I could be spending all that time at a much worse place, so I really shouldn't complain. 

I've been up since 4:03 am today. John got up to get a drink of water and I did too. When I got back in bed I tossed and turned until 5:30am. At that point I said to hell with it and got up. I watched the news (5:30-6am) and cartoons (6-6:30am). Followed that up by taking a shower and getting dressed for class. By this time it's 7am and I still have one hour and ten minutes until I leave the house. So I watched a rerun of Profiler. 

From the above writing, I think it's fairly obvious to tell that I'm really anal about time. I always note the time, but it's not in an anxious, 'we're two minutes late' kind of way. I just like time, I find it very interesting. 

I guess that's all I have to say for now. I have to go to the store, I need some index cards."

50 or less: Thanks for answering honestly. Now get yourself a shrink, quick!
51-70: When it comes to understanding human emotions, you'd have better luck understanding Chinese.
71-90: You've got more emotional intelligence than the average frat boy. Barely.
91-110: You're average. It's easy to predict how you'll react to things. But anyone could have guessed that.
111-130: You usually have it going on emotionally, but roadblocks tend to land you on your butt.
131-150: You are remarkable when it comes to relating with others. Only the biggest losers get under your skin.

I agree with the results. Though the results of the What's Your EQ (Emotional Intelligence Quotient)? and How Misanthropic Are You? seem like they would conflict. Then again, these are internet tests and should be taken with a grain of salt ^_^"

School is going well. Boring, frustrating, annoying, sometimes fun, but still it's going well. As for the group work situation, documentation is great. T.S. and I decided to document the lack of participation in our group. After seeing that Dr. D changed the nonproductive members grades. Yay for documentation!

I have some questions: 
1. Why can't people just get along? 
2a. Why is it when the road is gray there are white lines painted on it? 
2b. Do they not realize how hard it is to see the lines at night or bright sunlight? 
2c. Why can't all the road lines be painted yellow?

I can probably find the answers to questions 2a, 2b, and 2c, but question 1 is way out of my league. 

I'm done rambling for now. I'm off to find something fun to do before class starts in thirty-five minutes."

"event","It's been almost two months since my last update. That only goes to show how I haven't felt like/had the time to write anything lately. 

Now with the catching up on my life: 
1. I still hate group work. Only this semester I'm on the verge of being homicidal. I'm sure the world would thank if I were to take a club to the heads of some of my less productive group members. 

2. Spring Break is almost here! I would do cartwheels if I wasn't so sure that I would fall and seriously hurt myself--not to mention take out a few innocent bystanders. Nothing like collateral damage.

3. My brother is acting like an asshole again. It didn't take long this time to revert back to his old ways. Right now he's on this 'holier than thou' rampage. He's taken it upon himself to convert me since I'm such a heathen. I was all set to go off on him, but I decided not to worry about it. If he gets to be too much of a nuisance then I'll just block his e-mails and avoid his phone calls. 

I can't think of anything else >_< That is so lame...oh well. 

It's list time again. 

My Fears:
1. Snakes. I'm absolutely, positively, without a doubt terrified of snakes. It all started when I was five years old and stepped on a dead one. It didn't help that my brother and sister thought it was funny. They laughed at me while I ran home in tears. 

2. The dark. I think it's more of the unknown than the actual darkness. It doesn't help that I have an over active imagine. 

3. My sister. However, I'm getting over that fear. I'm sure if it ever came down to it and we did have a physical fight that I would be able to take her. I have almost two inches on her and a lot of repressed anger. However, I know that won't happen, because we've finally reached the point that we've become friends. 

4. Did I mention snakes already? I did, but it was worth mentioning twice. 

I want to start writing some more, but I can't find a decent beta! It's so frustrating! I love to write and I like to have people read it, but I don't want someone reading my work if it's full of errors. I'll try searching again and maybe I'll find a good one. I'll just have to see how things turn out. 

That's all for now."

"event","As I sit here procrastinating, instead of working on a story, I think about certain pairings that I like. 

<b><u>Pairings I Like, but Can't Find Any (or Much) Fanfiction About Them</u></b>

-A-ou/Un-ou--Kiddy Grade
-Bob/Chiaki/Masataka--Tenjho Tenge (By far my favorite threesome ever)
-Daisuke/Kia--Heat Guy J

<b><u>Pairings I Like, but Refuse to Write About
</u></b>
-Franz/Albert--Gankutsuou
-The Count/Albert--Gankutsuou
*I don't write about them, because I honestly don't see these pairings happening. At least not according to canon. By that I mean where can these people find time to have a relationship, much less have sex? It's usually because one of the characters dies that I feel this way. I don't know if I did a good job of explaining that >_<

I think that's all, or at the leat the main ones. I'll have to start writing about the pairings I can't find any fanfiction for. That would be a lot better than complaining about the situation and not doing anything about it. Not anytime soon though, I have a lot of other stuff to complete first. I guess that means I'll stop procrastinaing now and get back to work."

Tonight we drove around this fancy neighborhood and looked at their Christmas decorations. I was bored after the first block and ready to go home, but those two were really interested in it. Tomorrow we're supposed to go to the park and play football, go fishing, and have a picnic. However, there is a 60% chance of rain so that's probably not going to happen. If that's the case we'll have an indoor picnic and play video games. 

I started making icons again, so that should be fun. I've been saving images like crazy the past few weeks; it makes sense that I should finally do something with them. 

I guess that's all for now. It's kinda hard to write in my journal when I'm chatting with someone and trying to make icons at the same time. So much for multi-tasking ^_^"

"event","As today's title says, I went years without having to go through a window, because I was locked out of house. At least that was until yesterday. This is actually pretty funny, so go ahead and have a laugh at my expense ^_^ 

<lj-cut text=""try not to laugh too hard"">I was home alone Friday (just like today and part of tomorrow) and sometimes I get paranoid when I'm alone. So when I was taking a shower I locked the bathroom door. I knew the chances of something happening were slim, but I just like to be prepared...and paranoid -__- I did mention that one, right? So I showered, I dressed, and I got started on doing my hair, because within the next thirty minutes or so I planned on leaving. I had the urgent need to go the post office and to go buy wrapping paper and bows. But back to the funny story...So I'm constantly in and out the bathroom as I'm getting ready. After about fifteen minutes or so I thought I was done in the bathroom, so I closed the door. Only to realize that I hadn't put my lotion up. I went to put it away, which involved me turning the door knob (very important). However, when I turned the knob the door wouldn't open. I managed to lock myself out of the bathroom! I felt so stupid at the moment, because I didn't remember relocking the door after my shower. The way the door knob is I couldn't take the screws off and remove it all together. I couldn't use a knife to pry the lock loose. I did not want to break the door down. That one would have been hard to explain, but it also would have been lots of fun to do. My only option was to go outside and climb through the bathroom window. First I had to cut off the limbs of a very thorny (not mention painful) bush that was blocking the window. Then I popped the screen off and climbed through. The really funny part is how I had to climb in. I was using a ten foot ladder so I was right next to the window. However, my bathroom window is on the small size. So I had to slide from the top of the ladder into the window. Then I had to use my right hand/arm to brace my weight against the toliet as slid the rest of the way into the bathroom. It wasn't exactly my most graceful moment.

I am so happy that our next door neighbors are on vacation. I'm also glad for the fence in the backyard. The last thing I wanted to happen was for some nosy person to call the cops on me. I didn't like the idea of having to explain to the police how I had to break into my own bathroom, because I accidentally locked myself out.</lj-cut> 

Today I take my test. It's at 2pm, only a few more hours away. I'm nervous, but I will pass the test. If I don't pass it then I'll just take it again in January.

I would like to take this time to welcome <lj user=""koriandr""> back to the world of the internet. YAY for you! She finally has everything working over there. I'm happy for her, but I'm also happy for me because it means she can edit the two stories I had waiting for her. I'm so selfish. I'm also happy, because she's writing me a Kuwabara/Hiei story for my birthday! When she told me about it I squealed really loud in the phone and she 'claims' that I hurt her ear. I finished the outline for her Kuwabara/Yukina birthday story. It will be six chapters. I had to tack on an epilogue, otherwise I would have messed up the chapter format I had going on. I walked her through the outline and told her about the plans I had for the story. She seems to like it, so that's good.

I have some other stuff to write, but I'll do it later. I need to have breakfast and get ready.

"event","I have a couple of things happening within the next couple of days. Before I talk about that I'm going to talk about the past... 

Out of the three final exams I was facing, I only ended up taking one them. I knew that I wouldn't be taking Dr. I's test in advance. However, when I went to take Dr. D's exam on Tuesday at 8am, I found out that I didn't have to take his exam. I had a feeling that I wouldn't have to take it, which is why I didn't study for it. I would've been really upset had I spent all weekend studying for an exam that I didn't have to take. It's moments like that that I'm glad I procrastinate ^_^ Even though I was happy that I didn't have to take Dr. D's exam, I was annoyed that I still had to be up at 6am so I could be on time to class just find out I didn't even have to stay. The only exam I ended up taking was Dr. J's, which was also on Tuesday but at 4pm. So I ended up driving to Prairie View twice. I'm glad my car has good gas mileage. 

Moving onto the future...

Saturday at 2pm I have to take my TExES exam. It's part one of the exam, the Professional and Pedagogy portion. A couple of weeks ago I took a practice exam and I failed by four questions. The only reason I missed some questions was because I second guessed myself. Had I stuck with my original answers I would've passed the damn thing. So Thursday and Friday I'll be taking another practice test and studying. I'm a crammer by nature. If I try to prepare for a test a week or two in advance I'll get frustrated and give up studying all together. However, if I wait until right before the test I do much better. I'm trying to stay positive, which is something I'm not used to doing. It's worth a shot though. If I can't be positive for myself, I certainly can't rely on others to be positive for me. I'll pass the test!

The same Saturday that I take my certification exam I have my five year high school reunion. I was seriously considering going until I found out that it was being held at a barn. That in itself isn't too bad, but I have to bring my own food, drink, and chair. Hell no! When I hear the words 'high school reunion' I envision a room with air conditioning and food/drinks/chairs that are being provided for me! That's the bad thing about being from a small town, they like to do things ass backwards. So I'm not going. I can stay at home where I already have my own food, drink, and a chair. 

John will be gone from Thursday until Sunday. I'm going to miss him, but I'm also looking forward to the time alone. I'll mainly miss him though. Saturday after the test instead of going to reunion I'll probably go and hang out with my folks. It's been awhile since I've spent time with them. I have the feeling that both of my parents will be at work though. Maybe my sister will be free. 

My current writing status...

I've been working on the Kuwabara/Mitarai story on and off. The past few days I've mainly been working on the story that I'm writing for <lj user=""koriandr"">. It'll be five chapters long and so far I've got it almost completely outlined. I need to redo the first chapter, because I changed my mind about what I want it to be about and I need to add a few more scenes to the fourth chapter. Once I finish outlining those two chapters I can get to work on writing it. 

I decided that the story Twisted Triangle that I've been working on for awhile will definitely be Kuwabara/Hiei. Recently I was inspired by a story by <lj user=""taiho_shock""> and that help to cement my decision. I just need to get to work on it now...some how I see myself being lazy >< The only problem with procrastination is that I end up procrastinating even when it comes to doing the things that I like! 

And on that note, I'm out of here."

The temperature dropped! Yesterday and today had temps in the 30s. I love cold weather, it's the best. Sadly, I know it won't last much longer. That's weather in Texas, one day it's hot, the next day it's raining, and then out of nowhere it gets cold (this is how the weather has actually been for the  past four days). Crazy as the weather is, I still love it here.

Tomorrow my sister and I are going shopping. I'm going to get a new coat. I want it to be leather but I'm open to other kinds. I'm going to get a study manual for the TExES exam that I'll be taking next Saturday. Then I'm going to the Texas Store to get some gifts for my pen pal since she loves Texas. I'll probably get something for my sister too, because she hardly ever buys anything for herself and she thinks I have good taste in clothing. I think we'll have a good time, as long as she doesn't get impatient after one hour. She has been known to do that and it's most annoying ><

I haven't been writing lately, but today I'm in the mood to. I hope I'll be productive, but somehow I think I'll find a way to distract myself and forget about writing."

"event","Today I will be cooking and cleaning, hence the clever subject line ^_^

I haven't washed my clothes in a good week, if not more. The towels, sheets, and blanket need to be washed and changed. The carpet needs vacuuming and since John did the dishes (and is currently mowing the lawn), I guess I have no problem doing it. I should probably get the bathroom done while I'm at it. Then I get to spend the rest of my time baking pies. I don't mind that part, because I like to cook. I've never made a homemade pie crust before, but I am confident it will turn out great! 

Maybe if I'm lucky I'll get some writing done tonight. I should be able to unless I get caught up over at IMVU again. I'm really liking that site, 3D chatting is way more interesting than Yahoo messenger. 

That's all I have to write. I just want to jot something down before I get to work."

"event","I'm looking at images over on aarinfantasy.com and after going through all the pages in the Naruto gallery I need a break. It's hard work sifting through all the Naruto/Sasuke and Sasuke/Naruto to find pictures I like. It's worth it though, because I found some really good images. 

<b>Things I Don't Like:</b>
1. Fanfiction that turns Kurama into a girl. If a person needs to change his gender in order to feel comfortable writing about him doing another a guy then that person should not be writing about him having sex. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. 
2. Any fanfiction that portrays Hiei acting like a little kid. He's short, not five years old. There aren't that many stories that do that, but I have read enough of them to upset me. 
3. When people stick their gum underneath tables. The worst though is when people stick their gum behind the railing in elevators. I HATE THAT SO MUCH!! It's very, very nasty! I say this, because I like to hold onto those railings and I've touched ABC gum more times then I want to remember. 
4. People who drive below the speed limit. Most annoying, especially since I seem to get stuck behind them and not be able to pass them due to oncoming traffic. 
5. Elementary, Middle, and High school history textbooks, because they are full lies and half truths. That one just came out of nowhere, oh well, I still don't like it. 

<b>Things I Do Like:</b>
1. Spending the day reading a good book. 
2. Spending the night working on one of my stories. 
3. I'm very fond of reading, writing, and viewing smut. 95% of the time my mind is in the gutter and I couldn't be happier or more well adjusted ^__^
4. Learning something new. 
5. Throwing stuff, nothing in particular, just stuff in general. Yes, I'm aware of how weird that sounds and I don't care. I like to throw stuff.  

<b>Five of My Weaknesses:</b>
1. pistachio almond ice cream
2. Pepsi
3. Helping out family and friends, not that I think that is a bad thing, I just do it a lot. 
4. I like money, but more specifically I like MY OWN money, not other peoples' money. 
5. Buying movies, anime, manga, and anything else that I want. 

<b>Recent Conclusions:</b>
1. John Cena looks like a monkey. 
2. Dr. D will refer to me as Aristotle until I graduate. 
3. I'm going to be sick of pumpkin pie very soon. Not because I'm going to eat a lot, but because I'm going to be baking them. 
4. I need to buy some new winter clothes, which sucks because I don't like shopping for clothes. 
5. I want to get two more tattoos. They will both be custom designed ones, so I'll have to wait awhile before I can get them done. 
6. I can't remember the last time I got drunk, so I should do it this weekend. It'll be most fun to do so.  
*I had to mess up the number scheme, I don't go for uniformity* 

I don't know where all of that came from, but I'll probably end up adding to it later. There are a lot of things that don't/do like. However, I can't write more about my weaknesses then people will be able to defeat me. 

Before I go a few quick notes about my stories. Kuwabara/Mitarai still coming along nicely. Haven't written anymore on the Kuwabara/Kurama story. I have a new idea for a Kuwabara/Hiei one-shot, it's called 'Why Psychics Should Skip Right to the Make Up Sex'. I think it will be pretty funny, which is what I'm aiming for."

"event","I'm not doing much tonight. That doesn't bother me though, because I don't mind staying to home. 

Since this is my journal  I should write about the goings on in my life...

Tomorrow John and I are going to take my sister and nephew out to lunch. We're having Mexican food. My nephew's birthday is on Monday. His mom was going to take everybody (nephew, mom, dad, john and me) out to dinner for his birthday. But since Sawyer was being mouthy and got in trouble  his birthday dinner was canceled. So tomorrow John and I are giving Sawyer his presents. I need to finish wrapping them tonight and make him a card. 

John got a new car. I'm writing about this only because the car is so gorgeous! It's an Infiniti G35 coupe. It is nothing short of incredible. It's so fast. The other day we were driving on back roads and had it up to 120 mph. It was such a rush. I love driving fast. I've been in a car with someone driving 140mph and that was the fastest I've ever gone. I'm sure John's car could easily match it if he wanted it to. 

The Kuwabara/Mitarai story is coming along nicely, considering I haven't worked on it for awhile. Maybe I can finish it up this week or at the very least write another five pages or so. I have already started working on a new Kuwabara/Kurama story. I just need to do a little tweaking to the beginning. By a little tweaking I mean totally redo it. I don't think it will be too hard. I have a better way for it to open that doesn't make the sex scene seem OOC and out of place. <lj user=""koriandr""> and I need to get started on our collaboration story, however, that's easier said than done. Her computer and internet are still not working. 

I bought a 1GB MP3 player, which was really stupid on my part. It didn't have nearly enough space. I'm going to take it back to Wal-Mart and exchange it for a 4GB. That should be enough space for me, because 20GB just seems like a really obscene amount. 

Those are all the goings on I have to report on."

"event","I had a pleasantly miserable weekend. I got to* (*-reads as 'forced to') march in the Homecoming Parade. The A.C.E.I. truck looked like a pink and blue pinata. I didn't know if I was supposed to march in front of it or hit it with a wooden stick. I'll have to post pictures to drive home my point. My nephew spent the weekend so he could be in the parade. Instead of gently tossing handfuls of candy towards people, he was throwing pieces of candy as hard as he could directly at them. God bless him for doing what I had enough etiquette not to do. 

I was sick all weekend too. I only had a cold, but it was a pretty nasty cold. Saturday afternoon* (*-why couldn't I be at my sickest that morning and avoid the parade!) my cold finally became unbearable. I bought some generic Nyquil called Nite Time, which totally knocked me out! It didn't help that I had a fever. 2 tablespoons of Nite Time + a fever = me talking in my sleep and saying/doing a bunch of weird stuff. Honestly, I can't even write about everything that I did because there are no words for it. How do I know I was acting crazy you ask...because John was kind enough to tell me all about it the next day. Every time I think about what I did in my fever/drug induced state I start laughing so hard that I cry. It was and still is pretty damn funny. 

That's pretty much sums up my weekend, so I'm going to leave it at that."

Last Thursday, October 26, I had the distinct displeasure of receiving a parking ticket. I have a parking tag (unlike during the summer) I just forgot to put it hang it up when I got out of the car. That's what I get for going home on my break just to get laid. So today I went to the parking place and started the appeal process. I have to do it formally on November 9. I need to make big signs and post them up all around the house so I don't forget. I really don't want to give them $50. Especially since I just spent $40 buying a t-shirt and a hat for my nephew. Not that I mind, because I would willingly buy him whatever he wanted. 

I'm already sick of A.C.E.I., actually I was sick of it after the first meeting. I'm sick of everybody in the organization. I've said what I had to say about that and now I will be moving on. 

I started working on the Kuwabara/Mitarai story. I have two and a half pages written so far. More than likely I'll work on it after I get home today. I'm hesitant to post the Kuwabara/Kurama fic, because it is a summer story and it's fall now. I'll probably end up doing a new story about them. Yeah, that's what I'll do. There's nothing wrong with the Kuwabara/Yusuke fic, except that I'm not working on it. I have plans for some Kuwabara het stories. I just enjoy the yaoi so much more!

This weekend is Homecoming and I couldn't care less. I wouldn't have anything to do with it except that I'm the vice-president of A.C.E.I. and our organization is marching in the parade. That's all I have to write about that. As a matter of fact that's all I have to write about anything. I'm done here."

"event","I'm trying to work on the first one-shot for my collaboration with <lj user=""koriandr"">. I'm trying to decide between: Kuwabara/Yusuke, Kuwabara/Kurama, or Kuwabara/Mitarai. The first two are stories that I've already started on, but never finished. The third one is a new idea. Kuwabara and Mitarai meet after a few years and Mitarai reveals some feelings and hot sex ensues, it's a typical PWP/WAFF from me. The Kuwabara/Yusuke fic is about how Yusuke is lusting after Kuwabara and the only way he can be close to him is by fighting. The fights are getting more and more violent, which is starting to disturb Kuwabara because he knows how Yusuke feels about him. In order to try and calm Yusuke down, Kuwabara offers to have a one night stand with him. There will be some touching, kissing, and fondling, but nothing more than that. I can't say why, because that will ruin the ending. The Kuwabara/Kurama fic is about a day at the beach. Kuwabara is in a speedo and Kurama and he find a secluded spot, need I say more? I think they are all good ideas and I'm having a hard time picking one to write first. I'll just work on each of them and see how it goes. 

I have a group meeting today at 3pm. I haven't done my part yet, because I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing. My group and I have to reenact a supreme court case. How can Dr. D expect an accurate simulation in under 20 minutes? I think he's smoking crack. I said I would be the defense lawyer, but now I'm wishing that I volunteered to be the bailiff. It's too late now, so I'll just have to deal with it. The good news is that the project is only worth 50 points.

"event","I don't like bureaucracy, it's nothing but red tape and pain the ass. Let me back up and elaborate...

During the summer I went to summer school. During this time I commuted to school and parked illegally in a parking for 3 weeks and 2 days. Since I would only be there for three more days, I said 'forget about it' and I decided to pay the fine, but not waste an additional $50 buying a parking tag to avoid more fines. It was only 3 days after all. Anyways, I pay the fine. Fast forward to the Fall semester and the month of October...


Somebody tell me why I had a hold on my account for two and a half months and I just found out yesterday?! Apparently the (insert sarcasm here) lovely people at the Parking office thought I still owed them money. When they originally charged me (more sarcasm here) the geniuses did it as .50 instead of $50. So even though they've already cashed my check and had the money they charged me again. 

To make matters worse, I think my financial aid has been messed up, because of the Parking office's mistake. Which would explain why I had to make my first two payments out of pocket. So this morning as soon as I got out of class I went over there and got it all straightened out. It was quick and painless, but it still shouldn't have happened in the first place. Oh well, life goes on. 

I'll be back later to write more. I mainly wrote about this to kill some time I have two hours until my next class starts. I think I'll go read now."

Needless to say, I'm not very happy. I want to go home and write, because I can't use words like ""cock"", ""erection"", ""ass"", ""pounding"" and ""boys kissing"" when I'm at school. People are noisy. Just because you know me it doesn't give you the right to come stand over my shoulder, read my computer screen, and ask 'What are you doing?' Sorry people, but it doesn't work that way! 

I'm so bored right now. I would go to the store and pick up some items I need, but if I do that I'll have a hard time coming back here to turn in my assignment. I have homework that I could be doing, except the books I need to complete them are all at home. So here I am sitting in the computer lab and writing something in here. Not that this is a bad thing, I just rather be at home doing it. It doesn't help matters that I had to dress up for a presentation today.

I think he will get a kick out of that, because he is 7 years old and things like that are cool. Saturday I have to go to a fundraiser (I'm the vice-president), so I'll have to bring him along with me. As long as I only have to stay for 2 or 3 hours I think it will be okay, any longer and he might get restless. If he behaves, I'll take him out for a treat.

I have a feeling the last part is easier said than done though. However, we do already have an idea for our first fic.

"event","I now know why it's been taking me so long to write my stories lately. It's really quite simple, I can't believe it took me so long to realize why. Ever since I was a little kid I've bitten my nails. It used to be because I was nervous. As I got older it was because I was bored. Around the time that I started writing fanfiction I did it, because it helped me think and inspired me. I also did it, because I just enjoy biting my nails. Back in January I gave it all up. For nine months I didn't bite  my nails and for nine months my writing fell off. Except for during this summer and I believe that was because I was chewing the hell out of gum on a regular basis. Apparently I'm at my most creative when I'm biting my nails or chewing gum. Unfortunately I can't/don't want to do either one of them. If I bite my nails then I walk around with bare nubs, because I chew them down really, really, really low. If I chew gum for too long then I cause my TMJ to act up in a major way. 

It's quite the predicament. Either I bite my nails for the sake of my writing and not shake hands, point things out, or do anything that involves me showing off non-existent fingernails. Or I can chew gum for 4+ hours a day and give myself a serious pain in the jaw, neck, and head for the sake of my writing. 

Now that I've had my epiphany I'm free to move on to other topics...

Slowly, but surely I'm finishing up the final chapter of Two Months in the Forest. I'm working on elaborating some scenes, adding more dialogue, and completing the lemon. Maybe by tonight I can finish most of it up. 

John put together three bookshelves a few days ago. I've already filled them up with my books and knickknacks. It's nice to finally have all my stuff put away. I even cleaned out my closet and rearranged everything in there. The only things I need to do now are give away the stuff I set aside for charity and to exchange my unwanted books at the bookstore. Maybe next weekend I'll get around to it. 

That's all for now. I want to save the rest of my writing for my fanfiction."

Usually when faced with a situation like this I would wait until around 3 or 4pm then start working my ass off. Surprisingly, I didn't do that today. I cut the TV off at 11am and started reading the article. I had to read it aloud (all 8 pages of it), because if I read it to myself then my mind starts to wander and I find that after reading two pages I have no clue about what I just read. After I read the article I immediately started to write it.  Here I am 2 hours later with the rough draft done. I'm going to wait until 2pm to proofread it, because if I wait I'll have a clearer head and be able to focus more. I'm quite proud of myself for not procrastinating. However, if I really wasn't procrastinating I would have written the review yesterday, but that really doesn't matter does it ^_^

I'm busy downloading manga right now. I'm working on Full Metal Alchemist. I should give stoptazmo.com a donation. I would do it too, but I just paid the first installment of my tuition yesterday. I'm still hurting about that. All that money gone for a quality education. As soon as my loan comes in though I'll get most of it back if not all of it. 

I feel like writing today. As soon as I finish the article I'll get to work. I just don't know which story it will be though. Two Months in the Forest, The Wager or Heist, all I know is that it definitely won't be Old Promises and New Beginnings. I really don't feel motivated at all to work on it. Then I can donate.

I did talk a little fast though, but towards the middle I slowed to a regular speed. My mouth was dry as hell, but I worked through it. I did a pretty good job. I made eye contact, I was informative, and all that other good stuff that goes along with public speaking.

I need to really focus and finish the last chapter of Two Months in the Forest. It shouldn't be that hard, but I'm making it harder by avoiding it. I'm also not motivated to work on it right now either. So, yeah I suck.

It doesn't help that I have another story that I'm working on! I don't know if I already wrote about it here, so I'll do it again. The title of the story would be 'The Wager'. Bear with me this is where it can get a little confusing. Kurama and Botan bet Yusuke and Shizuru that they can get Hiei to lose his virginity before Yusuke and Shizuru can get Kuwabara to lose his. So Kurama and Botan are trying to seduce Hiei themselves, Kurama more so than Botan, but Hiei isn't responding. Yusuke and Shizuru try to push Kuwabara and Yukina closer together. As it turns out Hiei has a thing for Yusuke and in turn Yusuke has a thing for Hiei. So Yusuke can either give into Hiei and lose the bet or try to fight off Hiei's advances. There's more to it, but that's the best I can do right now without giving too much away. That's a terrible summary, but it is a good idea. I'm almost done with the first chapter. The story will mainly be comedy and sexy goodness.

"event","I came back from AnimeFest early. I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but I said to hell with it and came back tonight. It was fun and I enjoyed it, but it was starting to get boring. Yesterday I mainly walked around and shopped. Today I went to the viewing theaters in the morning then shopped some more. I took some pictures of this lady cosplaying of Kakashi. She looked awesome! She had the book and everything. When I took her picture she pretended to read it. Then I took a picture of this girl cosplaying as the Count from Gankutsuou. She looked good, but she seemed kinda nervous about posing for my picture. No biggie, it didn't hurt my feelings. Those were the only pictures I took, because the other people came as characters that I didn't like or wasn't interested in. 

I got lots of good stuff! I spent more then I expected, but that's mainly because John gave me some extra money. He's so sweet! I bought the cutest plushies! Naruto in a bunny costume, Kakashi in a dog costume, and Itachi in a rat(?) costume, I'm still uncertain. The dealer offered me a discount on the three them which I was more than happy to take him up on. There was a Sasuke one, but of course I didn't buy it because he's an asshole. I refuse to support assholes even if they're part of a set. I also bought manga, a key chain, 2 action figures, artwork, a cool origami dragon (absolutely amazing and worth the money) and 2 wall scrolls. The only thing I didn't buy was anime, because why buy it when I can get it for free. 

I suppose I should talk about the main reason why I left. There were so many teenagers around. I just can't stand teenagers. Even when I was one I didn't like them. I don't know why it is, but every time I'm around a bunch of teens I get pissed off and annoyed. I went downstairs to see if I won this raffle I entered, but the area was so over run with the kids that I couldn't handle it. As soon as I saw the scene I felt the corners of my mouth being pulled down. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't bring myself to pull them back up. I hauled ass back up to the hotel room and asked John if we could leave. The hotel didn't charge us for the night (the lady who checked us in also checked us out that's why) and 4 and 1/2 hours later we were home.  

I'm going to go read the piece of bad fanfiction that I'm addicted to (I can't help it, I want to know what happens!!) then hit the hay. I have a presentation to prepare tomorrow. Can anyone say procrastination?"

If I'm really excited or looking forward to something then someone in my my family is really upset about something else. Coincidence? Probably, but the slightly superstitious side of me thinks not. Case in point, all week my mom and sister have been fighting like crazy. They've never gotten along, but lately it's been worse than usual. My sister always comes to me to vent. I don't mind her doing that, because I know she doesn't have anyone else to vent to. But I refuse to take sides, her and my mom both know that. I get the feeling that my mom respects that more than my sister does. Their fighting came to a head last night. My sister called me on the phone and then proceeded to have an argument with my mom while I listened. That was a  really sorry thing to do, I should have hung up the phone but I didn't. Once they were done my sister was like 'Did you hear that?' How can I not hear it when you left me on the phone on purpose?! She starts ranting and raving then she stopped and said, ""I'm sorry, I shouldn't be doing this to you. You're going out this weekend to have a good time and I'm bothering you."" Or something to that effect. Anyways, after hearing that I felt bad and told her that if she needed to talk I'm here and that I don't mind. Which is the truth. There's a whole lot more to the story, but I don't need to go into. This is why I think that my happiness comes at the cost of someone else's happiness. That's a pretty messed line of reasoning, but we're talking about 18 years worth of thinking this way.

Anyways...

Why am I excited? Because I'm going to AnimeFest today! YAY YAY YAY YAY!!!!!!!! This is my first anime convention. I'm most excited! It's being held in Dallas, which is a good 4 hour drive from where I live, but it's so worth it! I'll be staying at the Hyatt Regency Hotel which is where the convention is being held. I've been hording my cash for a month just for this weekend. I made a t-shirt that says 'Rabid Fangirl', I know it's a cliche but I think it fits. But now that I think of it I wish I had made a shirt that read 'Proud Fangirl'. I'll just have to do that for next year then. I can't wait to leave, but we're not leaving until around noon. That's two whole hours away. I'm getting antsy now. 

That's pretty much all I have to say. I'm happy, but in the back of my mind I'm still thinking about my sister and mom and their collective problems. I know I shouldn't, but family has that effect on me."

I need to get to work on the outline for the next installment of Old Promises and New Beginnings. I was talking to JovianWolfGirl about the story, after all I am writing it for her. I bounced some of my ideas off of her and that helped me out. I told her that she really challenged me with this story. I like a good challenge. It gets boring if you just write the same thing over and over again. However, once I finally finish the story I will never ever write another crossover fic. Old Promises and New Beginnings is the first and last one. 

I had an idea for a new fic. Hiei and Kuwabara are both virgins. Kurama and Botan bet Shizuru and Yusuke that they can get Hiei to lose his virginity before they can get Kuwabara to lose his. Yusuke and Shizuru accept the bet and hilarious sex hijinks ensue. Either Hiei and Kuwabara lose their virginity together or with other people. I haven't decided yet. But since I love yaoi and I love Kuwabara/Hiei I'm leaning towards them getting it on. I started working on the first chapter. If it turns out good, I'll seriously work on the story. Otherwise forget about it. 

Tomorrow will be anime day. I'm going to finish watching Spiral. I'm going to watch the final two volumes of Tenjho Tenge. I've have heard bad things about the final episode, so I'm a little worried about watching it. If that's the case I'll just have to finish the manga, it's usually better anyways. I'm going to watch the next volume of Naruto. While I'm at it I should be able to finally finish Texhnolyze too. I still have the stuff koriandr sent me to finish watching. If John goes over to his friend's house like he said then I can watch all I want no problem. If he's here I kinda feel bad doing that, but only a teeny-tiny bit bad.

Yeah I got over my writer's block. I just finished the new chapter of Two Months in the Forest and sent it off to be edited. Maybe I can post it tomorrow. If not, oh well, waiting another day won't hurt anybody. Just one more chapter to go and I'll be all done. It will be easier to write since it won't be too long. It won't be too short either since it will have yet another lemon. 

I got pissed off today, because I got up early and went to Prairie View for no damn reason. All together I wasted 3 hours(drive time + actual time spent there) trying to fix something that couldn't be taken care of until Monday. At the time I was really upset, but now I'm only mildly annoyed.

I decided not to go to my cousin's wedding. I have several good reasons for not going.
1. It feels like she only invited me as an after thought.
2. It feels like I'm the only one putting effort into maintaining our friendship.
3. She didn't even invite my parents or my sister and nephew to her wedding. That made me mad. My family has been nice and supportive of her always. Why the hell aren't they good enough to attend her funky wedding? 
4. I just don't like going to weddings. 

I don't even think I'll give her the present I bought. Why give somebody a present that they probably won't even appreciate. I'm not going to worry about it anymore. I'm at peace with my  decision."

"event","I just made another icon and this time it's animated. I like it very much. It took me awhile to do, at least until I started using another program then it was way easier. I need to work on the timing since it's a little off in certain places. Maybe tomorrow, because today I've had enough of making icons. 

Since I spent so much time making it I didn't do much writing. After a short break I will definitely get back to the porn!"

"event","I'm burning some dvds right now. Since it takes a little bit of time in between discs I could be  working on Two Months in the Forest, but instead I'm typing a bunch of nothing over here. I'll eventually work on the story, but I'm always more willing to work on something after I've put off doing it for awhile. I mainly need to go in and elaborate the sex scenes, I always put off doing that part to the end. There's also a part of the threesome that still needs to be planned out then written. I have an idea about what I want to do. But I can safely say that the final position is DAMN HOT! Just thinking about it turns me to jello. *swoons* 

The Kurama/Hiei fic is on hold. I don't know if I want to finish writing it or give it the boot. If I get some inspiration then I'll work on it some more. Otherwise it'll just be there, existing, but not existing...I need to stop. I like to exaggerate.

Last night I couldn't sleep (I was awake until 6am) so I started working on a Kuwabara/Kurama one-shot. Just like with Two Months in the Forest, the only thing I need to do is elaborate certain scenes and I'll be done. It's amazing how much I can accomplish in four hours. The story takes place at the beach. I know it's cliche and I just used it in the last chapter of Old Promises and New Beginnings, but I couldn't get the image of Kazuma in a Speedo out of my mind. I'm still drooling from that one. Of course, he's not willingly wearing the Speedo, which makes the story funny. I'm better at writing comedy than angst. I'm sure I could write some angst if I wanted to, but it's just not what I prefer. I don't know why I just wrote that, it I had nothing to with the original statement. Oh well."

"event","Okay here is my first Sasuke-kun icon:

Here is the new and hopefully improved version:
<img src=""http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m87/dreamy_dragon/SasukeEdit6.jpg"" />

I played with the font type, font color, and put some emphasis on the 'asshole' part. I had also made one where the '#1' was in black, but it looked weird since it was surrounded by dark blue. I think it's pretty clear how I feel. I don't think I'm taking this to far, because I think it's pretty damn funny. I see all these icons talking about how awesome he is and idolizing him, so I had to make one about him too. It's a small step, but I had to do something to defy all the Sasuke fangirls out there."

"event","I just made my second icon. It's Yuuri from Kyo Kara Maou. It was supposed to read 'Where's My Wolfram?!' but I couldn't get it to fit. I still like it, so it's okay.

So here's my first attempt:

And this is the second attempt: 
<img src=""http://i102.photobucket.com/albums/m87/dreamy_dragon/YuriEdit4.jpg"" />

I think it looks good, then again I'm biased and think everything I do is awesome. The only thing is I need to start using a color other than red, but it was the only color that showed up without being too gaudy looking. Next on the list is Rock Lee. I found the perfect image to use.

I'm going to try and get some writing done tonight. I won't promise myself that I will. I'll just have to wait and see how I feel."

"event","I just finished making my very first icon. It's not the best, the sizing is off. I'm sure I'll get better though. The icon is a testament to how much of a Sasuke fan I am. I found this website that has a lot of images on it that are good making icons. I plan on making one for Naruto, Kakashi, and Rock Lee. Eventually I'll move on to other anime, specifically Yu Yu Hakusho, Tenjou Tenge, Kyo Kara Maou, Gankutsuou, and some other shows that I like. 

I'm going to watch Invader Zim now. If I feel like it I'll do some more writing after it goes off or else I'll go to sleep."

"event","My TMJ is starting to clear up. It's still there, but at least the pain in my neck has lessened and the constant headaches are gone. Although my jaw is still clicking a lot. I'm hoping that in a week it will be gone completely. 

I'm working on the next chapter of Two Months in the Forest. If I can stay focused then I might be able to complete it in less than a week. Right now I'm working on the threesome. Judging by the outline of the scene alone it looks really hot! Once I'm done with this chapter I'll have one more to go. I'm looking forward to finishing the story.

I need to work on Old Promises and New Beginnings. I know what I want to have happen in the next chapter, I just need to write it...easier said then done. 

Over the weekend I watched a lot of Naruto. I'm not done watching it yet, but I have already reached the conclusion that Sasuke is a little asshole. I honestly don't understand why all those fangirls are so crazy about him! I know he's not real and it's just a cartoon, but it still bothers me. I rarely read fanfiction that has him paired up, because he doesn't like anybody and I just don't see it happnening. If he did ever hook up with a girl it would be so she could have his babies. Now that I have complained about him I feel at peace with myself. I also don't like Sakura. She's boring and useless. All she does is say 'Sasuke-kun!' and fawn all over him. It's really annoying. 

I should go work on the all male threesome. It will be a lot more interesting than bitching about Sasuke and Sakura."

"event","I posted chapter 10 of Two Months in the Forest today. I've already gotten 3 reviews, so I'm feeling pretty good. I admit I'm a review whore, but at the same time I'm not as bad as I could be. If I was really a review whore I would only write about popular pairings. I would also write 'you' fics. The day I do that I will retire from writing fanfiction for good! That's a very serious promise. I don't need to worry about it though, because I will never write one ^_^ No offense to people that write/read 'you' fics, they're just not my cup of warm watered-down tea. 

I'm also happy, because I'm almost finished with Two Months in the Forest! YAY, GO ME! Two more chapters to go! However, I originally intended for the very last chapter to be only a few pages long. It was going to allude to some sex with Kuwabara and Kurama, but now I'm thinking about actually including it. The more I think about it the more I want to write it. I can't get the image of Kuwabara screwing Kurama against a tree out of my mind. It's so SEXY, SEXY, SEXY! *composing self* So, yeah, I'm probably going to have to include a nice detailed lemon of those two going at it. 

Speaking of popular pairings (I know only 2 paragraphs to late), the Kurama/Hiei fic is going well. But the way the story is it's going to take me a while to arrange it and make sure it flows together. The fact that it's told from Kurama's POV doesn't help, damn complicated fox that he is. 

I'm going to finish watching wrestling, it amuses me so ^_^"

"event","I'm working on three stories at the same time right now. It feels goods to be able to do that again. Here are the stories:

1. (Yu Yu Hakusho) Two Months in the Forest- Chapter 10 
I have the story written out. What I'm doing right now is elaborating scenes (mainly the porn). I need to work on the scene where Kuwabara and Hiei are sparring. It's pretty long and in need of clear details. Also this scene where Kuwabara and Kurama are discussing Hiei still needs work. For some reason it just reads completely wrong. 

2. (Yu Yu Hakusho) Tentative Title: Would You
This is the story about Hiei and Kurama that I was talking about. The premise is a little cliched, but I think I can make it work. 

3. (Cowboy Bebop) Tentative Title: Desert Heat
It's been a while since I've written some Spike/Faye smut! PWP is fun, especially when it involves those two characters. After their ships break down they are stuck at a some rat hole of a hotel waiting for Jet to come pick them. As usual pointless smut ensues.

Those stories are what I'm working on so far. I'm thinking about writing Kyo Kara Maou and Heat Guy J fanfiction. But it will have to wait for a while. I don't want to take on too many projects since school will be starting soon. 

I'm hoping to have Two Months in the Forest finished by Sunday. At least that's my goal. I've been working hard lately and not letting myself get distract so I'm sure I can have it done. I'll just have to wait and see how it goes though."

"event","I spent over a hour and a half looking over chapter 6 of Old Promises and New Beginnings only not to be able to post it! When I added the chapter over at aff.net everything went smoothly or so it appeared. I went to the story link and tried to read it, but the text wasn't showing. It had the title of the story, but no words. How can you read something that isn't there?! I redid the post several times, but it still wasn't working. I even tried to add chapter 6 as a new story, but the text still wouldn't show. So in conclusion I'm feeling more than a little frustrated.

"event","My self-imposed ban on writing Hiei/Kurama fics is officially over. I have only written one fic about them. After that one I swore up, down, sideways and diagonally that I would never write another one. Apparently I'm better at lying to other people than I am at lying to myself. 

When I first started watching YYH, 4 years ago, I was like 'Hiei and Kurama are together!' There was no doubt in my mind they would make a good couple. So that started my search to find information or at the very least other people who thought the same thing. That is how I first got into fanfiction. It was because of Hiei and Kurama that I started reading it and later on began writing it. I read every story I could about them. I would search constantly, which eventually led me to AFF.net. 

Even though they started off as my favorite pairing, for some reason I started to hate it. I don't know why, maybe because I read a lot of BS stories that just turned me off completely. Or maybe it was because I didn't want to limit myself to only them being a couple. I really don't know why, maybe I didn't even have a reason. But I digress...I stopped reading about them and lost all interest. I moved onto Kurama/Yusuke, Hiei/Kuwabara, and currently Kurama/Kuwabara. 

Like I said earlier, I have only written one Kurama/Hiei story. That was probably 2 years ago. It was well received and I got some nice reviews about it. At the time I wrote the story I had already begun to dislike the pairing, but I wrote it because the damn idea just wouldn't leave me alone! I did it just to get it out of my system. At that point, I told myself that I would never write another story about them again. 

But recently, within the past month, I started changing my mind. Damn, I am one wishy-washy bitch...I don't think that pairing is so horrible anymore. In fact, I'm even warming up to it again. Hell, I even have another story idea, which I've already started working on. Just like last time the idea wouldn't leave me alone. It all started with this line: ""If I asked you to  stay, would you?""

I'm not saying their my favorite pairing or anything like that, I'm just saying that I'm open to the possibility again. If I do write anymore about them it will only be a one-shot. I have to save all my best work for Kuwabara!"

"event","All day it has looked like it was going to rain, but so far it hasn't. I wish it would. I like it when it rains. Sometimes a cloudy day is prettier to me than a sunny one. Oh, well all that stuff is boring, so I'm going to stop writing about it. 

I stayed up late last night and finished Gankutsuou. It was great, but the final episode left me wanting. It was good, but I was hoping there would be a little more to it. I like the pairing of Count/Albert, but I can't write fanfiction for it. I just don't see how it would be possible! Even if I like a pairing, if I don't see how it would work in the anime series then I won't write about it. I'll read it, but I won't write, I refuse to. So therefore, I will not be writing fanfiction for Gankutsuou, even though I love Count/Albert and Franz/Albert. 

I'm done watching Gokusen. I was watching it on some cable channel. It was funny and I liked it. I'm a fan of Yankumi/Shin. They're so cute together! I also started watching Mirage of Blaze, it comes on the same channel as Gokusen. That show is confusing as hell, but the animations is gorgeous, especially the characters. I like it so far. The only down side is that it's only 13 episode long and I'm usually not satisfied with the endings of series that are that short. Gokusen was 13 episodes long too, but I was pretty satisfied with the ending...I still wanted more though. 

I guess I'll finish watching Texhnolye next. But before that I need to edit Old Promises and New Beginnings. I'm going to go do that now."

laura actually had fun being amongst people.
we danced at the party in south park, which laura never does.

dj's was awesomely fun. it was good to see all those people on the start of a brand new year.

had a funny discussion about life and philosophy with craig and zaki when we got home.

i think i mostly just made them frustrated than actually discussing anything remotely profound.

BUT BEST NEW YEARS EVER!

matt, you didnt call me you basatard. lets hang out sometime this weekend."

wilco is a REALLY good band. i went to the music trader and traded in the morrissey cd and got the yankee hotel foxtrot cd. i was bummed so much about the morrissey cd not working and even more bummed when after i got the wilco cd, they actually put on the morrissey one and i got to hear all the rad songs that influenced him to get into music. 

so i'm gonna go buy under the influence again when i get my next paycheck.

but i've been listening to the wilco and the flaming lips all cay and i think i need a change of pace, so i'm gonna throw on some ultravox or flock of seagulls.

laura is going to europe for a month sometime in july.i'm going to miss her.

i bought morrissey's""under the influence"". its a cd that has all of morrisseys favorite artists from the likes of t.rex and the new york dolls.it seems totally fucking rad but i have to take it back cuz it doesnt work on my cd player for some weird reason.

i would give ti to laura but then i'd be risking it not working on her cd player either.

i also bought yoshimi battles the pink robots by the flaming lips.i've been meaning to get this one since it came out, but never got around to it.craig put a song from the album on a mixtape he sent me and it reinvigurated me to go buy it.

i dont go to parties or try to go out.me and the wife just stay in or go to dinner and a movie.

well, laura isnt my wife but i cant picture myself with anyone else.

we dont do drugs any longer, and we've gained weight in result of that.

well, heres a lil tangent that i've been meaning to write 

i spend alot of my time listening to music. its definietly a important part of my life.

craig said that music is the most important thing in his life.he wakes up listening to music, he showers listening to music, he drives listening to music and works listening to music

while i was on vacation, i've met people that claimed to like punk and indie rock,but couldnt even tell me about bands other than pennywise and good charlotte. and they had the nerve to tell me that i dont know anything about music!

i dont know everything about every band in the world, but i do have a vast knowledge in music that interests me and shitty music doesnt interest me.

i always forget that the majority of the music that me and everyone i know generally listens to has no solid place in mainstream america. and when i interact with those type of people i'm always amazed at their total lack of knowledge in the area where so many of my friends and collagues consider general music knowledge.

but it seems people dont bother to even think of music as an important medium of expression.

how many people do you know who have never heard the clash, or elvis costello,talking heads, or even the ramones?i've met quite a few on the 
and these are bands that have made it into or will make into the rocknroll hall of fame.

i cant even mention bands like television or richard hell and the voidoids,or patti smith group to most people and have them know what i'm talking about

when i meet someone who has says they never heard the clash but knows the words to rock the casbah, i'm amazed that people like that actaully exist.

my brother says i listen to too much old music and am losing touch with the new music thats coming out now.

"event","super bowl sunday!!! are there any super bowl parties that anyone knows of??

i saw ted leo at teh casbah thursday night.its the first 21 and up show i've been to since i turned 21.iwent alone,but i wasnt about to miss ted leo!ted leo fuckin rules.i saw sarah payne there and jeff graves and vincent.so i didnt hang out totally by myself, but the 21 and up scene is weird and everyone seems to know everyone else already.

the opening band sucked.it was some band called lucky jeremy,and i think that they were lucky anyone stood around for them at all.it was just boring rock songs that prolly took a few minutes to write and then record.i kept thinking...""me and craig write better songs than this!""
well,mostly craig could.but yeah lucky jeremy sucked

the fiery furnaces were rad,they reminded of mates of state...but with a bit more rocking? the lead singer looked like patty smith but not strung out on drugs.but i think they played too long though.

before ted leo played, he was standing right next to me, and i wanted to say something cool like ""what up sucka brah?"" or ""hey,whats up"",night at the roxbury style, but i just gave him this weird ass smile and he kinda smiled back...it was awkard.haha.

but ted leo ruled!i think the show was better in san francisco cuz he had like a full band there with the organ player and a second guitar.but it was just him,the bass player and a drummer. the songs didnt sound as full as they did in s.f or on record, but they still sounded killer.
they played all the best songs from both albums which was fuckin tuff.i missed craig though cuz he loves the leo, and listening to ted leo reminds me of the S.F trip.sarah said so too.

i got wasted at the bar. i had drank a few beers before i went.when i got there i wasnt sure about the tipping etiquette so i was nervous to buy anything...sarahs ex boyfriend kept saying that you should slip him a one every drink you buy.but i thought that seemed a bit excessive...but then jeff told me you should tip when you buy beer on tap, but if its domestic or a bottle,you shouldnt tip.

a can of pbr was 2 bux!and he made the point that 2 bux plus a tip wuold be way too much for justa  pabst...shit two bux more is a whole 12 pack.

craig,i'm sure your prolly the only person to read this far without skimming so i got your mixtape but havent had time to listen to it all the way through. you put alot of wilco on it i take it.not to be outdone,i made you a tape as well!and its all from my ever expanding collection of 80's new wave!ha, i'll send it monday prolly.

ok,thats it"

its a battle ground out here.like it seemed like when i moved to san diego, there was alot of christians and churchs every corner and the city was full of love and beauty and a deep belief in god.

but then i started to notice that with all that christianity, there was the devil trying to counter act it with drugs.cuz i always hear that san diego is like the meph capitol of the world and everyone i know seems to be on drugs. and its getting to me.

like it seems to every church, theres a crackhouse.

i guess thats just kinda some sort of religious spiritual battle thing that victor used to talk to me about before he lost his faith"

and one record i am ashamed of owning...i bought a christian death record...i feel dirty saying it...but i bought it...and i listened to it...and i convinced my self that it was ok,cuz rikk agnew played guitar on the album...and rikk agnew was in adolescence...and adolescence is one of my favorite bands. i always wanted to hear if he changed his guitar style for christian death...and he didnt really, he just played slower.

its kinda how i convinced myself that big audio dynamite was good cuz mick jones started it after the clash broke up...the do have alot of good songs, but you have to filter out the dub dancedisco crap first.

i've been listening to spanish bombs by the clash nonstop...

"event","went to see the adolescent last night.they were so rad and have been one of my favorite punk bands since i was like 12 or so.it made me remember why kids love punk rock so much in the first place and to see another one of those bands dear to my heart was really enduring...

i've always love the early LA punk sound more than any other.like they were all so different but all the energy was the same,like you could just hear through the songs that they were all on the same wave length and state of mind.bands like social d,X, the weirdo's, the zeros(even though they were from chula vista!they are considered LA based)black flag,circle jerks,adolescents,the germs and even agent orange i dig.

i kept thinking how amazing it would have been to be able to see them and all the other early LA bands in their heyday,and it was kinda of sad to me to see these 30 something guys playing to an audience of 14 year olds and some who only knew the words to ""AOMEBA"" cuz its on tony hawk pro skater 3 game.
but then i remember how cool i thought they were when i first heard them. 

they have such rad harmonizing and its rare to see that in any punk band nowadays, and to see that they can still pull it off is rad...rikk agnew wasnt there, but i think his brother was playing in his place, cuz they made mention to that on stage.

then me and diana went to some party in hillcrest. i wanted to leave as soon as i got there,after saying hi to eveyone.
i dont ever feel comfortable at parties anymore...not to mention i was driving so i didnt drink more than a shot of applesour rum or other...

but yeah, just walked around annoyed, and eventually left once i knew diana could get a ride home.

i felt bad leving her, but i was tired and bored and much needed sleep"

i like jim croce, neil diamond and cat stevens...WHAT OF IT!at least its not journey....

well, wait...i recently bought a journey record too..hah...i should say at least its not don henley.or the eagles...jesus shit man...

well, i bought a talking heads record,an xtc record,a vapors record,a human league record, and the aforementioned croce record...

adolescents this saturday! whos going!i definietly am,and i think i may be DRIVING to it since laura has work and wont be able to go...which sucks!!! so i might be able to give some people a ride...for the first time in history i'm willing to drive to a show...i'm gonna see if diana already got a ride with jon or not and if not, i'll take her.

"event","i bought the lord of the rings that has all the books combined and been reading it nonstop.

and its a well known fact that prolly only a quarter of the stuff in the book actually made it to the movies,but you know what,who cares!i was actually thinking about all the stuff that they left out and i was glad they did some stuff cuz it would have just made the movies soooooo long.seriously,if you nit pick at everything that was in the book that wasnt in the movie, your cheating yourself of the whole entertaining aspect of the movies.it tells the story straightforwardly and it the story is so grand and epic in itself that it would be damn near impossible to include the whole history of the book and being able to include the main story,not to mention all the side stories and minor characters and the dialogue.its insane that they made the movies as close to the books as they did cuz there so much going on that it would need at least three more movies just to include what they left out!

but thats that.

i'm thinking me and laura are gonna g out for sushi tomorrow cuz i never have eaten it before and have been fying to try it.

and i think we are going to invite diana cuz she's japanese.

i had breakfast with my mom and laura was supposed to come but she chickened out.

my mom bought me corona boxers.breakfast was nice.
and my mom was asking me something like if she needs to move back to san diego, would i move in with her and help her with the rent.

i said if she needs my help i'll be there for her.but i dont know how i would feel if i had to live under my moms control again.i think i've gotten so used to freedom that i might find her to be too overbearing.

but i doubt it will ever come to that.i am going to continue on my current plan and plan to move out with laura."

"event","i bought a whole pizza for myself from papa johns at around 7 and only ate three slices...i ate two slices like right away,while the pizza was still hot and got way full...but the third slice i ate like 20 minutes ago.i have most a whole pizza sitting in my room.i'm going to take it for lunch tomorrow.

i dont know why but now i feel full and fat and feel like throwing the rest of the pizza away.but i spent 10 bux on the stupid pizza cuz i had it in my mind all day that i was gonna eat pizza no matter what.dont get me wrong, it was delicious,but i could have gotten little ceasars pizza for like 5 bux, but i think i spent that extra 5 for delivery if you rationalize it...i didnt feel like driving anywhere to actually pick up the pizza.

haha, why i got papa johns i havent a clue.normally i dont like papa johns pizza...then when matts parents came home they had bought one of those giant pizza's and i could have just saved the ten bux!argh...but those are generally really low on quality.

my favorite pizza has to be blondies pizza and i cant wait til i eventually move to either berkely or san francisco so whenever i have a hankering for pizza, i can always just go to blondies...

if you've never had blondies pizza,its definietly the greatest pizza to ever exist.one slice is like eating five pieces of papa johns when it comes to size...that might be an exageration,but i normally exagerate when it comes to blondies...i once described to mandy the greatness of blondies pizza in this way- ""if god was a pizza, he'd be blondies pizza""
with such a bold statement one would expect alot, but mandy still holds treu to her lame,cardboard tasting flimsy Escape from New York pizza, that doesnt deserve even a mention to blondies.

but here in san diego, i normally like getting a slice of pizza from costco cuz its cheesy,huge, good n tasty and only 2 bux for a slice.most pizza by the slice places give such flimsy slices for a ridiculous price.

whats your favorite pizza...let me know so maybe one day i can check it out."

new year,blah blah blah.just so much.and i dont think i wanna type it all.

yesterday i went to the zoo with laura and diana for laura's birthday.it was such a good time and i was sad to see it end. this was the first time i have been to the san diego zoo and i was really impressed and awe'd by it. and just being there with laura made me feel so happy.saw all the cool animals but didnt get to see the panda, which laura really wanted to see and i was bummed we didnt make time for them.

its weird loving some one so much.i dont think i would have a reason to stay in san diego if it werent for laura.i dont really feel the need to always go out and party anymore, and alot of the things that seemed so much fun before just seem dull. and i want things to start getting better for myself so that i can provide a nice life for us and be happy.

i tell myself that we'll be together forever, but theres always that little bit in your mind that says, ""well,maybe it wont last"".i cant ever see myself with any other girl except her in this point of my life

all in all, its like i'm going to devote as much of myself into her and hope things just turn out ok.

i've been saving money and have gotten all the things that i need to do in order.
i;ve been putting so much stuff off, that its seriously piled up beyond control. i am gonna get it all figured out and start saving so that i can eventually move out with laura.
i definietly am immature for 21.
although i do have alot going for me, it seems like my mind is still stuck in like senior year, high school.

i wanna be able to stand on my own two feet and take care of myself, and i think i depend on matts parents for letting me live here.i pay rent and all, but its nothing like if i was payign rent at an apartment or studio.i barely pay for the extra costs of me living here.

i asked laura if she could opena  seperate bank account in her name for me, until i get my bank shit figured out. 

and i seriously dont know where my money goes.

i  know i cant blow a whole paycheck on food, music and dvds.theres other essentials,sure,but not like a whole paychecks worth...

so saving is a must.

and i finally accepted the fact that i am a construction worker.thats my trade.thats my profession.thats my bread and butter.theres no ways around it...i cant picture myself really doing anything else.no way i'm gonna go back to a minimum wage job.

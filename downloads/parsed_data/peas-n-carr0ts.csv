"event","I pretend that I'm glad you went away
These four walls closing more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
Painted real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly but your nowhere around

The nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you 
And nobody knows it but me

I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm trembling inside 
And nobody knows it but me (yeah)

I lie awake, it's a quarter past three
I'm screaming at night if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah, my heart is calling you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get?
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be loving you still

The nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you 
And nobody knows it but me

Tomorrow morning
I'm hittin the dusty road
Gonna find you where ever
Ever you might go
And I'm gonna load my heart
And hope you come back to me

Say when the nights are lonely
The nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you 
And nobody knows it but me

The nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you 
And nobody knows it but me

i bought 2 tickets to see Spider Man 2.. and of course i picked Ash cause we can talk FOR HOURS about Marvel comics... the look on his face was price.. THENNN he got mad cause i paid for movie tickets

so i gave it about a... 4.. on a 5 scale.. real good.. cept.. too much of a love story.. BUT.. they followed the comic pretty well.. i dont agree with the Peter Parker/Toby McGuire character.. hes too nerdy... Peter Parker in the comic wasnt so nerdy.. or not AS nerdy.. + the webs that he ""shoots"" out of his wrists arent supposed to come out of that side.. its the OTHER side.. + the HAND makes the webs.. and throws em.. rather than letting em come out of his wrists.. i dont know lol im a nerd :D and i love comics.. ::bows head::

Ash is wonderful.. VERY sweet.. we went to his house after the movie.. and it was SOOO cute.. cause i was looking at his comic book.. and he just started drawing.. and it was amazing.. haha maybe its just my love for art :) as well as his :D but he wants to take me somewhere ""special"" tomorrow .. kinda excited haha MAYBE!!!! its to the Art Museum!! :D :D the crazy thing is.. he LOVES Monet.. and SO DO I!! haha.. so beautiful from far away.. but so complex looking up close :)

i think this is my turning point.. and i havent talked to justin.. so thats kinda good.. cause i figured the only way to get over someone is NOT to talk to em right? haha

Chris and ROni broke up.. so hes been callin me more :(.. i try not to answer.. cause i know y hes calling... he thinks we should get together.. and i dont want to.. lol so i try to avoid the calls.. even tho i told him that i didnt think it was the best for right now.. since i am still in love with justin :(.. which brings to mind... he told me how bad i broke his heart.. ((not sure how)) but ive never broke it like hes broken mine... he thinks its not fair to give me another chance cause I want to work things out now.. and i can see where he came from.. but i still dont see where he thinks i hurt him more than hes hurt me.. ack.. and he asks me y i still wanna be with him if i think hes hurt me so much n junk.. to be honest.. i dont know the answer to that one either.. but i know that i love him.. and that he was my first love :( but i guess we grow wise of the  mistakes we make :( its just another lesson in life :\ another problem to get over right? no biggie.. i can do it! :D who knows.. maybe hell come to his senses.. and come back.. and realize how much i DO love him.. if he loves me the way he still says he does.. hell come back.. all things happen for reason.. and if he doesnt.. then ill know it wasnt meant to be.. what was that one quote.. if you let something go.. and it comes back.. its your to keep??? haha something like that...

on the brighter side?? im leaving tomorrow.. i guess yay cause it gives me time to think about everything back at home.. gives me a chance to figure out what decision goes with what problem.. kinda time to see it from outside the issue.. i have so many things on my mind...

but i thank alyss for making my last few days the most rememberable ones :) i <3 you and ill be sure to write :) maybe when i come back.. i can go down there :) tell the familia i said hey and that i miss them :) EXCUSE ME?? hahahah what a riot.. love ya alyss..

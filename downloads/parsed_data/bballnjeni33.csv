         A few highlights nd an example of wht we dd was ""buddy""...Buddy was part of the team 2...he was a heavy punching bag that had 2 b carried around evrywer nd b part of the team in most of the activities...the one thing that sticks out the most in mai mind was wen coach put 2 stools next 2 eachother nd put a piece of tape across them...we were all supposed 2 go over the tape without touching it or we ran nd had 2 start all over again....nd we had 2 all stay connected....nd buddy had 2 cum over with us....well the first one wasnt 2 hard nd we went over ok nd just had 2 run once....but then the tape moved to the top of the stools nd that was way above our knees nd ther was no way 2 jump over especially w/ buddy....so we had 2 think of sumthing.....o nd lilas little nephew, betito/petito/franky/gordo/alberto, was also included....so we figured...we get the ladder thing a coupla yards from us, bring it baq, climb up nd jump over....simple right? well the first time we tried, we had ta run cuz we wernt connected... so we tried holding hands nd walking 2gether over 2 wer it was nd tried pickng it up....that was hard cuz we had 2 stay connected...but we finally got it over ther nd started going over the tape....it was working out pretty well....till sum 1 got disconnected or touched the tape er sumthin like that....so we ran nd thot up a better idea....we got the bench on the football field nd brought it over2 go under the tape so we culd step over....so that worked well...until sum 1 got disconnected...so we ran nd that was that cuz we were running outta time 
        well i culd write sooo much more about the memories mnd stuff but ill jus stick with wht happened 2day.....well it was the last day so we ended practice half an hour early nd got the bbq started...so we got out 2 the field nd hav the bbq nd eat all the junk...well we decided a cupla days ago 2 get coach baq 4 making us go through the week....so marilyn nd lila brought water ballons nd a squirt gun.....so after we had all eaten we made a plan 2 fake an injury nd get coach aver ther so we culd get him....we started playing freeze tag....so jasmin fell nd we all gathered round to make it look like coach had 2 cum over.....o cheese it was sooooo hard not 2 laff!....neways....coach got ther nd we starteds throwing water balloons....that was alot of fun=D....hehehe he sed he knew we were faking all along...but i seriously doubt that...neways....o his baby was ther nd hes sooo cute!! we had 2 make sur him nd mrs v werent in the way of the balloons but it all worked out ok^^ 
        o yea.....mai schedule....omgsh....tis so screwed up...i went 2 the repair day thing b4 practice but mai schedules still screwed up cuz all the classes i need r in the same period!! cheese......but i wont write more now...ive dun enuff'=)</STRONG></FONT>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""4th year running""><b>1. What did you do in 2006 that you'd never done before?</b>
I lived with a significant other for a significant period of time (3 months). Although, I would argue that it wasn't quite the same as actually living together because, despite his best efforts, it was still his place and I was just visiting.


<b>2. Did you keep your New Years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b>
I don't remember what my resolutions were. I smoked drunk at at party this fall, and got sick of them, so I'm fairly certain that's my last time.


<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b>
No.


<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b>
No.


<b>5. What places did you visit?</b>
I stayed in the states throughout 2006! I drove between LA and San Francisco a few times, and did a cross-country road trip with Lizzy, where I visited a bunch of states for the first time.


<b>6. What would you like to have in 2007 that you lacked in 2006?</b>
Security. Knowing a little more about the details of my future.


<b>7. What date from 2006 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b>
This is simultaneously cheesy and nerdy: the day Matt invited me to be his girlfriend on facebook, because until that point, I figured the charade was going to end once winter break was over. But putting it out there for ""the world"" to see meant something was just starting up. Also, our first ""I love you""s.


<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b>
Having some great performances this summer, and dipping below 150.


<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b>
Gaining it back, and not going out enough with friends.


<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b>
Just the usual. Some days the motivation is just not there; I need to be better at faking myself out!

<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b>
Nothing stands out. A ticket to Austria for summer 2007!


<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b>
Matt's: he's been my rock, confidante, shoulder and punching bag. Eve's: we really began to get for-better-or-for-worse sisterly this year, and I think that'll stick for quite a while.


<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b>
My own: I let myself go a little, and I didn't just accept and pick up the pieces. I need to get better at stopping avalanches of depression. I've got to recognize the patterns, Matt might say!

Also, half of myself is across the country. I'm trying to live my life where I am, but I (happily, lovingly, without a second thought) invest a lot of time in cultivating this long-distance relationship, to the detriment of some of my second-tier relationships here in Pittsburgh. My guess is that, with more time next semester, it won't be quite so bad.

Sheree's: Hhr attitude brought us all down during <i>A Little Night Music</i>, and although she's falling, we just can't give her the answers she needs. Hopefully, she'll find the confidence she needs inside herself. And hopefully she'll find joy in *something*.


<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b>
Plane tickets. Concert tickets! Matt and I saw a bunch of concerts this summer and into the fall. I figured it was my consolation prize for not going out of the country at all.


<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b>
Getting into BASOTI. Not quite as prestigious as I'd hoped once I got there, but hey, a gig's a gig, and I rocked it better than most of the people out there.


<b>16. What song will always remind you of 2006?</b>
Crazy - Gnarles Barkley


<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you</b>

<b>i. happier or sadder?</b> happier.

<b>ii. thinner or fatter?</b> same. soon I'll be thinner!

<b>iii. richer or poorer?</b> n/a. I spend my parents' money still.


<b>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b>
Told people I love them, care about them, appreciate what they've done for me and what they've taught me.


<b>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b>
POUTING. Being depressed, lazy, directionless. Being emotional. Some days I wish I could just stonewall it all.


<b>20. How did you spend Christmas?</b>
It'll be with the Beall extended family at the Beall house in Palos Verdes.


<b>21. How will you be spending New Year's?</b>
With the remaining family and Matt at Buca di Beppo's? That seems to be the plan at the moment.


<b>22. Did you fall in love in 2006?</b>
over and over again :)


<b>23. How many one-night stands?</b>
no more!


<b>24. What was your favorite TV program?</b>
err ... I just caught myself up on all three seasons of Desperate Housewives in less than 2 months ...


<b>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</b>
No.


<b>26. What was the best book you read?</b>
Sigh. Read so few books. Don't laugh .... probably <i>10 Minute Abs</i>. It really works (if you actually do the exercises)!


<b>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b>
The joy of singing with great technique, even if it means I can't be as dramatic. Technique itself actually can be emotionally fulfilling!


<b>28. What did you want and get?</b>
Material crap. Roles in shows. 


<b>29. What did you want and not get?</b>
Motivation. But like I'm learning, it's not just gonna strike me if I sit around. I have kick myself in the ass for a while before motivation starts making its home in my heart again.


<b>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b>
Well, *not* <i>The Fountain</i>. <i>Happy Feet</i> was really cute, but had non-kid themes that made it a touch of creepy. <i>Wordplay</i> was fun, and got me into crosswords for 5 minutes, until I realized how bad I am at them. Also saw <i>Vertigo</i> and <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> with Matt at the Stanford, which was fun.


<b>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b>
I'll be 21! Gonna go out with family, who will be obligated to buy me good drinks.


<b>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b>
Probably ... a way to spend nights with Matt. Transporter?


<b>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2003?</b>
What's clean? I was a closet (as in secret) slob this year.


<b>34. What kept you sane?</b>
Coffee? Although that probably didn't help, really. Matt. Random nights out with people.


<b>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b>
Er, Justin Timberlake, but only because of that fantastic SNL Christmas episode.


<b>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</b>
Get Santorum out of office.


<b>37. Who did you miss?</b>
Do I need to sound like a broken record here? I missed Lizzy too, especially since she's a phone person and I'm an internet person, and I go to bed at 10 and she's an all-nighter.


<b>38. Who was the best new person you met?</b>
My little, Kelly :) Probably all the new people I met through SAI ... I can't really think of any other new people I've met :P

Oh, BASOTI people! Brian Hotchkin ... he's on the up-and-up.


<b>38.b. Side question...who would you like to get to know better?</b>
All my voice kids, while there's still the chance. I can't wait to see what's in store for all of us!


<b>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2006:</b>
Don't give up hope yet ... God has a plan for you.


<b>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year: </b>
""Home could be the Pennsylvania turnpike / Indiana's early morning dew / high up in the hills of California / home is just another word for you."""

"event","<lj-cut text=""This is the third year in a row I've done this."">
<b>1. What did you do in 2005 that you'd never done before?</b>
I had a recital.
I organized and headed a benefit concert -- made some real change in the world.
I saw my dad looking absolutely helpless.  
I made my professional operatic debut.
I saw how much one person touched other people's lives -- and how much it hurt everyone to have him gone.

<b>2. Did you keep your New Years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b>
I don't even remember what they were, so I probably didn't keep them.  On the other hand, I bet they're the same every year, so that means I don't keep them, doesn't it?

<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b>
No.

<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b>
Mikey.  Mikeymikeymikeymikeymikey.

<b>5. What places did you visit?</b>
Los Angeles, Berlin, the coast of the Baltic Sea in Poland, DC, New York City

<b>6. What would you like to have in 2006 that you lacked in 2005?</b>
Drive to learn more music more quickly.  To internalize music, get myself away from the sheet music faster so I can make it my own.

<b>7. What date from 2005 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b>
The day I got a call from Mark Trawka:
""Our soprano got sick -- can you fill in?  Tomorrow?""
""Sure!  Of course I know all those songs!"" (...)
And then getting paid by Pittsburgh Opera.  At 19.

<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b>
Learning to love the music -- the theory, the ensemble -- instead of the sound.  Also, learning to embrace and channel different sounds from my one pair of chords.  We are not, and should not be, married/chained to one style or sound.

<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b>
Smoking in Berlin.  What the fuck.

<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b>
Nothing out of the ordinary.

<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b>
My new laptop/iPod combination?

<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b>
Everyone in A Chorus Line, who stuck through it and put on a good show dispite all the negative energy from Drama and within.

<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b>
Marcin's whole outlook on life and love and girls was so depressing that I couldn't actually believe -- and kept hanging out with him because I was certain he'd turn around one day and say ""gotcha!  of course I don't actually think this way!""  But he never did.

<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b>
On tickets I never used.  On useless shit.

<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b>
Surprising myself.  Kicking high and getting a pick-up in tap.  Getting the soprano role in a 4-person opera.  Getting mistaken for a german girl on the U-bahn and being complimented on my Aussprache (accent) by native speakers.

<b>16. What song will always remind you of 2005?</b>
Stuff by Fettes Brot and Silbermond.  The song list I made for my early-morning U-bahn rides from Prenzl'berg to Charlottenburg (Marcin's apartment to mine).

<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you</b>
<b>i. happier or sadder?</b> same.  perhaps sadder but wiser.
<b>ii. thinner or fatter?</b> thinner.
<b>iii. richer or poorer?</b> this question still doesn't pertain to me, as I'm not financially independent.

<b>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b>
Kayaking in Idaho.  That was blim-blam-azing.  Beautiful and pictureque, and fun to hang out with my extended family.

<b>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b>
Choosing to fool around and/or hang out with people when I knew it was in my best interest to study/work/sleep.

<b>20. How did you spend Christmas?</b>
I'll be spending it with my family in Los Angeles.  I think it's going to be pretty low-key; not many cousins are coming since we all met up for Thanksgiving.

<b>21. How will you be spending New Year's?</b>
Dunno.  Celebrating my 20th birthday -- the end of adolescence.  I'll never be awkward ever, ever again.

<b>22. Did you fall in love in 2005?</b>
Every year, I say I did, and when I look back I think how silly and naive I was to think that.  Guess what my answer is this year?

<b>23. How many one-night stands?</b>
OMG KEN FORGIT.  I forgot about him.  And Russell.

<b>24. What was your favorite TV program?</b>
I got addicted to Sex and the City on On Demand.

<b>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</b>
I'm not a hater.  But I don't like Russell Scharf very much.

<b>26. What was the best book you read?</b>
She's Come Undone and She Comes First, which are two entirely different books.

<b>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b>
German pop/rock and R&B.  GUSTER entered my life this year.

<b>28. What did you want and get?</b>
Into better shape.  I was proud of myself for that, although I'm not proud that I've slacked since A Chorus Line.

<b>29. What did you want and not get?</b>
A steady church gig.

<b>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b>
<a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0367652/"">Deuce Bigalo: European Gigolo</a> dubbed in German.  With a couple of German 13-year-olds on a date behind me making out and laughing at the jokes aimed at europeans.
Seriously though, maybe <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0433770/"">Allein</a> or <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0472063/"">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>.

<b>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b>
I'm turning 20.  I won't be a teenager any more.  I'll be grown up, sort of.  But everyone else will go out drinking with me.

<b>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b>
A steady singing gig.  More time to hang out with people I care about.  More performance opportunities -- preferably paying ones, but whatever.

<b>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2005?</b>
Only One Pair of Pants Fits Anymore.  Wear the Same Clothes with New Accessories and Nobody Will Notice.

<b>34. What kept you sane?</b>
Sex and the City.  (I know that's sad.)  Writing in my paper and online journals.

<b>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b>
Oh, whatever.  I dunno.  Those guys in that New Zealand comedy band, The Flight of the Concords.

<b>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</b>
I did a lot of Katrina relief-related stuff.

<b>37. Who did you miss?</b>
Whomever I wasn't around, I suppose.  I didn't do a lot of missing people this year.  It was a very independent/lonely year.  When I did miss people, I usually felt guilty about it.

<b>38. Who was the best new person you met?</b>
Marcin taught me a lot, but I don't actually like him much.  I guess, all the girls in SAI whom I've gotten to know better now.

<b>38.b. Side question...who would you like to get to know better?</b>
Ryan Leonard.

<b>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2005:</b>
People cannot be changed.  They need to be loved for their idiosyncracies.
Not all idiosyncracies are worth forgiving.
Love cannot be forced between two people.
Love is not dead, but there are people who are not willing to welcome it into their hearts.

<b>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year: </b>
""I'm off on a rocketship prepared for something new / I'm off on a rocketship ecstatic with the view / I am scared for the things upcoming / and I want for the things I don't have / cannot stand to be one of many / I'm not what they are""
Guster - Rocketship"

<lj-cut text=""lyrics"">I heard that it's the 24th of June
A very special day indeed
It means that the girl whose nose I stuck beans in
Is turning 18
So I wrote you a song to say
Whoopitydoo
PS Sorry about the beans

Chorus:
Happy Birthday Lizzy
it's been 18 years since you were born
Happy Birthday Lizzy
now you can buy yourself cigarettes and porn

You can go out and vote
You can buy some blue spray paint
and you don't have to listen to Dad
oh Lizzy
it's the day you were born

[short instrumental]

I heard that you lost your wallet
And all your forms of ID
Which means that you can't really do yet
What you're supposed to do when you turn 18
So I'll send you my license
Via super-fast jet
'Cause you look a lot like me

Happy Birthday Lizzy
it's been 18 years since you were born
Happy Birthday Lizzy

"event","<lj-cut text=""2004""><b>1. What did you do in 2004 that you'd never done before?</b>
Live with two guys that aren't related to me.  And cook on a somewhat regular basis.


<b>2. Did you keep your New Years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b>
I again don't remember what my New Years' resolutions were, but mine for this year will be to lose some weight because it'll improve my grade in dance, and to quit smoking while drunk.


<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b>
Nope.


<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b>
Nope


<b>5. What places did you visit?</b>
Munich and Trinidad over the summer, LA for part of the summer and over Thanksgiving and Winter Breaks.  I had hoped to go to London, but that didn't happen.  Now I'm hoping to go over Spring Break, but if people keep being apathetic on both ends, the whole idea might go bust.


<b>6. What would you like to have in 2005 that you lacked in 2004?</b>
The ability to commit -- to things, people, majors, etc.


<b>7. What date from 2004 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b>
Election day.  


<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b>
Composing.  Actually practicing with some regularity.  Feeling like a bonafide musician for the first time in my life, rather than just a kid who likes singing.

Also -- looking, feeling and sounding older, more grown-up.  Feeling very emotionally healthy.


<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b>
Smoking while drunk.  Still being LOUD.


<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b>
Making out with people at parties is not a problem, but I need to learn to time it all better, so that when I inevitably get sick after kissing new people, I don't have any performances coming up.  

I also need to get my wisdom teeth out, since they've been aching on and off since June.


<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b>
A big green couch for Bloodshaw Manor.  A large Hello-Kitty's-bag-worth of alcohol in the Frankfurt airport (which I then took on the plane, clinking and clanking the whole way).


<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b>
The voice majors, for becoming such a family.  Our Secret Santa party this Monday, we had sangria and cheese, and it was the first time I ever got pleasantly buzzed and really enjoyed myself without being too stupid -- although, even sober I'm fairly silly, so that was all amplified.


<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b>
S'n'S drrrrrramaaaa (well, since the end of the summer).  I still believe there are a lot of interesting people in that group, but as a whole, the politics are too damn much.


<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b>
On a ticket that I never used.


<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b>
Finishing my first year of college.  Germany.  Living off campus and throwing parties.


<b>16. What song will always remind you of 2004?</b>
selections from ""Dies Irae""


<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you</b>
<b>i. happier or sadder?</b>  HAPPIER.  I think it has to do with living with two people who enjoy life.  Last year was rough.
<b>ii. thinner or fatter?</b>  I don't really know.  I think I wear more flattering clothes this year.
<b>iii. richer or poorer?</b>  Richer?  Not much; I've taken on two jobs, but I only work about 10 hours total a week.

<b>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b>
Stayed outdoors, especially in Germany.  Spent time with important people before it was too late.  Washed my clothes and cleaned my room!


<b>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b>
Talking, being too loud, saying too much.


<b>20. How did you spend Christmas?</b>
Christmas is at my mom's parents' house this year.  Everyone's coming over, it'll be like old times except that my cousin's parents are separated.  Oh, life.


<b>21. How will you be spending New Year's?</b>
Same way I do every year -- celebrating my birthday.  This year, it may be with my high school friends, recording more Spatata greatness.


<b>22. Did you fall in love in 2004?</b>
Almost.  Maybe.  No.  I can't fall in love -- I'm too busy talking too much and being scared to commit.


<b>23. How many one-night stands?</b>
Oof.  Well, three.  But one was two weeks long.  And one was a threesome.

[Edit:  Wait, does one-night stand imply sex?  Because that changes my answer.  Eh.  ""I may be down, but I'm not flat as all that.""]


<b>24. What was your favorite TV program?</b>
Drawn Together!  Also watching the Steelers not suck.


<b>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</b>
Certainly not.  I don't think anyone could do anything to me that I wouldn't forgive eventually.


<b>26. What was the best book you read?</b>
Man.  I really didn't read enough this year.  Tuesdays with Morrie, maybe?  The Five People You Meet in Heaven?  Both by the same author, both contrived, both made me cry.


<b>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b>
Understanding and genuinely beginning to like ""modern"" (ie. turn-of-the-20th century) music -- and even beginning to compose in said style.  Thanks, Counterpoint!  I'm now tackling tone-row theory.


<b>28. What did you want and get?</b>
I said I wanted ass last year, and I got it.  Boy.  At least I've been safe.


<b>29. What did you want and not get?</b>
To stay with Matt for longer than I did.


<b>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b>
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  Because everything reminds me of you and I can't stand it, I want you wiped from my mind.  I'm impulsive.


<b>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b>
New Year's Eve, buddy.  I'll be 19 and probably recording music.


<b>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b>
Quick, cheap transportation from Pittsburgh to London.


<b>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2004?</b>
80's dancer chick.  Cut-up t-shirts and short skirts with tights.  All I need are some leg warmers, and I'm set.  In general, I'm looking older -- rarely the glasses, more attention to hair and make-up usually, and the shower is always free when I'm getting ready for class.


<b>34. What kept you sane?</b>
Keeping a schedule that I could stick to.  Relying on myself instead of outsourcing.


<b>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b>
Who cares?  I didn't really like anyone.


<b>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</b>
The election, which has gotten me more politically active than I've ever been before.  And it changed my perception of people I had previously considered upstanding people.


<b>37. Who did you miss?</b>
Matt, for a while.  Now I really only miss him when I talk to him on the phone, which is not often.  Also, my sister.  I miss my sister.


<b>38. Who was the best new person you met?</b>
Various members of Scotch'n'Soda were simultenously the best and worst new people I've met this year.  Some of them are so utterly talented.

Unfortunately, I haven't made any new close friends this year.  I wish I had.  Although, I do feel a lot closer to many voice majors, particularly Eve and Sarah.


<b>38.b. Side question...who would you like to get to know better?</b>
The new faces of Scotch'n'Soda, the ones who are still having fun without being exclusionary -- the ones who will be the movers and shakers next year.


<b>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2004:</b>
Not only do I not *have* to be in a relationship to feel happy, I don't *want* to be in a relationship.  Also, random hook-ups may be good up front, but on the whole they make you feel empty.  It's too bad.


<b>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:</b>

<b>1. What did you do in 2003 that you'd never done before?</b>
I broke my previous record for longest time away from home (previous time: 7.5 weeks -- this time: 5.5 months), and funny thing - once I got back to LA, I realized home had mysteriously become Pittsburgh.

I also performed on stage at the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion in LA, which was the first time I ever got paid to sing.


<b>2. Did you keep your New Years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</b>
I didn't make any New Year's resolutions this year, at least not any that I can remember (so I must not have done a very good job of keeping them ...).  I was probably too hung up on college apps (ha!).


<b>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</b>
Nope.


<b>4. Did anyone close to you die?</b>
Nope.  I'm dreading it.


<b>5. What places did you visit?</b>
On the first day of 2003, I was in Cambodia, as part of a trip to Thailand to visit my grandparents.  (Grandpa just retired, decided to volunteer for Doctors Without Borders, got stationed in Thailand for a year so we had Christmas there.  Currently, they are stationed in China after a 9-month break in the states.)

I was supposed to go to Austria over spring break with my school choir, but the trip got cancelled thanks to a man named George W and his propensity for war.

A week after graduation, I spent 9 weeks in Aspen this summer learning how to sing with 20-somethings and wrecking my voice in the damn children's chorus in La Boheme.  I got to work with Julius Rudel, and it was all free, so I suppose it was all worth it.  It was lonely, and I spent a lot of my time at the Pitkin County Library.  Go me.

I came home for 1.5 days, packed and left my life in LA for a life in Pittsburgh.  It was rough.  I missed my entire summer-after-graduation experience.  Oh well.


<b>6. What would you like to have in 2004 that you lacked in 2003?</b>
Ass.  Seriously.  It's time to get this college experience in gear.


<b>7. What date from 2003 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</b>
May 24, 2003.  Prom.  (Aww, cute little high school senior memory ...)
For all my pre-prom planning, the night went perfectly, and all my friends and I had the most perfect prom of our lives, which is not to say pretty and glamorous and oh-who-are-you-wearing?, but more what we did after prom, with Twister and gift-giving and IHOP the next day.  For one night, we were all best friends and would never leave LA and would just be kids forever and ever.  Because we all knew where we were going to college, and prom was the only thing that was saving us from thinking of graduation.  And graduation was The End.

Anyway.  I know we'll all remember it as one of *the* happy memories of high school.

Plus, I had a big crush on my prom date and he felt the same way and it was mushy and warm and comfortable and nice.  It never went anywhere after prom because he decided he didn't like me after all.  And now he lives on the same floor as me, so yaaay for life.


<b>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</b>
Graduating.  Slipping a gummy worm to the headmaster as he shook my hand and handed me my diploma.  (Last year they slipped him condoms, and the year before that, porno playing cards.  I think he was relieved at our choice of prank.)

But.  Also not chickening out on my Independent Study and actually finishing the concert, and the paper, despite all the shit the committee gave me before, during and after.  Ugh.


<b>9. What was your biggest failure?</b>
Letting Justin get to me so fucking much.  My life should be about meeeee.


<b>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</b>
I bruised my knee and got some minor burns when Grandma Betty (my beloved 93 Honda Accord) was totaled in January.  My sister broke her right arm, left forefinger and possibly a collarbone.  She couldn't write in school for months, and I still feel like a shmuck, even though the police report says the other driver was responsible.


<b>11. What was the best thing you bought?</b>
The gifts I got everyone for prom -- everyone chipped in for them but the cost was heavily subsidised by my Spotlight Award money.  Now there's a chunk of change I wouldn't mind having nowadays.


<b>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</b>
My parents, being able to let go.  God knows it was hard for me.  The day my mom left in August, we hugged and she said ""now go"" and I had to force myself not to look back at her and I cried a little (just like I'm doing now, remembering it - no kidding, a tear down each cheek).  I am almost sickeningly maudlin.    


<b>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</b>
Whenever I was around him too much, my dad.  While I'm living at home, he's too much to handle.  In small doses, like when he comes out to visit me in Pittsburgh, he can be alright.


<b>14. Where did most of your money go?</b>
Buying food when I'm already on a mealplan, both in Aspen this summer and in Pittsburgh.  But mostly in Aspen.

And, buying ""winter"" clothes that I really ""need"" (like running shoes).


<b>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</b>
College.  All summer, that's what kept me from going insane.  And really, I kind of went insane anyway.


<b>16. What song will always remind you of 2003?</b>
In da Club -- 50 cent  (Isn't that sad?  They played 50 billion times at grad night.)


<b>17. Compared to this time last year, are you</b>

<b>i. happier or sadder?</b>  so much happier -- no apps to think about (well, RA app but that doesn't count)

<b>ii. thinner or fatter?</b>  er ... more muscle, so smaller pant size but I weight more.  whatever.

<b>iii. richer or poorer?</b>  I still don't make enough of my own money to be able to answer that question.

<b>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</b>
Going out with friends more before going to college.  I kind of regret going to Aspen for as long as I did, although it was a great learning experience.  Going out with friends now feels different -- I'm different.  


<b>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</b>
Sitting on my ass in front of the computer stuck inside in my teeny room in Aspen on a gorgeous day when I could be outside reading or hiking or doing *anything* else.


<b>20. How did you spend Christmas?</b>
It was boring, honestly.  We broke a lot of traditions this year and had a quiet Christmas at home with no cousins and my dad's grandparents.


<b>21. How will you be spending New Year's?</b>
Celebrating my 18th birthday with Amanda and Co.!  Woop!


<b>22. Did you fall in love in 2003?</b>
Yes.  Well, kind of.  It was some sort of love, but even now I can't tell what category/genre/type of love I want or am supposed to feel for this person.  ""Fall in love"" is such a disgustingly simple term.


<b>23. How many one-night stands?</b>
One two-night stand.  At least, that's all it's been so far.


<b>24. What was your favorite TV program?</b>
Daily Show.  My TV-watching hours have plummeted severely.


<b>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</b>
Hate is just an inability to understand.


<b>26. What was the best book you read?</b>
this summer's installment of Harry Potter.  duh.


<b>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</b>
Michelle Branch, for the lyrics especially


<b>28. What did you want and get?</b>
Independence


<b>29. What did you want and not get?</b>
Let's be superficial: an A in Harmony.


<b>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</b>
Every movie I saw this year was my favorite.  Except for American Wedding.  That was not.


<b>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</b>
Hasn't happened yet, but it's always the best night of the year: 12/31.  I'll be 18.


<b>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</b>
closure.  and more self-confidence at the beginning of the school year.


<b>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2003?</b>
Warmth!  Also, trying vaguely to feel older.


<b>34. What kept you sane?</b>
iTunes.  no joke.


<b>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</b>
Jimmy Fallon.  Mmm, gimme somma that.
 

<b>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</b>
""Operation Freedom""/""War On Terror""/Whatever we were calling it this year.


<b>37. Who did you miss?</b>
Parents, sister, high school friends.


<b>38. Who was the best new person you met?</b>
Everyone.  A whole new atmosphere, it's awesome.


<b>38.b. Side question...who would you like to get to know better?</b>
Heh.  lalala...


<b>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2003:</b>
The only person I can reliably depend on is myself.


<b>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year: </b>
""Goodbye to you/Goodbye to everything that I knew/you were the one I loved/the one thing that I tried to hold on to"""

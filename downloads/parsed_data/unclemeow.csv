"event","I hate those stupid T-Shirts that are suppossed to be witty. Like: ""North Korea's got Seoul"" or like ""Cinco de mayo"" And then there are five cans of mayonaise. Wow, witty, cool. You're so individualistic that you buy a shirt with a saying you didn't make up yourself.

Anyone who wears these shirts are automatically minused 10 points on my respect level.

Lmfao I actually like the camoflauge ""HA! Now you can't see me!"" I'm so ghetto hahahah"

"event","so im in school right now and im supposed to be doing work. nope, not doing that.

summer is awesome, and i am basically on summer vacation right now. this is because i spend a lot more time with my friends and swimming in peoples pools than i do homework or school. the weather has been so nice lately that i just cant contain myself and i feel obligated (compelled) to lay in the sun and spend time with mary. nothing wrong with that.


nothing wrong with mary.

there is just something about mary.



i need a name for my piece. suggestions? 

^^^karly suggested Richard. and i kind of like that because i can call him Dick for short. SUCK DICK. hahahah. 

please, if you ave seen my piece, give me a suggestion. the winner of this contest will receive a reward, in the form of smoke.


i love summer.

this entry is mainly to waste time in the class that i am in right now, which is short story. we have a sub, his name is Nick Adams, and i think he is pretty hot. 

today i am going shopping with sophie after school and then to the girls lax game. i think i have a lot of homework, but that doesnt matter right now. 

i love summer.
later, leah"

"event","i went to my camp last night with ""the crew"" as luke put it. we had a good time, but around 10 we decided to send a scout to check out casey ginn's party. they said it was decent so we cleaned up and left. it was actually very decent, i like being outside when its nice out and there is a roaring bonfire, it makes it seem more and more like summer. so we hung out there for a while. shitty though that i saw courtney, kristen, and halb for only like a minute...they were leaving as i was arriving. 

overall, it was a good night. but im making up for it right now. i feel sick."

"event","i was in a pretty good mood today. i did all of my homework last night and so i left school last period because i felt like i deserved it. i hung out with a shitload of people at my house, i dont remember who really...courtney, kristen, wilcox, dudley, allie, christie, josh neilson, jimmy, will...i think that was it. i dont know. it was fun, kristen and i jumped on my trampoline.

whatthefucksup with this weather were having? god needs to decide whether its going to be sunny, or rainy...not both at the same time...it screws with my mind. 

i went to the girls lax game today and hung out with some parents, really awkward. adam showed up to watch rachelle, so i hung out with him a bit. i walked home because i dont have a license. :(





ahhh final episode of the oc. there will be girls galore at my house in about 2 hours. maybe sophie will come? i dont know if shes mad at me or not. i dont like that. i think she might be pretty pissed at me, but she might show up at my house...?

later, leah


ps TOMORROW IS FRIDAY! party at casey ginn's pit...wherever the fuck that is? RAGER"

"event","im going through a modest mouse phase. i have been repeating one song over and over for a few days now. it happens to me all the time with various assortments of music. this time it just happens to be modest mouse and the song is gravity rides everything. ive been mainly listening to blind melon, spoon, built to spill, the shins, and modest mouse for the past week. i made a wondrous playlist of those bands.

movies i want to see soon:
mystic pizza
amelie
better than sex
dead poets society
punch drunk love
american beauty
amittyville horror (i LOVE scary movies)

^^add some to the ""to watch"" list


the art show is this week:
1. do not expect to see me after school as i will be locked away finishing my self portrait
2. mr.franklin may kill me if i dont finish
3. i probably wont finish
4. i need some words of encouragement 
5. if you go to greely, be sure to look for my paintings and pottery in the library this week

time for bed

"event","just taking a break from my homework. thought id do something productive for a minute or two, instead of only sitting. 

i watched coffee and cigarettes last night, its quite good, you should watch it. it really made me want a butt the entire time though, because it really glamorizes the common addictions to coffee/caffine and cigarettes. 

i had hockey today and because im a slacker i didnt stay to skate with the boys. im also not in good enough shape to keep up with them, so maybe next week, after i exercise a bit more. my shoulders are sore...what the fuck? i need a massage

my parents are leaving me alone this friday because they are going to a bosox game...im mad that im not going, but happy that i can do whatever i please...which will be something fun, you can count on it. 

ok, back to work. (homework)

"event","well i finished my research paper for contemporary novel. yus. it feels really good to complete something and know that you worked hard on it.

yeah...that was sappy.


its so weird not being able to drive places. im a lot less social now, but its only been a few days, ill get back into it soon enough. then its drinking and NOT driving. i think im extremely against it now, not just because i got caught (for the record i wasent even drunk), but because its a stupid idea to consume any amount of alcohol and then drive no matter what. seriously, either stay where you are or have someone who hasent had anything to drink drive you home. im not saying youll get in an accident if youve had a few beers, im saying that the cops in cumberland are fuckers and will follow you until you ""do something wrong"" and make up a bullshit reason why they pulled you over. then theyll ""smell alcohol"" and tell you that they are going to search your car. im speaking from experience, just dont do it. thanks.

today was kind of chilly, but i enjoyed the sun. it put me in a good mood.

i was supposed to meet with mr. kenny today but i didnt go. as he wrote in the note that he sent to me, we are ""long overdue for a check-up"" during which i will say nothing to him while he tells me that i have a drug/alcohol problem (untrue) and offers me snacks that have been sitting in his office for years. i will then procede to tell him nothing for the remainder of the period so i dont have to go back to math. hes a nice guy, but i dont need to see him. i can handle my life, its hard, but i manage.

sophie came over and we watched Next on mtv for 2 hours. so fun. 


tomorrow is friday. im hoping this weekend will be fun.

"event","i went to court today and i was really nervous. the judge basically said that he liked me, that i ""wasent a bad kid"" and that i didnt deserve what he had to give me, but im still losing my license for a year and a half (what the fuck?). thats 18 months which is 548 days. shit. thats alot. 
if every goes as officer martin plans, i wont be getting my license back until i am in college. well at least by then i wont be living anywhere near ryan martin and the state of maine. yus.
i do have the option of requesting a restricted license, though. but thats only for school, maybe sports, and work. (i should get a job...any suggestions?). and after 9 months (february of next year) i might be able to reinstate my license, which means i would get it back, but thats a pretty slim chance, according to my lawyer.
ANYWAY.
shitloads of schoolwork to do this week and next, and the next. 
and the next.
i am pretty much taking it up the ass from life right now. it sucks. but i have hope...sort of.




i hear the ice cream truck. werd.

peace."

"event","complaining, something i hate. but for the time being i am going to complain. because i have a lot to complain about.
i have to go to court tomorrow and im feeling very sad about it, because i could possibly lose my license for a very long time ( 1 1/2 years) and that would be very very annoying, because all of my friends would be able to drive, but i will still need rides from my parents. woo. i guess its good that i wont ever have to be dd for the rest of my high school days. also halb said that she could cart me around...i think ill stick to people who arent crazy...but it was a nice thought. 

i think ill stop writing on that good note...

"event","well i finally have a livejournal and i pretty much just made it for courtney...so she better be happy!
i went for a drive with her today into falmouth to walmart. its probably going to be my last day of driving because the state of maine thinks its funny to take kids licenses away for a year and a half, when they really didnt do anything. FUCK the police.
 
anyway, i have determined that i have bad luck. the end.

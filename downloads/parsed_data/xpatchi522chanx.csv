"event","<font color=""#ff99cc"">I went to a friend's b-day, today. :3 We played football, baseball, pinata (I gots a lot of candy :3), water guns, trampoline boxing, and a lot more. Great food. Cake~ I tested a theory I heard about. I took some gum, and started chewing it. Soon,&nbsp;I put some chocolate and started chewing it to. And soon, the chocolate <em>and</em> gum dissolved! XD It was fun~ Although, we did get lost on the way home for 5 minutes.... &gt;.&gt; And we saw this poor roadkill raccoon. ;_;&nbsp;Poor thing. Also, I thank Nuki for hooking me on Foamy the Squirrel. :3 </font>"

I stayed home today, got the 3rd Pure Heart in Super Paper Mario today. :3 I went to the park with my cousins. And OMG, it was disgusting! D: There were pigeons and duck and geese and miles and <em>miles</em> of crap everywhere! &gt;_&lt; But, we saw a beaver~&nbsp; ^o^ And some black girl left her cell phone near&nbsp;us&nbsp;when&nbsp;she went to play. o.o Someone could of stole it! We took it and opened it, but it was off, so we put it back. XD It was fun~ And I have 2 puppies in my lap who are trying to get out of my grip. WELL, I'M NOT LETTING GO YOU CUTE WIDDLE THINGS! &gt;:O</font>"

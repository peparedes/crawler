I saw 7 pounds for the second time too and it made me feel sadder than it did the first time. I talk to this person in south dakota somewhere, don't even know how old or what sex they are but they seem perfect. Its prolly some pedobear or something but not knowing is the best part heh. ""you'd skip your early classes, and we'd learn how our bodies worked"" Living life with a purpose...whats mine? I keep hoping that something miraculous will happen each day...a divine intervention to point me towards my destination, like the floor signs in IKEA. 


And if you knew just how I felt, you could kill me, with just one look."

"event","Hello. It's been a while i guess i can say. See that i havent been on this site in over a decade and all.
I would tell you that i've been busy..but i cant since the play ended saturday and lacrosse doesnt start till spring..so i'm pretty much free.
Believe it or not.  
I've lost 12lbs and i'm very proud of myself..but i'm hoping to lose more. Not really sure how that's gonna happen..but it may.  
Right now i feel so down..so blue..
 I've got this song stuck in my head and i'll say that well..it pretty much will cover all of my emotions of this day..and well probably the rest of my life:

When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself
Anymore

When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
Oh
Don't wanna live
By myself, by myself
Anymore
By myself
Anymore
Oh
All by myself
Don't wanna live
I never, never, never
Needed anyone

There now you kno.  I dont like anyone, funny to say. And i dont want to be alone anymore. I mean i will. because i can. but i dont like it.
Jordan and Aaron are so lucky to have each other. I honestly get jealous sometimes because of their love.  They love each other soo much and everyone can see it! 
But dont worry all..this'll pass. It always does, and i'll feel better.
Maybe i'll go run. Yea maybe i will. lol
Luv ya'll!*   *mwah*

"event","Wow it has been soo long since i've written. and from what i can c this site has really made a few changes! lol if it werent for ashley, i probably wouldnt be updating now! lol
well I'm not sure where i left off, because i havent read the past few enteries yet but that can wait.
I just woke up to hearing my 3 brothers down stairs yelling at the tv because their game on the ps2, lol they're so dumb. but u gotta love em.
Yesterday, I went over to Ryans house to hangout for a few minutes, hours, whatever...and it was like 11:30 and i was hoping that he was up and so i knock on the door and he answers after like 3 min. of waiting, and he's still in his pj's with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders and mustard smeared up the side on his lip! it was soo funny, if ya would've saw you probably would've pee'd your pants! lol so i just kinda stood outside his door. and we were talking and i finally go...well are u gonna let me in? he was like umm..yea...and  walk in and his dog annie attacks me with a bunch of kisses! lol ((love that dog!)) and he asks his mom if i can come in and she's like...noo, ande i'm still in my nightgown..i was like oh thats okay. but i left anyway.
So I came back home and watched the secret window for the first time.. it wasnt that scary, altho i did jump a few times! lol it was confusing at the beginning! haha..i thought i had put the wrong dvd in.
but than i got up and cooked 2 differnet kinds of cookies..only 1 cookie came out good..and the other..well lets just say they were a bit on the crispy side. lol.
But yea thats pretty much what i did yesterday nothing fancy or nothing. just sorta a lazy day! yeayea!  
For all that didnt kno! on my brothers 6th birthday we got a puppy!!!
He's a beagle ((sp.ck)) and his name is parker.
My mom named him because earnie was trying to name him spiderman! wierd-wierd!
Last week on wednesday, i went to the corner dellie ((sp.ck)) with her and her youth group and we ate there ((obviously)) and the next day i woke up and went to school.((it was cowboy day or sumfin)) and i wore this multi-color shirt. well me and  a few frineds were walking to our 1st period and i had a mental break down..I was freaking out. My mom said it was from all the stress that i have, but who knows.
I was freaking out because every few steps i'd take i'd c some chick with the same shirt on as me! lol pretty lame i kno. but hey what can i say. I ended up puking in the student parking lot and called my mom to go home. she didnt pick me up until 3rd period and i felt so nasty!
I went home and watched tv and slept thrusday and friday. I missed 2 tests that i ended up making up that tuesday. bombed both of em! lol
I found out monday that i had food poisoning over the last few days that i was sick. it was from the mayonaise. :Mental note to self: never eat there again. lol
but yea latley ive had rehersal for the play 'its a wonderful life' and i go all the time just i always end up sitting there. it sux, coz than i have to waite 1-1 1/2 hours for my mom to come and pick me up. it really sux.
But its almost over.
Latley I've been writting a book. Im not really sure what its going to be called yet. but i'm on the 8th chapter and no where near finished. lol
oh well..i guess i just gotta keep going.....-JUST KEEP SWIMMING, JUST KEEP SWIMMING, JUST KEEP SWIMMING SWIMMING SWIMMING, WHAT DO WE DO, WE SWIM SWIM SWIM- huhhhhhhhhhhhh finally got that out! lol

Good times* but than we left to pikes peak and there was nooo spots left so we went around to look for a camp site and found one a few miles away called J-wood..it was really nice we werent around anyone..and we walked through a corn field! lol just for a little bit tho. haha
Than we went out to watch the barges pass through which was really boring at first but than when i learned alot more about it like..what its used for and what it does..i  was less bored and way more interested! 
Than we went out to eat at Misssissippi Cafe it was really good..and most of the ppl that worked there were around my age so i had fun! lol
Than we went back roasted marshmellows and mad s'mores than sat around the camp fire and  talked..about pretty much everything.
Than me and my cousin climbed into the tent and were talking when we looked up we saw the shadow of what looked to be a racoon and kinda got spooked! haha we kinda freaked..but it left and eventually fell asleep.
Woke up to hearing her mom banging on the tent really loud..it scared me at first coz it came outta no where lol
but than we got up ate breakfast got ready and went on a hiking trail..it was alot of fun! than we went to this museum (spell check)) and it was really kewl..we actually didnt get through the whole thing. So me and my cousin went out to the boat and this guy came up and started talking to us and he scared to death...he followed us for a little while than finally left us alone..he was telling us to read something and i was trying to read it..but he kept talking and i read the first sentence atleast 10 times.
We had to follow the yellow arrows it was really kewl and than when we were leaving he started following us up the walkway and finally left us alone.
But than we went on this cable car..it was really fun! and we learned about it and all and than we took a drive and we went through 3 different states in less than 1 hour! it was really kewl!
than on the way home..my uncle Dave found out that his dog died and was crying all the way home..we were all soo sad. So my uncle dave left to go get the sunday paper at the store..but that was over 4 hours ago.  I hope hes okay.
Tomorrow we're goin over to her guy friend Colins house..i've talked to him online he seems like a really nice guy.
We're watching Calender girls..it was such a cute movie! lol it was funny..but now its over so i have to go shut it off..and i have to go anyway!

Today i'm goin to one of my best frineds birfday parties and i'm sooo excited! i haevnt seen her for about a year and i wanna c how much she's changed!
Yesterday i went to an Iowa Cubs game ((baseball.to all who didnt kno)) and we left at the 8th inning coz sum old lady 2 rows infront of us snapped at my cousins for sitting in seats that wasnt assigned to them. I thought it was soo funny coz my unlce gary and her got into a real big fight..they sounded like a bunch of 5th graders. i couldnt believe that no matter how old you seem to be you still act like a little kid and grown-ups are always telling us to grow up and stop being immature when they themselves are immature as well.

I saw Bourne Supremecy yesterday with my uncle while my cousins went and saw I,Robot they said it was good..but of course they would..they think everything they see is good. lol The movie i saw was real good..but the first on Bourne Identity was alot better!
I about cried at the beginning of the movie! lol but i kept a hold of myself.haha
*You cant push a river and you cant make me fall..but you can make me unreachable.*
My nana is supposed to pick us up at 2 pm it is now 2:o4..goodness..shes late! haha
I wonder when the party starts..hmmm...hopefully not anytime soon coz i still gotta get all the way over to Des Moines and walk through that door...
But hey...the party doesnt start till I arrive! lol j/k...((or am i?))
Hmmmm lol well i gotta go..my lil bro needs to pack still..him and them stupid video games i tell you hes in a whole different world! lol 

I'll be back later to update ya'll on my exciting life!! haha

He wanted to quit coz he hated the team he was on..and well i decided to screw around and mess with him to get him all worked up! well it worked and we started wrestling i bit my tongue and kicked his side but we werent throwin any punches..he had a hold of my hair tho! lol that lasted for a lil bit and it was fun..atleast i thought soo..he stormed off and i had to go after him. but hey me and him are cool now.
So i went inside and my and my aunt watch 2 episodes of sex and the city and i came back to my room and read a lil bit of my book again..im really gettin into this book! lol its kinda wierd cozi normally dont read as much! haha

Your encouraging words always run through my head before i make a difficult decision! sounds crazy but its true!!

*Jo ""thunder thighs""...i didnt get to c much of u this summer either mainly coz u've been visiting but when i do c u..u always find ways to make the shortest time that u have the funnest! u live for each moment and i love that about u! I love hearing what u have planned for the neighborhood...(ur summer list) your soo crazy but thats why ur soo creative! i love you chick and miss u much!

*Nicole..None of us really get to c much of u in school and out! lol your soo busy but thats good..it keeps u out of trouble! lol i love being able to go to ur house when i was down and i needed to talk to someone..you always have advice ready and a story to back it up! lol When someone says ur name i remeber ur funky style that makes u stand out ((in a good way)). and how u can be soo random but somehow can stay on the same topic ((if that makes sense)). i love u girl.

*Cori...you became my best friend not right away but faster than i thought. When im with you i can say something stupid and u'll look at me laugh and say something just as dumb back! its awesome coz i know that no matter what i say u'll be able to respond back..and ur able to keep up with me. If i want to get something off my chest ur there...u know when i need to be left alone or when i need to be comforted. You know when im being serious and when im just being stupid. You remember all the little things that i need u to..but somehow forget all the big things! lol  You've taught me so much about things that i didnt even kno i needed to kno and showed me that i can do anything that i want if i work hard enough for it! i love u babe and i hope that we stick together.

*Symone...Sometimes i wonder if ur slowness has rubbed off on me! lol jk when no one was around when i needed someone you where there and u were more than willing to listen and help me! I love how u can be urself no matter who ur around. How you dont change for anybody because they dont like the way u do something or how u stick to what u want to do even if someone elses idea could have been better! Your one of a kind..never change!

*Boys-n-the-neighborhood..You guys are so different from one another! none of you are alike! and thats awesome because we all kno how to act and kno what to say if we were to ever come across someone in life thats like u.  I love that u guys know how to respect all of us..but also kno when to have fun. You guys know  that theres a time to talk and a time not to...well sometimes! lol 
You guys are always willing and ready for whatever is about to come whether its one of us that has been hurt and needs to talk or if we're on our time of the month lol and u kno that this is not a time to bring anything that may get u n trouble up! I dont kno what we would do without you. i love you guys!

*Allison...First off i want to thank you for being there when i was hurt. You always knew just what to say and just when to say it! When i would get online you would start the conversation with something that we had talked about earlier! you always made me smile even if u couldnt see me some of the time! mainly from ur unexpected outburst to never forgetting to show me how much u really cared. i love you girl and i kno that you'll always be there for me no matter what!

*Brittanie...we got really close during school and than we stopped talking for awhile than we became real good friends again..with you its like a constant roller coaster coz i never kno when your goin to call me unexpectidly! lol you always knew just when to...right when i was about to leave the house or right when i just walked in the door from school i swear u have a 6th scence lol
I hope u get far on ur music! i love u girl!

*Ashley..You've been my best friend since the first day i walked into the science room in 8th grade. we started off really rocky but we ended up the best!  we had our times where we would fight or someone would spread a rumor about u or me but we always made it out together! I love how u also keep up with me..by trying things out with me...even if u knew we could get in trouble for it..you backed me up and were always there when i had a new jackass stunt that i wanted to try!  I still think we're gonna be the first two girls on that show babe! lol
thank your sister for me! or i can actually..lol she was always ready to get the  video camera ready to tape our stunts! lol..most of my ideas were stupid but you never turned em down!  I love that your always willing to try new things out with me! i changed u..yes i did and u remind me everytime i see u..but it was for the good! lol...and even tho we go to 2 different schools i will always be there for u..and i kno u'll do the same! love you knoxville~!

*Michael..wow cuz look i wrote u on here! lol i love you kid..you've changed since the last time i saw u..u look the same..ur just cockier! lol but hey thats u..and i love that u have the confidence in urself were no matter what any1 says it doesnt get u down! keep that forever because not alot of ppl are like that!
...lol i will always be stronger than u! lol no matter how much u bench! i love the relationship we have! you were never a cousin to me..i've always considered u my brother and u are! i wish we could go back to when it was u me preston my mom and urs.  that had to be the best time we've ever had! I love how i can tell u anything..and how even when i dont tell u something u already kno and no1 tells u! lol...i love how u and me are soo competitive..it pushes us to do our best at everything..always trying to show each other up!
i love u bro.

*Brett...lol it was good seeing u again! lol you havent changed much lol ur taller of course and ur hairs alot longer than it was 4 yrs ago..((whos isnt tho))
we've always been freinds and always will be..u were my first kiss..there i said it! you wont let me live that down either!..but hey how else was i gonna get my shoes back! lol luv u kid.

*Rodney..Wowwy boy did u get cute! lol i never thought i'd say that. haha i'm glad that u havent stopped liking me! but its a lil late now that i live in nc huh? thats alright u'll always be mah lil buddy.  I loved hearing ur made up rap songs..man they sucked big time when u first started out but u definetly improved! haha i missed u kid! love u babe.

* Renee'...i love you!!! your like my mom! i can tell u everything and anything. you advise ""never get married..never have kids"" obviously back fired on u! haha..i love you...i'm glad that ur willing to let me try out things i wouldnt be allowed to try out if i was at home with my mom! lol you've gotta be one of the coolest ppl i kno...and u didnt do anything but let me in for ice cream! lol
Never change i swear your a 15 year old trapped in a 32 year olds body! your daughter doesnt understand how good she has it! ;)

* Lee...COME BACK!! WE MISS YOU IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD! YOU TO COOL KID! YOU WERE SOO QUIET AT FIRST BUT NOW U KNO THAT U CAN JUST BE YOURSELF AND WE'LL EXCEPT U NO MATTER! ;) I LOVE YOU GIRL! 

well those are the only ppl that popped into my head and i have to go cause i stayed on much longer than i thought i would! and if i didnt say nething about u its not that i dont love you its just ur name didnt pop in my head while i was doin this! but i love you!
*mwah* <3 ande

i found this song and its for my friends dad...i changed a few of the words

Giving it all away

Hey you livin fr tomorrow
You sell your dreams for a pocket of change
Hey you smoking you sorrow
Just pointing fingers at someone to blame
Hey you, you turned your back on your children
It's left you in that big burning bed
This lifes like livin in the gutter
All this pain jsut makes you feel dead
((ch))
Your just givin it all
givin it all away
You're just givin it all
givin it all away

slow sown and just look a little closer
you might find that its not the end
you wonder how your life could get better
when you alone you just tear yourself down

((chorus))x4

Try and find your better half now
Open your eyes and find yourself
Hey you screamin for attention
Once you get it you throw it away
your broken 
they're picking up the pieces
they wont live in all your mistakes

((chorus))x4"

my song...its called:

 *What can you do?

((v1))
I like it black
You want it white
we disagree 
we have a fight
You turn to leave
and i call your name
but like everytime
that i do
its always the same

You try to avoid me 
but im always around
You want to ignore me 
but with every sound
Your laughin at me
You cant help yourself
What can you do?

((ch)): 
You pick me up
Put me back on my feet 
You push me down
How do i defeat
these ups and downs
your turn-arounds
what am i to do?
because i still want you

((v2))
You came to me
With some made-up excuse
how you wanna break-up
what we do
no use
You walk away
I dont have much to say
You've made up your mind
there's just no way

But i keep it up
i wont let it go
you'll be back soon
and this i know

((chorus x1))

because these feelings 
we try to hide inside
is showing everyone
that no matter 
how hard we may try
to stay apart
deep inside
there will always be a
you and me..yeah

I like it black
You want it white
we disagree 
we have a fight
What can you do?"

Willing and able

Would you come
WOuld you run
Would you bring it back around
Oh, baby how

If it all went away 
Nothin' left to say
Would you fight it or would you lay down
At the hand of your God could you see the light
Ah my prince can't you see what's been found

Willing and able to run
willing and able to come
I am willing, I'm willing

Willing and able to run

"event","<P>Yesterday me and monica got into a convorsation about fights..i told her that it seemed latley we'd all been fighting and i was kinda worried. She said that we all fought like brothers-sister kinda fight..which is true. Mainly because we're always with each other which is also true..most of the time. We get on each other about things as if we really were brothers and sisters. But i've been thinking..what if one of the fights doesnt end up being like a brotherly-sister kind of fight...what if we all start to separate and start to hate each other..and leave each other out of things. What if we have to start choosing who it is that we're gonna hang out with and when b.c. one of the ppl doesnt like the other. This isnt happening now and i hope that it never happens..but what are we gonna do if it does..what would you do? Fighting gets out of hand..especially if you dont kno how to stop. Honestly i dont think fighting gets you anywere and it sertainly doesnt gain you any respect..well atleast the kind of respect your wanting.</P>
<P>Arguing is kind of a mean way of gettin what you want or gettin your point across..either way it can help..sorta. Sometimes it can be pushed rigth back into your face ya kno?!</P>
<P>So tell&nbsp; me what you think about fighting..in your own opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Fighting...good or bad...</P>"

"event","Today Jordan, Monica, Anthony, and I all got into a conversation about kids. About what we would do if we had given birth to a mental/retarded child or a deformed baby. 

I would never have an abortion, in my opinion its like murder. Anthonys right about having the child live through all that, but really they wouldnt kno any better and i would rather give someone a chance to live and be the best that he/she is able to be. Instead of giving up so quickly because i was scared of it, or couldnt bear to look at it.
If my baby came out deformed I would still love him/her like I would with any other baby that I might have had. There's no reason to treat that child diffrently just because it came out with a problem or two. 

Giving the baby up for adoption i guess could work..but whats your real reason for giving the baby up? and wouldnt u wonder after a couple of years what the baby will grow up to look like..or what the baby may grow up to be...i'd rather watch my child grow before putting my responsability into someone elses hands.

Tell me what you think about this."

...Everytime...
Notice me 
Take my hand 
Why are we 
Strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me? 

Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby 

I make believe 
That you are here 
It's the only way 
I see clear 
What have I done 
You seem to move on easy 

Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
Everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song is my sorry 

At night I pray 
That soon your face 
Will fade away 

Everytime I try to fly 
I fall without my wings 
I feel so small 
I guess I need you baby 
And everytime I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you baby"

i was like ummm...i think he's gettin contacts sum time soon..i think he looks the same with em on & off..i was like i guess u'll have to judge wether he looks better on or off.  so we throw our bags down and are gettin ready to head down to the bathroom so i can see anthony and she can go to the bathroom. soo as soon as i get down the hall...i poke mah head in anthonys classroom and i'm like MATT MIGHT HAVE A GIRLFIREND!!! so anthony and pamela come runnin out and anthonys like no way! who? and i turn around and heathers standin ther..i'm like her!

i was afraid that he wsa gonna say sumfin stupid! lol
i think i may have made the perfect match..b.c. 
she was tellin me how she laughs at corny jokes that no1 else thinks is funny and i told her that it was perfect because matt tells corny, perverted, and stupid jokes that she may find funny! lol

"event","wow this week really sux! it all went down hill starting monday mornin' when mah boyfriend didn't come to mah class to say hey..b.c i hadn't talked to him n awhile since he just started his new job and he's been workin! soo yea right after mah english class i see him at his bff locker..which is usual and is where i kinda excpected he'd be...soo i go ova and give him a bigg hug coz i haven't seen him n 4eva!! sooo i give him the note i wrote him and me him and his bff walk to lunch..well he pulled out a note..and kinda hesitated to give it to me! so i finally got the note and he said he'd see me in a lil bit coz he wanted to go and eat wif his friends liek he normally does! sooo...i look at the note..and i kinda get this wierd feelin in the pit of mah stomache! and wow was i NOT ready for what was about to come!
I open up the note and the first thing he puts is ..""we need to talk"" the must dreaded words ever! and i just knew the time had come! so i read on and he talked about how he only wanted to be friends and how he was gonna be turnin 17 in a month and how i'm only 14 and how his rents bug him about..and i can understand the whole age difference thingy coz i mean i dont' kno so i read on and he was talkin about the friends thingy coz before we went out we were best friends and he told me everything! but than when we decided to go out the whole sharing secrets with each other stopped! i mean i felt it to and i wanted to say something but i didnt' want to risk loosing him b.c i've liked him 4 quite awhile and i guess i got kinda selfish but yea i read it all and than i walked right into the bathroom since it was right there and i went to the handycap..(spellcheck lol) stall and i bent down in the corner and just cried..normally i don't cry ova dudes coz i thing that guys are not worth crying ova but i did and it wasn't one of those lil whimmpy cries it was one of those ""snort, trying to catch ur breath"" kinda cry and ppl either got  real quiet or they started talkin louder..and sum chick came up to the stall and was like hey are u okay and i was just like ""SNORT"" lol from breathing in so heavy..i got out after everyone left and checked mah eyes..coz he said he wanted to talk afterwords and i didn't wanna look liek i was cryin! but mah eyes were bloodshot red! and i mean red! so i went out found one of my bffs and dragged her into the bathroom with her pizza and all! at first she was pullin back b.c she didn't wanna go in the bathroom wif food! lol but i wouldn't let her go we finally got in and mah waterworks turned right back on! and this time i couldnt' stop cryin..so after like 5 min..we went out and we talked about our upcommin lacrosse game and he walked by and i just wanted to cry again but i stopped it and mah girl ash left so me and him could talk..we talked about it..and mah voice got kinda shaky..he wanted to take me home after school so we could talk so i kinda started lookin around coz i could feel mah tears commin and than he was liek  ahh don't cry ..i'm liek i'm not! lol good thing i didnt but the whole time he kept huggin me..it was really wierd! but yea enuff of that...he did take me home and we had a really nice talk! it was good..i still liek him alot! and i think the fact that i dont' have and prolly won't eva get him back is what makes me want him more! grr! lol but yea..than i found out that he was flirtin liek crzy the next few days and taht really set me off! lol..but yea today we lost our game! grr..but 50 hundred! but oh well..better luck next time right! well i really have to go now!! luv ya sorry about all the drama!

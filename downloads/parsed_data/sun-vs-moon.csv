"event","Well the weekend was crazy i guess. Friday I went with Nicole to the skyroom for 5acrosstheeyes' cd release show. It was pretty decent. I like going to shows they make me smile. I was just gunna stay home and watch movies with adam but then we ended up leaving with nicole. And then she dropped us off back at adam's so she could see her friend jamie. So me and adam watched around the fire. That is such a sweet movie. Well i like it anyway. Later that night we went and picked up Mandi from work and adam hardcore danced in subway, its the funniest shit in the world to watch. Well after picking mandi up we went to meijers and i had to chase her down the hallway to sing happy birthday to her cause i think she was embarressed. O well. She also bought me this bling belt with a k on it. Its sweet but i dunno why she did it. Thank you mandi. After that we picked melvin up and went to the Texan (always a nice place). I saw josh miller there, it was crazy, I havn't seen that kid in years. Well after the Texan we drove around and listened to music and got lost. Nicole tryed to say she knew exactly where we were but i knew we were lost. After we were done driving around she dropped me and adam back off at home and we ended up watching the first evil dead. Sunday ma and adam went to mitch's to mess around it was fun we just kept switching instruments around the 4 of us (gonzo,mitch,adam,me) who were down there. But i have also relized I don't care for mitch much. He has to play what he wants or its not good enough and then he wants to drown everyone out and it just makes him look like an ass. I mean he is a great guitar player he just has a really shitty attitude. And then He stole weed from his uncle and he he sold me this like half a bowl for like 2 dollars I thought it was gay but hey what can ya do. I guess the moral of my story is I think mitch is gay. And on other notes this will prolly be the last entry I do."

I was pulled into the hardcore dancing circle and got clocked in the back of the head and then I was get tackled from like every angle. I had fun though. Afterward I went to the Texan with Nicole and Mandi and Adam, saw alot of people there it was nuts. Also got to eat some fried mushrooms those things are so good. I recommend eating some right away. I was supposed to stop by Brandy's but she fell asleep so that was cancelled. Wow the screen is doing this really wierd line moving down the screen thing and it makes me think im becoming brain washed. I dunno anymore about anything. I think I am a manic-depressant, because Im always getting really down for no reason. Thoughts flow through my brain for no reason and then I don't wanna be around anyone I don't want to do anything I just wanna become anti-social and then later i'll be fine but I guess I'm never truly fine.

Well I ended up staying the night amd the next morning we ate this rice and salsa stuff it was crazy and tasted like bland spice. I dunno. Then me and Kufta and Gezus go to the mall and I see Nicole there ad Im talking about how I wanted to get a girl's number in hottopic so nicole was like ill get it i was like go for it. I didn't think she was actually gunna do it but she did. And I was shot down. haha but its ok i thought it was funny and at least she said i was very cute. But it could all be a ploy so i don't feel bad. And then I ended up going and seeing Big Fish with Nicole and Mandi and Adam. Adam and Mandi didn't like it. But I did and I believe Nicole did too.

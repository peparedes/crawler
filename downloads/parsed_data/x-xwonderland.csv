"event","i took the test today. i went to boots and done it in the metrocenter toilets. it came back negative. 
but, for some reason i just cant shake the feeling. either that or, i dont want to shake the feeling. 
i really dont know what i want right now. im 16 and im finding myself actually wanting a baby. 
i was so scared and upset when i thought i could be, now i know im not i think what i really wanted was to be.

the test confused me and the line was really faint so i have no idea what that means. i should have gotten the digital one because that just blaitently says 'pregnant' 'not pregnant'
i might go and get one of those tomorrow. i dont think i want to believe that im getting this fat on my own. i wanna have a reason in my life. a reason to stop dossing about and being a tit. i want a reason in my life. and that seemed like it was. 

i dont know what to think. all the signs say i am but the results say im not. i feel like im living for nothing. i dont think this would make sense to anyone apar from someone who feels the same way."

"event","what do i do?
everything matches up.
shit.
but its not my fucking fault, i'm doing everything i can be doing.
it's not all up to me, you know, he can do things aswell, i even told him its not 110%
shitting fucking dick fuck cunt bitch.
shit.
im such a fucking idiot. oh for fucks sake. all i can fucking do is swear.
shitting fucking fuck. 
i'd rather be anywhere but here right now.
i keep just getting the shivers for no fucking reason. im shitting my self, quite frankly. 
i have to concentrate on somthing, so this is it.
today i woke up really late, at ab out half past two, that was because my brother made a loud noise and shouted fuck. i gave a groan and turned the lamp on, checked the time and was like 'wtf?' i sat up and put a couple of pillows behind me and sparked up a ciggy. i smoked that whilst listening to some music.
i got up and my brother asked me where saw was, he rented it and let me watch it last night, i told him it was in theps2.
i walked into the living room and turned the laptop on i put a jacket potato on and hand washed my white trakkie bottems and put them in the tumble dryer.
i checked my myspace and ate my jacket tatie with beens and cheese, i went in the shower and washed my hair, when i got out i put my underware on and put some music on, i tied my hair up and dried my fringe, i done my makeup and put my pants on. then my mum rang me and i spoke to her, i sent louis a text saying i was going to his. i got the quarter to four bus from mine, i had to run for it.
i rang danielle when i was on the bus, then i was at the metro and had another ciggy. then i felt really sick and got a bottle of coke. i was about to get on the 44 when louis said him and james where coming into the metro, i pussyed about trying dresses on in jane norman until they got there.
when they did we saw lucy, i gave her a tab.
then we got on the 47 and went to james'
then we saw brian on his digger and he looks much better than he did last time i saw him. he's still an arsehole and a nonse though. ally has james' phone. then we saw mark, im seeing him tomorrow at bellys house.
then we went in james' and watched come dine with me whilst he ate his tea.
then we went out. it was cold.
we came back in and played monoply for two and a half hours. i came 2nd. louis lost and james won.
we had a natter then walked to the bus stop, james gave me my ipod backl.
we waited with louisn for the bus then went to my bus stop.
i got on the bus and came home.
i have my dog back, i bet my mum misses him, i feel really sorry for her, shes all alone now.
she can have my baby when i have it.
the dog made a right fuss when i came in and i made a fuss of him. i talked to my stepdad and came on the laptop.

that was my day and i dont feel any better."

"event","me and you are perfect for eachother.

blatently so perfect that you can walk away from me and i wont care. so perfect that you can just ditch me for other girls when we're out. so perfect for eachother that you dont have to make an effort and i wont mind.
is that what you think?
well, you're wrong. i have a brain, lik you. i have eyes, like you. i have feelings, like you. i have a heart, like you.
i dont wanna just be thrown to the side when you feel like it. just cos i love you it doesn't mean i love everything you do. and i wanna have real conversations with you. like about us. about me and about you. cos tbh, how much do we really know about eachother?
sometimes, im sitting with you and my friends and i think 'my god. how many of these has he been with?'
and it's usually the majority, this is the longest you've ever been in a ralationship. this is yourfirst relationship over two week.
when i ask you why you dont pay any attention to me anymore you tell me you love me.
i could sit here all night and swear im a boy, but you wouldn't believe me.
anyone can say anything, but to be believed you need proof.
i dont wanna loose you.
i love you, but im not a fucking idiot."

at south sheilds. in july. with tasha and danielle standing by, watching.
i wish i could actually tell someone this. say it outloud. but, every one will be like 'it was so long ago, you two havn't spoke in weeks. forget him'
<i>well, we havn't spoke in days. no infact it's been a matter of weeks. so the next time that you need me dont expect to call.</i>

the great thing is he actually knows what he did to me. he knows how me hurt me. useeeed. cheap replacement for when camilla was in america. the first kiss was dead perfect.
like, i'd always imagained a perfect couples kiss to be.
we where sitting in a feild, on a sunny day. all with flowers. looken up at him, looked down. he lifted my chin up and kissed me. i pure snuggled in to him and he goes 'your perfect' and i went 'nar love, i'm not' and he goes, 'to me you are'. and it was dead lush. 
but when we went beach it was dead lovely. everything we done together was dead lovely. 
the only time i didn't wanna be near him was at that gig, 'me and camilla are back together. i love you.'
he spent half the night hugging me from behind, kissing my neck, and asking me what was wrong.
he spent the other half on stage talking about 'the most beautiful girl in the world' who's he'd won back that night, despite no one special trying to break them up.

he made me feel like i was worth somthing when i was with him :) like i could actually do somthing in my life. like i deserved it all. 
'Today was too weird. last time i woke up i was on a tropical rock, now im a thousand miles away, kissing my best friend.'

i fell in love at the seaside."

"event","<small>So, right what happend was Lauren went to her dads and me and luis stayed at hers for a bit, we tided up, danced, got locked in the celler. Had wine. Tried to do somthing with my hair (?)looked for some sort of make-up I had at home but not with me (Can't remember what it was) (eyeliner?)
Then Lauren rang, and then we went to lydias, then i had unbrellas in my hair, then we hid the wine in luis' hoodie, and then we drank some more.
And then, walking up Lydias road, i got all upset about leaving and started to cry. Then Luis made me feel better.
I liked Max's skirt. It's yellow. I flicked it.
I gave someone the red wine that Lydia had given me because i diddn't want to get drunk (Wtf?)
Then I was crying again, and I was with Patrick, Janek and some others. And then Hannah and Anna where here.
Then. I was lying on the bed talking at luis. (Yes, he wasn't talking bak to me. Wonder why..HA)and then i was crying, was luis there? I can't remember. And it was all shit.
And then Lauren rang and said she couldn't come back because of somthing. And then I think I upset here..
And then I was on a sofa. And then i was in a bed.
I'M KOOL.

I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you

and the reason is you 
and the reason is you
and the reason is you

I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I've found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you"

Klaire likes to dance<br> 
Strange I'm still happy? a BIT. But you cant take my MEMEORIES. You can take my life, you can take my heart, you can take my lover, BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE MY MEMORIES.<br>
I like memories. Sometimes they make me happy, sometimes they make me sad. Like everything in life<br>
BUT at the moment they're happy. Happy things make Klaire happy. Well, of corse.<br>
I diddn't like Luis' message. ""Because of Lauren."" that made me sad.<br>
Because of Lauren? BECAUSE of Lauren?<br>
But i'm confused. But if I knew WHAT happend/is happening i guess I wouldn't be confused.<br>
But I'm a confuser. I confuse myself. <br>
Is confuser a word?<br>
I can't get jack to put dr. finkelstein's brain in. It's hard<br>
Yeah I play the nightmare before christmas on the playstation. PROBLEM?<br>
WHAT?! .Prescribed pills. says:<br>
klaire ignore that message<br>
Can people stop confusing me?! So. It was all about Lauren. All of it. It will all be about Lauren.<br>
We diddn't because of Lauren.<br>
We did because we wanted to<br>
We stopped because of Lauren <br>
Now we can because of lauren. <br>
I'm not..you know, saying no to ignoring it, i'm just confused.<br>
Somtimes I wonder what's built on whta, if that makes sence. My family, what are we built on? Lies? Love? Conversations? Hate? I don't know.<br>
What are friendships built on? LIES. <br>
I lie. I am a lie. I'm built on lies. <br>
*Ignore*<br>
That's a memorie.<br>
I lost. Cheese. Egg. Penguin. Pineapple. ""It was a graveyard smash"". <br>
Some memories just cant sop comming through. And I don't mind that. Those memories, i'll never forget them. Good times. With good people. I don't know what going to happen. I'm going to leave, and things will just, fall apart I guess.<br>
I'm not going to stop cmming to London. I have people here I want to see. Jess, Charlotte, Luis (?), Jamie..just..I have people to see. I'm not going to stop comming down here because of that.<br>
Just like TB. Nothing has stopped him, has it? Maybe it's not my place to bring him up. I don't know. <br>
I do have some things to tie up in the next moth. I can't leave things like this. No way. It would kill me for the rest of my life.<br>
I don't know.<br>
Nothing should stop me doing anything, and I don't think it is going to stop me. any of it.<br>
I guess alot of it's my falt, but I don't see where I went wrong. The lies, that's right. The lie. Me. I was the lie, i am the lie.<br>
I hae a feeling this year i gonna be a good one..<br>
But then again, what do i know? Not alot, yeah?<br>
I love you. I fucking LOVE you.."

The Angel From My nightmare.

Go back to last night. Please let it be like that for ever. I want it to be like last night. Forever and ever.
You know, never changing.
For ever, please.
But, it wont will it.
""We move on, and on.
And forget about the times we used to have.
We're movin' on and on and on and on.""
I don't want things to change, between any of us.
I want to change it.
But I can't. Why? 
Because I'm a little girl.
Little girls can't change big things.
""Nobody said it was easy..""

But last night was just, amazing.
when I read that, my heart stopped.
Or skipped a beat.
One of the two.
And I couldn't get over it.
I want to feel like that forever.
I want to love you forever.
i want you to love me forever.

But then, I guess that would never happen.
Last night, you where upset.
You don't mean some things when you're upset, do you?
It happens to the best of us, babe.
Yeah, it does.
And I don't blame you.

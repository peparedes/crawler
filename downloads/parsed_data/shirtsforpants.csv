"event","Time Fence (my band of the last couple years) will be playing two rad DIY shows in southern-maine this coming weekend, on friday the 26th and saturday the 27th. due to certain complicating geographical circumstances that have arisen, this could end up being the last team Fence shows for a long time. we are hoping that we will not have to end the band permanantly, but things are somewhat hanging in the balance at the moment. i figured i'd try to get the word out now, since there is a chance you the reader will never get to see us play again and most of you have probably never even seen us despite being a band in various degrees of functionality for quite a long time now.

we've put long hours (see also: years) and ridiculous levels of effort into getting our jams to their current states, so come hang and we'll lay that shit down as best we can. while i'm usually champion of stupid levels of modesty when it comes to art i'm creatively involved with, i'm taking this opportunity to say that Time Fence really is worth seeing. like, we are rad. we are doing some unique stuff with these sounds we've got all twisted up. shittier bands have most definitely existed (i've been in a couple of them, even). we are also most likely in no way the worst band in north america to have lyrically delved into complex themes of self-discovery within the children's movie Rookie of the Year.

the first show from a potentially badical new DIY collective based out of UMass, and it's free! team Fence will be playing a new jam: our prog-bent psuedo-cover of Love's 1969 psyche-rock jam ""august,"" which will either rule endlessly or be an entertaining mess.

unfortunately, The Ear the Eye and the Arm has dropped off due to the lame news of them not being a band anymore. it'll still be a fun show, though, with the also rad Propagandhi-style pop-punk of Gift Horse taking their place.

"event","hey. i write film criticism/reviews fairly regularly, and they just sort of sit around on my computer. i figured i'd post it on the internerd this time...

<img src=""http://correctopinion.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/pineapple-express.jpg"">

While there are plenty of enjoyable moments in Pineapple Express, it is most consistent in, well... its inconsistencies. It seems clear that this bumpy ride is the product of a confused piece of screen writing. This is no secret, but to understand why this has happened one has to realize that these same handicaps show their faces in the Judd Apatow crew's most defining and celebrated movies. 

Yes, most of the improv-heavy movies by Apatow and his like-minded collaborators all have some of these same weird screen writing issues with pacing and story (we're talking Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and Superbad). They sometimes feel oddly structured and very amateur in their frequent avoidance of the screen writing 101 trope of ""upping the stakes."" Chances to heighten the urgency of story-driving plot points are frequently side-stepped, dampening the forward motion of the film and making the audience wonder what they're supposed to be caring about in the long run.

Now, why has this not been such a problem until this movie? Sometimes those decisions make Apatow and company's films feels fresh, realistic, unpredictable, and interesting. Since a comedy's main goal is to be funny and develop the characters rather than plot, it's easier to get away with less satisfying resolutions and story pacing. With Pineapple Express, we no longer have a straight-up comedy on our hands, and the genre deviation is what really hurts this one. 

In making the film an action-comedy hybrid, these guys should have realized that their typical decisions would feel more sloppy than quirky when applied outside their favored genre. Unlike with Hot Fuzz (a movie which has been oddly compared to Pineapple Express when it really begs contrasting), the script here is loose and underwritten. The action lacks the parody factor that held Hot Fuzz together and is often awkwardly inserted into scenes, feeling out-of-place amidst the improvisational comedy bits, many of which simply weren't that funny when compared to this crew's past output.

If the jokes had been more consistent and frequent, maybe all the other inconsistencies would have been easier to let slide, but the decision to try to make the action-adventure plot such a strong focus and then construct it so poorly made for a film difficult to digest."

"event","i learned tonight that prodigal polish death-metal youngsters Decapitated were in an automobile accident a few days ago while on tour in Russia. their bus smashed into some big truck hauling wood, and their drummer and singer both got pretty fucked up. 

well, their drummer has since died. not only was the dude only 23 (as he started with Decapitated at age 14 or something equally ridiculous), this is a pretty terrible loss for the future of death-metal in general. not exactly your run-of-the-mill band, nor weathered veterans past their prime. furthermore, the drummer was brother to one of the guitarists, which makes me wonder if the band is now done for good. i know i would have a pretty fucking hard time keeping it going in the face of that kind of tragedy. bandmates are often practically family as it is, and i imagine being in a band with your brother would kindle a pretty amazing and close relationship.

more than just the time i stupidly passed up a chance to see the band play, i feel bad about now never being able to see the drummer this dude could have matured into, considering the more than impressive skills he employed to help give the death-metal scene a needed kick in the balls with Decapitated's debut record ""Winds of Creation"" back in 2000 when he was a mere 16 years old.

anyone who has any appreciation in death-metal should check out Decapitated's records. go find ""Winds of Creation"" and rock the shit out of it. fucking great record that blew apart any notions that they were running on the novelty of their ridiculously young age. it's even got a killer Slayer cover for a closer that sounds even better than Slayer's version.

""Time Fence with Ed Targonski,"" the greatest post-hardcore demo-recording ever inspired by ""the number-one polka TV show on television,"" is all packaged up and ready to be listened to. that's 5 exciting songs for just 3 significantly-more-boring american dollars!

get in touch with any one of us or catch VA's Barkitecture on their east-coast tour this summer to grab a copy. don't wait for the next Time Fence show to pick one up, because we won't have a chance to play again for a long-ass time unless some little summer tour magically organizes itself.

mp3s from the demo are up for download at <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/timefence"">myspace.com/timefence</a>, so check 'em out if you haven't already. also, if anyone from maine wants one of these, they should get in touch mega soon (...like by yesterday) if they want to avoid paying a buck or whatever for shiping, as i'm moving to northampton this friday (tomorrow).

"event","hello patrons of the internerd,

due to my computer and various harddrives exploding recently and my not having the internet for the entire summer, i've been upable to update the OS!R site in a long fucking time or otherwise make use of the internets. on top of those difficulties, i am trying to straighten out my last year at school and attempting to write the screenplay to the film i'm going to be making. i'm also playing in two new bands, one in maine and (finally) one in amherst... so yeah, a lot of shit. some sweet shit, though.

but, to get to the point, i haven't completely forgotten about all the pending releases for OS!R. the biggest news right now is the completion of ""this is the moment,"" the mammoth of a music documentary & decked out DVD set i've been working on for the past couple years. i had planned to release the DVD over the summer, but after getting set back due to technical crap, i decided to tighten the film even further and add some footage to the bonus disc that was shot over the summer. 
 
as of an hour ago, i have in my posession master copies of both discs (the movie on the first, and a collection of featurettes and radical live dealies on the second). this is very very good news, and not only for people who give two shits about any one of the bands represented on this beast. with the bastardly project out of the way i can finally attempt to have a social life again! That is, until i have to edit my horror film... damn. anway, i still have to be order packaging supplies and finalize the art, but the discs are done, and, not only do they look sick, they're totally stacked full extra gems and live performances that didn't fit into the movie itself.

so, a thanksgiving release? well, it'll be out as soon as possible at least, so if anyone even reads this thing and wants to make sure they get a copy, just e-mail me at ohsnaprecords AT yahoo.com or leave a message. oh, and the final product will probably run somewhere around 10 to 12 bucks a pop, depending on how expensive all the packaging and all that is.

shit's tight, so look out for it and tell all yer buddies.

"event","so i saw some kids taping xBurning Flagx's set at the tom hammill show the other night... 

since i never had any video footage of them to include on the bonus DVD for the oh snap! movie, i was hoping i could get them tapes off whoever was taping it. eh? that'd be pretty sick and would at least give some sort of benefit to all the set-backs the DVD has gotten...

totally get in touch with me. i leave for school in a week and a half and will promptly be finishing the DVD.

also, if anyone has any last comments or ideas about the DVD, let me know now, as i won't be wasting anytime getting those dealies burned, packaged, and printed."

"event","i've hit a few snags with upcoming releases as one might have expected (primarily with the DVD, due to a lack of a computer to author and burn the final discs). i also am without internet for the summer, so ohsnaprecords.com has gone un-updated for quite some time, despite some significant news. so here's the deal...

+ first off, <b>nearly all currently in-press releases on OS!R are now available at Strange Maine in portland, maine</b> -- the sickest punk-run record/cd/movies/books/videogames/rad-shit-priced-ridiculously-cheap store i've ever known. also, along with all the other local cds, my releases aren't marked up a penny more than they are when i sell them at a show or online. the dude who runs the store is a great kid, so be sure to check out the store whether or not you give a shit about OS!R to help keep that place going! it's located on congress st. between MECA and the portland museum of art.

+ copies of the <b>Midriff</b> full-length cd ""Session"" are finally in my posession! these boys dropped a grand and a half on recording and mastering this hour-long beast of a debut record. melding genres like no other, Midriff creates some unique sounds that seem to leave a real impression, while still keeping themselves far away from anything overly-serious or pretentious (much like the kids in the band themselves who were always quick to make a joke out of themselves).

+ the new <b>Falls of Rauros</b> cd ""Into the Archaic"" is way sick, and i've got a couple copies left in the distro. the thing's 60 minutes long and well fucking worth the $3 they're asking a piece. do yourself a favor and pick that thing up -- ""northern appalachian folk black metal.""

+ <b>Fort ved Brann</b> demo-cdeps are still kicking around for 3 bucks a pop, but if you want to get your hands on one of the mega insane hand-screened hollowed-out bible mini-cd versions, get in touch with me. only twenty were made, since they took a full year to make, and they go for like twenty bucks. it's a bit more than i wanted to charge for them, but considering how like a billion hours of my life was sacrificed to getting them finished (along with a bit of $$$), i'd say it's more than a fair price.

+ and lastly, Shawn and I have a new two-piece project. and don't worry, it's not just a Nicholouse Ferrante reprise. we just played our first show, and we need a name, so try to come up with one.

"event","so... the DVD set for the oh snap! movie ""This Is The Moment"" is on hold right now.

in case you have not yet heard, my harddrives were locked in the basement of the media center where I was working on the movie and DVD. i managed to get them back, but I had to return to Maine and was unable to burn the master discs. nearly everything is complete: the final cut of the movie, the finalized bonus features, and the DVD menus. so... 

IF ANYONE HAS A GOOD MAC COMPUTER THAT COULD RUN THE PROGRAMS ""FINAL CUT"" AND/OR ""DVD STUDIO PRO,"" PLEASE GET IN TOUCH WITH ME! some videos need to be encoded to mpeg2 (DVD format) and some menu work need to be done. it's very minor, end-of-the-line work, but if no one has a computer on which I can do this, i will have to wait until next fall when i am again allowed access to the media center in amherst where i clocked the rest of the 8 million hours i spent working on this monster of a project.

thank you,

i made a few tests versions of this FVB shirts last summer, and a few people who have seen them have been bugging me to do a run. brown ink on a black shirt ended up looking especially awesome, so that's likely what i will do for the main run.

basically, the situation is this: i am neck deep in releases right now on the label, and my wallet is going to get hit pretty fucking hard in the coming months. so if i go through with making these shirts, i'm going to need to know just how many people want them and in what sizes. the shirts will be black, but i could do a custom color print on them for anyone who preorders as long as i have that color ink. brown on black really does look awesome, though.

shirts will probably be $6 a pop and will be slick as hell. they will make you really cool and allow you to swoon that special someone you've been eyeing.

so yeah, WHO WANTS ONE???"

"event","yeah, i'm stuck at school for another week working on this monster of a music documentary movie thingy i started making over a year ago. i've clocked like 8 billion hours on this thing, and i think as of tonight i finally have a finalish cut of the feature. i've only managed to cut it down to an hour and 45min, though, and 90min is the top length i can do without having to either shell out for fancy dual-layer DVDRs or make everything overly-shitty quality. ayeeee, and once i finish this i have to do like half a billion hours worth of DVD work, as i haven't designed any menus or finalized anything for the totally ripped bonus disc.

i need an assistant so bad. someone come out to amherst and be my slave, or at least bring me some Grasshopper... or any sort of vegan food that will fit down my throat. i haven't eaten anything all day save a little microwave burrito i had when i woke up. 

aye, four more days of this is going to murder me. but at least this shit is finally almost done with... and pretty much kicks ass (but i'm sure you already knew that much).


also, i miss ashley a lot. i had some weird dream last night that i'm not really remembering now, but she was in it. i think she was naked and chilling on the sidewalk or something while people walked bye all ""sup?"" it was supposed to be in denmark or somewhere in the UK where people are naked in public all the time. i pretty much forget the entire rest of the dream, but just pretend hanging out with her for a bit was pretty awesome. plus, she was naked, which is always a bonus. it's going to rule living with her and huber this summer."

the mammoth of a production that has been the big OS!R punkumentary movie is FINALY nearing completion... but i still don't have a title for it!
someone come up with a rad name for it, and i'll reward you with a nice, virtual pat on the back.

in case you're unfamilar with the project, the movie has been in the works for quite some time now and is an attempt to document a small, pocket DIY music scene in southern-maine that had flourished for the past three or four years. it also includes live performances and antics from Midriff, Everysmithever, Fort Ved Brann, Departure From Apathy, Tom Hamill, the Noodle Strainer Disease, Shirts For Pants, and more.
if anyone else had any video footage to submit to the DVD, LET ME KNOW NOW! in just a couple weeks this will need to be 100% finished!


the next month or two is going to be huge for OS!R releases after quite a lull in productivity. Quite a few major projects that have been culminating for YEARS are finally on the horizon:

<b>1.</b>  the OS!R retrospective DVD will finally be released by the end of June!
<b>2.</b>  the ridiculously fancy, ultra-limited, black-metal-ed out version of the <a href=""http://www.ohsnaprecords.com/fortvedbrann"">Fort Ved Brann</a> demo-cdep is unrealistically set to come out on june 6th of the year of our lord two thousand and six -- a.k.a. the day 6/6/6!
<b>3.</b>  the also as-of-yet untitled OS!R retrospective compilation CD should be released some time in June or July (gah, help think of a name for that thing too!).
<b>4.</b>  Midriff's full-length CD ""Session"" should finally be available by the end of this month! it was completed at the end of last summer, but when the band broke up, all of the newly completed cds were reportedly shoved into storage with the band's gear. this thing should have been out long ago, so get psyched.


also, the new folk-black-metal band <a href=""http://www.ohsnaprecords.com/fallsofrauros"">Falls of Rauros</a> (ex-midriff & apagon) have a new demo out that's totally worth checking out, and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/xburningflagx"">xBurningFlagx</a> has been rocking out while taking massive shits all over american flags and ""support our troops"" magnetic yellow ribbons and have thusly pretty much toppled the fascist, american darth vader empire.

"event","ok, so spring break isn't going to be much of a break for me, but that's alright.

1. the OS!R video project for the DVD will get set into overdrive, because after this weekend, who knows if i will have a chance to be able to shoot/interview anyone else in maine before i have to have the whole thing ready for a final edit. help me out if you want that thing to see the light of day, or it simply won't happen.

2. i will be testing out mad amps and recording equipment. hopefully some rad shit in there. people should play music with me while testing all that stuff out at the new (old) house in scarborough. you can even help me bomb the basement studio to get rid of the rotting corpse smell!

3. and last but certainly not least, the overly-ambitious, way limited bible edition of the FVB demos will FINALLY be screened and on their way to the finish line! it's been a year coming, but holy shit are these going to be intense. there aren't going to be a whole lot of them, so unfortunately a lot of people aren't going to be able to get one, but i plan on pricing them so you'll probabaly just be like, ""FUCK THAT! i'll just buy one of the sick-looking $3 ones!"" since i have a whole bunch of those bad boys left.

it took a long fucking time to gather those all up, so i'm happy to say they have been recovered, along with some other parts essential to making the elaborate FVB demos a reality.

they should be completed by the end of this month, as long as fellow dudes pitch in (it takes a long fucking time to cut all the way through the good book).

i could still use some more performance footage, but i am nearing the final stages of this project, and i need to head to maine in order to conduct interviews and to take other additonal footage to be used in the piece. if you're going to be around to participate and/or help out in this, please let me know, as there is not much time left at all to do it.

"event","holy crap, i think i'm going to boston AGAIN this weekend. this will be my fourth visit in less than a month, most of which have been mere coincidences. this time i'm meeting my uncle at my dad's place saturday morning in order to drive up to maine, unload massive amounts of music equipment, drive back to boston, and drive back to amherst (preferably before some big storm takes over new england). hopefully my mom doesn't murder me when she sees exactly how big everything is and how much there is. i'm going to be putting a serious dent in that basement and will need a fair amount of sheets to protect it all from the basementy elements.

i wish i could stick around the city afterwards to either chill with some people or visit caleb and master the recordings of the live sets that may make their way to the Oh Snap! dvd or the cd compilation... but being snowed in would suck, and i'm not sure what i would do with my permit-less car in regards to parking. so yeah, the old in and out.


and on an entirely unrelated note...

HELLO THERE, CITIZEN OF THE INTERNET,

IN THE CASE THAT YOU HAVE RECENTLY FALLEN INTO A PLETHORA OF FREE MONEY AND TIME, IT WOULD BE VERY KIND OF YOU TO GET THESE RECORDS INTO MY HANDS/ONTO MY TURNTABLE. OTHERWISE, IF YOU JUST HAPPEN TO OWN ANY OF THEM AND WANT TO GET RID OF THEM IN A REASONABLE EXCHANGE OF GOOD OR SERVICES, I AM LISTENING.

Jimmie: Knock it off, Jules.

Jimmie: I don't need you to tell me how snakes on a planing good my coffee is, okay? I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is. When Bonnie goes shopping she buys SNAKES ON A PLANE. Me, I buy the gourmet expensive stuff because when I drink it I want to taste it. But you know what's on my mind right now? It AIN'T the coffee in my kitchen. It's the dead snakes on a plane in my garage!

"event","so, it appears that the server (xasm.net) that was hosting the oh snap! site and all the subsequent band sites has had to shut down.

this sucks, and i'm not sure where else to turn for hosting the site, as xasm was a ridiculously good deal ($6 a mo with 1g space and 50g bandwidth), and i can't afford to spend much at all on hosting, since the label has been pretty slow lately anyway. 

so does anyone have any suggestions for a host?"

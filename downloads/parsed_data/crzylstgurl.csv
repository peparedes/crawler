"event","wow my day pretty much just got even worse. And to think, this morning I was upset because I couldn't make my mind up if I liked this guy or not. 
So after dance, Brad picks me up and we go to get Jacob. So in the car, i was trying to compromise a way for Jacob and Ito be with our friends, and get dance, and jacobs bar mitzvah stuff out of the way, in just a few days. So i offered this one thing, and it wasnt even that bad, and he starts to blow up yelling at me. this was our arguement:
ME: So what the fuck are we supposed to do while we are at your house for 25 more days?
HIM: It's not my fault camp is over.
ME: Well if i could have, i would have gone all summer, or at least while i was with you. Camp actually isn't over, it is just for me, cuz you wont take me there. 
HIM: Im not a taxi.
ME: Well if i could drive, i would drive, if you lived closer, i would walk. honestly, its just a little bit to far to walk from here. 
HIM: I think you just lost your ride to dance next week ( Spitting while talking)
ME: EW YOU JUST SPIT ON ME!
HIM: (Purposly spit all over me)
ME: EW WHAT THE FUCK?! 
( a few seconds later)
ME: so what exactly are we supposed to do at your house.
HIM: well you have your computers, and a pool.
ME: I am so sick of the computer is not even funny, and the pool is disgusting. 
HIM: Your friends are more than welcome over here. 
ME: My friends dont like you, they hate you. 
HIM: That's not my problem
ME: well it sure as hell isn't my problem. 
HIM: its just a reflection on you, your friends must hate you then too.
ME: I AM ABSOLUTLY NOTHING LIKE YOU, IF THAT""S WHAT YOUR TRYING TO TELL ME!
(later)
ME: So what is there to do, honestly, you sit here playing computer games all day, the least you can do is try to get to know me and jacob, cuz i honestly dont know who you are, not quiet sure why im in the car with you either. 
HIM: You know me, and you never want to do anything with me. You never talk with your mom. 
ME: I am extremly close with mom. I can talk to her about anything, it's nice. 
HIM: You never want to talk to me. 
ME: You never give me the chance, and when i do tell you something, its a 'cool' or an 'oh'. i feel like im talking to a wall. 
(sitting waiting for an answer or responce)
ME: So What can i say, im about to tell you everything i think about you. You honestly dont give a shit about me or Jacob. You and me both know the only reason that you keep seeing us, is so that mom doesnt gain full costody of us. 
HIM: What huh huh no. 
ME: So why dont me and jacob just go live with mom, that way we will be out of your way, you cant use us as excuses any more, you dont have to pay for us for food or whatever, we wont eat your damn ass cereal, and we wont get in the way of you getting a full time job. We will give you time to get back on your feet and situated, before we see you again. It would give us all a nice break. 
HIM: I AM ON MY FEET!!! 
ME: 'crying' no your not, and if you are, your not setting a very good example of what ""on my feet"" means. 

Then we just bickered back and forth till we got back to his house. honestly i dont know why i wrote that whole thing out, or how i rememebred it all. but whatever, read it if you ever care, i seriously dont care. just needed to get that written out. ugh. whatever."

"event","-It seems with camp, the week goes by so much faster. but my last week of camp is slowing coming closer and closer. What shall I ever do once it is over??? I dread to live the days where day after day I'm just sitting here doing nothing. 

- So I went to the library yesterday and got a shit load of books. I was like well I have nothing better to do with my life while I'm here, I'll read. So the two of the books I grabbed that I am excited about reading are, Go ask Alice, and Heart on my sleeve. I'm already half way down with Heart on my sleeve. It's really good. It's about this guy, Julian, and girl, Chole, who meet at a pre-frosh weekend at this collage for music. They are both finishing their last highschool year, with prom and graduation. And well it's basically letters,emails, and IM's sent between Chole, and her friends, and Julian and his friends. I don't know, I found it fun to read. ha. After I finish this one, I'm going to read Go Ask Alice. That should be interesting. 

- Oh yeah so yesterday, my dad and Lisa came up to me and Jacob, and said, "" We decided we were going go to give each of you 100 dollars to buy clothes and what not with."" and I was shocked that they would acutally do that, and Lisa was like yeah but we should wait till tomarrow when all the good sales go on. so today is yesterday's tomarrow.  So, I hope we get to go shopping. real bad. lol. I'm  such a sucker. this is BRADDICK we are talking about HAAHAHAHHAHAHA! I think the chances I've given him to redeem himself are almost out. I need to work on that, not forgiving so easily. That used to be the hardest thing for me.

- Alright I'm out, gunna finish reading this book. 
much love,

"event","I'm starting to think that Brad is a victum of some, power needing disease, seriously. Dude it's crazy. I dont get that fact that we have to do every damn thing he tells us to. It's like today, he was making food, for him to eat, not me, not jacob, but for him. and he used a bazzlion dishes, so he tells me to put all the dishes away and clean up all the veggies and the counter that he used, so that i wont be late to camp. first of all, i dont have to be there till 3. and second, i walk up stairs, hes still in his fuckin shorts and hasnt changed one bit to get ready to take me, and hes playing that fucking online netropolis game, i seriously think i should go in there and just fuck him over, so that he has nothing left, and so he can't play that game any more. I dont understand why i have to clean up after him so he can play a fucking game.

UGH!

k on a more positive note, tomarrow after camp is over, im going to my moms house until 9... so gimme a call if you want to hang out okay?? mmk... So im gunna go pack and i pray to go that me and mel and steph are together tonight and not with the little kids all night....

"event","blehhhhhhhhhhh, I have no idea why the fuck I have Life of a Salesman, by Yellowcard on my ipod, no idea how the hell it even got on there. omg the lyrics disgust me... "" What's a dad for dad, tell why I'm here dad, whisper in my ear that I'm growing up to be a better man dad.......... Father I will always be that same boy that stood by the sea and watched you tower over me, now I'm older I want to be the same as you......."" ickkkkyy lyrics. fast foward to rufio. okay better. 
so how are you guys? How was your day? I hope you had a kick ass day. Mine was pretty good I would say. I got to see my mom today cuz she picked up my brother becuase he was lonely being at my dads all day with nothing to do. And on the way to get my brother, he goes,"" We're going to get your brother,"" and I was liek "" why where is he?"" and hes like "" hes a mommas boy and ran home to your mothers."" I dont know, I kind of found it funny that when we walked into his house, i checked the messages, and one of them was "" Brad? this is your mother, please call me when you get this."" I dont know but maybe hes more of the momma's boy, then Jacob. Jacob was just bored, I don't blame him. but whatever....
It's amazing, I can sit here and write for ever, and not have my cat come and drag me to go get his food, or to play with his toy rats. I can acutally just sit here and type, but it does get rather boring. I'm sure i am bugging everyone else here, singing along to a gazzillion different songs, and Im proabbly extremly off key, and god who knows, and who cares. NOT ME....
yeah okay before i bore you any more by reading this,
im out

"event","okay so today, I woke up, and knowing that we were going to watch lisa's boat race, I went back to sleep, not really excited or wanting to get up. Then from my mind reading powers, that only i have, i figured out we were leaving at 10:30, and it was 10:15, so i decided to wake up. so i changed and walked right out the door, no makeup, no warm hair straightener left on my bathroom counter, nothing. but whatever right. 

so we drove to marina del ray, 80 MPH on the freeway, and almost got killed about 3 times, seriously, but thats just how brad drives... yeah so we went to the boat, and about 30 mins into the ride out there, i got extremly sick, and everyone kept asking me if i was okay. It's like i'd be better if you would fuck off and leave me the fuck alone, i didnt even know them. it was crazy. but yeah. it sucked. 

Then we went to lisa's partyish thing after, for the trophies. and i was sitting on the floor talking to mel, and i relized that i got soooo burnt, i am sooo red. its not even funny, i have no idea how i am going to sleep tonight, and since brad just came in here and told me i have to be ready to leave for camp at 8, that means i have to get up at like fuck, 630, crazyyyyyyy. maybe ill do my hair tonight then. or not, because sitting out there listening to brad bitch about god knows what, is worse then the fucking radio stations commericials about winning trips to disneyland, that i am forced to listen to. since currently all my sorces of music have been cut off. but that's beside the point right?

eh my life seems to suck already today, whats one more bad thing right? 
here we go being negative, i sound like jacob...
how was everyone elses day? tell me something positive....
much <3

"event","Okay so, i arrived here last night, thinking, okay 39 days here, it can't be that awful right? It felt as if I was only going to stay here for a weekend or something because, normally that's the only time I am here. So, im sitting here, right next to my calender, planning out my 38 days here, and it's starting to hit me, that I'm stuck here for a pretty long time. and its not like im in summer school, or going to a camp all summer, this year. I mean I kind of wish I had something like that this summer, because it makes time with my dad go faster. But, I'm too old to be a camper at like any camps or sleepaway camps, and I'm only a C.I.T. for 6 more days and i havent decided if i really like it or not. And it kinda sucks because Im too young to get a job too. And I didn't fail any of my classes, surprisingly! so no summer school for me.
(Actually this is way off topic, but I am so proud of my grades it's not even funny. I had a B in dance, and it went to an A. and then I had a C in English and I got it to an A. and I had a D in spanish and i barley passed with a C. and I had a C in math, and then I raised it to a B. and C in science, and then i got a B. And in TCE i went from a B to an A. lol mwahahahaha lol)
ANYWAYS,
like I was saying, i really dont have anything that will keep me busy for the 39 days that i am here. So, today, bored as I will be for the next bazillion hours, i took out a calender i had, and wrote everything that i was doing. It happens that i only have like 16 days that i am acutally doing something. And because i already miss everyone very dearly, I am kinda hoping we can hang out while i am here. you know just kinda, not a lot though, just a little bit. ha ha ;)
These are the days im not doing anything, 
July- 14th, 16th, 17th, 23-29th, 
August- 6th-11th, 13th-15th, and on the 16th im going home, so I'll have a great 1/2 b-day this year, not the shit i had last year. becuase I am gunna try not to run away the day before sara comes home, ha except shes not leaving this summer, or in this case, the day i go home to my moms. ill run away a few weeks before, so that im un grounded by the time its the 16th. ha joking. i hope. lol. 
So let me know if you want to do something... I really want to go to Knott's, Six flags, or Wild Rivers or something... so let me know if you wanna go or something i dont know. 

Okay I really needed to write that down, because my calender is filled with little doodles, and drawings I do when I'm bored, and well since I am  extremly bored, you can imagine how messy it looks. 

Oh yeah, and call my cell, same #, i actually have mins. though, so you know, call me!!! and its verizon. if it matters, but i can talk to anyone else on verizon for free, so you all better have verizon.

I think that's all i have to say for now. seriously i am going to write in here a lot this summer, it will be my best friend....

much love,

<P>my dad is such a jerk sometimes. its like no1 nos this stuff but him and when we dont know it hes like duh its this blah blah blah. and its like wtf we didnt no that. and it all has to do with bikes, so if my brother asked him something about a bike and he like said it wrong, my dad will start yellin @ him and correcting him and then he'll look @ me and start laughing @ my brother and its like okay well i didnt no that either, does that mean im stupid. it just pisses me off sometimes. so now hes yellin @ my brother for some stupid remark he probably said. and the stupid dog ate my gum and messed up everything on my bed. And the gum was like all over my floor and its was all chewed and shit, sometimes i hate thats tupid emo dog lol.okay well&nbsp;now im here writing this, listening to taking back sunday and talking to emily. </P>

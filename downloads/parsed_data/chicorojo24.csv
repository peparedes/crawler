"event","well, sunday night was horrid. i absolutely could not sleep after my fucking roommate turned the light on when he came in at 2:30 in the morning. i was so hot and nervous, and had fitful sleep. i finally did fall asleep at like 6, so i slept until almost noon, which is really unlike me. after that, i got up and went to fred meyer's. i camped next to the starbucks and deli, hitting both of them up as i studied. i learned a lot, and felt really good about proofs up til that point. then i went back to WWU. after a short break, i started studying again, and it was HARD. so i looked up last year's tests, and had no fucking clue what the hell they were about. i studied and studied and went to bed at midnight. the next morning-tuesday- i woke up at 659, by the vibration of my phone on unmentionable parts of my body. i got up and stared at my desk from across the room for 15 minutes before i decided to get up. i met eve at the fountain, and we went in. holy shit. the test was the hardest i have ever taken in my life. luckily, we can get partial credit, so i am hoping that i got the 60% i need to pass the class. there were 3 problems worth 10 points, plus 3 extra credit problems worth three each. i basically got one right, so i got like 8-9. the other two i got prolly a 5 and a 2 on. that gives me 15 points. i needed 18 to get a 60%. so i am really hoping there are 3 points for me in the extra credit section. it took forever, but i may have passed. after that, i went to study spanish, which went really well, cause i know most of it well anyways. then kacie and i went to lunch. my test was at 1, and we got started right away. the 9 page test took me 40 minutes, so it wasn't really that bad. the subjunctive was difficult, but whatever. the hardest part was just rewriting a paragraph in the past tense, but that was just a lot of time without being difficult. kacie and i went to dinner, then i went back to my room and cleaned. when i was done except for laundry, kacie came over with hot chocolate, which i thought was the nicest thing ever. i invited her to stay, but it was almost 9, so she was going to talk to kevin. when he didnt call, she came over, and we watched laguna beach and most of real world. kevin finally called, and he had still been at the basketball games, because apparently JV went into 5 overtimes, bumping back the varsity. this morning i woke up to kacie calling, but it was a good thing i got up, because i didnt want to oversleep after a perfect night of sleep. i did some logic, then we went to lunch. i came back and did more logic, then she called to see if i wanted to go to target. we did, and then we went to haggen and fred meyer's so i could but scratch tickets. i won 9 bucks, then lost all of my 12. i am retarded. then i went to work on logic with eve, and cyd came along, but i am doing this instead- so that's how logics going..... ;)"

then we went to kortneys. for some reason, kevin was being like really physical, so i pushed him back. then we started wrestling. holy fucking shit, no wonder it is called fag tag. however, i would like to point out that he got a handful of me more than vice versa. but then we sat down, and i started rubbing his chest, and all of this stuff, and finally i ended up with his testicle in my hand. all in all, a good night! so, i am a sinner...

then on saturday i got up and my dad and i, with the minimal help of my brother, put up christmas lights. pretty sure i thought i was going to wet myself, between my dad with his little invention to put up lights and thinking he was a genius and my brother sitting there quoting elf and napoleon dynamite. not to mention i was in a weird mood anyways. brynn wasnt going to be off of work until 4, so i called at like 445. eventually.....we got together at kortneys. then we waited and waited and waited for meghan to get there. finally she did and we went to taco time. no one else wanted anything cause they are stupid! so i didnt want anything, but i was convinced to get something because brynn decided to. guess who brings my stuff! janine. fuck shit jesus christ. that was tense. she was just like, hey trevor! i wanted to gag. she was so nice, no one could figure out that we hadn't been talking for what, like.....9 months. went back to kortneys and watched talk sex with sue johanson. it was funny, then meghan and tez left. kevin was no fun, and a little mean b/c he hadn't slept due to an early work schedule. then kortney elbowed me, bitch. finally, i left in time to be home for my curfew. this morning i cleaned cuz crazy donna ""do u wanna"" nicoletti was coming. then i went to a crazy day of work, went to rite aid, and to late night breakfast. the end!"

"event","well, today was delightfully boring in general. I woke up (basically) to a call from allie, letting me know that she wanted to get together and practice our skit for spanish- which is worth 10% of our grade. we practiced for a bit, then i went to lunch. rather than going to math, i stayed in my room and ""studied"" my lines. we got there, set up, and did a pretty darn good job, and the teacher kept telling us that, so that was good. after that, i watched the news, started my RA application, tried to quit my job, and then cleaned the shit out of and reorganized my room and bathroom. it is much better now. then i went to dinner, and now i am here. later, i plan on watching west wing, then going to dinner, coming back and studying. obviously, i need my daily dose of ann coulter's witty banter, then i will try and sleep. in the morning, i will brush up on current events, then run about 18 miles. (obviously am complete lazy lying bastard. will really wake up too late, maybe study, and then go in to take the quiz, and find out how i did on my exam.) then we get to see all of the rest of the skits, and then i am basically done with classes. we have a review day in math also, so all is good. i will see my adam one more time, and then probably never again, with my luck. damn."

"event","Goodness me! Looking back now, all that seems so long ago. Since then, I have graduate High School, been to Boston, DC, New York, Atlanta, Montreal, moved into college, etc, etc. I'm at Western, which I guess would be a super place, but I have realized (epiphany!) that I am not meant for institutionalized education and vice versa. I learn much better on my own, and I have found that college is difficult, not as far as subject matter, but personally. I detest classes and teachers and assignments and all of that. While I have never been a counter culture alternative type, I have found that the system doesn't work. Now I am lazy and apathetic towards schoolwork, while I put amazing energy into extracurricular learning. Right now, I am trying to learn Japanese, with the help of my Japanese roommate. Anywho. I am still lusting after Jake, and Brandon, and there is this kid named Adam Summer I would kill for in my math class. Beautiful. Right, forgot. There was that little election. FUCK YES! I won. Rather, George Bush won, much to the chagrin of Rather. ha! Am v. witty and intelligent. Now that I am on here again, will post more often."

"event","It truly is one of life's little ironies that everyone I do not want wants me and everyone I do, doesn't. All of the girls in my life, pretty much, excluding the obvious, want me, or have wanted me in the past. I think it is because all girls are truly lesbian deep down, and are really searching for a cross between a girl and the idol of their fathers. At the same time, most guys are too busy with the physical aspects of girls and sex. Hence, I am fucked. I want these boys who don't want me, but want the girls who do want me but can't have me. Jesus!

     Another irony is that while Jake and I were good, I never except for once dreamt of him, and boy was that a hot dream! However, now that he wants to kick my ass yet again, and we do not talk, I have been having dreams about him! Dreams, in order, the last two nights:

     That I crashed the Senior Honors Luncheon, even though I was helping...??? An armed guard, yes, a man with a gun, came to take me down...is this porn or what? So i hid in the back freezer at Baskin Robbins, and Jake was in there. He told me that he didn't hate me, but that he could never be with me. I cried.

     Then last night I dreamt that Jake and I lived together in my house with my family, and it was just like a normal day, but he was all mine!

     Am disgusted with work, due in large part to the fact that I basically have no schedule. My schedule can change daily, so it is good that I go in there even when i am not working. I am just so mad, especially since I have things to do, and try to do them when I am not scheduled to work, like major Green River assignments. Then to top it all off, Chelsey scheduled me to work this weekend. I am sorry, but I got that off a month ago, first come, first serve. Now she is trying to pin me with a guilt trip and shit, and I am on the end of my rope. I will quit if she tries to make me work. Then maybe I can go work at Sunset. That would actually be fun! Anwyho, I am loving my schedule without 3rd or 6th period. Subtracting 1st and 5th would be great too!"

"event","Hoy, I took dos, count, dos AP examenes! Jesus they just want me to jump off the edificio. Despues de la escuela, fui a mi casa y got Conner a las 5. After that I called kate up cause I thought it would be fun to ver una pelicula. Yo tuve razon! We watched CAMP, which I had never heard of. It was based on a camp where talented, or not so talented, teens go to perform musicals throughout the summer. All these kids, mostly gay boys and girls seeking fame were surprised when Vlad came, as he is straight. The movie revolves around how a drag queen, Michael, wants Vlad but Vlad is wanted by these two other girls, and likes one of them. Michael has been told by Vlad to see if he could be straight, so he sleeps with Di. Vlad then makes out with Di. Ellen, the girl he did like, sees them and gets mad. So, Michael is best friends with Ellen, so he is pissed at Vlad. Being an attention and affection whore, he strips naked for Michael and tries to get him to have a go. But Michael is a little disenchanted with Vlad. In the end, Ellen, Michael, and Vlad have resolved their inner issues and are friends, despite the social boundaries that separate them. Touching, and fucking hot. MOTHER OF JESUS was he hot! Perfect body that I would so do! Right Now! AHORA! Besides that, Elizabeth had her birthday and gets a fucking car! Jesus. She is 16. I am 18. I should get a car, but no. That would be too logical. She could take my shitty truck until she is 18, then it could go to Conner. Cause it will be sitting here anyways! Anywho, I want him. And I am going to Manhattan, so hopefully I will bump into him, seven blocks north of Washington Square Park.

"event","Had the most explicit talk with a straight guy in person tonite. Went by BR on my way to Safeway and saw Shawna's car. So i thought she might be hurt or something, cause it was almost 11 by then. So i stopped in and she was in the car with greg. so we all start talking, greg, shawna, kortney, and me. and shawna and i start talking bout boys and stuff, then how i know a lot about people's penises, like size, cut or not, etc. So I am like, just for example, if we walked into Safeway right now I bet there is someone I could definitively say was a southern jew or not. and he's like, well i work at safeway. so i am like, so what kind of guy am i meeting. so he straight up tells me that he is not cut and that he is supposedly hung, or so people have told him. Then we talk more and he is like, yeah i have teabagged with a guy before! So i was like, interesting, do tell! Appartenly he was wrestling with haukenberry, and his balls fell out of his underwear, and ended up in haukenberry's mouth. and i was so elated just to find out he is a wrestler! I invited him to come over and demonstrate wrestling in his singlet, and possibly that particular move! Jesus I was on a roll. So i ask him how hung is he, and he said I dunno, pretty hung. big balls too, at least thats what people tell me. So i was asking how many people see his cock, and he just laughed. There was a lot more to it, but it was an hour long or something, so I am a little fuzzy. But Shawna and I decided that we all needed to go to IKEA, and that he could possibly demo for me his wrestling. LOL. They have prom tomorrow, but she is going with hot athlete named Dawson, sexy name! Greg is the one handed greg who tried to feel her up...well, he did, but she eventually stopped it! YAY. save that for me, eh? 

Until Later,

"event","Well, worked again, third night in a row. Fuck i am tired. Today I got my progress report which was worse than i thought. The F grade was actually a serious mistake on the part of my chemistry teacher, but it scared the shit out of me. I should really get like a B/ B+. This would give me an A, B, C, D, and Pass. Fuck that pissed me off. What the hell is wrong with me? Also today, as I was trying to sort that out with Haas during Break/ 3rd, Jake came in late.  I was at the little sign in table, along with other late people. So he went to his seat before Haas yelled at him. So he had to wait and then sign in with me a foot away. I did not even look at the White Trash bastard, so I hope he won't be a cock and think I would still even want him while he is being such a dick. What else. Tomorrow is the AP Euro. I really hope I do well. I will just fucking die if I don't. 300 something dollars down the fucking drain if I don't. I have a potty mouth. People I veritably love right now: Family, at times, Ashlee, Kortney, Rachel, Shawna, Lacey, Kate, etc. People I veritably hate: Jake and Janine, and other peeps from the past, even though I am virtually incapable of hatred, making veritable a lie. Fuck it all. All I really want besides vast wealth and boys to oogle and have a go with is to go to college and have a life.

"event","So, today I took the AP World History Exam. Holy Shit, Holy Shit, Holy Shit! I didn't remember how boring that was from the last one I took. The multiple choice was fairly easy, but the essays were harder. In recent news, I am friends again with my ex-best friend, I have been studying my ass off, and my best friend slept with my love interest. (Lust interest???) I cannot even imagine why I like this kid, him being straight, white trash, and fairly mean. It is only 19 days until I am 18, and I am so incredibly excited. At present, I don't know what the hell I am doing, however. I think my grades were incredibly shitty, for me at least. I have been just so excited.nervous.angry.sad.gleeful.oblivious.stressed. lately, that I cannot concentrate on pretty much anything. This AP thing was a big change, having to study so much, but I did read about 300 pages in two days of a delightfuly dry, inhuman textbook to study, so how is my concentration now, eh? If I could only see where my life was headed, I think I would be able to actually care about school. As of right now, all I want to do is go to college and study overseas, then have a job in which I can travel extensively, have a position of authority, and learn about languages and cultures. I have seriously been considering joining the Peace Corps, then maybe going to work for the diplomatic corps or some other government agency, although I don't know. Perhaps I could work in DC in the White House or other government body. Life is so confusing now, and it doesn't help to lose a best friend for months, love a straight boy, have that boy and ur best friend hook up and hear from someone else, and to be a gay jewish kid. Christ on a cracker when does this get easier? But I think I am truly the happiest right now, because of the people I love and have around me. I am so glad for Kate, Kortney, Ashlee, Rachel, Ann, Felicia, Jackie, Jake even though i hate him right now and vice versa, my family, and my other friends. PS Cancun is where all the hot guys live, I found them! ! ! ! ! ! YAY -Trevor-"

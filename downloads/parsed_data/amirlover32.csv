"event","I am so in love with Amir.  He just makes everything in my life better.  And I realized that today because I was in such a bad mood cause my mom was being a bitty, and I called and whined to him on his voicemail and when he called me, just the feeling of overwhelming happiness came to surface and I started to cry just because of that.  I love him so much!

I just keep thinking about my future, and our future, and his future, and I really do see us together.  I can't see me diong what I want to without him as my support.  Because he has supported me almost ALL school year so far, just knowing that if I need him he's there, it's gotten me through a lot the past 4 months... and I knowt hat I will have that feeling for the rest of my life, because I willh ave him.

Besides that... I'm tired... like REALLY tired, and I'm trying to stay awake so I can talk to him, but now Bitchney Spears came on the radio and she's making me what to kill myself... that's not good.  This Friday night should be fun... we're having Disciple Now at church, where we stay a weekend at a host family w/friends and just have fun... I'm only gonna stay Friday night because I want to see Amir on Saturday!!!  I love him!!!!  And yeah... I'm just excited I won't be stuck in the house ALL weekend, I have plans TWO nights, Friday... church... Saturday... my baby!

Hehe... I'm in a happy mood, but I'm still tired... so I'm gonna go wait for him to get home!

Talk to ya'll later...

I don't want to really do anything today besides see him... I need to clean and stuff I just don't want to.  it's too hard.  I need to buy garbage bags first and just throw a lot of stuff away... half the stuff on my floor is just junk!!  That's all!

I am glad Alayna gets back from wherever today... I feel like I haven't talked to her in like 3 weeks, but ti's really only been 3 days.  haha.

I feel tired, but I just woke up like an hour and a half ago.  I gotta go get my cousin Timothy so i can babysit him... today's gona be really long and boring... unless amir comes... just wait... i promise, and i bet that nothing will go my way... cause everyone's just laying around, my dad and sister are asleep, and my mom's just chillin on the couch eating and probably falling asleep soon.

HEHEHEEEE

I need to go i'm just way weird right now!

"event","Okay... first of all I want to tell Hanna that I'm sorry that you thought I was mad at you.  I wasn't... everyone was ignoring me at church, that's why me and Josh left so fast... I didnt' mean to bug you or nothing, I didn't even do anything, I just secluded myself and only mentioned Kristi because she wasn't acting like that... BUT... :)  I love you still and always will :)  Hehe!

Anyway... today was not a good day... i don't think me and my one friend that drinks and drives will EVER be friends again.  We haven't been that close since like over the summer, VDay we went shopping and that was fun... but still... we just aren't what we used to be, I'll always love her, there's no doubt about that, but I just can't deal with it anymore... she's so depressed like and she won't talk to me about it... i don't even know her anymore, and if she doesn't want me to... then I guess I can't... so it's not my fault... right?!

Work was okay today... tough a lil' at first, because it felt like it took, well it did take about 3 1/2 hours to stuff those damn newsletters with all of the interuptions we had... I didn't even get to do the mail.  But NO... I had to leave work RIGHT when it struck 4:00 because if I would have left earlier I would have got bitched at.  I just hate life anymore... no one knows except Amir cause no one cares... maybe he doesn't... oh well he'll hear it anyway because he loves me and I'm going to tell him if I want to!!! YA, lol... :)  I just cannot wait... THREE MORE MONTHS!!!!  I need out of school so I can do more things besides be bored all the time.  I just want to finally completely get out of there... no summer vacation!!!  Just NO SCHOOL period.  I am thinking about going to Creative Images... the cosmetology school... it's close to Dayton... I dunno though... HMMMMMMM... I will have someone help me decide.  I'm gonna look up imformation on it, it will be cool too because if I start going in the fall... I'll be going the same time as Paige... I think... and she's pretty cool.  hehe.

ANYWAY... i'm fat and i'm hungry... so I'm gonna go eat... I can't wait til' tomorrow because I FINALLY get to see Amir... it's been a week, and I just need him really bad!  Can't wait to go shopping tomorrow either!!

I got the new Daily Strengthening Treatment from Pantene Pro-V... and I'm really excited because I found split ends and it's bugging me!!!!!!  I hate that... but I'm going to completely recontruct my hair and I just finished trimming it... and I'm gonna go get it completely died in 2 weeks, and THEN... my hair will feel and look as nice as it used to when my hair was really pretty!  My friend Kristi has like the most GORGEOUS hair and I HATE IT, lol jk... I love it, mine will enver look like that though.  I need to trim my fingernails and put clear polish on them.

I am way too girly today!!!!!!!  LoL... sorry I'm sure I'm bugging most of you with my prissiness, but today after work was just great... because I hated school and work and the littlest things have been exciting me because I HATE SCHOOL AND WORK!  THREE MORE MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyway, I really miss my boyfriend... as usual, and I cannot wait because he's geting off work in 24 mins and I get to talk to him in like 56 mins!!!!


Lol... i'm helping my friend Kyle out with his girlfriend... he wants to do something nice for her, ""just because"" and I told him to do the same thing I did fr Amir on VDay, because I, being a girl, know I would appreciate that!  I really want to go to a hotel w/Amir... just like to be alone, because we NEVER are... not for sex purposes you perverts... just so it can be me and my baby.  We have never really had time like that... well once... but that was a very long time ago!!!  I know I sound like i'm married to him when i say this... but we need time to focus on us... not worrying about what next.. ya know? just live in the moment, because that is fun, and i love him and i need to be with him alone sometimes!

Anyway, i'm gonna go dry my hair and stuff... talk to yas later!  Oh yeah... Hanna u definetly rock and i'll tell you why later!!!!!!  Love you!!!!!

"event","Today was quite dumb... It was just stupid... today should have never happened, it was just a stupid day!!!!  2 of my friends were coming in late because they went to a club, well... I was talking to my friend Alayna, because she asked about one of them drinking and driving, and that just started a whole thing because someone heard me say something about being drunk, they didn't even drink!  It was just stupid, well I know one of them got really pissed and she went to the ""bathroom"" which I'm sure she went to find this other friend and tell them what happened, so I was guessing that they were both really pissed at me, but now I don't know, cause me and one of them, talked online tonight and well... it didn't seem to go so bad... i just completely explained to her what happened and told her ""you take it however you want... it's up to you now""... well I guess she just sorta dropped it, and so did I because it's all stupid.

Anyway, Teresa told me at work that she got a lot of complaints again because I left work on Friday early... WELL... I just decided to announce to the office ""these people that work here are always complainging about how they don't have time to get anything done... well maybe if they quit focusing what i'm doing wrong... they would get a whole lot more done!"" so maybe people who were in the office at the time that were complaining will take a hint.  I know 2 ladies that are complaining are the nurses Deb & Stephanie, you could tell that they were annoyed with me today, they just kind of looked past me... WHATEVER!!!!!!

THEN... to top it all off, I had a dream that my ex boyfriend called me and said I love you before we got off the phone, which I didn't say anything except ""ok"" as usual, but yeah... that jsut freaked me out, it better not be a sign!!!!!!!!  AHHHHH... I really need my boyfriend at the moment because I love him!!!!!!!!!!  And he's the only one I want to be with at the moment!  I love him so much!

3 more months!!  3 more months!!  3 more months!!  3 more months!!  3 more months!!  3 more months!!  3 more months!!  3 more months!!  3 more months!!  3 more months!!  3 more months!!  3 more months!!  And I won't have to worry about anything that has to do with that work or this stupid school... I can drop whatever I want and pick up whatever I want!  

I really miss my boyfriend, and he's supposed to call me on his 9:30 break, so I'm gonna go ahead and get off and wait for him, then hit the shower and go BACK to sleep :) after I do a LITTLE bit of homework!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Love always,

"event","OMG... I am so annoyed, this weekend completely sucked my ass.  Friday was just a waste of days of the week, I went to school, work completely blew, I came home early, that was fun, hung out w/Alayna for a little bit, went out to dinner with my friends, went out w/my sister for a while hanging out and shoppin around, then at like 9:40 my dad called and told us it was ""getting late and we needed to come home"" what the fuck!?  Okay... it's a Friday night and we have to be in by 10?  Bullshit.  So we came home had a big ol' fight at home, i talked to amir pretty much all night, we argued, believe it or not, then i went to bed.

I woke up saturday, omg... boring day AGAIN.. I dont' even remember what I did all day, all i know is that i looked like hell ALL day, and just sat around being bored.  so I talked to amir a LITTLE bit Saturday night as usual, then went to bed.

Today, my lord, my parents were FINALLY out of the house, but did I get to be alone?  Of course not, my sister amanda and my lil cousin megan was here.  AH... so we ended up goign shopping which was okay, then iw ent and hung out at josh's from like 3:30 - 4:45, went to church which sucked, I love Kristi to death, but everyone else jsut got on my nerves.  Okay, we can be nice to Stephanie one day but the next two times we see her, lets ignore her... assholes.  the ONE song was good, the rest sucked because no one can sing, we had Craig, Abby, Molly (which she can be good) and weber and casey, they CAN'T sing... so it made us all look bad.  BLAH... it was like all the girls were trying to compete to be the loudest and they sounded like hell.  so then i took josh home and he's a complete dick so i made him walk to his house from the end of the street because he was pissing me off, then i went home, to find that my boyfriend who was supposed to be here at 8:30 like he said... (it was 8:12 at th etime), well he's at his dad's by the time i finally got ahold of him, it was quarter til 9, so by the time he got to his house to drop of his brother, it would be 930, and to get to my house, it would be 10 til 10... and he has to leave at 101!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm just a little bitter at the moment.  And my friend are going clubbin tonight so they probably won't be at school tomorrow, and tha tmeans it's just me and alayna, an di'm just not in a good mood, i think i'm going to get ready for bed and just lay down... if amir calls, he calls, if not... FINEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!

GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","When you really think about it, there's just not enough time in the world.  Two people I know died unexpectedly Thursday night, One with something I've never heard of and Two from getting hit by a drunk driver.  Life is too short and you will never know when your time will be cut off.  I mean, mine could be tomorrow, 50 years, or even in like 5 seconds.  Lately I've been really trying to tell people how much I care for them.  And it is hard.  Because I don't know that a lot of people care, or if a lot of people understand.  

I just hope and pray that everyone knows that any second your life and be shut off, and I hope that you all let everyone know how much they mean to you before your time or their's is taken away.

So for all of you reading this, I hope you are having a great day, and I hope you can take into consideration what I am meaning.

In the last 3 + years there has been so many deaths hitting so close to home, I just hope they all died knowing the love of Jesus Christ and knowing also that I loved them all.  With more love than you'd ever think you could posess, until you lose someone who has all of that love, and you find yourself drained.

Dear Lord, i pray that you watch over everyone tonight
please put your arm around each and everyone of us tonight
let us feel your presence and somehow in some way
please let us feel your love and have some kind of knowledge
that you will always be there.

I love you very much, and I pray in Jesus' most precious name,

AMEN"

Finally got the nerve, and it feels great to be away from those mean people who look at me like I'm dumb.  There's only a few new people, and Kelly, he's really cool, but he's really like outgoing and stuff, and he gets along w/everyone easily, i get along w/him, steve, katie (who i haven't even worked with) and denise... but no one is training me... They just about ""use"" me to do the dishes all the freakin time.  BLAH!

Anyway, I miss Amir a lot, I hate not seeing him, sometimes when I think of him it's almost like he's here, I dunno y, lol.  I'm home alone right now, it's nice... but that won't be for long... oh well!  I am working on my Holocaust project for Modern.  It's kind of interesting because I like the stuff we're learning about.  I'd rather learn on my own then listen to lectures.  

I need to start figuring out what I want to do after high school... cause I'm not quite sure yet.  I kind of want to be a teacher, lol.. but at the same time I don't, I want to do a lot of things.  I don't know yet.

When I'm with him, especially after I have a long hard day, I am just omg, i'm completely a new person, it's unbelieveable.  I love him with all of my heart and soul.  Recently, lol... Thursday, we added something new to our relationship and it's just made us grow closer.  I can't believe how much we've grown and how our love is just on fire.

Sometimes, when I think of how to express my love to him, I can't find the words to say!  Our love is just so amazing.  The perfect song for our relationship would be Ginuwine ""Differences"".  He has made such a difference in my life, and I know by what he's told me about his past, that I've made his life completely change.  He is my best friend, my lover and my soulmate, no one could ever take his place.

Tonight he was supposed to leave when we got home from ""bowling"" lol... and that was at 11:20 and we jsut sat in my car and talked and cuddled and listened to music.  Then my dad came out, lol... oh well... my dad's an idiot... i don't like him most of the time... he's annoying, today both of my parents were on my nerves BAD, but I'm over it.  Kinda... just cause Amir made me feel better.

I LOVE AMIR FOREVER!!!!!!!!

Or is it just a dream?
I look at you 
and can't belive you're real.
You've swept me off my feet,
and I'm completely overwhelmed
by the warm and special way
you make me feel.

Every time I think of you
my heart begins to race,
and I find that I am longing
for your kiss.
You're simply irresistible-
like no one else I've known-
and I never knew
that love could be like this.

So if I'm only dreaming
please don't ever wake me up,
for there's nothing else
that I would rather do
Than dream my life away
in the enchantment of your arms-
every moment falling more
in love with you.

This was the poem in Amir's Valentine's Day card to me!  Makes me cry!  I'm not gonna put what HE wrote in it, but it was beautiful!  I love you so much, Amir!!!!

Damn, I'm tired, today was dramatizing, but that's over too, thank god... I got to see JDR... Lol, Josh...

I forgive her though, at least she's not telling me that she wants my boyfriend, that's all I need.  I just really want to go home.  I have to go to school the rest of the day, then work, then go home get changed and go to work.  I really don't need this shit right now.  I'm just in one of those moods that I want to see someone fall and get hurt.  Because i'm sick of being hurt.

I HATE AMIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But you see, I am lying.  I don't.  I love him SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much.  I can't lie about that.  I can't stand this.  We don't need to do this, if he wants her, he can have her even though he can't get her.  Even if he wasn't w/me, he's not her type, and she doesn't like him.  

I've had this trouble before w/Mike.  The guy thinks they're sexy and can get whatever they want, and that I'm just their piece, and in reality, they're not as hot as they think.  I think Amir is attractive, yeah... but not every fuckin girl in the world is going to.

"event","I had a great weekend!!!  Well, Saturday night, before Amir got here, he called and said he wasn't going to be here until almost TEN!!!!  i about cried, cause that would have totally ruined my surprise... well... my surprise was instead of going to a really fancy restaurant, I made a CANDLELIT dinner!  It was really cute... :)  I think he liked it... he acted kind of surprised when he walked in... I got him a promise ring for VDay, and for christmas, he got me one of the Bella Italia charm bracelets with 2 purple hearts and my name in really pretty jewels, and for VDay, he added 2 pink hearts and his name :)  It's so pretty.  He spent the night Saturday and Sunday ngiht, and stayed until about 10 til 4 today.  It was so much fun... he just saw another side of me, he's never been around me for about 48 hrs straight, lol... he needs to get used to it.  I wasted about $500 this wekeend though, $300 w/the rings, which i'm getting a lil' over 100 back, plus dinner sat night, lunch twice and dinner sunday.  I just need to really watch my money and not go out to eat w/him as much.

I loved it, Sunday and this morning, when I woke up, I would go in my room where he was sleeping and I would lay down with him.  I love just being in there w/him.  I love him so much.  I'm just afraid he didn't have a good time.  The one thing I don't understand about him, is his money, oh well... I'm not saying ""i wish he'd buy me the world"" cause that's not important to me, but I mean, he's making a hell of a lot more money than I do, and yeah, i have 2 jobs, but I haven't even gotten into my second job that much yet.  So okay, i got paid a $111 Friday, it's ALL gone except for $2 and some change... and it was all on him, and $10 in gas... okeey?  OH whoopey, 2 packs of cigarettes.  Like I said, I'm not expecting him to just buy dinner all the time, but it wouldn't hurt to help out.  

ANYWAY, I'm reallys ad right now because today's not my favorite day of the year, I jsut wish he was back here again!  I love him so much!  I mean sure, there's things about him i won't understand, and sometimes things might upset me, etc, but that doesn't mean i don't love him.  I love him more than anything!  I just I dunno... everything's so beautiful to me, I don't want to mess anything up, and I don't know how to tell him things are bothering me.  I'll think about it, the last thing I want to do after a great weekend like this is screw it all up.  I just can't wait to see him on Thursday!  :)  

I need to get a stupid little card thing from the bank so I won't always have money laying around and i can't blow it all!!  That would be great... cause my friend has one, and she seems to have hold of her money.  I don't know... it was weird, going from absolutely no money of my OWN, and now I have my own, but I really have to pay for everything.  And i'm not saying ""i have it so bad"" blah  blah, cause i know i don't, but i mean, some of my friends have their own money but when it comes to some things, they can just ask their parents, i even have to pay for my $60 medicine every 2 weeks, that SUCKS, but hopefully once I start getting into taco bell, I can save more money, and quit blowing it.  

OKAY, I'm going to go now... i need a nap.  :)

Talk to you later!

It was only $20 man!  Made me happy.  Then we went out to eat... well just to McDonalds, and we talked all day, she's got things in her life that's bringing her down, but I don't know how to respond to them, I just don't.  I wish I had really good advice, but I can't think of any when things like this come up!  I can only think of it when it's my own problem and I never listen to myself anyway.

I am really tired actually.  Maybe I should take a nap.  Hmm... i could set my alarm for 4, OMG... it's 4:20, maybe I can sleep until like 5:30... have time to do my hair and makeup, set the table and everything, cause most stuff is ready, after i do my hair I have to cook!  :)  That's my plan, he thinks we're going out to a really expensive restaurant and then to the movies, when in reality, I'm cooking and rented a movie!!!!  I am making Chicken Alfredo, Salad, and I bout a cake and we have Ice Cream!!!!!!!!!!!!  And I rented American Wedding, cause it's my favorite movie, lol... and I don't like his favorite movie, lol The Matrix, it's just not my thing, so he'll live with this.

Anyway, I need to finish my laundry and get stuff together so I can take a small nap... I HOPE... he's spending the night tonight!!!!  :)"

"event","LoL... work was eventful... I kind of felt stupid because I had to ask so many questions, but you know... what's how you learned, and I learned a lot.  My biggest lesson though was to never wear work pants before u wash them, cause you'll get a ""pants burn"" on your legs... OUCH!!!!! I did the dishes for HOURS, and I cannot get that stupid sanatizer smell off my hands!

Anyway, I'm so excited about tomorrow night... I'm going all out, I got these cute things from miejer... and i have an idea on how to wrap his present... omg i'm so excited.  I think he's going to be very happy w/me... but he's gonna see my ""giddy"" side, lol!

ANYWAY... i'm gonna go brush my teeth, and get my work clothes COMPLETELY off cause i stink!

~Steph... i'll write more later or tomorrow!"

I am so excited and I have a hard time keepings secrets if it's not going to hurt someone in the long run.  I am having a really hard time keeping the present a secret... lol... my mom had to get a big old paper box cause it's so big, lol.

"event","I absolutely love my boyfriend.  He's like the best thing on earth.  Everyone says they have ""the best boyfriend"" but how can that be if i have the best one?  OMG... Alayna, I absolutely love you too.  You are the greatest friend!  You have been making the last part of Senior Year so much easier and exciting!  Can't wait til PROM!!!!!!!!!

Get this, most girls think in order to keep their boyfriend they HAVE to have sex w/him.  My boyfriend doesn't care... if we want something, we're bound to get it, lol... but it doesn't absorb our whole relationship.  We have such a tight ""bond"" i guess you could call it, lol, and it just makes everything so much easier, and I CANNOT wait until Valentine's day because It's just going to be exciting!  I can't wait til he gets his gift.  He thinks he knows what it is... it's just funny.  But what he thinks is not even close, my gift cost more and it's bigger than that.  and it's not jewelry, but u can wear it.  haha... it comes in a ""---box""  lol!  Guess again baby!

I dunno if he'll read this or not.

I am trying to finish my COE PowerPoint, but it's not coming along to well because it's not organized... I need a plan.

Anyway, I can't wait til Saturday, I have a great plan for what to do with him, and I am just excited... and I love him... me and Shanda are going shopping to get an outfit, and then i'm going to get my hair done, not died and everthing, but something done to make me look at least decent.  I LOVE HIM!!!!!!!

Well, I called him cause he's home now, so I'm gonna go... I'll talk to you in here tomorrow!

Love, ~Steph"

"event","My boyfriend should be here in like 15 minutes, that really excites me.  Yeah... he's here, I guess I underestimated the time!!!  :)

Anyway, work was fine today.  Teresa wasn't there... but I found out that Ms. Gresham is another person that complained about me using the phone so much... well I have the perfect place that she can put that phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

Teresa's mom isn't doing very good so she won't be there tomorrow or today.  My boyfriend's Mommy did his hair... :) hehe... he's so cute.

"event","Whoa, today was just WHOA... first of all, I ran late for school, so we all JUST got in the doors when the bell was getting ready to ring, 1st period was kind of boring, I just hate Hamlet!  3rd period was stupid, some people thought I stole a disk from COE, which I didn't, i took 2 home tonight, and neither of them were that one.  SO THERE!  Then, Mrs. Morris called me back into her office, GREEEAT... She said that last week when she emailed my supervisor, when she emailed back she said that ""i seem very distant and like something's really bothering me.""  Well, the only reason I've acted so weird is because I thought I was annoying her, which I've mentioned on here and because on Monday, the 16th, it will be 3 years since my brother has died, so of course I have things on my mind.  Well, I didn't think Teresa understood.

Well, me and Alayna went to lunch and then I took her to work then I went to work, I was on my way to do the mail and as I was leaving, Teresa told me ""I need to talk to you in a little bit"".  I immediatly started to like fall apart.  I was thinking ""what could I have done wrong?"" and I couldn't think of anything, so I figured it had to do with what Mrs. Morris said.  So I was fretting ALL day long over this and before I got ready to leave, i asked Teresa if she needed to talk to me yet and she took me out in the hall and she said ""people have been complaining about you using the phone all the time""  DO WHAT?!?!?!  I do use the phone, but I don't do it while I have something to do... if I have nothing to do then I'll go down to the copy room if it's not busy and I'll get on the phone there.  But Teresa's not mad, she said ""the way I see it, you work for us... not them... so don't worry about it"".  I haven't even called anyone for fun in like a week or more.  I try to call my boyfriend sometimes when I don't have anything else to do... but only then.. there's no one else for me to call anyway, just my mom, and yeah... u get me?

But I feel a little better, I'm so relieved that Teresa isn't mad or upset with me.  She completely understands, she just wanted to warn me to watch my back because you can't trust anyone, and I definetly learned that.

OH... and I'm stupid... I forgot my stupid Modern AH folder AGAIN... so I hope my mom doesn't forget to go get it from my work on her way home... nope, I called her she didn't!  

ANYWAY, I've had quite a stressful day, and I'm hungry, so I'm going to go get a snack and then sleep.  I will update you later if something happens!!!

"event","Today was good.  I actually finished the major part of my homework that was due today, so I was proud, in English, we got our group assignments, I am a little upset because my friend Alayna isn't in my group cause it's fun working w/her... but i'm really happy cause my 2 favorite friends Shanda & Stacy are in my group! :)  I started to understand Hamlet a LITTLE bit, we took a quiz and me, Alayna & Shanda cheated, hehe... but I got a 12/18... which is a D+ but had I not cheated... I would have got an F!  

Work was hectic, I was busy for the most part, but my supervisor has been upset lately and I couldn't tell why and I was under the impression I was like an annoyance to her.  Well, I don't think that so much anymore, because I found out her mom is in the hospital... well that happened last night, and I have felt like this for like 2 weeks.  I guess I'll end up getting over it, I only have 3 months of work left anyway!  I had things to do, and when I left, my ""inbox"" was filled up so it excited me to know that I'm not going to be bored tomorrow... at least ALL day.  

Well, time to eat supper!  I'll talk to ya'll later!

"event","Hey guys... don't make fun of me this is my FIRST entry.  SO anyway, today was my first day back at school, I didn't really go Thurs or Fri... field trips... So i was a little overwhelmed when in Modern American History I got 2 packets to read, plus and essay, and a map... where you label countries or whatever... I'm so pooped.  I took a nap... which was needed, but I should have done without!  Now it's 11:05 and I haven't started anything, I just can't get motivated.  

I cannot wait for my boyfriend to get off work... I have to say up til at LEAST 12 to talk to him... I hope I don't fall asleep on him tonight, lol... I do that quite often.  

Other than all this crap, I'm doing really good... just tired... ha... but I am always tired.  I'm having issues with gas money too... don't you think your parents should help out if you promise to pay them back!?  My daddy gave me gas... :) but mom was quite ticked... oh well... She'll get over it, my daddy just loves me and wants me to get to and from work/school safely!  I'm somewhat spoiled from him.. :)  but that's alright... i'm a Daddy's girl :)

Anyway, I better go do my homework... if i'm telling the truth... you'll find out tomorrow!  Hah!  Ttyl... Love, Steph"

"event","So im writing in here because i am almost positive no one will read this...and if you do just dont because im only writing because i need to and i dont know how to make it private


So basically today sucks...im sick of being ditched by my friends....ok this is selfish i know but i am the type of person who needs attention...as said in church my love type is attention...i dont feel loved if i dont get to talk/hang out with people...i cant help it...i wish i could but whenever someone asks if i wanna do something and i say yes that usually means your going to do something...not that oh well im using you as a back up for if i dont find other plans...so therefore i keep my day free so that i can hang out when you just completely ditch me because you found something ""better"" to do...i hate this so much cause i dont know why i feel like this...i always doubt everything and i wish i wouldnt...and its not just some people its my normal friends...i know she has other friends but whenever shed ask to hang out i always say sure...even if i dont want to i always say alright...but if i ask its..oh im going to watch a movie at angelas...never, well i called angela bout watchin a movie wanna come to?...i know i shouldnt care but i hate feeling lonely and right now for some reason thats all i feel...im use to always having someone...and if i didnt have someone i always had guard....now i dont even have that...however sad that is that was the one and only thing ive ever been good at...thats the only time ive ever been able to make friends...that was my one stable thing i had that wouldnt leave like all the rest of my friends...but i dont have it anymore and honestly i dont know what to do...i hate feeling like this all the time...i hate always saying im alright and then coming home and feeling lonely...i hate crying...i use to never cry and now its all i ever want to do...but i cant because its pointless...i have no reason to cry...my familys normal i have enough money to get by with school i have a good oldfasioned nice life...but i just feel empty...and i hate that i dont know why!...ive tried everything to feel whole...tried making friends didnt work...tried having an actual relationship, never happened...i just dont feel loved and i know i should...my parents love me even though they dont know how to show it...my friends love me even though sometimes i feel like the only reason they are there is because they have no one else...i just wish and pray that for once in my life i could be someones priority...ive always been the back up...ive always been the one who is there, oh im bored, sams always home ill call her...never well i should do my homework but ill hang with sam instead because i know shes had a bad day...theres only been once in my life that someones actually been there for me when she was supposed to be somewhere else...thats all ive ever wanted...just to have someone drop everything for me...just for once...i wanna know what it feels like to be honestly genuinly loved...the kinda love where ill be sick and theyll bring me food and force me to eat it even though i dont want to...the kinda love where ill say im lonely and 5 minutes later no matter what was going on theyll be sitting right next to me...i just want an actual relationship for once...yes i said it...the one who said shed be fine without a man, the one that swore shed never cry over a guy, the one who tells everyone else relationships are pointless...maybe thats the whole i have...a whole left there for someone who will actually care
im sick of going 19 years of my life without even once..not once..having a relationship...call me shallow but i wanna be loved

and right now im just being stupid...because i want someone there so im sticking with something that i know i shouldnt...i know it will never work...and i know that im just going to get hurt big time...and i know its not right and its not me...but im sick of being alone...i know i should stop doing this to myself but i dont know how...you might think its easy to just drop someone but its the hardest thing in the world to do...specially when thats the only person i can and do hang out with...i hate being alone and without him i would be alone every night...its probably better for me to be alone right now because things cant get better they are just going to get worse...because i know he doesnt like me...hes just being like this because he has no one else...like always im a back up...and i dont wanna be a back up but im afraid to end it cause then ill be alone...so basically im using him because i feel alone...which is wrong on my part by far but i cant help it...i need someone there...i dont have my stability anymore..im a loser but my stability was guard, always something i could do when i started to feel alone...and well now thats gone and i cant get a job and i suck at school so i got nothing but him...i would give anything in the world to just find something i could be good at and i could spend my time doing...but everything i do i suck at...i suck at being a daughter cause i can never make my parents happy, i do shitty in school and waste their money, i cant clean the house well enough, i cant have a family, i cant even get a fucking date, i cant get a job, i cant be happy, i cant stay healthy and be there for them forever

ok so thats my rant for the day...plus i havta go to the hospital agian which is pointless because they are just going to say the same thing they always say...ill get poked and proded for no reason...wasting even more money...why cant i just be normal and healthy instead of taking a bizillion pills and hiding everything...well today just sucks!"

I think perfectionism is based on the obsessive belief that if you run carefully enough, hitting each stepping-stone just right, you won't have to die. The truth is that you will die anyway and that a lot of people who aren't even looking at their feet are going to do a whole lot better than you, and have a lot more fun while they're doing it.

"event","Life is taken way to seriously sometimes. People need to learn how to live. How to express their feelings about others. They need to show that they care for others even when they dont think the other person cares back. People need to stop pretending to be people they arent. BE WHO YOU ARE!!! There is no point to live in a world where everyone is the same. I want to be different, to stand out in a crowd. I want to show the world who i am. People dont remember you by the way you act like others, they remember you for the way you act like yourself. I dont know about any of you but i wanna be remembered for who i really am. I want to impact a persons life! My goal in life is to not be famous but to change lifes. At least just one person. to make them relieze they dont have to act like everyone else to make them be happy. The greatest thing anyone has ever taught me is to be myself and i wanna pass that on....SO BE YOURSELF..

BE WHO YOU ARE AND NOT WHO SOMEONE ELSE WANTS YOU TO BE...

Its amazing the things you think of at night right before you fall asleep. If i thought like that all the time id prolly be one of the smartest ppl in the world but also one of the saddest. its amazing how sad a person can make themselves. All people need to learn is to be happy. I was that way once in jr. high...i was so frekkin depressed all the time but then once i hit highschool it just kinda hit me that how much time i spend feeling sorry for myself makes it that much harder to get along with people...So i just started being happy...even when the worst things happen like when my best friend moved to india i was still happy (at least around other people) cause if you are sad then everyone around you is sad so why be sad. My favorite thing in the world is to make a person happy and if i make someone happy then i feel like my life is perfect cause thats all i care about:) and then that makes me even happier   SO EVERYONE BE HAPPY OR ELSE...jkjk i understand when you feel sad and i want you to talk to me about it cause then maybe i can make you feel happy:) ok well i must go now so buhbye

Love ya,

"event","Well today has been sucky agian...dont you just hate those days when you feel like crap and you think everyone hates you but you really have no reason to think that everyone hates you you just do...Well thats how i am right now...I truly truly think one of my friends is mad at me though and i dont get why...i havnt done anything to make it so...and i hate it...that is one thing that i cant stand is when someone is mad at me...i dont try to do anything to make a person mad and if i do i wish they would just tell me than not talk at all...it makes me kinda mad that she doesnt just tell me why shes mad instead of not talking at all...that is the worst thing in the world to do to someone cause if you are mad at them not talking to them isnt going to stop them from doing things...they are still gonna do it just as much untill you tell them it bugs you...

and i dont get why i always complain...i mean i know its me getting mad at me but i truly dont get why i always think things in my head about people not liking me...my life isnt bad...i have a nice family...nice friends...i just hate being so afraid of people not liking me that i always think even my friends are just hanging out with me cause they feel sorry for me...i know they dont but thats just what i think sometimes...and i dont understand why i think that so if you have any idea and wanna be my shrink for the day please write me...

Well im off to do nothing on a friday night cause im just that cool...adios

"event","Life is full of lots of up and downs,
And the distance feels further 
When you're headed for the ground,
And there is nothing more painful 
Than to let you're feelings take you down,

It's so hard to know 
The way you feel inside,
When there's many thoughts 
And feelings that you hide,
But you might feel better 
If you let me walk with you by your side,

And when you need a shoulder to cry on,
When you need a friend to rely on,
When the whole world is gone,
You won't be alone, cause I'll be there,

I'll be your shoulder to cry on,
I'll be there, 
I'll be a friend to rely on,
When the whole world is gone,
you won't be alone, cause I'll be there.

All of the times when everything is wrong
And you're feeling like
There's no use going on
You can't give it up
I hope you work it out and carry on

Side by side,
With you till the end
I'll alway be the one to firmly hold your hand
no matter what is said or done
our love will always continue on"

Well today i found out a ""friend""(no names) of mine that now lives in michagen has a girlfriend...i know i shouldnt be mad cause i didnt have a chance with him anyway since he lived so far away but when you finally get a guy who likes you who is really really nice and is a really really good friend than you still have feelings for him....but NO he had to go and get a girlfriend...i know there is always someone in this world who likes you no matter what but it just feels like there really isn't...and i know it shouldnt matter weither a person likes me or not and i know i should be sad about it but there are just somedays when everything brings you down and that is all you can think about...i mean honestly all i wanna know is that there is a guy out there that likes me...plus to add on to that basically all of my guy friends have moved away so i dont even have them to talk to about certain things so it all just sucks right now...

The good thing about this weekend though is that i am home alone...PARTY...nope still cant do that cause i think my grandparents are coming to check in on me sat. night but oh well...today is ok cause i get to go bowling with two of my best friends and that should be fun cause im gonna kick there ass's...it is fun bowling with people when you can be competitive cause i am a very competitive person...
well ive gotta go now so ill talk to you all later

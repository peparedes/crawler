"event","WELL, this weekend I was in Austin, Texas with Brittany Petre, her lovely parents, and the oh-so-random Kobe. Saturday night, we saw ANI FUCKING DIFRANCO perform at the Austin Music Hall and HOLY OH MY HOLY CRAP she was COMPLETELY amazing. I just couldn't believe I was actually seeing this woman performing her incredible songs 20 feet away from me. After almost every song I didn't know how to react..haha. it was SO incredible. I didn't realize how she would affect me like she did. I don't think I stopped smiling. And I was especially happy for Brittany and Kobe because of how much they adore her. It was really great seeing them so excited. ahh.. Ani's great. Also, Andrew Bird was the opening performer and lemme tell ya, he was fucking awesome too. All the violin parts on delay that made the rhythm of his songs and the crazy guitar shit he did on top of that was inredible. He has a beautiful singing voice. I really liked watching him, except I think his whistling was fake..heh. I do believe Brittany agrees with me. It was a great night nonetheless. I loved it. :D

"event","FRIDAY-after school-Simon and I hopped into the Big Red Rocket of Love and went to the video store. There, we rented A Clockwork Orange and What's Up, Tiger Lily. Got home...mission complete. 

SATURDAY-after Friday-Simon and I watched Clockwork, then played GTASA. Prepared ourselves for the worst, then went to Taco Bell. Afterward, we went home and ate our fast-food bean slop. Got into the Big Red Rocket of Love and travelled to Grand Coteau and paid a small fee to stand by a fire (Destroyed By Fire? No.) and listen to a 311 cover band. Brittany and I travelled back to Opelousas to my home where we prepared for the worst. She and I found the nearest Chinese buffet, stopped and ate. (There was enough crab meat to stuff into one's nose.) Finally, we reached the night's destination--Lafayette, Louisiana. Stayed the night there where the worst, thankfully, did not happen. Brooke is punished, though. 

SUNDAY-after waking up at 1:10 PM-I woke up a bit more and participated in a chat in the kitchen. Where would we go from here? What would we incounter next!? 
Brittany stole music from me, then shortly after finishing, I had to depart. After the hugs and goodbyes, I began my journey homeward. Upon reaching home, I noticed the mailbox was opened...who could have done such a thing!?"

Joey's dating Chelsea and she's really cool. Joey recorded this great song yesterday while he wasn't at school. Dylan went to court today. We'll find out what happened. I want my name to be remembered for 1000 years. I figured everyone lives the same life and dies the same death, but it depends on how you live that life to determine whether you'll be remembered or not. I want to make a name for myself. I MUST be remembered. I will NOT be forgotten. Not me. I'm still possibly signing up for the Marines or the Navy after highschool. 
You know, sometimes I feel like I'm disappearing or becoming a shadow in a dark room. I feel like a ghost sometimes. I feel like that when I'm by myself. Not when I'm with people. Not my place to talk about feelings. So, I need to shit pretty bad.  I hope that crap (no pun intended) doesn't come back. The other day, my dad told me since I'm a teenager, it's natural for me to be horny. So I said, ""Yeah Dad, I'm horny. We were definitely going to fuck in there."" My mom just sat there. Well, I wasted yet ANOTHER day of my life. It's awfully sad to know that today only comes once, just as yesterday did. But, there will be more todays, but hopefully less wasted. I haven't been able to write much lately. I wrote a good bit last week. Lucky. I think more people should die. I was going to go see Brittany after school today but she pussied out because she's beautiful or just didn't want to see me.  Christmas wasn't good. I hate Christmas and thanksgiving and easter and valentine's day and labor day and all saint's day and suck my fucking dick you arrogant pigs day.

"event","<P>Well, my friends, I have been <FONT color=#3333ff>THINKING</FONT> lately and the thoughts I've been thinking have been quite new. I believe I may be the cat who's the best friend, then fades away and then you just forget but not really forget who he or she is. Everyone'll remember, of course...hopefully, and hopefully I will have left a lasting positive effect on everyones' lives. But, I hope much more for that not to happen. It's happened several several times before in my life, and this time I really don't want it to happen again. I hate fading. School was different today. I guess it's the fall and the harvest moon that was on the horizon tonight. Or maybe I'm just changing. I feel like I'm changing. I had this stupid half-smile on all day and I felt like killing someone or just blowing up. Ha ha! I really don't know what it felt like...maybe something like that, or maybe just that it's a change. I feel like a different person even. I don't feel 30 now. I feel about 20 or younger. I want to be 16 for the few months I have to be 16 left. It's sad that you can only be 14 once, and 15 once, and 16 once, and sad that things you share with people become memories, but what is motivating is the things that the future holds for you to share that will some day become feelings and moments and then memories. Oh, and I'm glad I decided on getting the Senior ring. It's going to be fabulous even if I don't wear it much. I like wearing Poppa's ring. I'm very glad he gave it to me. Anyway, Autumn's here and I still don't have a car. Report cards on their way... Pray I get no C's, my friends, please do pray for me! I pray for you all! I am trying a little harder now and I plan on trying even harder...hahaha.&nbsp; I don't know what I want anymore. I don't know who I want anymore. I don't know what I believe in anymore. A few things got mixed and thrown away recently, but for what reason, I don't know why. I feel a little perplexed and flabbergasted and happy and tired and sick all at the same time. But, for the most part I'm getting happier by the day. <FONT color=#ffcc33>Let's not turn around brothers and sisters, let us walk arm-in-arm to that horizon until we get to the other side, and then we'll sing.</FONT></P>

On another note:
Weekend In Orange Beach w/ the Petre's/Brooke.(forgive me for having everything mixed up and leaving a few parts out. I mostly left out the emotions i felt because they're a little too personal. sorry)
It was a fun drive on the way over, and we ate at Coconut Willie's when we arrived in Gulf Shores or wherever we were. After bringing all our packings and groceries to the room, Brittany, Brooke, and I walked down the fish-smelling beach. We raced back and it was fun. Next morning, Brittany woke me up and we went swimming. We went from the pool to the jac. about a million times in three days,. I don't remember when we went, but we ate at this deli place. Then, chicken for dinner and it was good. next morning, Brittany sat on my foot and woke me up. We went swimming. Oh yeah, the jetties. we played around on the jetties a lot. we ended up going to the beach where i got electrocuted and brittany hit her head on a rock. poor baby. That night we went out to eat in Florida which was down the road. WE came back and did homework. While Brittany fell asleep, I finished mine and went to sleep. Brittany woke me up and I was quite happy to be woken up that way. We went to the pools again. WE walked on the beach. Fuck, I can't remember the order everthing went in but seeing Brittany upset made me feel pretty bad, but I'm glad I was there and I hope I cheered her up. We also called Kristen one night and Joey Sunday. The ride back was fun. The ride home...hm I felt all melancholy.

I hope she goes to her locker a lot so she can see her flowers. I miss people, but it looks like a few people are starting to wish me away.

peace i guess"

It's great. maybe mix some jazz in there... hell yeah! Joey, Cory, and Al are all going to Ozzfest Wednesday. I hope they have fun. I also need an electric guitar so I can continue writing songs. I'm getting bored with writing poetry. It needs music! Flaming, spinning, whirling music. I love electric guitars almost as much as i love acoustic. But, what I really love is Frank Sinatra's voice.

We did need a little break. I called my mom at work to tell her happy birthday, but she wasn't there so i just left a message. I then called Brittany a few times to wake her up, but I didn't wake her. I called her after playing SOCOM for a little while and woke her up, so we talked for a while and i laughed. I went to Al's house to get ""I Still Have You"" for my dad to know what he'll be soloing to, and we ended up listening to a few of the new songs and they sound INCREDIBLE. I'm really fucking stoked about ""FUN"". It's going to be way better than ""Human Food"". yeaaahh.. 
So, I got back home at about 4:30, took a shower and finally got signed online and talked to Brittany for a couple of minutes, then went to Julie's house for my mom's party. I helped Tommy fix his computer because he's pretty screwy about things that don't work and all. Especially with computers, but we fixed the problem, only to run into another. Fuck it. I hope my mom had a good day. She rocks. We played SOCOM all day, and we're still playing. I love that shit. It's like Brittany and Cubis. rock on baby! I met this guy at Al's house, but I don't remember his name. Kind of only his face. He was tall, but that's about it. The guy was cool. Handing in his Popeye's uniform through the drive-thru window after he quit and then ordered some food. That's pretty fuckin knarly. I'm just hangin out now with nothing at all to do.

Will made me this great mix cd with Air, Deadboy and the Elephantmen, The Beatles, Buddy Holly, The Shins, and Elliott Smith. It's incredible! I'm glad he made it for me. A few minutes after Joey got here, we all left to TOYS Music Center (which is now just a fucking VENUE) and met up with a bunch of cats that we usually see at gigs and rock out with. I got a few compliments on my attire for the night. It was too hot, though. Brittany drove up looking for me and with her music pouring from the van. Rock n roll, baby. We hung out for a while then went inside and witnessed the Rah Rah's. I think they were pretty good. I don't care much about getting drunk, though. Good punk rock though. ed, kirby and hunter were there. After the rah rah's Told By An Idiot played and they fucking ROCKED. That was some awesome shit. We all messed around outside after that because no one really cared too much about the last two bands....ha. So, Brittany was leaving and Joey's dad was getting there and i was telling brittany goodbye and getting into the rodeo and everything was going by so fast. I""m really glad I got to see Brittany. It made me really happy. We had a nice time together. I love her so much. On the way to Joey's, we talked about all sorts of strange things including people getting hit by trains. We ALWAYS somehow find a way to put DEATH into our conversations on the way to Joey's after a night in laffytown. Well, we all got there, Joey and his dad and will, simon, and I. We ate a shit load of snacks and shit. We kinda jammed a little bit but that was too random and structureless. it was fun nevertheless. We watched Blazing Saddles and played OUIJA. We contacted Pat who was 3. Then, I put on Joey's rosey glasses and layed on his couch while they played daks songs and we all sang them and then i fell asleep. We woke up whtis morning and ate burgers and then i fell back asleep and will left. Joey and simon came into joeys room and woke me up and then joey burned a few cd's of mine and returned them to me finally. He likes them and he's burning me a shit load of cd's for me. he's got a marvelous collection. We came over to my house and we jammed for a while with my dad and then just me and joey. IT rocked finally. Then, i played socom 1 for a little while and we went ride around and to wal-mart and got some things and saw jennifer and shannon and joel. Brittany went to New Orleans today and I'm about to call her. I just need to hurry with this update. I hope she had fun. they went for an occasion that will happen later this week. simon just got killed. he sucks at this game. Wel,, I'm going to catch up for everyone when i update again.

Haha! what a crock. that songs a piece of shit, but i'm glad people enjoy it. AFter we broke down and had everything in the back room, brittany and i went outside for a little while and i talked to martin and jaques. i'm glad they went and saw at least 2 songs off our set. so, we went back in and everyone was sitting and waiting for deadboy to begin. what a great feeling: the deaboy is about to play and we'll all hear the new sound. i was so mellow last night. it was great.... seeing brittany and being with joey and al and everyone else was very pleasing, also. i love nights like that. i really do. brittany and i filmed most of deadboy's set. she did a very good job filming. Thank you brittany! i'm having loads of inspiration flowing through the smoke in my mind. i dont know why, but nights like that and deadboy together just bring everything together. like the planets align and its a full moon(which both didn't happen) and everything just happens and melts together.  everything was beautiful. that last entry of mine was pretty fucked up, but who cares? we're going to play tonight at the pizza pub and i think cory's going to go, too. a lot of people should go..haha i hope they can fit everyone in. haha brittany and joey really rock. fuck yeah. i bought a deadboy shirt and a sticker.

"event","i'll talk about today i guess since i dont remember yesterday except that brittany and i had a disagreement over the fone and all. but it's ok. i'm glad we work things out. she really rocks. we both do. i fixed my computer yesterday too. ok. fuck yesterday. i wanna talk about today. so, i woke up at 7:15 for work and all that bullshit. work was so fucked up because i was so tired. the day went by like a fucking drunk ass dog down mainstreet in breaux bridge. it was so bad i guess. or not so. i called brittany after my cupcakes and pepsi that i had for lunch. we talked for a little while and i got back to work and it was better. i was more awake than earlier and i did more stuff to keep me awake and away from thinking about sleep. i just thought about all kind of other things. when the day was over and i had forgotten what hunter said at work, i got my pepsi and went home. i dont really remember what happend. oh yeah, i called brittany and we talked for another little while and she went with mumsie to blockbuster for some movies, which later tonight she told me which ones. they all seem to be interesting movies. i saw ghost world already and i really like that one. josh was at my house when i got home and he was playing some crash bandicoot game we have. he loves that shit. i havent seen him for over a month. it was cool. adam is in a band with RUSTY QUIRK. amazing. truly amazing. i'm almost speechless. so, i skated to josh's house and tried to kickflip and ollie. what a hoot that was! i wasnt too great or anything, but i left when he and pat went to get pizza. i dont know why the hell that lady was there. she and kim must be married now or something. i came home. i played my guitar a bit. i'm just messing around and trying to get back into writing. it's ok. no, actually it's terrible. i wish i was still writing. i havent been in the mood or have had any inspiration at all lately. it's really awful... it makes me quite depressed, but who's to tell that to? ha! brittany and her rich text. and her rich husband. i played red dead revolver today. i feel so strange and empty this week. i need to see joey and al and brittany and play music. i'll do all that friday and saturday at the same time. beautiful. just so very beautiful. i have 6 days left of work. and i get paid thursday. fuckin a bitch. that's ""fuckin' (ay) bitch,"" not fucking a bitch as in the act of making love to an asshole. and not the orifice. ok, i've gone too far with this. i love a girl a girl who dont love me back-

"event","i went to bed at about 2 am saturday morning and was awoken at 5:15 by the alarm blaring loudly in my face. It was alright though, and i didnt mind one bit. I was going to ride on my dad's harley and be part of the motorcycle escort for Jacob. He's a 9 year old kid who's dying of some weird heart condition. There's this thing called Make a Wish foundation i believe and his wish was to go to disney world and be escorted to the airport by motorcycles. there were about 76 bikes that rode. It was incredible. It really warmed me. I've never seen a kid so happy. I was really happy, too. It was definitely something to experience. It took about 15 minutes to get to lafayette after we got together with timmy. it was a great ride that early. he was even on tv. i bet he's the happiest kid in the world. After we had breakfast at IHOP, they dropped me off at brittany's at about 9:00 and we talked for a few moments and fell asleep. She's cute as hell when she's sleepy like that..haha. so we woke up after about an hour i guess and talked for a while. i believe we got on the computer. i cant remember correctly...and everything else will probably be mixed up, too. i remember things all weird sometimes. We tried to drive brittany's dad's car. couldnt. we ate pizza with mumsie and it was really fucking fun. when we went back home, brittany and i ended up going to gerard park, albertsons, super target, best buy and the world market. we spend ALL of our money except for 9 dollars. you cant get into toys and eat dinner in one night with that. so, we went home and brittany's wonderful mom gave us like 25 dollars and we went to toys and there we waited a few moments trying to get attention cause thats one of brittany's favorite things to do. she rocks it. we then went to sonic for a drink before frames started but came backa few songs into their set. GOD DAMN frames rocks and brittany liked em too. i talked to dallas about a gig together and dave told me dax wants us to open for deadboy friday!!!!! what a great day it was. oh wait. i'm not finished!!! hahahaha!! wooo then me and brittany went to some damn chinese number 9 and the lady couldnt speak english so i guessed what she was saying in chinese. we got it to go and that was pretty damn hard. we ate a good bit at home then went upstairs to rock and burn cds and play speed solitaire. we talked a good bit then i tucked her into bed a couple times and i went to sleep. we woke up at about 9 and left to bring me home. we got donuts on the way and it was sad leaving brittany, but the memory of the weekend was still great. it still is. i had a wonderful weekend. i cant wait till joey and al get their asses back here. summer's eve douches. lovely. i hit my head on the floor at rite aid. condoms cost a lot of money too. who the hell would ever buy that shit!? overall, it was a beautiful weekend. except for all the sleep deprivation involved. peace."

"event","<B>I</B> had a strange day and a lot happened. My mom woke me up at 6 to look at the TV. I tried not to cause i promised brittany i wouldn't.. haha. i went back to sleep, though, and simon woke me up at about 11:20 and told me my old man wants me to cut the grass before the rain comes (the rain didn't come). So, it's about 12 and I'm on the mower and it is <B>HOT</b>. I just cannot believe how damn hot it is, but i didnt mind. I never mind the heat. Probably because we had to deal with it when i played football. i just quit thinking about capitalizing my i's when i say ""i."" it's taking too much, but I like it. haha! So, i cut the grass and was all sweaty and simon almost had a heat stroke in the backyard. I brought the mower to the barn then walked to the shed where the dirtbike is and i took it out for a ride. I hadn't ridden that damn thing for a while anyway, so I just felt like having a little rush, ya know? Right, so I ended up getting the thing muddy and having to really clean it up. After sweating, I took a shower. That damned wheel barrow scraped half my heel off. Damn it. I've got the sweating in the sun blues. After being all cleaned up, I think I took simon for a ride to sonic and we got some shit. The cherry lime-aids arent too great with chocolate in them. I should have gotten the usual. oh well... We did that and drove around Opelousas and whatnot and talked to brittany. After that, we went home. I dont really remember what happened after that...oh yeah, i called Brittany and we talked for a good while and ended up getting online to talk, and we did for a while. I called will to see if he wanted to go to Toys tonight and we could meet with brittany and danielle. He couldn't. As usual, neither his mother nor ronnie wanted to bring us to lafayette. oh well. we'll do something some time.. I talked to joey and al and gianni on the fone last night. they're doin alright and having fun. except blowing 10 bucks at cbgb's. that sucked. fucking bastards over there man. I brought simon to the skating rink and said a few words to cory (nice ones), and then took the long way home so i could listen to the good music on the opelousas radio station. Now, i'm making flip cartoons dance to the jazz i'm listening to on 88.7. I love NPR on Friday's..especially friday nights. that's why it's good not to go out some friday nights...you get to listen to a great radio station. I'm kind of bored and hoping brittany has a good time with her hot hair and her sexy skirt and bad ass shirt and lovely friend danielle. Yeah, they're probably having fun. I hope the guys play a good set. The Movement and FuzzMonky i mean. They rock. haha...that just doesnt seem like a brittany thing to do...a PUNK show. oh well. she's bad ass. she can do that. I'm going to join the dax riggs community i guess. I dont feel like it though. Communities are freaking pointless, you know? Nothing happens. its just like a forum. that's all. a fucking forum. I wonder how our's is going on toldbyanidiot... before i brought simon tonigh, we killed a copperhead that was in the pool skimmer. haha. damn thing. We've had bats, mice, frogs, turtles and snakes and skinks in our pool. I guess they love us. well...all except the snake and the lizards. they all died. and the mice and bats.... they died too. The frogs and turtles live. They're smarter i guess. I really need to stop typing in second grade sentence structure because it's bothering the almighty hell out of me. what a fucking oxymoron. almighty hell. peace."

"event","today was a hell of a day. so much happened and i went through so many god damned emotions i'm so confused. work wasnt that great, and the rest of the day kind of made like rolling hills. it was strange as hell and now i feel so weird. like some modern abstract painting with hundreds of dots and splotches. i dont know where new feelings come from or why they come at all, but this one feels familiar, but new. i cant describe it, but i'm sure someone can because they've definitely felt this before. felt exactly what i feel. had the life that i have. bitch about the same things i bitch about. i still havent told brittany my theory on personalities reacting with other personalities. i really want to tell her, but who really wants to hear something as boring as that shit?? it feels dark.... and deep and slippery. swampy. i hate being green to a feeling, but i also like it. i can explore it. i dont mean just sit here and try to figure out whats going on with it, just let it do what it does and see what happens. i feel about a thousand different things right now. i dont know whatyou'd call it. someone help me out with it, please! i'm very happy with brittany. very very happy. i cant wait to be with her again. i wonder if something new will happen.... feels like death has just begun to loom over my head and watch my thoughts and the energy pulsating through my skeleton. there's still mud in my chest, and i cant get it out. rolling hills keep rolling. i am happy with the relationship brittany and i have together. it's definitely going somewhere. i love that feeling. <B>Going Somewhere</B>. the both of us really rock and get really connected and that's really cool. i just miss doing a few things with her. maybe we'll do some of them saturday. we're definitely doing one of them. i hope her earlobe doesnt close up and she finds her earring. she might have to pierce it agian. bummer. i doubt she'd really mind if she did. i'm so happy for her right now. so damn happy. i called joey and al and gianni in new york tonight. brittany got offline for the second time and i wasnt tired. i should go to bed... but i called and we talked. it was neat, but a few things weren't too cool. i hope they're having better fun than they've been having. i just got a wiff of a cigarette that isnt there. strange. i get that a lot. i'm always smelling something that isnt there. i have the prettiest pictures of brittany on my computer. wow. listen, i need to get to bed before something bad happens. I love brittany more than ever and i'm hoping something will happen this weekend. we're just two emo kids. emo. i'll read the book baby. peace."

"event","well, i went to bed late cause i stayed on the fone with brittany until about 2:45 last night. it rocked baby. work kinda sucked like usual. there was a code red (fire) but they put it out i guess. i think it was in an elevator somwhere. the damn lady took so long to say where it was.... people probably got third degree burns just trying to listen to where it was and they're being burned alive. anyway. that was dumb. 
work was dumb. i was just tired all damn day and people seemed strange. i noticed how when i walk down the hall on the second floor between the ORs and Central Sterile and i unfocus my eyes and look straight ahead, there are little objects around me: to the side, and above and shit.... and when i walk and stare in front of me, they become faces and when one or two pass by me, another one pops up and comes towards me and passes me up. like that screen saver with the stars, ya know? yeah babe, it's like that. i get so tired at work because i'm always doing something. i barely sit down until about a little after 3 when theres not a lot to do and people are going home. i can just sit down and listen to Keisha talk about her sex life and her and Pat bitch about Gloria and Jeanette's bullshit. It's neat to listen to. Ladies rock. Well, they do at least....But DAMN, i'm always walking and standing and moving around and shit. haha i never stop! ok.. 
i got home with nothing to do. i was frustrated and bored. My mom said i could take the car and ride and i asked if i could buy a keyboard at wal-mart because they're like 10 dollars there. woo! so i road around opelousas for a while and used an eighth of the tank. i had my deadboy tape in and the window down and i was feeling so depressed and nostalgic and i felt like dying. i get hot flashes at work. all day. yeah, and i was just really blue when i drove. at least i got to think a lot. i couldnt find a buddy holly cd at walmart. i hate walmart, but we have like no more cd stores besides it and ummmmm.... the ghetto record shop by the chicken place that is across the street from St. Landry Catholic Church. I had my first communion there. i think i was baptised and all that shit there too. brittany just lost the back of her earring. i hope she finds it so she doesnt have to buy some girly earrings she doesnt like. even those are girly. they rock though. i cant stretch my holes. but i really dont care. that shit isnt really important to me. i couldnt care less about my ears being pierced. i want dax riggs's fone number. i'm going to ask for it when i talk to him. al and joey and kristen all left home today. wow. it kinda feels like louisiana is almsot empty. but, brittany is here. and will too. we'll do something. wow. haha. it's so strange. even AL is gone. Al is never gone. ever.  Brittany sent me some beautiful pictures of her and a band and a guy and some of just her. and you know she's gorgeous, so i definitely almost popped in my shorts. she also showed the ugly ones of me. i hate the way i smile. i'm a whale. and i dont mean it in the BIG way baby. That's not rich. no class there. i hate when classy people go and ruin it. fuckuz. i'm working on the picture. kind of. i need to though. i really really needa. that's all i feel like saying right now. peace."

"event","i woke up dragging this morning. i was in slow motion and i didnt feel like waking up are doing a damn thing. i hate going to work now. well, at work it was the usual shit, except some whore came and disconnected brittany and me. i didnt tell her anything. i didnt feel like starting shit with an ignorant, uneducated asshole who is not able to communicate in any form whatsoever. i dont care though, because i called brittany later at about 3:30 and found out i was going to get to see will, kristen, and her in laffytown. that got me pretty stoked. i was all fucking excited and shit for the rest of the time i was at work .
i got home from work and i called will. he said his mom is on her way to my house, so i hurried and showered and all that bullshit and waited a while for her to get to my house. she got there and we rode back to their house and i hung out with will and ronnie for too long and we were a little late to get to laffytown. but it's ok cause brittany was late too. we went in and colored on the paper thing and ordered pizzas. ours was really good. i'd eat it agian. i wish joey would have gone. fuck. i wish i could have seen him today. he and al are leaving tomorrow. i hope they have an incredible time in new york and it rocks. kristen is leaving too. she better have a lot of fun too, and call damnit. 
ok, so after we ate and talked, we left into the parking lot and got into brittany's van and listened to some music and found her simple life 2 cd which i did not steal. we hung out for a while and it was fun. we took pictures and talked and listened to music. great stuff. the moms came and got us and brittany left and i got home to find alex and simon in my room. oh yeah, on the way home will's mom and i had a really good conversation about the medical field and school and stuff. it was cool. she's nice. so, i ate some mashed potatoes and red beans and rice with orange juice, then called brittany and now i'm online. boom. my day. shabam. peace."

today was a hazy day. kinda blury fromnot getting sleep...which will happen again tonight because of brittany! wooooo she rocks. at work,i did stuff. i came home drove to al's and recorded backing vocals on ""Dance, you're manufactured."" that's joey's new punk rock song. it's full of energy and fun to play and listen to. i also recorded snare and tamborine for ""I still have you."" another one of joey's. i didnt have to pay for the fixing of al's acoustic/electric guitar that i dropped yesterday either. it was free. lucky me. al's straps suck terribly. this update is special because it was requested by brittany paige petre, ladies and gentlemen. 
so, the record is almost complete and joey and al are heading out to new york in two days. kristen's going to england the same day. wow. everyone's leaving. but it's ok cause they'll all be back. i hope i can somehow communicate with andre because i miss him and he needs his spot on our album. WOO. come back to us andre. i came home and played some blues kinda stuff with my dad. we had grilled chicken for dinner. he's a good cook. potaters rock. i cant really remember anything. i drew this weird ass picture and listened to brandnew tonight. and i talked to brittany a lot. i'm getting really tired. peace."

"event","well, thursday i layered vocals for friends and photograph at al's house in a few takes. he's finished mixing them by the way. friday...well, friday joey and al picked me up to go to mainstreet to see the movement, spunk, and stands for nothing. FABULOUS BANDS and people. joey, brittany and i walked over to kristen's house where we payed her a quick visit due to her paranoia of her mother waking. it was fun, though. we all moshed (brittany watched). i hit on these girls and asked them for a dance but they declined and i cried on brittany's shoulder for a moment. but i danced like a dancing fool anyway. i believe brittany was humored. i hope. shakin my booty is my thing anyway! bruised, bloody, and broken, we departed the dusty floors and smokey room of mainstreet as tuesday before monday began to play. on the way home there was a great rock and roll line up of songs. this was it: Foxy Lady, House of the Rising Sun, Do You Feel Like I Feel?, and Hard to Handle. I went home and ate a cup of strawberry yogurt and called Brittany and we had a cheery little conversation for the rest of the night. I awoke the next morning to the firey thoughts of spending a day with Brittany (which I did). I rolled out of bed and went around the house getting ready and asking who was bringing me and when and all that crap. I think I woke up at about 10:30. yeah. After I was ready to go, I went outside to see if my dad was ready to bring me to laffytown. he wasn't. he was cleaning the god damn mud of the tires of his bike. i helped him alittle to make it go by faster so we could fucking leave. i put on his helmet. the illegal one. yippee. and he says we might get wet. I didnt really care..oh boy. how stupid. So we're riding this great ride. The wind is really warm and the sun is shining and everything rocks. Then, we go under the clouds and the wind becomes freezing cold and after a while, thousands of little rain drops start attaking my arms and shoulders and chest and legs. That sucked, but it was neat since you dont get to do that in a fucking car. So we're soaked and this old guy on a rickity old bicycle rolls past us at this traffic light and tells us we might get wet. Harumph. So we slowly get to Brittany's house and I go in and my shirt's soaked so she lends me her Taking Back Sunday shirt (which i like) and i was grateful. WE hung around her house playing with jernal and listening to good music and talking for a while. When tami got home, we took the van to get brooke at the mall. brooke tells us she'll ride with will, so we go back home, it takes a little while to get home because people are stupid in laffytown for some reason and wouldnt let brittany turn. we were driving back home and will passes us up. i tell you that was pointless. he didnt needa do that. so we go home and we tell her mom that we're going to bring these people their mail, so we do that and we cant find the house and i call and talk to simon and my dad to find out when i'm going home. we dont find the house. we go back home and hang out there and brittany changes her outfit. brooke smacked me with the damn pillow and laughed her new laugh. brittany made a few lovely comments about it and we left to go to the mall. i know that we went to super target and albertson's and brought the letter back, but i cant remember exactly when those three happened. i know that albertson's happened first cause i got my preferred card!!!! wooooo! and i bought brittany a copy of the MAE cd since hers was not working. its a good record. and we found the house with the letter people. we got to the mall after returning home from halfway there since brittany forgot shoes and we met will in the parking lot and then we parked and walked in to meet kristen near the spot we usually meet at. these two guys came up to me and told me they liked my band, which suprised me, but i acted like an ass according to brittany, but she's right...hahaha. so we walked around the mall a lot then kristen and will left, so brittany and i went see The Notebook. It was a really good movie and it made me sad. I didnt cry like brittany said i would, but that's ok. It was a really good movie. We then went to Sonic and got FOOD!!! chicken. hmph. gooood. cept brittany didnt like hers. so we were driving home and my mom calls her cellfone and i answer for her cause she's driving and all... my mom and dad and simon are at brittany's house waiting for me so i have to hurry and get all my things and give brittany her shirt and lyrics and leave. i left and almost choked on that chicken. teehee. dirty. i got home and called brittany and she went to bed, so i got online and then called joey and we stayed on the fone until about 6:30 this sunday morning. we went to bed and i woke up and called joey thirty minutes later at 2 in the afternoon. i told him to come over to jam so he was here in a jiffy. when he got here, i had set up my drums and talked to brittany for a few moments. wait. did i talk to her? i know i wanted to call her....i cant remember. today was a blur. wow. i'm tired. well, joey gets here and plugs in his guitar, sits down, and we immediately begin to play. it was so awesome. it just rolled on for close to an hour. it was really awesome too. i'm glad we did it. we really connected and everything flowed well. we went to eat at taco bell after i gathered up some change and we ate and talked to frances until she had to clock in at 5. after we ate and talked we left taco bell and headed for park vista because mark and matt are off work on sundays and are usually off somewhere afoot or skating. we finally meet up with them and ian and they hope in the rodeo and we take off to their house. we walk over to the school and they skate and we talk and shit for a good while. we went to al's and i talked to brittany on the way there. we got to al's, i used his bathroom, and we watched POABD's mainstreet performance on vhs. it wasn't anything special,but everyone got their damned kicks. joey brought me home and the others i guess. obviously. and i uh..i dont know. i did something. i think i ate. did i? no....then....stuff. this. i'm talking to brittany on aim. 
this weekend fucking rocked!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

i cant wait till next one. i have work monday through thrusday. i'm giong to be so tired in the morning and all day, but oh well. this weekend was the shit. i loved it. i love everyone. especially simon. 


tune in next week for my weekend update. i may update before that though. peace"

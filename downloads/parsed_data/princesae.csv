"event","<P>I started making patterns a couple of weeks ago, here are two packs completely created in Photoshop. I still have 100+ patterns with different colors. They'll be uploaded in a later time :) ! These can also be considered as icon textures.

<P><FONT color=#999999 size=2><lj-cut text=""Yesterday..""><p align=""justify"">i called 'M' told him about the total expenses, told him if he could help pay the expenses,, he replied and said that he couldn't, said that he can't .... he sounded like he doesn't care at all... Screw him,&nbsp;i dont need him.. ! I don't want anything to do with him, nada.. never !!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999 size=2>I called up 'B' so he could drop me to the Garage, and pick up my car last night.. ! He did, i got my car, paid all expenses which are worth a little over 300 US Dollaers, i didnt care, &nbsp;i was HAPPYYYYY to see my beauty again *takes out a tissue* =P Happy to be able to drive her again,, happy that i got over the 'M' problem, the screw up.. !! &amp; now my life looks better,, i only had problems whenever im with 'M',, financial..etc so yeah, i am happier =) !!</lj-cut></FONT></P>

So i pushed my horn (the beep beep thing on the steering wheel) for like about 4 seconds... then i drove to the other line to be on my way... when i looked inside the car that i pushed the horn&nbsp;at (the beep beep thing), i saw an innocent lady who had such a sweet and innocent face,,.. after that i felt so baaad, felt like i shouldn't have honked the horn at her.. i don't know, i guess most guys will feel that way .. ! Just thought i would mention this littly sad story to you guys lol </lj-cut></FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#666666 size=2>Well, i guess this will be my very first journal post.. and what better to start with other than my rant about my life =) hmmmmm</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#666666 size=2><lj-cut text=""Just so you know my life is full of sh**""> <p align=""justify"">
The last couple of weeks have been really bad, i had college projects due soon, reqests to make which are almost due, and 2 car accidents on my police record which i haven't made... Now, should i talk about those accidents? hmmm HELL YEAH,, it all hapened because of a close friend, lets call him 'M' .. last week he bumped a truck on the edge of the truck and the car he was driving was not his, it was for our other friend which was outside the country, lets call him 'A' .. So 'A' left the car in the care of 'M' but 'M' made that stupid accident which most drivers wont,, because the truck wasn't even moving which 'M' was moving real slow.. stooopid right? Anyway, what makes this thing a big deal is that 'M' has no driving license and he needed the police to write a report about the BUMP so that the car insurance will fix all the damages, So who did 'M' call for the rescue?? MEE !! I wasn't that happy to help because my record was CLEAN, no fines no accidents NADA ... but because he was a friend i had to cover up his mess, so i did.. i gave my license to the police, they wrote in the report that it was 'my' mistake and the insurance company agreed to fix the damages, i was worried at first but calmed down afterwards,, i mean who won't be there to help their friends out? Lets put that aside for now.. !! TODAY, i was driving my car, i picked up my friend 'M' because he needed someone to give him a ride.. after he's done all his work, we picked up another friend 'S' because 'S' wanted to go to the shopping mall to buy some sandles, at this point 'M' begged me, pleaded that he wanted to drive a bit, i was like worried and hesitant.. but at the end he convinced me,, i really can't turn anyone down,, so i told him ""OK, but just for a little while"" .. so while he was driving i was talking to 'S' who was sitting at the back seat, we were chatting.. while chating i noticed 'M' speeding up a bit, so i told him ""Slow Down, we aren't on a high road, just take ur time"" .. then i continued my chat with 'S' and not a minute goes by till i heard him make a loud SIGH, like something was wrong... so i turned around to see that we'll almost hit to the backside of a Taxi,, i told 'M' to Fucking slow down.. then less than a second later we crashed..... The first thing my 'LOYAL' friend told me to do is talk to the police and tell them that I was the one driving,, he ran away and told 'S' to accompany him !! I mean, FUCK.. we just had a fucking accident.. I was the one damaged, It was MY car, what will my mom and dad think about me? I dont speed, i dont play around with my car.. for god's sake i needed the car just to go to college.. !! So i waited there, had no one with me.. so i called my only childhood friend 'B' ... he came right away, calmed me down when i needed it.. Then, the police arrived and wrote the report, obviously the 'culprit' if i may say so, was me, my mistake, because here in my country (dont know if this applies to other) ANYONE who bumps you from the backside is 99% mistaken.. ! So, after the police finished the report, he handed me an accident paper which i will hand to any Garage so i can fix the damages on my car,, the insurance my car has won't cover up my damages,, so all expenses will be paid by my dad... !&nbsp; I called my dad, told him the situation, he got worried, advised 'ME' not to speed, and told me to take the car to the Garage, so i did.. My friend 'B' accompanied me, we took care of everything, and my car will be ready tomorro at night,, it is VERY VERY difficult to get your car repaired this week and have it ready within less than a week, cuz currently we have an important occasion coming this thursday, which is 'Eid' and it is an annual islamic festival which regional countries celebrate, hence everyone will have&nbsp; a holiday.. !! <BR>Well, 'M' called me back, told me he was sorry .. he didnt mean it, and i told him that being sorry isn't enough, i told him that this accident only affected ME, and i wanted him to be responsible in a way, i wanted him to learn a lesson.. so i gave him an option, it is to pay 50% of the car expenses, and be responsible,, OR not give me the cash and be careless.. i don't need his money, my dad gave me the cash to pay the bill... but i wanted 'M' to do something, to learn something... it isn't wrong is it? 'M' is a type of person who always tries to find a way to get out of problems, and YES thats really helpful, but i want to see what kind of a 'Man' or 'person' he is .. ! I've known him for almost 4 years, we've been friends for 3 years.. and losing everything isn't the right choice to do ! <BR>In my eyes, he isn't the same person i knew before,, i think now i've learnt more about him.. this 'learning experience' happens when you observe your friends in a difficult situation, and see what they do,think and feel.... !Right now im tired, just wanted to let something out, it really helps.. ! Well, right now im waiting the response of 'M', waiting to see which option he's chosen.. im really tired, i hate complaining.. i dont mind seeing him being an asshole, but let him be responsible.. or his life will be full of endless problems,,,, i know that he is a good guy somewhere in his heart&nbsp; .. </lj-cut></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#666666 size=2>I have no Lj friends yet, might not receive anything for this post,, but i needed to journal it. You will always need reminders, to help you refrain from repeating the same mistakes over and over again .. ! </FONT></P>

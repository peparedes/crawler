"event","I randomly check things here in Lj-world, and I completely agree with Mars.

""I'm not exactly an adult yet, but I'm going to miss being a kid.
In the future, will I look back at what's going on now and miss it just as much? 
Where, then, is the line drawn between the past and the present?""

Its kinda like the same feeling where you've lived in one place for most of your life, move away, and visit that same place 5 or 10 years down the road. You just stop and wonder how things have changed so much. You realize that you're growing up faster than you want them to. 

Its amazing how much things can change in a year. The last time I updated was when Jackie and I broke up. I've gone through an entire different relationship (which ended), and now I'm dating someone else. I just wish I could pause life, rewind and watch myself over and over. All the stupid things I did, said, and took part in. I miss it all. 

As a young teenager, I was constantly longing to be older -- as I often posted about in early lj.  At this moment, I want to go back to that young, immature, ignorant teenager and enjoy it. I'm going to be 17 this year. Where did the time go? Last I checked, I was 13, hanging out with my best friend Justin across the street at his grandma's. I've got so many memories of that place. And the fact is, she's dead now. She's passed away, and I don't even remember the last time I saw her. 

The human race needs to come up with some sort of time travel."

Roy, and I are starting, not one, but TWO bands. One will be a post-rock project, and another one (ska band!) we will be doing with our good friend Art.
Jackie and I are still good. We celebrated our 14 month Aniv. on the 24 of Feb. (Its getting harder to remember how long its been these days)
School sucks. This correspondence highschool thing is taking forever. It says it should take 3-4 years to finish it, and I have a feeling that it'll take even longer. Bastards.
Soccer season is right around the corner. That means its time to get rid of these rolls, and get some abs! haha 

So there it is. Thats about all I'm doing.

One last thing, 
AQUABATS AT SXSW! Jackie and I are taking Roy with us. Roadtrip!"

Okay, Everyone NEEDS to go out and rent/buy <b>What The BLEEP Do We Know?</b> It is the most incredible movie. Its a scientific movie about Quantum Physics. It helps to prove that there isn't a ""God"", but we are our own <i>Gods</i>. It shows you that we create our own reality. 

Example:

(And when I say ""God,"" I'm talking about the religious view of God. When I say <i>God</i>, I am talking about a higher force in life.) 

A Christian boy is about to go to sleep. He says a few prayers about his family because his mother and father have been arguing lately. He thinks he is praying to ""God."" But what he's really doing, ... I guess you could say praying to himself for help.

What we see in our minds, happens in life. Now I'm not saying if you think to yourself ""I want to find a million dollars in my kitchen"" it will happen. What I <i>am</i> saying is, that when you wake up in the morning, before you remember who you are, before you remember your troubles and pain, ask yourself what you want to know, and sometime during the day, you will understand what you asked about. If it doesn't work, it might be you don't really believe that it will work. It only works if every part of your body believes it will work. The other thing it could be is you need to repeat it a few times. It also works with meditation. Here is a REAL example about what I'm talking about:

My mom was having an argument with her dad about Quantum Physics, but was having a hard time explaining it.
Later that day she went to her room and meditated. While meditating, she thought about how she could explain Quantum Physics to her dad in a better way. She went to Costco that evening, and found this movie. The strange thing is, Costco doesn't usually carry movies like this. The usuall selection of movies at Costco includes the normal big hollywood movies that everyone wants to see. So it was very unusual for them to carry it. 

What happened here, was my mom needed help. She meditated, and thought about a better way to explain Quantum Physics to her dad. She created her reality just by meditating on her problem. It sounds like there is NO way in the world that this could be true, but its 100% true. I can understand if no one believes me on this, but you just have to take my word for it, and try it for yourself.

This movie isn't anti-religious or anything. It just shows that we are our own <i>Gods</i>. I'm not saying that there isn't a higher, smarter force out there. Because there has to be. The world is just too fine tuned not to be. I don't think the higher force is ""God"" sitting on a cloud answering our prayers one by one. 

Now if you read all of this, I thank you. If you actually believe me, or are keeping an open mind about this, I thank you as well. All you have to do is try it. You may have to try it more than once, but try it.

This world is a strange and mysterious place, and we are in control of it.

I start wondering what she could be up to. She comes beack up, and tells me to put my shoes on, and to follow her. She leads me down the stairs and tells me to close my eyes. She lead me outside, and when I opened my eyes, I saw my suprise. She had put tea in wine glasses, two lit candles, and the pizza on her picnic table out back.

"event","Last night, I dreamt that Jackie and I were going to get fast food, and we decided to walk in, but it was really rainy out,and I wasn't that hungry, so I stayed in the car. She walked over to the side of the building and looked into a pit/cellar thing, and moments later jumped into it. She didn't die, but when I had gone over to see if she was okay, she wasn't concious. I ended up talking to her at the hospital, and I remember I was yelling at her and asking her why she wanted to do it, and I was crying at the same time.

After I awoke, my face was moist with tears."

"event","So yeah. Today's Valentines day. I probably won't be doing anything cause Jackie has school/homework. But thats okay, cause we had Valentines early. We hungout over the weekend. I had a really good time. She gave me an engagement ring paper weight and proposed to me, and by proposed, I mean she asked me to be her valentine. She also made me a gigantic card with all this cool stuff on it.

As for me, I gave her a heart-shaped chocolate scented candle, an orange flower, a box of reese's, a box of chocolate roses, and a stuffed monkey that said 'I go ape over you' on his belly.

All in all, it was a great valentines weekend. 

ha

So rate me, (girls)

and rate her, (guys)

then we'll know who's who, and what's what.

"event","Okay, So here is my weekend. It might be kinda long, but I'll put it in an lj cut to make it easier for you. 

Here we go!

<lj-cut>
<b><u>Friday</b></u>
Went to the show at Sams Burger Joint. It was okay. There were a lot of hardcore bands playing. Jackie stayed the night. 

<b><u>Saturday</b></u>
Woke Jackie up, and we watched some TV. She had to jet at about 11 to get home so she could be there when the cable man got there. I did some cleaning around the house. Went to go to the zoo with Jackie, Gaby, and Dani. But decided not to go to the zoo, since it was rainy, and walked around in the river center instead. Spent $9 on candy in the candy shop. Ate at Quizno's and then went to the dollar store. Came home, and watched the Emporer's new Groove at Gaby's. The Went and stayed the night at Justin's. Had a blast with Justin, as always! ;) haha. 

<b><u>Sunday</b></u>
After I woke up, we ate, played Xbox, and skated/Unicycled. Then I had to take off, cause I was going to a movie with Jackie. We went and saw Elektra with her family. The movie was so-so. After the movie, we decided we were hungry. We headed to Wendy's. We got there, and walked in the doors, and as soon as we walk in, Jackie see's Chase's parents. So she gets scared and wants to leave. So we went to Jack in the box. Then Back to Justin's. We got bored, so we headed up to the duck pond to kick/scare ducks. haha. Then dropped everyone off, and Jackie came back to my house where we layed under the stars and talked for about two hours. ;-*

and now I'm here. Oh yeah, and I noticed at the river center, there are people who actualy think I'm hott. I feel cool. ohhhhh yeeeeeeeeaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh.......

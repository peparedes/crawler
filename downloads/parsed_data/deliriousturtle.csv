"event","I went into Georgetown today and the place was unbelievably busy.  I miss home where you could at least always find a place where shopping was a calm experience, and you could find things that cost less than 70 dollars.  I saw the Aristocrats last night--Bob Saget made me cry.  Hearing such a perceived-tobe-wholesome man say such vulgar things was priceless. I was going to say more, but I just dripped ravioli on my chair. So now, off to go clean it up."

"event","Some last minute changes.  I dropped that prehistoric art history class today, so instead I'm taking Sculpture I...which should be interesting considering my lack of experience.  An art for an art at least.  My third roommate never showed up.  I'm really liking the idea of a double at least for the extra space.  Hopefully it'll stay that way, though I guess that sounds kind of bad."

"event","I think this feeling is stress and I don't like it.  It's like every free moment I have there's too many things to be concerned with, and all I want to do is relax and not have to think about the ""future"" that's forcing itself on me.  Anyways, Sheri, you're leaving tomorrow, and of course you will be missed. :) Good luck with things up north. <3

There's this person who isn't talking to me. That really bothers me because I thought he'd always be there. I guess I wore out my welcome, but I still miss our talks.  I wish you'd call me or at least answer."

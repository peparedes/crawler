"event","Hey whats goin ON? Man sorry if I haven't written alot of journals lately it just have been a hard time right at this moment. Alot of stuff has been goin on in my life: I moved to a new city like 20 miles from my hometown and also someone has died in my family and they have been very close to me....so I'm kind of over it but no matter what I will always see his body lying under the ground, six feet away from his family. Ever since I have started writing my journals I have been hiding a secret deep down inside, my uncle was diagnosed with Leuakima and it was getting bad every day and I know that he was going to die from this sickness. I couldn't think that my cousins and my Aunt would n't be without a Father and a husband for as long as I do. It hurts me to say yeah my dad or my father around them becuase its not fair. My cousin is about 5 years younger then me so that makes him only 11 and his sister is only 4( she is about to turn 5 in a little while.) I loved my uncle with my heart so bad nothing would change the way I felt about him. Seeing him laying in his casket was a shock to me and to think that this only happen a month ago. Its feels so like a dream. Everything including  life has moved so fast for me and I can't seem to catcb up with it, next thing I know it I could wake up 30 years old and think what happen to my life. But anyways life other then that situation has been great. I moved to Round Rock, a town that is about 20 mintues where I was raised my whole life. But first let me tell you about my crazy summer before I moved.Right when school was ended, me, Crystal,Natalie, Jasmine, all went to my house toked and went swimming. Summer for me has finally started!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so days and nights went by, smoking and toking all that good stuff. I went to a couple of parties met up with some hotties and life as I know it had just begin.SO I was at some parties toking up with my cousin and this hot guys comes out of nowhere and was like so whats going on? I was screaming over the loud music nothing judt chillin and I'm horny!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAH he begins to laugh and I know that I know this guy somehwhere but it didn't click until my stoned ass thought wait this dark haired blue eyed hittoe is Louis . Man louis is the cutest white guy you just want to love, I would never want to ever forget about louis. I mean we dated for a short time during scholl when his hair was red. But he looked so diffent with his natural hair color but yeah so me and Louis started to make out and he ended coming home and having great drunk and stoned sex!!!!!!!!!! Me and him when on dating for about 3 months until I m0ved and shit but yeah . Then during all those time it was partying, getting fuxed up and getting fuxed. But yeah I moved here and started to go to Round rock High School, which blows but I'm like the true cool classic kind of REBEL guy. So I'm chillin going to school for about 2 months when out of nowhere this Black guy just started talking shit to me. not even knowing me. Calling me fag , queer,pussy, cock sucker. Saying shit that is true but stil I'm not an obvious fag and stuff so I let him talk shit about a month. He was spreading shit about me so you know I approched said dude stop talking mess it will be my fist doing the talking. He was all cool until right when I walked away he called me a pussy so I went up to him and whipped his ass and I got sent to   OC. ANd I'm finally getting out of this place but yeah now I have been getting drunk and just chillin sdo yeah but later!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","The past month and a half have just been insane. I have no idea where to start. I have a million pictures that I would like to post to show you what I mean. But as of right now, I dont have the time. I've become closer to a few people, and find myslef becoming distant with more. That is what scares me. At the end of April/beginning of May, I will post all of my lovely pictures of my escapades. It will include hair dying, europe, concerts, cvs trips, the fair, lots of school, potentially the beach, and everything else. I promise. Just for your amusement. I have been so busy, my head is spinning, but in a god way. These past few days I have been super super sick. I havent eaten since saturday morning and to be honest, I dont care to. I need a shower. I'm feeling a bit better so I'm definately going to school tommorow. To be honest, even if I feel bad I think I'll go to school. A girl can only take so much of lying on the couch watching daytime tv. Life is good and I am content. I love everyone and the world at this point. Check back in a few weeks. Lets hope this elation lasts."

<lj-cut>
So Friday I skipped 5th period. IVE NEVER SKIPPED BEFORE. It was a lot of fun. Probably too much. It was way too easy and I am afraid I am going to do it too often. I only dis it to avoid this scary jamaican dude that keeps hitting on me despite my polite declines and flat out telling him I have a boyfriend (LIE). But anyways, it was funnnnn.

at least its cute.

And last but not least I did comunity service on saturday with Laurel and Allison, even though we didnt do anything but give each other war-paint instead of painting the walls like we were supposed to. And I might have been allergic to it. Ouch.

I havent updated in forever due to the fact that my comouter at home is utterly retarded. I've grown half an inch. Kind of sad because I thought I was done growing. I got a new atv. Very nice. Last night Caitlyn and I watched freddy got fingered, which is quite possibly one of the funniest movies of all time. We are going to shoot of fireworks tonight. The illegal kind that you can only buy in south carolina. As much as I dont like the actual city of miami, I miss the people in it. Well, the ones Im friends with anyway. And Its only been 3 days. I got hit on my a boy. A cute one at that. He was tall with long blonde hair, and heres the best part, HE WASNT WEARING SANDALS!  as you all know, I have a serious foot problem, I dont like feet much, so this was a big plus. And him not being a hillbilly was nice too. But I wont see him again. Which I suppose is good, because I dont want to be in ant kind of romantic relationship right now. It makes things too complex. So yep, I will update when I can. Until then. Stay classy San Diego.

<P>Yeah, thats me and my dad. He's rad. And I suck I rhyming. We play charades when we go scuba diving, he's tought me to drive, and that every other driver on the road is either an idiot or a dumbass. He fixes my shower. He doesnt like me to have boys in my room when the door is closed. He is convinced that I am too good for every guy that I go out with, and that they will break my heart. We cook dinner sometimes together. I know that if I had black hair and a mustache, we'd look exactly alike. He&nbsp;tells me that&nbsp;I dress weird. I&nbsp;tell him that&nbsp;when he was my age, his socks were twice the length of his shorts. He saves me from my mother. We talk. Today, when we were coming back from diving, it started to storm. Not just any storm, a huge lighting storm. And here we were sitting in a 31 foot boat in the middle of the marina with no place to dock. My mom and brothers got off. I stayed on the boat. So me and my dad sat in the rain, thunder, and lightning for an hour and a half. I didnt want him to sit out there alone. So anyways. Thanks Dad. Thanks for being there for me, protecting me, and putting up with my crap. And letting me know that not everyone will be as easygoing as you are.&nbsp; Thanks for treating me like a princess when I was a little girl, and never quite getting out of the habit. Thank you for everything Dad. Thank you and Happy Fathers Day.<BR></P>"

Talked about a lot of things. But anyways, I feel pretty good about the job. And, being that there are only two or three other applicants doesnt hurt either. So my life is pretty calm at the moment. Caitlyn gets back on sunday, Paul comes home I think on friday or saturday, Eric comes home today (he had to stay longer on account of bad weather). In about two weeks, Israel is going upstate for a week. Then in the begining of July, Caitlyn and I are going to North Carolina. Then, for the last few weeks, we are all going to chill.

While in some countries the penalty for driving while intoxicated can be death (yes, death), in Uruguay intoxication is a legal excuse for having an accident while driving. ""Please believe me officer, I really was drunk."" 

The phrase ""raining cats and dogs"" originated in 17th Century England. During heavy downpours of rain, many of these poor animals unfortunately drowned and their bodies would be seen floating in the rain torrents that raced through the streets. The situation gave the appearance that it had literally rained ""cats and dogs"" and led to the current expression.

"event","Summer is officially here. Yesterday, I walked to Israel's house with Paul, Michael, Caitlyn, and Israel. It started to rain so we ended up running, and yes, I fell. So after we crossed South Dixie and I almost got run over TWICE, and a scary truck driver honked a horn at me, we got to Israel's house and watched Star Wars Episode 4. Then we played PS2 and ordered pizza. Around five, Michael left. Six-ish, Paul left. he said that he would go meet us at the falls. So we went to the falls at six thirty. Paul ended up not showing. So Caitlyn, Israel and I went and saw Star Wars Episode 3 : Revenge Of The Sith for the third time. Eric would have come, but he had to pack because he is going to tampa for the week. So I wont see him for a while. So we saw the movie, and these peoplekept telling us to shut up, but oh well. Then I found a wallet. Which, because Im dumb, I turned in. I lost my wallet a week or so ago and I got the wallet back, which was good because I had my liscence in there; but my 30 dollars was missing. So yeah, that whole thing with Karma... so not true. And after the movie, my mom was mad because I ""didnt call her"", which I did. So she wouldnt come pick us up. So Israel's mom came and took us home and he walked me to my door because my house is scary from the outside when you are alone at night. So today, Brandon is at graduation. Yay for the class of '05. Im going to miss you guys! And I have to go to my mom's best friends son's graduation party. And yes, its my punishment. But I'll take one day of torture over a whole summer of grounding.

Now for the lazy people/people who didnt follow:
* Was in a house full of boys with no parental supervision and I didnt do anything slutty
*Got pizza!
*played video games
*went to the falls
*saw Star Wars for a thrid time
*Mom got mad
*Israel took me home
*I have to go to a stupid party with a bunch of people I dont know


Oh yeah, and Israel gets his Liscence August 3rd (Caitlyn's birthday!) So that will be the end of me bumming rides from any parents (even my own) because Israel loves me and promised to drive.  :)"

"event","wow. home sweet home. I hate going on vacation for a whole week with my family. as mean as that sounds, as spoiled as it makes me sound, its just too much closeness. I cant take it. It was a horribly long week, so I'll sum it up for you. Heres the highlights/lowlights/main points.....
* On the plane there, I thought that we were going to crash
* my mom and dad snore LOUD. I couldnt sleep
* after a few days, I had to resort to heavily caffinated tea from Starbucks
* I am now a caffine-addict
* we went to hershey pennsylvania, where they make the chocolate (definately highlight)
* I relized just how much I hate my brothers
* I didnt have my tea, and was in a horrid mood for the whole day
* Next day, I had an emotional breakdown (not from the tea!) I spent half the day locked in the hotel bathroom sobbing uncontrolably
* I was sick that whole week, then it got REALLY bad, I felt so horrid
* On the plane back, there was A LOT of turbulence
* I was sitting in the back, so everybody was running to the bathroom (which was 5 feet away) to blow chunks
* I thought that we were going to crash
* I relized that I want to and have to get over my INSANE fear of flying
* got off the plane 
* retreived my luggage
* came home
* brushed my teeth, washed my face, went to sleep fully dressed

thats it. Today I wake up at 6:30, because I forgot to turn my alarm back on. Im scrabbling looking for something to wear. my suitcase is dumped out on the floor. I couldnt find anything. I finally found what must be the one clean outfit I own. I will have to do laundry today. So anyway, I rush rush rush. Then I go outside in the humidity, and my hair, which i spent 10 minutes of my precious 25 minutes doing, got completely messed up. But it is definately good to be home. See, here, I can lock myself in my room. I only leave for food, the computer, to go to school, and to go out. I have my own connecting bathroom, so thats not a problem. And in the words of Judy Garland, ""There's no place like home."" Love...."

"event","Today was peachy keen. I woke up at Caitlyn's. Then I helped her clean her room then came home. When I got home, I cleaned my fishies (Dr. Frank n Furter and Eric Draven) bowls. Next thing I knew, I was 12:30 and I was not ready for Erin's Party! So I called Alex, she was going to come get me. We ended up being there at 2:30. The party started at 1. We COMPLETELY missed the suprise. But it was ok. We walked up to the beach. We passed Erin and she didnt even reognize us. So, being the girl that I am, jumped on her and gave her a big hug. Then we went to the party (which we had walked right by) and Joe said hi to us. Oh man... did Joe grow up since the last time I saw him. I know that if he reads this, I am going to be SO embarrased. But I also know that I will probably never see him again, and even if I do, what are the odds that he will read this? So anyway, Joe was hot. So me and Alex were kind of outcasts at this party. We only knew Joe, Erin, and each other. I KNEW other people, but they had no idea who I was (dont you hate that?). Everyone was playing on the playground. Then Erin made us come to the beach with her. Me and Alex went in the water while everyone else played volleyball. Then we found Alex's mom and her sister Stephanie. So we hung out with them for a bit. Then we went to have cake. Joe started throwing it. By the end of the ""cake fight"" everyone was completely coved in chocolate cake. Joe said ""I am sooo tasty! who wants to lick the frosting off me?"" hahaha, I did, but I refrained because my heart belongs to someone else (too bad he doesnt care if I'm alive or dead). Then me and Alex hung around there for a while, then went back to her mom and Stephanie. Erin came over to talk to us. I think her mom felt bad that we were alone, off to the side and told Erin to pay attention to us, but whatever. Then we left. Oh and when Joe said goodbye to us, his girlfriend gave us the WORST look. And I know it's a cliche, but oh man, if looks could kill.... I'd be buried already. Like she was jealous of us or something! Come on! She was pretty and thin! I wish I could say the same for myself. All we did was say goodbye! She must have some SERIOUS insecurities. So we left and went to Borders so Alex could pick up a book. We got fries from Burger King, then they dropped me off at home and here I sit. Being that all I've had all day was a bit of french fries and a small piece of chocolate cake, I'm pretty hungry. I also feel VERY gross. I need a shower so bad. I need to wash off all of this greasy sunscreen. Oh yes, and I'm leaving tommorow at nine AM for washington DC. I wont be back until sunday. SO I may or may not get another entry in. My only way of communication is if you send me a text message on my cell phone. SOOO, dont bother calling, I wont pick it up because of the HEAVY roaming charges. So just send a message. I love you all and have a nice spring break."

We went to the fair, then my dad picked us up and we went to outback. We got that big onion thing. MMMMMM. I got Macaroni and Cheese with a side of veggie-tables.

SO heavy! Then we work and set up stupid cones for the stupid kids at stupid pinecrest stupid elementary for their stupid field day. I almost felt bad for them, because I always hated field day. Then I had a *problem* so we went around the school. The we found the empty teachers lounge. HAHAHAHA. It was nice and cold with a big comfy couch. So we went to sleep. Very nice. Blah blah blah, the day went on forver. FINALLY, at 2:20, they let us go. Good thing we got community service. I didnt get a sunburn for nothing! I hope that the coach doesnt tell miss B that me and my dear friend Bella were laying around not helping all day. So then we go and walk to the fruit stand. We got a yummy strawberry milkshake. Then her friend Lindsey and Lizzie picked us up and drove me home. I was sweaty and felt pretty gross, so I took a nice long shower. Now I feel clean. I'm in my pajamas now, so when my hair dries, I'm going to get dressed, straighten my hair, and ride the metro to Vizcaya and go to Cultural Arts night. Then I'm going to come home and go to sleep because all that laying around made me tired. How ironic that laying should make you tired.....

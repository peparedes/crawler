"event","I walk the streets of Japan till I get lost
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
With a graveyard tan carrying a cross
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like studying faces in a parking lot
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like driving backwards in the fog
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything

[Chorus]
The things that I've loved the things that I've lost
The things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't want to learn what I'll need to forget

I like gypsy moths and radio talk
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like gospel music and canned applause
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like colorful clothing in the sun
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I ilke hammering nails and speaking in tongues
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything

[Chorus]
The things that I've loved the things that I've lost
The things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't want to learn what I'll need to forget

Bend and shape me
I love the way you are
Slow and sweetly
Like never before
Calm and sleeping
We won't stir up the past
So descretely
We won't look back

[Chorus]
The things that I've loved the things that I've lost
The things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't want to learn what I'll need to forget

I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars
Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like playing in the sand what's mine is ours
If it doesn't remind me of anything

"event","YOU DON'T SIGN THIS THEN YOU ARE SICK! This is so terrible. A site that we were able to shut last year has returned. We have to try to shut it down again! (www.bonsaikitten.com) A Japanese man in New York breeds and sells kittens that are called BONSAI CATS. That would sound cute, if it weren't kittens that were put in to little bottles after being given a muscle relaxant and then locked up for The rest of their lives! The cats are fed through a straw and have a small tube for their Faces.The skeleton of the cat will take on the form of the bottle as the kitten grows. The cats never get the opportunity to move. They are used as original and exclusive souvenirs. These are the latest trends in New York, China, Indonesia and New Zealand. If you think you can handle it, view www.bonsaikitten.com and have a look at the methods being used to put these little kittens into bottles.

"event","- First Important Lesson - Cleaning Lady.


During my second month of college, our professor


gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student


and had breezed through the questions until I read


the last one:


""What is the first name of the woman who cleans the


school?""


Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the


cleaning woman several times. She was tall,


dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her


name?


I handed in my paper, leaving the last question


blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if


the last question would count toward our quiz grade.


""Absolutely,"" said the professor. ""In your careers,


you will meet many people. All are significant. They


deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is


smile and say ""hello.""


I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her


name was Dorothy.


2. - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain


One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American


woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway


trying to endure a lashing rainstorm. Her car had


broken down and she desperately needed a ride.


Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car.


A young white man stopped to help her, generally


unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s. The man


took her to safety, helped her get assistance and


put her into a taxicab.


She seemed t o be in a big hurry, but wrote down his


address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a


knock came on the man's door. To his surprise, a


giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A


special note was attached..


It read:


""Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway


the other night. The rain drenched not only my


clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along.


Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying


husband's bedside just before he passed away... God


bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving


others.""


Sincerely,


Mrs. Nat King Cole.


3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those


who serve.



In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less,


a 10-year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and


sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in


front of him.


""How much is an ice cream sundae?"" he asked.


""Fifty cents,"" replied the waitress.


The little boy pulled is hand out of his pocket and


studied the coins in it.


""Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?"" he


inquired.


By now more people were waiting for a table and the


waitress was growing impatient.


""Thirty-five cents,"" she brusquely replied.


The little boy again counted his coins.


""I'll have the plain ice cream,"" he said.


The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on


the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice


cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress


came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the


table. There, placed neatly beside the empty dish,


was one quarter, two dimes and five pennies.


You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had


to have enough left to leave her a tip.


4 - Fourth Important Lesson. - The obstacle in Our


Path.


In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a


roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if


anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the


king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by


and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the


King for not keeping the roads clear, but none did


anything about getting the stone out of the way.


Then a peasant came along carrying a load of


vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the


peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the


stone to the side of the road. After much pushing


and straining, he finally succeeded. After the


peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed


a purse lying in the road where the boulder had


been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note


from the King indicating that the gold was for the


person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The


peasant learned what many of us never understand!


Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve


our condition.


5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts...


Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a


hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who


was suffering from a rare & serious disease. Her only


chance of recovery appeared to be a blood


transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had


miraculously survived the same disease and had


developed the antibodies needed to combat the


illness. The doctor explained the situation to her


little brother, and asked the little boy if he would


be willing to give his blood to his sister.


I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a


deep breath and saying, ""Yes I'll do it if it will


save her."" As the transfusion progressed, he lay in


bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did,


seeing the color returning to her cheek. Then his


face grew pale and his smile faded.


He looked up at the doctor and asked with a


trembling voice, ""Will I start to die right away"".


Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the


doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his


sister all of his blood in order to save her.


Now you have 2 choices.


1. Delete this email, or


2. Forward it to people you care about.


I hope that you will choose No. 2 and remember.


Most importantly.................. ""Work like you


don't need the money, love like you've never been


hurt, and dance like you do when nobody's watching.""


NOW more than ever - Peace...Pay It Forward

ummmm... yea! new process to talk to someone without having to actually talk to them. write a note to them then store it in an empty shoe box! woohoo! problem solved! i get my feelings out and no one gets hurt! woohoooo!! lol, yea i know that i will have to face my problems eventually but i cant afford to do it now so i will wait till i have the time/the effort/the energy lol. sad i know.

wow the river rox at this time of night. punk up the volume i think.

i just took a shower and i feel GREAT, lol. im good now. how was everyones weekend? ive been having freaky dreams. they probably dont mean anything but yea just kinda wierd. i slept aaaallll day aferschool on friday bc i just needed to crash, then i woke up at 3:45 and i look at the clock, say screw it, then go back to bed till 8:45. so yea sat consisted of really nothing besides talking to friends on aim and doing homework and drawing pictures on a cirtan tpoic then when i look at the kick ass final product... it looks nothing like the guidelines on what it is supposed to be lol. but idc. sunday i went to church... and... then i did hw but my mom went into my room and drained me so thats when i started the box system and then i went to youthgroup and corrected the newbs incharge about some native american history. hells yes i know my history! and so yea then i spent the rest of the time moving boards, making one of thoes old-fashion pilgrim things where theres a board and 3 holes for your head and hands... and yea then i went on a ladder and hired monkies (little people, like 7-9th graders, who cant control a pencil) to make a mark as i measured where they should mark for holes to be put eyes in so we coul hang stuff. but as i do not have three hands, they had to mark it and they did a pretty bad job but oh well. after all the eyes were put in i had to erase all the marks and i got around to doing three and i just got too tired so i said, ""hey, who wants to play a fun game of climb up the ladder and erase the pencil marks?"" suprizingly like 4 kids sais ""oooh ooh oooh oohh!!! pick me!! pick me!!"" so i just said ""here you go (i toss them the eraser and get off the ladder), go crazy"" and sat down till i went home and took a shower. and now im writing a boring summary of my weekend, lol. i pity and sympathize with the person who actually reads this. i heart you *hugs*

im sad about halloween though... my mom wont let me go trick or treating this year... just because my punishment ends the DAY AFTER HALLOWEEN... so i just want to curl up on the couch and have a friday the 13th marathon and also watch the freddy movies. then to top it all, freddy vs jason! lol my mom and step dad will probably be at a halloween party and my sis will probably be trick or treating with her friends so i will be incharge of being in the big manshion with the candy bowl... and the big... dark windows... in the middle of the forest... in nowhere elkhorn *dun dun dun* *enter creepy music* 

creepy!!!!! 0.0

also james really wants to see ""the corps bride"" with me (its wierd he insists on it... dot dot dot) and he wants to go to vallas pumpkin patch with me so im gonna have to set something up on one of my dads weekends so i can do that for him cause my mom is a biotch and wont budge for anything. but she will be in vegas starting wednesday! score!!!! so yea... annas gonna take advantage of this limited freedon presented to her.

so yea... i heart you all!!! have a great night and yea.... lol thats sabout it. love you lots and ttyl"

lol okay that last one was from me. mwahahahahahaha. so yea. my ear is on fire!!!!!! and i officially <3 fans!!!!!!! and uhh... so yea going to the football game at the highschool on friday and i encourage everyone to come bc it will be a hell of alot of fun. im currently mad at one of my friends... -_- but thats another story and im pretending its alright with us but making sure to pull james closer to me. 

ummm... okay fan is getting cold... im going to put a hoodie on...

okay back...

okay this is a pointless entry... so yea... what have i been thinking about lately... mainly someone in the past... they say time heals all wounds well i think that if the wounds are left open, time can only make it get worse.

""Love is like a tree in the four seasons of change. It can either bloom and blossom into a warm, loving relationship, or it can slowly turn, fade, and die, and grow unbearably bitter and cold.""

good quote... but yea... other than that ragging on and maiming my mind... im good. im getting more and more attached to james... which might or might not be a bad thing... depends on which scenerio is running through my mind. 

my dads car broke down in colorado. lol he was planning to leave a day early and it turns out hes two days late. so im going to be at my dads house starting to morrow and on through the weekend. that = more freedom for anna + annas car at her dads house = even more fun. 

my laborday weekend SUCKED ASS... well i guess i have had worse weekends but NEVER at the ozarks man... i used to love that place and love going there but this weekend completely killed that. thanx to my stepfather. i was beginning to get to know the fake john then as soon as we are driving back to omaha on monday night he says ""you have been rude to me for four years, dont start again."" COMPLETELY unpravoked. fucking fucker... but thats not what killed my weekend. i had been dreding it since the minute i found out john was going. and my mom told me at the perfect time. the day before we were leaving on thursday. i throw a fit...  -_- whatever. mistake # 1) turns out that i drank out of michaels gatorade and so did katie. lol and katie was trying to get me purposely sick so i wouldnt have to go (my idea really lol) and katie had or has strep. now friday i wake up fine. when we get to the ozarks mistake #2) i go tubing for hours at a time while john drives the boat like a fucking maniack and i completely strech out my arms and tricepts and i bash my brused up shit on the side of the boat. also my back and uhh... frontal places were pained because of the tube going over waves and wakes of other boats. i now realize that i have more arm strength that i thought i had... but yea thats off topic (now heres where these mistakes fuck up my weekend) 

we decide that after we go tubing we start to shop. i complain about feeling woozy. john says im over reacting and mom ignores the tension in the car. i then get a fever. a fever that includes a red throat that lasts till saturday and stops sunday but i woke up on sunday with PAIN STARTING FROM MY TOES TO MY HEAD. (not an exageration, i swear) so this pain continues on still now. but now i have gotten able to move and the pain has subsided ALOT! but i stil cant get over the fact that john wouldnt give up the death jokes and keep on making fun of me when i was feeling cruddy, fucked up, messed up and torn up. i asked him to stop but he didnt... fucker... dude i could barely get up on saturday...

wow.. anna seems like shes using big words... yay! lol but yea.. that was my weekend. and i would have been anywhere but there. my paradise.

yes i will admit it.. i did have some fun... hahahaha i scared the crap outta john when i was driving the boat. there was a speed boat that passed me and i said ""show off"" john heard me and said ""well then speed up and pass him"" so what do i do? put the boat in full throttle of course!! hahahaha. i slowed down after a little bit. i mainly just wanted the after effect on johns face. muahaha... i can be unpredictable!  and i did get kool stuff from the ozarks... and there was times where john seemed to be not evil... but he hurt teddy... :'( and i just wont like going there again... just no the same safe haven that i knew ever since i was a child... its been tainted with bad memories now...

lol ""enter katie's, anna's being emo, comment here"" i love you katie! hope you like the monkey.

lol dude i look sooo hott with this. and i ALMOST NEVER call myself hott.

soooooooooooooooooooo.... i have more stuff to type... i just dont think that i will type it... aahh fuck that. 

james~ what am i going to do? im getting VERY attached to him. earlier i couldnt care less if we broke up... but now... i really dont want him to leave me... he ... cares for me... and says he loves me. i know i could never be truly in love with him... hes not my true love... but i feel safe with him. and he cried to me. and i dont want my friend stealing him away. and i dont want these worries in my head to get in the way. ahhh fuck too late. i do love him. i really do. and i dont want him to leave. i want him to stay and have him arms around me. or start playing with me while im doing homework (you perv's i mean teasing me like messing with my pen or poking me or messing with my laptop) i have a connection with him i havent had with anyone. its like... we can talk about stuff but we dont... like we dont have to. and he never gest mad. i used to get angry with that... and i kinda am still ticked that he dosent show much emotion... but now i know he atleased has them... and that he can come to me if he needs to talk or something. meh... i have more to say/put my thoughts into words but i cant think of it right now... so yea...

""him""~ not gonna bother you with all the typing i would have to do to vent about him... i'll just do that in a private entry

katie- im kool with her. i <3 her.

lex- things are getting better. i <3 her too

sarah- unusually... im getting used to her. and now im not pretending to like her. shes okay i guess.

michael- lol hes getting himself into a world of trouble. but hes great. i <3 him

and everyone else is kool. i <3 you julie!!!! i <3 you caitlin and our wierd conversations lately!!!!!!! lol

so... wow... i needed/still need to talk... yay. for all of you who actually read this a) i sympathize with you b) i thank you for your paintence/ bordom and c) you need a life!! or stop avoiding homework you dorks!!!! i love yas.

"event","""Miles Apart""
by Yellowcard
----------------

IF I could I would do all of this again,
Travel back in time with you to where this all began, 
We could hide inside ourselves and leave the world behind, 
Make believe there's something left to find.

We'll be miles apart,
I'll keep you deep inside,
You're always in my heart.
A new life to start,
I might be leaving,
But you're always in my heart.

Now we've all grown up gone on and moved away,
Nothing I can do about it,
Nothing I can say,
To bring us back to where we were,
When life was not this hard,
Looking back it all just seems so far,
So far away.

We'll be miles apart,
I'll keep you deep inside,
You're always in my heart,
A new life to start,
I may be leaving,
But you're always in my heart.

Give it up for just one more day with you,
Give it up for just one more day,
I'd give it up for just one more day with you,

I'd give it up for justone more day with you,
Give it up for just one more day,
Give it up for just one more day with you.

I'd give it up for just one more day with you,
Give it up give it all away,
I'd give it up for just one more day with you."

and to katie, im SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sorry!!!!!!!!!! it was part medication and part me wanting to not have it lingering over my head for a while. the real me inside wanted to do it and instead of holding it in which i would have done the drugs made me go for it. not worries though. im not mad at anyone, just a lil ticked at james...

AND HE DIDNT BRING MY TUB OF ICE CREAM!!!!! ... meany...

so yea... im not going to go over the gross details over my lj bc some ppl would be grossed out so if you wanna hear how my 1st day went the e-mail me or talk to me, k? 

michael told me that day 3 would be the best...

my cheeks hurt... and the right side of my mouth. bleh!

""im so sorry, i heard about the bad news today, a croud of people around you. telling you its okay, and everything happens for a reason...""

ouch... okay now i feel the pain...

so... yea... maybe i AM responsable for the death of humanity. i mean hey. i didnt know what i was doing. i though that it would all work out and everyone would be happy. lexi would get over jackass, michael would have someone to make him happy, i would feel happy because maybe, JUST MAYBE, he would give her that smile back that i havent seen in YEARS. but NO! ITS THE END OF THE WORLD. I FUCKED UP EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING. and my expression to a person who acts like that. ""its the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine..."" well that was just my mood to that person. i realy feel horrible. i have know her since the 5th grade but it seems like they tell me i have been oblivious to everything. okay okay i will admit it that i do have a tendance to ""hide myself from humanity"" on some weekends but hey. who dosent want to be alone some of the time? 

what ever... ""ive done some pretty mean stuff before""

im a horrible daughter. spening too much time with my friends... and nto enough with my dad. my mom... wont get started on that. and john... i have stopped trying.

horrible girlfriend... 

horrible friend.

i hate dumping on myself and being all like ""aah woe is me i dont deserve this life i dont deserve to live i have been a bad person. bad anna. bad anna."" but this is what i hear so... aaaaaaaahhh... *sigh*

so yea... was happy. VERY HAPPY POINT ENDED IN LIKE 5 MIN. hahaha. hope they got what they wanted. i could care less though. im just in a fucked up mood... 

cause ive been gone for a long time waiting on the sidelines hoping for a chance to play. well i though that i would never leave anything behind. i also never though i'd say...

well... noth the journal entry i was planning to put up. wanted a kinda. ""im so happy. everything is great"" kinda feel to it. but ah well... this is my mood right now. bye bye."

this is pretty sick but it was makin fun of those chain letters that u die from if u dont pass them on...so i had to pass this one on....

Sexyma43254:hey, i'll give you a scat job if you let me in

buFfdUDe1818:what, who are you?
Sexyma43254:My name is Samantha Clit, and this is Mike Hurff, right?

buFfdUDe1818:Yeah, I am eating spaghetti

Sexyma43254:Oh, well i think your hot and i want to see you tonight.

buFfdUDe1818:I don't even know you

Sexyma43254:but i know you

buFfdUDe1818:oh...well you aren't going to sneek through my window then bladerape me, then skin me alive, then hang my remains, then eat them are you?

Sexyma43254:Oh...no...well...no...just make sure you sleep in your little brothers room and go to the window when you hear a knock...and don't have a weapon near you.

buFfdUDe1818:Alright...ill make sure im just in boxers and im as vulnerable as possible.

Sexyma43254:Oh, and make sure your brother is vulnerable too...and dont wake him up if you are disturbed by anything.

buFfdUDe1818:Alright.


That night, Mike went into his brother's room and slept with him(occasionaly rubbing his genitalia against his brother's soft and velvety anus). But he awoke due to a tap at a window that a preverted/psychotic girl could fit through. He got up and leaned foward while putting his hands behind his back and walked to the window....he opened the window and leaned over the sill as far as he could to see if anyone was there...nothing...just some branches and a squirrel. He turned around and saw his brother bleeding through his ears and mouth...Mike went to check it out...but when he got there he realized his brother had stopped breathing! He then saw a hand coming out of his closet door. He didn't think twice about not telling his parents or grabbing a weapon. instead he decided to be smart and go open the closet door. And suprisingly there was a sick girl there...she stood 4'11 and had no mouth. her eyes were baby blue and she had blood soaked brown hair. Then she grabbed mike by the neck...threw him on the ground and bladeraped him, then skinned him alive, hung his remains and ate them.

PART 2

The next day the boys little sister Megan who was only 5 went into her little brothers room only to find them both dead. She screamed and her parents ran in....they were devestated and cried for 3 days straight...they died from water loss and the little girl was left parentless...so she went and lived with a foster home...she went on her new families computer and got an IM....

YoIminHell69:Hey lil sis

Heyimurlilsis1314:Hoo is dis?

YoIminHell69:its your brother.

Heyimurlilsis1314:I dont have a brother

YoIminHell69:yes you do, you have two...remember we were just
killed a few days ago.

Heyimurlilsis1314:no...i don't...
YoIminHell69:...

Heyimurlilsis1314:wait, yes i do.

YoIminHell69:good good

Heyimurlilsis1314:wait, aren't you dead?

YoIminHell69:yeah, hell has computers

Heyimurlilsis1314:but why are you in hell?

YoIminHell69:i kinda touched my lil bro that night...but thats not the point.

Heyimurlilsis1314:oh so what do you want?

YoIminHell69:well i need you to go kill anyone who doesnt pass on my murder story after they read it.

Heyimurlilsis1314:okay...i'll do that...i have infinite transportation to everywhere in america and some parts of europe.

YoIminHell69:umm...it'd work better if you killed yourself...then you could run around everywhere murdering people who dont pass on this chain letter and the government would NEVER get involved with the mysterious deaths stemming from passed on internet stories.

Heyimurlilsis1314:So you want me to enforce those chainletters that take up all the space on blog sites like myspace,livejournal,xanga and all other email systems.

YoIminHell69:yeah...that would be sweet....im sure when you die you will get an instant psychic connection to everyone's computer and know who read what, when.

Heyimurlilsis1314:oh, yeah, i probably will...awesome...ill go kill myself now.

Later that night the girl killed herself and became an all powerful and almost omnipresent being...Megan now spends her days bladeraping,skinning,hanging,and eating people who don't pass on this chain letter."

my mom is acting wierd... shes acting... ""motherly"" and johns never around anymore (personal spirit lifter) but idk... its like shes her old self but theres still that hatred that i have for half of her that john converted to have my caring mother posessed by demons.

"event","i havent vented in a really long while. i have succeeded in changing something in my personality to help the better of the people surrounding me. woot woot.... -_- well now its hell time and i think that its time for a healthy venting session before i blow up inside.

I HATE HUMANITY. MOST OF THE PEOPLE I COME IN CONTACT WITH ARE WORTHLESS EXCUSES FOR A WASTE OF A MORANIC LIFE.

~Topics~

i didnt even really know the kid~ yea we are aquantences but really i didnt know anything abotu him and it would shock me a lil yes abotu this deal but what really pisses me off is the fact that he did this to lex. this is jsut nfjdsahfgsgjdfsagfksafvn sad ufdsfhjsad fhjkdsa hfkjsdfh jksdhfjklasdhfjkdsancvuidfnc vufdvnusadn vkldsafjkdsa fhdkjsfh sadfh dsafh dsah fkjdsah dkshfjkdsahfjklasnc jkdsudanui nfiu... hahahaha i wrote ""sad"" completely on accident............. but yea that pissed me off... and the fact that i cant do anything to help her or to find him just get me pised more. and we are growing apart badly enough and its just like... idk what to do... idk what i could have done to prevent things like this and idk what to do if alexis and i do grow apart... like she said friends grow apart everyday. so what if the only reason shes still with me is bc she feels obligated... i told her i loved her... w/e ....

""The faster we're falling, 
We're stopping and stalling.
We're running in circles again""

person who's in your head~ is it a crime to not have a certian person in your head? is it a crime to not be in love with anyone when you are 16 but still love people more than the world itself? is it a crime not to feel the same way abotu someone.... i mean really can you really balme the person for not going against what they feel just to make your life easier? 

""A secret is just an unfinished conversation with yourself.""

secrets~ i have no secrets. you know what you know about me and if you want to know something i have told another person. okay yea i have secrets like what i keep from my parents but hey dont get on my case about that what teenager tells there parents EVERYTHING about thier lives. if you dont know shit abotu my life its because you never asked or nothing brought up the topic of what you dont know. not my fault. but no... everythings my fault.

i finnally gotten into my head~ and cleared it out. and now... reading old journal entries... reading emo shit that i have written as songs/ poems and even friends venting... then my jackass step father ADMITING that we want eachother dead... that was a real tear jerker... not to mention i wanted to hit something or anything sooo badly... 

""dyingheights267: cross over to the sands of time...let the hate flow into your mind...the poison needles of the pain...stab into your every vein..the blackness the swells from the inside...just like a veil that shrouds your eyes...the blinding earth shattering darkness consumes you...there is no hope...we linger on in a world of pieces...stopping only to break them more""

idk theres more venting somewhere i have just gotten so used to hiding it i think its lost lol.

i am fine though... dont feel safe with anyone. bf never talks. people are suffering bc of me. parents are stressed and dont see anything wrong with me cept the usual. out in my own lil world. yup... everything is normal.

ttyl and sorry if anything was offending in anyway"

... im really bored... and it feels wierd when you think of things when you are bored... like everyone has dissapeared from me... like no one is there, no one cares and no one can figure out thier own problems. and when they talk about thier problems to you, it tales your mind off of yours but that just means you need someone to suffer in order for you to have a break from your life... 

idk if that even made sense! lol

<3 you all and i will be in solitude for the next 4-5 days. (a.k.a. i will be at the ozarks and they don thave internet there so yea it is hell in my childhood heaven bc my mom and step ppls are going to be there *enter in sarcastic woot* ah well.)

love you all. more to say. nothing to express it. therefore theres nothing worth speaking about. 

yea... i really am emo...

"event","There was a boy who I liked and his name was Dave. He liked me to,well thats what I was told...but one day I was walking to class and I heard someone call my name when I turned around Dave was there...

""Ashley wait up!"" he called.

I waited for a few seconds and let him catch up then once he did I started walking again.

""Yes,you need something?""I asked
""Yea...a favor.""he said.
""Sure what is it?""I asked.
""Go out with me."" he said with a gleam in his eyes.
""ok...sure.""I said secretly jumping with joy in my mind.

He walked me to class and kissed me good bye...then the late bell rang and he sprung down the hall to get to class. He walked me to class every day and Kissed me every day and he was with me every chance he got. Then days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months and months turned into a year and he still ran to catch up with me. It was the day of our one year anniversary and he walked me to class gave me a box and a kiss...then he whispered into my ear...""I love you."" then he left. I opened the gift and it was a ring...a gorgeous ring. That night we were out at dinner to celebrate and all he surprised me...AGAIN...

""Ash...you know how I said that I loved you?""he asked
""yea?"" I got really nervous....
""I really do you know I love you.""

I didnt say any thing and I knew he wanted me to say it but I didnt want to seem stupid so I stuffed food in my mouth and he didnt say anything but I could tell he was disapointed. We got done eating and he was driving me home at the red light he turned and looked at me...

""Why wont you say you love me? dont you love me like I love you?"" he asked,

I didnt know what to say I loved him more than I could imagine but I just didnt know how or when to say it...

""I...I...lov....""

BOOM!!!!!!!!!! a semi had hit the driver side and rammed us right into a lake.The next day I was in the hospital and all I could think about was if Dave was ok...so I got out of my bed and searched for him...but when I found him he was barly alive...seeing the one I loved near death made me drop to my knees and cry...

""Dave I love you...I've loved you since the first day we met I love you soooo much dont you leave me please dont leave me I need you here...I LOVE YOU!!!!""

With his very last breath he said...

""Ash...I love you too."" then he was gone.

A week later I was able to go home but I wasnt ready to face school yet and my mom understood. I went up to my room and I found a note inside the ring box....

Ashley,
I hope you like this ring. It was my grandma's she told me to give it to the one I love and well I love you. No matter what happens to me I will always love you. If I died today I want to die knowing you love me...I wont leave this earth with out knowing you love me. Ashley your always in my heart forever until the day I die.
Dave.

p.s.
I love you now...I will love you forever.

REPOST THIS IF YOU NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO KNOW IF THE ONE YOU LOVED...LOVED YOU TOO...OR IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE SOOO MUCH YOU WOULD DIE WITH OUT THEM."

"event","One night a guy & a girl were driving home from the movies. The boy sensed there was something wrong because of the painful silence they shared between them that night. The girl then asked the boy to pull over because she wanted to talk. She told him that her feelings had changed & that it was time to move on. A silent tear slid down his cheek as he slowly reached into his pocket & passed her a folded note. At that moment, a drunk driver was speeding down that very same street. He swerved right into the drivers seat, killing the boy. Mieraculously, the girl survived. Remembering the note, she pulled it out & read it. ""Without your love, I would die.""

"event","I told my friend to write a poem about me because he was bored and asked for something to do, this is what he came up with~

 she stands in broken glass, 
her eyes reflecting the pain she once saw, 
her hurt and hate reflects into her eyes, 
projecting their horrific past into the hearts of the ones she watches, 
she stands in a state of confusion, 
her heart full of the pain she once knew, 
her mind in strife, 
trying to debate her true feelings, 
full of glee, 
or lost in a memory, 
her life a becomes a blur, 
as she trys to hold onto what's important to her.

so yeah... today consisted of haulling stuff on the 4x4 like fallen tree's, limbs, leaves i had to rake and stumps i had to get up, out of the ground with chains and the 4x4. woopie! i have got cuts and scrapes (hahaha i think im getting another scar on my hand) but other than that im fine,  just soar and sad that i could be out with James and friends at the battle of the bands or at his friends party.

my mom is having a party for my aunt and grandmother's birthday tomorrow all day. woohoo! hanging out with homophobic rich kids!! though they play halo 2 most of the time or megan (the model 12 year old) talks on the phone with her friends. i dont mind. i usually am on my laptop. i like talking to jeff though. hes the only cousin i have close to my age and we are 9 months apart(he is older).

well im going to take a quick shower bc i feel dirty. (and not the bad way the mud way)

went to the mall with alexis tonight... 5 min into the mall we find julie and daniel... then chris walks bye with his friend orion. lol i look at him and he walks bye and comes back saying ""do i know you?"" i laugh and say yea i have met you twice and the last time i saw you was at this mall. i introduce them to chris and he introduces orion to us and we just all hung out. chris got me kicked out of ""bath and body works"" lol but orion but his bottle on my lower back and asked if it was cold then chris was like ooh back off thoes three you can go after but not this one. lol thanx chris.

chris and i (the co-founders) took everyone to the secret spot shhhhhhhh!!

then we went through the mall more and there was this fortune teller... she says that i am creative and need to chase my dreams... i just need to tell someone everything honestly. lucky numbers are 2 and 10 and i will have romance at the end of the month and as long as i am true to my feelings... everything will work its self out."

in Dreams. Day-dreamer, creative and forever lost<br>in thoughts. You're a
dreamer, wanting more in your life than you have<br>now. Though you a lot of your
dreams never seem to leave your own mind. You've<br>created your own little world
inside that head of yours and you're most beautiful<br>when your mind is in
the clouds with sparkles in your eyes. You'd rather<br>be asleep than awake and
people find it hard to have long conversations with<br>you as you mind often
wanders and you aren't a big fan of reality. You<br>are long and almost child-like
probably with a great love for Fantasy or Science<br>Fiction. You're very creative
and most likely love to write wonderful stories or<br>draw and even sing, anything
creative that you can use that vast imagination of<br>yours. You're a bit of a
puzzle to people love to wonder as to what is going<br>in your mind.</p>

ouch...

well i found out that this friday i am getting my 5 wisdom teeth pulled (yes i ONLY have five) and that night i will be coughing up blood. so in other words if i dont die when im under because of the meds, i will die choking up on the blood that got into my lungs... and i have 4 days to recover adn then back to school... im going... to be... in pain... and i hate shots and they are giving me an IV *shivers* ... im to old to use the maks to breath the meds. i think that im gonna get a note from the doctor and my mom saying that i can refuse to talk bc my jaw is gonna kill too. no phone calls just aim and a notebook.

today i am going to my grandfathers house!! yay!! not the rich one but the fishing one (i like that side of the family better anyways). cant wait to have his fish! omg he cooks the greatests fish and french fries EVER!! hes slowly dying of throught cancer (he smokes) so im gonna try to spend as much time with him as possible.

i had got a few questions about my last lj post... yea sorry bout that... people were annoying the hell outta me and broke me down.. i wrote that when i was angry then by the end i was crying... remember tony? he had a drug problem... weed... idk i just miss him sometimes... its wierd that i find out more about him after he is dead.

only one more week of being grounded. yay-ness. tonight is prom for the juniors and seniors. *pouts* i wanna go!! ah well...

ttyl ppl

""Believe me 'cause now's the time to try
Don't wait, the chance will pass you by
Time's up to figure it out
You can't say it's too late

Seems like everything we knew
Turned out were never even true
Don't trust, things will never change
You must be dreaming"""

Ummmm. Today less work outside but more inside.

They are going to look at my wisdom teeth today to decide when they are to pull them! aaahahahaha.... thank god my mom said yes to putting me under for this. They think that they are gonna pull all four of them then the two that arnt supposed to be there. YES i have 6 wisdom teeth and YES IT SUCKS ASS!!! The appointment is at three ish.

Micheal and James might ""suprize"" me today with some company so i will get to see them for like 10 min but other than that its just me and sami till school. Grace and John are forming a bond... im not gonna get in the middle of this but while hes all ""buddy buddy"" and acknowleding her, hes still ignoring me and shooting death glares... whatever im not gonna get into this. My mom and i saw a movie last night with the digital cable ""Something's Gotta Give"" i can sum it up in one wordish~ awwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!! its soooo cute and really funny.

Because Alexis says that i never post anything that is saying anything *coughnotamistakecough* heres something that is bugging me... 

a) ted and i are on a ""break""... says to call him on next monday if i REALLY need him... *sigh* ... 
b) ppl don't really care
c) i have been getting better at writing music but they are all hatred or emo
d) ummmm.... yea just felt like a ""d""
e) why arnt there ""e""'s in the grading scale?
f) i have been ruining ppl lately... great... and yet you still say that life is worth living when you hurt the ones you love without meaning to. 

Yes Alexis i DONT KNOW! Please just accept that for now... i'm sorry...

Swedish proverb~ 

fear less, hope more;
eat less, chew more;
whine less, breath more;
talk less, say more;
love more, and all good things will be yours!

yay... love my heritage tho... 

Everyone has been drinking more... like drinking drunk more... idk theres lost of whiskey and beer lying around and i have never tried it... idk just a curiosity.

Other than that today i am gonna be messing with the internet and ummm thats it.

Thats sad because I actually could see that happening. AAAHHHH! lol

Happy Easter everyone!!

I have been at my dads house like for the whole week. I hadn't seen him for two tho. First we were out of town then he went out f town.

My Easter memories are so joyful! =3 . Easter egg hunting at my old house, my sister and I waiting in the house impatently for my parents to hide the easter eggs and candy in the back yard, going to my grandparents house or a family reunion thing at an uncle or aunts house... old videos of my sister and I... and my mom... can't really remember my dad being there... till the whole divorce and shared custody thing happen. Now with holidays its every other holiday with every other parent.

Attention to Katie!!!- I love you to death!!!!!!!!! Remember when Tony died and you were there to confort me? I don't know what I would do without you babe for a thousand reasons you have been there for me and changed me and made me happy and have influenced my life! Yes Tony's death WAS A MISTAKE! Don't make his! Babe... I knew him like 1/16 of how much I know you. I knew him like for a year and have known you since the 7th grade... I don't just know about you Katie, I actually know you. Katie... okay heres a quote that explains it perfectly. ""Immature love says, I love you because I need you. Mature love says that I need you because I love you."" 

I don't know what the hell happened but sure as hell I'll kill them if anything happens to you. If you give yourself a bruise then they get more cuts than they can handel. If you get a cut they gets a limp. You knock yourself out well, they gets the same ammount knocked unconsious cept we get to kidnap them and beat the shit outta them so when they wakes up they doesnt know where the fuck they and what the fuck is going on. lol. Pour sand down his throat then salt on his cuts... but yeah I'm the sweet one. lol

Babe... you just dont know how much you mean to me. You just need to realize that there are people that really care about you.

Well I have to go my cousins are over with my aunt and my grandparents. 

I have made a ""myspace"" but I'll update on this one more, I think. lol Something to kill my bordom. 

Much love to all!!! 

ttyl

oooh! My cousins gf just gave me a present!!!! A soft bunny and some other stuff!! I got a chocolate bunny from my dad... and when I came home friday... mom had put four Easter eggs in the ""key box"" and a note attached... ""Two for Anna and two for Grace. I love you! - Mom"""

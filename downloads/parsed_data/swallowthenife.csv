"event","ya know how somedays everythings just pessimistic and you completley hate you life...you feel shitty as hell then you see that one person and you couldnt be happier. being around nick makes me the most optimistic person in the world. the happiest. the luckiest. even when everything goes wrong, it couldnt be more perfect. its soo mushy gushy. but true. sometimes you just have to look at the whole picture and be greatful for what ya have and who your with. yeah nicks further away for like a year and a half...but if ya think about it. thats nothing. thats a lil tiny dent in a lifetime together, so its not that big of a deal. (or at least as much as i made it seem in my last lj...) its <b>definatly</b> worth it. and even though i regret posting all that in there, at least we got to talk about it so he could know how i felt and its not just bottled up emotions...but still it was harsh...and way overdramatic. i love nick. i dont think that there will ever be a day that i dont. welp peace out."

(bad) anywho. not much is new. today was eventful. school pissed me off alot...stupid. i have alot of stuff to make up and study for. all while goin to work everyday but monday and thursday. then there was that whole fight thing in the parking lot which made me realise alot of things about life. it was depressing. and im extreamly weak-idk just a pussy i guess...and then i worked and that was usual...came home all bitchy and hungry. and apparently everyones been fighting all night. the whole threatining of divorce has resurfaced. but ill belive it when it happens. just all the work and school and drama and buisiness of december has just been getting to me. i actually have a boyfriend to spend it with and ya think i'd be happy to not be alone like always...and dont get me wrong im greatful and all and i love him, just theres always gona be something wrong. and i can only blame myself for having such high expectations or for being optimistic to often. well im goin to catch some shut eye so i can go to Nicks match tomorrow. night."

"event","just bored...sundays are kinda depressing. Life is so funny....when i finally do something i thought i wanted to do for a long time. everything just gets really fucked up. and for the first time ever im scared of whats gona happen. i really miss when things were all perfect. i changed everything to have it one way, and now i dont want to be like that anymore...but its too late for regrets now. i've already ruined my life as i know it. i had EVERYTHING. now i think everyone would be happier if i was gone. im so deeply sorry for everything i did. ill never be able to make it up, but i hope some day you can forgive me....Im fucking everything i've always hated.....

"event","hey guys. its monday...yeah. i know the majority of my friends dont really like nick right now. and think im stupid for goin back to him, and maybe i am. but its the only way i can be happy, and eat. and i love him, that too. but i can understand why yous all are kinda meh about it. cuz you saw how upset i was when we did break up, and i focused on all the bad things at the time and shit. but hes a really awesome guy, and i think it took some things like breaking up and Friday night for me to really notice that. most people would see him as just your everyday jock and such, but hes different. hes not shallow, and more mature or something.i dont know why i decided to write im just bored. anywhoo im off like a dress on prom night. heh. i love stealing lines."

"event","""My Happy Ending""

So much for my happy ending
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

<b>Let's talk this over</b>
It's not like we're dead
<i>Was it something I did?
Was it something You said?</i>
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high 
On such a breakable thread

<b>You were all the things I thought I knew</b>
And I thought we could be


<u>You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending</u>
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

<i>You've got your <u>dumb</u> friends</i>
I know what they say
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they
But <i>they don't know me</i>
Do they even know you?
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be


It's nice to know that you were there
<b>Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one</b>
It's nice to know <i>we had it all</i>
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done


Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
So much for my happy ending

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh..."

"event","Well, it's my final day, and tomorrow I complete the journey out of hell...Charlotte will be great, I can't wait to get there, all my bros, all my friends at Queens college, and anyone else whom I might have left out.
The day shall be full of boxes and tape, with a little music going in the background to keep me motivated...or maybe just some Cowboy Bebop goin on the TV, either way, I've still gotta pack, which sucks!
Tonight and later today will be filled with goodbyes to all of my friends here. It'll be the last night at Matts house...and we're close to the end of Suikoden, hopefully we'll be able to finish it before I leave...cause then there will be so many people without voices!!! Sgt. Joe, Lilly, Sisqo, the frenchmen, and the singing troops...aah the memories.
I will actually miss some people from here in Fayettenam. Adam, Matt, John, Kenny, Daniel, Laura, Tanya, Sarah(even though she doesn't talk!!!), David, Nick(bitches come!), Norma, Orlando, Opi3, Justin, Robbie, Jennifer(that sober girl from the party that one time), Hooker (lil hooker, and his sister ::drools::), Borg, Slimmy, Will, Tink, Cap'n, and anyone else I may have left out...
So for now, that's it, and I think this is my longest entry yet..."

"event","Today was better than others have been this week. I wound up running a service call for Franco, which may not have been the best choice, but, I got some free stuff out of it, and good news on the gaming front, I'm back up and running with my sweet new video card, mobo, processor, and RAM. Freelancer servers beware, here comes Heero. Oh, and I got to talk to Rachel, which is always nice ;)"

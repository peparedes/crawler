"event","<FONT size=2>this was a pretty great weekend. i spend it with jordan and his family at this nice rv park (oxymoron..ya moron) in thier bus that they just bought. me lace and jordan slept in the livingroom i guess and not like i dont like snugglin with lacey or anything but i couldnt sleep knowing that he was RIIGHT there and i couldnt touch him. his parents are kinda sketch on the physical contact thing and his dads not down with the word love. i guess it doesnt bother me much but i dont know.. i am really ready to be done with school but my grades are crap so what i really need is another&nbsp;5 weeks of school to get them up. jazy ive been going to this girl for accupuncture and shes awsome give me a call and ill give you her number. the treatments havnt been working yet but she said it will take some time.. and oh yes much more money. well its back to fear factor for this pathetic little blonde girl.</FONT>"

"event","<FONT size=1>my brother is finally back in town. he got a 2 week leave from the fort in delonega, so were thrilled to have him home. we went out to dinner the night he got in, and the fam is going the the pads game tonight. my mom got killer seats and im pretty stoked to see the new park. my other boy jordan has been with me every second i can manage, its awsome. he picked me up this morning pretty early and we went back to his house and we slept for like an hour.. soo nice, i definitly dont think school is more important that that, no matter what he says. ill most likely be there after school untill i have&nbsp;to go home for the game. i give it a week before he's locking his doors and closing the shades when i come over. no one can spend this much time with me and still think im cool...</FONT>"

"event","<P>wow i had the best weekend ever. i was with jordan pretty much the whole time and i loved it.&nbsp;we went up to john wayne airport to pick up tommy with matt and came back and went to the wok place next to souplantation.. cant remember the name but it was really good. we ended up watching a car show at jordans for an hour or so and then we went to brendens morp bday party which was chill. jordan and i didnt stay for long tho,&nbsp;we headed out to run some ""errands"" and then we had to drive up to ontario at 12 to get his other friend who got a shitty flight. ive never been so happy just&nbsp;sitting in a car for and hour and a half driving in the dark. so tommy was the first to pass out with his shoes on&nbsp;i guess but no one really fucked with him. after we picked everyone up from brendens we went home and i had to be super sneaky to not let jordans mama know i was there. i slept in the space between his wall and bed right underneither little who i was afraid would either roll or step on me. i got up when his parents went to church and he drove me home. my mom thought i was at brookes spending the night.. little does she know... im such a bad kid, lol. on sunday i showered and went back over there at like 2 to swim and ended up staying till 8. i cant stand to think hes going back on sunday.. i love this whole him being only 10 mins away thing. well tomorrow night is our big game vs. LCC at torrey pines i found out at 6. we are gonna do so well, everyones pumped to win this whole thing. GO POWAY! lol..wierd</P>"

"event","<FONT size=2>so yesterday was quite the day... found out stucky cheated on me with this freshman named rachel meyer and FUCKING ERIN LILLY, can we say dirty? so i pretty much have a death list that needs shortening. i went to ask him about it b.c id like to know what the hell he was thinking but on my way to his house i got a flat tire... so i had to call him to come change it b.c i was late for soccer. after he was done i asked him and he lied to my face which was shitty. and to top it all off we ran so much at practice. blah! today was better however, james took me to school cuz i didnt have a car and he ditched and brought me a slurpee at lunch. i went tanning after school and boxed with james for like an hour before practice. not too hard of a practice tonight, we hit all the pole vaulters behind the goal with our ""shanked"" shots. i was contemplating shooting one into the back of coach shithole's head but i thought it may be to obvious. plus jordan comes home in 2 days... soo excited to see him. so its been a wierd few days, but i am still alive.</FONT>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#000099 size=2>so i had a pretty boring day today, and i think im getting sick as much as id like to deny it. i realize that my grandma and my mom are bitches when it comes to dissing on my other relatives, it was interesting to listen to them ill admit. however lacking in social entertainment i did a good deal of sitting which i probably needed. the whole insomnia thing has been taking its effect on my body, also the fact im missing something or rather someone terribly. five more days until hes home though. on a happier note sean and em are back together! i think it was the best decision, b.c adam and alex probably had a good hand in the breakup. i know sean feels alot for that girl, and as he should shes pretty amazing if i do say so myself. all this love in the air... kinda makes me sick, lol, im just angry cuz mines so far away. wow so i have a fat cavity in my back tooth, damn sees and thier 1lb. boxes... they should come with wrning lables or something, ""do not eat if depressed, may cause extreme bloating and high dentist bills"". so we got seeded fourth in CIF playoffs, which is only b.c in our shitty pre season we lost to granit hills and bonita vista. this means we'll play torrey most likely this friday. hopefully we'll be able to score some goals this time.</FONT></P>"

"event","well we won league last night, the team anyways... i played for a huuge two minute time span, it was impacting on the game i assure you. we still had a run this morning at 8:30, gotta love our coach. i spent the rest of the day sleeping untill about 3 when i went to the MC game. they won and i saw bonnie do the exact thing i did at last nights game... sit n shag. im not bitter, nooo... i seem to have developed insomnia or as i seem to have discovered im too bored to sleep. oh well late night mtv and comedy central are my new best friends. i had a great night tonight tho. i realized that poway may just be more boring than valley center. 50 first dates is something that i would recomend, its a good laugh. i spent a good deal of the night loitering in the shaggin wagon in front of In n Out. and to top it all off i got to talk to jordan who i suspect was a little less sober than he normaly is at 3 in the morning. a definitly good night for me."

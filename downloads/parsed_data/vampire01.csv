"event","hey i havent written in a long time because i havent been on much and i just havent had the time.
well the other night kel and i went to a party, where all everyone did was get drunk and high. jarrod cheated on sasha with some other slut. kerri's boyfriend had phone sex with aaron's ex, jessica got dead drunk and had sex with another guy, making her cheating on cameron. tom almost raped jade. the night was so hectic, it was fun but it got too freaky for me, so i left. kelly stayed and i dont know why. im kind of scared that she might have cheated on me. i mean i trust her but everyone was doing something, weather it was sleeping with someone or something. i love her alot and im worried, even though i asked her and she said nothing happened. 
bye for now."

And now it's like I dont do anything with my mates. Only Luke. Luke has been there for me for a long time. He's been my mate since preschool. 
I picked up Nat the other day from school. Her ex (she dumped her b/f last friday ) is a bloody skin head! Lmao. He looks so bloody funny without hair. Thank god she dumped him before that! Lmao.

"event","*Hugs Jamie* Aw Jamie. I Won't join a gang. I told them last night. But something good and bad happened.
I met them last night and I told them my decision. They started insulting me and saying things like I must think I'm too good for them. I tried explaining that it wasn't my style. They tried ganging up on me, and one even pulled out a knife. A security  guard came before they could do anything so I ran off. I ran over to this little park in the darkness just a couple 100 meters away. I thought I was alone but a girl was there. About two years younger than me. She asked me what was wrong and I told her. She was really nice. She was sexually assaulted earlier that night and so me and her talked for awhile. She was pretty cool.
She gave me her phone number and then we took a walk. I drove her home then went back to my place. I g2g, Bye."

Before he could do anything one of his mates came up to me and started talking to me. He said I had a wicked attitude and asked me to be in his gang.
I said I'd think about it. We're gonna met tonight, so I can see what it's like. It's so wicked.
I'm out.

I feel like everyone is against me. I duno why I even write in this. Not that anyone gives a shit anyway.

I..Dont want to tell anyone...but I guess I should. It would be rude not to....so..here what happened.
Just came home from Amy's. Her parents said she was in her room. *Sigh* So...I went in there. Ya know what I found?
Amy and Mark on her bed kissing. Passionately. They didn't realize until Mark say me and sat up. Amy was surprised. *Growl* OMG.
It was horrible. I was so mad. I could have broken his neck. I could of yelled at Amy. I walked out, too angry and upset to hear Amy and her shouts of 'sorries.' I cant believe it. I trusted both of them. Oh god.
*Sigh*
I feel used...and dumped...I'm taking the phone off the hook...so no one can call....and I dont have to hear any of their voices.
Look this is too weird for me to do right now.

"event","Well I'm pissed. I went with Amy down the street, which was fun. And we saw a couple mates and chatted to them, then I got criticized by Mark that I didn't spend enough time with Amy. And then I got shit from Eric (16 yr ol brother) about Amy and me. I swear I was almost about to break his neck. Then when I got online, Jamie was upset at me for being two hours late. *Sigh* I can't do anything right in anyone's eyes. I always do something fucking wrong. I always screw something up. And now Eric is going to have another bloody sleepover with his mates, and they'll want to use my flat around the back. Natalie is being annoying and moody. My mother is crabby and my dad is shitty with everyone. What a great bloody life. Ok, now I'm just complaining. Later."

Pity there is no cousins on my mother's side my age. Only a fifteen year old, but that's not near my age. *Looks around* I feel kinda lonely. Amy's doing something with her family and Mark is away for Easter holidays. So I basically got no one do to stuff with except Dad and watching footy. Oh well. I'll just enjoy my Easter break. *Smirks* And daydream about Amy. Amy Amy Amy...lol. Ok enough day dreaming.

Oh well, anyways I went out to my uncle's to lay some fencing down on his block of land. Then we took a look at the horses. I'm thinking about being a part owner or trainer. *grins* My dad was part owner of a horse once, he raced in Darwin (capital city of N.T., Australia) and won The Darwin Cup.
Kingston Reserve they called him. He was a great horse. Recently he broke his leg and had to be put down. My father and uncles were upset, as they loved him. Oh well, see if I have any luck with the next one.

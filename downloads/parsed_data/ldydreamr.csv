"event","I've made a decision in my life that is going to change my life, my direction.  It's time to let go. I'm going to start looking for an apartment for the boys and I.  The house is to much to take care of, the weeks the boys aren't here, it's empty and too big.

It's time to let go, to place the memories in the locket of my mind and move on .. move forward. It's time to reclaim my life and the direction it's taking. 

There are a lot of memories in this house ... sharing life with Kerry, watching the boys grow up, even the struggles we all had are memories to treasure because the helped each of us grow. I'm thankful for what Kerry gave to me during his life with me, and even in his death, he teaches me forgiveness and acceptance.

I have no idea what tomorrow brings, new adventures, new people, smiles, tears, and I want it all.  I want to learn to give myself again, to trust in the deepest way possible.  To build dreams, share life, to grow together in partnership and grow for ourselves, within ourselvves too.

Learning about yourself, it's hard work.  At times I learn things about myself I don't want to know, other times I'm fearful of venturing because of being afraid either I'll have more self acceptance to make or want to rebel.  I learned something this past week.  One reason I've been having a hard time the past few months is I've been fighting accepting me as me.  I'm not a casual play partner, to play with whomever, I want more. I want to feel safe with the person emotionally, to know my emotional being matters and will be taken care of. To me, casual encounters don't do that.  I also know it takes me time to trust someone.  Time brings that trust as does communication.

After Kerry and I split .. I had one goal, one main focus .. that was to gain women friendships, gain a support system, friends, to be able to give myself and share in their lives.  I'm proud of myself in overcoming some of my fears in reaching out for those friendships. Exposing myself, my vulnerabilities, giving myself, sharing me.  

""Trust myself"" ... words told to me by a very close friend.  He's so right ... security, trust, respect for yourself, within yourself is vital. It's a challenge to do sometimes.  So many times I've been brushed off or laughed at for expressing my feelings. It takes courage to try to do that again .. but I am trying and will keep on trying"

"event","It's been a few days since I've written.  Many thoughts, ideas, dreams, trying to make sense of something that probably isn't intended on making sense.

I've been very fortunate to have people in my life that have given so much of themselves, just by being themselves, at times I know I lack showing appreciation for them. There are others that are a part of my life that I know ""take"", that at times I feel drained, and I'm learning to refuel better than I use to.

The house feels quiet, I'm feeling quiet inside. I miss being held, touched. I miss sharing the little things in life, the laughter, the challenges, the just sharing. Taking the steps to get out of the house, make friends, enjoy my life, at times is a challenging step.  Sometimes I feel like I should be doing more.  Meeting people within the lifestyle is great.  There is a downfall to it though which I am frustrated with. Finding someon to ""play"" with is actually pretty easy, it's finding someone that wants more than play that is the hard part.

For me, right now in my life, getting laid isn't a focus, it never has been.  I know that in my life, casual sex has never been part of my nature. Sometimes I feel like I'm the odd man out, that there is something wrong with me not being footloose and fancy free to just enjoy things in life for the pure pleasure of their enjoyment. Sometimes I do try and go there, and something always seems to happen where I question why I did.

Remembering being told that sex isn't love and love isn't sex. In some ways that fits in the lifestyle too.  Just because someone wants to scene with you, you have a good scene, doesn't mean anything more than things were good for that moment.

I want to be more than a slave to someone, more than their submissive.  I want the whole thing, to be their slave, submissive, and woman. I want to share life, build dreams, have fun, stay committed to working things out for the long haul.  Sometimes it feels like so much focus / talk is on the lifestyle, on D/s, etc., that the concept of relationship as a whole gets put aside. 

My thoughts are scattered, dreams of what I would like to have in my life, how life is, how far I've come and knowing there is still so much for me to learn.  Learning to ask for that help, that is one of the hard parts. Remembering so many times when I've asked for help in some form or another only to be shot down, brushed off, so I try and figure it out for myself.

My goal today, to stay up beat, focus on my work, keep watching what I eat and drink a lot of water, stay away from the coffee.  Think positive, give myself a break, and try and learn not to be so hard on myself"

"event","A good weekend, productive, relaxing, fun. My boys came home on Friday.  We spent Saturday moving their things to the new bedroom so they're together again for the first time in 8 years.  They seem content.  It was neat for me too sitting on one's bed with the two of them there. My boys, together, the three of us, a family. The dog on the floor boppin' his tail against the bed. Life is good.

While at the hardware store on Sunday, bought four new clamps. I don't think I'll ever go through there without seeing something that might be of use for play.  When I go back, wanting to get one of those plastic rods, similar to the one on blinds, they're flexible, stiff at the same time, I can only imagine how it would feel.

The hedges in the front yard, now trimmed, still needs work.  I don't have the tools I wish I had to do things around the house, the yard, so I make do with what I have. Hot tub cleaned, refilled and I'll start heating that up again.

""B"" called last night.  We talked for a while about life things, my weekend, working in the yard, the clamps, hot tub.  He suggested I buy some ivy or start growing some ivy to make a privacy screen on the deck for when we play outside. We talked about the dog, how max is having problems with his hips and what my alternatives are. I hate the thought of having to put the dog down, he's family. At the same time, it's not fair to him to have to live in pain either, I don't have the money to 'fix' him, and even that kind of fix won't eliminate the pain and his difficulty walking.  As we both said, a day at a time.

""B"" is a good friend, an important man in my life. I would be lying if I didn't say I wish he could be here more, that I wish he was local. At the same time, I knew what he did for a living before getting involved with him.  We're friends, lovers, we share something special between us. In sharing what we do, he's helped me gain strength inside myself to be me, to grow, and always feeding that desire to learn.

Time to be mom, get my son up and get the show on the road here"

"event","Life is interesting in so many ways. So many changes have crossed my path the past two years alone. From my relationship with Kerry, once collared by him years ago. Both of us learning that in D/s, that wasn't where we belonged together. Trying to make life work without either of us being true to who and what we are.  He's dominant, I'm submissive, together, our needs, wants, strengths and weaknesses didn't blend.  He needed my strength, my direction. He needed a security in me that he couldn't find in himself. After he died a few months after he moved out, grateful for the opportunity to remove the BDSM things from his apartment, I saw no reason for his family to know of his lifestyle, for their memory of him to be altered to what they believed. If I could give anything back to him, let them remember him in a way they understood, in the safety of what they could find peace with. After his death, things returned, he still kept my collar, leather, three rings, worn from constant wear during those two years, I was proud to wear his collar.

Since then, I've learned the pleasure in pain, of being true to yourself, listening to how my body responds when I listen to my spirit, and even learning how it reacts when I don't. So much of my journey has been alone, while my life has been touched by several, the saying ""still waters run deep"" is so true. Someone once asked me why I always seem to choose the hardest path, the most challenging one .. and all I can respond with is, while most if not all are, those lessons worth learning the most, those are the hard ones, and they stay with you for a lifetime.

I am a masochist. Why I am this way I don't know.  Sometimes rather than trying to figure out the why, accepting and embracing that part of me is the path that feels right. Feeling the bite of a cane brought swiftly against my skin, the burn of a cherry, the white pain from a needle, the crisp searing wallop of a leather belt .. they sooth me, soften me, and give me strength at the same time. It's hard to describe where I go, what it does, even the simplest things, being bound, blindfolded, giving the strenth of my spirit to one that makes it soar, it's profoundly simple in some ways, as well as complex in others.

I've had different people tell me of humility, of being humble, for what I am given, what I am taught and what I learn. I am pleased being able to share my life with my friends, and to be a part of their lives. I am proud of the paths I've taken, the growth I've done. I'm proud to be submissive, to be me. Even though I may not have made the wisest choices at times, I do learn by them.

Feeling centered, calm. My mind open and receptive to what tomorrow may bring, focusing on flexibility, calmness"

"event","It was a good day today. I got into work a little late as I took some time checking my email, responding to some of the posts. One of the emails reminded me of something a friend and I were discussing the other day.  How like other aspects of our lives, our lives that are integrated within BDSM also ebb and flow. There will always be parties, munches and other events, what is important, is not to lose sight of those things I value, trust, truth, honesty, integrity, sincerity, faith to name a few.  I try hard stay open soul and mind, it's not always easy, nor is it easy to be willing to stand alone.  This is one of the things I've learned of myself the past 6 months, more than any other time, that there is a time for things to happen. 

I'm almost finished with the New Bottoming Book. It's the third time I've read it.  I'm gaining some different insight this time around than I did before. In some ways absorbing it deeper, having a better understanding, more of a tangible shape in a way. Getting a better mind's eye view of how things work in the aspect of fantasies and making some of them come to life. There are the physical fantasies that are pleasurable, fun and very erotic, and hand in hand with that is the mental and emotional responsibility one has to themselves. While ""nilla', some fantasies were or should have been left to fantasy, whereas in this lifestyle, the envelope is pushed, edges are touched, and with the trust and security in and with the one you're playing with, those edges aren't as sharp.

Drove up to the Transitions munch tonight. I enjoyed the drive up and it was great to see so many people.  Great company, warm souls and like minds. I am going to start checking the munches locally more.  Try and make a trip to Oregon and go to their munch and meet some friends there.

I'm really looking forward to spring, sunshine, warm weather.  To get out and work in the yard, to go on some very much wanted and needed road trips. To continue to grow, explore and have fun in the process. I know it's not all about fun, there is some hard work in there, in the end, it's about being happy with who and what I am, where my life is and where I want it to go.

Its getting late and I'm sleepy. Feeling more relaxed tonight, peaceful, centered, ca"

"event","This is my first entry here.  In some ways not knowing what to write, and then knowing there is much I do want to write.

I had the pleasure of sharing the company of K and R on Sunday at the Citadel. I always enjoy seeing them both.  There is so much to learn from others, and I do learn from R.  I admire her comfort and freedom of self in the lifestyle, her energy and spunk.  I admire her strength in being able to be open and communicate so freely with her dom.

On Sunday, K put me in a rope harness, first time I was in one. My tits bound, feeling very secure,like I was being cradled. Once he was done, I was very securely bound and I could feel myself drifting. After a while sitting was a problem, so I opted to stand, I wasn't in pain, uncomfortable in some ways, yes, just absorbed the sensations. When he started removing the ropes, I found myself slipping into subspace, each time he had me turn, the deeper I went, when all the rope was removed, I was flying, feeling serene, peaceful, pliable, he had me lean over a table and used several floggers.  Some hard, some not so hard ... feeling the single tail on my ass, I loved it.  He reached between my legs and started touching my clit and I came instantly.  I was surprised, in some ways startled, I gushed, feeling cum down my legs, I hadn't had that happen before.  I felt like when he told me to cum, my whole body opened up and flowed, thats all there was, all of me open, flowing, flying. I do appreciate him taking the time to play with me, use his toys and energy, giving me the pain I was craving so much, that I needed. 

Sometimes I don't know if I show my appreciation enough or in ways that others know I'm sincere. Sometimes when I try and explain something I use the wrong words. At times I don't understand my being a masochist.  Loving the pain, where it takes me, how it balances me and helps me come to center.  Sometimes I fear becoming a pain slut, of coming to depend on that pain to become centered. Its a catalyst in many ways, it softens me, strengthens me.

I'm starting to ramble so I'm going to scoot to work"

"event","well me and jordan were ditching school (of course) and we had a breakthrough, we were just talking the whole time. but heres what we came to, fuck seth, (the other kid in our gang of three(me jordan and seth)), and drugs a mind controlling devices which suck balls, ytes even fucking cigarettes and beer, which i love both. basically i already set one thing down before the talk today, drugs suck because they control youre life, and everyone thinks its good for you. but you LOSE your life because pretty soon all you know what to do is just fucking smoke weed or do some kind of drugs, because you have no other fucking life, you just do drugs constantly, you have NOTHIGN  better to do, just go get fucking stoned all the time and waste your life away without doing anything. and what me and jordan realized,it happened when i was talking to jordan about when i hung out weith the kids from RMSEL, and then i listened to why they dont do drugs, it was because instead of doing drugs and throwing parties, they just go to someones house for a good laugh. now i respect that more than anything!! now the kids in aurora, all they know what to do is fucking get stoned, they dont know how to have fun without drugs, and that fucking PISSES me off, i fucking hate it. people are too obsessed with drugs to know whats going on, or even know whats fun. the only thing they got going is drugs and thats all they can think about, they dont know a life without drugs, its fucking pathetic, i cannot stress to you how much drugs fucking suck, i almost thought of quitting everything. and plus me and jordan realized this when thinking of seth as well, because he thinks hes going to be kool by doing drugs, and if people are forcing him to do drugs just so they can think hes kool than i think that is one of the most fucked up things in the world. i fucking hate drugs. there are only some good things about drugs, but they bring veeerrry bad consequences, like in the 50's people knew how to have fun without drugs, they may have had alcohgol every once in a while. but they still knew how to have fun, i respect people like that, fuck drugs"

2) BE YOURSELF

My second resolution is coming true. Because Max came over today and we did all our old songs and everything!! I fucking loved it. And also we came up with three new songs. But on one of them its an easy beat but CONFUSING as hell. So I mess up from time to time. And Max is going to take the tape home tonight and take a look at it. And also during band practice my fucking hi-hat broke!! But I fixed it, but right now I'm still not too sure of it. So I'll check it up later.. Well that's all."

"event","well, today was tiring as FUCK, i left RMSEL at about 9:30, because i didnt want to be there and i had homework to do, but it was at home, so there started my adeventure. It took about five hours and its was 11.3 miles long. It was crazy, at first i left Rmsel and started heading out of Denver, and just before i reached Aurora, i went under a bridge and had a cigarette. And soon when i reached Aurora, i had realized this was too far of a walk, but i kept going. Pretty soon, i was approaching the highway, but before i got there, i stopped at a ski and snowboard rental shop. I had lunch there, and remembered i had my friend's camera with me, so i watched some good memories. And then i left for the highway, but to the entrance to the highway, i had encountered a bride i have ALWYS wanted to explore. And so i walked up the concrete hill, only to discover a bum's residence. I saw a couple of forty's there, and a couple packs of cigarettes (all emtpy of course). And then i walked a little farther up the ravine to find i was on top of the bridge, it was crazy! I saw the whole city from where i stood, boy i wish i would have been there at night. It would have been beautiful. Then i finally got on the highway, it was dreadful, i was stuck in the middle of all of it, i had to cross several times, it was crazy, but then i remembered that there was a national park nearby, so i headed towards that. But when I got there i had found fences and railing, so for about the next two miles i had walked along the rails... But then i had finally reched what i recognized as ""town"". I was so happy, the next stop  know was smoky hill high school, i knew id find someone there. I was so tired as i approached the school, i didnt want to walk anymore, but i kept going as usual. And then i saw a friend of mine there, i was kind of happy to see her, and she had not seen me in a long time. We said hello and had light conversation. And then i walked a little further to albertsons, i knew i was 15 minutes until home. And so i walked from there and here i am, yeah it was actually pretty fun, i loved it. That's all though, if you want to know more about my ditching IM me."

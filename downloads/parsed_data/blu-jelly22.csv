i have just got back from charlie's diner and i am so full its not funny!
i like ate about 4 plates of food and now i have a stomach ache :-(
oh well, i'll get over it. 
today i made a banner for my sister when she gets back from italy, it says on it ""welcome home, kupo!"" in big red writing and around it are pictures of final fantasy characters, sponge bob square pants, family photo's and also romeo + juliet. 
yesterday i had to work from 6:30pm to 9:45pm and i got to work with astyn yay! and then when we finished we went to damon's 17th birthday party and almost everyone there was absolutely trashed. we got there at 10:30pm and stayed to about 1:00am, but it was still good :-)
i also saw saskia and she was great! she told me that she's coming to my birthday party as mortisha adams and i so can't wait! my party's only 6 days away too! 
gee i have to stay up until 11:20pm to pick my brother, simon up from the cinema, who my mum has a superstition that he really didn't go to the movies, that he's really just down the street being all hardcore on a sunday night. we'll find out sooner or later if he actually went or not hehehe simon we're on to you!
goodnight all! i'm off to do something out of the following categories A: go and play ps2. B: do my homework. or C: talk to my fella's on msn.
hmmm which will it be? lol
ok cya!

great news, i am 99.9% sure i am going to adelaide next wednesday, the 31st of august and spend time with my friend emma eaton. i am also going to see my dad and sister like at the airport, when they get off the plane and give them the surprise of a life time, as neither has any idea that i'll be waiting to great them there! hehehe
i am so pumped though, i think this will be way more exciting then my party itself! lol now thats gotta be big ;-)
me and my friend emma have got an itinerary stating our events for that day.
it's gonna be so wicked, i haven't seen emma since like this time last year so yeah ... gee i love to gloat, but i am so happy!

well anyways my day just seemed to drag on and on.
even the last few minutes of my final lesson at school seemed to take forever ... although we had a relief teacher and ended up just walking off on her like 5 minutes before the bell even rang. lol we're hardcore!

after school i had an id photo taken at telephoto, the passport photo place and it cost me $10.50 pffht i look totally dodgey in it, oh well.
then i went and got $30.00 worth of fuel for my car, a mitsubishi magna executive. its my mums car, but she lets me drive it while my dads away :-)

i feel like having a late-night i reckon, staying up playing tombi 2 on my ps2. its my best friend, damon's birthday party tomorrow and he turns 17! it starts at 8:00pm, but i have to work until 9:45pm, so i wont end up getting there till after 10:00pm, which is still cool, because i'll stay there till about 1:00am or 2:00am the next day and its gonna be wicked!

ok well i'm outtie lol, i'll catch ya's later!

my party is like right around the corner and its gonna be so cool, i so can't wait!
well lets see today i actually got to school on time, i was glad because i achieved my goal of being there on time :-) i reset my alarm clock to 6:45am instead of 7:00am and it made a hell of a difference.
i got my subjects for next year sorted WOO-HOO!!!
boy was i wrapped i finally got that one out of the way. anyways i am enrolled for hospitality, information processing and publishing and art practical. 
everyone loved the lay-out for the yr 12 jacket i made so i was proud of myself once again. 
well i don't have much else to say really, but i feel as if everything in my life is going right for a change and you know what, i feel really good about it, it makes me feel happy and care-free.
ok well goodnight all, i'm off to have a goodnight's sleep and wake-up to a fresh and early start, cya!

i am shocked at how fast the time has flown today! i was remembering all afternoon that i had to write a journal entry and before i knew it, the night night has almost finished!
i would just like to say in a response to journal entry 2 that i should try and look at the more positive side of things and not treat everything so negatively :-) i just felt kinda miserable that day, but now i am fine and that means everything is a-ok!
tonight i have made a coloured model of what the yr 12 jacket would be for the yr 12's of 2006, as i am part of the ""yr 12 jacket desgining committee."" i created the 3 fairly similar design's of what we, the committee have decided as to what the yr 12 jacket should look like. the designs are similar for various reasons as we are trying to make the jacket look super fantastic, but at the same time keep them at an reasonably affordable price.
well gee its now 10 past 10 and i better be off as i don't wont to be late to school again tomorrow as my home group teacher will chuck a skitz at me like he did today ... 
goodnight all!

i am finally home from school, thank god for that! but then again i suppose i wasn't there for long either, i rocked up at like 11:25am, just before the end of recess and managed to sneak it quite well. i really should try to be more punctual to school, because ever since i got my p's i just seemed to rock up whenever i feel like it and really thats not going to be good when it comes to exam week. 
gee i'm half-way through my last term of yr 11, only 5 more weeks and i'll have my final exams and be on my way to yr 12! 
which at the stage i am totally confused with the subjects that i will be undertaking during yr 12. you see, well heres what happend:
a few weeks back i spoke with a mr moriarty, the teacher who is incharge of flexible learning programs and how to get your SACE even if your doing and apprentiship or whatever. anyway he told me that really to get your SACE you only have to do a maximum of 3 subjects for the whole year, if you don't want to achieve a TER and go to university that is. so we spoke about what i could do and i was happily convinced to do a voc study in hospitality as 1 of my 3 subjects, which meant i would do hospitality practical work, you know like making food and such, but not have to have the hassle of doing all that ridiculous theory work. and then yesterday mr moriarty caught up with me and also the hospitality co-ordinator at our school, mrs fletcher and told us to chat about what i should do and then when he walked away she said that i should do the hospitality course subject, like what everyone else would be doing, as in the practical work + the theory and at the time i just nodded and said yeah ok if you say so, but was really thinking ""argh!!! i don't wanna do theory AHHH!!!"" 
so today i see mr moriarty again and told him what she had said to me and he tells me that i am more then likely capable of doing the theory component of hospitality in yr 12, i just basically have to put my mind to it. 
but thats not all. he also mentioned something to do with design and i'm thinking ""but i hate design"" however we talked about it and in a way i guess you could call it a coincidence? but he told me that i could do cartoon ""manga"" drawing as a subject in yr 12, which is omething i guess you could say i enjoy doing in my spare time. 
for those of you who don't know, manga is the word for japanese cartoons, such as dragon ball z, poke'mon, sailor moon, etc. any-who, long story short, now i have to go get a recommendation from mr van, the death obsessed design/art teacher at my school and also discuss with mrs golding, the senior school co-ordinator, about what i wanna do in yr 12.
and now im totally confused, because i went from believing ""hey, yr 12 seems just like a chip off the old block!"" and now i think i'm on the list to be doing the whole 5 compulsory subject timetable just like everyone else in my yr!
argh! its so not fair, i mean now that i look at it i don't even think i could be bothered cooking meals a dishing them out to other people, i just wanted to do it because it was like creative i guess, not because i'd have to write bloody stacks on work on topics like ""hospitality in different cultures,"" or ""how to be safe and hygenic in the kitchen,"" boring!
it just makes me wonder ""do i really wanna do yr 12 anymore?"" 
gee only another hour and a half until i have to start work, yippee!!! can you just feel the enthusiasm ... soz people i just don't feel in the mood, i am totally fatigued from being up till 2:00am this morning and now i gotta go put in for 3 and a half hrs at the cinema. i suppose i should look at the positives though. i guess its a hell of a lot better than working at bilo any day! (i use to have a position in night-fill at bilo, thank god the cinema were short staffed all of a sudden!)
ok well im off, i've probably bored you all to sleep with such useless and unnecessary information about me ... but i guess if that is the case, what are you doing reading about someone elses hassels in life, besides your own? 
oh i don't know, catch ya's later!

this is my first live journal entry, woo-hoo!
well i'm sad to say that my 17th birthday ended like 50 minutes ago! but not to worry because in only 9 days now narelle (my elder sister), will be back from italy and i seriously can not wait to see her again! i can't believe she's been gone for like 10 months and she'll be home in less then a fortnight! and also my 17th birthday party is only 12 days away, wow!!! thats something i seriously can't wait for! for all of you who don't already know, i am have costume theme for my party, so everyone invited HAS to dress up :-P my costume is totally awesome, it's fairly similar to that of something i saw billie joe armstrong, from greenday, wearing on the front cover of a sain magazine and when its complete its gonna go off ... well i hope it does anyways :-) 
ahem well yesterday ... on my 17th lol, i was awoken at 6:45am to the knocking of my bedroom door, but i wasn't annoyed in any way, because it was my birthday and i was pumped! 
anyways i opened the door and my mum was standing there with my brother, simon. she was holding a tray in her hands, with scrambled eggs on toast, special-k with chopped up strawberries on top, a mug of milo, a glass of water and a card in a white envelope. the 2 wished me a happy birthday and my mum gave me my preasent, the tray she had made up for me, which was breakfast in bed! i went back to my bed and ate the food and opened the envelope. inside was a birthday card from my family and a $100 note. 
well that was the start of my day and i must say it was my most favourite thing i had enjoyed for all of yesterday ... next to it would have to be comming home from school and eating all the yummy sweets and birthday cake my mum had made for me, although now i feel like totally sick from eating so much junk-food, i'm gonna have to seriously exercise my brains out tomorrow to loose it all!
ok well i guess i best be off, 
good-bye.

"event","Maybe my first entry wasn't so hot... i haven't exactly figured out how to delete things yet so i'm going to ask everybody to act like it doesn't exist. Everybody, act like it doesn't exist.

""All i can say is my life is pretty plain. I like watching the puddles gather rain."" -blind melon... 90's song... video with the little bumble-bee girl... ring any bells?

Most things are going pretty well as of right now. But, being my remarkably boring self, i feel just as i would if i was told that i had cancer and they were going to remove my pinky... Okay i would be a little bit more on the sad side, i do love my pinky, but not much more i assure you.

My brother is currently in a city more than an hour away (times may vary due to mode of trasportation, driver, and seagull concetration. time given is an estimate for a car driven by the average adult with little to no seagull concentration.) which is pretty awesome. My sister and mom are too which is also a big plus. Not that i hate my family or anything, it's just kind of nice to get away for a while, or, in my case, to stay and let them get away. My dad happens to be in a better mood (average to happy.)

There are days where i would pay a good $7.83 for it to be like this, but it doesn't feel too exciting. I'm going to louiseville tomorrow. I'm going with 3-4 of the very best people on earth so that's really nice. Maggie cool person number one is my girlfriend and her vast awesome cornacopia (major spelling slaughter there) is perhaps the coolest thing ever. Matt, cool person numero dos, is my best friend since i don't know when, he's pretty talented in everything, and shares, to some degree, the same tastes as i.

-sidenote: it really stinks when you come across a very very (insert positve adjective here) song and you reach/move your cursor to turn up the volume only to realize it is already as loud as possible

Gabriel, cool person numer 3, maggie's mom: she pretty much rocks in all aspects. Tyler, cool person 4, maggie's friend from -------------ville (i'm trying to be descreet because of all the internet stalkers after my bod) tyler is very odd, which is almost synonomouse with cool. He was just born about 30 years too late... sorry bud

well everything promises not to be too horrible, and i'm tired of typing on here so untill i get bored again... see ya dudes"

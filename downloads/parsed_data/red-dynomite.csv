"event","<p align=""center"">i saw him tonight. the one person that i dared to even try to give any little part of my heart to. i've only told a few about him and what his impression was on me. but everytime i've seen him or spoken to him within the last year... i can't help but be speechless. everything comes rushing back and i skip a beat. not just my heart but my body and my mind. it's weird. like in movies when a character gets caughtup and blinks a lot when scenes flash before their eyes. yes, i'm a movie star. but this is no romance movie. 

i saw him tonight. we spoke to eachother. we hugged when he left. like nothing had ever hapened. 

this happens every time i see him. like a bad scene that's played before my eyes over and over. but this was different. 

when he looked at me with his big (undeniably gorgeous) brown puppy dog eyes... i didn't feel a thing. nothing at all for him. i didn't even feel the desire to talk to him for any longer than i had to. he begged me for my phone number, ( i claimed i didn't have a cell) he asked when we could hang out and begged me to come to his party. party? i don't party. i didn't mind standing and talking to him. but i noticed that i really wanted to be somewhere else. 

it's weird and no one may understand it... but i looked at this boy who i was entwined in for so so long... so so long ago, and didn't feel anything for him. he didn't throw me off like before, he didn't rape through my emtions. he tried to get me off the track that i'm on, but i didn't fal for his stupid little mind games anymore. as gorgeous as his eyes may be, i knew that i had no real place in them, and he shouldn't have any in mine. 

i thought about him very little. but the time that i did, i thought about how proud i was of myself. that i didn't become suseptible (sp?) to what i had been so many times before. i felt like i had grown up and matured. i am proud of myself for being able to resist like that. 

so yeah. i don't know where i was going with this. but i needed to get it out.

i just might have to confess just where i stand. 
becuase lately you make me weaker the kness, 
and you race through my veins everytime your close to me. 
take me away to places i aint seen. 
you say you've got a hold on me. 
and i won't disagree.</p>"

"event","so a lot of people don't know that i have three older sisters. well, news; i do. two of them are married and have kids, and one is still single. sadly, i talk to kerrie, the single one, more than anyone else in my family. we try to ignore eachother becuase of our pasts and drama crap.<br />any ways, kerrie wants to come to my graduation- which is great, no joke. but she hasn't talked to my parents about any of this, and i;m sort of afraid of what could unfold with al of us and her in the same house again. <br /> whats worse is that i'm the only one who knows that she's been engaged for five months. wait until my mom finds out that she didn't tell her.<br /> i don't know... i just doin't want anyhting horrible to unravel. and i'm nervous. nervous nervous nervous..."

"event","ok. hello. i'm new. whatever.

so anyways, (i guess this is what you do here,) last night i went to a winterguard competition. yes yes. i'm a guard girl, although always and forever a band geek. anyways, we got home at like, twelve-thirty. how tiring! we pulled into the parking lot and my friend said ""jessie! your car is covered in crap!"" sure enough, toothpaste and sunblock. what retards tag cars with toothpaste and sunblock? and then, what losers leave their freaking names smeared on your window?!

anyways, i called these few certain kids, and got one of them to confess and rat on the other kids by telling them i was in an accident because toothpaste is for your teeth, not  your windshield.
""ok. well, you guys are really pissing me off so here's what's going down..."" i said quite harshly. ""i'm coming to get you and him right now, and we're going to her house, and you're cleaning my car. right now.""

""what?! it's almost 1 am!?""

""whatever. you should have thought of that."" 

so i had three cranky teenagers cleaning my car until two that morning, with apple dish soap. and minty, wet apples do not smell good at all. so yeah. i have to say tht if they didn't agree to clean it there might have been a beat down...
i promise these will get more interesting."

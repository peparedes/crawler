"event","<span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">Since I haven't updated recently, and i have the chance to do it now on Jason's lap top without him TRULY knowing exactly what I am doing (hehehe), I decided to FINALLY update.  So much has happened these past couple of weeks, and the only really exciting thing i can remember (besides my dad spitting up a shot) is that musical rehearsals started on Tuesday.  I've been waiting for them to start ever since I got my script like 3 weeks before Winter Break. In 2 days we blocked a whole scene, got the first part of my  song choreographed, and got some of the ensemble songs learned.... Now hopefully people will  just remember all of the things we have already gone over.  I'm thinking of beginning to write a story, but since i'm not so great at coming up with ideas for stories I'm going to ask you all (John and Jason lol) to help me out by give me: Ideas, character names, settings, plots, and pretty much anything you can come up with.  I kinda thought you guys might enjoy a story that you made the ideas for. I figured you two would give me ideas and stuff, and then I would figure out a way for all of them to connect, and i would make a story out of them.  Then when you go and read the entries you can look for where I placed your ideas, so when you read the entries than you  have something else to look forward to.  If you suggest i don't even bother (since I know that's what Jason is most likely going to say) just let me know so i don't waste my time writing a story that absolutely NOBODY wants to read lol.  Well that's all for now.  Talk to you all l8er! ^_^</span>"

"event","I've had a good couple weeks since Thanksgiving break, and now that it is Wednesday, and Christmas/Christmas break is coming up I'm having an even better week.  Although this week has gone pretty darn slow, overall it has been the most useless week of school.  Were learning like nothing because our teachers don't want to start anything they know they wont be able to finish within the week.  Tomorrow, Thursday, is my real last day because on Friday we are having 20 minute core periods, and then after lunch, periods 7,8, and 9, we are going to be watching a movie of our choice.  I choose to watch The Fantastic Four because I haven't yet seen it, though my brother,David, has.  We will also be working on our portfolios a bit because our teachers do portfolios every so often during the year so we're not scrambling around at the end of the year trying to get them finished when all we want to do is go home.  I cant wait until break because I can FINALLY sleep till i die.  Hope you all enjoy your breaks, and a Happy holiday.  See y'all next year (in 2006)."

"event","Today was a good day, and its getting even better every hour.  My brothers coming today and is expected around 8:00 so i'm EXTREMELY excited over that.  I'm also excited as my brother, David, will be taking the three of us and some of his friends bowling this weekened as a birthday Jason coming back thing.  I'm not too  good at bowling, but theres an occasional double strike, though soon after it goes in the gutter about 100 times.  I'm also excited as each day is a day closer to Christmas Break.  This is the day i've been waiting for ever since Thanksgiving break.  I cant wait till Christmas.  It's going to be great having another family celebration with Jason here.  Every time he goes back to college I anticipate his next arrival a LOT more.  My dad is also starting to miss him more each and every time he leaves.  David doesn't seem to miss him at all, but I can tell he's slightly lonely without getting a beat down in Soul Calibur III from Jason.  As for my mom she's always missed him and this time will be no exception.  Shes growing used to it being just the four of us, and she's stopped puting an extra table setting just for the thought of Jason being there.  Next week in school is supposed to be an EXTREMELY EASY week since no teachers want to start anything they cant end by the end of the week.  Well I'm done for now as I want to go back to singing to the music from Rent!!!"

"event","This week was fairly good, considering I had my chorus concert Monday evening, and an assembly for the school Tuesday during 8th and part of 9th periods, and today i had my Drama Club party for all of the members in the cast.  It was a blast hanging out with the crew and getting to know some of the new people I will be working with.  In science today (this is for Jason) I learned about Potential and Kinetic Force.  We didn't go into any details so it wasn't terribly exciting.  In math we had a sub, Mrs. Fenstermacher for anyone who cares, and we had to work on a packet that is preparing us for the P.S.S.A's.  In english we continued talking about poetry,and in Social Studies we continued our study of George Washington and some of the events that occurred during his presidency.  Tomorrow I have Orchestra Dress rehearsal during 3+4 periods, and then my concert tomorrow evening at 7:30, and it would be cool to see some of my high school buds come, but wouldn't really make a difference if they didn't.  I'm waiting in uncontrollable anticipation for Friday to come as my brother, Jason, will be venturing back home for 4 weeks of vacation after a grueling Semester.  I know people who read my LJ most likely read his too, but i have to congratulate him on all of his good grades that he's been getting and maintaining since about the beginning of the school year.  In some ways I strive to be like him, but in some ways I hope I'm not.  I want to do as well in school as him, as I am right now, but I'm hoping to make different accomplishments than him (though his were very commendable).  I also look forward to possibly getting together with Jason and some of his friends (hint hint! ^_^) if during vacation he happens to get together with Ryan and all of those people.  I also hope to give John a beat down in Soul Calibur III, and if not (most likely) a MAJOR beat down in Super Smash Bros. Melee! (GO PEACH!!! GO PEACH!!!)"

"event","Hey peeps,
    I know i haven't updated for a long while, but i've been pretty busy with school.  I got the part that i wanted in our school play, Anything Goes, William C. Crocker (A.K.A. Billy).  He's in almost every scene and has the most lines out of all the 8 leads so i was busy memorizing some of my lines.  Other than that i've been trying to find time to do the things that i like doing as well, such as kicking A** with my level 55 ice Sorceress in Diablo (GO FROZEN ORB!!!) , and going to the movies with some friends to watch Rent! (saddest movie EVER!!!).  I was also busy sleeping in on our snow day this past friday, but i am anxious to get back to my current life (school).  I'll try to update as much as possible, but come Christmas break i doubt i'll be able to find time between school, the musical, practicing lines, and homework, but i'll try my best to keep y'all informed."

"event","YES!!!! Once again we return to the hustle and bustle of school. People trampling you, pushing, shoving, yelling, whispering, giggling, flirting, hugging, making out in the hall way (seriously get a room), and compacting more information into our craniums.

"event","Today was pretty good considering the way the beginning of my week went lol. I had rehearsal tonight for my community theater which is putting on an all kids show called Round the World and Back Again. Its about how the world came to be (from crazy scientists, to early humans, to famous explorers such as Columbus (me ^_^) ).   We had our first three performances last weekend, and our last three are this weekend. I feel pretty confident and tonight's practice just bolsters that feeling.  Tonight at rehearsal we all kind of jazzed up the last scene (a war scene between a Blue, Yellow, and Red army). The blue army (since we were not running the show with costumes tonight) decided to be a little funny and instead of saying, ""Hail blue  army"" they decided to say, ""hail multi-colored army"". That got everyone smiling, but the best part was when my army (the reds) decided to go pink and give ourselves valley girlish voices. It was the greatest thing i had EVER seen.

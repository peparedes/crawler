"event","So today I see a post that one of my friends neighbors baby stopped breathing, and was not doing well.&nbsp; At dinner a fried who works for the police dept mentions that a baby had died, and they had to investigate it.&nbsp; Get home, see facebook again and another friend posted wishing prayers and comfort for her neighbor and her neighbors brother and sister in law, who are also my friends.&nbsp; My brain of course puts all this together, and I send her a message to confrm.&nbsp; One of my really good friends lost his little boy today.&nbsp; he was a month and a half younger than Earl.&nbsp; this friend has had a rough time in the past.&nbsp; Made some bad decisions, and got into some things he shouldn&#39;t have.&nbsp; He had finally gotten everything together, finished college, met a girl, and had a baby he loved very very much.&nbsp; he recently got a promotion and is goign to be moving out of state soon.&nbsp; He&#39;s already working some there, but she and the baby have stayed here for now.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are getting married next month.

I can&#39;t even begin to imagine how bad this hurts them.&nbsp; I hope they are able to weather through it.&nbsp; I hope that I can help them in some way.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven&#39;t been able to stop crying snce I heard.&nbsp; Luckily E is still to little to realize, and Weeji did a good job of keeping katie away from me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

"event","Wow.  It's been a whirlwind lately. Weeji and I went to watch Nightmare Before Christmas 3d on Friday.  It was very cool.  Then we went to the fair and to the rodeo.  Ate meat on a stick.  When we got home Katie was fussing and Nana was trying to calm her.  She finally calmed down and went back to the crib.  Then she fussed again Weeji took a turn.  Then I decided I'd just snuggle with her in the recliner and sleep in there.  After a while she pointed to the crib.  I got up and she proceeded to barf everywhere.  After we got that all cleaned up Nana decided to just snuggle with her on the couch.  She threw up 3 or 4 more times that night. 
   We were supposed to do Race for the Cure on Saturday, but decided to pass this year. Didn't figure she would be up to it.  Katie slept til after 8 Saturday morning. Then just say and cuddled with me in the recliner.  About 9 she decided it was time to go watch ""Melmo"" (Sesame Street) and was quite upset it wasn't on.  But generic cartoons soothed her.  We went and got Weeji up about 10.  Played around the house for a while.  Since she was chilly we put socks on her.  This was a mistake.  If socks go on, this means shoes go on, which means we go outside. So after a little while we decided to go for a walk.  Katie then goes to the van and pats.  Weeji and I decided to go to Wendy's then to the park.  
   At the park you would not have been able to tell she had been sick at all.  She ran and played and giggled.  After about an hour and a half she bumped her head and had a meltdown.  I picked her up and she rested her head over onto me.  She was asleep before we hit the house.
   While she napped, I loaded up the van and went to set up for the DJ gig I had at the country club. I got back just as she woke up.  And she had no energy at all. She just sat and wanted to be cuddled.  She was not happy when I had to leave."

 Through a strange set of events, I found myself in possession of a $45 gift card to Best Buy.  I was trying to decide what to spend it on, between a couple of box sets, 3 or 4 individual CD's, some DVD's or some memory for the computer.  So I thought about it, and came to the reazlization that I really don't want to buy CD's.  Now for those of you that know me well, you are probably as shocked as I am.  For those that don't know me very well, I'm a compulsive CD collector.  I have somewhere around 2,000-2,500.  They dominate the middle room of our house.  If I have a CD by an artist I want all CD's by that aritst, whether I listen to them or not.  Of the CD's I have there's probably a couple of hundred that I've never listened to all the way through, or even played  at all.

    Now I'm not swearing off CD's all together.  I'll still buy new albums put out by people I like.  And I'll still shop used stores some.  I'm just giving up on ""completing my collections"".  Sure one day I'll finish getting all the Beatles albums, and probably most of the AC/DC albums I'm missing.  But buying ""Done With Mirrors"" just so I'll have all the Aerosmith albums?  Probably not.  Tracking down the Jesus and Mary chain disc that I don't have, even though I have all those songs on other albums, not unless I run across it used and cheap. 

  Part of this may have been brought on by me digitizing my music, and the CD player in my car dying.  I rarely listen to a whole album anymore.  I load up my MP3 player at random and listen to it.  That way it uploads to Last.FM (Regnowsin is my user ID).  I do have a CD player (partly responsible for that Gift card, YAY extended warranty at Best Buy) that works in my car now, so that might change again, but that's where I am for now."

Just heard on the news that a POLICE OFFICER had charges dropped against him because ... wait for it...   His fucking superiors didn't read the poor dumbass his rights.  Now, is it just me, or shouldn't a cop know their rights?  They only have to read it every time they arrest someone.  I'd love to hear how this went down it the courtroom.  ""Nope.  They didn't read me my rights.  I know they're supposed to, because I have to.  So, since they didn't I just told them what I wanted to hear.  'Cause I knew I'd get out of it"".  I fucking hate what the lawyers have done to our country.  I understand there's a fine line.  But for Christ's is there really anyone out there who was raised in USA who doesn't know their rights?  Isn't it time we stopped throwing shit out because someone didn't read it to them.  Especially when the damned person who is arrested is going ""but they didn't read me my rights.  I know they're supposed to because I watch TV and movies.""  Hell, they even read rights in Police Academy.  You don't even have to watch Law and Order.  I'm all for civil liberties and so forth, but if the bastard's guilty, they're guilty.  Fuck the technicalities.  Fuck the pampering.  Fuck their self esteem.

"event","who designed the way Dodge secures their batteries into their cars and beat the snot out of him.  My battery died yesterday.  Which was fun.  Weeji drove me into work, and Laurie and the kids came and picked me up a little after I got off so we could go the the Alice Cooper show.  Other than the heat, the show ruled.  I'll post about it later, probably.  However once I got home I had to put the new battery in.  Well Dodge has it attached with a plate, that uses a bolt in a teeny-tiny little area.  I could barely get my hand down in there, much less a ratchet or wrench.  So I finally decide I have to go get a deep-well socket.  Not 100% sure about the size I need though.  So, being 1:00 am my choice is Wal-Mart, or Wal-Mart.  So I choose Wal-Mart.  Go over there and see the deep-well sockets.  $15.  I also see a ""gator grip"" socket.  Also $15. It looks like it would be deep enough, and I don't have to worry about metric or standard.  So I get it.  Get home.  It doesn't work.  So I go to the other Wal-Mart, and get the $15 set.  I also pick up the $10 extensions so I can actually use the ratchet. Once I got home with that it was not that bad to get fixed.  However it was about 2:15 am.  And STILL 90 degrees.  So I get a shower and get to bed.
  About the time I drift off Katie starts screaming.  So I get up and snuggle with her a while in the recliner.  About 2:40 I put her back in the crib and she starts screaming again.  Weeji got up with her that time, and apparently I crashed.  I woke up about 5 with a foot in my back, and was about to slap it, when I realized it was Katie.  Apparently she would not stop crying unless she was being held so Weeji went ahead and brought her in when she came back to bed.  Eventually I got her situated and snuggled with her and we went back to sleep.  It was nice."

"event","I'm still at Alltel. Still in Advanced Tech.  It's interesting.  Some of the people you talk to are pretty cool.  Some are complete idiots.  Had one guy take 2 minutes to type in ""#"".  After about a minute he asked where is the number sign. So I told him <Shift> 3.  After about another minute he goes ""OH! You got to hit them together!""  It was all I could do not to laugh, or say you gotta be kidding right?  

My plans for school this fall be have fallen through.  Seems the info I'd gotten from some of my coworkers that Pulaski Tech would defer tuition if you worked for Alltel were not correct.  So I'd have to come up with about $500 by Monday.  Probably work out better to wait 'til next semester anyway.

Katie is still adorable.  Although she is starting to get a little stubborn.  Even at her worst though, she's still amazingly fantastic.  Her favorite words right now are ""cookie"" meaning anything that goes in her mouth, including her pacifier, and ""Yeah"" which she says in the cutest way.  She and Weeji have been doing swim lessons the last few weeks and Katie LOVES it.  She doesn't always play along with the teacher, but has a lot of fun.

And finally on the music front, got 2 possible groups to play with, but scheduling and personnel are both hanging us up.  Both have a singer, and me on bass.  One may or may not have a guitarist and drummer.  Both are kind of on the ""sure I'll play, maybe next week"" sort of thing.  The other has a probable guitarists and drummer, and maybe practice space, we just have to actually get together.  I'm basically hanging back to see what happens."

OK.  So today was ""shift bid"" at work. This is where we pick out our shifts for next schedule. I've been looking forward to this with the idea I might be able to see Weeji and Katie next bid.  However instead I got bent over the table and fisted up to the elbow.  Now, you might think, surely it's not that bad. Yeah, how does fuckin' 5pm to 2 am sound? Now the only thing that makes this a little less shitty is that I have Friday and Saturday off.  My only other choices were decent hours, but working both weekend days. What really pissed me off is that I picked 41 out of 70.  I bust my ass, and do a good job.  I looked at the ""Key perfomance indicators"" that they listed as what they used to pick the order.  I can't figure out how the fuck I got that low.  One of the guys who picked in the top 5 was way lower than me on 2 of the 6, the same on 2 of the 6 and only slighty higher on the other 2.  Some of my teammates who had almost identical stats were 20 people or more above me.  So I am back on the job market again.  I hate it, because I like Alltel, and like my job.  But I can't fuckin work that.  And to complete my night, Katie just pissed all over me. </lj-cut>
Ok this song actually made me smile a bit."

Everything seemed to go wrong with you.  You had high hopes and high expectations, and you poured the money into making sure it happened.  But something along the way went wrong.  People just didn't tune in.  And because you tried to go for the bigger mainstream audience, you didn't inject enough innovative material to make the experts take notice.  An failure in every sense of the word, FOX lets you go after a meager three episodes.

Katie keeps getting bigger.  She's almost talking now.  I don't know if she actually means it, but she will kinda say ""hi"" and she definitely says mama and dada.  She's quite amazing.


Also it was great to see Albee, Pixystixfairy, and the G-man a couple of Sundays ago.  Hopefully we can get together again soon for a little longer, and when our clan isn't recovering from sickness.

I am loving the mornings with Katie.  I usually hang out with her 'til 8:30 or 9 then take her in.  Part of me feels bad about not keeping her longer, but I also figure we're paying for the daycare might as well use it.  I'm still recovering from out house being robbed.  It hit Weeji a lot worse since the main thing they took was her jewelry (including a lot with emotional value).  They also got the PS2 and most of our games.  I've got to get a hold of the insurance company tomorrow to see how to file a claim. Went up to see mom and dad this weekend.  Both are doing well.

Katie's getting bigger and bigger.  She pulls up when we're hold her hands, and wants to crawl so bad it seriously pisses her off when she can't.  But she's so adorable.

Job-wise I'm doing tech support for Alltel cellular.  If you have Alltel and your phone screws up, you may get to talk to me.  The pay's good, the benefits are great, the job's easy and interesting.  The only down side is the hours completely blow.  Other than that I love it.

Also I've got a DJ gig tomorrow night and at least one more for the year, which will put me making a little bit of a profit after buying all new gear and a crapload of CD's.  This means hopefully with out tax return I can get a laptop and external harddrive this year to save my back a little pain.

That's about all I got for now."

The first player of this game starts with the topic of ""5 Guilty Pleasures"" and people who get tagged need to write an LJ entry about 5 Guilty Pleasures as well as state this rule clearly. In the end you need to choose 5 people to be tagged and list their names.

1. 80's rap.
2. Hair-metal.
3. Comic books.
4. Disco.
5. Overalls."

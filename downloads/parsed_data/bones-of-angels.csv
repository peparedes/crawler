"event","Ok, theres plenty reason I couldnt put this in deadjournal because ""someone"" reads that one. But...I dont want him to know that I know, and I dont wanna jinx nothin. But my mom had just told me that the chick she hitches a ride to work with sometimes, has a son that works at corrigated with pete, and well hes getting a divorce so he needed to find a place ta dwell, and Pete being in almost the same situation, had asked this guy if he wanted to pitch in on a place with him on Ash st. in Albion. I could have SHIT. GOD I hope he moves...Oh and mom told me this chick hes wanting to leave also has 2 kids...what was he thinking of?! I mean, I know that doesnt really fuck a person up to have kids, but he wasnt ready to be with someone that had kids if you ask me...because I dont think Id be able to handle that shit myself. I can understand if youre with the parent that dont have the custody of the kids...but shit ya know...complicated. But anyways...couldnt you just pee?! Im not gonna say anything about knowing about it though, lol...I have no idea why...but I just wont....It would make me seem like I had hounds out on him...and that'd be just weird. But yeah...I hope the phone gets turned back on soon because I really wanna call him...just to talk basically...Hopefully sprint will stop fucking us in the ass...and hopefully somebody be it mom or dad will pay the mother fucking bill. Anyhow...Meeshi...(heh its not like there should really be anyone else reading this but you) I miss, we really need to figure out a way to hang sometime soon man...I miss talking to you...and telling you basically everything like Im doing right now, lol. Everytime I hear something, youre always the first one I cant wait to tell. GOD I wish your car wasnt a peice. *sigh* heart deary..."

"event","Yeah..I havent updated this shit in a little while here...so my excuse is that I got lost. It could work for just about anything if you really think about it...not valid...but an excuse. haha what the fuck am I thinking about??? goddamn. Well anyways...just got done reading those new comments in meeshi's journal...thats some FUCKING BULLSHIT. That bitch needs to check herself because all this shit is just stupid and uncalled for and when shit is stupid and uncalled for, then things happen that are stupid and uncalled for. ya know? But anyways..enough of that crap...although humorous its still a waste of time and nicotene is calling so...Muah."

"event","shit. shit fuck damn. fuckity shit mother bitch fuck. I have no smokes. NONE. Damn the government and its taxing ways for making me too poor to buy another pack. GOD!!! yes i am addicted, im addicted like a sum-umma-bitch. Ill admit it dammit..its not like this is the support group or anything. But yeah...on to what my last entry was talking about. It was bothering me all day. So I asked Jim straight up ""dude, did you use me?"" and he said no, that hes just been busy...whatever though. I dont really give a fuck as of now, lol. He kinda...acted like I was crazy for asking that...like I had no reason to or some shit...but I mean...fuck if its bothering me I had to ask...Im sick of restraining myself just for the sake of not being weird. Its a gift to be openly fucked up, and I think Ill resort to exposing my gift to others goddamnit. So ya know...If he thinks im a fucked up crazy bitch...oh well, its not like im emotionally interwoven or anything, lol..i mean come on, as of now i couldnt give a fuck if i never talked to him again...i only met him like what...a week or some shit ago, its not like hes a staple to my everything...and its pretty funny that I got upset about that shit...Oh well, i mean. I like him, but not enough to fret over him. SOooo....I think im going to hunt for funds for my feindish addiction...Toodles and farewell my dear audience of one person. MUAH."

"event","Ive been pissed for the past few days...not really at anyone more than myself. I let him desecrate everything that I am...and for what? Its not like I havent done it before...but then I knew what the fuck was going to happen, I had no plans of even liking that person...I KNEW WHAT THE FUCK I WAS DOING. How stupid could I have been to be fooled like that...I knew what was going on, I knew this would happen, but i ignored it because i didnt want to acknowlage it...I knew that I wanted that certain kind of attention and I didnt want to see that I was being used. I dont know, maybe im over reacting...its not like he up and broke up with me or anything...but what kind of person is so attentive before, and then it all just follows a downward spiral once he fucks me. This shit isnt going to work out...despite what the fuck the cards say, i dont think this shit is going to work. I need someone to love me...and not just the platonic love shared between friends, but someone to want to know me, and love me for what i am and not for what can be done with me under the sheets. Maybe I am just being a dumb ass...following the ever so certain search for something that doesnt exsist, Well its not like im following it to the fucking edges of the earth...but I just dont want to be used. Thats what Im feeling like...I feel used. What the fuck am I looking for? I couldnt quite say...Im so scared of being attached to someone, but I still want that presence...again theres no good without the bad, can I truly deal with hurt...i dont know. Obviously im not doing so well with it now huh. god i just wish i knew that everything was fine and that i was just being stupid...maybe its stupid not to mention it...but shit, it doesnt even feel like were dating so whats the point...? It would just make me feel like more of an idiot...the insignificant nagging girlfriend so wrapped in feelings that it blinds her from her own stupidity. I have such an anger pent up in me...and no real direction for it really. I dont know what im mad at because i dont know whats going on. I know that I have a direction...but no motive. Even if i had that motive...i would waste it like i did before. See this is what happens...this is what happens to me. Maybe im better off alone...but shit i cant say that without a hesitation. I just need someone that will make me feel secure...make me feel happy, like someone cares about me truly in the sence that I can have that safety net if i fell. No...scratch that...I dont need shit...All i need are my friends and thats it, i was doing just fine until this shit happened...I didnt have to worry about if i was being used or anything. I was fucking happy. No, I am happy...im not gonna let this shit bother me...thats what goddamnit. Theres no reason to let this shit dilute me into someone that Im not...Ive been through shit for way too long for this to up and knock me over. fuck that. heh...look at me babbling on...im not even sure what im talking about really. Fucking crazy bitch thats what I am...but oh well, if the shoes fit."

"event","OK yeah...i was just bein a snoop and reading through everyones journals...well the people I know atleast..and I decided to look at Saras, well it turns out little miss rich girl is getting a lap top (now try and tell me her family is poor) and she was talking about writing another poem about me just to stir shit up so she can get comments on it...God she is so pathetic, she has to start shit just for attention...yeah REAL mature sara. Well this time im just gonna make sure neither me or michelle say anything about it because all she wants is our attention and im gonna make damn sure she aint gonna get it that way, if she wants attention she had better find a more suitable way to get it. She was all acting synical about me hanging out with michelle...well you know what, michelle is by far a better person and more human than what that cunt sara is, or will ever be. I swear if she keeps fuckin with me ima give her a nice little gift for her birthday...im gonna bust her goddamn teeth out. Im fuckin done with goin around in circles with her and I think its best that I just ignore her really...im done talking to her, reading her shitty poetry and reading her journal, i dont wanna know anything about her or hear from her...because everytime i hear her name it pisses me off and she aint worth the emotion. lol...i swear she just makes me wanna chain smoke. Well anyways...change of subjects. My hair is fryed now...and I got the atomic pink like I wanted. Its brighter than it was before though...this shit is super neon pink. I almost need sunglasses to look at the shit in the morning after i wake up. Its really pretty but its fryed all to hell...now i have to learn how to manage it because its almost like dealing with curly hair and ive never had to do that so i gotta learn i guess. Anyways...ive gotta go...toodles"

It was hell in the process man...First me and Michelle bleached it, and it turned carrot top orange...the pink WAS NOT gonna take to something that dark...so I bleached it again today, and it still didnt take everywhere...so yeah I have dark spots...but I can deal really...im pretty sure theres more mistakes down the road...why me?"

"event","No. I didnt feel like doing a survey, so I'll just bitch here for a minute. Ive got nothing better to do really...ya know...you can really tell when you have no life when youve been wearing pajamas for 3 days straight. I think I wanna rent a game tonight....something long in duration so that I can get cramps in my hands..I know that I wont be able to mess with my guitar tonight...i sat and practiced my major chords last night and woke up with fucking blisters on the tips of my fingers...which sounds bad, but its actually great...it means not too long until my fingers calus over, which means that fucking E string wont hurt as much anymore...that bastard used to hurt so bad on a C major but im getting prone to it now. Actually I cant really even feel texture anymore with the 3 fingers on my left hand (yay). Oh yeah, and I did manage to figure out Kashmir by Zeppelin, i have the right idea, but my timing is off....thats one thing that gets me the most is my timing is always off. ANYWAYS...Im going to bleach my hair...im done with the black for now...I want my pink hair back...and I want it back now! goddamnit. It was so pretty hehe. Mom said she'll buy me the bleach...i just havent told her that I want the pink hair dye with it, lol. And if things go the way I want them I want my old atomic pink instead of virgin rose...i had that shit the last time i dyed it pink and it wasnt as pretty of a color..but it did last longer. Well anyways i should go get dressed and shit and beg mom to take me to j-town or the BC...so on that note...i leave you with the ""lyric of the day""...be smart and guess it. (I felt the hate rise up in me, kneel down and clear the stone of leaves, I wander out where you cant see, Inside my shell I wait and bleed.)"

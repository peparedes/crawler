"event","At my most beautiful - By J.Vargo

I can't blame you 
though I wish I could
I blame circumstance
and coincidence
they made us fools to think 
our world was real
beauty is the truth
keats told us all well
and you've allowed me to live and breathe
in this cold, compact hell
we made ourselves dancers 
in demise
and lovers of an age
but our time is sifting fast
and the end is catching up with us

yesterday was too long
forever wasnt enough
someday we're gonna laugh
at how this all seemed so tough
you'l take my hand 
we will dance with whats left of us
and pretend the world isnt real
find the beauty of it
cause the truth is in there
with nothing left to lose 
and I am at my most beautiful"

I hate living for the moment sometimes. It's almost painful to be so prophetic.. 

Ah well..

Going to Saginaw tomarow. FINALY getting a Cell phone.. A real one!!! YAY! I'll message my phone number to people when I get it. Gonna go see Prince Caspian tomarow. I've been wanting to see it for awhile now, but other stuff came up. I'm exited like major. I want a razor phone really badly. I just like how they look and all. I know I shoulnt get a phone for the look, but it's got a great signal and it's sexy, just like moi.

Gah, sorry for the materialistic rant there lol. This weekend I am going to an expo thats all new age stuff. I am exited! Chris, Bill and I are going. Belly dancers ;) oh yes..

Meow.. Gah. two months til school starts.. I'm going insane. Ash and I are gonna have a yard sale to raise funds, but I don't have a great deal. I pray I make like 10 bucks lol. Were gonna have candy to sell too, just so we can make a few bucks there. I am getting rid of all the clutter in my room and it feels really good to break free of all the junk. Very Karmatic, or something lol.

Well I'm off, yea this wasnt the best blog.. but oh well. I am bored."

But I'm running out of patience... and I don't know if I can hold on. I'm afraid I may have to grab the scissors... 

I hate putting up song lyrics to describe my feelings. But Ani does help me so much.

Ani Difranco - So What

who's gonna give a shit
who's gonna take the call
when you find out that the road ahead
is painted on a wall
and you're turned up to top volume
and you're just sitting there in pause
with your feral little secret
scratching at you with its claws
and you're trying hard to figure out
just exactly how you feel
before you end up parked and sobbing
forehead on the steering wheel

who are you now
and who were you then
that you thought somehow
you could just pretend
that you could figure it all out
the mathematics of regret
so it takes two beers to remember now
and five to forget
that i loved you so
yeah, i loved you, so what

how many times undone
can one person be
as they're careening through the facade
of their favorite fantasy
you just close your eyes slowly
like you're waiting for a kiss
and hope some lowly little power
will pull you out of this
but none comes at first
and little comes at all
and when inspiration finally hits you
it barely even breaks your fall

who were you then
and who are you
now that you can't pretend
that you can figure it all out
subtract out the impact
and the fall is all you get
so it takes two beers to remember now
and three more to forget
that i loved you so
yeah, i loved you, so what
i loved you
so what"

Water Cycle 

a rhyme of 
love... 
a sign of our essence 
life is at it's finest 
when it enlists 
in 
effervecence 
we bubble like a dream 
and it seems we're at the top 
but bubbles 
arn't forever 
can you hear it... 

*pop* 

this is where I ended 
a poem of prediction 
during the days of 
my drunken confessions 
and fatalistic 
conviction 

But bubbles can last.. 
the burst is mere 
begining 
because 
floating in the air 
is 
not 
mearly pretending 

We can find eachother in the remains of 
the other evaporating 
popping 
passers on 
and we hold 
to eachother 
tight 
and make through, 
as dew

"event","It's rather sad, but this era has finally passed. I no longer like grilled cheese sandwiches..

I used to love them. I made ash cook them all the time and I would make them whenever I had the chance as a kid.

Today has been a lazy day (I didnt officialy wake up til 2 or so) I got out the pan and made one up quick. It smelled delicious like usual.. but ... it just wasnt that good..

Now belive me I can cook.. but it wasnt good..

It was greasy and gooey and nothing I really wanted to eat. I blotted it with paper towels and got the butter out as much as I could.. but it was still icky. 

How can you go from loving something to hating it.. Theres a poem somewhere in all this.. but I'm not feeling up to writing it. .... ok so I had to lmao.

Goodbye to Grilled Cheese (a cheesy farewell):

""Oh where is my cheese?""
""I'm here.. I'm here..."" -A quote from my childhood memory bank.

I'm not a kid anymore.. It's no secret to me
and I'm not searching for sympathy.
I'm just contemplating the end of 
a love affair with my former
beloved.

You were hot. I was willing.
You were moist and would melt
when I spread you apart
my tongue would tingle with your flavors.
I was only a child then
how could I know that this day would come

You're greasy, slimy, and burn up to quickly in the flames of our love
it's about time I found 
some more interesting delight...
one that will last the night

I'm moving on.
our love has ended and the only thing proven true
is you're no good for me
and so my love.. adieu"

Wheeler Hall: Room 811, Bed A

You win Donnie. I can live in a Alcohol free dorm, cause I get one of my friends instead :)

Well, theres not much left to do now. Just have my Orientation to deal with. That isnt until June 19th. Financial aid info is in, and when that gets back I sign up for loans. Oy... 

I get paid this week and i am SO glad because I am signing up for the gym again. I can pay 45$ for three months of Gym service, and some money for a transit ticket. I'm happy, cause it means my fat arse can get back to working out :) thank god!"

The towers are cool, but I just don't like the feel of it. Wheeler is where Donny is (I think) But there no alcohol allowed in that building... Umm no thanks. Cobb is ok, it's got 7 or 8 floors. I kinda like the idea of being high up. But I dunno. I might just stick to my guns and stay in North Campus....But they dont have the fitness center.. Grr... The only other part of campus that has fitness centers is East side. I don't know that area well enough.. Dammit. 

I hate decisions. I over-analyze GRRR...

Fuck it... I'll just get pissed off and pick a random place. Hopefully it will work out :D

In the long run I don't care. I want to walk more anyways. I should live in one of the taller tower buildings so I can take the stairs. I've been trying hard to get serious about getting rid of my ass. Last year I was doing great til I lost my job :( Well lets hope that things work out to where I can hit the gym this summer.

"event","I did something the other night that I have always dreamed of, but never did.

But why tell you right away, I should tease a little ;)

Chris and I went to see ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" in Tawas the other day. Tawas is always a magical place for us. It gets us out of the same old same old. I took him out for chinese, since I actualy worked the other day. The play was really fun and the actors are always a treat. I even got to wear my cute new dress and my sorta fishnet nylons.

Afterwords we went to the docks to take a walk (we always do after a play.) It was chilly but we were parked way back so i didnt wanna go back for my coat. We went down next to the docks and stood near/under them for a bit. I took of my shoes and stepped into the water. I kicked it around and danced like a dork. I got Chris to join me. He was reluctant and said ""Maybe nextime.."" I told him he needed to live for today, as if there were no next time. I spashed around with my feet and looked into the dimly lit abyss of lake. I am a waterbug by nature and I get this weird compulsion to dive in whenever I am in water, but I never do. It was so cold on my feet but the water was so beautiful... I decided that I should follow my own advice. I dove in. 

The water hit my face and I swear I saw heaven for a minute. My lungs closed off and I was submerged in black liquid. As I surfaced I realized how far I dove out and how my legs didnt touch ground. I swam back to the shallows and stood up. My nylons and dress dripped the cold water. My makeup was ruined and sliding down my face. My hair dripped hairspray as the curls melted back into my normal hair. My skin was prickling and my god... I felt the most beautiful I have ever felt in my life.

After that we walked along out to the tip of the dock. I was a bit cold, but it didnt bother me. We talked that night about many things and I think dispite our differences I don't think we will be leaving eachother any time soon. He kissed my bare shoulder and my tattoo on my back and it warmed me up. I wanted to cry, because no one has ever really loved me and made me feel full of allure and freedom. He is one of the most beautiful souls I have ever met. It was one of our most beautiful moments together.

 The docks have always been magical...."

I've been kinda emotionaly bi-polar lately. I've been confused when it comes to Chris. Some days he is utterly a doll, but others he is'nt the same. I swear he has twin personalities. I hate talking about relationship stuff. But maybe this will clear my head a bit. I have this thing where if I hear someone say something in a weird way, I get all crazy cause either I don't understand it, or it just feels like it's not right. Ususaly it's nothing.. but it's still odd. I've faced the painfull truth that our relationship will always be more one sided. In my poem I wrote last night I finished with this line. I'm still working on it otherwise I would have posted the whole thing. 

""I always dreamed myself as the starlight in your eyes
where you watch me dancing through the fog of your demise
I take your soul and dance with you in the mirror
and then it's clear that I'm the one in the mask after all these years.""

Yea, if you understand the referance, then it should make sence. But I won't reveal it if you don't see it :)

Eh, enough with that. I've got so many things running through my head and I am tired of trying to ""put things in perspective"" My life is an M.C. Echer print..

I gotta figure out what dorm I am gonna live in. The towers sound cool, but I like the old feel of North Campus. Fuck east and west. Lol.

Haha. I have something embarassing to reveal to you all. I bought some CD's yesterday... I am so ashamed yet I find myself not minding it hehe.
4 CD's of the 90's that I never owned, but always wanted VERY SECRETLY! I am not secretly obsessed.. just a secret enjoier in some form..


My Secret CD Collection








#1 : Christiana Aguilera (First CD)
  
               I forgot how dirty the lyrics were to Genie in a Bottle... kinky. It's so weird to see her now and then. All in all I like this CD. Dispite 90's-esque dance beats and some cheesy lyrics, I sill like it.





#2: Britney Spears - Oops!...I Did It Again

              I could not find her first CD, so I got this one. Yep.. it's catchy. I didnt know she did a version of (Can't get no)Satisfaction. Not sure I'm into it. It's funny to hear ""Lucky"" now that she is all crazy lol.




#3 N*SYNC - No Strings Attached

              I've had the song Space Cowboy in my head all freekin day. Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-ie-ay.... Haha.. wow... I really shoulnt admit that... or the fact that I knew the moves to ""bye bye bye""





#4 Backstreet Boys - Millennium

          

               ......




                                 .............i plead insanity....."

I own a real Ani CD :D We were in Best Buy today and they had a bunch of Ani stuff. I didnt have much cash so I coulnt get ""living in clip"" which is the CD I've wanted for a long while. :( BUT! I got Canon which is a ""best of"" comp from 1990 - 2007 so I am really happy with that. Decree wasnt on there :( but I already have that song hehe. 

I went to JC Penny's and bought one of the most adorible outfits I've ever had. I'm so happy to finaly have this outfut, and I can't wait to see Beauty and the Beast again so I can wear it. Went to goodwill and got everything from a white canopy for my bed (normaly 40-80 bucks, only 3.99) some cassete tapes (including Mellisa E, Music from CATS, Huhey Lewis and the News and some others. Got a dance comp from the 90's CD and bought Man on the Moon ( I Heart that movie) I also got this DVD of this weird ass 80's british show. It's really cool so far lol. It was weird going to Bay City twice in one week lol. I hate it when we spend money down there though cause mom dosent hand me the cash, if theres something I want she gets it kinda thing.. So I can't hold onto the cash and put it towards other stuff grr..

Mom bought a Cd repairer oh thank the heavens I can finally listen to my old CD's!

Not much else going on. Just waiting for my transcripts so I can send in the Ap to CMU. I'm pretty certain I will get accepted. It's just a countdown of til when I go lol. It's almost more important a date of me leaving WB then it is my own B-day lol. I'll finaly be out of here. I won't have to deal with the bull of living here. I'll miss Ash, Chris and a few key others, but hopefully Ash will be working hard towards that Psych degree and Chris will be in a volunteer program. That way I won't feel as sad about leaving good friends. 

(*This part isnt in my myspace blog*) The time will come for me when I am gonna have to make the choice on whether or not Chris and I should part when summer ends. Long distance... I dunno if I can deal with it. I hope that we don't break up before then I don't want to fathom the heartbreak.. but the thoughts of that make me even more sad. I don't want to think about it.. I let myself take this day by day and live for the moment. It's still weird though. Cause so many things seem so right with him that it would be against nature to leave him when I go. Again, I leave the desision to fate and let it be taken however it may.(*This part wasnt in my myspace blog*)


Plus theres always the internet and letters. I think it would be killer if I could room with friends when I go to school. I don't wanna get stuck with some moron or a thief lol. I really hope I can have a pet mouse. I need some animal with me hehe. 

I am listening to Canon right now :D It's good to have some new music hehe. I am uber hyper today. I have that nice inspired happy feel to me. When I was younger I was such a nihilist (i'm pretty sure I spelled that wrong) But now it's like the world is my burrito lmao. (weird al referance) I'm still confused about many a great things. I've got a million and a half things that I'm learning along the way but thats why it's a path through life and not a platform of answers :D

I'm gonna go listen to some moosic and check out some other shtuff before going to sleep.

I mean some of the cast were totaly cheese, but there were some good standing kids. I kept cracking up at the guy who played gaston. He was this dorky sorta pudgy guy, but total charisma!!! Plus he had the voice down. I died laughing cause thats how Chris's voice is! Lummiere was awesome as well. He had that total ""gay french"" thing down where he could womanize and yet be femmy. The feather duster was awesome as well, she had a cool opera voice! 

We ate some really yummer Chiniese food too. We made a meal out of all appetizers!! oh man it was tasty. I got to go to Blue Moon (pagan store) Which I am glad we made it in on time. Chris was over an hour late picking me up (GRRRRR) I finaly addressed that being late is a pet peve.. hopefully he got it lol. 

It was a great evening. We spent two hours on the docks being cold and experianceing that ""close to god"" feeling we get out there. Plus we enjoied kissing on the dock *blush* haha. It was a good inspiring night. It makes me sad I didnt go into theatre. But I guess thats the price we pay eh. Art Education will be funtastic i'm sure. 

I did some groovy Henna tattoo on my hand an wrist. It's a butterfly and some other fun stuff. I took pictures, but i'm too lazy to load them today. I plan on cleaning my room (well, starting too anyways lmao) I plan on selling some things on ebay. My Juicy Couture Necklace for one. Whatever made me buy that thing in the first place. Designer jewelry.. my head was certianly up my ass then wasnt it lmao. Hopefully I can get 50 for it.. Hell 40 might even make me happy. Not sure what else I can sell. Prolly that copy of Harry potter that I have. Some other junk too. I need a yard sale lol. Well I'll donate alot of it.

I applied to Central yesterday. Just have to send in the Ap fee. I'm really sick of this town. I'm ready to be sick of somewhere else lol. CMU is gonna be lonely in a way, but hopefully it will be a little bit more free-ing. I remember how lonely it was when I used to go there. The buildings always seemed ominous, yet still I wanted them.. I'll get to be with some friends and if not, hopefully I'll make some. I also will apply to SVSU and Northwestern. Not really gonna go there, but it might make me feel good to see if I'm accepted lol.

I'm really gonna miss Chris. I pray he gets into his volunteer stuff so he isn't left in WB. I do love him.. I really do. That scares me, but I don't care. He just bothers me sometimes. I can predict him so well that he is never really suprising to me. I'm sure I'm no picnic, but still... I dunno. I try not to let the problems get to me. I guess I do sometimes, cause he always says he has reservations about our relationship. I'm not a fuckin resturaunt lmao. It's hard to think about things like that. It ends up confusing me and destracting me when I should just let him figure what he needs to out. Boys are dumb we should throw rocks at them lol. I'll find a day to talk to him about these things I'm sure... I dunno.. I'm not gonna focus on something I can't control. I need to be there for him in whatever shit he is going through and not focus on the bad. 

Just watching youtube videos and listening to music from the lovely 90's I should post more tomarow. I need a nap right now. I hauled wood all day to get enough money to see Beauty and the Beast this weekend. My body is so tired :( oh vell..

Today was a blast with a capital B. I made it to Medium level on guitar hero !! I tried Texas Flood, but alas Stevie Ray Vaughn is not my play leval yet.

Oh and I hung out with Todd for the afternoon. 

*blush*

Todd is really fun, always has been a cute guy, but I think my crush has gotten the best of me. I was really jealous of Beki, and when I saw that she was giving todd the runaround, my inner fox jumped out. I'm into him. And from the reaction today I think it's agreed. For now, thats all I need. If things progress, fun. If not, still cool. I'm just happy to have a set of non-gay lips to kiss. Especialy since it's a good friends.

I'm a dork *grin*"

I am really freekin trying to get back into the whole ""diet and exercise"" routine. The slim meals and the walking. Drinking more water.. yea the whole shit bit. 
Blarrrrff. I hate being fat. I hate watching other skinnier gals get the good guys. I hate admiting that to myself. But ti's true. 
Now don't get me wrong being a big gal is pretty fun sometimes. I just would like to be healthy. That works for me now :)
Gotta get started on some more art stuff. I need to create a new myspace background and maybe some more icons and such for my amusement. The more the better right? Anyone want an icon. If I get time I'll do one up free o charge :)

i've been looking at Ani Difranco music. I've always liked her, but i've never really dug into it. Now that I re-look into her, I can definately see why Anna would link me to her.

In other news: Gonna send my letter to danny tomarow. I've heard from him through the phone once this summer, he is having a blast which is cool. 

These drugs I am taking for my legs are doing a number on my conciousness. for those who don't know I have this weird thing with my legs thats either alergic reaction or some kinda thing like it, but it's going away now thanks to the druggies. Too bad my brain is going up and down..

You know with like so ""Rahhh"" right now I havent much time for my LJ since all my buds are mostly on myspace. But just for you I copied the blog to put here. sorry it's another schram tale but it's my life lol. 

Oh I am doing work for Zug Izland now. Shweet!


________________________________


What day is it??

huh.. what??

Ohh yea..

 

Schram Show.. what number now 8?? 9? Who the hell cares anymore lol.

Ok, so my two months away from the boys were really starting to get to me. I heard about this show on Tuesday through bulitens and the mystery of it being a secret ""fan only"" show got to me. I saw Molly's buliten and wondered if she herself was going. So, I message her and lo and behold she was. The day before a Schram show, and I can go! Holy Bumcakes and rice!

Anyhoo, for the second time Lyra was gonna suprise the D-town crowd by making her apearance. I got my outfit that was planned for an Old Barn trip out, exited to finaly wear it. Grabbed the drawings I had worked on and put em in my purse. Then made the case to my mom. I said ""Mom I'm going to Detroit, it's an important show, I have money"" She coulnd't really argue.

About 6 the next day, pm mind you. I get a call from Molly saying she'll soon be on her way. Previously that day I bought a brand new phone and dyed my hair. So I was beautiful and equipt with a new phone. Met them got in the car and made our way to The Clem. Every time I hear WRIF I get giddy cause I know I am getting closer to the D. Listened to some good shit and watched some good shit on the way down. 

Then there we were, Mt Clemens. The bright sign on the Emerald Theter Lit up so green it made my heart melt. As we walked up to the entrance I saw the new van. My god was it gorgeous. Got some pictures of that and went up to the entrance. Saw Harmony and Koz and yelled up to Harm

""Fine Harmony, ignore me!"" 

""LYRA!! What are you doing here??""

Got a huge hug from her, but nothing from Koz I was thinking to myself ""you bum"" but I knew he was busy.

Anyhoo got my ticket and found Randy inside as well as everyone else. Got my photo taken like a million times by Spleet and a good hug from him. Suprising people is the best thing in the world. Got alot of ""You're the 'Schram Artist' Right?"" Even met some new people, Like G-man of Zug. He was a sweetheart. Saw Dave and gave him big hugs. I must say his glasses rule. Saw Brian and gave him like 20 hugs in a row, poor guy. Another ""I can't belive you're here!"" from Bri and I went down to get the pics I did for them all. Got a major ego-stroking from everyone lol. As if I needed more eh? Then finaly Koz came up and apologized for not saying hello earlier, called me doll and gave me a big ol hug. I knew he was busy but it still kinda offended me earlier that night, but he made it cool. 

But enough about what I did, it was time for the show!! Well the other band ran over so we had to wait a bit longer. I was already like ""c-mon c-mon!!!"" I'm not the most patient gal in the universe. Finaly the smoke started billowing and my heart started racing. They started out with Mike Steve, and Dave playing some into stuff whilst Brian remained in the back. Then he comes out, the cheers start and on comes Privacy. I can still hear the ""Dah na na na na na na na, na na.."" Of the beginging, and the final ""Laaaa. They echo in your heart at all times. Soon after a quick ""Hello, we are the Brian Schram Band"" (as if they HAVE to tell us who they are anymore) They whipped into Waistline. One after another they knocked back the hits. Bri and Mike climed on the speakers, just as I ran outta film on the first roll. Hope to see what the others captures on that. I know it rocked something fearce.

Then Bri got on the speaker soley again for Everyday Normal. beautiful as usual, Then another soft one, Big Shot. So heartfelt it just makes any girl melt. Then in Schram style went right into Bad Things. And you know I screamed along with the Lyrics. I Am My Own Man came on and rocked like fuck. Then The Finale hit.

One night Stand baby, And we the took it. And although he didnt make us moan we screamed for it! Things went crazy Bri trying to break his fender by lobing it to the ground and only a few chips came off. And, allthough we heard about it comming it was still amazing to see Steves drummallets on Fire. Dear God It ROCKED. I swear that's the sickest drum-solo that will ever be heard @ the Emerald! As the show ended I was awestruck yet again.

Made some goodbyes as the after-party began. Most of us headed to Dooley's for the festivities. This time I was marked with X's so no drinks for me. But who needed that after I was drunk on my own adreneline. Talked to Shelby a bit then Harmony. Then talked to Randy alot. Mike walked up to the bar and said ""hey"" I didnt get to see him @ the Emerald so I thought it cool that he came up to me. Gave him a hug and asked about Texas and stuff. Then Last call came and 2am came soon as well. Gave some hugs to Jersey, Mike and others. The rest of us decided to go back to Casa La Schram. 

What an array of memories I get from the Schram house. Saw Steve when I got there, got to give him a hug, but then he went upstairs. We all gathered on the couches as Brian preceded to watch fishing. M-kay I like to fish, but watching it... no.. The rest of us engaged in conversation on other things as we ocationaly hear the yell ""It's a four-pounder!!"" or, ""Bring it back"" ""Get it!"" ""Oh MAN!"" Belive me it was Hilarious!! After hanging around til 4 am or so Randy finaly got Brian to give in, and so we all went to Stingers ; an after hours gay-bar. Belive me I'd never in a million years imagine going to a gay bar with Brian Schram Band.. All of us got in the van exept Kathy so I gave her a hug goodbye.

It was a cute lil bar. Randy got us in for cheaper. Watched Bri and Harm play darts. Then helped Randy with a match game. Drank too many Vodka Cranberries. Then 5 am hit and it was time to go. Went back to the Schram house and even more fun stuff. Watched as Bri tried drilling a hole in the fridge with a drillmotor, damn he is dangerous!! Don't remember alot but it was all good. Played Euchre on Steve's drum, cause all the furnature is gone.. Drunk euchre is not my thing. Shuffling after cutting the deck putting down the wrong cards.. Yikes lol. Soon after that I think we all decided to crash out. 

Morning.. Ugg.. I didnt sleep cause Dave had the damn blanket and he had a coat on!! PLus there were no pillows on the couch just bri's guitar. So I'm in my lil outfit just about frozen! lol. Got some pics of the sleeping rockstar Dave though. I went to sleep for about a few hours though and when I woke up I found myself cuddled up with Brian's guitar for warmth, so i had marks on my face from that lol. Too bad no one took a picture. How cute/stupid is that shit?

After rubbing my face to get rid of the marks, Eric woke up and then Dave. Soon life began to stir in the house. I gathered up my purse called my mom. I think she knew I was hungover, gotta love her. Then we got ready to go. I knocked on Bri's door and woke him up to say ""bye"" Is that mean? eh, he went right back to bed anyways after saying ""Thanks so much for comming."" Hugged Harmony, then Dave. Then we climbed into the car for the trek home. Stopped to eat and before long I was back home. 

Dropped my purse, hugged my mom, went to bed. 

Another Show down, Millions to go....

Good night and Drive Save,

Gonna start my photography courses soon, so yay to that. alot of silly stupid crap been rolling around, but hey thats the way it rolls. I need something right now.. perhaps a drink?? nah.. just my boys. Well I'll travel further and update you..

Hmm.. No job yet.. Pisscakes.. 

Getting my cash from wolf today, 65$ cool beans! So if schram saturday is in fact a no-go then I'm getting a cell phone. Speeking of that:

Oh If I lived in the hallway of the Wolfman,
I'd have a room of my own
set up in a lilac laundry basket
at night I'd curl up
in the solitary sock and fall fast asleap
in a world of no dreams

But dreams come fast when youre
 sleepin at the bottom of the world..
Cause socks still go missing when you are
 in the hallway of the wolfman.

Oh If I lived in the hallway of the Wolfman,
I'd never go thirsty, 
cause the walls there are stained with Jack Daniels
to honour the dead rock heros
and in the corner there lingers a bottle of Lysol with Lemon
although I can't remember why
and it remains long forgotten
and it remains..

But dreams come fast when youre
 sleepin at the bottom of the world..
Cause smells lack citrus when you are
 in the hallway of the wolfman.

Oh If I lived in the hallway of the Wolfman,
 I'd have parties galore,
but I could only invite one person per night
cause lilac laundry baskets 
are quite small

But dreams come fast when youre
 sleepin at the bottom of the world..
Cause you got invited yesterday
to the hallway of the wolfman

Oh If I lived in the hallway of the Wolfman,
I'd have a room of my own
set up in a lilac laundry basket
at night I'd curl up
in the solitary sock and fall fast asleap...


I like it, i got bored and wolf and I joked about me living in his hallway. Jeez. I swear to christ I need to get outta this town. Perhaps I'll win the lottery and get my outta WB to D-town. And out of kindness I'll get Krys outta Grayling. Two shitty towns in my book. Eh, oh well. At least I'll be getting a new camera ""hopefully"" A Nikon D50 Ooohhhhh, Ahhhhhh.. 

I bought lacy panties, they are nice on my smooth ass, yes ash you heard me SMOOTH! K, everyone else can ignore that lol. Well I better get off this before I reaveal more about my body..

Yay American Idol, go Grey Hair, Rocker baldie, Constantine lookalike, and Donnie Boy.  For the Girls, Go Pickles, Big Lady, and cute lil black gril!!!

Peace out, and Shagri-la awaits us all, sorry I've got zug on the brain"

Life is going pretty alright. I just made 65 off a logo I designed so I am happy. I decided not to go to the show this weekend. I am saving up. I told the boys I coulnt make it. It sucks, but in the long run it's worth it. I'll have $$ saved so when I go down there I'll have some. It's all good.

Hmm.. Lets see. I have been exploring deeper into photogrpahy. It sounds like my kinda deal. I'll keep ya'l updated on that one.. Hmm.. Not much to talk about really. Things have been pretty busy since new years. Hope all you are having a good time.

Ash: Just found out STEPHANE MC MAHHON IS PREGNANT!! YAY!! I went looking at old websites and stuff and it's official she is gonna have a baby. Awwwwww..

Ok back to the journal.. Dammit I cant think of anyhting. I cant go into Schram stuff cause A no one cares on here, B no one knows what its about. soo.. Ummm.. yea..

I have been having alot of dreams about former band stuff. I'm talkin ohhs not schram. I had a weird dream where Donnie and I drove a steamroller through the halways @ solo and Ensemble.. I dunno what the fuck that was about but it was a funny. I am listening to Styx right now so I am too busy singing to think what the hell to write. Gotta love my music..

Alrighty then I better get off here before my brain melts to this thing. 
Have a great Super Bowl Weekend!

"event","I was talkin to Stacy (Mike P's fan) about appartment stuff. I really think I am going to room with her. I mean it's better then a total stranger right? Well we have been talking about it for a while and it sounds really good. She has just about the same ideas on housing stuff as I do. We are going no more then 800 a month on rent. There are some really good places we found for 650 a month (325 a piece) Pretty damn good for my taste. She wants something 45 minutes from her job in flint so for right now we are looking at Pontiac/Auburn hills area. Possibly Rochester or Utica, but I think I'll have more job opportunities in Pontiac. Plus I'll be prolly depending on walking/bus to get there until I get a car. I have been reading up on mixing drinks and things so I might be able to catch a bartending/waitress job.

She plans for July to move. So, I gotta get my ass movin. A couple spots opened up at a local day care here and with my experiance I should be able to get it, got my hopes up on that one...plus I HOPE i get some kind of payment for whatever goes in the Schram album. I have to talk to Mike about that.. I'll keep trying to get a job. I want to have at least 3 months rent + 500 for expenses when i get down there. All the furniture and stuff is taken care between us so I don't have to worry about that. But I want to have at least that amount (about 1,600-1,800.. ok lets just say two grand) so I can get a job and have a back fund in case things don't go well the first month or so. Sounds good in theory, let's see how this pans out he he. I have major hopes for it though. I wanna keep it going. 

I really don't know much about all of that. I mean I live in a small community.. *Bleh* So this will be great for me mentaly. I think with the moving out I will be more free. Sure, i'll have way more responsibility but maybe thats what I need? I dunno, Am I crazy? lol.

 Me and stacy were talking about how we would break it to everyone. We would suprise people by me showing up @ Dooley's one random night. The boys would ask how long I was staying down here for. I'd tell them ""As long as you want me, I live here now"" and laugh. Then go ""suprise!"" Shock the hell outta everyone he he he. And no, I am not moving down here for just the boys. I am moving for the art connections, the possible jobs, and the freedom from this crapshack. *Sigh* It may be a dream but G-dammit I am bound and bent to make it come true!

G-night all :)"

She has a really cool blues/country sound. I am not a fan of country but she is pretty good at making me like it. She is on No Deal Records so thats cool. She is unbef-inleavable with her voice!

Hi Lyra, 

Of course I remember you and the bracelet. Sorry I don't really wear bracelets or any other type of jewelry or ""bling"" at all but I thought you'd appreciate me wearing it the day you gave it to me. I'm pretty sure I kept it though. It's good to be on myspace because it gives me an opportunity to network with friends I don't normally get to talk to. Kinda puts me back in the ""loop"" so to speak. I joined the ""I miss Joe Jermano"" group. Is that your baby? I sincerely appreciate the sentiment. Now that I'm on myspace feel free to leave me a comment or send me a message when you wish. I've become quite addicted to this site. 
It took me a while to get on my feet after the whole Schram debacle, but fortunately I have a great girlfriend who supports me in many aspects including letting me live with her. We've become very close soulmates as a result and I don't remember ever being this happy. I'm now teaching guitar as well as playing in HOSE. I'm also getting back into Guitar repair as well and my financial situation has finally taken a turn for the better. 
I'm sincerely thankful for all the love and support I've recieved from all my fans despite my absence. I'm back with avengence though and it won't be long before you'll be able to see me at a show. I believe our next show is Feb. 24 at Scores(somewhere near 15 mile and Ryan). We are still tossing around band names because we aren't 100% comfortable with HOSE. As soon as we decide we will be able to create our website. I'll be sure to make sure you get on our mailing list. 
Well that's it for now, take care Lyra, hopefully I'll see you soon... 

big hugs for you... 
Joe

It's about dammed time!!! I just was so shocked to get this. It just made my damn day. For those who don't know why... you havent been reading my journal. It is so odd that Jason leaves and all of a sudden I meet Justin Headly, and Mike Dunbar (former BSB memebers) And now a message from The guitar hero himself. cheri keeps saying things happen for a reason.. Hmmm I am starting to wonder if maybe she is right...

PLus that show Feb 24th.. Schram should be releasing the album around then.. *Grin* I might get to see Joe sooner then I would have thought. Only time will tell though. I can't freekin wait to see what these months hold!!! Also, I am so happy to see things are going well for him. How rockin!

Alright I better get off here. Have a good day everyone!!

"event","I heard the greatest song last night. I fell in love with it instantly. It was accidentaly placed with other songs that I got from Jason. He must have accdentaly put it along with the other songs long ago and by the time he got the folders to load them for me, it was in there.. It is very ironic that it was this song that slipped in. The past few days I have been feeling so lost and regretful. This whole thing with the band missing a piece is crazy. Plus, now some of the fans are turning on me becasue I have to move on with the band and draw things with the new guy.. Its all a mess and I just wish it was 3 months ago.. I was uber depressed and I get on my computer to listen to the music I had gotten. This song came up mixed among the others. It is by Stereophonics and it is called Rewind. The lyrics are this:

STEREOPHONICS LYRICS

""Rewind""

It's your time
It's your day
It's never too late
To change lanes
How's your life?
How's your place?
Was it where you wanted
Your head to lay?

But wait, you can breathe
You can see what I can see
Don't waste your time
You can't make back

If you could rewind your time
Would you change your life?

Do you like you?
Do you love your wife?
Or did you pick what
You're told was right?

Dream and be
What you feel
Don't you compromise
What you wanna be

'Cause change is okay
What's the point in staying the same
Regrets, forget what's dead and gone

If you could rewind your time
Would you change your life?

If Jesus rode in on a camel today
With your cross on his shoulder
Time to take you away
Have you done all you wanted?
Are you happy and warm?
Do you miss someone special
You don't see anymore?
Have you blood on your hands?
Do you dream of white sands?
Can you sleep well at night?
Have you done all you can?
The place I was born in
Stays crooked and straight
I see innocent blue eyes
Go blind everyday

Rewind your time
Would you change your life
Today?


I love Irony... it's beautiful..."

"event","Saturday:

I awoke in the bed I fell asleep in. It wasnt mine, but at least there was no one next to me. I slept hard that day about 10 returning to my own room. I slept some more. Donna came in and said she was going out. I wasnt hungry. I was just exhausted. I needed to fill up. I slept longer and longer. It got to be later still. I woke up and felt good again.. It was 7:04. The same time the day before when I wrote my song. It was enough irony for me to wake up. I got dressed again. I put stickers all over my shoes to make them look cool. I was feeling more full and I was getting closer to feeling everything was going to be ok. 

I walked back into the barn. And as the night before I sat at the table and awaited the band to start playing. I looked around for J, as he said he would be there.. but he wasnt.. I let it go..

I watched the faces through the crowd the lighting up of everything. It was so full. I let my mind wander and found myself walking into the music. I was back at the begining for a second. Then I was back to the present. I realized that in a way this was a begining. It was a new year, a new sound, and it was all a begining. There was no time for guilt.. no time for regret or sorrow. It was time to start anew. And so right then I let my new year start. No countdown required, I just walked into it and was there. The show was amazing yet again. 

Everything was on. 

The afterparty was fun. As they usualy are. Jumping on the bed, signing picture frames, and whelies on bikes. Random things that make my memories happy. It was back to normal.. or maybe it was me that was normal again. I went to bed this night and had so many dreams. The morning would come and I would be whole.

Sunday:

Sunday was a good day. I was up and feeling good again. It was a typical sunday at the barn. I saw the back of a head and a jacket that was familiar too. It was J. I thought I was going bonkers but lo and behold it really was him. I hugged him and went back to my table. I talked to Jersey and Donna. I enjoied my breakfast and watched as the band loaded out yet again. I said goodbye to J and the others and did not shed a tear. Life would be better. The album is comming out in a month or so. There are new opourtunities for me in the art world and things just looked up. 

I looked at the stage one last time... it was full. Full of memory and greatness. It may have been free of wires and guitars and things that are placed around.. But it was still full.. For when you have memories you hold true in your heart.. nothing is empty...  and it is all going to be ok...

The End"

"event","As the new day arose I woke tired and still empty inside. I moved around the house. The light was faded and everything just blew by me. We all had to go to Dooley's to load up the equipt before the trip to Grayling. The sky was overcast but it didnt suprize me for some reason. I just waited about and sat quiet while they loaded. I watched as the pieces were taken off of the stage leaving it empty.. I sympathised with it. It too was being left empty on the Friday afternoon. 

I went and started up the van. J came out the door and I walked up for a hug. He said he would be @ The Barn on Saturday for a minute. I just gave a simple hug and just was quiet. I climbed into the ""Schram Van"" and sat amongst the debris. This van was full.. I'm not sure of what but it was full. I was jealous of the van. Randy drove through the streets on our way to pick up someone of all people, Dave. He lives on Thunder Ridge. Which in my mind is sort of cool for someone who plays bass to live on a street with Thunder in the title. Makes sence. He pulled in and with that same friendly face said ""Hello."" I was again ashamed of my previous bias against him. I began to chat with the man that I had so neglected to speek to before. Brian strummed a bit on the guitar getting lost in music, me getting lost in my mind. Who knows what would happen along the way. We  stopped to pick up Mike and Jersey the van was even more full. Grayling was hours away. And I was still empty. 

As the hours progressed and the phonecalls ended everyone went to sleep. I woke up quickly and looked around as we were at a gas station still 2 hours away from Grayling. I got something to drink. Then everyone went to sleep again. It was dark and quiet, empty but peaceful. Brians guitar laid on the floor of the van. I without any thought picked it up. It was light and free. The strings were perfectly tuned and I just started playing the notes I knew. It was quiet so you could barley hear anything. I didnt want to wake anyone up. It was strange as I started playing this guitar. I had seen it so many times that it was so farmilliar. I started writing a song. I was filling myself up with music. It was a chipped guitar, filling me up with its song. The dark road shone on as the signs got closer to out destination. It was Friday night, 7:04 this place was farmilliar.. had I been there before??

I climbed out of the van a little more optomistic. My new song ringing in my mind. I was so inspired by what I had created on a hero's guitar that I barely spoke to Donna. I just wrote in my idea book. I was filling up so fast that the ideas just poured out. I got into the shower and hummed the melody in my head. I put on my outfit for the night. I was still half empty but I was ready for what was to come.

Walking into the barn, a sight that always brings cheer. It was just different. I mean the tables were the same and the lights were all together.. but something was there.. or maybe it wasnt. I shrugged and sat down. Only minutes to go and I was just blank waiting to be filled with the band I love.

The show was amazing. As I looked at the faces on stage it seemed as if they shared the same half empty look. They looked free. They were together and blending so well I wanted to die right there. I was feeling so guilty that I wanted to leave. But, I had to move on... The guilty was filling me up though making me cry again. I don't know what is worse being full of guilt or so empty it hurts...

I went into my change purse to pull out cash to pay for a drink when I remembered thats where I put J's necklace. I stopped crying and looked at it. I went over all reasoning in my my and let the guilt slip away. Yes I would miss J dearly but I had to go on with the band. It was my dedication that brought me this far. It was my love that got me this far into the band. And I could not just keep locking myself in the past. I tucked the broken beads away and danced away to the music. I emptied back out but filled myself up with the music that I heard. It was the best I have ever heard the band in my life. I really did want to feel guilty but I pushed it away. Everything happens for a reason. So I watched as the colour returned to the stage. The last set ringed on and I felt almost full. Lost, but almost full.

We got back to the afterparty and I drank too much. I was so battled with leftover emotion and I just drank. I got all happy and stupid as one does whilst drinking. I spent a good hour in the evening sleeping on the bowl. Not my proudest moment but a lesson in itself. I passed out on the bed. The covers were warm and welcoming."

"event","Hey guys I'm still comming down from this insane week. Man oh man. Remind me why I drank so much on friday?? Lol. I forgot what I was like drunk (its been while) but hey it was all fun. Shit where did I last leave off?? I dunno I'll just do Thursday on.

Thursday (Jason's last show)

Prelude:
I knew this day would come it was weird to perpare for it. I thought my goodbye would have been on Sunday morning but the plans changed and so it was Thursday. The day before I hung with him alot. I was in his computer room and I complimented his necklace. He had a couple of wires acting up on him but it looked ok. 

Story:

Ok now that you know that back to Thursday. I packed up my stuff from Cheri's to put in Donna's car that night. I got all dolled up and ready for whatever would happen. Cheri and I were pretty quiet.. It was just an odd moment with J leaving. I would have new people to meet that night and one of them would be Dave.. J's replacement. 

With a mind ready for anything I walked into the place called Dooley's a place famous for Schram Thursdays.. I was there. The stage was set.. I was ready for anything... 

Saw J and pushed hard against any urge to cry. I gave him my gift. A picture of John Lennon mixed with the Imagine memoriam I bought in NYC 4 years ago, along with a poem I wrote for him. He put the photo atop his speaker and loved the poem to death. The first step toward the cliff had started. I met many faces I had only seen in pictures. Steves brother Johnny, Photo Kathy, Jodi (another photographer) and There was the final one. Dave Dion.. Double D as some called him. With all the bias I had against him it was weird to walk up and want to hate this man. He had a naturaly friendly face. Without introducing myself he caled out my name, and hugged me deep. Two more steps towards the dropoff. 

With Crown and Coke in my stomach I picked up a pen out of my purse and grabbed a cocktail napkin. I scrawled out a cartoon of Dave. I still am not sure why it was right then I chose to do it. Was it guilt for trying to peg this man before meeting him? Was it a welcome gesture? I'll never know myself. But as I handed it to him I could feel the thoughts in my head slipping away. I wanted to puke. I felt so disloyal to J at that moment. I could not think of what to feel. Then the next set started up again. The last set... The... Final set. I was pretty good through it to be honest. Sure my eyes were swollen but I wasnt breaking down.. then I heard that farmilliar twang of the guitar.. which will forever twang in my mind.. the Last Master J performance was only a few minutes from being over. For those who dont know what ""Master J"" is I'll tell you. It't Rappers Delight by the Sugar Hill Gang. But when Jason Price does it Its ""Master J"" As that song played I was running toward that cliff in my mind. Everything was rushing so fast. And then.. It happened. Weather it was dream or reality I was back to the begining. It was mid july and ""Weedman"" was rapping it out. It was like nothing mattered but the notes in my mind. The tears flowed and I watched as the bar was transfomed into that hot summer day. Back to the begining. But before I could stay there to long it was over. And there I was at the very end of the cliff... back at dooleys.. and the show was over... I stepped up on the stage, and off the cliff. I broke and every tear in my body came out. I fell right into J's arms. Crying out and falling fast into the unknown. But J held me and said it would be ok. He thanked me for everything and kept telling me it would be ok. I pulled away finaly and looked around. The perfect stage from minutes ago was cracked. The bar was darker. The sound was muted.. I breathed deep and looked back at J. His necklace had broken, and so had my soul. 

I walked away from that stage not having fully rid myself of everything. I said some goodbyes. Then I saw Dave again. For some reason I walked back up to him, now more hopeful...

 He said ""Thank you"" again for the drawing. I replied ""There will be more to come"" I breathed again... and fell the rest of the way. This time landing in Dave's arms. He told me it would be ok. and I just let all emotion flow out. I wanted to be rid of all that was inside. I stood around for a moment more. I went and got a chair and retrieved the broken necklace that was flung to the rafters. I don't really know what it symbolises in my mind but I know it carries a great meaning to me. So I pulled it down and held onto it. I was empty inside. But, ready to move on. I gave one bead off the necklace to Cheri, afterall if anyone should have been saddened it would be her. I said goodnight to her and rode along with Donna.

Out of either craziness or fate I came back to that house for the night. Brian was already drunk, and it was quiet. Little by little people came to the house. Including J. We all went from room to room hanging out. I smoked a bit with Jodi and Steve. It just would not fill anything up. I was still empty but I was alive. A treat came when J brought Justin to the house. Justin was a former BSB drummer whom I have only heard about. We all went from room to room and the night went by like that. I got to hear J play piano which was weird that I didnt know he could. It was really good to hear. Music always takes me away. The night winded along further and further. It was finaly time to go to sleep. J offered me his comforter and I went to sleep on the couch. I closed my eyes still empty. ""Perhaps"" I thought ""Morning will be better"" I closed my eyes and dreamed of no one."

"event","Went to schramms again today.. Man ... What fucking controversey.. Lots of stuff which I cant talk about but I will say that it revolves around J.. Cheri would kill me but I do side with bri, although I love J to death. Tonight will be J's last performance with BSB. He will be going into ""The Flask"" which is what he wants so i am happy for him.

But I dont wanna go into the BS of the day. I'll go to the fun stuff. I got alot of good pics today. Fresh out of the shower J & Steve. I would have got bri when he came out but I was saving film. I got to really talk to J today which is really cool, yet odd. I got a set of gifts from him that I cant tell yall about (dont think pervy) But I will listen to them for while. Oops... lol.. Its been an odd day.. Talked to bri for a while too. Its so weird that I dont think of him as BRIAN SCHRAM anymrore, the crazy rodie/lead that I wanted to do abd things with.. He's just Brian, or Bri.. nothing more. Weird how things change like that. Got some really cute candid pics at the house. Like one with steve and the bottle of mnt dew. I WISH i could have gotten this pic of bri going up the stairs with a drill but I wasnt quick enough. Its so cool being @ the house and the memories I have gathered in such a small time. I feel so ""at home"" there. its like they really enjoy me there. After hangin @ the house we decided to go out to New Way in Ferndale again. Palyed some pool and listened to a fairly decent blues night. Bri tought me the night befoer how to play pool. He is really nice when I fuck up. ""Good try sweetie"" or, ""That was a good Idea"" It was nice of him. But I know I shal never be a pool master. He f-in rocks @ it!! He is good @ Fishing, basketball and pool. At least we know bri can do other things if the music dosent go. 

Got to see Steve's video from him in a band in 1989 FUCKING HILARIOUS. Also got to ""rock the Gange"" with Jodi and steve. So far this week Lyra has toked up with:

YOu ever have someone tell you something you dont want to hear cause you cant repeat it.. Welp.. it happened today. It involves BSB... *Sigh* This is the second time this has happened so you all can guess what it is but I cant say anything till its official and this thing happens. 

I'm going to stop having favorite things in my life....

But you know what... I am still going to have a great time. Live for the moment. Live it as if it were your last, or theirs... 

Soo.. Happy New Years Everyone! I hope all your dreams come true!"

"event","My Resolutions for 2006:
1. Eat healthier. (notice how I don't say lose weight.)
	Note: I don't mind being big anymore. I have accepted this as a fact of life, and I am very positive about the way I look. I do however need to cut down on energy drinks and carb stuff. I owe it to myself as a treat.
2. By my 19th birthday I want to be living in Detroit.
	Note: Honestly i wish it would be NYC but, my art connections are here. Plus, Schram every Thursday, and its Detroit Rock City, how could I refuse? I plan on leaving right after band camp of 2006. I could see all by buddies and all.
3. Go to KCC for the summer, for one class. Get my refund and get a used car. Also, get own insurance policy for that car. Also get a licence to drive.
4. Obtain a job and raise up at least 6,000 in the bank.
	Note: This is so I can build back up funds. I hope to have more then that, but I had to leave it at a small number.
5. Get a design job in d-town using my connections..
6. Get 300$ up to go to Chicago.
	Note: I wanna go to Chitown with Krys this summer and go to Fearless Radio. It's not the NYC trip I wanted but still it rocks hard core.
7. Help BSB achieve stardom.
	Note: Like they need any help.
8. Get laid. (Yup, I said it. These are my resolutions afterall.)
9. While in the process, don't change, never grow old, and stay the same quirky self that got me this far."

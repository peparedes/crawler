"event","Finals are finally finalized and finished. I have beat both prince of persia games that I own ... again. Had almost as much fun as I did the last time I played them. Very enthused. And I will have the third one in less than week. This last one promises to be just as angsty and violent as the last two. Yay. I bought another hardbound volume of ultimate spiderman. Even though I've already the comics as files I had lots of fun reading them in my hands. I no longer care if any of you cares about me reading comics. They are a lot of fun. Overally life is going well. I was able to get rid of the bug that was on my computer. So now I can surf the web and such without fear. I got a fairly big check from work so I am not worried about my finances as much anymore. Yay.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a sadder note the buffy game kind of went downhill 2 weeks ago. So that wasn't as much fun as it could have been. So I have higher hopes for this game coming on friday. I'm planning on mapping out my character's mansion on sims 2. It'll give me something that I can point out to the other players. It also gives the GM a chance to have things happen there which would be totally awesome. I haven't been able to hang out with my friends severuslvr and titianbishi like at all. I think I'm going to try and go and do something all three of us in the near future. <br><br>I'm really starting to miss lair. It's really kind of dissapointing.

"event","You need a little background information in order to truly understand this

My grandma has a spoon collection. This collections has been growing for about ... 20 some odd years. See every time someone sees one of those decorative spoons they think of my grandma. The spoons are only like $2 so they naturally buy it. Well the only problem is that my grandma has no way to display them anymore because her original spoon rack has run out of room. So I decided that a good solution to the problem would be for me to make her a new one in my woods class.

So I just barely finished it before christmas break. It took me 3 off periods and 3 lunch periods on top of regular class time to get it done. But I did in fact get it done. I sent it off and christmas day my grandma called to tell me that she was ecstatic about it. This was probably the best gift I received.

Overall I didn't get anything of note. But hearing my grandma loved my creation was very nice to hear.

"event","<P>I refuse to write another ""my life is shit listen to my problems post"". Not to knock people who do that. I think release is important. It's just high time I did a different type of post.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I have come to a great gate. It is covered in pens, papers, complex equations, startrek memorabilia, star wars memorabilia, comic books and the like. As of a couple days of ago I am officially a card-totin' member of the geeks (and to top it off I actually know what a geek is) I bought some comic book volume thingys after I had finished this research thing. I was asked a 1001 questions about sprite. The sound, taste, image, appearance, desirability, carbonation, you name it. and for my boredom I was rewarded with fifty dollars. Within a 1/2 hour I had decided that I would really enjoy reading some comic books and went to a little store I knew about in downtown. Then I bought two HARD BOUND volumes of Ultimate Spiderman. I spent my reward and then a little bit in those two purchases. Pity me for I am weak. </P>
<P>I have stepped through the gate. I can see the star trek esque force field barring me from the realm of simply weird. My mother was actually kind of upset that I had spent the entire amount so quickly. </P>
<P>I am also a nerd. I finished hamlet as part of a class. I am about to read it again so that I can really understand. Plus I'll get a chance to memorize fun quotes to confound random people. ""methinks the lady doth protest too much"" hee hee </P>
<P>Those of you that remember my car problems should note that I am finally getting my car back. Looks like new. It has had a fairly sizeable dent in the front hood for nigh 4 years now. Never interrupted its ability to drive. Then I got in a bigger accident. Well then it had to be fixed. Luckily my trust fund came into save me and paid for the repairs. <EM>Thank you great-grandfather in your inifinite wisdom for creating such a fund for me!</EM></P>
<P>Biology is becoming very enjoyable. I actually look forward to walking into class to learn about different body systems. *rubs hands together*. School is looking up. I'm starting to actually fall into some sort of routine that works well for my school schedule. Up until this semester I've kind of run around like a chicken with its head cut off. So coolness with that.</P>
<P>Went to see Narnia. *does a little dance*. Enjoyed that movie so much. I nearly peed my pants. (I serisously had to go near the end of the movie.)</P>
<P>The only sadness in my life is that I spend all too much time by myself instead of with friends. This is partially to do with the fact that some of my friends are not easily reachable. Also that I don't have all that many friends. </P>
<P>I miss my best friend <lj user=""severuslvr"" /> . I don't know if I just don't catch her. Or whatever. Until I am spoken to differently I suspect she simply spends a lot of time with her boyfriend. I'm glad that they are happy and can spend all that time together. Still me and <lj user=""titianbishi"" /> are reporting feelings of neglect. So that ends my post. I feel better. Go this stuff.</P>

"event","This last couple of weeks have simply sucked because I can handle. I had to make a presentation of sorts for my spanish class. I also have a presentation tomorrow for a different class that I am not prepared for. To top it all off my mom got a blood clot again. In the same leg again. Because she spends too much time sitting ... again. Then this morning I'm going westbound on 72nd and what happens ... I get in an accident. So Here I am seriously thinking suicide would save me from all the homework that has surmounted itself upon me. Seriously I wrote a poem to deal with the emotions (mind you it felt good to write it but in hindsight it really has no goodness as a poem). So I find out that it is going to cost over $3,000 dollars to completely repair the car. Now I must admit to one of the few good things that has happened. I will probably not have to worry about those $3,000 because my wise, wise, wise ... wisewisewisewisewisewise Great Grandfather had the foresight to create a trust fund for his only month old great-grandchild. So my car will be fixed I will flunk out of my academic program but in the end I will still have my car. That makes it all well. Sorry that I never post except when something is horribly wrong in my life. It just helps to know that people that actually matter in the grand scheme of things have heard my little problems. Oh and ben feel better man.

"event","<P>Life is in a general sense not very congruent to summer at this point in life. This is my last real before college summer. I'll probably be working like mad or just stressing out in general next summer and I wish I could enjoy this one a little bit more. </P>
<P>Things to accomplish before school starts (late august) </P>
<OL>
<LI>&nbsp;write a 1000 - 1500 word essay entirely on arthritis found in dogs </LI>
<LI>&nbsp;volunteer for at LEAST 75 hours of community service. More if at all possible </LI>
<LI>&nbsp;read a book like 2 and 1/2 inches thick </LI>
<LI>stop having insomnia </LI>
<LI>&nbsp;have some fun if I can </LI>
<LI>vegetate whenever possible </LI></OL>
<P>Well this is much longer than I would have liked. I just really want a chance to recharge my batteries for when school rolls around. I don't think I'll get the chance to play football because of the fact that I just went to morning workouts and I almost failed like two classes and actually failed spanish second semester. I hate this whole situation it just stinks. Why am I up right now writing this. Well the fact is when I start stressing out I do something that I don't know if a lot of people do. I don't eat a whole lot. I don't just take off in the middle of the night. I just kind of sit at home and don't sleep. I surf the internet, do e-mails. Just kind of waste as much time as I can manage. Then I go to sleep. In the school year it went something like this. </P>
<OL>
<LI>Don't sleep because of stress</LI>
<LI>fall asleep in class because of lack of sleep</LI>
<LI>grades slip because you miss pieces of subject matter</LI>
<LI>stress out because of slipping grades</LI>
<LI>return to step one</LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On a good note I have gotten more work this last pay period than ever before. I am looking at a paycheck of at least 200 dollars. Which to my poor self is simply huge. Although basically until a week from tomorrow (today in 8 minutes) I have all but like 9 dollars promised to someone. Whether it be what I pay my parents every month or the 25 dollars I owe my sister or the cost of going to charlie and the chocolate factory (not required but I really need one of my movie nights with jo and michelle). That leaves me basically broke. Eh I spent 16 years in a constant state of broke why should it bother me now. Damn economy has poisoned my mind. </P>
<P>Also the next zelda looks like it is well honed and concise (in comarison to the last one which really downplayed the kind of angst that really made me love the ocarina of time game. Can't wait till it comes out in november</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Oh and welcome to friday</P>"

<TD>You're hotter than, well, hot-cakes! You've got a fan base bigger than Pam & Tommy, and to tell the truth, you actually don't mind the super-hero gig. Most of the time, anyway. Everyone seems to love their fun, friendly and courageous hero as you swoop in to save the day, time and time again! Unfortunately, swooping and day-saving doesn't help pay the rent, and you're not exactly the ""hero-for-hire"" type either. Hey, at least you can play down the whole life saving, self sacrificing gig with some neat lil' punchlines and remarks! Juggling both egos becomes a strain at times and whilst you want to help everyone, you're also in search of ""me time"", often finding yourself having to make constant personal sacrifices in order to protect those around you. Don't fret though! At the end of the day you'll find yourself with the support from either those you rescue or perhaps a close friend or loved one who'll get you by, reminding you of how cool you look in spandex. </TD></TR>

"event","So in case anyone didn't know my dad slipped and fell while we were in spain. The stairs were kind of wet and well after we get back and a little procrastinating from my dad he goes in and finds out that he has broken his foot in two places.

Last friday he went in for surgery which has basically left him bed-ridden until like tuesday. So until then he needs people such as myself and my mother (however my sister is yet to notice that her helping out would be great but anyway) to go and get movies and books and food and all the other essentials of life. So until then I have been allowed the most infentissimally small glimpse into servitude. So right now I am venting.

My car is costing me loads of money. Money I do not have. Then I will be paying my parents off for the next forever years. Until then there is nothing I can do except toil away at chick-fil-a until I pay them off.

Which leads me to my next point. Terry Gist is my new operator. He officially leases the chick-fil-a inside of the westminster mall. The problem however is that he doesn't really know what he is doing. He has never worked in any sort of food business. Before this he was a real-estate agent. He tries really hard but he has some qualities that make him especially hard to work with. When he runs into a problem he tries to fix it in a very odd manner. He simply makes up a new rule. For instance some people were taking brownies as part of their break meals. Well I guess brownies are more than terry can really afford to allow us to take on break meals. Now there were some other instances where people would take more than they were supposed to but that has always just kind of been a part of having teenagers your main source of employees. So instead of talking to those who are part of the problem he puts into effect a new set of rules which are really limiting in what you are allowed to get.

There are just a lot of things going on in my life that are just not bill friendly. It kind of sucks. Anyway I'm looking forward to vampire already. Hopefully everyone will get to meet my new character and hopefully some guests if I can manage it. With that I leave you to your own devices of torture in your own lives.

"event","Guess what I found out today.

Well first you need some background information.

It all begins about 6 months ago with my parents deciding that I needed some new tires. So they went to the tire place and the guy there informed them that I was in need of an alignment as well as new tires to make sure that the tires lasted as long as possible. So we go to the place and not only does it need an alignment ($45) but also something else costing me something like 500 dollars or something. Then they tell us that something else should be repaired in about three months just to make sure. So we do what I suppose we had to do at the time. So began my debt to my parents. I currently owe them something like 1200 dollars. This is before what just recently happened.

So the other day me and my dad are driving to see the war of the worlds (excellent by the way) and as I'm pulling up behind a car at a light I decide that I would prefer to be in the right lane. I go through all the proper procedures (quickly mind you but I did them) and I begin the process and all of a sudden it felt like the front right tire seized up and we came to a stop. Now at first I think that we ran into something. There are definitely no cars around. I have my dad look out the car. There definitely isn't like a dog or anything under the wheel. So we back up and then the car goes forward just fine.

We go to see the movie. Enjoyed it greatly. We leave. No problems on the way home. Just a little bit of a squeaking noise as we drive. So we decide that we need to take it in shortly. Well what with the holiday weekend and all we decide that we can't really take it in until today. So we take it in explain all the problems we had. And leave it there.

I go home hang out a little bit. Watch a movie. Then we get the call. Guess what? You're breaks are toast. Apparently it wasn't the front right wheel but instead the back right wheel. Also the brakes weren't just broken. They were shattered. So I definitely have to have new brakes installed. So yay for me I get to shell out another 400 dollars. Or rather I am in debt to my parents for that much longer.

What really sucks is that regardless of the fact that I am making regular payments to my parents and definitely above the minimum. None of this will show up on my credit report so that when I do need to borrow money it will be that much harder.

Sucks to be me

"event","Well I have recently had the opportunity to purchase the game called pikmin. This game is possibly the most addictive game I have ever played. I have played many games. This is by far the most addictive. Despite the fact that it is ridiculously easy. At least for me. I remember the first game of pikmin I ever played ended with the main character not achieving his goal of returning to his home planet. It was quite odd. INSTEAD of the main character dieing. He instead is picked up by the pikmin then put through a process that makes more pikmin. Then a pikmin that looks very similar to the main character pops out of the ground. It was really weird.

Now the real question comes from what planet exactly are we on. Many of the creatures that you encounter on this game have similar traits to animal found here on earth. However there is nothing like them on earth. The thing is you find bottles and boxes and other items distinctive of earth.

I am fairly proud of myself. When the main character's ship crashes 30 crucial parts fall to the planet separate of his ship. Then he finds out that his life support system that is a part of his space-suit has only enough power or whatever to last 30 days. So ideally you should get one part a day and you will be more than ok. You only need so many parts of your ship in order to take off. I have never taken the time to find out how many that is. Each part is slightly distinctive. Some don't seem like you really need them. Other's you simply can't take off without. Well here is the thing. Just because you have 30 days to do it doesn't mean you shouldn't go ahead and get several parts in one day.

So I have been playing a game where i get several parts a day whenever possible. So at one part I had 5 parts left to get and 15 days to get them. At the very end there is a huge boss that is near impossible to beat. So after I got all the other parts I decided that it was time to amass a serious amount of pikmin.

Well those of you that have ever played the game know that 100 pikmin is the most pikmin you can have in the field at any given time. I have almost 900 pikmin in this game. 500 something red pikmin. 211 blue, 215 yellow. Or something like that. Anyway I still have like 9 days to amass more pikmin. Although I will probably not even come close to using them all.

Well I believe that this is the longest post that I have ever made. You also might care to notice that this post is also properly punctuated and makes fairly good grammatical sense."

"event","So as the title would suggest someone within my family had a run in with blender recently and I can tell you that the blender got away with all my mother's money. We called the police but they said that they couldn't arrest a blender for assault. If they arrested the blender there would be an uproar from the appliance rights committee.

Well basically what happened was that my mom decided that she wanted to have a smoothie. She knew full well that the blender was in the process of meeting final death. However a smoothie sounded sooo good. Seeing as it was monday and very very hot. She simply had to have a smoothie.

I decided that I would rather go upstairs and fiddle around on the internet and with the sims 2 and whatever else struck my fancy. So everything beyond this point is what I've heard from her and speculation. Also the way the blood splattered gave me some clues.

Anyway so my mom starts to make the smoothie and she puts in the ingredients like any other smoothie. However the blade doesn't quite spin fast enough. Therefore it leaves many large chunks in the smoothie. I suppose it would have been called a chunky. So she decides to take the ingredients out and without actually removing the power fiddle with the blade in an attempt to free the blade of any hindrances. So after fiddling with in removing something and then putting it back on. My mother decides to turn it on, mind you she did not actually like leave her hand on the blade (it was dumb, but she's not THAT dumb), the blade popped up and decided to bite her left index finger.

Me being upstairs I hear

1. the blender turn on promptly followed by
2. crashing, banging and a large gasp from my mother
3. the blender continuing to run
4. My mother yelling, ""Bill Help""
5. The sound of my heart pounding

So I run downstairs, almost tripping twice, to find my mother tightly grasping her finger. So I have come to the decision that my mother has severed her finger. So I am in the process of searching the floor for her finger so that I can grab it and wrap it in ice and take her to the emergency room to get it re-attached. She says, "" I cut my finger"" and I respond, ""OFF"". She tells me no and so she grabs a towel wraps her finger in it. We go to the emergency room. She was cut from her finger tip to just after the second knuckle crease. Amazingly enough her main tendon was left unscathed and she is expected to make a full recovery. However she did need about 6 stitches. I'm not positive but I think it was six. Something like that, the lady who stitched her up was very thorough. 

While this was definitely scary somehow or other I maintained my cool. Only once when I had to call my dad to tell him did I find myself stuttering and searching for words.

The thing that pisses me off though is that my sister is acting like nothing ever happened. She doesn't go out her way at all to help my mom out. She doesn't treat her any nicer. 

NOTHING


ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

My dad also hurt his ankly while he was in spain and now he is in a lot of pain and he limps pretty severely. Once again my sister seems unaffected.

Well that is all I'll rant about tonight

"event","O.K. tonight was father's day. So naturally similar to mother's day (though not as much hype) one should go out of your way if at all possible to make sure that your father knows that you appreciate him. 

My sister does not grasp this concept. Today she was the bitchiest she has been in weeks. I don't know if she is just hormonal or what but damn was she in a bad mood. I got the distinct that she was having one of those teenager moments where you are angry and not quite sure why. This is why I'm leaning towards the hormonal possibility. 

It was ridiculous. Were in the car and she outright says that she hates me and my dad's personalities. No tact about it. ""I really hate your guys' personalities"", these are the words my sister has for my father ON FATHER'S DAY.

*Deep breath*

I'm glad to be back from spain. No more euros. Most of the television is in english. People don't give me funny looks as I walk down the street. I don't get the distinct feeling I am going to die while in a vehicle on the streets. Overall I am definitely glad to be back in the US. Still this shit with my sister is simply ridiculous. 

*Deep breath*

Well I am looking forward to vampire. *Rubs hands together* I have a new character. That's all you get to know. Can't wait to see all of the people that I have been missing. Though be warned as I am a poor High school student I am without souvenirs. So don't expect any."

I'm starting to get tired of work. I mean it's better once I get their because then you just work and then when you're done you're done. Making money is nice though because now I can like actually get people stuff and its not that big a deal if I get them something kind of expensive because in a couple of months I'll be back at where I am now. so three cheers for employers. Well the randomness is subsiding so with that see everyone later

"event","Today at work was a crazy day. it was a saturday so naturally we were crazy non-stop. Insanity was around every corner. So I'm finally done with work so I decide to just hang around a little while and buy some ""icedream"" its like a mix between ice-cream and frozen yogurt I think. Anyway so I'm hanging out with people who are on their break. at the end of the break my two managers start to like get into a fight and one calls the other a something ""control freak"". well to put it mildly this worries me. Oh bother, *goes and sits on thinking log*. Theres this girl thia at work. she's really nice and like a piano prodigy. I'm not sure if she has any sort of thinkings about me as a possible like dating thing or since we work together that's is even an option. Confusion and chaos reign in my mind

"event","damn you jigglypuff. How you torment my soul to its utmost crevice.

     I have been playing the game Super-Smash-Bros. Melee for the past... two hours. trying to beat like thirty jigglypuffs in a row with one life...

NOT EASY

Moving on. School stressing me out. Job more stress I could do without. Other people in my life causing issues. Life simply is not as fun as it could be. I'm up this late at night. 1. nothing better to do 2. I never have the option to stay up except on weekends. 3. I get a chance to surf the web for the sole purpose of surfing.

ramble ramble ramble ramble

ha ha i've said everything I need to say.

*creepy voice from AOL says* ""goodbye""

"event","<P>So this is a livejournal well we'll see what happens. this seems like a good cahnce to try out my poetic legs and if they be useless, well, there are more embarrassing ways to find out. so I'm going to write now and thats the end of the beginning.&nbsp; </P>

<P><FONT size=4><STRONG>well do you</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>do you know if there is a <EM>you.</EM></FONT></P>

<P>This was inspired by Shakespeare's othello as my lit teacher talked about how we never see who Iago really is and everything he does is just an early reaction to what other people might do. In fact he has no self. Then this leads to depressing thoughts about self-worth and things like that. So that's the beginning we'll see where this goes.</P>"

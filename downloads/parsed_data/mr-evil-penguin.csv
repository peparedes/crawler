 MieL771 [4:48 AM]:  you'll never set it off   
 Path of Orion [4:48 AM]:  why not?   
 Path of Orion [4:49 AM]:  i've had them go off because i had a tack in my shoe before (stuck to the sole)   
 MieL771 [4:49 AM]:  unless you put a gun or a knife through it.  you'd be draggin on the ground if you had that much metal.

 MieL771 [4:49 AM]:  gross   
 Path of Orion [4:49 AM]:  i'm draggin now!   
 Path of Orion [4:49 AM]:  lmfao   
 MieL771 [4:50 AM]:  guys are so proud of themselves.  but only gross girls like that stuff.   
 MieL771 [4:50 AM]:  peni are not the most attractive part of the male anatomy.  its not like it needs decorating or to be bigger than your leg or something.   
 Path of Orion [4:51 AM]:  lmfao   
 Path of Orion [4:51 AM]:  relax, chill out   
 Path of Orion [4:51 AM]:  i was kidding   
 Path of Orion [4:51 AM]:  not about wanting to decorate it or get it tattooed   
 MieL771 [4:52 AM]:  i'm not uptight...i'm just sayin....   
 Path of Orion [4:52 AM]:  you are uptight   
 Path of Orion [4:53 AM]:  i'm laughing my ass off over here at your reactions   
 MieL771 [4:53 AM]:  i was just sayin.  but thats cool.   
 MieL771 [4:53 AM]:  i don't think i'm uptight.  but i don't care if you think i am.   
 Path of Orion [4:54 AM]:  ok   
 Path of Orion [4:54 AM]:  i want to know how comfortable you are with yourself   
 MieL771 [4:54 AM]:  i'm comfortable with myself.   
 Path of Orion [4:55 AM]:  do you masturbate? 
 MieL771 [4:55 AM]:  don't need to   
 Path of Orion [4:56 AM]:  why not?   
 MieL771 [4:56 AM]:  because i don't.     
 Path of Orion [4:57 AM]:  are you single?   
 MieL771 [4:57 AM]:  i'm single   
 Path of Orion [4:58 AM]:  and you don't masturbate?   
 MieL771 [4:58 AM]:  i don't.

 MieL771 [4:59 AM]:  lets see   
 MieL771 [4:59 AM]:  a little over 3 years now   
 Path of Orion [4:59 AM]:  wow   
 Path of Orion [4:59 AM]:  have you had sex in that 3 years?   
 MieL771 [4:59 AM]:  nope.   
 Path of Orion [4:59 AM]:  wow   
 Path of Orion [4:59 AM]:  i feel sorry for you   
 Path of Orion [4:59 AM]:  how old are you again?   
 MieL771 [5:00 AM]:  22

 MieL771 [5:00 AM]:  i'm happy.   
 Path of Orion [5:00 AM]:  are you a nun or something?   
 MieL771 [5:00 AM]:  nope.  but i am waiting until i get married.   
 Path of Orion [5:01 AM]:  are you a virgin?   
 MieL771 [5:01 AM]:  i am.   
 Path of Orion [5:02 AM]:  wow   
 Path of Orion [5:02 AM]:  i'm impressed   
 MieL771 [5:02 AM]:  :)  thanks   
 Path of Orion [5:03 AM]:  i kinda wish i was still a virgin   
 MieL771 [5:03 AM]:  really?

 Path of Orion [5:04 AM]:  yah   
 Path of Orion [5:04 AM]:  i feel like a wh0re   
 Path of Orion [5:04 AM]:  but then again, i plan on covering my body in tattoos also   
 Path of Orion [5:04 AM]:  lol   
 MieL771 [5:06 AM]:  i have 5 tatttoos so far....but i don't see where that's related really.  do you really feel like a whore? 
 Path of Orion [5:06 AM]:  yah :(   
 Path of Orion [5:06 AM]:  i want from my ankle to my shoulder   
 Path of Orion [5:06 AM]:  i want to be able to roll up a business shirt and not have anything show   
 MieL771 [5:07 AM]:  you better have a lot of money   
 MieL771 [5:11 AM]:  well....you know...if you stopped now...and waited until you were married....you'd be like a renewed virgin.  but that would probably be too hard.   
 Path of Orion [5:11 AM]:  lol   
 Path of Orion [5:11 AM]:  hell yes, it would be hard as shit   
 MieL771 [5:12 AM]:  you couldn't do it huh   
 Path of Orion [5:12 AM]:  can i add you?   
 Path of Orion [5:12 AM]:  i don't know   
 Path of Orion [5:12 AM]:  i don't think sho   
 Path of Orion [5:12 AM]:  i'd need to have a strong woman   
 Path of Orion [5:12 AM]:  and i'd probably still masturbate   
 Path of Orion [5:12 AM]:  altho i haven't done that in like the last week   
 Path of Orion [5:12 AM]:  i've got too much nerve damage, i can't get ""it"" up   
 MieL771 [5:13 AM]:  seriously?   
 Path of Orion [5:13 AM]:  unfortunately   
 Path of Orion [5:13 AM]:  2 herniated disks lumbar spine   
 Path of Orion [5:13 AM]:  they say things are supposed to be all better when i get it fixed   
 MieL771 [5:14 AM]:  well....now's as good a time to start as any   
 MieL771 [5:14 AM]:  :)   
 MieL771 [5:14 AM]:  i hope that it does get better for you   
 MieL771 [5:14 AM]:  that does not sound like fun   
 Path of Orion [5:14 AM]:  it isn't   
 Path of Orion [5:26 AM]:  well   
 Path of Orion [5:26 AM]:  since you've grown quiet, i'll leave you be

We wait forever, not knowing when it will happen, but it's an eternity in and of itself, the next thing never comes, people never come through, and of course, life goes on. I wish i could sit alone until the end of time, just watching and waiting for the next big thing, but i cannot, it drags me down mercilessly, the world. I'm sick of everything, i'm sick of people, i'm sick of being alone. Have you ever had that feeling that no matter what, your life was worth nothing? That nobody would even notice if you died? I know that my mother wouldn't know for months. My father would only find out if my mother called and told him.
As i sit here and think of all i've accomplished in my life... I wonder if anything i've done really matters to anyone else? I sit here and wonder if my tears were worth it.. if my pain and suffering helped anyone else, if there was anything i could have done to make myself remembered. I wonder if there is really anyone decent in this world."

by this
world of agony
world of spite
world of ignorance

i fail to find the answers

more questions

locked away from the world
the young boy runs
away
to his special place of safety
far away
from reality of all things
the one he wishes to avoid the most

he runs up the mountain
to sit upon the overlook with his wolf
beautiful wolf
she doesn't exist but in his mind
but he will love her until his death
she will save him from the ghouls
she will save him from the ghosts
she will save him from the skeletons
in his closet
locked tight deep inside that beautiful mind
he keeps his secrets safe
they aren't to be trusted
he tells himself
to run around loose

he wanders down from the house on the hill
to the top of the bluffs overlooking his bay
he hears the gulls caw the roaring surf crash
he feels the wind and the cool bite of the spray
he knows here is home and will always be
where he will come to escape
tho it is only
still in his mind
here is his special place
his place where he's safe."

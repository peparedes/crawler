"event","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Internet bloggers should enjoy traditional press freedoms and not face regulation as political groups, lawmakers and online journalists said Friday.

In separate letters, Democratic lawmakers and Internet commentators urged the Federal Election Commission to make sure that political Web sites that serve as focal points for political discussion, like Wonkette.com and Freerepublic.com, don't have to comply with campaign-finance rules.

""Curtailing blogs and other online publications will dampen the impact of new voices in the political process and will do a disservice to the millions of voters who rely on the Web for original, insightful political commentary,"" said the Online Coalition, a group of bloggers and online activists.

Fourteen members of the House of Representatives said blogs foster a welcome diversity of viewpoints.

""This 'democratization' of the media is a welcome development in this era of media consolidation and a corresponding lack of diversity of views in traditional media outlets,"" said the group, which consists of thirteen Democrats and one Republican.

The FEC ruled in 2002 that Internet activities do not count as ""coordinated political activity"" and thus don't have to comply with laws that regulate money in politics.

But a U.S. judge struck down that ruling as too broad last year, and the FEC is scheduled to consider it later this month.

If the FEC determines that online ""blogs"" are in fact political organizations, they could face fines if they work too closely with political campaigns by, for example, reprinting their press releases.

FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the commission would try to craft its new rule as narrowly as possible.

""The Commission has tried very hard for a long time to be as limited in its regulation of Internet activity as it possibly could, so there's no reason to assume that that basic orientation doesn't continue,"" he said."

"event","It's the 11th. Seeing it on my phone is eerie and as I just brushed my teeth before bed I thought of all the people two years ago who did the same thing, not knowing that in a matter of hours they would either lose their life, or have a loved one lose theirs. I am getting up in the morning to watch them have the memorial at The trade center site. Although I know I will cry and it will hurt, I want to see it.  I haven't decided what I will go to tomorrow around Savannah to commemorate it. I get out of school at one, and might go to a memorial downtown. I'll just see how the day goes, and where I feel I need to be. I know I already feel thankful for my life, and those I have around me. I hate it that it always takes a horrific thing to make me really realize how lucky I am. I wish I realized it everyday when the little stuff begins to eat away at me, and the smallest things seem life altering. Wow, two years already. It seems like not so long ago, yet seems like a lifetime.  My friend Daniel's birthday is today. Somehow on a day so full of sadness and death it makes me smile to remember through his birthday that this day also brings life."

"event","Just got back from seeing it and feeling kinda down. I had intended to see the movie with some friends but they all either didn't respond or couldn't go, but in the end I'm glad I saw it alone because it's a private experience.

Here be major spoilers:

<lj-cut>At the moment there's nothing in it that REALLY annoyed me, and apart from PS and DH1 that's unusual for me. There's usually something. Some things were changed, but nothing jumped out at me like, ""WTH?""

They killed off Griphook and I think Lavender too (was it Lavender that Greyback killed?) but I can live with that as they are minor characters. 

My favourite bits were in there: Neville killing Nagini, Molly's ""Not my daughter you bitch!"", Hagrid carrying Harry.

I loved Luna's, ""Harry Potter, you listen to me!"" and McGonagall directing the troops (especially her gleeful, ""I've always wanted to use that spell."" Lol!)

I was slightly disappointed with the bit where Harry talks to Ron and Hermione before going into the forest. There was emotion but there should have been even more, especially from Ron who didn't even hug Harry or anything. There was just a look between them. They should have tried to stop him more, needed more persuading.

Neville's speech was good but I think J.K.'s version of him shouting, ""Dumbledore's Army!"" was better. I wish they'd had that line in there.

But, of course, the best thing in this movie in the end was Snape. Alan Rickman was fantastic! There were several bits I cried at - Snape's death, Fred's death, Remus and Tonks' deaths - but the saddest bit of all was definitely when Snape found Lily's body. Alan did that so perfectly and to see Snape, this character who's usually so together, fall apart like that was so powerful.

During the opening it felt slightly strange to think that I was actually watching a new Potter film, but I've had that feeling with past films too. The epilogue, as with the book, made me uncomfortable because I don't like flash forward epilogues that show the child characters all grown up. I don't like to imagine them any older than their twenties. Thematically I see that the epilogue was a good idea, it's just a personal preference. And when the credits started rolling I wanted to cry about it being over but didn't because I was in a public place.

I expect I'll see it again soon. I always need two viewings to really get a sense of the Potter films. It didn't feel like two hours and ten minutes at all. I'm feeling more anticipation towards Pottermore now. It was a smart move really on Jo's part, announcing Pottermore before the movie came out, because it helps to stop it feeling like it really has ended. There's still one more thing to look forward to anyway. :) And hopefully there'll be A Very Potter Threquel. And who knows, maybe she'll write something else. Whether it's Potter or not, I'll read it.

Edit: I've just thought of something. I don't think the movie explained why Harry could choose to go back after being killed by Voldemort. Unfortunately I may have to take back what I said about there being nothing in this movie that really bothers me. I can't stand plot holes.</lj-cut>

Let me know what you guys think of it when you've seen it."

"event","Tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock I will be sitting down at my local cinema, with a full audience by the looks of their website, to watch the last ever installment of Harry Potter. No more books, no more movies - or at least not unless J.K. revisits it in the future. It's been one heck of a ride and Harry Potter has become a major part of my life, and I hope will continue to be so. I will await the launch of Pottermore and hope that there will be more things to anticipate in the future, whether that includes a new book or not. If there is another book I want it to come about because Jo had an idea that she just had to write, not because she deliberately sat down to think of a new story because people were clammering for it. I think the difference in quality would be noticeable. (I just hoping that Pottermore is not going to be instead of the promised Scottish book.) To my LJ friends, all of whom I have met through Harry Potter, it has been a pleasure to know you and while I don't comment much, or post much to my own LJ anymore, I do check my friends list on a daily basis.

All that remains is to wish you all a very happy Harry Potter viewing, hope that the movie won't disappoint, and to make sure to read (and possibly write) plenty of fanfiction in the future to fill the void. Be sure to post your thoughts on the movie once you've seen it.

Happy Harry Potter Day everybody!"

"event","In case anyone hasn't heard, MTV are doing a Harry Potter World Cup, a competition to find the Greatest Character (basically a popularity contest). If you haven't been voting get over there now: http://moviesblog.mtv.com/tag/harry-potter-world-cup. It's the second stage of voting at the moment.

So here's the controversy for those who don't know: Luna lost to Narcissa in the first round. Now Narcissa has fans, no doubt about that. But Luna is one of the most popular characters in the series. She only lost be a fraction of a percent, but surely anyone who knows the fandom should know that that result should not have happened. The thing is that voters knew that the winner of the Narcissa/Luna poll would be up against Cedric in the second round. So the conspiracy theory is that Twilight fans voted for Narcissa in round 1 so that Cedric would have an easier time in round 2. It's getting a bit fandom wanky.

A lot of fans are now voting for Narcissa, trying to knock Cedric (and the Twilight fans) out. At the moment though they're failing, Cedric is in he lead, and there are a lot of Potter fans in the comments saying that they loved Cedric before Twilight and want him to win for genuine reasons. I'm with them. Out of Cedric and Narcissa I would much prefer that Cedric won and to my mind the current result is what it might well have been without the controversy. However I still find it difficult to believe that Narcissa genuinely has more fans than Luna. As I say, she appears to be one of the most popular characters in the fandom.

Whoever wins this round will go up against either Hagrid or Lily in the next round. Neither Narcissa nor Cedric should beat either of them really, but the worry is that if Twilight fans are rigging the contest then they'll force Cedric through that round too. I'm torn! I do wish though that the whole Potter/Twilight rivalry wouldn't come into these things."

"event","I'm avoiding spoilers but I've heard from people who have seen the test screening that the last 30 mins or so of the last movie has a LOT of changes from the books. I read someone's comment just now that this was disappointing for them and now I'm worried. Is it going to be little changes or is it going to be major changes like changing who lives and who dies, or messing with the themes, or major plot alterations? This sucks cos DH Pt1 is, I think, very faithful to the books, definitely more so than PoA or GoF, and it had moments of brilliance.

Not automatically. With younger children yes, but teenagers have free will, they understand morality and the consequences of their actions, they have a lot more people influencing them than just their parents. Children don't know better, teenagers do. It may be the parents' fault, but we can't assume that."

Oh boy was 2010 a life changing year for me. My mum died, I moved out of the house where I grew up. And at the end of the year I am still jobless. So not a good year for me. Here's hoping 2011 brings more joy. Not that nothing good happened in 2010. I recently attended the Snow Ball in Edinburgh, a festive WizardRock show, which was AWESOME! Especially when we all sang Don't Stop Believing, which apparantly they did at Infinitus too. The musicians were brilliant - Riddle TM, Romilda Vane and the Chocolate Cauldrons, Siriusly Hazza P and Swish and Flick all the way from the US. The other attendees were great fun. And well done to Neil who organised it.

And of course I have my own place and independence now. Here's hoping that next year I'll get a job."

"event","I started watching Buffy today, which I've never seen before. Now I don't normally like vampires but that's because I don't like all this dark romance stuff, with killer!guy who we're supposed to find hot anyway and who gets the girl wanting to be bitten, a la Gary Oldman's Dracula. In Buffy the vampires seem to be fully acknowledged as evil, full stop. Don't correct me if I'm wrong, I'm already really enjoying it and I don't want to know what happens.

Here's two Potter meme questions - I missed one again.

<b>5. Wizard Rock. Discuss.</b>
<lj-cut>Better to listen to played live in my mind. There are some really good songs and bands out there, like the Deathsticks and Riddle TM (I've heard them both live twice) but if the songs are amaturish then the main appeal of them to me is going to an event to listen to them with other fans. I wish there were more Wizard Rock events in Britain. :( When they say every flavour they mean every flavour...</lj-cut>

<b>6. Your favourite character(s)</b>
<lj-cut>Ron! Always been my favourite right from the get-go, but then I usually like the funny best friend best. Sirius always used to be my second favourite. And I love Harry of course. Of the girls possibly Luna, but gotta love Hermione too. Favourite teacher is McGonagall. Best lines, seriously.</lj-cut>

And now, I gotta go to bed cos I got food shopping, housework and job applications tomorrow. I'm sure I could think of more enjoyable ways to spend my Saturday."

"event","<b>4. Your favourite movie</b>
<lj-cut>Order of the Phoenix. With the exception of the flying down the Thames scene (in front of any Muggle on the embankment, looking out of their window or on the boat Harry almost hit and then flew right past the lit windows of), there are fewer things in that movie that really bug me. And there are bits that I just love, like the emotional range of a teaspoon scene, detention with Umbridge (the expression on Harry's face as he looked at her), the Dumbledore/Voldemort fight and when Harry repels Voldemort. I love the music too, although I also love the Chamber of Secrets music."

"event","But on the plus side it means I get to do two Potter questions at once. :D

<b>2. Your favourite book</b>
<lj-cut>I think at first Prizoner of Azkaban was my favourite, at least partly because Sirius was my second favourite character. Actually I think it usually topped the polls on people's favourite. But now it's Order of the Phoenix. It was the first one that I waited for and anticipated, it was the longest (I would have read a Potter book the size of the Encyclopedia Brittania - still would), it was the funniest in my opinion and the darkest until that point. I loved CAPSLOCK!Harry because I love angst and quite frankly his anger in that book mirrored mine in reading it. Oh how I loathed Umbridge! How frustrated was I by Dumbledore and the other adults! You know most people would give up a secret once the person they're hiding it from knows that there is one. But I love to be wound up by a book. Jo has a wonderful ability to make the books dark and emotion-inspiring without making them depressing. And on top of all that it had some of the best lines of the whole series - most of them coming from McGonagall, but the twins, Harry and Ron get some too. I think probably the one part of Melissa Anelli's book Harry, A History that annoyed me was hers and her friends' negative experience of reading that book and their predictin that the fans wouldn't like it. The favourite book poll on Leaky Lounge says otherwise - last I checked Phoenix was in second place. So neh! ;)</lj-cut>

<b>3. What house would you be in?</b>
<lj-cut>I am a Hufflepuff through and through. I'm not courageous like a Gryffindor, although I have discovered that I can be sturdy. I consider myself fairly intelligent but I'm not really one of 'wit and learning'. And I'm definitely NOT a Slytherin! Probably the opposite of one actually. But I am very, very loyal. I'm just, patient (depending on what it is), I believe in equal opportunities and treating everyone the same like Helga did when she said, ""I'll teach the lot and treat them just the same."" And really, I think kindness is one of the most under rated traits.</lj-cut>"

"event","A Very Harry Potter sequel's out!! I was more excited for this than I have been for the last couple of movies and was up late watching it the day it came out, but I haven't had a chance to post anything about it until now because I have been busy. I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to the original but it so totally did. I think once I have it from itunes Harry's song about home will become my new favourite. It was really moving and encapsulated the themes of the series so well. Overall, the play was just utterly hilarious! And I love Ron so much! I have come to the conclusion that the only people who can do Harry Potter [i]really[/i] well are Jo Rowling and the fans. And certainly fans are the only ones that can do good satire of a thing.

One of my favourite TV couples is severely losing popularity among its fans, and just when I'm thinking about that the ice cream van comes into the close and he's stopped doing the ice lolly I've been buying from him almost every time he comes around since I was little! I've posted before about how this keeps on happening to me - EVERY food product or dish that I like eventually disappears from the shelf or restaurant that sold it, and there's only one reason why they would take it away and that's lack of call for it.

I've had to put up with this my whole life and I'm SICK of it!! I'm sick of foods I like disappearing, I'm sick of being made fun of for my interests and disagreed with over my opinions. I'm sick of Luke/Noah fans becoming Luke/Reid fans, I'm sick of girls who like bad boys and guys who insist that we all do, I'm sick of Twilight overshadowing Potter, I'm sick of trying to get my Facebook friends involved in a cause or group and getting absolutely no response, I'm just SICK of all of it!!!"

I can't believe she won't be on PotterCast anymore or the PotterCast vlogs. Hers were always the best. I hope she'll still attend fandom events."

I'm posting this from my new NOTEBOOK COMPUTER!! I can access the internet from anywhere in the house! I can do my writing anywhere in the house! My mum got it. She said she wanted to get me something special since I've been thrown in at the deep end with her health. So I'll be using this for work and my desktop computer for play (this one can't play games). The pain in her arm thankfully wasn't so bad yesterday, and it's not too bad so far today.

Tomorrow I'm going to go up to go see my best friend and her family. I'm looking forward to it."

"event","Gina_r_snape asked me Five Questions. If you'd like me to ask you 5 questions, post in the replies. Then update your journal with the answers to the questions. Include this explanation in the post and offer to ask other people questions.

<b>1. What music are you listening to these days?</b>
Mostly soundtracks. I've been listening to the Half-Blood Prince one and a lot of Disney. I go through phases of listening to one CD or a type of music.

<b>2. Do you still visit the Lex? How is it over there?</b>
I do but not as much as I did. The most active threads over there seem to be the You Know You're A Harry Potter Fan When thread and the games threads.

<b>3. Who else from the Lex are you still in touch with?</b>
Everyone on my friends list was on the Lex. I'm also still in touch with Phelim McIntyre and Julie Holden, two of the UK Lexers.

<b>4. If you could travel to any place, money no object, where would you go?</b>
Two things: Florida in 2011 so that I can go to both LeakyCon and the Harry Potter theme park, and also I'd do a round the country trip of the UK with a small group (preferably containing Amercians because all the tourist stuff is always much more fun to non-Brits) and stop in each English county plus Scotland and Wales.

<b>5. Are you planning to do anything for/with your mum at Christmas?</b>
We're going to try and have as normal a Christmas as possible, though I doubt that it will be normal."

"event","You know, sometimes I wonder what the odds are that one person should be different in so many ways. It's against the odds to be different in one way, but in so many...

Ways in which I am different:

1) I am British and don't drink tea (the average Brit drinks six cups a day)
2) I don't eat chocolate (!!!)
3) I don't eat pizza
4) I don't eat most vegetables
5) I don't think vampires are sexy
6) I don't think bad boys are sexy
7) I don't swear
8) I don't drink alcohol
9) I have never smoked or done drugs (including cannabis)
10) I have always tried to be good and don't find rebelliousness appealing
11) I am shy (less so now but I have been in the past)
12) As a teenager I was never desperate to grow up
13) I have always liked kids things like Disney
14) Although I would like to meet someone I have never met anyone who I've been properly attracted to, and so have never had a boyfriend and am still a virgin at 23
15) My food tastes must be very unusual because whenever I like something from a supermarket or restaurant sooner or later they drop it (I'm not exaggerating, it happens almost EVERY time, the most recent one being that the restaurant stopped doing steaks - STEAKS for crying out loud!!)

I'm sure there are others but I can't be bothered to think of any more. It doesn't in any way bother me that I have the above traits (except maybe number 14 because as I say I'd like to find someone), I like being those things. I just wish more people were. In what ways are you guys different from the masses? Does anyone here share any of the above traits?"

"event","The laziness problem is plaguing me today. The washing up has gotten on top of me and there's dinner to make. There are three options for dinner, two of which require preparation and the third requires a baking tray that I'll need to scrub first. The third option is also the least healthy. Plus my brother will be round in about half an hour and if the washing up isn't done I'll get a lecture about mice (we've had them before). Hormones are probably making it worse today but I can't explain that to him either. And the more stressed you get the lazier you get."

"event","I got a letter in the post from my local hospital and thought <i>this</i> must be the results of the blood test and probably a letter telling me to anticipate the one I've already got (late post). But it wasn't, it was a letter about another test they want me to have, this time an abdominal ultrasound. Which makes me think that the blood test didn't show up anything and now they're testing me for anything and everything they can think of that has at least one of my symptoms. I don't mind the ultrasound so much, it's the other one that bothers me, the idea of having a cannula put in my arm. The thing is both these appointments are very early in the morning which means my brother needs to come over very early to stay with Mum and make sure she gets her breakfast and pills and everything. Twice. This test is this coming Sunday.

According to the net abdominal ultrasounds are used to evaluate the kidneys, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen and abdominal aorta and other blood vessels. It can diagnose abnormal liver function, enlarged abdominal organs, stones in the gallbladder or kidney, neurysms in the aorta, clots, narrowing of vessels and tumors.

Come to think about it I'm worried about that now too. Although I can't see that I have any symptoms of any of those conditions so I don't know why the doctor has ordered it. At least the other test might explain my weight loss."

"event","During the summer I was referred to the endocrinology department at the hospital because a blood test I had said I had mild hyperthyroidism. I didn't get an appointment until October. I had to have another blood test ten days before seeing the doctor and this one showed my thyroid is fine (though I may be prone to thyroid problems). But my symptoms haven't gone away. So he ordered some other tests to make sure there was nothing else wrong. I had a chest x-ray (for the shortness of breath and the pounding heart) which showed nothing wrong. I also had an ECG which showed nothing wrong. And then I had a blood test to monitor my hormones (for the thin hair). At the weekend I received a letter with NHS on it and thought it must be the test results. It wasn't, it's a letter saying I've been admitted for a Short Synacthen test in December. I've looked it up and Short Synacthen tests are used ""to diagnose or exclude primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, Addison's disease and related conditions."" Looking at the list of symptons the only ones I seem to have are weight loss and possibly dizziness, which I only have on occasion. So I don't know if this test has been ordered because the blood tests did show something or because they didn't show anything.

The test involves a cannula in the arm through which they'll take a blood sample. Then they administer a shot of something or other and take two more samples after 30 and 60 minutes to test my body's reaction. After that I can go home.

As I said in the title of this entry - [sarcasm]great![/sarcasm] Now I have my own health to worry about as well as Mum's."

I haven't heard my voice recorded for years. I know that the last time I heard it I didn't sound on tape anything like how I did in my own head, but it didn't really bother me then. This time it did. I'd never heard the voice coming out of the headphones before. This is the voice I'm going to have for most of the rest of my life, unlike the one I had as a kid which was only temporary. It's not a bad voice, it's just unfamiliar. It actually unsettled me but I'm getting used to it now through continuous playbacks. You can hear your own expression in your voice, it's just the voice itself. Makes you wonder what it's like to me an actor or a singer... or a mimic! How do mimics know that they actually sound like the person they're doing?

My actual voice sounds less deep than the voice I hear normally, and posher.

It's a scientific phenomenon of course. Most sounds you only hear externally, your own voice is heard internally too, through vibrations in the jaw. Or something like that."

I've done my room today and dad has done the kitchen, though neither are done fully, and the rest needs to be done too. I've sent an email to a professional cleaning service that do one off deep cleans. If they don't charge too much I'm going to argue my case to Dad and James. I think it'd be a well worth it expense, especially as it will make daily and weekly maintanance much easier. Just washing up and wiping down the surfaces each night, and then once a week giving each room a vacumn, dust and tidy, doing the laundry, and maybe putting some bleech down the toilet. Anything else that needs to be done will only be an occasional thing. It's a sensible option right?"

"event","I'm an opinionated person, but I'm starting to grow weary with arguing with people. Not good when you want to be a columnist, or when you want to try and make the world a better place. I'm also feeling very negative about how possibe making the world better is, and about the point of debate or discussion. I've just been talking to a person on IMDB who believes that because the show Merlin (have you guys from America seen it on NBC?) has Gwen as a black girl working as a lady's maid that the show is racist. She will become queen later. And Merlin is also working as a servant and from a poorer background than Gwen. And the Merlin world portrays other black people as knights and noblemen (a fact that half the board is complaining about, saying it's historically inaccurate - even though the film's producers have said that they deliberately made the world fictional rather than historic, for creative purposes to do with costuming, architecture etc). As far as this person seems to be concerned portraying a black person as a servant is racist and reinforces stereotypes of black people as slaves. (Not the same thing!)

White and black people will never be equal until they are treated equally in the media. Deliberately going out of your way to portray them in a positive light in order to avoid accusations of racism is not treating them equally. It's patronising. Reminds me of that bit from Scrubs where Terk had a flashback of being given first prize at the science fair at school, and saying to his mother, ""But I didn't even enter the contest!"" and her telling him to shh. :)

Maybe I should know better by now than to try to discuss controversial issues with people since it bothers me so much, but I still have an opinion and a desire to help the world, and my logical brain is trying to fight the emotional view of all people with a negative opinion being idiots beyond reason, because my logical brain knows it's not fair."

"event","I haven't updated in a while. The convention seems to be making progress. We're having our first meeting online because not everyone is free to meet face to face and we can't wait any longer. So we've set up a chat room. That should be tomorrow if all goes to plan. Then we can get this party started!

Speaking of parties, there's going to be a Potter-themed Christmas one in Edinburgh this year. I'm a little bummed that someone else has thought of Edinburgh (that's where we're planning) but it's not at any of the venues we're looking at and it's a different kind of event. I'm not sure yet if I'll be going, because of the travel, but I certainly want to. Riddle TM are playing like they did at Hogwarts Jamboree."

"event","<lj-cut>Carrying on from the attack at The Burrow.

Lavender gives Ron the necklace - snerk! I'm so glad they kept Won-Won in there. Ron was appropriately awkward.

As I said before I liked how teen Riddle looked like an older version of Hero Fiennes. I also liked his manner. The way he moved and talked made him seem like he'd stepped out of Poirot or something from that era, a proper English gentleman. I liked how he said, ""Intuition."" You got a real sense of his canivingly manipulative nature.

Watching the film I was struck again by how stupid Harry's first attempt to get the real memory out of Slughorn was, using the same lines as Tom Riddle. Of course that was going to freak him out! It was the same in the book. Slughorn's reaction though, the look on his face when he realised Dumbledore had put Harry up to it, seemed genuinely hurt. I felt sorry for him.

Ron under the love potion was hilarious! I've seen the bit in the dormatory before, but not the bit in Slughorn's office. Hugging Slughorn and falling off the back of the sofa was brilliant! Well done Rupert! Well done with the fit too. Collapsing was funny but the fit itself was most definitely not, with the foaming at the mouth, the rolling eyes and the convulsions. Very well acted indeed on Rupert's part.

The scene in the hospital wing - oh the scene in the hospital wing! ""There, see, he senses my presence!"" Lol. ""Ah to be young and to feel love's keen sting."" *grin* I wonder how the teachers in that scene felt to be watching the fight over Ron. Rather awkward I should think. And the way Lavender was staring at Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall afterwards was hilarious.

But then Tom Felton stole the show for a while when he came in and saw Katie. The look on his face was perfect! Like he was terrified. The crying in the bathroom was totally realistic. Harry should have registered more shock at seeing him like that though, like in the book. In the book when Draco attacked him it was like a paniced defensive reflex, but in this it was more, ""I hate you!"" Still the fight scene was really good, and I liked that they had Sectumsempra hit Draco off screen. That was a good way of handling it. I expected to see blood floating in the water like in Jurassic Park. :D But they didn't show too much blood until Snape started healing him, which perhaps made the sight of blood less bothersome to young ones by the fact that it was receding rather than spreading. Harry seemed genuinely sorry for what he'd done and genuinely in shock afterwards. And the counter spell that Snape did was good.

I'm not sure yet how I feel about Ginny taking Harry to the room of requirement and hiding the book herself. On the one hand it was sweet and romantic. On the other it could mean that Ginny will have to go to the RoR with Harry in DH to get the tiara, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. If she simply accompanies the trio there then fine. But if she goes instead of Ron and Hermione, that's what I'm not sure of. She'll be the one involved in the feindfyre incident and there'll be no line from Ron, ""If we die saving Malfoy I'm going to kill you."" Then again knowing how the film makers treat Ron that line probably won't be in there anyway. Grr!

""Did you and Ginny do it?"" Snort!

Harry's sarcasm and arrogance under Felix might get on my nerves later because it's out of character, but for now I think it's hilarious! ""Sir!"" ""Well then by all means come along sir!"" LOL! It could actually have been one of the funniest bits. Harry did seem quite unfeeling at times under Felix though, but then he kind of did in the book too. I LOVED the story about the fish though. So sad! And did anyone else think that the way Harry said, ""poof"" sounded more like it had a different meaning then when Slughorn and Hagrid said it? *giggle*

There was a moment in Dumbledore's office that I liked. When he showed Harry the horcruxes and Harry touched the ring, there were tears in Dumbledore's eyes, like that was the moment that he realised for definite that Harry was indeed a horcrux. He probably already strongly suspected but hoped that he was wrong. Given that, they chose a good moment to put in the conversation between Dumbledore and Snape (which I'm glad was in there). Dumbledore had probably just told Snape more of his plans for after he was gone, in the light of his realisation about Harry. Dumbledore's excuse about why he can Apparate out of Hogwarts was weak. I thought he was going to say they'd lifted the enchantment on the Astronomy Tower so that they could leave, like they did with the Apparition lessons in the Great Hall in the book.

The cave scene was reallly good. Gambon's acting when he was drinking the potion was good. He was actually saying, ""It's all my fault. It's all my fault."" I just wish they'd have had him say it a bit louder and clearer, it might have gone unnoticed by a lot of non-book readers. The Inferius grabbing Harry made me jump even though I saw it coming. It's the sound effect that does it. :D I wonder if the Inferius that grabbed Harry under water was Regulus. It would be a cool detail if in DH they revealed somehow that it was. It'd be ironic. Dumbledore with the fire was awesome, great display of power. 

Back on the astronomy tower, some people didn't like that Harry was only hiding below and not held by Dumbledore's spell, but I like it. I like the added poison to the knife for Harry that he was physically able to help Dumbledore, and could have from his hidden position underneath, but because of Snape telling him to be quiet he didn't. The conversation between Draco and Dumbledore was good, but as someone on the Lex has pointed out, the fact that Dumbledore let Draco disarm him means that Draco didn't really defeat Dumbledore, and therefore didn't really win the Elder Wand. *palm-forehead* Once again though Tom's acting was outstanding. His pain was obvious. And the look on his face after Snape killed Dumbledore, and as he was led through the castle, he just seemed like a kid who'd gotten way to deep into adult-dealings. I felt so sorry for him.

Belatrix seemed like a child at play when she was destroying the Great Hall and Hagrid's Hut, especially with the way she jumped up and down with glee at what she'd done to the hut. It was a good touch. But I was disappointed that it wasn't actually Snape who knocked Harry back like that, as the trailer suggested. That bit in the trainer seemed so cool on Snape's part. I also have to question whether movie-only audiences have been fooled at all into thinking Snape is actually on the dark side. The book audiences suspected his innocence but they weren't sure.

I was very concerned when I heard that the funeral scene wouldn't be in there, especially since I thought the scene in the book was so cinematic, but the pointing the wands at the sky bit was so sad that it totally made up for it! I had to hold back tears, and I liked Ginny comforting Harry. And I think I've heard that they're planning on putting the funeral into the beginning of DH, in which case I forgive them for cutting it from HBP.

Unfortunately, while I liked the vast majority of the middle of the film, the end annoyed me again almost as much as the beginning. Why? Because once again they neglected Ron. Why on earth was he just sitting there silently some feet behind his friends while they made a decision that would change all three lives forever? And once again they gave his lines to Hermione even though he was RIGHT THERE and could have said them. Granted this time it doesn't impact his personality, like it has in the past, but it does imply that Harry is closer to Hermione than to Ron, which just isn't true. I did however like Harry's line about never realising how beautiful the place was (although it seems hard to believe that anyone could fail to notice that, lol) and I really liked Fawkes flying across the sky.

So anyway, those were my impressions from watching the movie. What do you guys think?"

"event","I've just been playing the Half-Blood Prince video game. It's okay, there's really just three things that bother me a bit.

The first is the fact that the characters have gone back to only being able to run, not walk. In the Order of the Phoenix game they could walk or run. I didn't mind in the first three games but in this one it seems a bit annoying, not sure why.

The second is that although the environments are the same as in the OotP game the environment graphics aren't so good. They're not as bright and clear as they were. Perhaps it's because in the last game they wanted to show those environments off to full effect, and that could be why they allowed the characters to walk too, so that the player would have more time to take in the environments. It's a shame that's not the same this time, because I like casually making my way around the school.

The third thing is that there doesn't seem to be as much to do in the environments this time. It's really just collecting crests and mini crests and unlocking badges by completing tasks in the story. In the last one we had to tidy up Hogwarts, find out portrait passwords, play chess, gobstones and exploding snap, complete lesson challenges etc. But maybe they'll be more to do later.

Now that I've gotten the hang of it I do quite like potions. There's more to it than in previous games. I'm certainly enjoying this game more than the GoF one, which I don't think many people liked, which was why EA Games got the fans' feedback for the making of the OotP game."

"event","<lj-cut>Too long to do it all tonight. Overall I liked it. OotP is still my favourite though. :) Most of the bits that annoy me were towards the beginning, and I think I actually probably have fewer real complaints about this movie than any of the others, except maybe the first movie.

As I say, I'm not so keen on the beginning. It's just that the <i>way</i> in which it deviated from the book seemed weird and made it feel like it wasn't the same thing. Kind of like the dreams I've had sometimes where I see the upcoming movie and it's really weird and different from the book. Thinking back I quite like the concept of Dumbledore leading Harry away from the cameras but I can't remember Harry getting blood on his face in OotP. The destroying of the bridge was really random. It's like the Death Eaters went to Diagon Alley to get Ollivander, and then on their way back spontaneously decided, ""Oh look, a bridge. Let's destroy it."" The sequence might have worked better had the film makers applied the writers' ""rule of three"" - three attacks, Diagon Alley, the bridge, and something else. It would have seemed more like a glimpse into what the Death Eaters were up to now, and less like a one off incident. Do you know what I mean?

Flirting with the waitress was just really random. Can't really see why they put it in there. And I can't see Harry picking up a stranger in a dingy underground cafe for a fling somehow. Doesn't seem his style. Once they got to Slughorn's, and we moved from the totally original back to the realms of canon interpretation, it began to get progressively better. Clearing up the house was a great piece of computer wizardry, and very well done. And Dumbledore's remark at the end of it was funny (""That was fun."").

Actually, I have to pause here to say that Dumbledore was great throughout. In the past Gambon's Dumbledore has had out-of-character moments that have just been thoroughly irritating, like shaking Harry, but in this one he was perfectly in character the whole time I thought. He seemed more like book-Dumbledore. Ironic that they get him right just before he dies. Lol.

The Unbreakable Vow was good, though the scene was a bit too short and Narcissa wasn't very emotional given that her son was in danger. I would also have liked to see Belatrix looking more surprised that Snape agreed to the vow, like in the book. I liked the way that the actual vow was done though, and the way it left scars. The town they chose for Snape to live in was perfect, with all its winding back alleys.

Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes was a great set, wonderfully detailed, and the scene had great energy. Plus: ""How much is this?"" ""Five galleons?"" ""How much for me?"" ""Five galleons."" ""I'm your brother."" ""Ten galleons."" That got a laugh both times I saw the movie.

Following Draco and Narcissa was okay. Luna selling The Quibbler was funny, the wracksputs line was perfectly executed on Evanna's part. And the singing on boxing day line. Evanna was great throughout actually but then she always is. I especially loved her Gryffindor lion hat! Lol!

Tom Felton was outstanding in this movie. I like Draco's darker look, though I'm still not wild about pure blood fanatics wearing Muggle clothes. Stomping on Harry's face got gasps from the audience at my first viewing.

McGonagall had a little more to do in this one, which I'm always pleased about. Maggie Smith as McGonagall is one of the best casting decisions they've made. ""Take Mr Weasley with you, he looks far too happy over there."" *snort* Harry and Ron fighting over the Potions book was hilarious! And the look on Ron's face when he got the good book. :D I liked the potion making sequence, with Hermione getting increasingly despairing and Seamus getting blown up. Slughorn I thought was okay. Not quite as I'd imagined him, could have been fatter for example, but played very well by Jim Broadbent. Certainly he seemed in-character.

Dumbledore asking about whether Hermione was Harry's girlfriend seemed a bit like a slap in the face of the Harry/Hermione shippers at first, but thinking about it, it was obviously to clear the matter up for the movie-only fans. Though presumably that will happen in DH with the locket horcrux scene, so was it really necessary? I hope this isn't a sign that that bit won't be in DH. The penseive scene was done well. Hero Fiennes's expression when the wardrobe caught fire had a subtle but clear power-lustful look. The boy playing the older Tom Riddle later in Slughorn's memory really did look like an older version of Hero, so that was good casting. Shame we couldn't have had Christian Coulson back though.

Liked the scene in the Three Broomsticks. Hermione walking along tipsily was amusing and Katie being cursed was effective, but Snape in McGonagall's office was brilliant. ""You... just... know."" Lol.

Cormac McClaggan was well-cast, although I didn't imagine him to be so good-looking. He was <i>very</i> goodlooking. *grin* They didn't really capture Cormac's jerkishness or controlling nature though. He was more cocky and over-confident. I loved the contrast between his spectacular, dramatic saves and Ron's awkward, lucky saves. The match itself was faster than previous Quidditch matches, which was a good thing. Quidditch is supposed to be super-fast and thrilling. It was nice to see Quidditch back again. It's been absent for two movies.

And then we had the Ron/Lavender kiss which I'd seen many times in clips already. I liked that they kept in Hermione's birds, that was a nice touch. The bit where the birds chase Ron wasn't really played for laughs though, it was more sad. Her and Harry's friendship in that scene was sweet, I like the brother/sister nature of it, and her holding onto his arm. I just wish they'd given that kind of loving attention to Harry and Ron's friendship too. I mean, we had the talking in bed scene, which was nicely awkward, but we're not getting so much of a sense of closeness as with Harry and Hermione. Or at least I don't think so. There are some good buddy moments though.

The ""but I am the Chosen One"" bit still got a laugh at the Empire despite everyone having seen it loads of times already.

The Christmas party scene was one of my favourites. They cut out the vampire though, they did cast and film him. It must annoy actors when they're cast, filmed, paid, and then their scene gets cut. There's a still shot online of him with Luna and I can only imagine the conversation that would have taken place between them. *grin* But the bit with Cormac throwing up on Snape's shoes was so funny! And Snape in that scene was once again brilliant. ""Not so fast Potter."" And when he walked away without answering Harry's question was one of the few bits that got a little titter in my local cinema.

I'm not really fond of the attack on The Burrow. I know the film makers had a reason for it, but I just don't think it comes across. The Death Eaters didn't even try and kidnap Harry or anyone else, it just seemed like Belatrix and Greyback decided to do it for fun. Seems senseless to attempt, and pull off, an attack on the building where Harry Potter is, and not try to kidnap him. I hope The Burrow gets rebuilt for DH and that the damage isn't permanant. Poor Molly watching her home where she raised her children, with all its memories, going up in smoke! Incidentally, the finer details of that scene were not thought out. For example, if the house was destroyed along with everything in it then how come Harry still had his cloak, the Prince's book, and all his other stuff afterwards, and the others for that matter. That's the kind of detail J.K. would think of.

I'm going to leave it there for now. It's getting late and I have washing up to do. I'll finish this off tomorrow."

"event","My computer is fixed and I have it back. Whoot! I just need to reinstall all my programs and games now, and install my new HBP game. :D It's irritating not having the computer to hand, especially the internet. I use it so much.

The annoying thing is that while my brother saved all the files in my documents and settings folder, and the ones on my desktop, the saved games for the OotP game were in the C drive folder, so I've lost them. I was so close to 100% completion! Like 89%! I was mostly stuck on beating the Ravenclaw chess champion. I'd never played chess before. Oh well, I can replay it sometime. And I have the new game. :)

I have my notes about the HBP movie, which I made in the restaurant afterwards, and I have seen it twice so I think I have a good perspective now. I'll post my detailed review sometime soon once I've finished setting up my computer etc.

The difference though between the audiences the two times I've seen it! Seriously, the audience at the Empire was like the one at the Leicester Square cinema usually is - brilliant! Laughing at every little joke, reacting to everything, gasping... at one point someone went, ""Oh my God!"" They were all really well behaved too. The second time I saw it, three days later, was at my local multiplex. The audience only reacted to the VERY funny stuff, and there was literally a constant stream of people going up and down the steps to the door. Not even bothering to be quiet, just stomping along in groups. What's the point of paying weekend rates to see a movie when you're not even going to sit and watch it??? Honestly, cinemas should employ two rules: no one is let in after the start of the movie itself, and no one is let out until the end of the movie unless they're ill or really about to burst. Is that really so unreasonable? You wouldn't come and go like that at the theatre. If you can't manage to arrive on time it's your own problem. And if you're not responsible enough to go to the loo before you come in then that's your problem too.

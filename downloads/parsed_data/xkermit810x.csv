Well, today me, my mom, my dad, and kim went to Bangor.

I bought a wireless mouse for my laptop. I bought a carrying case too. :)

Then we went to JC Penny, they'er having a HUGE sale on clothes! I was like ""GIMME"" haha!!! I bought three pants fitch style. And a three shirts, fitch & american eagle style, and a jean coat. I paid about $48.00 for it all, and they said that I saved ""$210"" hah... So I guess that I lucked out. :D So I'm really happy! Now I can ditch my old geek clothes...  Yuck...

Yeah, me n' Kevin made up, so things are going WICKED good atm! :D

That's my blurb, I gotta go get packed for Jareds."

I'm bored, hungry, and thinking...

*sigh*

Yeah... I didn't know that LJ allowed you to use CSS until I saw Kevins LJ. So, I just re-did mine... And I didn't ""pose"" anyone. lol.

I noticed that Kevin took me off his friends list, his decision. God will change things with time. I still love you Kevin! Even if I made freaking dumb mistakes, it doesn't mean that I'm the same person that I was. And I'm not admitting to anything. < That goes for just about everone...

Anyways, It's s weird how God uses situations to change your attitude, it's like... I've never been so outcasted before, except for once. And usually I just go running my fat trap to poeple, (that fat trap got me into trouble in he first place), but it's like, it's dumb to string things out, the point is it happens, that peson feels what they feel, just drop it and things will get better and fast. dropping things for me hasn't exactly been easy either. But with God's help, it's pretty easy. And it's improved my life so much! It's weird, I'm like not talking to many people, and I'm so happy! It's like what Kevin said to me, ""Josh, you live like your dying, so your life is going to stink"", he's really right, as much as I don't want to admit it, he's 100% on target. And my usual thing was like ""you haven't lived my life"" or ""grow up"" it's like, Josh, take your own freaking advice! Grow up, let the past go! So yeah... Now things seem so awesome for me, even though I had like zero friends at that point, but then, on Sunday, I... Let loose? And it was so WEIRD. I had like 7 kids following me... I was like ""*sigh* it's good to be back"" but you know how much damage pride can cause? And living like your dying? It's amazing! And now I look back, and it's like ""WTF? OMG! I WAS SUCH A WEENIE"" so yeah, humble pie can leave a bitter taste in your tongue. So yeah.

But yeah, the past 4 months have been my hardest. He moved me out of my ""comfort zone"". It's like God just told me to ""drop"" my old grudges and crap. And you know, forgiving people who abused you as a kid, that isn't exactly EASY. lol. It's just tons of crap like that, and I like blamed God for it. Yes, gay, I know... But it may of hurt me in the friend area. But God gives me this peace saying ""just, let it go, and be your self, and I will do the rest"", I may sound crazy! But i don't feel it. It feels GOOD! I sound like a weirdo... HAH!

I have a feeling that NO one reads this... But it's good to get this crap out by blogging!

New saying: Don't let the past kill you, Let the past kill it's self.

God, I'm so happy! There's nothing better... :D

-

And so like yeah, my old dead crappy attitude and life is gone, and i'm on my, new, good, awesome, happy, loose, funny life now. It's so weird... But it feels SO GOOD.

Well yeah, I get to start my ""new"" life in N.H. at my best friends house! It's going to be AWESOME!!!!!!!!! Xbox live! Dsl internet! NEVER ENDING JUNK FOOD! TV! COUCHES! FOOTBALL! VIDEOS! SHOPPING! TALKING! And the best part! I get to see my OLD PASTOR AND HIS SONS!! i haven't seen Jeffrey and Christian in WAY TOOOOOOOOOOO LONG! I wonder if his sister still has a crush on me, ew... She's like 5 and obsessed with me being her b/f at a baseball game. I'm not going into anymore detail. But yeah, she's going to be pretty. HAH! I don't have any ideas... lol... Woah, Jordan H. is gonna freak! HAHA!!!!!!!!! I gotta bring a camerea for the look on her face when she hears who I am! She's gonna drop dead! HAHAH!!!!!! It's too bad, I don't like her anymore, hahah... ROFL!!! Scrap liking people, it's gay. Yes, I'm a homophob! AND PROUD OF IT! Hm, OMG! I almsot forgot about Brian! HAHAH!!!!!!!

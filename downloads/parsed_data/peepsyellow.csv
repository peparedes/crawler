"event","Well, here I am, still at Oxford.  It's Friday, so I have double classes, which is annoying.  Since it's the last day, though, we aren't actually going to work. :)  I packed a lot this morning, so that's good (I won't have a lot to do tonight after class).  I'm actually really excited to be going home.  I want to see my family and go on vacation and, believe it or not, go back to school as a Junior!!  I miss some of the people from school, especially two of my friends.  I haven't seen anyone from home in a month-I wonder if I've changed.  I kind of hope and think so-I think my personality has changed, but in a good way.  That would be cool.  Well, it's almost time for me to go to class.  I'll write again soon.

"event","Hey all!  Well, disco ice skating was classic fun, lol!  It was great, and there were guys there so that made it kind of interesting.  Although, I have absolutely no interest in the guys we were there with, so that puts a bit of a damper on my raging hormones, lol.  Also, I got blisters on my ankles from my skates!!!  Nooooo!  They are very painful, but I'll live.  Ugh, I totally have to pack tomorrow, which sucks!!! Oh well.  On a brighter note, I found this cd I've been looking for for a really long time, so that's pretty sweet.  Alright, I'll write again soon!

"event","Hey!  I am at Oxford University in England, which is pretty cool.  I'm having a great time and I've been here for a month.  Unfortunately, I'm going back home in a few days!!  :(  Although, I'm really excited about that because I'm going on vacation a week after I get back!  I'm going to California, which is really kewl.  We're going to stay at all these awesome hotels and resorts, and hopefully I'll get a tan.  Wow, I just realized that I sound really, really conceited!  I promise, I'm not actually like that.  I would like to think of myself as generally down to earth.  Now I'm just rambling, and my friends are here in my dorm room, and they all want to watch ""Pride and Prejudice"" on my computer's DVD player.  I'll write again soon!

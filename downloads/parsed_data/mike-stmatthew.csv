""Not the real news, you know. They don't print the real news. That's nothing but censored press clippings from the state-run Department of Propaganda.""

""All our news is controlled. You know who runs the Federal Reserve Board. Nobody does. Aliens from Planet X. That Alan Greenspan even looks like a Klingon. A lot of people don't believe in aliens, but I know they exist. I saw one. At the 7-11. It was getting a large Slurpee with sprinkles. It's all part of the conspiracy. Newspapers, aliens, the Kennedy assassinations. You know who really assassinated the Kennedys - Hitler. And Hitler really wasn't a Nazi. That was part of a cover-up by his real group, the Shriners. Those little cars they drive in, powered by cold fusion, they don't want anybody to know. It's a conspiracy.""

""We should all search our papers for hidden messages, right?""

""They put hidden messages in the paper. That's how I found Diana wasn't really a princess. She was a Freemason, working for the Jesuits.  Ever wonder what those Masons keep in their jars?  Opium. That's how they control the world. The opium conspiracy. They put it in Slurpees to make them taste so good.""

""Just thought you'd like to know. Chernobyl! You know what really happened? Aliens spilled a Slurpee on the control panel.""

""Don't blame me after the New World Order takes over. They're going to force everyone to take opium and drink Slurpees. Want to know something really weird? Bin Laden and George Bush are brothers. ""

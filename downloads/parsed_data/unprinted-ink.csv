I done it again! Stupid me! I thought that maybe i could handle <i>not</i> making myself sick.Silly Me.Fucking ate like LOADS today.Well,tonight.Didn't go to bed last night,so slept all day today.Got woke up at 5pm to get my dinner.<b>Big</b> plate of chips and half a pizza.You know,one of those giant pizza's? Well,i felt abit sick,but thought i could keep it down.Then Mum and Dad went out,and i picked a <i>whole</i> tub of fucking Tomatoes,and Half a jar of ready salted peanuts! Oh,not forgetting the 2 Cans of Pepsi. I felt way bad.All those fatty things in my system,just waiting to pounce on my thighs,hips and ass.Not to mention the tummy.So off i went upstairs inot the bathroom,got my toothbrush,locked myself in the toilet,and planted my butt on the floor,next to the loo. Most peopole would think i was attention seeking.But if they could understand the way i feel when eating.It's like,iv'e done something really bad,and that if i dont make myself sick i should be punished. Anyways,I feeel much better now.I don't feel bloated,and i feel happy that i wont put on anymore weight! It's all good! I think thats gonna be my news years resolution! Lose weight!

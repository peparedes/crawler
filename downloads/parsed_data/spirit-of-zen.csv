"event","So at Thanksgiving, we are all hanging out at Terra's brother's house.  Doug is playing on the floor with Chase and Terra's mom is there along with Doug's mother in law and father in law and Chase is just as cute as can be...

and in that E True Hollywood Story sort of way...

thats when things went horribly wrong.

Chase gets a drink of tea and then manages to drop the cup, spilling ice on the floor and says 

SON OF A BITCH! 

For the most part, everyone laughed, except Terra's mom, who was horrified.

I want to say that its Terra's fault, but i think i found the root of the problem.

"event","SO yesterday was the sono that was suppose to tell us if we were going to be having a boy or a girl, but ""it"" would not cooperate and we couldn't get a good angle by which to tell the gender, so we still don't know.  :(   Good news, the baby is doing fine from what they can see, but at 18 weeks its hard to see all they need to see, so we get to go back again in a couple of weeks and maybe that time we will know for sure what we are having.

in not quite so related news.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TERRI!   

in somewhat related news.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOSCLYN RUSH!  born yesterday  9 lbs  10ounces. 


And from the HOLY COW department,  I got a call today. It was from an agency that essentially headhunts for other corporations to fill jobs that need filled. 

I put my resume on Monster.com a long time ago, and i have recieved about 100000000000 emails with crap jobs on them, but not today. No today i got a phone call and it was a lady who is interested in me for a job that would make me the guy who travels to laboratories and trains them on how to use their instruments.  

 So i guess i can live whereever i want, because i would be a field agent, thus i could run my office from home, but i would be mostly out on site training in places as far west as Denver and as far east as Indianapolis.  This job would put me at 60K plus a year starting salary and i am sure there are incentives. 

So i am sending in my resume and hoping for the best.

over and out."

"event","I know that I will sound crazy, but there are times that i swear i get glimpses of the future, accompanied by strong gut feelings that become impossible for my mind to deny. 

These happen frequently and most of them have come true. Unfortunately, they are never any critical point in time, so the images i see make little sense to me, almost like i am seeing some place i have never been or nearly faceless people and voices i dont recognize at first.  Then later on in my life, it happens, and when it does, it rings back to my mind as clear as the day i first experienced it. 

One of the more eerie ones, was when i went to tech school in Vincennes.  Two years prior, in a fit of daydreaming, i had a 3 second vision of a glass window with a green lighted sign above it with the word ""Pizza"" written on it, and i could see the countertop around it and the single slice of pizza rotating behind the glass and muffled voices all around me.  

sort of a strange vision to have right? 

Well two years later, i am interviewing for tech schools and am in Vincennes, IN.  It happens to be my birthday and there was two feet of snow that dumped that day in a horrible blizzard. I ventured out for the one hour trip, which ended up taking three hours, but i made it down to my interview... a bit late, but i made it and Phil, the director was quite impressed by my arrival.  He asked if i had eaten, and i said no, and so he took me to the cafeteria.  We were in line, discussing my current finals and classes when he turns and says ""The pizza here is pretty good, you should take the last piece before its gone."" 

So i turn and i freeze.  The muffled voices of the other people in the cafeteria became familar, not like recognizing the lyrics to a song, but recognizing the tune of a song being hummed by someone walking down the road.  There it was, right there before me, the exact scene that i had seen while daydreaming.  A real case of Deja Vu, only years later. I had never been there before, so it was not like a memory. Then Phil went to say something to me, and i already knew what he was going to say. 

this happens frequently, and when it does, it sort of scares the hell out of me.  Thus far, they have served only as ""check points"" for me, sort of signs to my mind that I am where I am suppose to be, but saying that would suggest that i have some sort of destiny to me or some special purpose that i am waiting to happen, sitting around picking up some varied skills for some higher purpose. 

So i put all this here and i ask simply?

What does it all mean? 

And what happens when one comes along... and i don't like what i see in it?"

Hey you caught me in a coma
And i don't think i wanna
Ever come back to this...world again
Kinda like it in a coma
'cause no one's ever gonna
Oh, make me come back to this...world again
Now i feel as if i'm floating away
I can't feel all the pressure
And i like it this way
But my body's callin'
My body's callin'
Won't ya come back to this...world again
Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end
I've got the bones on the mast
Well i've gone sailin', i've gone sailin'
I could leave so easily
While friends are calling back to me
I said they're
They're leaving it all up to me
When all i needed was clarity
And someone to tell me
What the fuck is going on
Goddamn it!


Slippin' farther an farther away
It's a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit


Help me
Help me
Help me
Help me
Bastard


Please understand me
I'm climbin' through the wreckage
Of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation just can't
Stifle all my screams
And i'm waitin' at the crossroads
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Where are you


No one's gonna bother me anymore
No one's gonna mess with my head no more
I can't understand what all the fightin's for
But it's so nice here down off the shore
I wish you could see this
'cause there's nothing to see
It's peaceful here and it's fine with me
Not like the world where i used to live
I never really wanted to live


Zap him again
Zap the son of a bitch again


Ya live your life like it's a coma
So won't you tell me why we'd wanna
With all the reasons you give it's
It's kinda hard to believe
But who am i to tell you that i've seen
Any reason why you should stay
Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway


You got a one way ticket
On your last chance ride
Gotta one way ticket
To your suicide
Gotta one way ticket
An there's no way out alive
An all this crass communication
That has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation
When you feel so weak and old
But is home is where the heart is
Then there's stories to be told
No you don't need a doctor
No one else can heal your soul


Got your mind in submission
Got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger
They just stepped aside
They be down by the water
While you watch 'em waving goodbye
They be callin' in the morning
They be hangin' on the phone
They be waiting for an answer
When you know nobody's home
And when the bell's stopped ringing
It was nobody's fault but your own
There were always ample warnings
There were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it comin'
But we gave you too much time
And when you said that no one's listening
Why'd your best friend drop a dime
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting
For a way to spend our time
An ""it's so easy"" to be social
""it's so easy"" to be cool
Yeah it's easy to be hungry
When you ain't got shit to lose
And i wish that i could help you
With what you hope to find
But i'm still out here waiting
Watching reruns of my life
When you reach the point of breaking
Know it's gonna take some time
To heal the broken memories
That another man would need
Just to survive"

"event","It has been a long long weekend.  Went to LARP on Friday, had a good time.  Things at game are still a hair on the screwy side, but I will say, its interesting.  Saturday morning, went with the wife and kid to the park for Chase to play.  It is simply amazing watching him grow up. He learns so many things without really being taught, and most the time, you are never sure exactly when or how he figured things out.  For instance, while at the park, he decided to use the wood trim that holds all the wood chips in the playland as a balance beam.  In past attempts, he would fall off, cry and that would be the end of it.  But this time, he figured out how to balance himself and correct his imbalances by holding out his arms and leaning.  Surely it must be instinctual for him to want to learn such a trick. Either way, it never ceases to amaze me just how quickly he is becoming his own little person. 

Anyways, Saturday then switched gears as the guys gathered for Cadwallon, a French RPG that has possibly the best system EVER.  Now when i said BEST, you will notice i did not say EASIEST nor did I say SIMPLE.  If the book was written in an order that made any sort of sense, it might help improve character creation a bit, but for our first time, getting chars rolled up in just shy of 4 hours seemed pretty good, then it was time to test the system.  A few hours of testing combat abilities, social abilities, and influence/contact ratings, i think we all got the system down and i think this game is going to rock!!!!  Guess we will see from here.

SO this morning rolls around and I get a call from my cousin, the BJB, who informs me that the moving crew he hired never showed up and he needs moved out of his apartment and into his new town house.  So today has been mostly alot of heavy lifting, and minor sacrifices of the body.  At one point, when attempting to get the entertainment center down the very cramped stair case, i found some small reserve of strength i honestly didnt know i had, and BJB said he was pretty sure i turned green and my pants, purple. 

the entertainment center made it onto the truck.

"event","Alot of people who meet me have problems imagining that I was ever a member of a Greek Organization, let alone one of its more popular members or even its highest ranking officer.  Its all true.  This segment will reveal to you how i went from a backwards high school boy, to the leader of a Fraternal Organization.  It will not reveal any of the secrets of Phi Gamma Delta, nor will I go too far into the party aspects of my college life. That gets a segment all to itself. This segment in this running series will simply discuss the different roles i played in the Fraternity and how I got to where I am now. 

<lj-cut text='The Life and Times of Me - The FIJI'>

 When i went to college, i had no intentions on joining a fraternity.  I was probably the furthest thing from ""frat"" material imaginable.  Truth is, I was exactly what most fraternities were looking for, but much like the rest of the world, i was sold that Fraternities were the very organizations portrayed in movies like ""Animal House"" or in that new TV series ""GREEKS"".  Truth of the matter is, Greek Fraternities are societies based upon century old principles, who practice age old rituals and cover it all up with a few wild parties and some lavish stories. 

 If i had to blame anyone for me becoming a FIJI, it was probably Robbie Smith.  Robbie Smith was not a FIJI at all. In fact, he still is not a FIJI and never will be.  He was, however, my roommate in the dorms.  I had been introduced to members of several fraterntities and recieved bids from several of them as well.  Robbie on the other hand, accompanied me to the FIJI event I went to, and signed the bid the next day.  I was still undecided but Robbie persuaded me to Rush FIJI with him and so it was.  We were then to be roommates and pledge brothers as part of the Beta Lambda Pledge Class of the Iota Sigma Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta along with 14 other guys, making 16 total.  

 Pledging itself, was not anything like I had figured. I was told to arrive at the house in shirt and tie at 5pm that Friday and that all of us Pledges to be were to arrive together as a group.  We all met up on campus and carpooled over. When we arrived, we were all ushered out to a Graduate Brothers place for a dinner.  The dinner was completely silent.  We ate speghetti and garlic bread.  Before this dinner, we pledges had only seen the guys as socialites, playing basketball and attending parties.  This was the first time we had seen them all so serious about something.  None of us seemed to know what we were in for. 

 After dinner, we were all ushered back and taken to the top floor of the house while the brothers prepared the basement.  While up there, we had the one task of arranging ourselves in order of age from oldest to youngest. Then we were led downstairs and seated into a dark room.  One by one, in order, we were taken into the chapter room and pledged, then brought in as a group for the ceremony to be completed. Afterwards, we went out and had one hell of a party. 

 For the next semester, we remained pledges, taking 10 weeks of classes called ""Pledge Education"" in which we met as a pledge class and studied the history of fraternities, the founding of our Fraternity, all the important positions of the Fraternity, and all that relevant stuff. We had test every week on the material and a final at the end of the 10 weeks. Aside from those tests, we had to keep a 2.5 GPA and complete an interview with each of the intitated brothers.  For some like myself that was easy, but for those like Robbie, who were terrible at time management, well, that 2.5 was a steep goal. He got a 1.0 and was not initiated in February like I was. It was sad, and looking back now, i should have done more as his pledge brother to help him get intitated.  I was too inexperienced at the time and too sold on the concept that every man paves his own destiny.  I know now, that it just isn't so. Robbie will always be one the few things i really regret in my Fraternity experience. 

 The next major step for me was initiation. I cannot tell you much about initiation except that it completely blew my mind. All the things you think of when you hear the word ""fraternity"" are inherently false. My Fraternity was founded by 6 men, who we call the Immortal Six in the year 1848.  You think of what a college man was in 1848, and what a social circle was back then, and you might have a better idea of what a Fraternity is at its core. I won't go any further, but it has remained as one of the most influential days of my life. 

 Now that i was initiated, i was given responsibility.  I was appointed as Scholarship Chairman. My job was to organize some academic competition to support good grades from the Brothers, so i set up teams and aquired Pacers tickets for the winners.  That was about all i did, but somehow, it granted me a State Award at State Day for Scholarship Programming.  Don't ask me, I didn't think i did all that much.  It was, however, the only award my chapter would win during the 4 years i was at Iota Sigma. Guess that speaks for something. 

 Having achieved glory at the level of committee chairman, i was then catapulted to potential officer material in only my second semester on campus.  Elections were held at the end of the school year and new officers took over at the beginning of the new school year and so my first Cabinet Position i ran for was Historian.  Historian was the one who was responsible for the ritual, its materials, and teaching it to new initiates. It seemed like something i could do. Only one person ran against me, my Fraternity Big Brother, Mike Arnold.  He won with a vote count of 34-0.  Yes, even I voted for him.  No big deal, i was going to enjoy my time and try to improve my already award winning scholastics program. 

 Turns out i wouldnt get much of a chance before i catapulted my Big Brother in the ranks.  When the Fall Semester opened up, the Treasurer, Jeff Horner, went into one of his fits of immaturity and decided to abandon his position as Treasurer, the 2nd in command, and through some stroke of ill fate or their ability to see something in me that I didnt know i had, the chapter voted me in as Treasurer.  Now i never had my own checkbook before, or a saving account.  I also never had any real bills of my own short of my fraternity bill.  Safe to say i had no applicable skill to be Treasurer, but Jeff showed me the ropes and I eventually took over.  When I took over, the books were a mess and collections were done by the Treasurer alone.  When i stepped down out of office, the books were digital, the debt halved from 5K in debt and unpaid bills down to 2K in bills and unpaid debt.  I guess my efforts turned a few heads.  The end of my sophmore year, I was hailed ""The Savior of Iota Sigma"" by one senior member and voted in as President of the Chapter. 

 So starting my Junior Year, I was President.  I had a good cabinet and a plan to remove the debt that was strangling the chapter to death.  We organized an ingenius fundraising plan where we would work at Six Flags over the summer as a group and throw some nice bonfire parties at night at a Brothers place down near Louisville, KY.  The events went over well and our debt was erased and we had money left over to purchase intramural T shirts for the Brothers for the upcoming year. Things were going well.  We had ambitious plans to hold a community service event, a ""Hot Tub-A-thon"" which eventually did happen at a radio station and I got some airtime on the radio. I also spent about 12 hours in the hot tub with selected sorority members who pledged time to the cause. My presidency was shaping up to live up to the hype, i was set to be the ""Savior of Iota Sigma"" that they had hailed me as. 

 Then my parents got divorced.  Best thing that ever happened to either of them.  What does that have to do with any of this?  Well, it screwed up my financial aid and i had to redo it and thus my money didnt come in til second semester and i racked up a huge bill with the Fraternity. I was also making two trips a week up to Champaign to see Terra and the guys started to see me as a bit of an absent leader.  Next thing I knew, i was the chapter scapegoat and being hung out to dry.  I guess like any notable savior, you gotta be martyed and in the last meeting of the first semester, I was impeeched from office and replaced by Josh Goldman, my best friend and roommate in the house.  It was hard not being President, but i found that no longer having responsibility, i could dedicate my time to securing my senior year internship and also taking more time to dedicate to Terra, who i was now engaged to. 

 When i left the house my Junior Year, the Chapter was slipping back into trouble.  Goldman did a bang up job in my stead but more issues started draggin the chapter back into debt and while i was away in Vincennes doing my clinical internship, the chapter returned to a state fo severe debt and a low GPA to boot. I had little to no contact with the chapter during this year.  I think it was the time i needed away so i could return to do what had to be done. 

a year later, i returned to Pig Dinner in the Spring and attended a Housing Corp meeting.  At that meeting, a Board of Chapter Advisors was chosen. I was appointed Recruitment Chairman. I did my best to teach the guys how to recruit quality men, but they seemed more interested in recruiting guys who were good at riding Trike for the trike race and who liked to party and carry a 2.2 or so GPA.  Well, you can only do what you can do. 

I held the position of Recruitment Chairman for the next 5 years and watched on painfully as the chapter debt ran up to 10K. Later on, i would find myself voted onto the Housing Corporation and later become its Secretary. With two graduate positions under my belt, you would think i would have had the power to make change, but the BCA and HC were both a joke and the chapter slowly fell to a point where after one visit i made, I put out a call to arms to the Graduates. We organized and gave it one last shot, but we failed and now the Iota Sigma chapter has sold its house and all but turned over its charter.  In the end, we did it justice. We ended Iota Sigma with respect instead of having IHQ come in and take it from us, we surrendered it willingly and for all the right reasons.  Now our debt is paid off and we no longer have hooligan Brothers giving our beloved Fraternity a bad name.  I guess in the end, I did live up to that ""Savior of Iota Sigma"" after all.  Just not in the way I had always intended. 

IN the meantime, I had hopped on board up here with the Recolonization of Chi Iota chapter. I started out as the Pledge Educator with 16 guys and from that, I have helped guide these gentlemen to bring in 40+ men of high quality and watched proudly as they recieved their charter this past year. They then appointed me their Purple Legionnaire officially which I still serve as today. 

 In alot of ways, the success up here has been my retribution for the mistakes i made.  They have renewed my faith in Phi Gamma Delta and in my own abilities to advise and lead as a Graduate.  They are exceptional men, every last one of them, and they suprise me at every turn. Word around IHQ is that I might even be up for awards for my work.  I don't know about any of that, but i do know that already, the Chi Iota Chapter has named one of their annual awards after me and just knowing that all 40 of those men, who will go on to do great things in their own right, all look to me for wisdom and guidance and just knowing that long after i have seen my final days, that my picture will hang in the halls of the Chi Iota House and an award will carry my name for decades to come is enough reward.  After all, here at Phi Gamma Delta, we do not do things for ""the applause of men.""  We do the things we do, because its what is right.

So that pretty much sums it up. Thats how i became the FIJI i am today.  There is another side to this whole story, the less organizational side and the more personal side, the social side.  But it will be a differnt thread for a different date.

Most of you who read these forums have only ever known me during my married life with Terra.  We were married nearly 5 years ago and just after we moved up here and i started working at the Clinic.  While it would be a absolutely wonderful story to say that we were high school sweethearts, you will find the truth to be quite the opposite. But my luck with the girls(or lack there of) can be traced back to the first grade.

 I remember very little about the first grade except for a couple of things. My best friend at the time, Doug Pine was in a car accident and moved away afterwards, and I had one of those cute little childhood crushes on a girl named Miranda.  Of course, I was about as shy and akward as they came back then, and frankly, I didn't have any real idea what to say to her, and absolutely no clue what she thought of me.  So safe to say, it never developed anything beyond making sure she got the best valentine out of the assorted box my Mom bought for me to take to school, and a standing invite to my birthday party that year, which she didnt attend, but she did later bring me a gift.  I remember it was a motorcycle, and I didn't really have any fascination with motorcycles, but since it was from her, I remember playing around with it.  Guess I was a bit of sucker like that. Well due to the wonderful school system in Paris, I was at Redmon School from 1st to 5th Grade. Redmon is now closed down, and sadly in 100 years of being open, its claim to fame is that it is the grade school that Alfalpha went to school at. So for this 5 year stretch, nothing really changed. 

 6th Grade, however, was a different story. You see, Redmon was one of 4 elementary schools in Paris for District 95. Mayo Middle School, however, was the dumping ground for all 4 of the schools. This meant that for the first time, i wouldn't be in one class room all day, but have lockers, and schedules, and take classes like home economics and health. The 6th grade also was a time when one other thing changed. My childhood crush on Miranda went away.  She went to Mayo just as I did, and we were even friends still, but the feelings just went away. They did have some help in the form of a girl named Kelli.  If there was one thing that didn't change when i went to middle school, it was that i was still just as shy and backwards as i was before.  I would spend the better part of my 6th - 8th grade years with a crush on Kelli that she would never know anything about. Two of her friends, however, did have a bit of a crush on me. In hindsight, i should have probably dated them, just went out, had fun, and probably in the end found the confidence I needed to approach Kelli, but somehow down inside of me, i would have felt wrong using them as some stepping stone, so I simply told them how i felt, and just kept them as friends.  Now during this time, I met another girl named Carrie. Carrie had the last other name that started with an O, which meant that in every subject we had together and even our lockers were going to be forever next to one another.  My mom and her mom did their best to hook the two of us up. Carrie was thin, blonde, and actually quite attractive.  I would have been a fool to pass her up, and well, I was that fool. We were extremely close friends, i helped her pass all her classes, and the closet to a couple we ever were, was that she wore my basketball jersey on the day of all the home games and my number ""40"" was painted on her cheek at each game.  I think once we went to a Winter Dance together, but it never turned into anything.  Don't ask me why. If i had to guess, id say it was to rebel against our mothers who tried to set us up. Either way, it secured Kelli as my middle school crush and as the 8th grade came and went, it was time for High School. 

 Now just as Mayo was a dumping ground for 4 elementary schools.  Paris High School was the dumping ground for not only District 95, but also District 4 (Crestwood) and the Catholic School (St. Mary's) and so for the first time, the whole world of Paris at my disposal. My crush on Kelli still was there, but i found that somehow, over that summer, some things changed.  Not my feelings, but the girls.  Some of them, through some sort of minor miracle, got damn hot. Don't ask me how.  It just happened.  Regardless, i found myself looking around a bit more for other viable options.  My locker was still next to Carrie, I still had classes with Kelli, but i found that a few other girls i hadn't met were interested in me. For starters, there was Robin.  Robin was a thin blonde with wavy hair and pretty blue eyes. She was in my study hall and her friend Morgan (girl btw) was her official spokesperson. She would courier the messages from Robin to me and after a day or two of a few flirting comments and a look or two, and Robin and I were set to go to Winter Carnival together.  It was my first dance since I took Carrie to the Middle School winter dance a few years back, and this time, I got the girl on my own. I can remember being quite excited that a girl was interested in me for once. 

 Well the dance came around and I got the flowers and the clothes and all that jazz and my mom took me to meet her (didnt have my own liscense yet) to pick her up and drop us off at the gym. I was nervous but less akward that ussual.  The dance went well. Robin was sorta quiet and we danced alot but for some reason, i was too shy to kiss her. I did secure from her that she would like to go out with me sometime again, and my whole world went in circles.  I remember dropping her off and then going home and lying on the couch in the living room and just feeling happy for the first time in a long time.  Of course, as my luck would have it, she had a change of heart 4 days later, saying that I had ""changed"".  *shrugs*  It sorta made study hall a bit wierd for a while, but later on, we ended up just friends.

 When i got dumped, it was a bit of a setback. I had a math class with Miranda, Carrie, and Kelli (who were now close friends... i know, the odds right?) and we all occupied the back corner of the room and chatted it up alot.  It explains why still today I do not understand algebra as well as I should. The exposure did rekindle my feelings for Kelli, however, and so the chase was on once again. I remember that for a while, I carried a note in my pocket to school everyday, detailing how i had felt for so long, but just like any other attempt i ever made to call her or talk to her beyond just idle chat, sort of dwindled away to me just being sheepish and helping her understand palabras.  

So my junior year, some things shifted again. I had grown a few more inches, slimmed down considerably and toned up a bit.  From what i was later told, I had become ""hot"", but you could have fooled me, and even if they had told me then, i would have never believed it.  I did have lot more confidence though and it showed mostly in PE, where my athleticism shined. I had played years of basketball with organized teams and amongst the junkies and less fortunates, i dominated the courts and well, when you make being good at basketball look that easy and when you can throw a dodgeball with poinpoint accuracy from clear across the gym, i guess it attracts some attention from the girls in the class and before i knew it, i had two girls in my PE class who had crushes on me.  One of them was very open about it, but she was a bit of a whore and i had no interest, and the other was this cute freshman girl named Danielle.  One day before PE, she asked me out and in that second of stunned ""WTF"" I said... sure. For nearly a month we were an item. I had a nearly full time job, so dating was a little tough but we talked on the phone alot and met up for lunch everyday.  One day at lunch, we shared our first kiss, which i am sure was not her first, but it was mine. I am sure that back then i was a terrible kisser, but she never let on.  We went to (yes that right) a Winter Carnival Dance (yes i somehow become more attractive in the late fall and early winter) upon which we had a great time.  Two days later, her best friend tells me that Danielle was cheating on me with some guy from a nearby town.  The next day, we were done.  That would have been the end of the story, except that I still see Danielle on a semi regular basis because she happens to be Terra's cousin... small world right? 

  So having been dumped once by Robin, and cheated on by Danielle, i reset my sights on someone else. That someone for once was not Kelli, but a girl named Brandy.  Brandy was a bit of a different girl than the rest mentioned.  She wasn't cute like the others were, not in that slim and blonde sort of way.  No, Brandy was just downright gorgeous. She was one of those girls who was hot, but you didnt notice it so much because she was so damn funny and her personality sort of won you over before you noticed how good looking she was.  Brandy was not real athletic however, so at PE, she often was one of the ""walkers"" who didnt do the sports but walked all hour.  Well,  later on, i found myself walking with her the whole hour and just laughing and thinking to myself.  ""Wow, if only she wasn't out of my league.""  I remember one day we were walking out at the park for PE and the rest of the class was playing baseball.  Brandy asked me if i was any good at batting and i told her to watch.  I briefly went over to the game and inserted myself into the on deck circle for the batting team, upon which i was handed a bat and took a small moment of enjoyment as the whole field shifted backwards about 30 feet.  The diamond had no real fence, so homeruns meant hitting one clear out into the road or into the small fenced in area around the water tower.  The pitch came from the PE teacher and I let it rip and the ball soared across the street. I took a very ""Babe Ruth"" leizurely stroll around the bases and then promptly returned to Brandy along the walking path.  She was quite impressed, and I was feeling pretty good.  The next day in PE, we were in the gym due to rain, and playing basketball.  Basketball was really the only sport in which i loved to play enough that i left Brandy to walk on her own and watch on while i played. After my homerun fiasco, the PE class caught on that i sorta had a crush on Brandy, so when they heard me tell her that i would make a turn around three point shot for her in the scrimmage game, they all turned up the defense a notch.  Despite their double and even triple teams, i still still leaps better than most of them as the time on the clock ran down, i got the ball near the corner with my back to the basket and my feet behind the line and i turned and let the ball release and as i faded back towards the locker rooms the ball went in and buzzer went off. As the rest of the guys who played walked past me and into the locker rooms, i turned up to the catwalk and saw Brandy wave down to me and smiling really big. It was the first time in a while, i felt like i might have a chance with her. 

two days later, she asked me to prom.  

Prom came and i got the tux and the flowers.  We were double dating with a second couple and we went to the Olive Garden for dinner and then to prom. When we got to prom, we were there about 5 minutes before Brandy was ready to leave.  As it turns out, she had a BOYFRIEND, and that boyfriend was throwing a party.  She told me i was invited, but i said forget it. We got our pictures taken and i went out to find a few of my friends who decided not to go to prom.  It was the first and only time I ever smoked pot.  

 After that fiasco, Brandy felt pretty horrible, and i pretty much let her.  Alot of people abandoned Brandy for the way she treated me and she lost some friends over it.  A few years later, after High School,  Brandy fell off the top floor of a military building to her death. Some say she jumped, others say she fell from being intoxicated.  Who knows the truth.  All i know, is that I wasn't able to attend the funeral. I found out later, that half the pictures around her casket, were ones of me and her at that prom.  I still have the glass mug and a picture of her and i together at that prom. for a long time, i even kept the small flower-thing i wore on my tux that night in the mug.  Sort of my small shrine to her. I felt really bad that i never accepted her appologies. Sometimes i wonder if i had just let her walk alone, if she would have kept all those friends she had and if her death was a suicide, if she would still be around today. 

Well, back to High School, my junior year ended and my senior year began.  My feelings were again for Kelli, who was this time in my English class with Carrie and Miranda (again) and this time, Kelli sat right in front of me.  So again, i wrote her a letter and kept it in my pocket to give to her. I never did give it to her.  At one point in time, Miranda told me that Kelli in fact did have the hots for me, but those rumors were soon dispelled when Kelli started dating this guy named Blaze (yes, Terra's ex boyfriend.. i know, small world again).  So my interest were pretty much shot. 

About this time, my friend Joe, who had similar bad luck with the ladies, came to me yapping about this girl he worked with at KMart named Terra Mace.  Joe was all shy and just as akward as I was and so he wanted me to double date with him and Terra, and date Terra's friend Kari.  Well to be quite honest, i was open for new suggestions and so i said ""sure"" and they set me up on a quasi blind date.  I say quasi only because i had met Kari before, but just in passing, so i knew who she was but i didnt know her.  Well the four of us hit it off pretty well. Went putt putt golfing in Terre Haute (in which Terra flashed Joe to make him miss a putt and now swears up and down it was all a show for me)  We would play euchre on weekends til the wee hours of the morning at Terra's house out in Vermillion. Eventually, things with Joe and Terra never really worked out and while I liked Kari, and i really tried to make things work, it just never really took off either at the time, and things sorta died out just as quickly as they had started.  

It did bridge the gap til the end of my senior year.  The graduating ceremony was always the last big time in High School upon which you had to find that person of the opposite sex to walk in with and be announced with for the ceremony and in high school fashion, it was always a big deal.  I wasn't sure who i was going to ask, frankly, i didnt care. Now in what i can only call irony, the decision was made for me.  One day in English class, i was minding my own business, when Kelli turned to me and asked me if i would walk in with her.  I agreed of course and a few days later i walked into a packed gym, with her on my arm and i can remember thinking about the years i had spent wanting to ask her out.  When i walked up and recieved my diploma, i told reminded myself that it was not over, i still college ahead of me.  I was heading to Indiana State and Kelli was heading off to Southern Illinois and so i knew it was at an end and it was time for me to move on. If Kelli taught me one thing, it was to have no fear.  To this day, it is highly unlikely that she knows the full extent of the feelings i had for her. 

 College finally rolled around and I moved into the dorms at ISU. I remember from day one deciding that my 18 years of Paris life no longer meant anything.  Noone cared that i came from a poor family, or that i wasn't on the football team or basketball team.  It didn't matter anymore who my parents were or if they were on a school board or city council. All that mattered was that i was a sexy bitch and it was time for all the girls at Indiana State to find out. So once i got all packed in, i set forth with the socializing.  I ventured out and about my first week on campus and met probably 20 - 30 girls, landing lunch and dinner dates with about 15 in the first two weeks. None of them went much further than that, but i made alot of friends out of the deal.  Next thing i knew, i was pledging a fraternity, was hanging out at wild fraternity parties and i had whole new avenues to explore. 

 Well by semster break, my hyper social attitude towards women settled and i was given a chance to go to a hayride dance with this girl named Keri (yes i know, the third different spelling for the same name).  She was older than me, and nice, but a real slosh and a bit of a bitch, so after the dance, we sorta parted ways and i was rather ok with that.  Second semester, something else happened.  My buddy, Joe got ahold of me and him and Terra and Kari wanted to come visit me in the dorms.  I was agreed and my roommate Robbie was always up for company and drinking and so my dorm ended up full of people and booze.  I don't recall how the whole night went, but at some point, Robbie was looking at porn on my computer, a few people were passed out on my floor, and Terra was up in my bed.  Now her and my friend Joe had been broken up for nearly a year and they were not dating at the time, and i wasn't dating Kari or Keri, and so i climbed on up into MY bed.  I sure as hell was not sleeping on the floor. Now in all fairness, I did invite Kari to come join Terra and I up on my top bunk, upon which she declined and continued looking at porn with Robbie. 

 Now from here, the night gets sketchy.  I remember clearly laying next to Terra, and i do recall talking to her about Kari, and why i wouldn't give Kari another shot and that i should ask her out.  Thats what i remember.  Now somewhere in there, I was later told i tried to kiss Terra and that i put my arm around her.... *shrugs*   I was really drunk, so i wouldn't put it past me twice. Terra was cute and in my bed with me.  Well as the story would have it, my friend Joe didnt take to well to that and got quite mad at me. Kari got mad as well and before i knew it, i was out of bed and in the hall, talking to Kari and after a bit, Kari and I were going out again and Joe had sore knuckles from punching the concrete walls.  A part of me would love to get a time machine, if for no other reason than to go back and see how that all exactly went down.  It still baffles me today. 

 Now this is not to say that I didn't like Kari.  She was cute and smart and we had alot in common (both being interested in the medical field and all) and we did go out on a date or two, but just like the first time around, things just never really developed from there and before i knew it, Terra and Kari were all no longer speaking to me. I had become ""the asshole"".  

 So as i had done many times before, i moved on. The next girl i would meet was a Canadian girl. I met her first over an online game, then talked to her on the phone.  Joe still talked to me and visited a few times and he spoke to her as well.  Robbie wanted to road trip to Canada so the three of us made plans to go up and meet this girl from the internet.  Well when the time came, they both wussed out and i ended up going alone.  It turns out, the girl was Asian Canadian, cute, but extremely small and very thin. I only ended up staying two nights and i didnt have alot of money so a couple of dinners and a night in a hotel was about all that ended up happening.  It was the first time for both of us and niether of us knew what we were doing, so all sorts of things just didnt quite go right.  Safe to say, when i left Canada, we agreed to keep in contact, but never did. And that was the end of that. 

 So having cleared that hurdle, i was ready to return to ISU for my sophmore year.  That fall, i really hit the bottle hard.  I was drinking Captain Morgan's ALOT before the parties and hitting on girls and in general just being a flagrant asshole of which i was accused.  My fraternity brothers named me ""bulletproof"" because of the number of times i would get shot down and seemingly not care one bit as i would hit on the next one in line.  Well when you are parties where the ratio of girls to guys is about 10:1 and EVERYONE is drunk, you will eventually find that one girl who bites.  The first girl's name was Kristina.  Kristina was a blonde bombshell.  She was extremely outgoing and sorta had a boyfriend who went to IUPUI in Indy (an hour away), but while the cats away, the mice do play, and so one time at a party, and i found myself pinned up against a wall, my shirt open (i was still thin back then) and her kissing all over my chest and then making out with me.  Next thing i know we are back at my Fraternity House, lying in the grass out front, making out and then like a bolt of lightning hits her. she realizes she left her friend alone back at the party.  In a drunken panic, she fled back to the party.  The next day i looked her up and went to her dorm room.  Her roommate happened to be from my hometown (damn small world again) and Kristina explained to me that she didnt know what happened to her and she wanted to stay with her boyfriend.  I told her it was all cool and i understood.  Two weeks later, she was dating an ATO.  So much for the old boyfriend I guess.  

 Shortly after all that happened, I had a visitor come over. Her name was Kirsten, but we all called her Kiwi. She was from my High School and frequented the art classes that i was in.  She was a few years younger than me, but still a cutie.  To be honest, I really don't know how she found me or why, but she claims she came to visit to show off her new tatoo, which was (strangely) the ""pooka"" symbol from World of Darkness: Changeling.  It was on the small of her back and well done and Kiwi was proud.  We rented a movie and chatted and caught up on old times and gossip about Paris.  Then it sort of dawned on me that she wasn't planning on leaving.  Now down inside, a part of me really wanted to take advantage of this.  So i invited her up to my room, into my bed and then the unthinkable happened.  I developed a conscience.  Kiwi, from the time i had first met her, was like a little sister to me.  She was the cool little gamer chick that hung out with all us gamer geeks and we loved her for it.  I just couldn't do it. So we slept there, together, in my bed, but neither of us pushed for anything beyond that.  The next day, i took her home. 

 A month or so later ( yeah Sophmore year was a busy year for me) my fraternity got paired up with Sigma Kappa for Homecoming.  That was how I first met Nina.  Nina was not an overly attractive girl.  She wasn't hideous by any means, but she was a FREAK.  Tongue rings, eyebrow piercings, and a real party girl. In the span of 7 days, she had slept with 5 of my Fraternity Brothers and unbeknownst to me, i was to be next. 

 How things went down was that after a few long hours of building a float for the parade, a bunch of us retreated to an apartment for drinks. My esteemed colleague, Josh Goldman, had acquired a variety of drinks ranging from Aftershock to Boone's Farm to Southern Comfort.  Well. I was quite well known for my iron stomach and high tollerance, so i had Josh make up several suicide drinks in a standard Solo Cup size glass.  I then downed them, one by one, in a single chugfest.  To the amazement and cheers of the group, I was still alive and kicking and preceeded to play some RBI baseball with one of the other Brothers, in which we took shots when the other scored and afte two innings, i had lost 12-1.  by this time, it was still early, but i was checking out.  I was on the couch and the world was spinning. It was then, that she came to me.  She sat on the couch and leaned over me and said, ""Whenever you are ready to go, let me know and I will take you home.""  I remember nodding okay to her, thinking she meant back to my Fraternity House... that is where my HOME was right?  Well i told her i was ready and she helped me up off the couch. I remember leaving the apartment and walking across the large parking lot back onto campus. We entered Jones Hall and got on the elevator.  Somehow, I was still out of it enough to not realize what was going down.  I was then taken into her room and laid down onto a futon matress underneath a loft bed.  The world was still spinning and the last thing i remember before passing out, was her hovering over me, naked.  I know i faded in and out during all of it. I don't know how long it lasted or even if it was any good.  I know that the next day i woke up and made the 5 mile walk of shame back the fraternity house.  Never spoke to her again. 

That was November, and well December brought finals and Christmas break, and then January rolled around, upon which the study room in the chapter house was completed.  This meant that we had internet in the house and i took the time to hook up my computer and redownload ICQ (yeah, how many of you remember using that lol) and decided to send out a test message to see if any of my old contacts still used ICQ.  Behold i got only one reply, and it was from Terra.  So i started talking to Terra each night on ICQ and eventually suggested that her and Kari and Joe come up again and visit.  That somehow turned into a date between Terra and I which took place around Valentine's day.  I took her out to Applebees for dinner and we had to wait for an eternity and we ended up cuddled up in the entry way together, almost crushed behind a door.  Next thing I know, we are kissing, and finally, our beeper goes off and we get our table.

"event","Alot of people have told me that I am a bit of a mystery to them. I attribute most of that to lack of true knowledge of me.  I won't lie when I say that I am not the easiest guy in the world to get to truly know.  There are a lot of layers to try and stomach.  Sometimes, even I forget just how many personas I have come to take on at a moments notice. To help remove some of the mystery that seems to surround me, I will give you all very brief ""cliff notes"" version of my life, each segment dedicated to one topic.  feel free to ask any questions, make any comments, or just stalk as you might normally do.  I just hope the few of you who might actually take the time to read, find a greater understanding of who I am really I am behind it all. So without any further ado, I will begin my first segment, and I will even pick an interesting one, just to get you hooked.

"event","So by a freak twist of fate, my schedule weight training and general game talk with the Pan Man turned into a night home with the boy.  No big deal, but it lead to something totally awesome.

 So since the wife had things she had to go take care of for the upcoming wedding this weekend, me and the boy went to a nearby Burger King for some chicken nuggets and french fries (aka things he can eat on the 30 minute drive home).  Well with his meal, comes a toy, and with the movie next week, its Transformer toys, and Chaserman got himself a very cheaply made Optimus Prime.

now that in itself, not really cool, but what is cool, is that Chase can now say ""Optimus Prime"" 

yes, he still leaves out the ""D"" in his ABCs, and sometimes the number 6 doesn't exist in his little mind... but thats mommy's job.  my job to teach him the cool stuff.

"event","Hello everyone.  

  It has been one hell of a busy busy week for me.  

 Friday I got to enjoy a long night of gaming with my Parasite crew, in which i played my Dragon Disciple/Drunken Monk named Merek Brewer (yes he is a bartender/alchemist) who also happens to be mentored by an Ancient Copper Dragon.  So i get the cool prestige class ""Dragon Disciple""  which sort of slowly turns me into a half dragon template with uber bonuses. 

 So Friday night was several hours of kung fu kicking ass on the Scale Brigade (army of dragon kin headed by evil dragons) in the name of Bahamut (God of the Good Dragons). That sort of went on until 5 am.

 So Saturday kinda started off with 5 hours of sleep, then getting up and heading to Paris with the wife and kid for some swimming fun, then a long trip back and heading back out with the Parasite crew for 5 more hours of D&D fun, only this time, kicking the holy hell out of a Great Wyrm White Dragon. Now i was running out of time before the pirate party and so my monk went super saiyon and decided to go out in a blaze of glory by using his wings and his 120 land speed as a monk with haste and expiditous retreat.  One shield spell and a mage armor later... and my monk was rocking the 41 armor class.  GRRRR *flex*

now you take a level 10 monk with 6 levels of Dragon Disciple, who is hasted, has dodge, mobility, spring attack and around 165 hit points and averaging 20 damage a strike with his 25 strength and you stack it against a creature that gets 1 bite, 2 claws, 2 wing slaps, and a tail slap around with a strength score of somewhere around 40, and probably averaging somewhere near 300 hit points, and it starts to look pretty bleak. 

well I will have you know, that it took that Great Wyrm and 5 of his Dragon Kin guards 5 rounds of full attacks to finally drop me. 

so I am fully convinced, that if i had more time, i could have taken it. easily.  

but alas, the Brewer is dead, suvived by his pet copper dragon wyrmling...Sloppy. 

So with my monk dead, it was time to drown my sorrows in some guitar hero at the pirate party in which i rocked some ass for alot of the night.  In part because i love guitar hero, and in part because it curbed my drinking (cant play and drink at the same time) and i had a pretty good time.  YARG!!!! 

So this weekend has been brought to you by the letter ""D"" for Dragons, Drinking, and Dead Monks.  and by the number 5, which kind of had a reoccuring presence this weekend."

"event","So i am at the lab today, working as ussual, when a phone call comes in for me.  I pick up the phone and on the other end is a Detective from Kane County Sheriff's Dept.  The conversation went a little something like this:

Detective Johnson:  Hello, this is Detective Johnson of the Kane County Sheriff's Dept.  Is this Dustin Ogle? 

me:  Yes.

Det. Johnson:  Do you drive a Hyundai Accent? 

me: Yes

Det Johnson:  Have you been involved in any accidents in the past few months.

me:  Yes, I hit a deer not long ago.

Det. Johnson: Where did you hit this deer at? 

me: Shingra La Road, a small backroad between my old house in Fairmount and my new house in Danville, I was selling my old house and had to do some repairs for the buyers and hit the deer on my way home. 

Det. Johnson:  How much damage was done to your car?

me:  It broke the windshield that covers the headlights.  The guys at Carmack Car Capitol told me at first they just needed to change the light bulb, but when they saw it, they said they would have to chage the housing, so it cost me like 300 dollars, so i turned it into my insurance.

Det. Johnson:  And what insurance company do you have?

me:  State Farm,  Terry Elston's Office out of Paris, Il. 

Det. Johnson:  So when did this happen?

me: Well it was before I sold my old house, which i sold on March 20th, so it would have been early March or late February. 

Det. Johnson: Did you file a report to the Sheriff's Office down there?

me: Uh, no, the deer got up and ran off after i clipped it, so i didn't make any report. 

Det. Johnson:  ok. Do you know where Kane County is located?

me:  Um. No. 

Det. Johnson:  It is up near Chicago, have you been to Chicago or the area recently? 

me: Not recently. Last time i was up there would have been last Fall i think for a wedding. 

Det. Johnson:  Ok, well I am going to need you to get ahold of your insurance company and have them call me or fax me.  I am investigating an accident up here in Kane County and the suspect was seen driving a Hyundai Accent.  Since you have a claim of front end damage on your car and you do drive a Hyundai Accent, we cannot rule you out as a suspect in this case. 

me: That must be one hell of an accident.

Det. Johnson:  It is, there was a hit and run and we are trying track down Hyundai owners who have reported front end damage to their cars. 

me: ok, so is there a fax number i can have the Insurance Company fax you the claim?

Det. Johnson:  (gives number and fax number)

me: Ok, do you need the number for Carmax Car Capitol where i had the damage fixed? 

Det. Johnson:  No, i have already contacted them and that was how I got your info. 

me: oh.... ok, well I will have them fax something to you on Monday.

Det. Johnson:  Alright, thank you. 

-end of conversation.

So it is sounding like I am now a suspect in a murder investigation.  All of you are now consorting with a murder suspect.  I would say that this is not the most fucked up thing that has ever happened to me... but i think it might just be.

so now that I am a suspect, hiding out from ""the man"" i called up my resident expert on such things, Mike Evard, who gave me the sound advice of:

""DUDE, ya gotta go where they never suspect you to go, like church.  See the Man always expects you to run, so what you do is you don't fucking go anywhere, just go hang out at like a church, or the YMCA.  They never look at places like that for murder suspects like you.""

me:  ""thanks for the vote of confidence, Mikey."" 

its going to be a long weekend lol."

  I work this coming weekend, which sucks.  You would think that 5 years of working every 4th weekend that i would get used to it, but every time it comes around i dread it and somehow it always lands on a weekend in which there is something else happening. I don't really know why?  Weekends are the easiest days ever.  The clinic is barely open and we don't do anything.  I guess it is because i have to get up an hour earlier than normal.  

 Oh well, hopefully it all will go well.  It also means that i will likely restart writing the next chapter of my book.  I haven't written anything in a while, so im excited to churn out the next chapter.  

If you have any interest in reading my work, let me know.  I believe this weekend I will complete chapter 15.

  Had a great time at the party.  The Matt Fear Kareoke experience was hilarious, especially when he started singing the ""dots"" that are suppose to tell you to drag out the word, and also the ""commas"" which just due to standard English appear in the lyrics.  I haven't laughed quite that hard in some time.

  Poker could have gone better.  Props to Beth, who pwned me on a very lucky river card.  IF I had won that hand, it probably wouldn't have made that much a difference in the end, she could do no wrong the whole night it seemed. 

  Today is Mother's Day.  I actually got off my ass and got my mom a card.  I also got my mother in law a card and two cards for the wifey!  One from me, and one on behalf of Chase. 
Picked her up a book too.  I am almost proud of myself. If only I had duplicated that same ambition in mailing those cards, my mom might have recieved her card today, but she won't, so it seems a phone call will be in order and a nice suprise about 3 days from now.

"event","So to continue the story.

Saturday came early.  630am went to Mary Ann's Diner for breakfast.  I met up there with all the Colony Brothers and the President comes up to me and says ""So Dustin, I got a call from two friends last night who said some of our Grads were out at Cam's last night in suits.  You wouldn't know who they might be would you?"" 

So i replied ""Yes,  I was there.... with the Executive Director and thre Archons."" 

*Presidents face turns pale white and speechless*

so breakfast ends and its time for the first initation ceremony.  Of course, I cannot reveal anything about the ceremony, except tell you that it is way awesome, and if you knew, you would probably be a bit envious of some of the awesome ritual stuff we get to do. 

So the first initation ends and the second one begins... same deal as before, just a different group of guys.  Again, can't say much else except it was the same variety of awesome.  Sorta like watching an awesome movie, then getting to hit ""replay"" and see it again. 

We then had a small lunch break and then back to formal ritual for the Installation of officers.  The 5 cabinet officers were installed - President-Treasurer-Recording Sec- Corresponding Sec - Historian...and then, they went to install me as the Purple Legionnaire for the Chapter.  

again, i can't say much about what that involves, but I can say this... it refers to the canidate elected to be Purple Legionnaire as being a man with ""exceptional endowments""

Now I am in a room full of men, but every man has this 5 year old inside of him and when those words are spoken, the giggling ensues and here I am being sworn in, and all i see are faces trying to hold back laughter, so thus of course, so am I.  Damn giggle-loops.  I did remind the new Chapter Brothers that ""exceptional endowments"" means i get to be a big dick about everything.  They got a good laugh about that.

So we make it through that and we wrap up formal chapter, then it was off to the new Fraternity House to take the tour.  Not alot of interesting stuff happened there, so after that meeting, we got in our tuxes and it was off to the Union for the Chartering Banquet/Pig Dinner.  I had to give a speech at Pig Dinner as PL, giving a report on the status of the Chapter (kinda a State of the Union address). Well the President didn't send me all the info I needed, so i had no notes.  I realized I had one hour before my turn to speak so i got a couple of scratch peices of paper and wrote down notes... sort of.  My note simply said ""Drink 5 Rum and Cokes"".  I wasn't sure what to say, so I did just that.  Drank a few down and then went up and gave one of my better public speeches to date.  I sit back down and the Director of Expansion is seated next to me and he says ""That was pretty good, those your notes?""  I show them to him and he sees the one line of text and busts up laughing. Then he counts the glasses in front of me and realizes i did just what it said.

The rest of the night was a blur of more Rum and Cokes and loud music at Joes Brewery. 

pictures have to tell the rest of the story."

"event","Well one of the best and longest weekends of my life is finally come and gone. 

 On Friday, we pledged 43 men into the Chapter of Chi Iota at the University of Illinois.  The International Fraternity placed a ""no drinking"" policy into effect for Friday night, because of the early start time the next day... so at 10 when it ended, we all went to the hotel and to bed right.... WRONG.

  Let me set the scene for you.  Visiting dignitaries for this event was the Fraternities Executive Director, Archon President, and Archon Counsellor.  It is safe to say that all three of these men could easily be old enough to be my dad, one of them, nearly old enough to be my grandpa.  So the four of us, in suit and tie decided we should walk from the Union to Garcia's pizza... down Green Street.  Well it is safe to say we got some odd looks.

 So we get to Garcias, order our pizza, and yes, thats right. Two glorious pitchers of beer.  We drink them down, share some stories and eat our pizza, when one of the other Chi Iota Graduates enters and tells us that we should join him and go to Cam's.  Local sports bar.  

 So we walked our way to Cams.  We get to Cams and there is a line to get in, and well... we just walk right past the bouncer like we own the place and into the bar, noone stops us and when we enter, i swear that nearly half the room put down their drinks and tried to act like they were not drunk... the other half were totally wasted and in Bulls jerseys as they cheered the Bulls victory over the Heat. 

So a few pitchers of beer later we wrap up and catch cabs to the hotel, but it was indeed an odd odd night. 

The next day 600 am  i went into Mary Ann's Diner to join the soon to be Initiated Brothers for some breakfast and their President comes up to me and says ""So um, I got a call last night from a couple of friends who said some of our Graduates were out at Cam's last night.  Do you know who they were?"" 

I laughed and looked at him and said.. ""Yeah, the Archon President, Vice President, Archon Counsellor and Executive Director.... and me...."" 

The look of sheer terror and disbelief in his eyes said it all.

"event","So as some of you probably know, this coming weekend is huge for me.  For two years I have committed time and effort into restarting the FIJI chapter at U of I. Two years worth of teaching and advising and finally this weekend, the Chi Iota Colony will once again become Chartered as the Chi Iota Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta at the University of Illinois.

  What that means in everyday speak, is that they are here to stay and its my fault and they are throwing a 4 day long party to celebrate all of that. The weekend looks like this.

Friday Night - Union Building - 407 - 6pm - 10pm - Formal Pledging and White Star Reception.

Saturday         - 6am - Breakfast at Mary Ann's Diner
                   7am - First Initiation Ceremony - Hawthorne Suites
                   9am - Second Initiation Ceremony
                   1100 - lunch
                   1200 - Installation of Cabinet Officers and Purple Legionnaire
                  
                   530 - Chartering Dinner/Pig Dinner
                   1100pm - 2am - Party at Joe's Brewery

Sunday             10am - Founders Circle Brunch


So its a busy weekend.  The Fraternity is putting me up in the new Hilton Hotel for free for both Friday and Saturday nights.  I am pretty sure i get my own suite, free roomservice and the works. I was also told that I could bring a date to the Chartering Dinner/Pig Dinner.  Terra couldn't go, so I almost posted that I was looking for an interested person who would like to see me in a tuxedo, dance a time or two, and listen to me give a small speech.

Last one of these type of events i went to, the CEO for Dell Computer Corporation was there.  I watched him talk to one of the Undergrad members and when this CEO learned the young kid could speak fluent Mandarin Chinese, he offered the kid an 80,000 dollar a year job as his personal translator. Right there on the spot. I also got to meet the Founder of ESPN, the CEO of American Airlines, and CEO of Nike (all are FIJIs in their own right).  So not only will some pretty influential people be there, but also all the Archons of the Fraternity, the Executive Director of the Fraternity, and all the sub Directors including the Ritualist, who is a living legend amongst FIJIs. So I am nervous as all hell that I have to give a speech in front of all these people and they are all there because I succeeded at restoring this Chapter. 

Well it turns out that due to seating problems, only the Chartering Memebers will be bringing dates. :(  

So i guess this huge ass hotel room is going to feel pretty big with just me in it. *shrugs*

even in a huge crowd, i still am alone. 

oh well, thats why they invented alcohol and all my drinks are free!"

"event","1. We will start with an easy one... what is my favorite color?

D. Purple

2. I recieved my degree from Indiana State University. What did I get my degree in?

C. Clinical Laboratory Science...(i do however work as a Medical Technologist, so if you guessed that, you can add 1/2 point.)


3. I play a lot of roleplaying games and have played alot of characters, but there is one character I am the most famous for playing, who is it?

A. Zen Crystalfalls - by comparison, i played each of those other characters for about a year or two each, Zen i have played for 12 years. You see his name on alot of the things i do. He was my character name in World of Warcraft, his name is part of my AIM screen name AngelofZen2003, and even this screen name Spirit_of_Zen. I currently am writing a novel on all his adventures called The Tyrant.  So while all those other characters are favorites of mine, Zen is still the gold standard of Dustin characters. 


4. I have said a alot of things in my time, but there is one saying that I am the most known for, and it often gets me into trouble.

B. This could quite possibly be the damdest, coolest..

 I know, it seems harmless, really, but if you hear me every start to say this, stop me before the world comes crashing down.  This saying of mine has become so notorious for trouble that my friends started a forum with that as a name.  Then lightning struck the computer so we made a second forum with that as a name, and it got bugged, so we created a third one and the person hosting it moved away and lost internet connection to host it... if you hear me utter those words... REPENT, the end is near.


5. In the Fraternity world, I joined the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta. Which position in that organization have I NOT held.

D. Historian - During my undergrad days i served as President and Treasurer, the top two spots one can hold.  As a Graduate, i have been the Secretary for the Housing Corp and currently am the Purple Legionnaire for the U of I colony that is being chartered this weekend.


6. In LARP, past and present, I play a Gangrel named Landon Kane. What sports team is proudly sported on Landon's hat? 

E. Dallas Cowboys - This question is sort of a trick one.  Landon's hat has little to do with Landon, but anyone who knows me, knows damn well that the only professional sports team i follow out of all 3 major sports (fuck hockey) is the Dallas Cowboys.  So that is what Landon's hat says on it. 

7. No matter what circle of friends I migrate amongst. I have a favorite mixed alcoholic drink. What are the two ingredients to this drink?

C. Captain Morgan Silver and Sprite - Captain Morgan Silver Spice Rum is hard to find, but if you mix it 50/50 with Sprite, it goes down smooth and taste like Club Soda.  You never know you are drinking rum.  Try it, if you can find it.


8. In my honest opinion, what is the greatest video game ever made?

A. Final Fantasy 7 - World of Warcraft is alot of fun, but its a social setting, like LARP only on computer.  Best video game ever is Final Fantasy 7, and anyone who wishes to argue can go blow themselves.  Nykki, you should have gone with your gut on that answer lol.


9. In what grade did I get kicked out of Catholic School? 

B. Kindergarten -   Ya, it seems impossible right.  You go, you take a nap, you eat some cookies and some Nun reads some scripture, so how could i have messed this up?  Truth be told, I am not fully sure, but I am told it had something to do with my love and fascination with dinosaurs and I brought a T Rex toy to school and apperantly told the Nun that they were real and in museums so i knew they were real. The Nun didn't like that much so she called my mom in for a conference.  Next thing I know, I am in public school  WHEE!!!


10. I have done alot of drinking and have alot of stories. Of all of these TRUE stories about me, which am I most known for?


D. After completing the ""Century Club"" on Spring Break and being the only one who did not throw up, I ran across the beach and dove into the Gulf of Mexico...only to miss as the waves rolled back out and I landed face first in the sand.

Its true, so true, and nearly a decade after that event happened, i get brand new pledges who will come up to me and say ""you are the Graduate who dove and missed an ocean right?""  


10 - WTF you been stalking me my whole life?
9 - OH, you must be my wife.
8 - Will you be my best friend, it would seem you already are.
7 - Good to have friends like you
6 - We tight.
5 - *Nod* Whats up?
4 - Maybe friend is too strong a word, how about aquaintance?
3 - You can pick me out of a line up... maybe.
2 - You know my name, you just can't spell it or say it right.
1 - Why the hell are you even on my Livejournal?
0 - Do I know you?

So there you have it.  Thanks to those with balls enough to play and to all you lurkers out there who didnt reply, deduct 1 from your score that you would have recieved had you posted.  Anyone who did post, can +1, because it means you actually read my LJ."

"event","SO last Friday was suppose to be a long night of me getting completely bombed out of my mind with my Chi Iota Brothers at the CU bars. I get all ready to go and make a few calls to get in touch with the Brothers from the Beta Pi Chapter in Peoria who were coming down for a fun night of drinking. 

 So i drive into CU, and i finally get ahold of the Chapter President who informs me that they are at the U of I relay for life.  Well, not how i invisioned starting my night, but I am always up for a good cause to help counter the various evil deeds that might follow.  So I meet up with the guys there and at around 11 or so, we decide that those of us who can leave are going to hit a bar or two. 

One of the Beta Pi guys needed a ride to where his Brothers were going and so I gave him a lift and he directed me to a small, hole in the wall, hookah bar on Green street.  I have only ever been to a hookah bar once in my life and i don't remember now why i was there that time, but after a bit i realized that it was me and these Beta Pi Brothers... who oddly enough looked identical to the hobbits from Lord of the Rings.

 So as i watched these guys pass around the hookah, i drank down a couple of rum and cokes before i called it a night. 

I guess that is what i get for going out on 4-20.  A night out with the Hobbits, smoking herbs.

If only the bar had been called ""The Green Dragon"" instead of ""The Green Street Cafe"""

other times, it means getting shit faced, mind erased, waking up in a pool of your own vomit, drunk with the Fraternity Brothers.

and just in case its not enough, its slated for next weekend as well when they get Chartered.

When you're talkin to yourself
And nobody's home
You can fool yourself
You came in this world alone
(alone)

So nobody ever told you baby
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to you baby
Guess we'll have to wait and see
One, two

Old at heart but i'm only 28
And i'm much too young
To let love break my heart
Young at heart but it's getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apart


I don't know how you're s'posed
To find me lately
An what more could you ask from me
How could you say that i never needed you
When you took everything
Said you took everything from me


Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait
When no one i know can seem to help me now
Old at heart but i musn't hesitate
If i'm to find my own way out


Still talkin' to myself and nobody's home
(alone)


So nobody ever told us baby
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us baby
Guess we'll have to wait and see


When i find out all the reasons
Maybe i'll find another way
Find another day
With all the changing seasons of my life
Maybe i'll get it right next time
An now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
You're back down on the ground
And you don't talk so loud
An you don't walk so proud
Any more, and what for


Well i jumped into the river too many times
To make it home
I'm out here on my own, an drifting all alone
If it doesn't show give it time
To read between the lines
'cause i see the storm getting closer
And the waves they get so high
Seems everything we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die


I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess i'll have to make it thru, this time
Oh this time
Without you


I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said i was high
But everything we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die"

Today at work, i was in the middle of performing an LS Ratio, which is a 4 hour manual test that determines if a fetus has lungs that will breathe or kill it upon birth.  When the fetus is in distress they draw amniotic fluid and send it to me to do that test.  So its kind of a big deal and if i screw it up, i can kill a newborn fetus.  fun right?  

so its a very time sensative test, lots of pipetting, and incubating and migration periods... and about the worst thing that can happen, would be to have to leave that bench for any long period of time, right?

 so what happens today?  FIRE!    No, this is not a drill.  ITS A FIRE.  

So a while back, if you remember, we failed our fire drill because we all decided to go down with the ship... i mean, after all, I wasn't leaving my bench for a fake emergency when a real one across the street in ER is in progress, so this one was not a drill, it was a fire upstairs, right above us.  

well, management came around and made us all evacuate (which is ironic because the fire drill procedure says not to leave)  but i went... 

thank goodness the test results were not effected... at least i hope...

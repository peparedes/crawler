"event","Boy, time passes fast when you're not paying attention. Maybe I'm just not used to it - everything moved so slow on Ohtori that nothing seemed to happen or change! Not that it was boring, but it just felt so...I don't really have a word for it.

I think there was a holiday recently, because when I went to look for a job, nothing was open. 

There were fireworks, though, which were nice. I don't even <i>remember</i> the last time I saw fireworks! I went up on the roof to get a better look. Someone was having sort of a party up there too. They were kind of strange people, but nice overall, although I didn't talk to them for long.

Hm...what else? I've been investigating the sports teams and playing a little after school, but I think I missed the tryouts. That's okay, I guess - maybe I need to work on organizing myself before I try for something like that.

Maybe after class I'll try to get in touch with some of my friends from home. I do miss them and...who knows, maybe they're wondering where I went off to, anyway. ^^;; For now, I should go to class. Bye!"

"event","I guess I've been a little out of it the past few days...it's just weird trying to get back into the hang of a school schedule. The first few days have been alright though. My teachers are certainly interesting, at least!

I like this place so far, though. Everyone I've met has been friendly and the classes are, well...as interesting as can be expected from school, right? ^^;

Well, there's a little more homework I need to finish before I go to bed, but before that, I got a messenger name like everyone else has been using. It might be easier to get in touch with people this way, right? So if anyone needs me, my name on there is <b>the ever eternal</b>. (I heard it in a song today and it was all I could think of.) So I guess that's it!"

"event","Oh, who am I kidding? I'm too anxious to really sleep - I keep dozing off and waking up... It's driving me nuts!

I've never been in a public school...not that I remember, at least. Everyone seems so nice here so far, but...well, if there's <i>one</i> thing I've learned lately, it's that looks aren't always the truth. I may be a slow learner, but I owe it to myself to say that, I guess...

Well, the schedule isn't so bad at least. I can't quite figure out why I decided not to take fencing...I'm good at it, right? Or maybe I've done enough of that for, you know. A few lifetimes. -__-; ...Ahhh, it's 1:30 already?! I really do need to try and sleep! I'd <i>hate</i> to fall asleep in class on the first day!

I hope Wakaba and Himemiya are doing alright."

Oh, um. Hello! I've never had one of these before, but it looks simple enough so I thought I'd give it a try. It might help me get to know people around here...or something. I hope. ^^;

In any case, hello. ...I already said that, didn't I. Well, my name is Utena Tenjou and I'm...very, very, <i>very</i> new around here, it seems. ^^;;; I guess you could say I just moved here, though (I finally found myself a place to stay! It was a lot tougher to do than I thought...), and I hope to be meeting a lot of the people here soon.

I'll go to the school tomorrow to apply. How are the sports around here? Anything good? It'd be nice to get involved with something like that again."

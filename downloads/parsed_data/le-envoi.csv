Ayisha: Hope you are having/had fun at Six Flags.

Karen: Thank you SO MUCH for the chocolate.  It was completely unexpected and undeserved and completely appreciated.  It made me feel so good (physically and emotionally, ha ha).  The message was short and sweet.  I love you.  Thanks again.

Goodnight, everybody."

"event","God. That was horrible.

<lj-cut text=""Karen, you might not want to read this."">I just woke up from the most AWFUL dream. I dreamt that Keith had killed himself because he thought I didn't approve of him and that I thought he was a bad person/boyfriend. I don't exactly know how he did it, I think he cut himself on purpose in the shower or something and bled to death. I also remember thinking that there was a darker force at work that made him kill himself, maybe the devil or just some evil spirit or something.

Anyway, Karen was sort of in a daze, but I think she just couldn't cry anymore or something. She said it wasn't my fault and that she wasn't that sad because she knew that their love would survive in another realm or something (I guess the afterlife). And another terrible part is that only the two of us knew about it. So I was completely BAWLING for, like, the entire dream... I don't know if it was because I thought I destroyed Karen's life or because I really liked Keith more than I thought I did. God, I felt the WORST I have probably ever felt in a dream.

I wandered around the house sobbing, and ended up sobbing more when I told Karen's dad as he was going upstairs to talk to Karen (she was alone in her room). I wasn't worried that she was going to hurt herself or anything, becuase I knew she wouldn't and she seemed strangely at peace. I went to the kitchen and for some reason Sara Ewald was there and she knew about Keith's death, and we were talking about it but I don't remember what we said. I just remember crying so hard and having the worst feeling in my chest. This entire dream was so bad, seriously.

That's all I remember, and even when I just woke up a few minutes ago, for some reason my eyes started crying and my face cringed like you do when you actually cry, and my nose got all fuzzy feeling too. So I guess maybe I was crying for real during the dream, but it was just weird to wake up crying in real life. You have NO IDEA how absolutely relieved I was when I woke up and realized it was just a dream. Oh, God. I swear, that had to be one of my top 2 WORST DREAMS EVER (the top 1 being my mom dying or something, I can't remember now but I know I've had other ones about terrible losses like this). Phew. So, I guess I'd like the opportunity to say two things:

1.) Karen, I LOVE YOU.
2.) Keith, you're a good guy in my book, so please PLEASE don't think I hate you or anything.</lj-cut>

In other news, KAREN, you DO want to read this...

I GOT YOUR PEANUT BUTTER FUDGE!!!

I bought the biggest amount they offered, which was one pound, and it's boxed and waiting in my fridge. I almost didn't get it for you, either, because by the time we got to the building, it only had 5 minutes left and then it was closing. So I and my friend Danielle were scrambling through the aisles until we finally found it, and I got taken care of almost right away. So I was very relieved! I guess once I find an appropriate package for mailing I will send it to you. I asked the girls behind the counter how long it stayed good for (just incase) and they said a few weeks, so we should be just fine.

That's all I have to say right now."

I love you so dearly and I know you don't think your birthday is a big deal, but I am thankful especially today and every day that you were born and that you came into my life. I love you and miss you so.

I hope your day is good and that you remember how many people care for you and are glad that you're here.

"event","I wish someone would come online so I could talk to them instead of having to post in my journal.  And I'm too lazy to call someone.  So journal entry it is.

Oh my god, I feel like puking.

But that should go at the end of my story.

Okay.

So, over spring break I went to the doctor twice, and both times they had to take blood from me for tests.  They've done ALL these tests on me, trying to figure out what's wrong.

Oh, and here's what's wrong: my joints have been hurting for at least the past month.  It started with my wrists, and we thought I just slept funny.  But then it went to my knees and feet, and then my shoulders, and now it's basically everywhere.  It's not even noticeable when I wake up, but it gets progressively worse throughout the day, especially when I walk/move a lot.

ANYWAY, so I went in and the doctor couldn't tell anything from examining me (I knew that already, my joints don't get inflamed or anything), so he ordered at least seven (I seriously think more) tests to do on my blood.  The girl taking it (the first time) poked a hole in my left arm, didn't like the hole, removed the needle, made another hole in my left arm, and THAT hole only filled up a little over 1 tube.  So she had to stop and go get someone else to try.  The new person poked a hole in my right arm, but this girl did a good job and the rest of the tubes filled up really quickly.

Ok, so that was my first visit over break.  Then the doctor called and said several of my results were weird (like, much higher than normal range and/or not corresponding or something like that) so I had to go back and they took more blood to redo the tests. Same girl (the good one) from last time, another new hole in my right arm, filled up all the tubes right away.  That was the second visit.  It was a little icky feeling, just that my right arm was still sore from the last needle encounter, but I was fine. I'm not afraid of needles and I didn't cry or anything, just winced and didn't look (but I never look).

THEN, on Monday afternoon (yesterday), I came home to a note from my dad that said my mom was coming home at 4:15 to take me BACK to the doctor, because they need EVEN MORE BLOOD. This was because the new results were even weirder than the first ones. ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!! So she came, and I went back, a new girl this time, but she used my right arm again.  Even ickier feeling, but nothing completely awful.  There were only a few tubes this time, and it went quickly.  I was sore last night, and I took some ibuprofen (oh, here's another thing: the doc told me that in order to help the pain I should take 1-3 ibuprofen pills 2x or 3x a day, as needed.) but the ibuprofen isn't helping lately. Ugh.  Not that it ever was, since I ususally just took it before bed and didn't notice it the next morning. Anyway.

Then I was supposed to have another appointment to actually SEE the doctor face-to-face on Wednesday afternoon during school, but then my mom changed it to TODAY, 10:45 am.  So I left school right after 3rd hour (which was lunchtime anyway).  We went to the doctor, but didn't see him for very long.  He basically said that my results are just getting worse and worse (but we've ruled out a few diseases I guess, and now we're focusing on my liver enzymes).  He said that my liver is enlarged (I think that's the word he used, but basically he meant bigger than normal, haha), which techically is called ""hepatitis.""  So I have hepatitis.

Now, I know what you may be thinking, but here's what he said... he said that the different Hepatitis (A, B, and C, mainly) are called different letters because they come from specific causes (A is from foods, B is from a specific virus, and C is from needles, and so on), but we've ruled out that I don't have Hepatitis A, B, or C, so now we have to try to find the cause.  He said told us that he expects, eventually, that my really high blood tests will ""peak"" and then start coming down again (meaning that I'll be getting better), so he wanted to test AGAIN TODAY FOR BLOOD and he also wanted to check for a few other viruses.

So I had to give more blood today, even MORE TUBES than the very first day (there had to be at LEAST eight today!).  I had a completely different girl take it today, but then the good one from the first and second time showed up and basically just watched the new girl do it.  The new girl apparently used a smaller needle (my mom thinks) because I barely felt it go in, and she did a good job as far as filling up all of those tubes really quickly.  Oh, and it was in my RIGHT ARM, AGAIN, so I thought it was going to be so yucky but it wasn't that bad.  I guess my vein sticks out more in my right arm than my left (sorry if that grosses anyone out) but it's probably just because I use my right arm more.

THEN, the doctor wanted me to have an ultrasound done on my liver today!  So he had to refer us, and we made an appointment for today at a hospital in Waukesha.  And it was only about an hour and a half from when we made it, so there was literally no possible way of going back to school (oh darn!).  Here's the REAL bummer, though:  I was all excited about getting done because I thought we could go stop for lunch and go home afterward, but NO!  Because apparently for this ultrasound, I wasn't supposed to have eaten or drank anything for SIX TO EIGHT HOURS.  And I did have breakfast, but it was okay, it just meant that I couldn't have lunch until after my ultrasound!  I was so sad, seriously!  I was hungry and thirsty even before I knew about the ultrasound.  I COULDN'T EVEN DRINK WATER! I was down.  So we came home for about an hour (I think?), I layed on the couch for lack of anything better to do and tried to watch TV.  I think the hunger and dehydration and lack of energy really got to me because I got REALLY tired.  Like, REALLY REALLY tired.  So then I walked the dog quick and we had to leave.

We got there, waited a few minutes, and the nurse came to get me.  My mom asked if she could come (I wanter her to), and she did.  The girl layed me on a cot and squirted this clear goopy gel on my stomach area below my ribs, and moved this plastic thing around on my skin and she saw stuff.  (Don't feel offended because most of you already probably know what an ultrasound is, but it was just weird to me even though I'm not female or pregnant.)  At times the girl kind of pushed hard on my stomach and it felt uncomfortable, but in general it was fine.  But she kept asking me to take in deep breaths and hold them, and after a while to doing that it just got harder and harder to do.  Luckily she told me when she was done and I could breathe normally, because I began to feel light-headed.

Then, she left and got some doctor in there, a guy, and he basically did the same thing.  He just looked over some stuff he thought she overlooked, I guess, I'm not really sure.  And it was okay, but when he told me to hold my breath he never told me when he was done, so I never knew when I could let it out and breathe normally.  A few times I felt REALLY weird while holding my breath, it was scary.  But he basically just said yeah, nothing was really wrong with my liver other than it is enlarged.  Basically the whole reason I had the ultrasound was to make sure my blood vessels around my liver and such were doing okay, because the original doctor was afraid that my liver getting bigger could cause some other problems.  But I guess everything else is okay.

And I was supposed to have voice lessons today from 3:30-4:00, but I called my teacher and told her what was going on, and I wasn't sure if I could make them or not.  And it ended up being like 3:15 when the ultrasound doctor was done with me, so there was no way we could have made it.  I was kind of relieved, because I was so exhausted by that time, but I also felt bad like I was neglecting my duties.  I hope my teacher understands.

Anyway, I was really happy by this time because my mom said we could go out to eat right away (we were both STARVING).  Before we left, though, the ultrasound nurse called my original doctor and told him how everything went, and he apparently said that it was fine and he would talk to us again tomorrow about how my NEW blood work was going. So we will see.

So we left and went to Fazoli's, and I totally PIGGED OUT like there was no tomorrow, and now I feel sick. Haha.

So THAT is why I feel like puking.  But it's not as bad as when I started this entry, because this is a REALLY long entry and my stomach is not hurting as much.

God, I had such a... crummy day. Yeah, overall it was crummy.  No real answers, nothing to help my joint pain in the meantime, nothing.  But I guess I have to be patient.

I am so tired right now, I am going to go take my contacts out and sleep for an hour or so.

You never talk to her anymore because you can't 'just be friends' (the only way you knew her before was romantic).
Yet you think of her at times, wonder how she's doing, if she thinks the same about you.
Of course, when you do see her as is bound to happen, you speak as few and casual words as possible and avert your gaze.
Of course you do this, because you feel a vague sense of shame (though you don't know why, and your self-esteem tells you not to), and somehow you still want her to think highly of you, admire you, love you.
You don't love her anymore, but the feelings you get when you see her make you question yourself.
(You already know the answer.)
You want her to love you, because if she has moved on or resented you or--God forbid--forgotten you, you will suddenly feel a new but long-awaited sense of worthlessness, that you are not 'good' enough to still have people want you.

Maybe you're not worth it, after all.

"event","<small><center><br>o.k.&nbsp&nbspso, she called yesterday evening, maybe around 6 or so.&nbsp&nbspi had apparently written down for her that we were leaving on <i>Thursday</i> instead of <i>Tuesday</i>.<b>uh-oh</b>well, she said that it was fine and that she and Keith were coming home early this morning.

i finished packing little odds and ends this morning, things that i couldn't have packed before today like my face wash and medication, contacts, etc.&nbsp&nbspi also finished putting junk away that's been laying around my room.&nbsp&nbspit actually looks clean right now, contrary to how slowly it was getting that way these past few days.&nbsp&nbspi don't know why, but for some reason the apperance of clean rooms always makes me feel happy.

my dad surprised my brother and i this morning by offering to take us out for lunch.&nbsp&nbspi suggested Subway, so that's where we went.&nbsp&nbsphe had some expired coupons that he wanted to use, but we thought he was kidding.&nbsp&nbspafter being difficult to the employees, my dad gave the cashier his coupons and she used them!&nbsp&nbspi guess it's a good thing because it seemed like he was going to be upset about the total cost when we were done ordering.

i apologize ahead of time for this entry, because i'm being <b>really</b> distracted by the radio even though i actually like none of these songs.&nbsp&nbspgoodbye everyone, see you Friday or Saturday.

<i>i'll miss you, Liz and Jessika.&nbsp&nbspand Sheppy.</i>"

i'm a little stressed out because i don't know when Karen's coming home.&nbsp&nbspshe posted in her <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/fallenangelgrl/"">journal</a> that she was coming home on Tuesday, but it didn't say what time.&nbsp&nbspsince she's in Green Bay, i had no way to get a hold of her.

i tried calling her house all weekend, hoping to get Keith's number from one of her parents, but they didn't get home [from somewhere] until Sunday.&nbsp&nbspi called once i got it, but no one answered so i left a message asking her to call me a.s.a.p.

well, still no word from Karen and i'm starting to get worried.&nbsp&nbspshe has to be home, packed, and ready to leave by 1:30 tomorrow afternoon.&nbsp&nbspmy mom already said she's not waiting if Karen isn't home by then.&nbsp&nbspi'd be <b>really upset</b> if she didn't come.&nbsp&nbspi know i'm overreacting a little ahead of time, but if this happens it's probably going to ruin my entire trip.

on a more positive note, my dad just sort of walked into my room this morning and gave me $20.&nbsp&nbsphe didn't really say why, only, ""here's some money.""&nbsp&nbsphey, no complaints here.<br></small>"

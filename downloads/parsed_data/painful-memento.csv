We had a possum in our garage the night of the party o.o. Im so mad mom didnt wake me up so I could see it before she opened the door to let it out. It was a baby D:

PARTY PICTURES :D
Unfortunately, I didnt have the camera on me the whole time to catch the bursts of insanity. Like when my sister and 2 other people chased me around to shove cake in my face :P

This is pocky, and her MOM, Yuffie the Pomeranian. Hard to believe, right? It's true. And yes, my cousin named Yuffie after Yuffie from FF. *rolls eyes*

Raja, the rat, and Copper were having a stare down. xD

This was absolutely a shocker to see. Pooter, the cat, hates our dogs. He was probally mad I kept throwing him off the computer monitor, and using Copper for warmth though. Its cute, nonetheless.

This one speaks for itself.
I mean, come on. I named her after Dark, for god's sake.

ANYWAY. Yeah. Enjoy. X3"

program: Photoshop cs2
translateable: probally not
level: basic knowledge needed

<lj-cut>
Awhile ago, I saw a post from <lj user=""pinkxdepression"">  who wanted to know how someone did this sort of effect, so I decided to take a shot, since I knew it pretty well and it looked easy.

<img border=""0"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"" src=""http://img151.imageshack.us/img151/1880/potcmn7.png"" />
1. Get your images together in a nice neat order.
2. Layer: Flatten Image [or crtl+E to merge layers down together]
3. Image: Adjustments: Desaturate layer [Crtl+shift+U]
4. Depending on Image quality: duplicate layer: set to screen
5. Duplicate layer: Set to soft light
6. New layer: Go to the <a href=""http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h166/banners_R_us/gradient.png"">Gradient tool</a>  in the tool menu, and find the gradient you want to use, I used <a href=""http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/4687/gradientcolorue6.png"">This</a>
7. Pull the gradient in a straight, horizontal line across the image: Set the layer to soft light
8. Duplicate the gradient layer: Set to lighten: and play with the opacity. Mine's at 75
9. Now, set <a href=""http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h166/banners_R_us/pattern.png"">this</a> as a new pattern. Edit: Define pattern
10. New layer: Use bucket tool: set the fill settings from foreground to pattern and fill the image with the pattern from 9. Set to soft light and play with settings.
11. If you can't see your image very well, duplicate the base, drag it to the top, and set to soft light.

12. And your done! Just add other things because Im tired and don't care anymore X]

But if you want to know how to do the text I did, ask, and Ill add that later when Im conscience.

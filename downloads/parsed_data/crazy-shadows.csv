Do you value women? Do you cherish them as gifts from God?
Do you respect the fact that her body is not there to just to please you and it is in fact a wonderful gift for her husband?
Do you love her for who she is? Do you realize there is more to her than a nice bod and a cute face? Do you know the complexities of a woman's heart and appreciate that?"

I mean it's totally obvious what a woman wants in a man. Even though men think it's a mystery.

My body, for example. I don't work out hardly ever. I think I'm fat. In my mind I deserve to be fat because I dont' work out and  i dont' watch what I eat. So therefore, whether it's true or not, I think I'm fat. Also the same thing with grades. I have decent grades, but upon looking at the list of the peopel that i know that got Straight A's last semester I start feeling dumpy about the grades I got. I think to myself ""maybe if I had tried harder and studied more. It's my own fault. I'm just lazy and stupid."" Even though my grades are pretty good. 
The thing is about how I look though. I could be extremely gorgeous and I would get attention. But the thing is there are about 1,000 other extremely gorgeous women at OBU. Who the heck cares? Why would I be any different than them. I'd be one of the many. So I guess the only thing I should measure myself by is my character and my unique personality. But I ask one thing. Why is it so hard to do that?"

It was sparkly and blue with diamonds in it and it smelled like blueberries. Megan took its poop to a national science museum and tried to sell it but no one believed it was poop. So she took it to her father's chemistry lab. He said he had never seen anything so beautiful and rare but it was not poop. Megan cried for nights and cried out to God ""God why do they persecute me? Why wont' they believe me? I know that this is a new scientific discovery!"" God answered her the next night, ""Megan no one believes you because you are wrong. It's not poop. And Mr. Jiggles is NOT a real turkey. What you have discovered a Thanksgiving play-do machine that looks like a turkey. Of course it's pretty poop, why would kids want to play with real poop? Ok scratch that. Anyway. Sorry Megan. But it's just a toy. Now go back to Africa and tell some more people about Jesus!"" ""Yes sir!"" she said, and Megan saved many a person.

It always results in rejection or them being like sorry we're doing something already or them already having something to do and feel like they are obligated to invite me because I already know what they're doing. So blah. This is crap."

I'm gonna play cards or watch a movie and probably eat the food bc the pizza is not going to get here fast enough. GRR. Emily and Shannon need to get back before I puke."

"event","Um...hey dudes. Counseling is really helping me. I""m supposed to be thinking of positive thoughts or something. I don't know. It's kinda hard when people rip on me all the time. Um blah, I'm still worked up about something. I REALLY want a new voice teacher. And I'm seriously gonna get real fed up if they won't let me switch. I'm seriously gonna be like hello I pay $20 effing thousand bucks to go here a year and I can't have the voice teacher I want in order to become a better singer. Isn't that what I came here for? If they really don't care I'm packing up and hauling it back to the good part of the state. Thanks dudes. bye"

"event","Ok. Sorry I haven't posted in awhile. I hope you all liked the Keely and Judd stories, despite how bizarre they were. I haven't been feeling well lately. On the inside. I just feel like crying all the time. I don't want to do anything normal anymore. I'm seeking counseling now to help me find out what's wrong. I have an appointment in about an hour to see the school counselor. I'm really afraid that I'll either clam up and not talk or that I'll start crying or something. I hate crying. I'm sick of it. I""m also physically sleepy.
I didn't really want to share all of this with everyone but since you are all my friends and I've pretty much talked to all of you about my anxiety stuff, I figured oh well. I do want you to know I'm getting help for it. It makes me feel like a nutcase though. I dont want y'all to think I'm crazy. Well that's all I think I can bear to reveal to you.Bye now."

"event","I am tired of Liberal Arts. I would like to puke on all these theories and make cats eat them. I hate studying and I hate classes. I also hate waking up early. 

I voted for Bush today. And Blance Lincoln. Lincoln won. So therefore, I have power and Bush is gonna win too. 

It rained and was very cold. The wind blew so it was worse. I wanted to wear a big ski mask. 

I went to the watch party. It was fun. I ate some really good popcorn.  I didn't win a prize. Darn. But it was fun.

I've eaten so much candy this week my teeth are probably going to rot and fall out. 

OH yeah. My weekend was fun. I got to see Neil on Friday when i got there. We met at the game then left an hour later and went to my house. Saturday stuff got all messed up. I was suppsoed to bring Neil over to Hannah's Halloween party but his parents wouldn't let him. So I ended up feeling like a total jerk and going to Denny's to meet him and his parents. But they left after awhile. Neil and I talked in this granny car that I drove all weekend that isn't ours. Then on Sunday I went to church w/him. I met Allison. She's gonna spend the night w/me on Thursday for Scope. Yay! I'm so excited. Then Neil came over for lunch. Then sadly I went back to Arkadelphia. Blah."

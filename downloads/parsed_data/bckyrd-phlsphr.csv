"event","I walked home from work today.&nbsp; We got a couple inches of snow throughout the day and it's the fluffy, white, powder kind.&nbsp; It snowed all day, right up until it was time for me to walk home at 9:30 so I tipped my hat to the sky as I left the coffee shop behind and started my journey home.&nbsp; The snow crunched under my feet with every step I took and I was happier than I've been in a long time. 

Today I paid rent by scraping together all the change in my room and depositing it into my bank account.&nbsp;&nbsp;My rent is&nbsp;$390 a month and&nbsp;after depositing&nbsp;$12.37 in change I had&nbsp;$392.46&nbsp;in my account,&nbsp;and I have eight dollars in my wallet.&nbsp; It was the money left over from my tips&nbsp;after I paid for the soup and cookie I ate at work tonight.&nbsp; I now have to decide between going&nbsp;to my parents for Christmas&nbsp;or paying rent next month.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I'll have to pay my phone bill with my credit card and I'm not sure how I'll pay off the credit card after that.&nbsp; I've been eating boxed macaroni and cheese and cambell's chicken noodle soup for the last week.&nbsp; But somehow, I am happier than I've been in a long time. 

I know why.&nbsp; I figured it out on the way home.&nbsp; I am going to change my life.&nbsp; I'm either going to make a difference by changing the environment around me so I am happy (which I doubt will happen) or I am going to go to an environment that will better suit me... such as England or Australia.&nbsp; Maybe even Canada would be better.&nbsp; Anywhere that I can get away from the typical conservative Americans that shit on other countries, wipe their ass with their flag, and then pretend like nothing happened.&nbsp; Pretty much a ""fuck you...&nbsp;but have a nice day"" attitude. 

There's a whole lot of places I am tempted to go from there, but those conversations are meant to be had in person, not on an online journal."

"event","Here's a catch-up version of my life.

Over the last four weeks I've learned a lot.  I've learned that it is possible to stretch yourself too thin even if you are only 21.  I've learned that it may be a good idea to not date people who tell you on the first night you meet them, ""I want to have kids and get married in the next couple of years,"" if you don't intend to do the same, and that those people tend to turn towards being a stalker when you end that relationship after two weeks.  I've learned that friends you haven't seen for a long time can suddenly become a big part of your life again.  Most importantly, I've learned to never give up on people who haven't yet given up on themselves; they may end up being there for YOU later on, and let me tell you... that is humbling.

Over-all it was worth it.  I can't ask for any more out of the last four weeks.  If anything can be said to sum it up... it's that in these last four weeks I've felt more alive than I have in the last couple years.

Now I need to provide you with a personal definition of ""alive.""  I've been uncomfortable, drunk, tired, and stressed out for the longest period of time since the army days.  It's in moments of extreme emotion that I feel the most ""alive"" because I know that even though those moments sometimes suck, I am going to learn something from them and I am going to grow from them.  Plus, it reminds me that life does suck sometimes but it's part of livingt.

Alive - Experiencing every part of life, the good and the bad, the beautiful and the ugly, the familiar and the unknown.

If I had money I would be ""far away"" right now."

"event","The outdoors were not presenting their hospitable side when I decided to head out on a short walk to the movie store. It would be worth it: an afternoon in front of a couple good movies that would make me laugh in exchange for a few minutes of excruciating wind chill on my scarfless face. I guess I shouldn't leave important items of clothing at the house of someone I've only been dating for two weeks. Especially when you are thinking about and are leaning towards a scenario she would not be happy with.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>I can have a nice afternoon and I will tell her how I feel tomorrow,</em> I thought to myself.&nbsp; So I put on a sweatshirt and a coat over the sweatshirt, getting ready to walk the three blocks to the movie store.<br /><br />Stepping out the front door to my house, the wind hit the side of my face and immediately forced me to put my hood up or face the threat of frost bit.&nbsp; <em>Shit, it's cold today!</em>&nbsp; I thought, and took the first few steps of my journey.<br /><br />Then I turned around, went back into the house, and picked up the movies I needed to return, but forgot to bring with.<br /><br />So I headed out again, slightly warmer than before, but that changed a block from my house.&nbsp; So, I got down to the main street that runs by the movie store and is also a main bus route.&nbsp; Down the street, about eight blocks away, I saw a bus heading for downtown.&nbsp; I quickly returned the movie, after slipping on a patch of ice and almost biffing it in front of the movie store window with my friend that works there watching.&nbsp; I waved to her and ran for the bus stop, reaching it just as the bus was pulling over to the curb a couple blocks away.&nbsp; I was gonna go downtown.&nbsp; In fact, I was gonna go downtown and let the girl I have been dating for the last two weeks know that she scares me.<br /><br />For all you guys out there, you know there is not a good way to get rid of a girl that is talking about having you children two weeks after you meet her at a bar, but I had thought about it a lot and I knew what to say... for the most part.&nbsp; So I rode the bus down to the station and tuned in my iPod to play the Deftones.&nbsp; I haven't been able to get enough of them in the couple weeks which is funny because until I dug out the ""Around the Fur"" CD at my parents house when I was home for Thanksgiving, I hadn't listened to them since early high school.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching the people on the bus.&nbsp; I was blessed by the presence of a woman with down syndrome getting on and&nbsp;sitting at the front of the bus.&nbsp; She had the exact same conversation with every single person that got on the bus after her.<br /><br />Woman - ""Hello.""<br />Stranger - ""Uh, hi...""<br />Woman - ""It's not too bad outside today.""<br />Stranger - *Smiling* ""You're right, it could be worse.""<br />Woman - ""You're right, it could ALWAYS be worse. But today the sun is out""<br /><br />What a gift indeed.<br /><br />By this time we had reached my destination and I got off the bus and immediately went into the building I was dropped off at and headed towards the famous Duluth Skywalk.&nbsp; Making my way through the DECC took about ten minutes and I finally reached the far exit.&nbsp; Exiting the DECC and heading across the Vista Fleet bridge, I made my way across the Grandma's parking lot in canal park and over the lift bridge towards the house of the woman that had so quickly devoted every&nbsp;concious and subconcious&nbsp;moment&nbsp;of the last two weeks of her life to either me or thinking about me.<br /><br />It was too much.&nbsp; I don't want to get married and I don't want kids in the next couple years.&nbsp; I DO want to get married SOMEDAY and I would LOVE children, but right now I just don't have the funds to provide for either.&nbsp; Plus, I am in the army reserve and I won't take the chance that I could get called back to Iraq and have to leave my wife and kids with a chance I may not come back.<br /><br />I will wait, but she can't.&nbsp; Unfortunately, she'll have to find someone that doesn't want to wait any longer.&nbsp; Not that I can blame her.&nbsp; She is 26 and a lot of her friends have kids of their own.&nbsp; But I want to go to Europe, I want to go to Australia, I want to see the world... and all&nbsp;she wants to settle down and start a family.&nbsp; As much as a family IS an adventure, I need to get a few other adventures out of the way before I start that one.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm there, at the door to her apartment.&nbsp; <em>How the fuck did I end up here?</em>&nbsp; I thought to myself.&nbsp; <em>I don't want to be here right now, I want to be watching Accepted and drinking a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon.<br /><br /></em>Then I knew why I was there.&nbsp; <em>My subconscious has brought me to where I should be once again, and even though today was suppose to be a drama free, relaxing day, it wasn't going to be.&nbsp; </em>In my experience, drama isn't very stealthy, but still&nbsp;very painful.&nbsp; Like freight train, it can't be stopped and all you can do is watch as it gets closer and closer to the spot where you've been tied to the tracks and left for dead.<br /><br />So there was my freight train, about to hit me, and it didn't even have it's brakes on.&nbsp; It came in the shape of a 26 year old woman whom I will call Alaina.&nbsp; After graduating from St.Catherine's&nbsp;with a major in psychology, she now has two DUI's, is on probation, is currently still drinking excessive amounts of wine on a regular basis,&nbsp;and on&nbsp;the night we met&nbsp;it was the first night without her&nbsp;ankle bracelet.&nbsp; She had it on for 2 months.&nbsp; I know how to pick 'em, huh?<br /><br />I knocked twice and let myself in.&nbsp; She was in the living room watching Desperate Housewives on DVD.&nbsp; Her face lit up when she saw me because she had not been expecting me.&nbsp; She ran for the door and before I could get my shoes off she had forced herself into my arms and had wrapped her legs around the small of my back.<br /><br />I had to let her down but it was gonna be hard.&nbsp; I was reminded of the time I hit a cat with my car.&nbsp; Which is another story in itself, but long story short, I hit a cat, felt bad about it, took pity on the fact that it was still alive, and backed up and ran it over again to kill it.<br /><br />This happy young woman was about to be reduced to a pile of sobs, tears, and raw emotion, and neither of us knew it yet.<br /><br />I let go of her and sat down on the couch.&nbsp; She wasn't far behind with a freshly poured glass of Brita water.&nbsp; She set it down on the living room table and grabbed me, curling up with me on the couch.&nbsp; This was gonna hurt.<br /><br />""I don't think we should see each other anymore,"" I said.<br />She looked up at me in disbelief.&nbsp; ""What?""<br />""I want to be your friend, Alaina, but I can't lead you on anymore, we don't want the same thing.""<br />""I can change what I want, I can be what you want, just give me time,"" she pleaded, as tears came to her eyes.<br />""I refuse to love someone for who I want them to be.&nbsp; I only love people for who they are... or not at all.&nbsp; I think I could love you if you were just my friend, but I can't love you as anything more.""<br />""So there's no chance of me talking you out of this?&nbsp; Can't we just wait another couple weeks and see what happens?""<br />""You won't change, hun, and I don't want you to change the good things about yourself.&nbsp; You know what you want, and you're not afraid to go out and get it, so forget about me and get something you REALLY want.""<br />""I really&nbsp;love you.""<br />""No, you're in love with being in love.&nbsp; I've already made up my mind.&nbsp; There's no changing it.&nbsp; It's over.&nbsp; We're just friends.""<br />""Will you stay here with me tonight?""<br />""No, I have class tomorrow morning and I really don't think it would be constructive for our new relationship as friends if I stayed here tonight.&nbsp; I need to go, I have class at three.&nbsp; I'll give you a call when I'm ready to talk to you again, but you've suffocated and&nbsp;angered&nbsp;me over the past week and I can't be around you for a few days.&nbsp; Don't call me, I promise I will call you back eventually.&nbsp; I just need time.""<br />I got up to leave and she stayed on the couch, tears streaking down her cheeks.I got my scarf from her room and then put it on, as well as my shoes.<br />""Goodbye,"" I said, and closed the door.<br /><br /><em>Ouch<br /><br /></em>The train had reached me.&nbsp; It hit me, hard, and I still had a long walk to get to my hospital... which in this case consisted of my bed and a t.v.&nbsp; I made the never-ending walk back through the skywalk and to the transit center.&nbsp; I got the next bus that would take me three blocks from my house and I went back to the movie store.&nbsp; When I went to the counter to check out Accepted and Ellie Parker my friend greeted me with a smile.<br /><br />""Must be cold outside today?"" she asked.<br />""It could ALWAYS be worse.&nbsp; At least the sun's out,"" I said, and headed for home."

So, since I hadn't been on in such a long time, I figured I would log on and see what's up, update a few things, and try to convince myself I'll actually write in this on a regular basis from now on.  Anyways, I guess to sum up what's been going on in my life lately is easy.... there are precious few people in my life that are not going crazy.  To all you who aren't loosing your marbles... you're awesome right now.  To all of you who are going crazy... please come back, cuz you're slowly loosin me forever.  I know a couple people will see this and wonder if I'm talking about them.  If you're wondering, then in all honesty it IS you.
Now that's out so I can move on.
The file on my computer that contains the book I'm writing was last updated on Aug. 12, 2006.  That's sad cause that was just for minor grammar changes... I didn't actually write anything.  I need to get on the ball with that thing before I lose my interest.
I hate people with two faces, and even more... I hate people with an endless amount of faces.  I understand having a fake name on your journal to prevent internet stalkers... I do.  But PLEASE!  Having more than one livejournal account with different personalities in each?  WTF is the point unless you're a psycho  schizophrenic?  Oh well, I guess it's something I'll have to get over.  Fucking crazies.

Since last time I logged on I...
Have a new girlfriend.
Have moved to a different house.
Have new friends.
Lost all my old friends.
Have a job.
Don't have a car.
Still hate school.
Have completed my transformation to a hippy.

Huzzah.

The End."

"event","Well, it's that time of the year when I, due to lack of sunlight, get depressed and start to think not-so-good thoughts about life.  I decided that I am going to go to the pet store tomorrow and find out if those natural light, light bulbs work for humans AND animals, because I need something to make this seasonal depression go away.  Of course it doesn't help that I can't do any of the things that used to cure it, like go out to my favorite places in Duluth and enjoy the view, or just go driving and sing in the car.  Just in case you didn't know, my car died on the last few days of break and I don't have one anymore.  Not only that, but I can't even buy one until I get a job and make some money.  On top of that, how the hell am I suppose to go to work when I don't have a car and there aren't any places within walking distance?  Grrrrr.  Well, earlier tonight I needed to get out so I decided that I would go for a walk.  The walk ended up lasting for two hours.  Yes, in the snow and cold.  I didn't care, I was warm and I needed to do SOMETHING to get out of the house and move around a little bit.  Well, hopefully I get this job that I applied for at Caribou Coffee.  Just keepin' my fingers crossed.  Now it's time for bed.  At least I have one thing to look forward to.  I just did laundry today and my bedsheets smell like a ""Mountain Spring.""

"event","""All my devotion betrayed
I am no longer afraid
I was too blinded to see
How much you've stolen from me""
Disturbed - ""Deify""

I am with what has been my best friend over Christmas break, my laptop, and I am at a coffee shop which I don't particularly like but they have wireless internet so they will do for now.  I've been a floater for the past few days, not staying anywhere (with the exception of sleeping) for longer than a couple hours.  I think its because something in me has become restless.  I have no idea how to explain the feeling, other than I feel like something that has been sleeping inside me for a long time wants to wake up.  By the small amounts of it that I have been experiencing, I can't wait for it to awaken.  It feels like a large amount of energy that not only wants to be let out, but wants to use me for something.  I can't wait!
Until then, I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully if there is a way I can help it along, it'll let me know because I have no clue.  I keep asking myself if there is anything that I feel the need to do or get out of the way, but the answer is always no, so I continue what I am doing and day by day the feeling grows stronger.
In other news, I did a very adult thing today and I am proud of myself for it.  I texted my ex and asked her how she has been doing lately, AND I was genuinely interested, THEN talked to her on the phone for about five minutes.  In other words, I wasn't faking it.  I think it lowered my hatred of her, and I may actually be able to stand being in her presence at some point in the not-so-near future if I continue this.  The reason that I have even bothered trying to get myself to not hate her is because although she may deserve it, she doesn't deserve to be hated forever and there is already enough hate in this world that I have to deal with.  Why should I put more into it that, although justified, is unnecessary?  There is no logical reason that I could come up with, so away it goes along with all the hatred that goes with her and her friends.  They are not a part of my life anymore, so the emotions from them have to leave as well.
Wow, good thing I have a place to write all this down.  I did come to a realization just now.  That thing inside me that wants to be let loose is being blocked by hatred and gradually I have been letting it go so it is coming out.  Sometimes I guess I just need the answers written out and sitting in front of me on a computer screen.
I told one of my friends from my unit today that if she ever got deployed I would volunteer to go with.  That's right, I said it.  And I meant it to.  I figure my odds of getting deployed at some point in the future are pretty good and I would like to go with someone that I get along with and can have fun with, so why the hell not?  Plus, I would make a little money and have a little fun along the way.  I know money doesn't by happiness but, sadly, it buys a lot of other stuff that would make my life easier.
Well, now that I went off on all that I forgot what I wanted to write about in the first place so there will be more... maybe later tonight and maybe another day.  Later.

-Spill Canvas - ""Polygraph Right Now""

No, that is not the mood that I am in right now, I am just listening to the song for whatever reason.  If you don't know who Spill Canvas is you should definately take the time to look them up.  The lead singer/songwriter is a genius.
So here I am, sitting in front of my computer at three in the morning and typing on Live Journal.  My mood is a good mood.  I had a great day today, and am having an awesome time talking to a friend of mine on MSN Messenger that I have not had the opportunity to talk to for a couple years now.  Me and her share a lot of the same beliefs and interests.  I am betting that she will read this and know who she is too.  :)  I love connecting with people that have the same beliefs and thoughts as I do.  Of course I do; who doesn't, right?  But I am not sure that other people get quite the same thrill out of it as I do.
And the coffee still courses through my veins.
So I continue writing.
One of the main characters in my book surprised me today when he kinda flew off the handle.  I didn't expect him to do that, but that is the beauty of having defined character personalities before starting a book.  The characters do things that surprise even the writer.  My main character, Keegan, was just being protective of his friends and sister, so I can't blame him for getting pissed in this case.  I think I would have done the same thing, but Keegan is usually such a calm-minded guy...  Is it bad to talk about characters in a book you are writing like they're real?  If it is, let me know and I'll stop... making my journal entries about my characters public that is...  :)  Honestly.
I think my parents computer in the other room is possessed.  It just restarted itself for no reason and no one is downstairs except me.  Wierd.  Now both my parents computer and my phone are possessed.  Electronics should have spirit shields or something.  Honestly.
So, why is it that 95% of the people that I've met from small towns refuse to accept any beliefs other than the ones they grew up with?  This may seem like I'm trying to be mean or like it is a rhetorical question, but I am in all seriousness, DIEING to know and am not trying to be mean, I am just stating the truth from my experience with small town people.  And then, most of the time they are so nice to your face and then they turn around a talk shit behind your back.  I'd rather have someone punch me in the face, spit on me, and plain tell me they don't like me than have someone that doesn't even know me pretend to be nice to my face and then talk behind my back.  Honestly.
I am 90% sure I have figured out what I want for my next tattoo.  A chain around my ankle with wings on it.  I am not sure how that would look, but I think it would be cool.  It would signify the world (the chain) trying to hold me down and me flying anyways.  Beautiful?  I thought so.  So, let me know what you think of that idea sometime.  Contrary to popular belief (this goes out to you, Michelle) I will actually take your comments into consideration.  Honestly.
But now I have nothing else to write about so I may as well stop.  After all, a man of few words is a scholar indeed, and the man that talks on must be smoking weed.  And I don't smoke weed.

Honestly,

Today I volunteer chaperoned at the youth center that I used to work at in high school.  I have been doing that for the past week, and its been awesome because I have needed something to do desperately and I've been told that I am bringing a lot of positive energy into the youth center and really livening it up a lot.  A win-win situation!  One of the kids flipped out today and started yelling and wouldn't listen to a thing anyone says.  I guess that happens with him a lot because he has emotional behavior problems.  My feel-good moment of the day was when I was able to calm him down and get him back to normal by talking to him.  Highlight of my day right there.
Another highlight of my day was singing in my car.  I know, it sounds funny, but I love doing it.  System of a Down and My Chemical Romance was what I was singing along to.  Great bands and great songs.
Well, this journal entry, as informative as it is as far as what I did today, is boring and I really don't like it.  It didn't fulfill my need to express myself and that is the reason I stated LJ in the first place.  I'll post it anyways, but I'm writing another one right after this because I can't just change my writing style half-way through and make it work... it just wouldn't be right. :)

"event","This post is for everyone that has asked me to tell them what my book is about and I told them that I would put it online eventually.  Yeah, I know it's been a while.  What do you expect, instant gratification?
The time frame is very very far in the future.  Man has expanded to other galaxies and, with space travel, are able to jump from galaxy to galaxy in a matter of hours.  Most of mankind has united under a common banner: The Confederacy.  Earth is only a state in the confederacy.  For those of you that don't know what a confederacy is and are interested, you can go to http://www.civilwarhome.com/csa.htm  Basically, it means that each state has a lot of power and controls itself and its own laws, of which the federal government cannot overrule.
The capital of the Confederacy is Geneva, in the county of Switzerland.  Yes, county, not country.  There are 11 other states (planets) in the Confederacy, and two planets that have split from the confederacy and are trying to form their own government that is similar to the government of the current United States.  Those two planets are trying to help each other set up governments that are separate from each other and that are democracy based.  There is also a lawless planet that claims no allegiance to any government and is ruled by warlords.  The relationships between the two democratic planets and the confederacy is almost at a breaking point.  Our story begins when three of the states of the confederacy (Earth not included) are preparing to invade the two democratic planets.
The main character is Keegan Kale.  He lives in the town of Washington (formerly the state of Washington) by Birch Bay.  (Yes, there really is a town and a body of water in the current state of Washington called Birch Bay.)  Keegan and his friends are psycic.  Ever since humans left the planet Earth and spent long periods of time on neighboring planets, they started to change due to differences in diet, surroundings, slight differences in chemicals in the air, and amount of gravitational pull.  There is a belief that the planets with less gravitational pull ""free your soul from the clutches of gravity and allow it to wander the universe and unite with other souls.""  Keegans family recently moved to Earth, but most of his family line spent generations and generations on a planet called New Earth.  It was the first expansion planet and has the least amount of gravitational pull.  Keegan has very bright blue eyes.
Keegan is the leader of his group of friends which includes his little sister Lahela.  Him and his friends all live within blocks of each other and all their parents are long-time friends.  Keegan is only 10 when the story starts, and Lahela is 8.  Keegan and his friends have psycic powers, which is unknown to anyone but themselves and, unknown to the children, their parents know too.
One day, some wierd creatures appear on Earth and start to grow more and more numerous until an invasion starts and the creatures start to anialate Earth.
That is all the farther I am going.  If you want to know more, you will just have to read the book once I finish it.  Sorry to say, but it could be a while.

Thanks for your time,

"event","I am sitting in the basement of my parent's house next to my dog (it's really my sister's dog, but I like to call it mine because it follows me everywhere whenever I'm home).  It is beautiful outside and I really wish that I had something to do out there.  The tree in the backyard is tempting me to climb it and sit there for hours as I usually do when I'm home, but I know that it's just warm enough to start the snow melting and the tree is going to be wet and crappy so I remain on the couch.  My dog, a springer spaniel named Cali, is trying her best to make it as impossible as she can for to type to my friends on my laptop so I send a quick ""brb"" to all of them, put aside the computer and scratch her belly.
If only my life were that simple.  If all I was worried about was getting a belly scratch once in a while and a couple biscuits here and there my life would be that easy.  Instead, I was not born covered in black and white fur, walking on four legs, and with a black, wet nose that just got my computer screen smudged.  Thanks Cali.  I'll remember that.
Oh, who am I kidding, I won't remember.
On my iPod is Old Blue Eyes singing ""The Last Dance.""  Why do I, a 20 year old college student, like Frankie?  My parents like him, but listen to him so rarely that I never heard him from them.  I guess I just heard him when one of my friends put him on by accident and I loved the music.  Next up on the list is ""Night and Day"" and when that finishes up comes a much-too-up-beat-for-the-moment ""I Get a Kick Out of You.""  Not that I'm in a bad mood, and not that I don't like the song because I love it, but at the moment I am in a thinking mood.  So I skip over ""Luck Be a Lady"" and settle on ""The Way You Look Tonight.""   There are few of my friends that know what my thinking mood entails, and some of them would call that mood crabby, but that is not it at all.  When I get into a thinking mood, the only thing that I want to do is think, whether that be with someone who is also in a thinking mood or is a good thinker, or by myself just contemplating life.
What got me here in the first place is a thought that was sparked in me today.  My political views are liberal, as I just figured out about a month ago, and I started thinking about the war that I just took part in recently.  I am talking about the war in Iraq.  Being there and talking to the Iraqi's and citizens of neighboring countries such as Jordan, Kuwait, Syria, and Pakistan, I realized that no one in the United States is even looking at the opinion of the locals in the area of where the war is happening.  We are only worried about our own damn politics and what our country's leaders need to do in order to look good in the eyes of the American people.  In this case, who gives a damn.  Just because 9/11 happened doesn't mean that we need to go on a killing spree playing the biggest and most literal game of eye for an eye I've ever lived to see.  Sure, the Al Queda and the Taliban are/were some fucked up people.  Sure Saddam killed countless people for no reason.  Is the world better without people like that in it?  Yeah, it is.  But, the point that I am making is this.  The people of Iraq are divided in their views just like people in the United States.  Since I've been back, people always ask me ""what is the view of 'the Iraqis',"" like they all share the same view or something.  They are as split as our country, or at least the ones that I met.  They all agreed that Saddam needed to go, but they didn't all agree about us staying in Iraq for as long as we plan to, and trust me, we'll be there for a LOT longer.  There were three main views on this subject that I ran into.  The first one is that they want us to stay there and help them build a government.  The second is that they want a smaller army there to just keep the peace and not be an ""overwhelming, intimidating force.""  The third, and the minority, wishes that we would have taken down Saddam and left the next week; they believed they could build their own government and take care of everything themselves at that point.  Now, because I HATE debating politics and think that it is pointless, I am not going to tell which side I agree with, but the point I made there is that on EVERY SINGLE SUBJECT, just like us in the U.S. there is a wide range of views and they are usually evenly split.  There is not an ""Iraqi view.""  Just like we have Democrats, Republicans, and a lot of independent parties, so do they, even more so because they have different factions that are hate each other with a passion.
I could keep going and going, but DAMN this update is long and I just realized that I have listened to ""My "",Kind of Town"", ""The Best Is Yet To Come"", ""Fly Me To the Moon"", and am now on ""It was a Very Good Year"".  Maybe I will get into this more another time, and maybe not.  If you want to hear more about my experiences, just ask me or make a comment or something, and I will try to find time.
As always thanks for your time.  Now it is time to start back at ""The Last Dance"", and try to get some sleep.

"event","So I realized that I didn't answer an important question that I posed in my last journal entry.  Why were we put on this planet in the first place?  That is as simple as the other answers.  We were put here to experience everything we can in this world.  Why else would we have been put here?  It was obviously for some purpose.  We pollute and destroy this world, so it wasn't to make the world itself a better place.  At least that is what I like to think because if that is why we were put on this planet we have already failed.  The Earth will never be the same as when it was untouched by human life.  We must have been put here to learn very valuable lessons from our surroundings.  Why else would our planet be so diverse?  There are so many differences in every region; from the people and their beliefs, to the land and the culture, this planet is all about change and I get the distinct idea that it is trying to teach us everything it can.  Well, that is all for now.  Gotta get going to lunch.

"event","Today I had a revelation.  I don't mean just a thought that cleared something up or a mind clearing discussion with someone.  I mean I was sitting on my couch no doing anything (my book supply is at the Duluth library and I REALLY need to get a card from my hometown library to last me through vacation) and I started thinking as I often do.  I started thinking about the eternal question, ""what is the meaning of life?""  I think I have found it (at least in my eyes).  The meaning of my life is so simple it has been staring me in the face and screaming out to me for years, but I was looking too hard for it.  Finally I stopped looking, and I think it found me.  I am here for three reasons.  1) To figure out as much from this world as I can during my lifetime and learn from the information I am able to gather.  2) Have an impact in other peoples lives and help them figure out this world.  3) To act on what I have learned from everything in this world and try as hard as humanly possible to make it easier for future generations to figure out this world.  All of this before I inevitably die.
To you, that last sentence may have sounded as though I am depressed.  To many, talking about death seems like a downer.  But, one thing I have learned and fully grasped is that everything in this world ends.  This does not disappoint me, nor does it make me feel as though life is pointless.  For there is a purpose to my life.  I know it.  I figured it out today.
So why then do I do things that are seemingly pointless?  Why do I have lightsaber fights in public parking lots and malls?  Why do I sit back and watch cartoons a couple times a month?  Why do I climb my favorite tree in my parent's backyard, the one that I have been climbing since I was twelve, and sit there for hours just enjoying being alive and seemingly accomplishing nothing (hence the name, backyard philosopher)?  Because it is all part of living.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING that exists in this world has a purpose and everything that happens is a lesson to teach us.  I soak up the world by living my life day by day and learning from everything that happens.
As always, I am open to constructive criticism of my ideas and would love to hear any constructive thoughts or comments.  Thank you dearly for your time.

living and learning,

"event","So... this is a journal and I'm pretty sure that I'm suppose to write in it, but at the moment I have no idea what to write.  I guess I could start off by telling everyone why I started live journal.  I started it because I need something/someone to talk to that isn't going to judge me and if they do who cares because they are online and not in my face.  I HATE intolerance and rude remarks, and since people in these communities usually only read and comment on stuff they are interested in, I will probably recieve at the worst, positive criticism.  Oh well, I am going to get going.  Not so big for a first journal entry, but I am sure I will post again soon.  Besides, I need some time to work on my book before I go to bed.

Forever thinking,

"event","My baby girl made the A/B honor roll...No big deal you say?  Say!!  The first 4 1/2 weeks of this grading period, she had a big fat, oh gosh, I don't even want to type it...F.  Mixed fractions were her down fall.  Luckily for her the last of the grading period was on geometry, which she excelled in.  Bottom line, she had a B on her report card.  I guess I had promised $50 as a reward if she brought home a B, so ok.  Then she tells me that she made the honor roll, and well, I told her that I would reward her with $100, as soon as I got my tax money.  She has worked her butt off, and I am extremely proud.  Oh, the mid term science grade was a D, so this really is a big deal!! Tomorrow is their award program, and she will be recognized for the honor roll, plus her homeroom teacher told her that she would either be the Terrific Kid or the Champion Student for the past 9 weeks.  So, you see, she does deserve the $100.

She's with her Daddy now, he picked her up from the after school provider since I had my Dr. appointment.  Her fed her supper and is supposed to have her home in a few minutes.  I'm anxious to see her.

So, I wonder if the newly engaged person will attend the program tomorrow with Kenny?  My money says, yes.  But, I will be good, after all this is about Taylor, not me...  Oh gosh, I wish I had already lost my weight...
Yeah, I know, what do I care, I don't want him.  Good luck missy...

The stirrup doctor went well.  Oh, got some more good news about turning five O.  Next year I will have the pleasure of getting a colonoscopy!!  Woo hoo.  sop, according to her; every 5-10.  And the hits just keep on coming.  She did kinda compliment me, if that's the correct choice of words.  She told me that my breasts were dense, heck I never knew they were supposed to be smart.  I know, bad joke.  Anyway, she said it was a good thing, because they wouldn't sag so much later on.  Whack, sag and later on.  I don't want to get O L D.

It's already 27 outside and I am hearing from a SNOW friend, that we are supposed to get some of that white stuff this Thursday.  Bah humbug; I've seen my share of snow.  I really wish that Amy & Dawn could go spend a winter in Indiana.  The normal winter, not the unseasonably warm stuff they've had the past few years.  I mean a REAL winter.  I guarantee you, they would feel the same way about it, as I do.  The last winter I spent in Indiana (1981), we had wind chill factors at -70.  Yes, that is a minus sign.  I was going out and starting my car almost every hour and then covering the engine with an old bed spread to keep it warm.  Was told to do that to keep the engine going.  That was miserable.  Amy would have died in that cold.  It was brutal.  A little snow around here makes almost everyone happy, I guess it'll be ok.  Shhh, don't tell anybody that I said that."

"event","My first journal post
  
 Greetings and Salutations! I am a virgin journal writer, so you'll have to excuse me, I promise to get better with practice. Ha, sound familiar?

My friend Amy gave me the skinny about ""live journal"" on our way back from Florence SC tonight, so I figured I give it a whirl. Once I get good at this, then I'll get fired up for some of that Pay per post stuff; something else that I have to learn more about. All I know is she was talking about dough, and I don't mean the bakery kind, so look out you posties, there's a new kid coming to town. I'll see you in about 30 days, give or take.

Florence SC, yes, that's where we went to do a little shopping and eat tonight. We didn't get to leave too early, because Amy works part time at the Hospital Pharmacy, so we waited until 5. We chose Florence over Fayetteville, N.C., because we (well mainly me) thought it would be as congested. With Fort Bragg expanding, Fayetteville has been a traffic nightmare. Well, were we (oops, I mean me) WRONG. My goodness, it looked like 5 pm on Christmas Eve, traffice everywhere. Eating!! What a joke!! At 8:15, there was an 1 1/2 wait at Olive Garden (YUMO), over an hour at Long Horn, after those two we went to Peurcy and Willies. We sat at the bar and each had a Midori sour...now that's yummy. Anyway, that wait was only to be 20 minutes, but the more we looked at that pricey menu and limited food options; well we sucked those drinks down and headed to Ruby Tuesday's. Bottom line, we ate there, wasn't the best...but we finally got to eat. Got home a little after 11, so here I am. Well, it's been great sharing this experience with you, but I must get some sleep. Hope you enjoyed my ramblings....Oh, by the way...Did you see I.U. kick some Michigan butt in basketball today....woo hoo.

"event","It was 12 degrees with the wind chill factor this morning; actual temp was 22.  Some people will say that this isn't cold.  HELLO, we are in the sunny south, it ain't supposed to get this cold.  Now mind you, I suffer from hot flashes, and I am normally burning up...I was freezing this morning!!  Oh well, it'll be back up in the fifties tomorrow.  Fifties, that number is haunting me.  It's getting closer and closer every day.  I'll take it compared to the alternative!!

Let's see, anything on the soon to be Ex and his fiancee.  OMG.  Still makes my blood boil (guess I should have thought about that this morning when I was cold).  Like I've said, I don't care that he's engaged and that they are living together, good that they can be happy.  However, finish all your other obligations, before you move on.  That's something that has always angered me about him.  He rarely completes anything or follows through.  Oh, I did find out the name of his two new puppies.  Yes, I said 2 puppies, at one time.  His logic, they can take care of each other...he's already being lazy about the puppies!!  I do agree that having 2 dogs at one time is a good idea, but not puppies.  That's a little far fetched.  maybe I'd better go do a puppy rescue.  After all, we all know how the story of Romeo & Juliet ends.

I have a wonderful doctor appointment this afternoon, I can hardly wait.  Gotta love those stirrups."

"event","Well, it appears that I don't know how to do this...

I can't seem to find what I spent nearly 20 minutes on last night; and Amy said this was easy.  But I shall continue on.  It's Sunday morning and I am wide awake @ 8am.  It's cold, 45 degrees, and raining, YUCK, so why am I up?

Probably because my daughter came home with some wonderful information last night...her daddy is engaged.  Yep, and the funny thing is--we aren't even divorced.  But you have to know him to understand.  I can't even begin to talk about it today, because I am so p.o.'d.  Not because he's getting married, I HONESTLY, don't care, as long as she's good to my daughter.  I'm angry cause he bought her a ring..my daughter found the paperwork, and he confirmed it this morning.  What I'm upset about is the fact that he owes me $$ and goes out and buys an engagement ring.  Two weeks ago, he went out and spent over $600 on Xbox Live and games.  Come on!!  Makes me want to scream.  He'll get his divorce all right, but forget about the promissory note...I'll get ALL the money, or I ain't signing.  Enough is Enough!!"

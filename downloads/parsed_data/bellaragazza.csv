"event","I'm posting again.  Why?  Because I have work to do, and I don't want to do it.  So I procrastinate by writing in this thing.

Not much has happened in the past few days.  I went to New York City on Saturday with a group from school.  I spent the whole day with Katherine, and we had an awesome time!  We walked around Times Square for a little while before heading to the New York Public Library (Kath wanted a picture with the lion statues).  We went inside to escape the nasty weather and ended up looking at an exhibit entitled, ""Before Victoria.""  It was all about the women during the Victorian era and their troubles with gambling, politics, adultery, etc.  It wasn't that interesting.  Luckily, a phone call from Kath's friend Kathryne (I sure hope I spelled that right) interrupted our nerdology.

After a number of ""Where are you?"" phone calls, we met up with Kathryne and headed to Europa Cafe for some lunch.  We all feasted on some delicious panini sandwiches while Kathryne entertained us with her stories of life in the city and her brushes with famous people.  Who knew Billy Crystal's wife was such a wench?!  When we finished, Kathryne insisted we try ""New York's #1 Frozen Dessert,"" Tasti D-Lite.  I had some cappucino Tasti D-Lite with chocolate chips.  Kath and Kathryne shared some fruity stuff (also with chocolate chips).  Then Kathryne walked with us to the Richard Rodgers Theater, where Kath and I saw the show ""Movin' Up.""

What a weird show!  The people on stage don't act or sing.  They just dance.  There is a band suspended over the stage, and the piano player sings many of Billy Joel's hits while a story unfolds on stage.  It was different, and not altogether bad, though I do think there are other shows I like better.

After the show, Kath and I meandered uptown, stopping at various stops along the way.  We strolled up Fifth Avenue, but didn't buy anything, because, frankly, we are both broke as a joke.  We ended at Patsy's Pizzeria, where we had a delicious dinner and enjoyed some Merlot.  Felt very grown-up, maybe because it was the first time I had ever NOT been carded when purchasing alcohol.

On the way back downtown, we hit up Dylan's Candy Store.  It is a pretty large candy store, founded by the daughter of designer Ralph Lauren.  They have a lot of candy there, including hard to find items and specialty items.  We took the subway part of the way back, then walked to our stop.  We were a bit early, so we got coffee/soda at Dean and DeLuca and sat outside for awhile, waiting for the bus.  Overall, it was a good time!

Yesterday was the KDP (Kappa Delta Pi) induction ceremony.  It was not all that interesting, but you do what you have to do, I guess.  Later I sang at Mass, but had to leave early to be on duty.  Sorry to all those who were stuck there for about an hour and a half!

Yeah, that's about all I've got."

"event","Yes, folks, it's that time again.  The once every 18 months or so that I actually update my journal.  Some may ask, ""Lauren, why don't you update your journal more?""  The answer to that is very simple...I have nothing to say.

But now I do.  So I'm updating my journal, at the urging of Katherine.  The big news at the moment is that I am going to be working in California for the summer!  I am so excited!  And a little nervous.  But mostly excited!  I'll be working as an RA for 5th and 6th graders as part of a program for gifted and talented students.  I know some people are upset that I will not be in Syracuse for the summer, but this is my time to escape!  I'll be sure to take pictures and let you all know how I'm doing out on the West Coast.

Beside that, things are pretty boring right now.  This semester is going okay, but there seems to be a ton of work left to do and no time to do it in.  I have all these trivial assignments to do, and there are other things I would rather focus my attention on, like my Honors thesis and getting ready for student teaching in the fall.

I might be going to NYC this weekend, so that is exciting.  And I'm definitely going with my mom and Greg in June, so that's awesome, too!

I really don't have much else to say, so I'll end here.  Have a great day!  Oh, and if you're one of those people who's reading this and you haven't talked to me in months or even years, please send me a message so I know you are still alive.  Thanks!"

"event","Yup, that's what I'm doing.  Hanging on.  By a thread, basically.  I'm so sick of writing papers.  There are other things I could be doing that would be more productive and more fun at the same time.  Like what?  Well, doing some volunteer work at a school would be a good idea.  I could work with children (and thereby get some job experience) and have a good time (because I love little kids!).  But instead, I'm stuck here in my room writing about marriage in the time of Shakespeare.  Do you think I care about marriage in the time of Shakespeare?  ABSOLUTELY not!  And guess what I get to do when I am done with this paper?  I get to start on the next one, which is about the extremely enthralling topic of Charles V and how he focused too much on things outside the Holy Roman Empire and therefore finalized the split between Protestants and Catholics in Germany.  Isn't that great?  Don't you wish you could write that paper?  Well, guess what?  You can!  E-mail me and it's yours.  I HATE PAPERS!!!!!!!!!!!"

5. What would you say is the most daring thing to do in a lifetime?  Going for it.  All the time.

14.Do you ever sing to yourself while doing everyday tasks?  Only if I am home alone or I am feeling really goofy.

38.Speaking of pizza, what's your favorite kind? (toppings and/or place to get it from) 
Hmm...I like DiGiorno Supreme pizza.  Otherwise, I like Hawaiian pizza or plain cheese.  The crust is my favorite part, so it has to be from someplace with good crust (aka not Domino's).

"event","...and I don't want it to!  My first year here at Le Moyne College is almost complete, and honestly, I am not looking forward to going home.  This year has been the best year of my life!  My classes have been awesome, living away from home is cool, and most importantly, I have made some of the best friends in the world!  How can I leave all that?
	It will be so weird over the summer.  I will not have to do my own laundry.  My friends will not be down the hall or across campus.  They will be scattered across New York State, and in some cases, the country.  There will be only one choice of food for dinner, like it or not.  (Don't get me wrong, I won't miss the caf food!)  I cannot leave my house at 11:00 at night to go to Friendly's.  I can't stay up until 3 in the morning playing cards.  There will be no inside jokes, no burns, not even any tiny violins. 
	I can't really sum up in words how sad and disappointed I will be to leave on Tuesday.  I will miss all my friends here tremendously.  I really hope to write you all frequently so we don't lose touch, but I don't think it will be the same.  I also want to come visit all of you!
	2003-2004 will be a rockin' year!  I'll be in 410 St. Mary's as of August 15th, so please visit often.  101 Harrison and 101 Townhouses will be my hangouts.  I hope you all have a great summer.  Don't forget about me.  Prepare yourself for even more fun next year!  I love you all!!!!!!!!!!!!"

You doin' that thing you do
Breakin' my heart into a million pieces
Like you always do
And you don't mean to be cruel
You never even knew about the heartache
I've been going through
And I try and try to forget you girl
But it's just so hard to do
Every time you do that thing do

I know all the games you play
And I'm gonna find a way to let you know that
You'll be mine someday
'Cause we could be happy can't you see
If you'd only let me be the one to hold you
And keep you here with me
'Cause I try and try to forget you girl
But it's just so hard to do
Every time you do that thing do

I don't ask a lot (I don't ask a lot)
But I know one thing for sure (Know one thing for sure)
It's the love that I haven't got girl
And I just can't take it anymore

'Cause we could be happy can't you see
If you know me, let me be the one to hold you
And keep you here with me

'Cause it hurts me so just to see you go
Around with someone new
And if I know you you're doing that thing
Every day just doing that thing
I can't take you doing that thing you do

Isn't that so sweet?  I wish someone felt that way about me!  I'd be his in a second."

"event","Well, no Dolphy Day again today, which is somewhat disappointing.  I didn't even hear the scares this morning, even though they were reportedly very loud.  It's kind of cold out, though, so it's probably a good thing.  
	As usual, the reason I am writing in my journal is because I am avoiding my work.  I have to read Thomas Aquinas for Honors and I just don't want to do it right now.
	Hmm...there's not too much interesting to say.  Nothing's really been going on.  I have been spending a lot of time in 303.  That's been fun!  Chinese food was good last night, too.
	I got my floor assignment today.  I'm going to be on the fourth floor, exactly where I didn't want to be, but I'll make the best of it.  My room next year is one room over from the room I'm living in now.  All Le Moynians take note:  I will be in 410 St. Mary's.  Please come visit often!  
	Only 19 days until summer vacation.  I'm not super excited because I've made such good friends here and very few of them live close by.  Plus, I have to work a lot.  And, I am getting my wisdom teeth out and an implant in to replace the tooth I am missing.  That will probably be both painful and scary.  However, I am looking forward to spending time with my family and swimming a lot at my Grandma's.  I hope it's not as hot this summer.
	I enjoy writing in this journal, but it's a little weird knowing that basically anyone could read this at any time.  
	Well, that's all I really have to ramble about right now, so I'm off to do work."

"event","In a word...nothing.  I've been doing homework and I worked last night.  Last night I worked with Hitler.  It wasn't too bad, but she tried to be nice and it just didn't work out.  When she first got there (an hour later than she was scheduled), she spotted these ""fanny packs"" on the counter.  You know, they're those things that go around your waist and you can put stuff in them.  Well, she put one on me and said I had to model it so that we would sell some.  I wanted to kill her.  But anyway, the night went on rather smoothly.  When it was getting close to closing time this lady came in who is notorious for always making us stay open late.  This time was no exception.  We didn't get out of there until ten.  I drove home and my mom's friends were over.  They got in a big, loud fight about whether or not parents should ""waste the money"" for their daughters to go to college.  Oh well.  Today the main thing I did was go to lunch with my mom, grandma, aunt, and cousin becuase my cousin leaves for college tomorrow and we are good friends, so I wanted to say goodbye to her.  It was pretty fun.  I came home and did some homework.  I watched my favorite TV show, Guiding Light.  Later I watched my second favorite TV show, Big Brother 2.  Now I'm sitting here typing this journal entry.  I wish I had somewhere to go or something.  In fact, I'm dying to go to a movie or miniature golfing.  But Justin and Ted are so wrapped up with each other that neither one wants to spend any time with me.  Robyn is sick.  And Bill is off having a great time in the gay/lesbian summer capitol of the world.  Hehe! :)  I miss you lots!  Well, I guess that's all I have to say for right now.  Bye!"

Anyway, yesterday my mom and I spent the day together.  Most of the time we were outside.  It was really hot and sunny and I got sunburned on my arms and chest.  I probably have the funkiest tan lines on record.  Anyway, that was fun.  Since my mom and I were both tired, my dad and my brother were in charge of dinner.  They got KFC.  I got sick.  Then I did some homework.  I'm reading this book that's kinda cool for English.  I went online but there really wasn't anyone on except Danielle.  We compared schedules for next year but then I had to go because of the storm I mentioned earlier.  Tonight I have to work with Burger King lady.  That should be fun.  I guess that's all for now.  I'll probably write again tonight.  Bye!"

Oh well...my mom brought me some cafe mocha from Nancy's that was really good.  I went to Media Play to look for a book for my English homework but they didn't have it.  When I left work, I went to church with my parents.  It was boring.  We went to Wegman's to get dinner.  I got some Chinese, which was good, but it made me feel sick.  Then I turned on some music and just hung out in my room for a while.  Music always puts me in a good mood.  Then I came online and started typing this journal entry.  And that was my day.  I found out today that on Monday I have to work with the meanest person who works at Hammett's.  That's right - Monday night I work with Burger King lady.  Oh well. I'll deal with it.

Anyway, then I did all my stuff like take a shower and that junk.  Then I watched Price is Right and my tape of yesterday's Guiding Light.  I love Guiding Light!!!   Then I went to work.  When I got there, Anne, Carolyn, and Bill were working.  Since I really wasn't needed, I kinda felt left out.  Which of course my most favoritest co-worker noticed.  He made me feel better.  :)  But then he and Anne had to leave and I was left with Carolyn.  It wasn't too bad but we were really busy for a long time.  Right in the middle of the evening the phone rang.  Of course I answered like I always do, but the person on the other end wasn't talking to me.  He was talking to someone else and I couldn't tell what he was saying.  So I hung up.  It was a little strange.  But then the same exact thing happened to Carolyn.  So it became a lot strange.  Then it happened again!!!!  This time I turned the volume up really loud so I could hear what the person was saying.  All I heard was, ""I've seen this one already.""  It was strange.  Well, anyway I came home, had dinner, watched today's Guiding Light and now I'm online.  To Bill:  Guess what?  Today might be the last time we see each other for two whole weeks.  Now I'm sure that makes you quite happy, but it makes me a little sad.  Work will be un-fun without you.  I'll miss you lots.  Bye!"

But then we got home and my mom and dad started fighting and I just wanted to scream and punch and kick something (because I was already in a bad mood and that made it worse).  So anyway, I went to work.  There was lots of stuff to do and it was pretty busy.  Got to work with one of my favorite co-workers which was good, because he put me in a good mood.  Then I got home and was in a bad mood again until I listened to some music and read my new issue of CosmoGirl!, which was very good.

Went to my cousin Alex's 4th birthday party and got into a whipped cream fight.  It was pretty funny actually.  See, I was sitting out by the pool and one of my cousins threw a big bucket of water at me.  So his mom found out and made him apologize and said that I could do one thing to get back at him.  Whatever I wanted!  The only thing I could think of was putting a pie in his face.  Well, there was no pie, but one of my aunts (the one hosting the party) gave me all the whipped cream from the edges of the birthday cake.  I took it outside, but unfortunately my cousin was quicker than I was.  We went back and forth for a minute, but then he hit it out of my hand and it splattered all over the place.  Mainly on my brother.  It was hysterical.  Anyway, then we all started wiping it all over every one else.  I got a huge thing of it on my shorts.  It was so funny.  Greg got mad though.  Oh well.  Then I came home and sat down at my computer and basically did nothing because there was no one online.  And now I'm typing a new journal entry.  I think that's all I have to say right now.  Bye!"

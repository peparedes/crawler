"event","so every tuesday night for the past month or so, i've been going to trivia night down at clever dunne's tavern a few blocks away from my house. they give away prizes every week, it's free to play, and the trivia is actually pretty damn challenging most of the time. there's cash prizes for the top 3 teams (20, 30 and 40 bones), random raffle prizes (this week it was stuff the host's wife had given him for valentine's day), and a pitcher of beer for the best team name, new names every week. in the few weeks i've played, we've never gotten above 5th or 6th place among maybe 12 teams, and have always been trumped in the name game.

<lj-cut text=""more on the game"">

the way it's set up there are 6 categories:
 <ul>
<li>general knowledge (easy) round - it's actually moderately difficult
<li>wildcard category  - this week it was seinfeld trivia, but in the past we've had comics and cartoons, and the flintstones. dorks only.
<li>a matching round where you match up related items, i.e. match the sci-fi author to his/her books, match the lesson to the fairy tale, etc.
<li>the ""identify a celebrity from their poorly photocopied picture"" round - harder than it sounds, even if you're into pop culture. we once thought alicia keys was scary spice.
<li>the music round (double point round)- identify song and artist from 30 second sample of music with a point for each. waaaaaaaay harder than it sounds, with some giveaways thrown in for good measure.
<li>and the general knowledge (hard) round (double point round) - you're lucky if you get one or two right in this one.
</ul>
</lj-cut>

anyways, this week was our week. ""my unicorn shits (gumdrops)"" won first place. it was pretty rad. we got 40 bucks to split between 4 of us and congratulation from our formidable opponents. it a was a close game too, we were really surprised to win. we won with 47 points, second place had 46 points, third 45 points and 3 teams tied for 4th with 44 points. i believe we would have had our normal slightly above average score had we not had a certified seinfeld expert amongst us. we totally nailed every question in that category, tho if it had only been me responsible for the answers, we would have scored exactly 0.

so now i am home, 10 extra bucks in my pocket, and 2 pints split 4 ways in my belly. it's a feeling i will cherish until two weeks from now when ""the chapped anus brigade"" comes in our normal 5th or 6th place again."

"event","last night my grandpa died. he was 92 years old. he'd just had some surgery to to remove cancer from his intestines and seemed to be recovering well, but then he died in his sleep last night. i don't really know how to feel about all this. i've never had a relative that i actually knew die. he was the patriarch of my large extended family. i wonder what's going to happen now. i'm not sure if i'll be able to make it to the memorial or not. it depends on my work situation i guess. my dad called me this morning to tell me and i could hear him choking back tears. my father is a saint and one of the finest people i know, and it's painful to hear him upset. i wish there was something i could do, but i know we all die, and my grandpa lived a very full life. my grandma can't take care of herself anymore, and i'm not sure what she's going to do either. a couple of my uncles have been taking care of her since grandpa went in for surgery last week. i can't imagine that she's too far behind. i want to comfort my father, he has always been so understanding and comforting to me. he always recognizes the relativity of life and gives instead of taking. i want to be like that. i hope my grandpa is in a good place and is free of pain. rest in peace grandpa."

"event","ok, so i got sick over xmas break, and what began as a sinus cold has now turned into full-blown laryngitis. i totally can't talk. when i try, all that comes out is either high pitched squeaks or low low register bass. i guess i can be that doo-wop singer who sings that low ""yeeeah"" part now. 

it's weird, i haven't lost my voice for years and years, and i've only ever lost it a couple times. i thought it would be kinda cool but actually, it completely sucks. i don't ""feel"" sick at all, just a sore throat, but i'm not supposed to talk or whisper or smoke or anything, and it's gonna be another 5-10 days before my vocal chords recover. we'll see how it all turns out. in the meantime i am watching movies, playing britney spears dance beat, and drinking lots of hot tea. care for a laugh? call me up."

"event","the more i go thru my life, the more it becomes overwhelmed by art projects. i don't care what the project is, i'll dive in head first and fast. i've always claimed to be an art fag, but i think i've reached a point where it's borderline unhealthy. i mean, i have boxes and boxes of supplies for projects that i haven't touched in far too long. the reason? another project comes by that takes my interest even more. in one years time i've gone from recording to circuitbending to crochet to painting to duct tape. i've got a MOUNTAIN of yarn in my bedroom....no lie! i spent over 1000 bucks on yarn last year alone! i'm beginning to wonder what's next, and why i keep doing this. (answers: sewing and stoned lonliness) 

i don't have enough room in my house for my projects. maybe i should just rent a studio and i would feel less overwhelmed by it. i'm literally surrounded by supplies -- and everything is within arms reach. i guess that makes me the ultimate lazy guy, i don't want to have to walk 3 feet to get to my soldering iron or camoflauge yarn or yellow duct tape. at least i'm doing something i suppose. some people sit on their asses and eat potato chips. me? i've gotta put em in a casserole that will be growing fuzz by monday."

"event","ok...so not only was yesterday the motherfucking day to end all days, but i had not one, but *TWO* gnarly dreams last night:

dream one:

eminem is my boyfriend, only i come to find that it is not eminem, but his son, who looks exactly like him and is the same age. he tells me that he's gay and that he loves me. as we're making out in my parents shower, my mom comes home (she's showing the house to a perspective buyer -- oddly enough, in reality, my parents have never lived in the house in this dream, and they're not selling their house as is). my mom walks in the bathroom and discovers eminem and i fully making out and naked in the shower. she gets mad.

dream two:

i am at disneyland with my family, but the rides are all different and i don't want to ride them. they have internet connections all around the park, so i bust out my laptop (which i don't in actuality own) while waiting for the rest of my group to finish the rides. somehow, i've unintentionally busted into the ride controls of the park and every button i push makes the rides go haywire and several people are killed.

there was actually a dream three as well. the first two were so good i decided to sleep in longer. however, i don't remember what the third dream was, but i do remember that it was equally as fun/disturbing. i can only dream (hahaha) that i could have those kinds of dreams every night. who wouldn't want to fuck eminem in the shower and kill lots of disneyland patrons in the same night?"

"event","so since the last time i added to this journal, almost nothing has happened to me. it's been pretty standard/slow going. i watched a couple movies and hung out with wes a bunch. pretty normal. until today. warning: this will be long.

<b>before work</b>
this morning i woke up to a knock on my door. it was the gas and electric guy telling me that they were shutting off the gas and then turning it back on and he'd have to relight my pilot light. i said ok and went back to bed. 15 mintues later he's back and lighting my pilot lights (i have four). he seemed embarassed to be waking me up. 

i felt depressed when i woke up, so i got online to talk to some of my old friends and gain a bit of esteem back. in response to my depression, my friend jon in florida offered to have me come live with him for 6 months in florida, and offered to pay for it. as enticing as that sounds, i decided against it (for the moment) as it screamed ""houseboy"", which i have no interest in being. 

once off the internet, i decided to call brian, who dumped me 5 months ago and stopped talking to me entirely not long after that. he never answers his phone anymore and so i left him a message. it is pretty safe to assume he will never call me back. 

<b>work</b>
so then i left for work, once i arrived i realized that it was ""new release day"" as we call it...and it was a big one. two carts worth of big. the owner of the store i work at is sooooooooo out of touch. he ordered 3 times as much ""t.rex and marc bolan's greatest hits"" as he did the new sleater-kinney album (which i'm sure we'll sell out of within 48 hours). he still thinks thin lizzy is hot shit, and if we sell more than 5 of that marc bolan thing i'll be fucking floored. as the evening progressed, my lead co-worker erin (who is a guy) grew increasingly agitated and we bitched about the owner for a good hour. erin's frusteration soon took on physical form as he began to step on and destroy promo cd's and videos for our amusement. he later made a sculpture of the destroyed merchandise which he promptly threw in the trash. after i gave the final closing announcement (""your ____ _______ shopping experience will destruct in 5 mintues, please make your final selections."") and the last customers left, we began the HUGE fucking task of putting out all the new releases. we had already bought beer (a requiered ritual for monday nights at work) and were about halfway through with our first each. i was bringing the new sleater-kinney vinyl to the stacks and suddenly heard a gushing noise, not unlike a gigantic toilet flushing. i looked for where it was coming from and saw what looked like what i imagined would happen if you flushed a gigantic toilet. water, complete with little brown chunks, was shooting 8 inches into the air, flooding rock/pop C-G with a good 2 inches of water. we called the general manager at home and woke him up to let him know the good news. after a brief freak out, we got our shit together, let the water flow, and continued to drink and put out the releases. the water eventually stopped shooting out of the ground and we came to the conclusion that it was rain water from the roof (the brown chunks revealing themselves as bits of moss). god, there sure was a lot of it though. but i had to get out of there...my last bus was leaving in 5 mintues, so i bailed. (sorry morning crew...hehehe)

<b>after work</b>
so i get to the bus stop and call wesley from the payphone, on the verge of tears from my amazing, crazy day and he tells me he's doing laundry and to come over. i go to wait for the bus and sit on the bench. all of a sudden a fat, retarded/crazy (i couldn't tell which, perhaps both?) lady tells me that a guy asked her for a dollar and she hates it when people ask her for money. normally when retarded/crazy people talk to me at bus stops i bust out the headphones, but i decided to engage her in some playful conversation. over the course of our 20 minute chat on the bus we covered a few subjects: self defense (she made a would-be purse snatcher eat concrete then sat on him, and can take out 16 people at once, but wouldn't tell me how she does it. i told her it was best to kick guys in the nuts and she didn't beleive me.); portland (she loves it there but it's tough -- two girls tried to break into her apartment and she scared them away ""the way you get 'em is the element of suprise!""); the fact that people won't talk to her cuz they think she's crazy/retarded (she said she was neither but i don't buy it.). she scratched her boobs a lot. i bet they're hairy.

so i got to wesley's where i was welcomed by a much needed hug. i had another beer, hung out for a couple hours and came home. here i am, with another beer in hand. motherfuck!"

"event","tonight is friday night. i was working. we were not in the mood to work and were in the mood to party a bit so while at work, we bought a six pack of red stripe and poured it into cups so we could drink and the customers wouldn't know we were drinking. i had two beers and was feeling buzzed by the time we closed. we then went to a bar where we had a few more drinks, and now i'm home where i'm having another....weeeeeeeeehew! party! ironically, there were a couple guys who came into the store that were so drunk we almost kicked them out...they were yelling...approaching other customers rudely and just being generally loud and obnoxious. we know how to hold our liquor. 

in other drunk customer news. a couple days ago a 60something drunk guy came into the store and asked me to help him find an eagles DVD. i looked and we didn't have any, so he told me to pick something for him to buy. ""that's dangerous"", i said, knowing that my tastes were far from the eagles. i ended up having him buy a dave matthews DVD cuz i figured it was the closest thing we had to the eagles. little did i know that he had gone up to one of the other employees, pointed to me and said ""that one's dangerous"". he later, very aggressively tried to get me to go home with him. he said, ""i live a block away, you should come over an have a look at my system, i'm an audiophile."" it was pretty obvious to me that he just wanted to suck me off. he gave me a ""tip"" (86 cents), and kept insisting that i accompany him back to his house. i said ""actually, i'm working right now."" he told me, ""oh, i know...come over after you're done working."" i said ""i'm not interested."" if he would have been my imaginary boyfriend i would have."

"event","the other night i was walking home from wesley's house and along the way a dog started following me. it looked smart, lost, and friendly. it was like lassie, but about half the size. it followed right next to me for several blocks, including turning a corner.  this dog was obviously looking for someone to help it, and my attention specifically. it would walk along with me, not too near, somewhat aloofly at first, eventually actually stepping in front of me when i waited for stoplights. there were other people on the street, but i could tell they all assumed the dog was mine because of the way it was walking with me. i like dogs, and a big part of me felt like i should take this dog home and find it's owner. it was nearly walking into traffic at points and might have easily been hit by a car. however, i'm allergic to dogs, cats and any other furry creature except humans, my building doesn't allow pets, and if i couldn't find this dog's owner, there's no way i would be able to do anything but put it back on the street. i mean, i can hardly afford to feed myself these days. i ignored this dog while my heart ached for it until it eventually crossed the street. i couldn't look back. am i a bad person?"

"event","just got back from around the corner where i met up with some co-workers and a few others for too much beer and a birthday celebration. needless to say, at this point i'm drunk. i'm suprised i can even type coherent statements. perhaps i'm not and i just think i am. i know i shouldn't but i'll probably smoke some pot here in a minute. 

i feel like i'm finally beginning to belong to seattle. or more like i belong here. ever since i moved here i've felt like a bit of an outsider living in and looking at a city that was not a part of me. now i feel more like i'm interacting and participating in the city i live in. it's almost like a weight lifted off my shoulders in a way. i'm finding good friends here and if/when i move from seattle, i will feel like i've left a bit of myself here. 

on another front...

there is a guy who lives across from me, not in the same building, but in the building facing me, a halfway house, that pukes for about 14 hours a day. i first heard the puking about 4 months ago, but it wasn't a regular thing. now it's every day. it usually happens between 4am and 6pm. i don't just mean regular puking either. this is fucking intense shit! puking and puking and puking. at first i thought it was some junkie coming off junk or something. i've witnessed drug deals, sex, and all sorts of other random shady shit happening in this building. the puking is really disturbing/annoying. i've contemplated yelling things at what i call ""the puking man"" but i've never gotten the guts to do it. so i decided to record some of the puking man's noises to share with the world. my original intention was to record the puking man, then to record myself yelling stuff at the puking man, and then to put it up on the internet here for you fine people to hear. a couple days ago a friend of mine came over and heard the puking man doing his thing and suggested that he might be really sick. like cancer or aids or something like that. this kind of changed how i feel about the whole situation. it hadn't occured to me that this might be some man with terminal cancer or something undergoing chemotherapy or some other awful thing. once i realized that this guy was probably in serious pain i decided to not yell stuff at him, but by this time i had already recorded his noisy puking and i am going to put it up here for you fine folks to hear. <a href=""http://www.shortround.com/pukingman.mp3"">click here to download the puking man in action</a>. as much as this man pukes soooooo fucking loud, i have decided that i shouldn't make his life more miserable than it probably already is, as that would surely secure my place in hell if it's not already reserved.  i have decided to wear earplugs at night, which has not only silenced the puking man as i try to sleep but has given me a bizarre new sense of my own body. i can hear my heart beating and the blood pulsing through my veins. i hear my bones crack and my breathing. it's comforting."

"event","just got back from hanging out with wes. i'm beginning to lose track of the amount of times i've gone over to his house right after work and come home past 2am. god blessim for staying up late with me. i suppose the late hours comes with working the night shift. by that time i should probably just stay there. of course it doesn't help that he has to get up early usually and that i sleep in til 2 in the afternoon. eh...what can you do? walk home.

i'm glad i have a friend like wes though. after being perpetually shit on for so long it's nice to be around someone who you beleive really wants to be around you as much as you want to be around them. however, i know he reads this, so i'm going to stop talking about him before he accuses me of embarassing him in public. 

on another matter...

you may have noticed that a few of my entries here have revolved around my observations of people on the bus and other bus related stories. it's weird, i rode the bus in san francisco all the time and here in seattle, bus people are more ""active"". they do weird things, publically, and i'm thinking of becoming one of them. i know from observations that other passengers and the drivers rarely react to anything. developing some kind of weird tic, phrase, or character to become for those 15 or 20 minutes could be a really fun escape from the dreary existance we call my life. so here are some ideas i've had:

1. go up to people and talk to them in a gibberish grindcore voice. (this seems like it would be especially fun with tourists.

2. play air drums to my headphones really exuberantly, complete with sound effects. i could only do this one if the bus was empty enough that i could take over a full double seat, or ideally the whole back area. the fact that i don't play the drums would make this especially fun. 

3. whisper something non-sexual, but still disturbing to the person next to me, even though i'm wearing my headphones. something along the lines of: ""yeah, so maybe you are 'artistic'', but tommy, that doesn't give you the right to spray paint my croch."" or ""i'll always be your little bitch baby."" this one is probably best done right before you get off the bus to avoid any possible aftermath and/or response. 
4. go up to a random person and talk to them like i've known them for years. spend the duration of the trip trying to convince them that i know them from somewhere. 

5. make faces at someone across the bus the whole trip. 

if you can think of other things i might want to consider doing, let me know and i promise that if i use your suggestion and get arrested i'll tell the cops that you made me do it. it'll only add to the confusion and fun. 

ok...it's late...time for bed or another beer....hmmm..."

"event","today while i was waiting to pick up the 8 bus, a semi-gothic looking twentysomething guy started walking down the hill. he was wearing a thin black ankle length dress with a sleeveless t shirt and combat boots. this in and of itself was not remarkable. what was remarkable was the fact that this man was wearing no underwear and you could totally see his weiner flopping around under this dress. i mean like, full on outlines. flopping. as if this were not enough, once we got on the bus he sat across the aisle from me. two stops later, lo and behold, another gender bending man walked on the bus. this guy looked like a cross between john waters and homer simpson, wearing a tan miniskirt/kilt (couldn't tell which it was. whatever it was it was SHORT.), a wife beater, knee high socks pulled up to his knees, a gold hoop earring, and an offensive amount of sweat. he had that pencil thin john waters moustache, but he pursed his lips in this weird, angry way that made it look like he had just sucked on a lemon and had a bird poop on him. at first i thought it might be his mood, but after careful study, i came to the conclusion that his face was indeed stuck that way. this guy made the first guy look like a mormon missionary. he kept giving the up and down to every guy that walked past him and looked around at everyone with what i interpreted as some form of disgust. he had weird scabs on his arms and legs and i could tell by the muscles in his head that he was clenching his jaw over and over. the skirt/kilt/thing he was wearing was totally bunching up and all i could think was ""god, i hope he's wearing underwear, cuz if he's not, his ass and nuts are totally rubbing up on the seat."" i tried to look to see if he was or not, but couldn't get a good look, and once i realized what i was actually trying to see, i got grossed out and stopped thinking about it.

in other news, i got an advance copy of the new neko case album ""blacklisted"" today. when i got it, i very nearly had an accident in my pants, as it was a suprise."

"event","tonight, i am feeling kinda weird. a little sad and tired. i don't know why really. i guess it's just one of those feelings that come over me here and there. i feel like i should feel really ok and fine, but really, i feel like there's no point to my existance. perhaps there isn't. it reminds me of that song from jesus christ superstar where jesus sings ""first i was inspired, now i'm sad and tired."" that's kinda how i feel right now. 

in other news, i worked again tonight (actually just got home a little bit ago) and got a nice letter from my mom with pictures of my family, a friend's wedding that i missed, and a check. maybe that's why i feel kinda sad. i miss my family. i miss having a life and i miss my life 3 or 4 years ago. however, there's no point in missing any of that stuff because it's totally gone. i just feel really incomplete.

nothing important happened to me today."

"event","today i met up with wes at the video store and we started working on our list of movies to see. we ended up renting ""my science project"", ""space camp"", and ""adventures in babysitting"". this is not the first time wes and i have watched 3 or more movies in one sitting. other movies we've tackled have been: ""follow that bird"", ""bully"", ""9 to 5"", ""teen witch"", ""drop dead gorgeous"", ""eyes of tammy faye"" and countless others. 

after we rented the movies we went to the QFC to get some bread and bacon so we could make bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches, which we did. they were good. later that night i cut wes' hair and now it's all short and sexy. 

i wonder which movies we will rent next time. suggestions?"

"event","today, i sat and waited for the 8 to come and pick me up and take me to work. i think i got there right after one had left because in the 1/2 hour i waited there, two 43's went by. while i was waiting i sat down on a bench and picked up a copy of the stranger to pass the time. a funny looking man sat down next to me and asked me a few questions about the bus, i don't remember exactly what. 

a few minutes later i'm reading and i notice blood all over my hand. i recognize this blood. it's smeared across my hand in the same way i'd been rubbing my nose for the last few minutes. right when i noticed, i was wiping my nose and a huge dark bloody trail ran along my index finger. the man next to me looked over at me and asked me another question about the bus. i squeezed my finger into a fist to hide the blood best as i could. i couldn't tell if he noticed the blood or not, but i spent the next few minutes fidgeting, licking my fingers, and squeezing my nose, and trying really hard to make it not noticable. i think i got away with it, but now my jacket is a little bloody from where i wiped my nose on it."

"event","ok...so i just woke up a little bit ago and here's what i remember -- 
my little brother kept getting pregnant and i had to take care of his kids. i loved them like my own, but they would always leave me at some point, but there was always another one right behind the one that left. at some point i realized that my little brother was actually my own son. don't ask. i've never had a dream like that before."

"event","tonight i went to the girl bar and met up with some friends for drinks. i got some pot from one of the girls there and had a few beers while hot dykes and a fag or two got up and sang and got drunk all around me. dykes are so fun. it was really crowded though, and i can't say i was in much of a ""party"" mood. even though i know i'm welcome there, i always feel like i'm somehow intruding on women's space by being in a dyke bar. i should just accept the fact that i'm a big dyke myself and get over it. women are my future. if i've learned anything in the past 6 months it's this: boys are turds, even the good ones.

at least i managed to leave the house today. i woke up at 230pm and stayed in my boxers until around 6 when i knew wes was going to stop by. i would have been content with another day inside. it's weird how sometimes my house can really feel like a prison. it's certainly not as bad as it was at my old apartment in the tenderloin, but i still feel a need to stay indoors as much as possible. maybe i have a natural aversion to nature, sunlight, and all that is bright and good in the world. no...i can't be that cynical and dead inside. maybe i'm just agoraphobic. that's not so bad. 

i've been trying to remember my dreams in the morning by saying them out loud to myself when i wake up. if i can remember any of them i'll put them up here. maybe i'll take some melatonin tonight to make them extra fun. sounds like a plan."

"event","ok, so i'm working behind the counter at the store today when the drunkest couple i've ever seen came up asked me something i didn't understand. she had a grey mullet and he had a moustache and some kind of fishing/racing hat on and i could smell the cheap booze on them from across the counter. it turns out they were looking for pink floyd's ""the wall"", and i told them there were about 8 copies there and they complained that it was ""(something i couldn't understand) $32 (something else) bucks"". they ended up buying a used copy of some cheesy early 80's country music compilation for $7.99.

later that night i was asked if i was ""sleazin' it"" by a really fucked up guy on the bus. he spoke really loudly and obnoxiously the entire bus trip and kept asking the driver, an older gentleman whom he referred to as ""pops"", if he was ""all gene autry era"". the guy got off at broadway and john and before he departed, he let us all know that he would be ""sleazin' it on broadway"". i remember this same guy came up to the glass doors of the store about two weeks ago while we were closing and telling us we were ""sleazin' it"" and that our hairdressers were as well. we waited 10 minutes longer than we had to to leave because we were afraid of him. 

tonight my weekend begins and i'm sure i'll stay up until 6am like usual, get stoned, and fuck around and do nothing."

"event","hey everyone. this is my first livejournal entry. i'm a queer musician boy working at a fun record store job in seattle for less money than i'm making on unemployment. i have a few friends here, but as i've lived here less than a year and am shy, it's taken me a bit to come out of my shell. i've had my heart broken twice in my short time here in seattle and am feeling more than a bit of damage. it'd been nearly 4 years since i had dated before i moved up here, and now i feel drained and used. other than that i am fine.

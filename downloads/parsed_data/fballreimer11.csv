"event","AHHHH busy ass night at Medic 2.

I got to the station around 22:50.  My partner arrived shortly after.  We waited a few minutes for the 3-11 crew to arrive back from a call.  The 3-11 crew got back around 23:00 or so, and we relieved them.  Jeff V. and I sat around for maybe 10 mins and at 23:12 we received our first call of what would turn out to be the busiest shift of my short career.  It was an E-2 detail in Medic 8's area along with police at Jacks Tavern on the Southside for a bar fight that was in progress at the time the call came in; unknown injuries.  So we made our way down there to find several police cars parked on E. Carson street outside the bar.  It was a hectic sight inside the bar so we decided to wait outside until needed.  Apparently the fight involved two parties of two or more persons.  Having learned this, I called dispatch to ask for a second medic unit as I was pretty sure we would have more than one patient.  Medic 14 arrived shortly after my request.  The police made the necessary arrests and all in all, after things were sorted out, Medic 14 and ourselves ended up taking one E-3 patient to the Southside Hospital each.

Back in from Southside at 23:40.  As were leaving the hospital, Matt called my phone to state he was in a FIGHT which I was disappointed in because I was not there to help!  He seemed to have done ok for himself, as expected.  Ah well, sometimes a mans gotta do what he has to do.  Go Matt!

Back at the station by 23:55.  Restocked the truck with basic wound care things as we used alot of gause and shit on the last detail; the guy was cut up pretty good.  Anyway, we ended up only getting enough time to drink a coke when our second detail came in.  E-0 detail in Medic 5's area for a 16 year old femaile unconsious, not breathing; caller was refusing CPR! WHO REFUSES TO GIVE CPR! Later we would learn it was her MOTHER who called! Nice way to try and save your own daughter!!  Anyway, I digress.  My first reaction to the call was two things:  1) NOT breathing is no good at all, and 2) Medic 5's area is kind of far from our area.  Time would be critical, especially with the caller refusing to give CPR.  We arrived on scene in just under 10 minutes to find a 16 year old female DOA.  Now, I'm not going to blame the mother for the death, theres no way of knowng if CPR would have saved the daughter, but it sure wouldnt have hurt.  Whatever.  We called dispatch, told them it was a DOA.  Police arrived, said they'd wait for the coroner.  We called back in at around 00:22.

On the way back to our station we got another call.  E-0 detail in our area on Brookline Blvd. for a 60 year old male laying on the sidewalk in front of his house unconsious and shallow/no breathing, history of diabetes.  Pretty easy call.  We were on the Liberty Bridge when the call came in, so we went thru the Liberty Tunnels, hit Route 51 south and arrived in around 4 minutes on scene.  Again, easy call, as we had a pretty good idea that it was just a diabetic coma issue.  Upon arrival, we got him on some oxygen, took a look at his EKG, and started a line and administered D-50 (Dextrose), which is a sugar.  He came back to us within a minute.  We stayed on scene for maybe 7 minutes just to get him alert, get him to sit up, and monitor his EKG etc..  A quick transport over to Mercy as an E-3.  Again, like I said, easy call.  Arried at Mercy at 00:47...BS'd with the guys from Medic 7 and Medic 9 for a few...left Mercy and called back in around 01:07.

We decided it was time for some food so instead of heading back to the station from Mercy we headed over to the southside and stopped at the Primanti's at 10th and Carson St.  Got our sandwiches to go, headed up 18th St. up the mountain and got back to the station around 01:30 give or take a few minutes.  Revieved a call for a 2 car accident w/ entrapment with unknown injuries in Medic 3's area at Banksville Rd. & Crane Ave.  We arrived to find that one patient was entraped, but consious complaining of severe leg and stomach pain.  Rescue 2 arrived within minutes and executed a successful and efficient extrication.  The patient had an obvious femur fracure, an open tibia fracture and stomach discoloration due to internal bleeding.  We rushed her to Mercy as an E-0 and got her in the hands of the emergency medicine team.  Stuck around to hear their report which sounded better than what everyone initally thought.  She should live, and I wish her the best of luck.

Because the Steelers game is on now, I'm ending this post, but yeah, it got much busier last night than what I have here.  Take care."

"event","Hey there everyone!  Been a while since I updated my blog, so I figured why not do it today!  Its the 28th, that means in a month, well, 29 days after today, I get to see Aislinn for HOMECOMING WEEKEND!  Its getting closer by the day, and the excitement is really starting to build as I miss her more n more!  But its right around the corner!

Classes are going good, not hard AT ALL! Bio lab presentation tomorrow, and then a Chem exam next week.  Goody. Will be easy though.  Got in touch with my HS athletic trainer/teacher, THE MAN, THE Mr. Paul Scheuch.  It was great hearing from him.  He's the man! THE SCHEUCH.

Steelers lost 23-20.  Sucks.  Other than that, I'm good. Aislinn rocks.  Peace.

"event","Today was long, thats to say the least. 8am Bio Class, and then Lab till 4.  Sucked.  Emotionally, it was a good day.  Things are getting easier with Aislinn and I's relationship.  I havent been depressed this week as I was last week.  I still do miss her though, but its not as ""traumatic"" as it seemed last week.  Its weird though, I wasnt so depressed all through August after she left like I was last week.  I guess it just hit me...  I guess I'll have my good days and my bad ones and good weeks and bad weeks.  Lemmie tell ya, the good days seem to go by much faster than the bad ones.  So let's hope for good days so homecoming comes around fast!!!  Anyway, Bio test tomorrow, back to studying and waiting for Ais's call.

"event","Today and yestrday are the first days in a while where I havent felt depressed or sad all day about missing Aislinn.  This is a good thing haha.   I do miss her to death, I have so much more fun when I'm with her, but I guess I've come to terms with the fact that i WILL get to see her, and that I have to have to be happy with my new environment.  Last week, all I did was miss home, miss everyone, miss Abington Heights, and miss Aislinn.  This week, I havent been so down, while still missing her.  Again, I think this is good because I cant go through life unhappy.  I dont think Aislinn would want that for me, and I certainly dont want that for her.  We have to maintain our love over the distance while still being able to concentrate on our daily lives and not be depressed.

Also, we decided not to count down each day, but rather count every two weeks. That way, 14 days at a time will get out of the way and time will go faster. My mom told me that Ais and I cant text message each other, which sucks because it was always nice getting texts from her during the school day.  Apparently it was too much money on the cell bill.  I want to get that 5 bucks for unlimited text and pix messaging though.  That will rock. :)

Anyway, I'm at school during my two hour break b/t writing and Bio Lab so i'm gonna go. Take care

"event","Today actually was pretty good.  I wasnt too sad or homesick, which was weird because Aislinn forgot her cell and i couldn't text her at all during the day.  Talked to her on her sister's phone this morning prior to class which is always a nice way to start the day.  Classes on Tues/Thrus. are long but not too bad.  I have a Biology exam Friday that I am seemingly prepared for seeing as I attended Dr. Doctor's test review session and knew everything that he went over, and knew it well!  Thats relieving seeing as it's my first MAJOR college exam. Still need to do some studying for it, but at this point, theres no reason for me to be nervous.

Aislinn called me when she got home from field hockey and we talked for about a half hour then I went to do some errands for my mom and dad.  She's supposed to call me pretty soon after she's done with her homework! She gets more than I do and shes in High School! lol. Anyway, I'm gonna quit counting down the days everyday because it seems to make it slow, so I'll just count them at the end of each week.  I figure that if I get 7 days out of the way at a time before I count again, that it will make the progress seem better.  I dont know. Its all psychological I guess haha.

Thats it for today.

"event","Woke up today to Aislinn's phone call at 7:15 AM.  Always a nice way to wake up =) We talked for maybe 25 minutes before she had to get off the phone to go into the High School.  Text messaged her few times throughout the day too =) Shes the best.  Monday's an easy day.  Chem at 12-1250 and the writing from 1-150. Got an essay assignment for writing, ugh.  Just 5 pages though, not too bad.  I lifted for an hour and a half afterwards.  Tryin to lose some fat as well.  I'd like to get down to like 230-35 or so.  Lifted hard today too, I'm physically beat.

Hopefully Aislinn will get my letter in the mail today.  I hope she likes it too. We talk so much but a letter is always nice in my opinion.  She's at field hockey now, so she'll call me after, like around 6:30.  Thats my day so far.  

Just 45 more days until homecoming weekend.  Thats 5 more steelers games worth, or 6 more NFL weeks worth.  hahaha.  I'm finding all kinds of ways to count so that it doesnt sound as long as 45 days.  Although its not too bad, like a month and a half.  It will go by faster once we get into October.  School and sports should keep it moving, as well as talking everyday. It won't be so bad =)

Talked to Duquesne football strength training coach today. He asked me why I didnt play football.  I told him I wasnt sure I wanted to and just wanted to make sure I get off to a good start acedemically. I said I did miss it though.  He said, if I want to, to come out next year, and that'd I'd made a good fullback.  I really dont know.  I'll have to give it some thought.

Ok wow, I wrote a big blog today.  Have a good one.

"event","Just got off the phone with Aislinn.  We talked SO much yestrday.  Must have been like 4 hours combined.  Hour here, hour there, two hours at night.  It was awesome, definitely brightened up my day!

Well today, the Steelers answered any questions about whether ot not they would be as good this year as last year.  34-7 BIG win over Tennessee.  Ben Roethlisberger rocked.  Talked to Aislinn at halftime and then for about an hour afterward.  Shes the best.  I love talking to her.  She can make a bad day good and a good day even better! =)  We're both counting down till homecoming, which I dont know if it will make it go any faster.  Hopefully it doesnt make it slower haha.  46 More days.  Anyway, pappy is over for dinner and football, its a beautiful day, and an easy day at school tomorrow.  Big bio test at the end of the week but it shoudlnt be too hard.  Thats about it for today.  Dinner is cooking and I'm going to talk to pappy.  Take care.

"event","Today was just another day.  Pretty easy actually. Chemistry let out early, and writing class went by fast.  I went in at 1130 and was done by 2.  Really easy day.

Just 48 days after today until homecoming weekend!  Cant wait to see Aislinn.  I miss her so much, and am looking so much foreward to seeing her Oct 28.  Seems long way away but hopefully with school and the steelers and college football and phone calls with Aislinn, the time will go by smoothly and swiftly.  I guess I'll just have to deal with it since there's no magical way to speed up time haha. Wish there was!

Going out to dinner with the family tonight.  Tomorrow is the Duquesne/Fordam football game and sunday is the Steelers first game!

Its going to take a while to get settled here in Pittsburgh.  I like school I guess, but I miss everyone from Clarks Summit, especially Aislinn, like i said before.  I know alot of people up at Duquesne but its going to take some time to get comfortable with them so that i can start hanging out with the guys outside of school.  I dont know, its just who I am i guess.  I've also lost all desire to lift lately, mainly because theres no one here interested in powerlifting, they all lift to get ripped!  So  its boring for me to go to the weightroom and workout by myself.  We'll see what happens.

Overall today I'm doing OK.  Little sad, a little homesickness, but I cant complain about school or the city.  I just miss Ais.

Have a good one everyone.

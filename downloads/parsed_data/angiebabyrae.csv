"event","so, katie and i have been discussing tattoo ideas. i had 2 that were just buns in the oven since high school. but they are finally fully formed ideas. and as soon as i stop being poor, they will hopefully materialize. 

first, man ray:

second, hummingbird:

<img src=""http://www.wisegorilla.com/images/nativeamerican/hummingbird.gif"" />

it's the native american symbol for hummingbird. hummingbirds are worshiped because of the amount of strength they have, despite being so small. that one's for my neck, under my hair.

last night for st. patrick's day, we all hung out and seth's neighbors were having a big bonfire. so, of course, we infiltrated. it was a lot of fun. only the first of many more ithaca bonfires to come this semester, i'm sure. 

in other news, i'm probably staying in ithaca this summer with alicia and drew and pat and seth. and if everything works out with the lease, i'll be living in the big pink house on pleasant. so excited.

love and miss you!"

"event","so, despite all of the shit going on in my major. . . . 

today was good. drew got us free tickets to the full monty because he had been working on the management team for it or something.

tomorrow is going to be fantastic. 

registration at 7. jazz at 2. going to syracuse with katie at 4 to get JILL. seeing JILL. coming back to ithaca. going to rob's show. having a wonderful ithaca weekend with JILL. haha.

seriously though, i am having some huge issues with my major and the department, but it's funny, because, despite it all, i feel so good. 

love ithaca. love my friends. the boys just moved into the summer apartment. it's so nice. i have a wonderful boy. i get to see jill. thanksgiving is in less than 2 weeks, and i will get to see my family. 

<3<3 be well."

"event","it hit 77 degrees today. what the fuck? it was so nice out though. my journalism professor canceled my 2 hour writing lab, so katie and pat and i went to the commons for a little while and got coffee and hung out. dropped pat off at the music school and then katie and i had a picnic at the pond. then later tonight i went for a really long walk by myself. i love nice days. 

this past weekend i went home for fall break. i hadn't been in buffalo since august. what a mindfuck. this time last year, i had only a few acquaintances around campus, i'd already been home a couple times, and i was in syracuse with my unappreciative boyfriend. i remember wanting nothing more than to come home every weekend last october. but this time. . . i went home and got homesick for ithaca. 

it's so strange how things end up working out. how much changes. i finally feel comfortable here. i am single, and am the one being chased, not the one doing the chasing. i have a little family here. it's so nice.

i honestly love my roommates. we discovered that we have a mouse in our suite. as it turns out. . . . sascha is terrified of mice. i walked in on her standing on her desk 4 times this evening. things rarely get boring around here, to say the very least. 

this week should be good. tomorrow i only have history of jazz. so i plan on relaxing and catching up on some work. wednesday, rob's band is playing in town. thursday, rob wants to take me out. friday is colbert at cornell. and then, a typical, wonderful, ithaca weekend. complete with pre-gaming dance parties, parties, episodes of LOST, and trips to the farmer's market. 

ithaca is kind of amazing. and i am kind of really, really happy lately."

i don't understand. i'm not entirely sure how i have this ability to just make myself look like a moron everytime i like someone. like. . . how does that happen. 

on the other hand. . . it is kind of fun. 

oh, and apparently, according to katie, i'm a little heartbreaker these days. 




i know, i laughed also.

"event","So. . . it is 3:30. and I am awake. and still have about a page of this paper to finish for sociology. sometimes i suck at this whole college thing. oh well. it will get done, no worries. 


in other news; ithaca college is so good to me. so good to me :) i love this place. i love my suite, and every one of my roommates. and i love all of our boys in our building and how they basically are like 5 extra roommates. 

chelsea is going to be here on friday [!!!!!!!!!!] and i am soooooo fucking excited for her to see how we all live here. i wanna share this with everyone.  

i reallyyyy need to start sleeping better, but i just can't seem to do that. mine and katie's new evening routine is doing work until all hours of the morning, watching way too many movies back to back, and eating way too much hummus and ben and jerry's. last night we watched the royal tenenbaums, then love actually, then garden state. back to back. our record is 5 movies in one night. we're pathetic. 

tonight, we went to wegmans to return cans and get more pasta. i also bought 4 avocados. then we went home and i actually had every intention of finishing my work at a reasonable hour. but then i had to make guacamole. . . i had to. and then our room was invaded around midnight. the boys came into our room carrying 2 movies, and armfuls of food. so. . . . we made food and watched movies. and now all of the guacamole is gone and i need to go get more avocados. 

i realize how unhealthy our lifestyle is. and if i cared, i would do something about it. 

we really want to get a house next year with the boys. so badly. i just don't know how plausible that would be with 10 people. . . and also, that would be one loud house. . . not to mention, we all need to figure out study abroad stuff first anyways. seriously though. . . how amazing does this sound: fall semester. london. me, katie, drew, john, dante, spencer, chelsea. g-d, i hope that works out. 

alright now. . . back to work now. and then tomorrow is the day from hell. . . and then thursday will be relaxing. . . and friday = chelsea! [jill. my roommate alicia really wants me to go see across the universe with her, but i told her not until i talked to my wife. in other words, get your ass over here!]"

and now i'm wide awake cuz chelsea put me into a giggly mood. 


i never write in my livejournal anymore. 

actually. . . . i think it's kind of a stupid thing to do anyways. so. don't think i will for awhile. don't need public text to make myself feel better about my life. 

yay!

"event","welcome to my good weekend update!

things have been going quite swimmingly lately, if i do say so myself. well, for the most part. 

friday was chill. philosophy quiz, ate early, hung out and watched tv with my roommate and jess for awhile, went over to the boys' room and they were having a party. fun was had by all. 

then, saturday, jess and i went into town. we went grocery shopping at wegmans and then hung out in the commons and ate dinner at quite possibly my favorite restaurant in ithaca. i got a veggie burger and mac and cheese. soooooo good. then we came back and 5 of my friends and i met up with across campus people, and  walked to an off campus party. this incredible band that we love was playing in the basement. it was ridiculously packed, but we pushed our way in and danced a ton and basically just had a kickass time. it got broken up eventually, and we somehow managed to find a ride back and just hung out more. random, but fun night.

yesterday was literally just, chilling all day. slept in, hung out in the room, showered, dinner, dunkin donuts run with jennie [roommate] and her friend, and then lots of reading / tv watching. 

today i did my first photoshoot for photo! it was so much fun. andy agreed to help me out and pose for me, and brought his girlfriend. they were great, even though it was FREEZING outside. it was so much fun though. i can't wait to print them. 

also, drama is lame. fuck that.

tomorrow's [amazing] schedule:
philosophy, my only tues class, got cancelled, sooooooo. . . 

-sleeping in.
-meeting with my journalism professor about my report on the local music scene
-darkroom to develop negatives and make contact sheets 

 yay   :)


oh also. . . for those who do not know. . . i just moved this semester into a real double as opposed to lounge i was in. new building, new roommate, everything. 

and, well, I LIKE IT SO MUCH BETTER. 

reasons i miss the towers: 
-the view was pretty cool from the 13th floor. 
-closer to classes.

reasons i do NOT miss the towers: 
-co-ed floors are way cooler. 
-my view still kicks ass [the city lights are organized to look like a swan at night].
-my new roommate is kind of incredible. 
-i walked through the bottom floor of the towers last week. . . it still smells like vomit."

"event","things have been odd. not bad. just different. i feel like the past three days have been three weeks instead.

things haven't been bad though. a few nights ago i slept over at nate and jacob's with steve, hannah and lindsay. it was quite nice. we all just hung out and listened to music and then hannah and jacob and lindsay got hungry, so they went for a drive and steve and nate and i swam. it was a good night. 

i love summer. 

today we went to look for puppies! we found a prospect. his name is jake and he is a one year old german shephard / beagle mix. he's adorable. we liked him a lot. <img src=""http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/543/ny31867311441xbn1.jpg"" alt=""Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"" />
we still aren't sure if we're going to adopt him or not. it's all up in the air. but at the moment, he's our first choice.

it's going to be so weird having a new dog in the house. i'm so excited though. it'll be good for us.

tomorrow i'm going to my brothers play and then to the lebanese festival with steve. mmmmm falafel. then, who knows what? maybe that free concert? we shall seee. 

there is still so much to do. hiking. camping. hanging out. getting ready for ithaca. drive ins. picnics. my family graduation party next week. bonfires.

i love summer.

end of the school year pictures [and various others] because i'm lazy and only just uploaded them: [half of these are far too large. which i will fix tomorrow.]

i spent the afternoon with my dad. well, he took me to the doctor for my physical for ithaca. they pricked me twice. and now my left arm is sore. i hate needles. my dad watched. and laughed at my wincing. so i made faces at him. we had fun. which sounds weird seeing as we went to the doctor. we went to elmwood afterwards and got coffee. i love my dad. i'm going to miss him a lot next year. a lot. 

last night was jill's graduation party. i had a good time. i think everyone else did too. it was quite nice.

"event","so, this weekend was one of the most hectic and packed weekends ever. despite the craziness and immediate after shock, it was a good weekend. it was. 

quick recap:

friday was mine and catherine's birthday party at jill's house. hannah, sam, sarah jane, and nate came with me. sarah made me a fantastic bracelet with a card that said ""jew. i like you. you're pretty."" sam hugged me a lot. jill gave me a duck and necklaces. catherine was sweet as usual. nate was amusing. hannah smiled a lot. tom was a sweetheart. drama went down with some people. i don't even care. it's so insignificant. 

saturday was prom. no one danced nearly as much as at jill's, but we still had a great time. even if in the long run that realization gets skewed, it was fun. and everyone really did seem to be enjoying themselves. and that's the important part. everyone looked amazing. afterwards, jill, hannah, nate julian, steve, pushpa, dan, dan's girlfriend and i planned to go to jess's. we waited around for a bit and then decided to just go straight to nate's. i think it was a good decision. regardless of what i might say, we had fun. and it was a good night.

today i went to ben, nate, and nick's cookout. i hung out with sarah lister a lot and had a lot of fun. it was such a random grouping of people, but it really did work and despite being dead tired, it was quite nice. 

tomorrow is the last day of high school. ever. 

i'm going to miss people. i really am."

it was a good day for my birthday. i'm satisfied.

things are stressful, but it's almost done. almost there. 

not to mention, there are things to look forward to. definitely. 

this weekend is jill's party for catherine and i. which i am thoroughly excited for. then, saturday is prom. which i am also thoroughly excited for. i'm just retarded though. we realized about two days ago that we have no idea what's going on afterwards. and now i just feel stupid for making tentative plans instead of finalized ones. and for not thinking ahead, as i tend to do. i just feel incompetent sometimes. erg. i suck. it'll be fine though. i am convinced. even if we just end up crashing in nate's basement for awhile, we'll have a great night. i'm not worried. 

okay. .. change of subject. i get too invested too fast. someone fix this. i'm overwhelmed and it's all my own doing.

i dunno. when i sat down, i felt that i had something of significance to write, but now it all seems to be leaving me. 

vermont was alright. i was sort of indifferent to the entire situation. and for whatever reason, i seemed somewhat more out of place than normal. my sister and i basically just hung out most of the time. 

i feel like with approximately 7 days left. . . the hostility towards high school is beginning to cease. i think i'm coming to terms with the four years i've spent here and really starting to make peace with them. i mean, i still have papers and tests because teachers are crazy, but i'm really not stressing. i'm taking it all in stride these days. school's even been somewhat enjoyable the last couple days. it's all about outlook and attitude. people never believe that, but it's really so true sometimes.

and now we get into the random babbling:

the weekend is approaching fast. i'm optimistic. 

um. . . i don't understand why people run away from things? it just doesn't make sense to me. what does that accomplish? i just wish everyone could be completely unguarded with how they're feeling and just say everything that is on their minds with no reservations. if only. 

i get too invested. i fall hard. i fall fast. i fall a lot. . . so sue me. 

my birthday is in less than a week. 666. ooh. 

it really is quite silly that sometimes i develop feelings of resentment towards people i don't even know. i'll work on that.

i need to clean my desk. as soon as humanly possible.

friday, my parents let me leave school early because i wasn't feeling well and jill and chelsea's prom was that night. so, i went to my first 4 periods. . . 2 of which are free periods. came home. took a nap. got ready. then hannah and i went to jill's and had sex. and fun. then prom. at first it was kinda awkward because, y'know, not my prom. and other stuff.  but it got real comfortable real quick. and we just had funnnn. i'm so glad i went. after, we all went to hard rock and ate, and then back to jill's where we chilled / finally crashed. it was just such a great night. thanks guys for letting me share that with you! i only hope mine goes as well as friday went. 

i came home yesterday afternoon and did nothing for awhile and slept. then, i met up with jill and our new friend, chuck [!!!], at spot. we hung out and talked for a bit. then, i picked up nate and we met up with sarah, nick, and jon at ben's where we hung out and watched sin city. it was just nice and relaxed. good night. 

and then tonight ben, jill and i decided to go see the da vinci code downtown. it was cool. very fun. on the way home, jill and i decided to get nostalgic and stopped at lake effect and talked for a bit. 

tomorrow i think i'm working at cepa for a bit and then skating. wednesday is hebrew high graduation. thursday is awards / yearbooks / springfest. and then a four day weekend in vermont.

this weekend has been so wonderful. 

it was chels's birthday, but i had the final night of the play to do. the show went well. but more importantly, we had so much fun. so much fun. this may sound odd, seeing as how much grief it caused at the time, but. . . i am going to miss the play so so much. i've done shows before, but something about this one. . . people just clicked. and it worked. and i'm going to miss that. after the show, i went to the cast party for a bit with ben, nate, nick, and jon. then we went to eat. then we dropped some people off. then nick and i went to ben's to watch a movie and i fell asleep. and then i dropped nick off and the sun was starting to come up a little. and it seemed really quiet and peaceful. so i parked and read for a bit.

i do regret not seeing chels though. i owe her a ton for that. once i get the money in order, i'll make it up to her.

then tonight i went to the cepa gallery to help with the auction they had. i worked for a little under 3 hours, but they gave me 5 hours anyways. it was interesting. and i got to see the exhibit for free. cool. then i got sleepy, so i got coffee. and i was near jill's friend max's house. and he invited me over to his party for a bit. it was fun. i like meeting new people. then i drove jill home and we talked. and i like that a lot. 

and i just had a great conversation with nate. i'm so proud of him. and a lot of people. including myself lately. 

and tomorrow, my lesson has been cancelled!!! so, i'm gonna read. and read. a lot. i'm excited. haha. 

side note: whatever i've said in the past about hating when people call me ""angie"". fuck that. haha. i think i missed it. 

next friday is jill and chelsea's prom. i'm excited. it will be fun. 

good lord, i feel new.

"event","i thank the weather for calming everyone down. or maybe i'm the only one being calmed. regardless, i thank it for dulling the impact of. . . everything. 

things finally feel like they are truly falling into place. of course i'm still not fully at peace with some things. they don't just disappear. but, still, they don't feel as important. and maybe they really just aren't. there's still so much going on right now that i need to deal with and get done, but i'm not as panicked about it all. 

today was good. i had my government ap this morning. which was my final ap [quite relieved]. we got out during 5th and i didn't have to go to 5th or 6th and i have 7th free. so, we all just hung out on the lawn for a couple hours. then 8th we did nothing as per usual, and 9th i played tennis with pushpa, elena and michelle. . . kinda. . . walked home, took a short nap, called jill, had ice cream, went to rehearsal. 

rehearsals have been increasingly more enjoyable. everyone really seems to be clicking. i can't speak for everyone else, but personally, i'm having a ton of fun. it doesn't feel like work. sometimes you do get that impact of ""oh my g-d. . . i do not want to be on stage right now"", but then it kinda turns into ""cool, i'm hanging out with my friends for 4 hours"" which is the completely wrong attitude. . . but, at least we're having fun, right? we do need to buckle down though, the first show is thursday. and we are not ready. at all. the show kinda sucks, and our preparation was rushed and just all in all, we need MORE TIME. buuuuuuttt, we don't get anymore. . . soooo, i guess we'll just see how it all goes. 

it's funny how really little things can just make you so happy for no logical explaination at all. it's funny how sometimes those really little things take up your whole mindset and eventually make you miserable. but, it's funny, because when they start out, they're incredible. 

i adore this song immensely. it makes me calm. and summery-feeling. it makes me want to go out at night and lie in the grass on a blanket with someone and star gaze until the sun comes up. can we watch the sun rise this summer? please?

OH! by the way. . . kind of a total change of plans. . . but. . . i'm going to ithaca. i'm so excited. i can't wait. amazing journalism school, good concerts, gooooood food, BEAUTIFUL surroundings. i can't wait for hiking and camping and new experiences and college in general. 

i can't wait until summer. it will be absolutely stunning and wonderful. 

be well. <3<3"

today was good. school. . . was school. a couple tests. an unexpected free period. lying outside / studying / music during 7th. tennis. not a bad day. then rehearsal. which was fun. it went well. i was actually satisfied. it only lasted about an hour though instead of three because our director had to leave for some emergency at work. i'm not complaining. 

then jill and nate came and picked me up and we drove around for awhile. met up with hannah and chelsea and went to dinner / coffee and hung out. it was so nice. they make me smile and laugh so much. i missed nate. when we drove jill home and were listening to music and talking, i just kinda wished we would never have to drop her off and could just keep driving all night. after we dropped off jill, nate and i were driving by the school and ""wish you were here"" came on and he started singing. and i forget why, but i said ""i can't wait to leave amherst."" and he goes ""we will before you know it."" and turned up the music a little. and it was just so. . . good and / or sad / thoughtful feeling. 

we heard from ithaca last night. an opening in the journalism school opened. so they offered it to me. i talked to jessie who's going there undeclared because she didn't get into the journalism school. she told me she hopes i take the offer because it's an amazing opportunity and really difficult to get into. i'm so confused. i have a lot to think about still. my dad was so excited. he started talking about the school and how wonderful it is and it's reputation and all. i know i would love it there. i just don't know what i'm ready for yet. i need to decide by monday morning. i need to suck it up, and stop being indecisive.

part of me feels like i should just stay and go to UB / binghamton. i just don't want to settle, y'know? i've ""settled"" so many times already. and, maybe it's me being selfish or conceited, but lately i've been feeling like i deserve a lot better than i've been getting.

on saturday i went to chelsea's dad's with chels and jill. we watched about half of white chicks and a good chunk of almost famous. and acted goofy and danced and ate and i watched the two of them inhale popcorn. . . then hannah showed up briefly and the fun continued. honestly, i adore them so much. it was a great night. 

then yesterday, hannah picked me up and we went to the kenan show with sam where we met up with xjustinx and corey and some other cool photo kids and ms elston, of course. the weather was incredible and everyone was in a good mood and i had a lot of fun. i think everyone else did too. i hope so anyways. honestly, i love ms elston so much. she does so much for us and really puts all of her energy into us. we owe a tonnnnn to her. i wanna do something really nice for her at the end of the year [(c)hannah / xjustinx, start brainstorming!]. 

after kenan, hannah and sam and i drove to elmwood and went the knox for [literally] a few minutes since sam had passes to use. then we took a walk and ate falafel and sat and enjoyed the weather. and hannah kept taking pictures! and letting us take pictures of her! it was a first. again, i had a ton of fun and we laughed so hard. 

i love my friends to death. i truly am sorry that i take them for granted sometimes. i don't mean to ever. i just get carried away. i'll honestly try to work on that. because they are incredible. they keep me sane. 

today was even pretty good. the photo room was enjoyable as always. then i had 7th period free and i went outside with some people and took a nap on the front lawn in the sun. now my face has a little tint and has that tired feeling that you get after getting more sun than you're used to. it's such a lovely, summery, nostalgic feeling. hannah and i drove jacob home and we talked. i missed him. then i got home and went to skating where i fell on my ass. not on the ice. i'm talented. during my session the monitor also played golddigger and ashlee simpson. i thought of chelsea. then i had a nice loong conversation with jillie-an. we're in love.

i hope it's a good thing. 

lately, i'm just so used to being disappointed by people. and i don't want to be making anyone else feel how i do right now. hopefully, that's where that consistency plays a part. . . 

honestly. i can't stand you when she's around. you're insensitive and condescending and just mean. and i hate it. and i hate her. and i hate the entire situation. and mostly, i hate myself for even caring. i hate having to feel like i'm so much younger or less important or uninformed when we're all together. i hate that you can't stay the same person throughout the course of a day. you could be so amazing. you are amazing. i don't understand you sometimes though. ugh. 

i hate being the one making all this effort only to CONTINUOUSLY be let down. time after time after time. if you don't want to do it, then DON'T. but please. please don't pretend that you do and then just never inform me of how you actually feel. that makes me feel ten times worse than any forward rejection. honest. 

i hate feeling unimportant. 

i hate feeling like a fucking burden. 

i know. . . so. . . why don't i stop being the one making all the effort? stop stressing and caring. just relax and let people come to me. why don't i?

because no one would care. no one would come to me. i've tried all that.

it doesn't work. 

i always feel like i'm never given a valid chance. a chance to defend myself, a chance to move forward, a chance to really prove myself. why is that sooo much to ask for? they're just words. they don't take long to say. 

and the thing is. . . it's probably all my own g-ddamn fault anyways. so, in the end. . . i'm actually just a hypocrite.

dammit, i wish you hadn't blown me off because you were too drunk to remember that we had plans as many times as you did. . . 

oh well. it's over and done. i think."

tonight was good. i like laughing.

""fuck walking. we can destroy the environment instead.""
""fuck yeah. it's earth day.""

i really don't know what i meant to say here. 

things feel slow. or weird. i can't really tell. 

i have to learn when to give up. i'm persistent. losing touch doesn't settle well with me. these relationships are kind of something that i find to be amazing. that's why i put forth the effort. if you don't want me to, tell me. it'll all be so much quicker that way. 

don't take for granted everything that i do. take care of the people you love. but, first, you have to realize that you love them. don't run away.

"event","went to toronto. 

i dunno, call my sentimental, but something about driving along the gardener's expressway into the city always gets to me. there are a few cities where i've spent a really nice chunk of my life. toronto being one of them. burlington being another. they both give me really good feelings when we start to get closer. different, but good. like, with burlington, you're on a bunch of little back roads and passing farms and you see a whole landscape of mountains, and you almost feel like you might start to cry, or like you could write a whole novel in that one minute or something. and with toronto, you're on the expressway, going along real fast, and you start to see the skyrise and all the buildings, and you get this little nervous happy feeling in your stomach and you feel like you might just burst out laughing. such good feelings. unsurpassable. matchable. but unsurpassable.

this time felt a little different though. because i kept thinking about the prospect of possibly living there.

i hope everyone had a beautiful day.

i'm thinkin that tonight i might be lame. . . and do something i haven't done in a really long time. . . but that i used to do all the time. . . and set my alarm for 4:30. . . and go out onto the deck. . . and make some tea. . . and write until the sun comes up. . . 

care to join? i'm not even remotely kidding.

"event","i'm really very awake right now. it sucks a lot. but who am i to complain? nighttime is beautiful in such a curious way. being awake late at night gives off such a great feeling that you're the only one around to witness what's going on around you. it's such a feeling of infinity. like morning is never going to come. some of my most treasured memories ever have been late at night, feeling infinite. 

tonight hannah, jill, chelsea and i went ""star gazing"". it was actually pretty cloudy, so we just enjoyed the nice night and each other's company. i'm not complaining. i adore them more than i could ever possibly try to express. 

man, i can't stop thinking. it's like a plague.

remember when we used to despise one another? remember when you walked me home at 2:30 and when we got to my driveway, i didn't want to go inside. . . so we lied down on the island and i fell asleep and you told me that it never occurred to you that you should wake me up? remember when i had trouble sleeping anywhere but your bed? remember how no one would star gaze with me except you? remember when you told me that i was the only girl you'd ever loved, and ironically, the only one you'd never thought about kissing? remember when my heart got broken and i called you in tears even though i knew you didn't want to hear it, and you told me that everything would work out in the end? and remember when i asked you how you knew you said, ""because you're not typical. you don't give up.""? remember when we intrigued one another? remember the night we were scheduled to work together and we were excited about it, and afterwards neither of us wanted to sleep so you snuck me onto your back porch and we talked about the moon and about in what high regards we hold one another? remember when i told you that i really disliked most of your friends and you told me, ""well, that's because you're better than almost all of them.""? remember when you told me your secret and i said ""sweetheart, there's something on your face,"" and when i touched you i realized you were crying? remember how i constantly wanted to find you a girlfriend because you deserve one so much, but then i would find problems with all of them because they weren't good enough? remember when i stayed over and you gave me your room so that i wouldn't have to sleep with a room full of boys i didn't know? remember when you told me that you could never figure me out and that was uncommon for you, but it was what you loved best about me?

"event","things are weird. weird. weird. weird. weird. weird. i dunno.

last night was honestly great. jill and i went on a date. we went to spot and entered the twilight zone. i swear. the weirdest fucking things ever kept happening. then we went for a walk. and then we wanted to go to the water, so we drove. which was silly. annnnnnd we got lost. then we finally got there and talked. and then it got cold and went back to the car. and had sex. actually we just talked forever. and it was great. then we drove home and talked in her driveway. and then i came home.

and today. . . i'm not even sure what i feel about today. i mean. . . when you really look at it. . . well, then it SUCKED. like. . . not even just ""oh, it was alright."" it just was terrible. but there were random little parts that gave me random little good feelings. so, in retrospect it didn't seem as bad. i dunno. i realized i need new community service options. so i called the historical society and the cepa gallery. so, hopefully that's all gonna work out. then i went to get an application from the amherst. i swear. . . sometimes i wish i would grow like 3 extra inches on the spot. then i went to starbucks just 'cause. and the woman there knows my father and i and saw my application and was like ""well, you'd better be applying here too, hun."" and she gave me an application even though i'm too young right now and signed my references and told me that i'm a good kid. it was cute. 

i really enjoy driving. especially when it was like how it was today. and the window is all the way down. and listening to ani [thanks a lot jill. . . ]. it was just such a nostaligic summery feeling. 

i went to go see great big sea with my parents. they were really great. the last time i saw them was falcon ridge like 5 years ago. it was a good show. somewhat ruined by a few things, but nothing i can't get over. at some point. 

in other news: people really need to start figuring themselves out. NOW. before i start getting mad. people need to realize that there are only so many times you can change your g-ddamn mind. STOP BEING SOOO SELF MOTIVATED. it's not setting well with my self esteem. i'm so tired of giving people chances that they just end up abusing terribly. this is really about a few things. so if you're trying to figure out what i'm talking about, don't worry about it. i'm just soured about a lot of things. i need to sit down and really think about things. i'm disappointed.

side note: the pharmacy is soon. i'm excited. who wants to come with usss??? it'll be fun.
side note number two: SOMEONE make me start going running or something. i'm lazy and gaining weight and feel gross. better yet, someone come work out with me. 
note even further to the side: i STILL want to get my nose pierced."

"event","okay, so, maybe it's because i've been in solitude for the past three days. . . or maybe it's because this cold has made me delirious. . . or maybe it's just me being me. . . but i feel like i'm pushing everyone away. and i don't know why anymore. i mean, i had my ""justifications"" at first. . . but, honestly, who was i trying to convince? them or me? 

i mean. i feel bad. i feel like i've been neglecting literally everyone. it really is not a good realization. i dunno what to do anymore though. like, i was trying to think of something to do tonight. . . and realized how many friends i really don't have anymore. lots of accquaintances. not friends so much. and i also realize. . . it's all my own doing. it's not anyone's fault but my own. i'm not complaining. i'm just realizing. 

i guess i'm just sick of all the pretending. i'm sick of hanging out with people and compromising who i really am. i'm sick of pretending to be juniors in college. that day will come. but, honestly now. . . we're 17. . . 18 years old. 18 years old is not an adult. all legality aside. . . it just isn't. find me one person who is truly mature and capable at this age and then maybe i'll compromise my argument a little, but i really don't think any of us are. 

i miss people. i really do. but i have to realize that there comes a point when you have to realize that things were good and wonderful, and you're always going to have that. things just change sometimes. it's nature. it's life. it happens. deal with it. deal with it, ang. it sucks that i'm losing touch, because that's just really really uncharacteristic of me. it really is. but i don't know how else to do this. i want to see them, but it's just fact that my idea of fun doesn't coincide with theirs anymore. and that sucks, but it happens. and the fact of the matter is, the balance used to work out nicely, and i used to be able to pretend for a night or two, but i can't compromise myself to make everyone else happy anymore. which sounds selfish. because it is. but sometimes being selfish is called for. not being blind-sighted by being selfish. or ruling out everyone else's feelings. but just keeping yourself in mind. i think it's really common to forget about that. it's okay to want to be happy. . . it's okay to realize when things that used to make you happy don't anymore. it's okay. 

i just want to lie around with someone and have a real conversation. forget about who's going to college where. forget about who insulted who during school yesterday. forget about who broke who's heart. and just be completely honest. and WONDER. because i think that's the most childish thing anyone can do. and i mean ""childish"" in the most amazing sense of the word. there's so much we don't know. so acknowledge it. because there's a difference between being ignorant and being curious. jill and i are going to have a ""date"" tonight like we used to when i would have days off over the summer. and we'll talk. and i have a feeling that it'll be quite nice.

so, if anyone ever feels like they wanna slow down a little. and stop growing up so fast. and feel like taking a night off and contemplating a bit. . . just give me a call. you know i'd be more than up to it."

it wassss. . . . THE PHARMACY / MATTY POPCHART / KIMYA DAWSON SHOW AT 29 CUSTER! complete with white houses cover. oh wow. that seriously made my day. what an awesome surprise. i kept forgetting that hannah taped it. so gooood. 

after the show footage ended i just let the tape play cuz i was lazy. . . and i got another surprise! there was all this stuff that hannah taped of me, hannah, bel, brida, mariah, zach, sam, gabi, jacob and molly one night when we all went to the old smallwood playground at the beginning of the summer. i think it was the night before custer, actually, when we all stayed at bel and brida's. its hilarious. i forgot about that night. none of it makes any sense whatsoever. its wonderful. such randomness. beautiful.

jill called and woke me up around 11:30 [we'relame] and i layed in bed and we talked until about 1[stilllame]. it was nice. and all sunny and whatnot. and real pretty out. 

i basically just chilled all day. it was very very nice. then i had violin. which i wasn't prepared for. . . so i was nervous [my teacher is slightly insane]. 

but it went extremely well. . . she was in a good mood. or i was in a good mood. or something. it was just ten times better than most of my lessons. 

then i picked up jill and we went to spot.

we sat on the couch and had sex. then we realized that the man sitting across from us was the same guy from the night we went to starbucks who was having that deep conversation with his father. . .and he was there the day that we hung out with suze and eryn and hannah. . .so weird. we talked about camp. we're jewish a little bit. it's attractive. hannah showed up and we all did it. a few times. then we all went to our respective cars. when we got to jills house we parked in the drive way and had a 30 min. dance party. pretty intense shit, man. i broke my curfew. sitting in my moms car. in jills drive way. listening to / singing to shitty music. im the coolest person alive. 

oh, by the way. apparently we're starting a band. we're going to start out by doing covers. . . but we will only do covers of vanessa carlton songs. [with the occassional exception made for lords of acid]. jill thinks our name should be ""compressible     ."" i think our name should be ""jill'sadumbwhore"". 

damn. i worked out yesterday with feifei. my abdominals hurt. [a.d.d.much?]

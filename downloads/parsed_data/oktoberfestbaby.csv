I met a gay barista one today at West End and he gave me my bagel and cream cheese/large coffee combo for an astounding seventy-five cents, I think because I asked, and was genuinely interested in, why he looked so blue.

""Because I dropped the ball,"" he snidely replied.

""In what way?"" I questioned while warily eying the strawberry cream cheese he talked me into being spread on my bagel (say: bay-gelle) and he said something about a boy and a boyfriend and breaking up, but he said it really quickly in that gay-boy-recounting-a-love-affair speedtalk where you think that all they really want to do is get to the punch line. Such was the case, as he explained that he was the south pole to all other gay boy south poles, never to find a north pole, never to attract. I nodded, regretted the cream cheese coercion and fortified a friendship that I think might get me discount iced coffee for the rest of my days. 

This afternoon I hung out with Shima, who is not a boy at all but rather an adorable girl from Dubai living at the Ronald McDonald house who has an awful esophagul problem. Her diminished stomach causes her to lose weight, and her father is trying to make her gain weight, which means I actually get supported in my endeavors to take her out to ice cream on a near obsessive scale. We've started going twice a week, and we have coupons for free blend-ins at Thomas Sweet, so life is pretty awesome.

I know LiveJournal isn't the place to be happy, but I am now and feel okay saying so. I don't have many friends, but I'm busy enough not to notice, and I'm coming to terms with what it means to have your best ones scattered across the continental US (someone move to Hawaii please, and make that adjective irrelevant.) It means plane rides instead of train rides and I think I'm okay with that. I know I am, I just need some dumb job to fund it and give me weeks off so Miami, Seattle, Minneapolis, upstate New York and LA are closer than they appear. 

I can't wait to move into my cute room in a small state and have a couch that people can crash on."

"event","Really fucking upset about Mike again.

Hate that he has so many positive comments on his MySpace and that generally speaking, he seems to care about everyone else ever more than me. Also think it's fucked that Lauren still comments on his page, when she cheated on Vadim with him and now she and Vadim are moving to California together. And I'm pretty sure Vadim has no idea  A) how close the two of them were and the extent to which she emotionally betrayed him or B) that she and Mike have matching tattoos. Does this matter at all? No. But I'm still so sad.

He's this constant reminder of emotional and physical rejection and I don't even know why this hurts so badly.

Fuck. 

I mean, really. All it takes is thinking of him, briefly, and my night is wrecked. And I can't even call him on it, because A) he's not really doing anything to hurt me and B) I don't have time to hang out anyway so whatever and C) I'll look crazy, like I always do. Is this love? What is this? What is this pain? Oh, wait, I know. Me being pissed off about not getting something that I want. And have wanted. My entire college career.

I wish he never kissed me.

No. Not true.

I wish he would do it again."

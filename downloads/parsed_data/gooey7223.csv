"event","what's today...hmm tuesday. salon was just fine. pretty slow. caught up on some reading and afterwards had church choir practice for awhile. went extremely well. preparing for easter service. i love easter. don't we all? boo on those who don't ha. anyways. the weather was awesome today. finally. so i took the guitar and went down the NB beach for awhile...JUST missed the sunset grrr! twins came down after they had their tattooes finished up over in MC. they look AWESOME. where's mine? bah. i'm undecided. whipped home in time for american idol. but look what happens. it came on earlier. grrr again. i WILL not let this get me down. back to the comp for more tabs. and......the verdict is in. i'm here and everyone else is anywhere but here. spring break for all the fun ppl and school for the mags. what is that? luckily i'm gonna be fine. no comment on that. hah. back to tabbing...

i'm going through withdrawls...

Maybe different, but remember
Winters warm there you and I,
Kissing whiskey by the fire 
With the snow outside
And the summer comes
The river swims at midnight
Shiver cold
Touch the bottom, you and I
With muddy toes

Stay or leave
I want you not to go
But you should
It was good, as good goes
Stay or leave
I want you not to go
But you did

Wake up naked drinking coffee,
Making plans to change the world
While the world is changing us...
It was good good love.
You used to laugh under the covers
Maybe not so often now
But the way I used to laugh with you
Was loud and hard

Stay or leave
I want you not to go
But you should
It was good as good goes
Stay or leave
I want you not to go
But you did

So what to do
With the rest of today's afternoon, hey
Isn't it strange how we change
Everything we did
Did I do all that i should

That I could'a done

Remember we used to dance
And everyone wanted to be
You and me
I want to be too
What day is this
Besides the day you left me?
What day is this
Besides the day you went?

So what to do
With the rest of the day's afternoon, hey
Well isn't it strange how we change
Everything we did
Did I do all that I could

GO AWAY unless you can give me a spring break and send me to sweden. ok? thanks. make checks payable to ""maggie vs. america"" much appreciation. i'm the same. your the one who changed.

"event","it's raining out. well sprinkling? same thing...maybe? hmm. woke up at 8am but laid in bed for over an hour. i disgust myself. lazy. well...had a long day prior to this morning so it was deserved. eh now i'm trying to excuse my behavior...slight lol...worked on my usual clients at the salon this morning...subway for lunch. this jared diet isn't doing me anything. grrr. call my lawyer! ;) came home early around hmmm 3ish? not feeling on top of things today and certainly not feeling like myself. tummy=upset. a certain instructor is giving me problems and in turn my body is punishing me for letting her get under my skin. how did this get turned around on me? better loling now...*finding humor* so here i am at home reading ""the o'reilly factor"" by bill o'reilly. good book. i don't suggest anyone reads it before they have formed their own opinion on the subjects he discusses. it's very persuasive. maybe that's a good thing? sometimes not tho...educate yourself. my parents are now on this big organic kick. i'm semi-enjoying it. the peanut butter is a bit thicker and these morning power drinks are kinda powdery but energizing. but hey i'll do it for the sake of my dad. he's a great guy and the doc said drastically changing his eating habits will cut down his chances of having to go through with surgery. *phew* so i'm joining the fam instead of having to buy my own personal junk food. conformist? ya maybe but it's a good thing this time! i swear! *chuckle* back to reading. maybe some guitar today? my finger tips hurt tho. ouch. i'm a baby and no need to post comment on that which is obvious! :) errr i need to register to vote too. all these things. so little time. who am i kidding...i've got all the time in the world. xoxo mags"

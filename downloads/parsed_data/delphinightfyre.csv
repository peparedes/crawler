Hmm... I'm in New York again (woot)and trying to check my email... but for some reason my account just wont work! It says my username or password is incorrect but I know I'm typing it right. I tried calling my mom to see if maybe they got rid of AOL but every time I call no one is home. Grr... lack of email = frusteration.

Yesterday me and Jerry went to Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey. It was really fun. My favorite rides were Nitro, Superman and Medusa. Medusa was closed when we first got there which made Jerry sad since its his favorite ride there. It opened up later in the day but had the longest wait out of any of the rides. (I think we waited about an hour... maybe a little longer. ) Overall the park wasn't very crowded. Medusa and Superman had the longest waits while all the other rides we probably waited under 15 minutes to get on. The weather was really nice too. Sunny with a delightful cool breeze. It started getting cold later in the day though.

I like New York a lot. I'll be happy when I actually move out here. I just hope I'll be able to build up the courage to walk around the city by myself by then."

Work work work... it seems thats what lifes about, eh? I'm so sick of working with food. It just seems so gross and my hands get sticky and my shoes and clothes get dirty... bleh!

I've been so tired and fatigues lately. I decided to call this new illness the ""Krisbola virus"". The symptoms are:
-trouble falling asleep at night
-constant waking at odd hours
-oversleeping (10 hours or more) and waking up still tired
-strange dreams involving turning into a shark and swimming in a hot tub.

If you experience any two of these symptoms, consult a physician and do not delay! 

Here is a conversation from work today:
Guy with beanie: ""Is that you thats listening to trance in the backroom?""
Me: ""Yeah... well... its Sarah McLaughlin remixed, but I like trance.""
Guy with beanie: ""Oh yeah? What kinds do you like?""
Me: ""Hmm... I like euro and progressive and melodic... pretty much all of it except for house.""
Guy with beanie: ""Yeah, I don't like house either. I spin euro at some clubs in San Diego.""
Me: ""Really? Thats pretty cool.""
Guy with beanie: ""Do you spin at all?""
Me: ""Me? Oh no... I don't know how. It would probably sound awful.""
Guy with beanie: ""Naw, its really easy. You just need to match the beats."" 

At this point more customers walked in.

Guy with beanie: ""Well I better get out of the way. See you later.""

I kind of wondered whether or not he was hitting on me. Doubtful though. *Flashes engagement ring* WHOOSH!

My brother always walks in while I'm on the computer and tries to read what I'm writing. (it just happened 2 seconds ago) What a little twerp. I yelled at him and he tries to act all innocent. Whatever. I'm going to bed. My Krisbola virus is kicking in."

"event","<font size=2><font face=""verdana"">I ate at Cocos tonight and now I feel sick. I got pasta with shrimp... it came with garlic bread and the garlic bread was burned. I was not pleased. At least I didn't pay though. It was a family outting and we were going to eat at Applebees, but there was an hour wait. (I've never eaten there before... but what I see in the commercials certainly looks tastey.)

I go back to New York on the 16th!! Wooooooo! <font size=1> I'm so broke now... x_x <font size=2>

I recently started talking to my ex, Sean, through email. I thought it would be okay since we've been broken up for a while... but I dunno... I sometimes get this weird, uncomfortable vibe when I read his letters. Also... he seems a little vindictive and it feels like he's trying to make me feel guilty. Well, sorry bub. I don't feel guilty at all. In fact, I feel absolutely perfect. Wheeee! (Except for this nastey Cocos delivered stomach ache! Blarg!)
Maybe if I'm uneasy reading his next letter I will call off the whole thing and go back to no talking. It felt a little better that way anyway.

I have to open tomorrow at work and the people that closed tonight don't do a good job. Yay."

"event","I had a dream with Jerry in it last night. It gave me a very peaceful, happy feeling. It hurts to be separated again, but my dream seemed so real it made it feel as if I hadn't even left. Its weird how sometimes in your dreams you can hear, feel, smell, and see what isn't really there.

Kim finally found some bedding for her dorm! <b> Congratulations! </b> *throws confetti* I showed her Donnie Darko too. Thats a good movie. Everyone should see it. It'll change your life!!! (Thats what my brother in law said about Boondock Saints... thats a good movie too, but not a lifechanger. )

I was sitting at the airport with Jerry being sad while joking around about losing my ticket or staying longer. I really wanted to stay. I was having a great time in New York being with the man I love. So... I stayed! Only for another week, but still. 

I'm going to have to figure out what to do while Jerry is at work. I'm sure I'll think of something. I'm really happy I stayed though. Its so not like me. It proves that even someone as constantly doldrum as me can take chances and have adventures. *Waves an ""I heart NY"" flag about*"

"event","<font face=""verdana""><font size=2> Sheena and I hung out today. I guess I can forgive her for sounding so down on the phone yesterday. Turns out she's having a tough time doing the right thing. She FINALLY decided never to speak to Brian again. Good for her. Brian is pretty much the description of a bad boyfriend. But still, breaking up can be pretty hard. Its not like Sheena did it because she didn't love him anymore.
As for what Sheena and I did, well... we went to Souplantation for lunch. It was really crowded and we actually had to wait to be seated. *Sigh* That will be the last time Sheena and I go to Souplantation together... She's moving this Sunday to San Diego to live with her mom. After that we went to Target, Sheena had to buy make-up and I decided to buy some magazines to read on the plane tomorrow. Then we went back to my house and watched Escaflowne. It made me all sad because it reminded me of all the good times back in early high school and Emily and my arguments over who was better. <b> (Van is better and always will be.) </b>

After Sheena left I decided to play FFXI which turned out to be REALLY frusterating. I have to do this stupid level cap quest in order to get over level 50... but its really hard! You HAVE to get high level players to help you. I asked and asked and no one would help me. Then someone lied to me and said they were doing the quest and it turned out they were doing a completely different quest and they needed me because I'm a white mage. Well... I was mad. So I left them. I even offered tons of players money (even though I have barely any...) and still no one would help... All my friends have already completed the quest WITHOUT ME. I'm so out of the loop. I know... I know... its just a game. But it really sucks when no one is willing to help. Plus I'll be gone all weekend. I don't want to fall behind... Leveling up is really boring unless you have friends in the party with you...

Well I suppose I should try and take a nap. The shuttle is picking me up at 2am tomorrow. (My flight doesn't even leave until 7am...) I'll probably get to the airport around 3:30am and just have to sit there... This is what I get since my family doesn't care about me. (My mom didn't want to drive me because my 13 year old brother can not get up for school on his own... wtf? And his school is like a block away. What a lazy ass.)"

"event","<font face=""verdana""><font size=2> I hate waking up early for work. For some reason, even if I get 8 hours of sleep, waking up at 6am just leaves me so exhausted! ( Well.. I haven't been getting 8 hours of sleep lately... but that doesn't matter. Getting up before 8:00 should be a crime. )

Silent Hill 4 is set to come out this fall! <b>It will be mine, oh yes, it will be mine. </b> But I need someone to play it for me because it looks too scary... o_o;


Everytime I play FFXI I always come back to AIM with like 20 messages. Because I have AOL, I can't turn off my IM when I'm away. It kind of sucks. Oh well... 

I'm so frusterated with Sheena... She called today wanting to know if I was available to hang out. The tone of her voice made it sound like she wanted to hang out because she felt she had to. That isn't right. She didn't sound happy at all to talk to me. My lack of friends is really tearing me apart inside."

"event","<font face=""verdana""><font size=2>Today is Monday... but all day it has felt like a Tuesday for some odd reason. 

I got my hair dyed and highlighted today. It looks really cool. (well... I think so anyway.) Underneith is really really dark red, almost black. Then on top I have blonde and tons of different shades of red streaked about. I am very pleased with my hairdresser. 

<b>If anyone lives in Temecula, Sharon at Salon 29 does a fantastic job! Make an appointment today!</b>

The whole process took a pretty long time. I worked 7-3 and my appointment went from about 3 until 5:15-5:20ish. (The salon is right across the parking lot from where I work so booking an appointment right when I got off work was OK.)

After my hair was finished I went home and asked if I had any messages. There was one written down from some trade school (those trade schools are always after me...) but not one from the person I was expecting to call. I asked my mom if anyone else had called. 
""Well your brother asked if you were home a while back so I think he took another message for you.""
So I ask my brother.
""Did anyone call for me?""
""Yes I wrote it down.""
""Besides the money-hungry trade school?""
""No.""
""...are you sure?""
Then my mom chimed in. ""I thought someone else called?""
""Yeah, but I forgot who it was.""
Good thing I already knew, because I had told Connie to call me when she got home from college so we could hang out. Stupid good for nothing bad message taking brother!!!
Me and Connie went out and got sushi... well <b>I</b> got sushi. Connie got dumb yakisoba. Whats up with that? She also tried Miso soup for the first time and didn't like it. I had a tempura shrimp roll and some smoked sake (salmon... mmm... too much wasabi though!)

After that we went and saw Eurotrip. It was a pretty dumb movie but it made me laugh. Too many fake boobs.

I worked with the Emily girl this morning. She's really nice and we like all the same bands! Wow! Maybe we can be friends."

I did a lot of extra things at work yesterday (Friday) so when my alarm went off at 7:00am this morning (Saturday) and I was supposed to be at work at 8:00am I said, ""Screw it."" and went back to sleep until 8:05. I ended up getting to work around 8:45am thinking I'd still be able to handle everything (I open the store by myself). 

Boy was I wrong. Turns out we had a huge promotion that no one bothered to tell me about. I arrived at work with the phone ringing and ringing and my boss frantically trying to get a hold of me (I later find out that he called my house twice too). Ya know... I wouldn't have slept in if someone had done their job and told me about the stupid promotion. The lack of communication between management and employees at my work is horrid.

There was a new girl handling the promotion. Her name is Emily. She seems like a very nice girl. (She plays the piano just like me!) She's also only 18 AND married. She said what people say about marrige is a lie, nothing really changes, except you get to sleep with each other. (I know I know... some people do that even when they're not married. But sleeping next to your ""husband"" has a more pleasant ring to it than sleeping next to your ""boyfriend"".)

I want to get married."

With FFXI this will pose a major problem. It takes over an hour just to get a party together. I pay $13 a month to play that... Whats up with this limited time anyway? I'm 20 years old for crying out loud. My grades and job don't suffer because I use the computer... I don't know what gives. My parent's say that by using the computer I'm throwing my life away. Gee... I'm sorry I don't do the average college-person's activities. I guess instead of using the computer I'll go out, get drunk and stoned, and have sex with random people, places or things.

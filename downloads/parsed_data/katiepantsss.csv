I havent taken a break all day, so thats-a what im-a gonn-a do.  i have to work downtown tomarrow.  which really isnt that bad of a thing, i mean  make pretty decent money.  its just that since im serving alcohol and i have boobs, men think that im basically stripper-like.  im not trying to say anything bad about strippers at all. I just hate the fact that men think that they can get away with anything simply because im working for tips.  thats really shitty. anyways.  im really tired of crap... it seems like everyone around me has a pretty decent relationship.  and even if its not the best relationship in the world, it still makes it easier to come home from a bad day and have someone there to help you with it.  friends are good for that too, but in the long run...having someone that loves you and needs you is just so important.  ive been depressing myself lately by reading the note book, bridges of maddison county, message in a bottle.  not very good books to read when you're a single girl.. anyways back to work.  i love eveyone."

Yeah.  sleep..i need it.  its getting to the point where even if im trying to sleep next to paul, im wide awake.  Anyways. Im going to american idol try-outs next week in orlando.  i have no singing talent what so ever, but one of my best friends is the most talented singer out there, so im going for moral support.  I havent talked to nick in a long ass time, im miss him.  I wish i could have seen him before he moved, but alas...life isnt perfect. nick, if you read this..sorry bout your toe..ech..yep.  im looking for a house to buy.  its driving me crazy living with my mom and my sister.  Her son its just constintly screaming and when hes not, that means hes sleeping and in that case, if i sneeze then ""i'll wake the baby""  i miss paul.  hes got his whole band thing right now.  and im cool with that, its just that i never get to see him.  I feel like we have a long distance relationship now.  jesus...now im just going to make myself depressed.  anywho-im going to lay down and shut my eyes, if that dosent work..im waking up trista and making her give me cupcakes.  goodnight all."

She described the type of person she can see me with.  and shes right.  sometimes i get so confused in my life.  I dont know like sometimes i want a guy like paul.  hes strong and funny and just well...kinda like a rebel. i mean hes got the whole rock star thing going for him but other times i think to my self..what if...what if hes not the one for me.  i hate being unsure of things al the time.  im never sure if what i want is good for me or not.  i miss hanging out with my friends.  it seems like if im not at work im at home getting ready for work or getting ready to go to sleep.  i just dont know any more. i've got alot of thinking to do. hmm...i love everyone."

He also said it was caused by too much sex.  That was a little embaressing.  Not only am i telling him how my pee hurts hes telling me i need to lay off the boom boom.  Oh my, it sucks though.

Paul was supposed to be home tongiht from the wedding in Miami, and he hasnt called me since the day he left.  most likely he got home late and went to bed.  in my mind i like to make these really fucking horrible scenarios. like i think that he cheated on me with his exgirl friend while he was up there and either hes not comming back or hes going to dump me when i see him.  yay.  i love my mind.  and its funny.  if i do see him tomarrow, i wont mention the fact that i was so scared of this.  im so afraid of letting them know how much i care about them.  everyday i worry about my freinds.  im so scared that one of them is going to get hurt.  and im so afraid of telling even my best friend how much i love her, and how i hope everything in her life is well.  why is that? why am i so afraid of telling people that i care about them?  like in letters...i can say anything.  i can tell people exactly how i feel.  but speaking it to them is another story. eh, oh well...just a little mystery in my life that i might never figure out.  i love everyone. <~~SEE>????"

"event","Some times rhe world just pisses me off.  I dont understand anyone anymore.  Like, me for example.  I try so hard to be a happy person and usually im just as happy as i seem, but for some reason or another, it angers people.  Tonight at work i was in a really good mood, and im always sort of a goofball, so im making up the pastery case and im talking non-sence. And dan was making fun of me for being happy.  And then Paul started laughing right along with him.  I really wish i had a guy who would stand up for me.  Its like that song says ""when a man loves a woman, he turn his back on his best friend if he put her down""  all im asking for is when people make fun of me, DONT FUCKING SIT THERE AND LAUGH!!!  everytime someone told me he wasnt worth the time and then hes just a scum-bag, i stood up for him, and now my boss likes him and people who wouldnt even think twice about him love him to death. i just hate the fact that if im in a good mood theres always someone there with a rude fucking commment.  And god forbid i be sad or something, then oh..katies depressed...shes boring.  MAybe im just here as a sort of punching bag.  There are probably 10 people in this world that i really trust.  the rest of them are the people im nice to, and try to find bull shit to talk to them about.  GOD! if no one wants me to be in a good mood, and no one wants me to be ad, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT FROM ME!?!?!?!   i swear, i try to hard to be everything to everyone.  Well, thats gonna stop.  If im in a god-damn good mood, im gonna be silly and smile, this world needs more smiles.  i just really wish sometimes that things would go smoothly for me, but no.  i have a hard time with everything.  right now my boyfriends probably fucking some 14 year old little girl (god knows he has them crawling all over him)  i want love.  I want to feel that deep passion from someone like that guy in the song mentioned above did.  when a man loves a woman, i want to marry the guy that wrote that damn song.  no, i jsut want a protector.  Someone who will wake up in the middle of the night and get out of bed if i hear a strange sound.  someone who hold me really close durring the scary part of the movie.  soemone who would remeber the names of my cats.  i just want love.  ii dont know if paul feels the same way. i really wish i could tell him all these things...but me? katie? tell someone how i really feel? not possible.  sigh.  i love everyone"

I went to Paul's after work tonight.  Im so fucking scared.  Im so afraid hes going to hurt me.  I feel so stupid for letting myself like someone again.  Hes a really great guy, but im just so nervous.  He tells me all the time that he wont hurt me, but god knows ive heard that one before.  Me and my mom got into a fight today.  She doesnt like Paul, and then she goes on telling me all this shit like, im going to listen.  My mom's always been one of my best friends. I just wish shed let me make my own choices.  If i get hurrt again, i get hrt again and for some reason or another it was ment to happen.  
   Fuck my tonsils.  My right toncil is so swollen and has white dots on it, its so gross.  I had rich look at it earlier and he said i should go to a doctor.  I think im going to do just that.  Good ol doctors.  I hope he just takes them out.  perfect timing to get toncilitus.  4 days till my b-day.  If i get my toncils taken out on my b-day ide hope the nurses and doctors would come into my room and celebrate it with me.  Aww~! that would be so fun!  only, i couldnt say thank you to them, because my throat would hurt too bad.  Oh well, it would be cool if they were like ""hey katie, on behalf of you being a great patient we decided to let you keep your toncils"" eww! they would be in a jar of formaldihide!  
   SIGH! Well, one of my most bestest friends is going to michigan for a week, which is very sad.  Its gonna suck not having her here.  I get to play with her ferrits while shes gone though!  I have to be at school in 4 nd a half hours!  I need more sleep.  Goodnight loves! I love everyone!"

I had this dream that it was halloween and me and my sister were so busy that we didn't get to go trick-or-treating, and i felt really bad, like to the point were i was almost crying. So, i turned on the news and it had the last house that was giving out candy on there, so i tried going there, but it was too late.  So then it switched over to this halloween party.  Me, Kristen and Jenny Lee were there and we we playing this karma game...So weird.  We started out the game by kissing our partner, and suddenly nick was there, and i really wanted him to be my partner so i ran up and kissed him...(it was really good too.) wow...heh...anyways..moving right along...then it switched over to another halloween party over at jeremiahs house.  And he kept trying to like..touch me...and i knew it was bad, so i told him i was going to sleep.  Then i went into his room and took a nap. And then i was in this garden thing and there was this albino-looking guy.  I felt so bad for him (not because he was albino) i just felt really bad.  So i sat next to him and he started crying and he put his head on my shoulder and he explained to me that he just wished the world could be like nicer.  Not just to him, but just nicer in general.  Then i woke up and i was back in jerimiahs bed.  i got out and i walked into the kitchen and i looked outside and it was dark, but everyone was calling my name.  So i wnet outside and Niki jeremiah and someone else was there.  Then jeremiah comes up to me and starts trying to touch me again.  Then Nick suddenly appeared.  So i ran up to him and he carried me into his car.  And then i felt like more safe then ever.  oh my gosh. ok, i had to write that down or else i knew ide forget.  i love everyone."

Who, in my opinion, is the best guy ever.  I talked to him tonight.  Well, me and jenny lee did.  He's so good.  He makes me laugh, seriously like no one else.  I don't know.  There's just something about him that i can't understand.  i think there's a lot more to him then he leads on.  i miss him.  why am i so stupid. oi. ive probably messed everything up though.  i knew it.  the minute i find a ""good"" guy i go and treat him like shit.  grrr.  i shouldn't be aloud to talk to people.  oh christ..i think IM going to have James brown rape Jeremiah up the ass.  he was being such a dickehead today.  he kept making fun of me,, i mean, yes. i know IM very accident prone, but he just kept making fun of me everytime i dropped something so finally i just stopped like talking to him.  and then he acts all worried.  GOD!! he's such a...a...jerk.  i mean, i had tears in my eyes.  i could have used  a hug...big time.  Bobby came in and hugged me...so did Stacie.  so that's good.  i could have used another one though.  *sigh*  I HAVE THE DAY OFF TOMORROW!!!!! IM so excited!!

Or if you would like to rape Jeremiah...you should also come.  HAHAHA!!! If I spelled it cum...that would have been really funny.  I miss meaghan.  I haven't hung out with her in a while.  I really want to have a huge hug-fest, do you know how sweet that would be???  Hugs Across America. (HAA)  That's what I'll call it.  Yeah.  I miss him.  Baa humbug.  I love everyone."

"event","I go through all this
before you wake up
so I can feel happier
to be safe up here with you

it's real early morning
no-one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
on their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks

when it lands
will my eyes
be closed or open?

Bjork is so weird.  i worked again today...and went to class.  i dont think i belong here sometimes.  i just really want to get out of here.  i feel like im stuck.  like, the world around me is never gonna change.  maybe its up to me to make the changes.  *sigh*  if only i could change the past.

"event","yay.  today was ok, regina (pronounced like vagina) called in half an hour before her shift today.  i was so upset, but shes pregnant...o i guess i have to take pitty.  Anyways, Dan (god bless him) came in and helped us close.  you know, dan is one of those people i just dont understand.  he is such a good person..i just can't see him staying mad at someone.  yeah, so i feel bad for trying to call stacie in.  i always feel bad calling people on their day off.  anyways..im so confused.  i talked to nick tonight.  he has got to be one of the funniest guy  i've ever met.  me and him tried to convince jenny lee not to talk to her ex.  jenny lee is so great.  jen, if youre reading this, from what i hear about this guy, you can do alot better.  i hear the guys over a pretzel time are real cool. ha.  man...i need to be psychic.  that would be so sweet. i wouldnt have fun seeing movies though. or reading books.  never mind.  im glad im not a psychic.  man im rediculous.  I have the day off tomarrow.  im so excited.  however i do have  to got to the eye doctor.  gots to get me some glasses.  okies..well...if anyone wants to give me advice on what i should do with my life right now (this goes for you, too ms. cleo) post something...i love everyone.  i have a lot of typos."

"event","today was...good. i got called into work cause trista didnt show up.  ha.  yeah, to think god would actually let me have a saturday off.  but, it was ok...jeremiah put in his two weeks. i just dont get it.  me and him used to be such good friends, and now hes a total dick to me.  oh well.  im so ready to get out of here. im thinking of taking a road trip to Atlanta in november. that is if barnies will let me off the leash.  i love everyone.  people are so great!  just seeing people smile is so much fun. i hate when i make people frown.  if i ever made someone cry, i think ide have to shoot myself. or melt. my friend phil had a good idea about people.  we should have a special light for everyone we know and so if you ever wanted to find them, you could look into the sky and see where they were.  it might be difficult durring the day time...but i bet it would be very convienient.  blech. i love people."

"event","Im so grumpy. ive just been grumpy all day. i dont like to complain, but hey!!! i never do, so let me begin...gee...ok, i feel like the biggest shit whore in the world for breaking up with nick last night. hes such a freakin good guy. why cant i just move on with my life? i wish i could just forget about everything that had happend in the past and move on with everything, but of course not. emotions allways take over. he said he wasnt mad, but i know i hurt him. some one should step on my face. anyways moving right along, my job sucks. jeremiah is so fucking power happy it makes me sick. all hes concerned about is writing people up. he actually wanted me to write up dan for the stupidest fucking thing in the world..and im sorry but im not retarted. if dan hits a customer in the face and drinks their coffee, yeah, i'll probobly write him up for that. well, knowing me, i probobly wouldnt. everyones always telling me im a push over. i need to grow some balls. man...i wish someone was here right now. im so emo today. all i want to do is have a giant hug fest. i dont know about you, but i think hugs cure everything. unless youve got scabies. then you just need ointment. :( if you are one of the many that i told of this thang, you should come to my work on sunday and hug me...even if im smiling, im probobly still grumpy..i need to work with stacie more...she makes me so happy when im at work. oi...annoying is the sound of your phone ringing at 3:30 in the morning..."

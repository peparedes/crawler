"event","SOOOOOOOOO where to begin? My birthday is in 2 weeks, and im so pumped! FYI im like a little kid when it comes to my birthday, and i always have been. Once Feb 13th comes around, I start to realize its so soon, and i get so excited! I realized that I was very childish about my birthday when my 7 year old cousin said to me last week ""MY BIRTHDAY IS IN 3 WEEKS"", and I replied with ""MINE TOOO"", yes his is 2 days before mine, but he is 7 and i am going to be 20 and wow there is a big difference there.  

Dave tour dates were released, and even my mom is excited. She gets so pumped over my brother and I happy about dave because its like our life in the summer.  So basically, 6/18 and 19 i'll be in hartford, 7/1 and 2 i'll of course be rocking the best show he'll preform in saratoga, 7/21 for pj's birthday in Cininnati, and 7/21 in darien Lake.  I'll hopefully also be seeing Dave at Bonnaroo 6/12 which is MMMMAZING!  My brother and I of course will get inside seats for saratoga shows, and I dont know who im going to take.  Last year I went with momo, the year before i went one night with derek, and the other night with Lisa.  I would Love to go with Trevor, but it all depends on how things are between us, i mean as of now they aren't anything.  They were PERFECT, but I was really upset last week, and I haven't talked to him since. 

Since i went to school after we started talking, Ive seen him everyweekend except one.  I went home twice or three times, he visited me twice.  WE talked everynight on the phone, like we acted like we were something really great, really open but then again relaxed due to the distance in our relationship.  i was quite upset to find out that he was still talking to that nikki bitch he told me he wasn't talking to anymore, and he told me I was the only girl in his life.  Not only did he tell me I was the only girl he cared about, he told me allllll this stuff, and I am very hessitant to believe if it was true because thigns were so great.  The one thing i really didn't have to question was the fact that he liked me because I knew he did, i knew that he wouldnt just come out to visit me twice, cancel plans with friends because i was coming home, and do everything for me, take me out to lunch, clean my apt when im at work, make me cds, oh the list goes on and on and on believe me. He did everything in his nature that proved to me that he cared for me, so i believe that he did care for me, I just dont understand why he had to talk to another girl and me at the same time....but then again I talk to other guys so I guess its ok right? But I dont tell them ANYTHING of what i told trevor or close to it, it just hurts alot i guess. We werent going out, he was allowed to do what he wanted.  We ended things on the basis of wanting things to be like nothing happened, ok with everything, understanding of eachother, no hard feelings.  Of course it didn't end ok though because here I am totally crushed because we haven't talkd in a week, he doesn't call me anymore, and we haven't talked since, so Obviousally nothing went back to normal.  

I was so mad at trevor.  I hate him so much because HES SO AMAZING, hes such a great guy, hes so fucking great.  IM ok though, Im happy, thats all that matters.  I realized that I really dont think that any type of relationship could have honestly worked out right now, and that Obviousally my feelings aren't going to go away for him because i really do strongly care for this guy, and I do think about him everyday, and IM not mad anymore, I was upset for like 2 days, and Im not upset anymore.  Upset that we can't be together? Nope, because its just out of my control and logically not possible, so being mad and staying mad-- stupid.  I can't wait to go home and hang out with him. i hope i get to. 

Tage Mo and Jodi are coming out for my birthday, and Mollie is having a birthday party for me,a nd im excited for that.  Im excited to se tage i haven't seen him in a loooong time! OK weeeeeeeeeelllll bye

"event","So that is a recap of what has been going on in my love life, this amazing guy who has been treating me great.  Even though i am back at school I have seen him twice, I have gone home and he has visited me, and he told me this morning he wants to visit me next weekend which is amazing news.  I guess it was amazing news untill Maura called me tonight to tell me that she saw trevor at the movies with another girl kissing.  When trevor told me about his day he included that he had seen a movie so i couldn't resist asking who he saw a movie with.  He told me his sister, but did Maura lie to me and tell me that she saw him kissing someone because she does not want me to be with him? Of course not.  She talked to john, trevors bestfriend and the girls name is britney and its the truth.  

Trevor and I aren't dating, but what am I to think about something like this?? He was obviousally being extremely sneaky by lying to me, twice.  

I dont know where my heart is right now....

in another drink for now"

"event","So i guess I haven't updated in a reallll long time.  I wrote this about a month ago *jan 7th, 2005* when i couldn't update to online:

Lately i've gotten myself thinking about relationships.  We all find ourselfs in them one way or another, whether a realtionship consists of a bond as strong as a life long friendship, or in a intimiate relationship, where some people have many more partners than another does, based on morals and other characteristics.  I think it is impossible to break down relationships and what they really mean because they are different in every scenario.  A relationship can be someone you trust for the life of you, or it can be something you just brush aside, relate with someone as an aquantance.  

I have been dating Tage for a long time, over a year, and well, we aren't in the best stage of any relationship.  In the last week, I have looked at my relationships with people, and other peoples relationships and realized, learned and determinded I want to be on my better half.  

I Have known this guy Trevor for quite some time and well quite frankly, I have always felt this amazing connection with him from the first day we met.  I dont know if it was because he senerated me with his brilliant guitar skills, or if I am attracted to his cute little laugh, and best personality, but there is something within the boy that sparks an interest in me.  I can't help but to smile when I am with him, and I feel extremely comfortable saying anything, and well just being myself.  We went to highschool together, but never really hung out in highschool, and lately we've been hanging out alot.  The other night we just hung out the two of us at his house, and we had the most amazing time, went to the bar, sat at a table and talked for hours about everything and anything, and then went back to his house and just layed together.  Since that night, this boy has been on my mind 24/7.  Its not because he is the most amazing looking person, because he isn't, it isn't because he says the right things, or has the best clothes or shoes or car or anything that alot of girls are attracted to, (im not saying that he isn't of these things though).  Hes been on my mind because of the chemistry we had, the true genuine person he showed himself to be.  When i arrived at his house he asked to take my coat, got me a glass for my coat, and just made sure i was completely comfortable.  The whole night, i was infront of him, as he opened doors for me, held his hand out for me, everystep and movement shows that his mother raised him well.  When I woke up in the morning, he woke up and went downstairs, but tucked meinto bed before he left the room.  These are just some of the few of the most amazing things that this guy did for me.  He called me later that night to tell me that he had band practice he forgot about and he couldn't make a movie that we had drunkly talked about the night before.  I hung out with him the night later, and we had another really great night, hanging outw ith some mutual friends, and having a good time.  Just everything about his personality is great, and it makes me realize what a true person is all about.  We layed in bed this morning and we just talked, and i then brought him to his car.  He had quite a few plans for the weekend, including going away with his friends, even though he wanted to stay in town to hang out with me. He promised his friend seth that he would go.  Of course, another quality that is perfect, he dosent ditch out on his friends for a girl, because its the right thing to do......

Like Melissa had done to me on my birthday, when we went to Toronto, she went to NYC with her boyfriend who she sees everyday.  I was so unbelieveably upset, and I to this day just realize you can't ditch out on friends for things that aren't as important because they will not forget, it shows what type of person you are when you do that, it puts a dent in your character, and that dent isnt forgiveable, or able to knock out and cover up.  Ive been looking at Jody and Melissa's relationship lately, and well, I dont know where to start, but all i know is that trust in a relationship is probally the most important thing, and when its not there, nothing can last, nothing can be complete with out trust.  Melissa has lied to jodi a few times in the last week, which have turned into bigger lies,a nd They have just been fighting, more and more....The insecurties within them have led them to become controlling of eachother to the point where they both need toknow eactly what the other is doing at all times and who is present in their lives.  I can't take it because Melissa and I just used to be able to do anything, and now Its like she has a big lock on her life.  

I look at the way I am in a relationship, extremely controlling like Jodi and melissa are becoming to eachother.  I hate to see it in them, but I realize that I am the same way in relationships with friends, with boyfriends, and with family.  I am normally needed to be reassured that i am loved, but if there is trust, there is no need, and Trust starts with yourself.  One can only trust their partner in a realtionship when they are able to be trusted, and when the two comprise is met, then trust is met.....But when trust is broken, its really hard to repair on either end.....Once it is, the relationship almost starts over because the trust starts to grow again like a flower.  Trust is extremely important in a relationship, but in order to trust, a person needs to let their guard down, allowing the possibility of being hurt the other. You only have to let it down a little, trust will grow from there and once trust grows, ones guard can be let down more and more, its something that goes together.  

Right now all i can think of is laying with trevor in bed, hanging out with him, but I think it will be even that more special when I do get to see him on sunday, because it will be all that much more amazing."

"event","I miss brendan, alot. Yesterday was his birthday, and he would have turned 21.  I remember his birthday when we were dating, it was really special.  Anyway, His parents haad a burial ceremony for him.  He was cremated, and then last october 28, someof his ashes were spread in the ocean, on the shore of capecod.  This year, the rest of his ashes were buried in a cemetary in Albany. I was unable to make the ceremony but Maura, his sister told me all about the day.  His parents gave a ceremony where they shared his life, and positive thoughts.  His mother made a speech aboutthe first day he was born, saying that he didn't cry when the nurse gave him to his mother to feed, and that he just stared at her with the most magical, big eyes.  She told everyone how she knew that brendan was going to be a special child, and that he was.  His father gave a speech,buthe was falling apart.  He talked about how he gave brendan his first bath, and first beer,a fatherly/son relationship that he now misses.  Alot of his Geneseo friends were there, and some good close friends from homw also.  They day was beautiful, and he is burried in the back corner of the cemetary.  Thanksgiving, im going to go visit,and just sit there for hours, no matter what the weather brings. I think it will be really good for myself. 

RIP brendan michael cullen 10/28/83 to 1/8/03- i Love You"

When im upset at school my roommates and friends just leave me alone, and let me work this out on my own, where clearly i need a hug, a friend, something.... Its like everyone can laugh and joke, but when it comes down to real life, no one can take it.  If i was home, my girls would listen to whats wrong, give advise, and I wouldn't have to go to them for it, they would be right there for me...here its so different. I am alone, no one understands, or trys to..... It makes me more upset when something small happens, and I dont have anyone here to help me back up on my feet....what would i do if something big happened? I mean....its impossible"

I see him for a week or weekend every 2 months about... That is so hard because even though i speak to him EVERY NIGHT, when i do see him, i have to realize we aren't on the phone, and sometimes im lost for words *yeah what?* In the same sense, I love how comphy with him, I can do anything and say anything and he just gives me so much love."

"event","After reading Caras journal today, I realized oh shit my dreams are so crazy. I haven't slept well lately. Its all the drinking i've been doing, mixed with all the work, and missing Tage and the rethinking WhAT THE FUCK AM I DOING? 

Cara and I always would be like WOOAH get this dream I had, and of course hers were ALWAYS better than mine, its the creative mind, and probally all that pot she smokes, hahahahhaa, but I have some messed up dreams, I swear. Lately, i've been looking up my dreams, and what they symbolize, in my dream dictionarys. I have two dictionarys, they are really good books, and have a lot of good information about sleep, dreams, and psychology.  

Last night I had a dream that Quinn and I were headed to Buffalo on a train.  I just remember having a bunch of random people on this train, and Quinn was on the frontof the train, but the train had like b eds to sleep in, and Quinn asked me to cuddle with him. I also remember the train stopping a few times,becuase some people had missed the train. I also remember having to get up a few times to go to get some food and stuff to eat. When i looked in my Dictionary, it said that Train Journey is 

""The aspect of our journey though life which has connection iwth other people and has predetermined end, limiting our individual will, especially where there is a feeling of 'departing' or 'time of depature'; the train of though or experiences which carry us though life. Missing a train is feeling left out of opportunity sense of inadequacy held back by ones own hesitations, hidden desire to avoid change or to make one's individual journey. ""

The whole situation just reminds me of my current situation with Tage. I mean, this dictionary could be complete bogus for all I know, like horoscopes, but Seriousally, I do feel like I am missing out on so much through our relationship.  I feel like I am being held back from so much, That I dont have a ""real"" relationship, and that all I do is look toward the future with him.  Its so hard to explain on this thing. 

I spoke with Tage this morning. I'vebeen waiting for months to speak with him. After wards I was SOOOO HAPPY!, but at the time, i was like Sooo what should I talk to himabout next!? He had to keep telling me to speak up, I basically was YELLING into my phone, and it was an uncomfortable situation. He really didn't have much to say except for that he was coming home, that he missed me, loved me and that he got drunk on friday night and loved my scrap book. Im completely over reacting. We had a good talk. I just can't wait to see him I suppose. I just wish there wasn't that awkwardness of having to catch him up with my life for the last 3 months when I talk to him or see him. It really sucks, and I hate it and HONESTLY, IM NOT HAPPYYYYYY. I love TAGE with all my heart, and I dont think I could let him go, but I could say right now, Im not going to break things off because I cant, but IM SOOO HAPPY HES COMING HOME because I dont know how much longer of this I could handle. 

He told me that he is only going to deployment once more in his WHOLE navy career, which is next march, till september (Summer time again), and he might take like week type things, but he will not go on any long deployments again, which is GREAT. WeLL that is what is planned. This trip wasn't even planned, and he had to go out. Im hoping that he sticks to that. If thats true, I think things could work out, we could see eachother ALOT more, I am spending Xmas break with hhim, we talked about it this morning. Like I said, our talk wasn't as bad as I made it out to be....Im just a spoiled brat, and I'll admit it, and I dont like it when hes not around for me I suppose....

Untill I write again.....

I swear...this is like my dramatic story about tage or something"

Ok, i am still skinny, i am not some oversized monster, but seriousally, in the last 2 months i have gained like 5 to 7 lbs. Even rider said i gained a few pounds since he last saw me 3 weeks ago. I have been sitting around on my ass all summer eating EVERYTHING in sight, and saying I WILL WORK IT OFF TOMMORROW, which never comes. Crew is going to kick me in the ass when the season starts. I need to get back into shape and back into my good eating habits, even though i have eaten well today, I miss my salads, andgood food, but Lately, stuffing myself with whatever is in my face just easier. 

Today is my brothers bday. I talked to him, he is in New Jersey seeing Dave. He is stalking dave this summer. I can't even count how many concerts he has been to already. Dave is slowly moving down the southern east coast though, and farther from us, and He will miss him. Oh well, Hes gotta be daved out by NOW! HAHAHA....OK SO MAYBE THATS IMPOSSIBLE. esp for him. 

Im going to buffalo tmw to visit Cilla for her bday. IM going with linds, and meetin gjenna and rach there. IM so excited to meet up with my girls. UGH! i love them! We are going to head to canada for the night, and party up there after a nice dinner and hitting up a strip club! Im def going to have to buy cilla a lap dance, and take LOTS of pics! its goiing to be a fun fun time! It sucks that I have to work on friday, but oh well....It will still be a goood time."

Work was crazy tonight. I am actually amazed by how unorgazined a pizza place can be. Sal, the owner, should have someone run the front and the phones, while the waitress' handle the floor, but instead he has the waitress' run all over the place doing everything, and its just a big mess in my opinion. I had 5 tables tonight all at the same time, recieving salads, bread, drinks, dinners, and of course my wonderful smile, while i was also incharge of answering the phones, and taking care of the front. I felt bad because roxy was basically left to handle the front and her 2 tables by herself while me and andrea ran around in circles. Its kind of unorganized, but I make good money there, and my 5 years of waitressing at the 333 has paid off let me tell you.

Tage emailed me and told me that he will be home for his Birthday, which is less than a month away, August 13th. That is very exciting because I dont know how much longer i can take of this summer with out him. Oh man! I am sick of hearing from him every few days, and i haven't even recieved a phone call. I know hes busy. I completely understand, it is just so hard having him so far away, and me here. Aug 13 is closer than i realize. I mean its the 18th already. Im excited for him to come home but also excited to go back to school. When he takes leave, I have so many things for us to do, i can't even sit and write them all out. 

Rach and I have been going through I HATE LIFE AT HOME talks lately. Haha its really funny. We've decided that next summer we are going to stay in the Buffalo area instead of coming back to Albany, or in her case, York, and we will get an apartment together and take a class and work or SOMETHING! If I do get a house with the girls it will be a year lease anyway and I will be able to live there during the summer. OHHH that will be alot of fun decorating and what not. 

I fought with mike today for a while. I feel bad. He feels that he will never live up to what Tage is. I didn'tknow what to say but, NO ONE WILL. Hahahaha....its the truth. Theres something more than just a relationship between the two of us. I mean i absolutely HATE dating a guy in the Navy, but there is so much more depth to what the two of us have to keep it going, and It makes every last bit worth it. I wouldn't put myself through this if there wasn't something about tage that i would what to be with him long term. I could see myself with for the rest of my life. I mean obviousally, with these deployments, they suck!!!!! I can't wait till he comes home and takes me shopping! Well i can't wait till he comes home and holds me in his arms let alone anything else, but the shopping aspect is sweet too."

Missing Tage more than ever. I feel like he is just never going to come home. He knows what is going on in my life because i write him every detail of my life, and what is going on in it, but his emails are breif, and last nights didn't even include an ""I LOVE YOU"" Which really upset me- it was an ""Love you, Tage"" and how he signed it, type of deal. Its not that I dont want to wait, its just that I wish i had more communication with him, and that I could see him. This summer is just going by so slow, and his last email he told me that he might not be home for the end of the summer which makes me think that its my fault, even though its not. Our relationship is just so messed up because its perfect when we are together and everything but when we are apart I just miss him so much, but who wouldn't miss someone for months at a time, especially when the only contact they have with them is an email maybe everyother day that is very unemotional. I understand that he can not tell me alot about what is going on in his life due to military rules, but it would be nice to just know! I sent him pictures of graduation last night. he wrote back and said he loved them and that makes me happy. He wrote that he loved me wearing his necklace. I wear his heart around my neck, always. 

Jodi's apartment was a first time adventure, and a dissapointment in general. It makes me think, Oh my god, my bestfriend is dating this? First off his roommate John and his girlfriend Karen Walenta are hudge Cokeheads and were high off their asses just making a fool out of themselves. Also other people who were there were kristi plog, james his other roommate,and jame's girlfriend, and joe donelly and his girlfriend. Kristi plog rudely asked me what type of occassion I would wear a DRESS LIKE THAT FOR? I was like ummm well it was bchs graduation tonight and i haven't changed yet, and she goes ohhh..well was the ceremony boring?? IM like youre so fucking rude..i didn't say that but i wanted to. Then later on shes like SOOO TRISHA YOU DONT SMOKE? im like NO...She just bothered me. Than James is talking to Jodi about doing coke the night before he was like looking at him stunned and trying to like get him to change the subject like right there and then because I was there and he knows I hate that shit. So later in the car when Melissa was praising Jodi for not doing coke like his rooomates...So i told her what james and jodi had discussed earlier when she was not around. I Think thats fucked up. I Just hate that trash, and I dont want to associate with it. Melissa works with, and has started to hang around with a bunch of people I dont like to be apart of b/c trash is what they are. Hard Drug using, fucked up kids who dropped out of highschool and have no class what no ever, just sit around gambling, drinking and what not. That is not my type of social gathering, or my type of crowd to hang around in."

Tonight I am most likly going to go up to Kev's house and hang out with him and a few friends by the pool but there are going to be DWI blankets so I can't drink too much and drive home. Hopefully Momo will join, or I will see her for a bit.

April just called me and said anna might be going to Jillians which we dcan't get into due to a lack of the whole ID situation, so she wanted to know what was up, and I told her I wasn't sure but I invited her to Kev's, I hope he doesn't mind. I also talked to Amy tonight, hopefully we can get together and do something soon. 

well I am missing my Navy man more than Ever....Hope I can see him soonn.....only 8more weeks now! <3"

"event","I guess I am going to try this thing out again.... I mean beautiful Cara did give me this name to use, and since she is in love with her journal I must use mine~! I tried once before and I wrote twice? So here it goes....

My summer is going alright I suppose. Babysitting is seriousally a joke. I sit around wiht a 10 year old who is just a serious brat, and her adorable apriocot colored poodle and watch movies and watch Television ALL DAY LONG. I feel like it is just a waste of time. I have been reading The Di Vinci Code, which is pretty interesting so far, and watching alot of old sitcoms and shows from my past like Saved by the Bell and old episodes of Friends.  I know that when it gets later into the summer I will be able to take Gianna swimming and what not, but for now I am just so bored all day long. 

I am really happy that Summer school is over with though. It was a 3 week history class that was just 3 hours a day, everyday, and was about 8 hours of work a night. It was soooo much reading, about 150 pages of text book reading a night. I mean how can you fit a whole semester of work and reading into 3 weeks? It was ridiclious. I ended up doing well in the class and all, but seriousally, I worked my Ass for my grade, and I cramed alot of info for the tests. I remember names, and what happened, but i dont remember when it happened and who did what....im confused... I just didn't retain alot of the information that is all....But I guess im just glad its over and done with.

I miss Tage so much. I have recieved emails from him almost every day, or every other day, but I write to him like 4-5 times a day, and he tells me to write to him as much as possible. It really sucks having him away. When he was in Virginia I could talk to him on the phone every night, and even though I could not see him, It was comforting to be able to speak to my baby when needed. Now that he is on a boat headed to Iraq, he is gone for 2.5 months, and I can't speak to him on the phone, and the most I really get out of the emails are Paragraphs saying ""I love you, I miss you, I am tired, I will write soon"", types of things...I can't explain us. I am so in love with him its crazy. When I think about him my heart spins. I have honestly never felt so safe about a guy before, even though I am so far away from him and I will not see him as much as I want to, I dont want to be with anyone else, or think about another guy, and I know the same goes for him. He is the only one I dream and think about, and the only one I can picture spending the rest of my life with...so While the long distance sucks, it is worth every minute and every tear of pain because HE is so worth it. 

At school I wasn't my real self when it came to guys because I was just all around and stuff like that but Tage came into my life and everything was real, everything was amazing, and everything was what is supposed to be...and what i have always dreamed about....

When He was home last, and then the weekend after that when i visited him in Virginia, those were the most amazing times we have spent together, in my opinion because we hadnt been together in 3 months, and a rough 3 months they were...and I just had longed for everything...the fun we had and the emotional ties. Everything was back to normal. Our friendship, our love, our everything. Rawrrrrrrr

I made a really awesome scrapbook that took forever for tage. I am going to send it to him along with a couple magazines, a bunch of food and some more pictures that aren't in the scrap book. I wonder how long it will take to get to him on the ship.

SOOOO basically in the most part...I was just Catching up my feelings of everything.  Having tage in the navy is hard, but he will be home in 2 months from now, and everything will be ok. Everything will always work out. Love will find a way right?"

"event","Soooooo this past wednesday night when I was talking to Jim he told me that one of the Baskteball players had passed away. He told me he wasn't sure of details and that he just heard it around campus because everyone was talking about it. I am home for a long weekend, and of course didnt hear anything because I left early afternoon. 

These last two days there has been RIP Richard Jones in everyones profiles, and everywhere. I guess it may be the respectable thing to do if you knew him or not. I did not know him what so ever, but many people feel that even if they did know him that is the respectable thing to do. But it just reminds me of Brendan. 

So many people who did not know him, put him in their profile. Still to this day, so many people would say they were better friends wiht them then they really were. People write on his website how much they miss him, and how much he meant to them. I dont mean to sound selfish but these are people who I never heard of Brendan talk about, or they are people that I heard Brendan talk down about, and say he disliked. It really bothers me to read peoples passages ont he website about everyso often saying they dont know what they do with out him, and so on. I just think back to that one night when Brendan said all that stuff about who his true friends were. Up untill Brendan passed away I knew who he hung out with. It just really bothers me I guess because its like they are substiuting him in their life for something else. They are upset whit something else in their life, and they ease the pain wiht blaming it on Brendans death. I know that sometimes I do that, and I tell myself I CANT, and I need to get over it. I know his sister does that ALOT, or used to. I haven't spoken with her in a while. 

Why are people so obsessed wiht death? Seriousally? Why do they obsess over someone who has died and then worship them more now that they are gone than they did when they were here living. 

Doesn't it make sense that people should love their close family and friends to full capacity as much as they can all the time, never less then that while they are here, then to obesses over it when they are gone. I understand the greivence process I went through it for a long time after brendan died. I am not talking about the grevience process wen im talking about obession. I am talking about people who obsess over those who have passed away saying that they wished they had known them better, or things like that. I seriousally can't stand it. I think its respectful to go to a funeral, burry, and give respect to the dead. I think especially to family and loved ones at the time of mourning, and if you are a loved one it is also very important to, but why are we obsessed with those who pass away to the point where people lead themselfs to believe they were better friends with that person? or wish they had been? or how bout the famous....""THEY HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE DRAMATICALLY?"" How can someone you dont know change your life? 

TALK IS CHEEP AND I HATE IT

Some people should have to pay to be able to talk. Seriousally. I mean sometimes the things I say are beyond stupid. NO they are straight up dumb. I think im like dyslexic because I have a hard time forming my speech, and i switch things around, in my head, esp when i read numbers and stuff. But in the end.... talk is cheep, and people beleive way too much. That is why i keep my guard up AT ALL TIMES....
believe no one...trust no one...bUT YOURSELF that is"

"event","just got off the phone with tage. We talked for 2 and a half hours about the usual nothing, cars, and what not.  He told me that his love for me was real love, he usually doesn't tell people he loves them unless its true, and he loves me.  When he loves, its extreme and when he hates its extreme.  That makes my heart happy."

"event","So i have been waiting since the summer for this day, Thanksgiving when Tage has come hoooooommmmeeee! Not only that, but to see everyone, and to catch up on our lives as they were back like they used to be, the months before the college days. I have talked to tage on the phone for the last 2 months for hours on the phone.  I confessed that I had feelings for him to Melissa, because it was true.  Over the summer I did have feelings, but I keep them a secret because they would go no where but to a known broken heart, but those phone convos rekindeled alot of our past and our friendship.  Who talks to someone night after night for 2 hours a night, closing each convo with an ""I love You?"" We even told eachother we were goign to get married by 25, and planned out our kids, and all this stuff, to which I took seriousally, he, Im not sure.  I hinted my feelings to him over and over, and Late night drunken phone calls told him alot about the way i felt.  I think, No...im Sure that right before He came home he got scared about the thought of me and him because when he got home he didn't call me.  He called my bestfriend, but not me.  I just dont understand.  All those convos leaving me feeling loved and a sense of security make me turn around and realize they were just a lie? or fake? or what!? He was bored and had nothing else to do with his time but to tease me on the phone?  What else does he have to do with his life while hes in the Navy.  I can't win in relationships, Him coming home not calling me reminds me of brendan, he Used to do that to me EVERY TIME he came home. IM SCARRED with the fact of it.  He would come home and not call me, i'd wait around all night. AS i did tonight.  I think im going to go anti guys for awhile. I can't take it, i just cant take the fact of being hurt, which is being more and more often, and I am letting myself get hurt.  I just want to be loved, and its not going to happen. I just need to put guys out of my life and do well in school. Why did i ever think Tage was for me?  Well i still do, and Hes the type of guy i want to marry in my life, and Someday i'll find that guy but untill then im staying far away from guys, im scarred of them, they fuck with me too too much."

"event","I just got HOMEEEEEEE! Well after a 5 hour ride home from College I guess I deserve to go to sleep.  My bestfriend in the WHOLE world, Melissa, aka MOMO,  and we made cookies, and we talked about my favorite thing in the world, boys, and of course school. I caught her up on some things like what happened this morning, I talk to her for hours each day. I haven't seperated myself from her.  I haven't seperated myself from her because she can never be replaced. Our friendship is perfect. We dont fight, we are understanding, and I couldn't ask for a better friend then Melissa.  If I need something, she is always there for me in ALbany or Buffalo *where i go to School* and I can't seperate myself from that, and I never will. 

It feels good to have a break from school once and a while. I love school though, I am so excited for Thanksgiving. I can not wait.  Tage is coming home from the Navy and I have not seen him in 6 months, and I talk to him for hours each night on the phone.  I remember when he left, and the last time I saw him, and our last night together. We were bestfriends, but with something more then that.  We felt like there was something there, and we never acted on it.  We say I love you each night on the phone. We talk about getting married once we are out of schooling, and all that.  My friends play it off as we are joking, and I dont know if he is, but I would love to spend the rest of my life with Tage, and If not him, he is the standard Guy that I want to be with. He is different from the guys at school that I constantly flirt with and hookup with. He is special, and i care alot about him, and its something more then just puppy love.  But as of now, He is in Chicago, coming home for Thanksgiving weekend, and then again for 10 days for Xmas. I am overly excited, but after the time we spend together, I will go from Albany back to Buffalo, and he will go to Chicago, and this will continue for the next 4 years of our lives.  I need to realize these are the best times of my life.  I just always want to settle down early.  He tells me how alot of the guys there in the Navy are getting married.  I always wonder if he wants to marry now, or wait.  He tells me he wants to wait, but I just wonder what he thinks in his head.  I wonder if he wants to marry me or if he Just tells me that.  We have never dated nor sexually done anything, I am wondering wthat this weekend will bring.  If it doesn't bring anything I am ok with that. I love Tage with all my heart. He is my bestfriend, and he's done so much for me in my life. I can't forget all the memories we have shared, and how he has helped heal my heart when I have been hurt.  His sense of humor is just great. I compare everyone to him, and no one is as great, there is no comparasion."

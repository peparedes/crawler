"event","Welp as some of you may already know, my boyfriend Chris has been trying to gain custody of his daughter who is in the state of Missioui's custody.... well things have turned out for the greatest. Chris and is father will be flying out to Missiouri the night of Feb. 26th for a hearing on the 27th. There he will be handing the judge full custody papers, and seeing is how they have been ignoring him since day one and now he is there in person when they are about to give the child back to the proven unfit mother, we are garenteed that he will be granted full custody. Meaning when he and his dad fly home Wendesday night, theyt will have his daughter with them.

Looks like now when I go out I will have a little 3 year old girl right next to me. I am excited and also nervous because she has never met, seen or heard about Chris, so it is going to take time to get use to us and being here. I will let everyone know as soon as she gets her."

"event","OMG I have no idea what in the hell I am going to do! Chris is leaving for a week to Texas. Why to TX do you ask? Well lets see... to see a GIRL-FRIEND of his that he has known for years. Now your probably wondering why I am upset... hmmm lets see, because I do not trust her with him, and vies versa. I have heard him on the phone with her, and she is always wishing he was there to cuddle and wrap his arms around her. And the funny thing is I know he wont mind doing it and that is something I am not comfortable with. OH! and to top it all off, he didn't even ask if I wanted to see if I could join him! 


Maybe I am overreacting. Maybe I am being a worry wort. That I am not sure of. Welp yeah there is even more interesting news....

I am sure not a lot have heard but Chris is a FATHER! You've heard it right. Welp as of right now his daughter(who us 3 years old) is in state custody. Reasons why will take a long time to explain, but making it short, the court of Missouri saw that Meredeth(do not remember how she spells her name) was an unfit mother. Chris has been battling for over 4 months now trying to gain custody of his daughter. Has not been pretty because every time he has called them out there, they ignore him. Now here comes the kicker, we still have a chance. On Febuary 27th of this year there will be a hearing in Missouri about figurung out what the plan is for Chris'daughter. Well Chris and one of his grandmothers are flying out there, going in front of the judge and asking for his daughter. So by the end of next month things may change. 

Okay it is late, I am finally tired. Going to bed now"

My feet are killing me and it is very hard for me to even walk through my house without bursting into tears. I only work 8 hours a day, we get an hour lunch. Also I get two 15 minute breaks. Not to bad I get $8.45 per hour so it is more than I made at Legoland. But it is hard as hell to stay on my feet. Other than that I am doing fine, just going to be getting a bike to ride to and from work and also help my feet. Me and Chris are doing great and we are going to try and spend as much time together as possible. well it is getting late and my eye sight is getting blurry.

"event","Well I know I have not been updating every week like I wanted to, only things around here have gotten crazy. First good news is I got a job finally! It is at the local wal-mart. Its part time I am making $8.45 per hour which is not too bad, more than I was making at Lego, I am a floor associate in women's appearl meaning I am going to be cleaning and stocking all day. Only weird thing is are my hours 3:00pm to Midnight 5 days a week. Chris is either picking me up or we are buying mase! I mean it is only about a 10 min walk but this area is not that greatest. I have orientation tomorrow morning at 9:00am. 


Now that I will be working, first thing we are going to work on is getting me a car, me learning how to drive and getting my licence. Then we are going to look for our own place. That is going to be very interesting.

So far life with Chris has been okay, could be better. Right now we are having some bumps in the road but what relationship doesn't? Cool thing is during the last week of March my Grandma is coming out from AZ to visit my parents and she wants to meet Chris. That will really be interesting but I know my Grandma is going to like him.

Oh guess what!? I will be showing up to Legoland sometime within in next month! My renaissance guild master has a son who is turning 8 next month and for his birthday me and Chris want to take him, his dad and dad's girlfriend to Legoland! Hopefully I can get a hold of someone to see if they have 5 comp tickets that they would not giving away! Well not sure what else to say, I am tired had a busy weekend and I gotta be up early!"

Wont get into to much detail since I know whoever will read this might not want to hear all of it. I did something that I have not done in a long time that also included Chris. I am now starting to have a lot of doubts and I am worrying more than I should be. Okay I know I still have a lot of trust issues yet I know I truly do trust him, it is just something inside of me is bringing it all out and causing a lot of trouble. Friend that we just met this weekend has been staying with us cause she got kicked out of her other place for a really stupid reason and doesn't have anywhere to go has been hard for me because I am becoming very territorial and making her feel uncomfortable. I too have also been feeling uneasy and uncomfortable in my own room and home because she is her. To be fully honest I can not wait until we get her another place to stay. Now she is upset and only wanting one thing and I know for a fact it is not going to happen again. I do not like feeling like this and it is making mine and Chris' relationship suffer. Well I will get through it... hope everyone had a great beginning and hope to see some of you soon!!! (((Hugs & Kisses))"

Got to see all 6 kids, but spent most of my time with the younger 3 Jessica, Sophia and baby Aaron. Daltin, Dilian and Melissa were shocked to see me so my little surprised worked. Got to see the 2 older boys Daltin and Dilian play 2 basketball games and they are really good. Miss them all already, Dilian is wanting to come out to CA for a Ren faire and Heather will be coming to visit in about April or May next year. 

I feel like shit, I know I'm getting sick because the 3 younger ones all had colds and I know I got it.  Chris is Dad, and Rick are also feeling crapy and its one week from X-mas. Plus I found out, I am going to be watching one of Chris' lil cousin and getting $300+ a week, it;s going to help like no tomarrow.

Today, Chris is now 25 yrs old. **Giggles** He is now in his late 20s but I still love him. He had to work but tonight we're going to his traditional b-day movie, he picked Erogon (I know I didn't spell it right) Christmas we are going to Norwalk to spend time with his family and then the weekend after that we are going to see my parents and I can not wait to see Bella and how big she has gotten. Other than that we are doing fine and I am very happy to be home. Hope everyone has a MERRY CHIRSTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!"

"event","Hey I just got this e-mail on myspace from Mamma G from the guild of Tsuara about a
Man from the Laughing dragon guild ... THIS IS THE SAME GUILD FEEDING LACED BROWNIES TO 12 YEAR OLDS ... I have posted the full message as it was given to us minus personal information from the sender.


Date: Nov 7 2006 10:37 AM

Subject: incident at esco please read!!!

Body:
I am sending this as a letter to all of those who do faire that I care about so that they may warn others. There is a gentleman *I use the term loosely* who goes to the Esco ren faire with the guild ""Laughing Dragon"" who has scared one of my girls from Tsurara and I hope not to give him the chance to hurt anyone else. His name is Bill or atleast that's what he gives out at faire and he's an older man with longish grey hair and a goaty like growth and glasses if you see him near your camp and you have underage girls KICK HIM OUT IMMEDIATLY!!! He has been coming around Tsurara's camp for the past few years that we/they have done Esco and he always comes around to talk to our youngest girl who is only now 16yrs old! Two escos ago he offered to warm her tent for her *he said in a plutonic way* but still at the time she was only 15! then the first weekend of this past faire he offered to do more... all that we have been able to get out of her is that he offered to be her ""first kiss"" I fear that he may of offered more but she's not saying. Even if that is all that he has done that is enough! She was so upset by what he said and how he said it *he was not joking by any stretch of the imagination* that a girl who is normally very calm collected and fun loving darted to the back and was almost shaking when he tried to come by Tsurara's camp during the last weekend of esco. If any of you know our youngest then you know how bad that must be. I don't think that he has actually done anything physically to our girl *yet* but he is in a guild that is made up of a lot of younge minor females, and is usually seen talking to younger girls. If you have had any problems with him, or know someone who has please please please contact me or Condit as I am sending her a letter about this incident requesting that he not be allowed back on site. I feel that he is a danger to our younger ones and our way of living at faire we usually trust other rennies to protect our under-agers as we would theirs. Again his name is Bill he's from Laughing Dragon, and he's in atleast his 50's if not older with all grey hair and glasses. I hope that this can atleast keep someone else from having their faire almost ruined like our girls was. Thank you so very much."

Im hoping everything works out. Other than that I have my final docs appointment for my ankel tomarrow then Im back to full work duty...hopefully I get to go back into the park. Not that I dont mind being in the warehouse where I dont have to tuck in my shirt and deal with annoying kids plus their parents but at least for a few days I would not mind working the register or being with my friends again. With everything thats going on only time will tell."

Yesterday I was at work for 12hrs, had to be there at 7 in the morning to make brownies for my senior project, then had to work from 10am-6pm problem was that I had a really bad day, it was busy and I was extremely cranky...well then I had to sit there and wounder if Chris was going to be able to remember where he had to go to pick me up. He did find his way which was nice. Then when we got to Russ' everything went worse. Three of the guys got really drunk and someone who we dont know yet flooded his bathroom. There was over 2inches of water on the floor and it got deep into the carpet. Me,Chris,Fish and Mell were the only ones cleaning it up, Russ was getting towels and the otheres were playing with his keyboard. It took us about over a hour to get it all cleaned up and the other 3 didnt start to help until we were almost done and Fish got on their asses about it...well I better get Chris up so we can do some cleaning."

"event","Well either today or tomarrow we find out if I am going to be able to move in with Chris after graduation. He thinks that most likely his dad will say yes cause I guess dad likes me. Oh and I figured out why I was so moppy the other day. UNCLE T.O.M. AND AUNT FLOW came to visit for the week. This totally ruins my weekend but its really okay since I was not really wanting anything special in the first place. But things will be cool once I get over next Wednsday...my deadful Senior Project Presentation. But wish me luck and I hope to see everyone at GRADUATION!! Im so excited because my friend Thomas is coming down from Fresno and this is going to be the first time we see each other face to face since we met 4 years ago! Sooooooooooo looking forward to this weekend and I really need to be in his arms. Okay Im going to be getting off...talk to you all later!"

School is stressing me out because its the last couple of weeks, we have our senior projects which i got done but its mostly every thing else and to top it all off my ass hole of a step dad has been going on one of his damn rampages again. YOU NEED TO DO THIS...YOU NEED TO DO THAT..OH THIS SHIT HASNT BEEN DONE RIGHT, LEARN HOW TO DO YOUR GOD DAMN JOBS...it goes on and on and on. I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looking forward to getting the hell out of this place, and if I am not able to move in with Chris I have no idea what I am going to do. I can not stay in my parents house anymore. I want to be home!!! Guess I better go and sweep up the kitchen before I get a 20 min leture that I need to start acting my age and doing my job."

"event","Well this weekend I had an okay time. Friday night Chris came down and gave me a polar bear, but of course my sister took it from me. So anyways...we met up with Andy and Julia at the Regal and sat there trying to figure out what to see, we were going to see The Da Vinci Code, but that got sold out, didnt want to see the movie See No Evil...so we decided to see Over the Hedge,but before we went in we went and got ice cream and Chris go 6 mix-ins, the girl said she had fun making it. well during the movie Julia fell asleep and it wasnt all that good. It did have its moments and according to Andy and Chris and that hyperactive squirel. So after the movie Andy took Julia home, me and Chris went and spent some time by the harbor. Then Saturday morning I got sent to Gem Wash because someone called in sick, and it sucked cause it was slow. After work I was talking to Walter one of the security guards about faires and talking to him about Amtgard,went out with Julia and Andy for pizza then we went to Big Lots, and Kmart and sat there looking for things to make weapons and then we went to the Vista Entertainment center and played arcade games. Julia was talking with Wang and was told to have her tell me that I had to call Chris at Russ' cause he needed to talk to me. So I called him once we left and I guess some stuff happened that day that got him really creaped out and it was really bothering me...so we went and played pool and I called Chris back and we talked and got everything worked out, so now we're okay...then on Sunday I had to be in @ 11:30 but got dropped off around 10am which was okay. Sat at the gate house with Walter and we talked the enitre time. He is planning on joining Amtgaurd which is cool so Im looking forward to that, after work I had some dinner called Fish and told him about what was going on and found out everyone was still at Russ' place cleaning up, I talked to Chris for a lil bit and he said hes going to talk to his dad about me moving in and when he got home he IMed me and said he did and he'll let me know sometime this week before Saturday. This weekend I work 10am-6pm Breaker and Chris is picking me up afterwards and Im spending the weekend with him since i got this coming sunday and monday off due to no school. Well I g2g I need to pay more attention to this assignment!!! Srry its sooo long"

"event","Okay from Friday night, till last night everything was not going very well. Took me and Andy 4 hours to get there since we hot traffic and that was not fun. We camped out in Tent city were no one else was at because there was no room by the guild. Found out Julia was not going to make it up that night, so she and Wang showed up the next morning, so I had the tent to myself. Then found out Chris finally made it around like 930pm and wanted me to help set up, but I was sooo tired we stayed in Julia's tent that night, and just set his up the next day after faire. OMG it was cold on Saturday and hot on Sunday. I did enjoy the faire but there was a lot of shit I did not like. First off St. Paul was all stressed because they forgot the Pikes at Hal's place so Saturday morning me and Chris made the trip back to Long Beach to get them. Took us 3 hours but they were glad he did it. Then with the guild, the people that came with me to Meet & Greet didnt really do much, just sat there, one was drunk and acting stupid the other was just like **duhhhhhhhhhhhhhh**...which really pissed me off. Then 2 kids got hit in the face. The first one, was fine he just got a lil dust in his eye, the second one, the little girls eye started to swell and bruse, so on Sunday me and her fought and I went easy on her. Personaly I extremely do not like the Santa Barbara group. All they did was drink, sit around and were letting the kids swing the weapons like baseball bats, they were not organized and just lil shit.I didnt get to do much on Saturday, I was at camp all day picking up the slack. Fish was doing his best but no one really listened very much. Sunday, I told Fish Id help only a little because I at least wanted to see the battle and look around. I was really needing this faire, now all I need is my bed and a full day of sleep. I had a grand total of 5 headaches, 3 migrans and I was extremly tired and stressed out.And I guessed right, I had to buy a new bodice, which I got from Bodice Goddess, which I was broke afterwards. I did get my frog and an eating knife. Sunday was not cool Julia had to leave early because the fact that her grandparents got into a car accident and I almost passed out when she told me. Right now I am truely contemplating on where or not Im going to go up to Ojai Pirate faire...if I do I'll come up with St. Paul. There were some people from the other group that I did like, Kayla, Forest, Skully, and Nick. So last night I didnt get home till about 1am and I was so tired I just went to bed dirty, I really didnt care, so I woke up and took a shower, right now I have another headache, my allergies are acting up and I need sleep. The Gods only know how Im going to make it through this week. I'll keep you all updated."

I know a lot of people are coming to celibrate with me and Im really glad for that plus Im looking forward to this weekend, I can't wait to see Chris, I really miss his arms around me when I fall asleep at night and then waking up in the morning.....speaking about waking up, this morning was the usual wake-up, get dressed, watch charmed then leave...well when my mom was turing onto college off of Marvin she hit the conner and popped the tire. So her and my brother Paul went back up to the house to get the other car and my moms cell phone...found out that the jack was in the garadge so we couldnt do anything about it. So when mom got us to school she wrote a note so that we dont get lunch detention. Well off to finish the rest of today, then all day tomarrow...leave school by 12:45 on Friday so me and Andy can get up to faire to pitch up the tents."

Work was a pain in the ass this weekend since I was by myself most of the day and I had to call down to Big Shop for help, so I could take my lunch. Other than that everything is going somewhat okay...I am dealing with a lot of shit right now and I do not like the way I have been feeling. Hopefully when I see Chris this weekend and talk to him, I'll be okay for the last 4 weeks of school. Guess I should cut this short and pay attention."

I didn't ignore his IMs thinking hed really leave me alone, well nope didnt work, he IMed me last night telling me his buddy was getting married(which I was thinking ""I told you so!!!"") He also said that I needed to stop crying at night, because it was bothering him. Ummmm NOPE!!! I haven't cried since the last time I talked to him and told him to FUCK OFF!!!! Yeah, thats was bothering me, and all at once the pain came back and I did start to cry. Chris wants to kill him, when Melly and Jimi found out, Melly told me Jimi was looking for his knives...but whatever it is okay. I am just going to keep thinking of Chris and get my life the way I want it so my mind does not wander to the painful times in my life...Well everyone guess you can say Im not totally over him, but I will be soon."

"event","Well its 2 more weeks until Ojai faire and Im really looking forward to it. I know me and Julia are going to be walking around open mouthed cause this is both of ours first time out there. I need to think about buying a new boudise(know i didnt spell that right) and a frog for my hunting knife. Well other than that hanging out with Chris this weekend was extremely interesting. Friday night we watched movies and just cuddled up...felt nice being in his arms again. Then all day Saturday was interesting. We had to meet up with Hal and St. Paul for their practice and meeting before Ojai, and Shay is telling Hal and everyone that by the end of the year I am going to be in that gild with them. Only problem is now I am going to be bound to someone and if I leave, she has to come with. Which leads to BattleSmac. I had fun there, didn't do much was to tired and hungry to do the tournement. Met this really interesting girl and found out me and her are really nsync...very scarey cause every time Chris messed around with me, or Jimi was messing with her the other would feel it. Fishy was thinking ""Oh NO!"" the entire time and knows things are not going to be the same.We were also talking about how McFiyin(not sure how they spell it) and RavenWood are trying to team up and take out St. Paul. Think thats really funny. Found out that Amtgard and St. Paul may be really nice alis. Then it was interesting that people think me and Chris' characters should get married. That is something I am not sure about. Anyways...we all went out to Dennye's except 3 others who I did not pay a lot of attention to. Well out waiter was really really on the ball so he got a $20 tip (THANKS ROBERT) so we all agreed if we go there again to ask for him. We were in the parking lot and one of the guys I met Jimi, started to tickle me and I almost got hit my a damn car. Gave everyone including myself a heartattack. So Chris was sooo tired that I had to stay with him again and he brought me home so I could change for work, and then took me to work. Cant wait for faire and can't wait to see what happens coming up...Other than that I am doing really good and extremely happy school is almost over."

"event","Excalibur Traits and Tendencies  Excalibur couples may battle just as much as other couples (and participate in more than their fair share of public huffs), but they look so good together, it outweighs any other deficiencies they may share. It isn't that they're classically good-looking, or similarly sized (though certainly both those pairings are permissible). It's more that the aesthetic chord they strike satisfies in profound ways. Like gorgeously plated food or song filled with unusual harmonies, the wan and freckled hand-in-hand with the tragically tan, the pigeon-toed with the duck-walkers, these Excalibur couples achieve such perfection in their pairing that reminds the world that anything is possible.  
Comfort Zone  Excalibur is in the Wind pose family. Other Wind poses you might enjoy include Softserve Swirl and The Ventriloquist.  
Health Note  An unexpected rash or orthopedic adjustment can sometimes lead an Excalibur couple to fall out of balance. Physical adjustments may need to be made, or an entirely new pose could even be in order.

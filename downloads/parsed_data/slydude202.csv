"event","<P>Well here's an update for the masses:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life's been a bitch and i've been bored out of my mind. I haven't found anyone cool to hang out with at school. I know people but they're same as the people at St.F . I hate not having friends, before I didn't think it would be that big of a deal not to have friends but now I know what all those kids without friends feel like but it feels like even they have friends. I haven't even seen anyone remotely pretty at my school they are a bunch of ""pansy valley girls"" as tanisnikana would say. I bet <U>she</U> is laughing at me, fucking bitch. UGH why can't i find some cool people to play World of Warcraft with or just someone to exchange manga with?! School has pretty much taken over my life and this winter break has been great and has given me a breather for a bit, but in&nbsp;a while school will start again and i'll have to bust my ass to get an A in chemistry just like last semester. I'd rather be living with my dad but i'm mom won't let me and i'm going to turn another age again soon. Not to vague is it? Good. </P>
<P>Bye all</P>"

"event","True Story. A religion teacher assigned her class an essay on what makes a good Christian. One student wrote about praying nightly, say no to abortion, banning gay marriage, and donating money. The other student wrote about talking to God and allowing people to enjoy their lives, and supporting gay marriage. The day the teacher was to hand the papers back, she called up the second student and told him she would pray for him when he went to hell. The student asked why would he be going to hell, and why he got an F on his paper. The teacher told him that Catholisim is against gay marriage. The student looked at her for a minute, then said aloud, ""I'm gay."" The teacher kicked him out of class as if he had said fuck or worshipped Satan. A girl in the back of class who had a boyfriend and was obviously straight got up and left too.

If you would leave the classroom, repost this. It doesn't matter if you're straight, bi, or gay. It doesn't matter if you're Catholic or not. Everyone is a human being and deserves happiness."

I meet a girl her name is Jen and she is awesome and she makes me feel good which can't be a bad thing. I let her meet my parents yesterday and she said she liked them although i'm sure she just said that. We played pictonary and scabble and had alot of fun. She makes me laugh so much it's the best. Today I helped my Dad pour concreat and that was a whole lot of fun... but it was helping my dad out so I thought ""What the hell"".

 Sister kills me and so I have to take ""breaks"" that consist of me screaming in pillows and releasing stress by screaming all of MCR's songs...
 
 I think i'm depressed.... Sleep during the day and have crazy mood swings, cry randomly, and I did kinda faint the other day. Hmmm this can't be good.

 I have the fucking craziest dreams ever... Baby sex... OMFG it's sooo messed up! I'll wake up sweety and so outa my skin I feel like taking a shower.

 Parents boss me around as If I worked on a cotton field. (No Offense Any 1) The other day they asked me to clean my room and it was already clean and so they where like 
"" I'm going to check! If it's not clean your getting you ass beat!"" 
*Walks upstairs and looks in clean room* 
""Alec get up here! Look at this, there's dust on the window seal... And omg look at this that's discusting, I can't belive that you would put trash in here... "" 
That's a trash can"" 
""Well you should have took that trash out""

"event","today everyone is bitching and it's giving me that biggest headache. If everyone could just be friends it would be soooooo much better, but no! People have to talk behind each others back, People have to fight over the stupidest things, People have to just be assholes to everyone else because that's the way it must be. WELL FUCK ALL OF YOU AND GET OVER YOURSELVES!"

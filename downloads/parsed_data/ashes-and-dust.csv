I think thise one pretty much says everything<br>itself.

In a darkened corner/
	There lay a scarlet rose,/
	Its petals falling gently,/
	Waiting frozen in its pose./

	Thorns pierce tender flesh,/
	Red drops of blood falling down,/
	Raining onto dark petals,/
	Scattered all around./

He's so mean,he invited her over to his house and then leaves after she gets there to go play with his best friend.He didn't even envite her to go with them,he just left her at his house!What an ass hole!She even bought him a wedding ring ,it cost $120,and they weren't even getting married.I've spent two days at her house and I'm going on three.We got to go four-wheeling through the orange groves and down some hidden trails.When we walked down to the bridge and looked over the side,we saw a whole human skeleton,but it was missing a few bones and there was a hat next to it.Then when we looked on the bank of the river we saw shotgun shells.It was really creepy,it looked like it had been there for a really long time because there was nothing but bones and a hat left to it.It was nasty.Well,she's depressed and I've got to go help her so,byez"

Ohh
Ohh

[x5]
Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back..

Dreaming comes so easily
Cause it's all that I've known
True love is a fairy tale
I'm damaged
So how would I know?

[Refrain]
I'm scared
And I'm alone
I'm ashamed and I need for you to know

[Chorus]
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you have taken away
Cause I feel you
I feel you near me

I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you have taken away
Cause I feel you
Ohh I feel you near me

I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you have taken away
Cause I feel you
I feel you near me

I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you have taken away
Cause I feel you
Ohh..
Ohh..

[x2]
Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back..

Healing comes so painfully
And it chills to the bone
Won't let anyone get close to me
I'm damaged
As I'm sure you've known

[Refrain]
I'm scared
And I'm alone
I'm ashamed and I need for you to know

[Chorus]
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you have taken away
Cause I feel you
I feel you near me

I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
And you can't take back what you have taken away
Cause I feel you
Ohh I feel you near me
Ohh feel you near me
Ohh feel you near me

Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back..

I can't go back
I can't go back
I can't go back

I must go on..
I must go on..
I must go on..
I must go on.."

"event","Well, it's just me and my cat sitting here by the computer, well except for my sister who's sitting at the next computer over.We got picked up early from school today cause it was so rainy.It seems sort of peaceful, if we could just turn the damn t.v off.My grandma's sitting here and she's obsessed with her stupid soap opera's and right now this guy's making out with some old,old lady for $1,0000.!!!SICK!!!I wouldn't do that if someone paid me.All I'd end up doing is hanging myself after I got the money,with a golden rope.LOL!I wonder why Amber and my friend Michelle weren't here today?Amber's head probable exploded after yelling at her mom again.LOL!Michelle was also gone yesterday and I'm starting to worry cause she's going through some rough times right now with her mom.I hope she comes tomorrow,along with Amber.Lindzy and Amber are still fighting.I don't think Amber wants her back as a friend again.I get to work at PetsMart again this saturday,then spend the night at Amber's,then sunday we're going to Wire Warfare.It's going to be awsome!Some of my friends from school and Amber's boyfriend might be there.She's happy about that.I'm still failing math,57% F.That sucks bad!!I need a boyfriend bad.All my friends said Justin flirted way too much,but I didn't believe them.Should I?I don't know what to believe anymore....sigh.I honestly am not really enjoying my life right now,there's too many secrets in our family.I can't stand it!!No one in our family talks to each other and when we do it's either cause we are in trouble,mad,or have something mean to say.I mean,I'm the same way.I'm not gonna sit here and act like I don't cause I do."

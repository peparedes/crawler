i can feel spring in the air and its supposed to be in the 60's this week : ) me liz and al took advantage of the springy weather friday night and drove over 3 hours total just to sit on the beach for 10 minutes. Happy 17th Albo. that's a night i'll remember for a long time, cause honestly..who does something like that? you guys never fail to come up with something fun to do<3

its refreshing to meet and hang out with people from other towns. i like making new friends..so much that i've made it a point to do so. not saying my friends now aren't good, i'd just like to ""expand my horizons"". 

nyc was amazing. we saw hairspray and movin' out. listening to becky's life story makes me want to travel the world and do spontaneous things and do something fun with my life because compared to hers my life is so lame. i absolutely love the city. i'm gonna visit a couple schools that are right next to the city cause i figure i want to live in a city at some point in my life, and college is a good opportunity to do that. em's pics..

february vacation was awesome. went to florida with em and her fam, had so much fun. we had good times, good talks, and prolly too many good laughs at things that aren't even remotely funny. it was so nice to get away from this cold retarded town. theres nothing that i love more than lying on the beach in the sun with my ipod. my heart truly lies with the beach. being there made me so excited for summer. too bad its supposed to snow even more this week. andrew came to vermont for a night with my fam. we skiied all day together and just had a very nice time. we're back together. i honestly don't know how that worked out but whatever, we're happy and i guess thats all that matters. things are better now than ever.

i started work. i love it, everyones so nice, the hours are awesome, and its fun. i'm taking my own table tomorrow!(but i have to miss another b-ball tourny game which sucks) i feel so productive when i come home after work, its a nice feeling to be making money.

i got my prom dress! : )i remember we always used to talk about how we can't wait til our prom and now its here and everyones buying their dresses and it just blows my mind how old we are all of a sudden. i got a ring dance dress too, i'm excited to get to have two dances this year with andrew. proms gonna be so much fun i cant waittt..and i think our grade is going to start to get closer which is cool.

i hate hypocrits, even if i am one. i hate bitchyness, why cant people just be nice? i dont even know what to say about this situation, i just hate the way things are going. i feel like everyone's changing, in a bad way. maybe i am too, but i've just noticed it so much in some people and hate it.

we got our course selection sheets for senior year today, thats nuts. senior year needs to live up to the hype. 

it's march, which isn't too bad. i want it to be nice out! i can't wait to drive around with the windows open, wear flip flops and summery clothes, go to DQ, get coolatas and go to lax/baseball games! thats the best time of the year and then before ya know it, it will be summer! omg winter needs to endddd.its so exciting that we have a lot to look forward to. nyc, ring dance, prom, and spring are all coming up very soon! : )

"event","i've been too lazy to update recently but a lot has happened. i am now 16! my sweet 16 was by far the best birthday i've ever had. i got some awesome presents, shitload of money, my permit, and most importantly the new new love of my life, my '94 green camry! i knew my parents would eventually buy me a car and i knew they were looking at this one but i was still really surprised. there was a ribbon from my comp to the garage door opener and went i went outside there it was with a big red bow and everything. i've driven a lot, i love it. it makes me so excited for this summer when i get my license and can open the sunroof and go to the beach and omgg i cant wait til summer. 
 
 saturday night i took liz al em erica jeff ben and nick to dave and busters in providence. we went in a limo (same limo that 50 cent was in, sorry had to throw that in there) and it was so much fun. we might have gotten too into the games but i thoroughly enjoyed myself. i wouldn't be surprised if a few of us have serious gambling problems when we're older. we went to the olive garden for dinner and they slept here. my friends are truly the best and i've never laughed as hard as i do with them. liz and al's bday notes got me a little choked up. it's reassuring to know that through all the gay high school girl drama there are a few that you can really count on, i really cherish my friendship with both of you<3
 
 just as i was starting to convince myself that it was completely over, you had moved on and i should try to do the same, you hit me with this. i definitley wasn't expecting this and still don't know if its the right thing for me to do but after everything you said i believe you and do want to give you a second chance. i think we're good for each other. maybe i'm being naive or a pushover or desperate, idk. but i'm so glad we're talking again and i hope everything ends up the way its supposed to.

 yesterday was jobshadow day. my mom doesnt work on wednesdays so we went out for the day. spent my tiffanys gift certificate, ate at cheesecake factory, and tried on some prom dresses. it was really nice to just spend the day with her. 
 
 i've become numb to all emotions. i dont have extreme feelings anymore. its hard to explain and idk why it is this way but when things happen where i should feel really excited or really sad or whatever i just don't. everything just feels surreal to me lately and i feel like one day i'm gonna wake up and think ""what the fuck. what has my life become?"" 
 
 i wish i could go back to sixth grade where we all had our cliques. i know cliques are looked at as bad and exclusive but at least then you had your little group of reliable friends that you knew were really your friends. you knew who you could trust and who you couldnt. you knew you liked you and who didn't. you knew who you could talk to and hang out with and who you should stay away from. the cliques were so cut and dry then and now everythings just mush lol. sixth grade..those were the days. 
 
 we're supposed to decide about the france trip after our senior year by tomorrow, which i think is really unreasonable. i'm not sure what i wanna do because i wanna go somewhere with everyone since its our last chance to do something all together but france would be so sick. the seniors started their countdown in the cafeteria which means we are that much closer to being seniors and summerrr : )
 
 i can't believe its already february. Happy Sweet Sixteenth Kara! my best friend is turning seventeen is 9 days..whatttt. 

 i've watched half of the first season of OC on dvd and i forgot how good it was. when ryan and marissa were together and oliver was threatening everyones lives..before ryan was dating his adopted aunt and marissa was a lesbian. the second season is still good but can't even compete with the first. i love that showw. speaking of OC, it starts in 15 minutes."

Friday night i went to medfield to see the boys big game with eao and alk. they lost but it was intensee. then olive garden<3 where albo got served.. still can't get over that one. Last night was fun, we made some memories in the blizzard of 05. bundled up and walked to blockbuster and shaws, making a pit stop at warren to play on the slides. the things we'll do for food and 'friday night lights', what a sick movie and jay hernandez makes me like it That much more. it's nice to be around people that you can feel comfortable with and can have a true friendship with.

i'm pumped for my bday. going to chef orient wednesday night, providence on saturday, and family party on sunday. hopefully get my permit and some cool presents. i love birthdays, especially sweet sixteen : )

tomorrow would/could/should be six months. i really miss you, i never realized you meant this much to me. everything reminds me of you in some way. i dont know how long its gonna take me to get over you and i wish i could just realize you're an ass and not worth my time but its not that simple.

snow day tomorrow..i'll take it. half days all week and my bday, not bad minus the whole mid terms part. i love the 90's part deux made me have a craving to see Titanic so i'm gonna go dig it out and watch some before bed. sleeping in tomorrow will feel soo good. bottom line, i just love sleeping and can't get enough. goodnight."

"event","Who knew so much could happen in what, 11 days?

last sunday i got hypnotized. looking back it feels like a dream, not like it really happened. i remember pretty much everything.its weird that just by listening to music and someone's voice they can gain control of your mind and make you think there's nothing wrong with the embarassing things youre doing.it was a cool experience though, i'm glad it worked.

so i'm now single and have been for a week. i dont even know what went wrong. the same spark and excitement that we had before just wasn't there anymore, we got on each other's nerves too easily. since you brought it up and i felt the same way i figured it would be a civil break up and we could still be friends. i suggested taking a break, trying to fix our problems and then maybe we could have the relationship we used to have. we had a good talk, expressed how we felt, and i thought everything would be ok even though i was scared to let go of a comfort that had been there for the past 6 months. everything would be okay, we couldve worked things out, or at least tried to, but i guess you are just too immature and unreasonable for that. well now i feel like you are a complete stranger and want nothing to do with me. you seemed to have moved on pretty quickly, so i'm trying to do the same. i guess i just wasn't expecting this. it still seems surreal to me that i havent really talked to you in almost a week and its just over and done with. its such a drastic change to go from constantly seeing you and talking to you to not even making eye contact when i walk by. our last kiss, our last ""i love you""s, the last time i could just lay in your arms and forget about everything..i took it all for granted. even though deep down i know you aren't the right guy for me,i know we had something really special and you made the last 6 months my best. everyone noticed how much happier i was with you and how you just made me smile. i don't know why i still care or still want to try to be your friend after you've been such an ass and just cold towards me. i guess all the nights this week i've cried myself to sleep is the price i have to pay for all the nights i went to sleep smiling and feeling loved. i hope you don't erase me from your life and we can move past this and build up our friendship again and if we can't i think you'll always have a place in my heart. 

through all the shit he's given me lately and all the heartache i've dealt with, you've been the thing that keeps me going and makes me think that this was for the best because i might get something even better. i've always had feelings for you, we've always had an underlying thing, and maybe now we can have what i've always wanted with you. people say how good we would be together but i just dont know if we would see each other enough and could really make it work. i'm willing to give it a try though, even though i'm scared as hell of just getting hurt again.

the long weekend was great. it was so relaxing and refreshing to just get away from your shit, and the drama with the new year's eves pics, and everyones overall gayness. i went to waterville valley with the fam and liz, who is part of my fam. i'd die without your friendship and i cherish our bond more than anything. i know that our friendship will outlast high school and college and last forever, no matter how far away and busy we are. left new hampshire with some bruises but some good talks and good times too.

i hate selfishness. i can feel the tension and bitchyness in our group of friends. it sucks that we dread dealing with each other everyday. i dont know how to fix that though, if it can be fixed.. we might just have to accept that thats the way it is, which sucks even more. 

ending with some lovely dc..

As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
and sit alone and wonder how you're making out. 
I'm missing your laugh. How did it break? 
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you 're pretending.."

<P>Snow day yesterday! I wokeup at 6,&nbsp;turned on the TV, saw Ashland scroll by on the bottom of the channel, and went back to sleep for another six hours with a big smile on my face. it was the best feeling waking up at 12 and thinking how i shouldve been in school for the past 5 hours. I wasted the entire day doing a whole lot of nothing. erica came over to watch the OC..another great episode. if given the chance i would marry seth cohen. </P>
<P>plans didn't work out but i could've predicted that. i was bummed but whatever, maybe this weekend. i didnt go to school today. idk why i&nbsp;always get sick, i think its a mix of everything..i have a lot on my mind + stress + not getting enough sleep/bad sleeping patterns +&nbsp;anxiety + not eating/exercising right&nbsp;= my body just breaks down and can't handle it..but anyways, i slept til&nbsp;2 and now i have a&nbsp;nice 4 day weekend. i'm getting restless, i havent left my house since wednesday afternoon. mom's not letting me go out tonight but al cristina and liz might visit me later. </P>
<P>i picked up an application to be a waitress with liz and em. i'm excited for the job (if i get it) but i can't turn in my application til my bday. i think its the perfect first job. i'm looking at buying a camry!&nbsp;scary but cool&nbsp;that i could actually own a car in the near future : ) 16 in 20 dayss. </P>
<P>tomorrow i'm going to the mall with erica to finally spend x-mas money. might be going out with colin and katie, doubt that will work out though. there's a sneak preview of coach carterr, i wanna see it soo bad! sunday we have first tourny indoor game then the hypnotist that night. i'm excited for that, i hope it works on me, but i don't wanna do anything too embarassing in front of the whole town. i remember going when i was little and watching the people get hypnotized and i thought they were so old and now its us, weird.</P>

vacations over, thats depressing. i have to read two books, write a 6 page research paper, and im sure theres other homework that i dont even know about. sucks cause i havent done shitt all week and tomorrow i'm screwed. Tonight was low-key, which i think everyone needed, but still fun, played foos and watched garden state - awesome movie.

what am i gonna do for new years? glad i dont have to be in school for another week. its a good feeling to not have any plans and just have empty days to do whatever the hell i want :)

happy birthday alex! wish you weren't a full month older than me. 1 month til 16. i'm already making a birthday list..is that bad since i just got an assload of presents?

i finally learned about my heritage today..i'm mostly russian and english, glad i got that squared away.

Andrew's birthday was yesterday, i hope he had a good day. he got his permit, thats cool, can't picture him driving but whatever. we had a nice night, i'm glad i went there. since he ""honestly doesn't care enough to read my lj"" i won't address him as ""you"" anymore. what a sweetie.

i'm so excited for christmasss! i love the warm christmas spirit feeling. i want these two weeks of school to be overr. it sucks that in order to get to christmas break theres so much work i have to do first. i can't wait to do secret santa with the girls, exchange with liz at the 99, and give andrew his presents (maybe we'll do it xmas eve, cause thats 5 months<3). we set up the tree tonight but we haven't decorated it yet. the lights outside, the decorations, and the tree are kinda sub par this year.  

boston saturday night will be good times. i hope it snows so it will look pretty and everything. i want to go to NYC for my bday soo badly but my aunt didnt seem too into it when i asked her. i'm gonna try and make that work though cause NYC is amazing. can't wait to go in march with ahsts (cause i didnt get kicked out, woo) last year was soo fun and i think this years gonna be even better.

talking about prom today (and thoroughly planning things out/analyzing things way too much)got me really excited! i really hope everything works out nicely and its just the perfect night for everyone. i wanna start looking for dresses soon :) i can't believe its Our prom this year..we've been planning prom since like 8th grade and now we have to legit start planning..so weird.

i'm not sure why i started this entry, i'm just bored and don't feel like doing any work, which i'm sure will catch up to me by the end of the week. whatever, i think i might just to sleep. ive decided sleeping is the one thing i'm truly good at. goodnight<3"

"event","This weekend flew by. Friday night was cool. it was good to do something different, sometimes i get sick of doing the same thing every weekend, so it was nice to switch it up, especially with them. Yesteday, I went to an FH clinic at MIT all day. it was 3 hours of drills and 3 hours or tournament. it was fun and went by quick but i'm feeling it today. i woke up and i was in so much pain but had to get up and go play some more fh, as if 6 hours yesterday wasn't enough. we tied our game, coach came, i think we all played well together, and our shirts are pimp.

  I don't get love. What makes you fall in love? What makes you constantly think of the same person? How can someone be your whole world when like a year ago they were in no way a part of your life. How come when they say something it effects you 10x more then when anyone else says the same thing. I've realized that being alone might be less scary than being with someone. i mean clearly no one wants to be alone, but being with someone puts you at such a high risk to get hurt. i can definitely see how the pleasure isn't always worth the pain. We all spend all of high school wrapped up in the idea of ""love"" and the lastest gossip about whos with who..it like takes over our lives. most songs and movies and tv shows are all about love. im not sure how to explain what i'm trying to say but like we all get into relationships knowing that we're bound to at some point break up or end up hurt..its just weird..

 i was really bummed you didn't come over last night, i just laid in bed all night watching tv and movies by myself thinking about how much better it would be if you were there. i'm glad you had your guys night and you sounded like you really enjoyed yourself, but i just wanted like an hour. and then i was looking forward to our plans today which you kinda blantantly blew off and im still kinda pissed about. but whatever ill prolly call you, argue about everything, then work it out like always. i just wish we didn't fight this much and its never about things that are worth getting in fights over. i never thought i would get this attached but i now realize that i'm very attached, and thats scary, but i guess there's nothing i can do about it.

""we were all in love and we all got hurt"" -thanks vc

i'm gonna go do rest my aching sore body in the hottub, watch how the grinch stole christmas! then maybe do some homework and sort things out with my love.

""to get good grades so you can get into a good college"" who cares!? like honestly, we should be able to just enjoy ourselves and not be so wrapped up in schoolwork. life goes by so quick, we should live it up and not be so bogged down with school.. these are the ""best years of our life"". when am i ever gonna need to know how to balance double replacement reactions or calculate the cosecant of pheta or compare romanticism to transcendatilism or any of the shit we're learning in real life..i'm not. what i Am gonna need to know is how to balance a check book, pay bills, budget money, and like raise children but they don't teach that stuff in school. makes sense huh? oh wait just kidding it makes zero sense! ahh its so frustrating the way our society is run and everyone knows it doesnt make sense that kids spend like 4 hours a night slaving away at homework, studying things they are never gonna use but nothing is done about it cause like my parents told me ""thats just the way it is"".. dude no thats not an acceptable excuse. i understand that like a fundamental education is necessary in order to like function but the expectations in high school are just so stupid. 

whoaa sorry just had to get that rant out. i'm not sure why it was bothering me so much its not like i spend any time studying or doing homework or caring but if i did do what i was supposed to i would be up all night and thats just ridiculous. anywaysss..

left school early today cause i had study last period. i love signing myself out! went to the mall with mamma. bought her a sweater for her birthday. stopped by to see erica at delias, it was cool to see her working there. then mamma bought me christmas/hannukah/birthday presents lol. i'm excited about all the stuff i got : ) i love the holidays! my fams going to florida and on a cruise for christmas so they aren't gonna be around which is kinda a bummer. 

i haven't updated in a while. thanksgiving was good, went to uncle wooks. i friggin love that house, everytime i'm there i just want to move in and never go home, it's just so gorgeous and wook and stace are so cool. there was family there from my dads side that i had never met before. i met my dad's cousins who are my age (and i thought they were hot..is that bad?). they were really cool i wish we could like hang out more. i learned my family has problems i didn't even know about, but every family has their issues so whatever. it doesn't effect me directly so i'm not gonna dwell on it.

the long weekend was ok. extreme bowling was bomb. i did a whole lot of nothing. i'm pissed there was no powderpuff game. i feel like its just never gonna get made up and that sucks cause i really wanted to play and we practiced and made shirts/hats and everything. oh sicks chicks<3

tonights the second to last episode of laguna beach :( tomorrows december whatt!(bunnyx3 rabbitx3, cant forget) i'm getting really excited for the holidays! the next couple of weeks will hopefully go by quick. i think a secret santa is a really good idea for the girls cause no one wants to buy presents for everyone and this way everyone saves money and everyone ends up with one really nice present instead of a bunch of little things. if that works out, it will be fun.

i'm wearing your sweatshirt, it smells like you and i love it.

i have soo much work to do. they really loaded on the work this week. i'm gonna go procrastinate somemore, eacepay."

"event","powderpuff game tomorrow! it got changed to 1 which is gay but w/e. i love our shirts and hats and i'm excited to wear them tomorrow. i'm excited for all the girls to be sitting together on the bleachers tomorrow all in blue at the rally. i distinctly remember the juniors last year walking in and all standing together. they looked like a friggin army cause there was so many of them and they were all so loud. it's weird that that was exactly a year ago. i remember sitting on the smore bleachers talking about how in a year that would be us..and now it IS us. 

 thank god tomorrows a half day and its a short week. i could not handle a full week of school this week. idk why cause we havent had that much work or anything i'm just so lazy and hate doing anything. i just really need this break from school. and after this week theres only what 3 weeks? til christmas!

 i just felt like updating but i don't have much to say. hopefully this long weekend will be fun. im going to study for history a little bit then watch laguna beach, wait for andrew to call, and go to sleep : ) goodnight<3"

"event","things are weird lately. i feel very on my own. in our group of friends, we really can't trust anyone. its a vicious cycle - we talk behind each others backs, people find out, get pissed, and confront each other, we ""resolve the problems"", everything is ok for a while, traits about people or things that they do bother us but we bottle it up inside until we can't take it anymore then we start talking behind each others backs again and the whole thing process starts over. sometimes we like to cover up the problems and pretend everythings ok when its not, which just makes all of us very fake. and sometimes we confront each other and talk things out but i don't think things are ever fully resolved because if they were, we wouldn't repeat the cycle over and over again. i mean i love my friends, i have a lot of fun with them, i care about all of them very much, and i would be a lot more miserable without them but none of us are true good friends to each other. i don't really see this cycle changing either. maybe its cause we're girls, maybe its cause we're in high school, maybe its cause we live in this small town and theres so few of us, maybe its just the way things are meant to be. i'm not sure why it is the way it is, but it just really gets to me. i hope that when i get to college i can change and maybe learn how to be a real good friend. 

 things with you aren't very good right now either. if we want to stop fighting so much you have to be willing to change and listen to what youre doing wrong too. i feel like i apologize so much and i really do try and work on the things you tell me i need to, maybe i don't always succeed in changing but i do put in the effort and i feel like that isn't mutual. but at least i feel like i can trust you, you're more of a constant. i dont know if you realize how much control you have over my emotions. 

i need to just get away from everything sometimes..

 met ben's new girlfriend last night. she's cute, not what i expected. its weird for me to picture him like walking her to classes and calling her and stuff. but whatever, he seems happy so thats good.

i like bowling.

 logue got fired or resigned or whatever. abcunus is the new teacher she starts after thanksgiving. i think its cool that we actually made something happen. we weren't happy with our teacher so we took a stand and something was done about it. i dont know how i feel about abcunus yet but i think she will be better than logue. its going to be a real class now which is kinda a bummer cause i enjoyed doing nothing with logue but at least now i won't leave that class frustrated, bitching, and ready to punch something everyday.

 i'm excited for the short week. we have the rally and p-puff on wednesday. then thanksgiving game and dinner at wooks thursday. should be good times. i'm getting really excited for christmasss! its so true that the two best feelings are going to sleep on christmas eve and leaving school on the last day and having the entire summer ahead of you. 

 i needed some change with the format. not sure if i like it that much but its so frustrating and time consuming to change it now so ill leave it for now.

i've been listening to eminem all day and i love him. he is such an incredible rapper."

"event","went to work with mom today. some quality bonding time and made some money. i wanna work for her like 2 days a week just so i'm making a little money and it makes me feel productive. i think i'm gonna start taking a hip hop workout class at backstage. its an adult class and i might try it out with my mom. i think it would be fun to do with her and i <3 backstage.

what the hell am i gonna do about softball?! ahh im gonna be in a bad mood if i start venting about it but i just wish i could really good at one thing, i dont think thats so much to ask for. i'm just so mediocre at life.

i just got back from a meeting with madame about the france trip. there aren't a lot of people interested so it might have to wait til next summer, but we'll see. i'm torn about what to do though. i know that whatever happens, it will be an experience of a lifetime. there's so many places i wanna go and vacations i wanna take but there just isn't enough time, and everythings so damn expensive. we only have so many weeks off in the next two years and then its off to college and who knows what will happen once we all leave home. i want to go to tropical islands, europe, and on a cruise. i want to go on a vacation with all my girls before we all go to college too : ( vacations are just good times you will never forget and i just don't feel like i have enough time/money to do those things. 

i wish you weren't in trouble. i know its partially my fault and i feel really bad. its just an overall sucky situation and idk if theres anything i can do to help. but i hope it all works out cause i just want you to be happy. when you're not happy, neither am i.

i haven't opened my backpack and its 945..but hey block study tomorrow \m/

i wanna go to ac moore with em and make those memory boxes cause yea i enjoyed making them for the fh seniors so much that i want my own. i also wanna go to providence mall or boston for a day and shop, maybe start looking at dresses cause thats always fun and proms in 7 months! lol 

things to look forward to : ) 
laguna beach/oc
powderpuff. pumped for long sleeve shirts and hats. and the rallyy
thanksgiving break

"event","Pats are winning 23-0. i could've gone to the game but my family didn't wanna cause its too cold out and we wouldn't get home til like 2. I wish we went just cause i would've liked to seen the sox. The pats honored them before the game and they came out with the world series trophy. i think its cool that they support each other, and they're are both such amazing teams. 
 
speaking of amazing teams.. the ahs soccer boys are now south-sectional championsss! their talent bows my mind, especially cause people didn't even think they would be good this year after losing raph and justin. the states quarter finals are sometime this week and theyre playing at BU. thats so cool, i really wanna go. 

NYBS FOR PREZ!

this weekend was alright. first indoor game! we lost..but we should've won. i wasn't as tired and sick as i thought i'd be, but i'll prolly wake up tomorrow really sore. i LOVE playing indoor, especially being the older girls. i dont think next year is gonna be as drama-free as we'd like to think, but for now i'm just gonna enjoy my last year ever of playing indoor fh. _X_

powderpuff practice today! didn't know we were having a legit practice but it was a lot of fun, i really like playing football. i think i'm gonna play either reciever or running back which is cool. i'm excited for tuesday!

in two weeks its thanksgiving and its already second term. where has the time gone? 

i hate the cold weather but i have to admit the snow the other night looked gorgeous on the trees, it was so fresh and white. i miss the summer but i'm excited for christmas and the whole holiday season.

yesterday was ty's birthday. he's 12 now, which seems way too old for my little brother. we went to chef orient tonight to celebrate, good food. he's grown up a lot. 

i hate hypocrits! and gay high school drama. and fake girls. even if i classify as all these things i still hate it and lately it's bothered me to no end."

  2. field hockeys over. where did the season go? it had its up and downs. it was wicked fun at times and then there were times where i wanted to just say fuck all of you and leave. but um overall it was a good season. i'm relieved the seasons over cause i have more free time now to be unproductive and do nothing but sad at the same time cause i do miss it. but indoor starts in a couple of weeks! it blows my mind that we are now the oldest girls in fh. we're like running indoor whattt. we voted for captains yesterday and its crazy that like my good friends are gonna be CAPTAINS of a Varsity team. weird times.
  3. the football boys won last friday and have a chance of winning again this friday! i <3 wearing #12 jersey.
  4. cristina's turning 17 this friday. wtfff. i remember when she was 4. 17 is so old, omg. 
  5.i've let myself become such a bad student. i always manage to get by and hopefully i can get by this term  by passing in stuff late but i just don't understand why i am so lazy and procrastinate so much. deep down i want to do really well in school and do my homework and study but theres the other side of me thats just so lazy and doesnt care and would rather do anything else, and that side always wins. its so frustrating and i wish i could change. i always have things hanging over my head and i always have a reason to be angry at myself and i wish i could fix that..i really don't think i can though. i've tried forever to work on like time management and study habits and resposibilty and i just suck at all of it. ahhh.
  6. all my friends are driving, getting their own cars, getting licenses. since when are they all grown up? liz nick al and cristina already have their licenses and em will get hers this weekend and i haven't even started drivers ed, wow. i still have a couple months til i even get my permit. disregarding the fact that everyone has already been driving for months, i'm really excited to get my permit and drive everywhere. and i'm excited for my sweet 16th! not sure what i'm gonna do yet but its gonna be good.
  7. the pats lost on sunday. they broke the 21 game winning streak. its okay though, they'll just start another streak next week and break their own record. going to the game on the 14th with the fam for ty's bday! #26<3
  8. my little brother is turning 12.
  9. i can't think of another thing but i want 10 things on this list, cause 9 would just be h-mo.
 10. THE BOSTON RED SOX REVERSED THE CURSE AND WON THE WORLD SERIESS!!

 apparently theres a lot i can't believe. anyways.. last night was really fun. i went to olive garden then fun and games with andrew jeff and liz. i think laser tag, skiball, and the photo booth was a little too fun but whatever. what made it even better was that it was a monday night and we dont have school todayy. we don't have one full week of school in novemeber, thats sick. lately school has put such a damper on everything that the less times i have to be in that hell hole this month the better.
  i think i might start working at the store next week after school or doing work for my dad or something cause i need money but i can't handle a real job. that will keep me busy after school too.

this entry is a prime example of my procrastination. i have a research paper to do that was due yesterday but instead i'm doing this. wtf is wrong with me, honestly."

 i love the Boston Red Sox. I wanted to cry last night i was so happy for them. They exceeded everyone's expectations, proved everyone wrong, and rolled up and smoked the Yankees. I'm so pumped for the World Series! it feel so good rubbing it in chris's face too : )AL CHAMPS BABYY- Curse of the Bambino that!

we won our fh game yesterday. we need 3/3 wins to make tourny. if the sox can do, we can too.

i'm pumped for the rally tomorrow. can't wait to shit on the unoriginal ""smoreos"". love for my oh sicks girls<3

last weekend was awesome. Nellie is kind of a pain but i love her anyways, she is so adorable. going to the pats game with you was such a great experience. i'm glad you came to wook's to meet the whole fam too. they all really like you, and so do i<3 hopefully this weekend will be good too. i think me and liz are helping out at KNO which should be a good time and homecomings tomorrow night. the fh team is going to a college game on sunday, julies bdayy! looking forward to all of it.

i gotta go to the nhs induction in a little bit. its this whole big thing and my familys making a huge deal out of it and i really wish they wouldn't because that will make me feel even worse if i get put on probation next term if i dont have the grades. but whatever i'll worry about that when it comes.

short entry, just wanted to profess my love for the sox!

"event","it feels good to be back on my computer finally. thank god tomorrows friday, this week has been weird. i didnt get a letter from nhs in the mail saying whether i was accepted or not so i went to her yesterday and she printed me out a letter saying i was rejected which really bummed me out. i got all down on myself and hated myself all last night, in typical me fashion. i decided to appeal it today so i did and i completely winged it. it was the most nerve-racking thing ever, standing in front of 6 teachers trying to convice them that you are good enough to be a member and then being asked to stand in the hall so they can talk about you and decide whether youre good enough. well after all that, i ended up being accepted so i guess in the end it all worked out. i wish things would just straight up go well for me for once without any complications. theres always something that has to go wrong before things can be good.
 
my friends were happy for me which made me feel good and my parents were really proud which made me feel even better. without the motivation my friends give me i would give up on things quicker. they try and give me the confidence i need to drive myself to do things and i love them for that. it scares me that i don't have that motivation or confidence on my own though because what is gonna happen when we all split up to go to college (tear) and i'm on my own..terrifying thought..moving on..

my dad said hes trying to get Pats tickets for me and andrew for either this weekend or next weekend. i'm so excited, that would be soo much fun! especially cause he's never been to a game. i think it would be something really special and fun for us to do together so hopefully dad will follow through. i hope my parents follow through with the whole dog thing too. we've talked about it for years but i think this time it could be for real. my mom went to look at them the other day and she took pics and the puppies are adorable. it will be a sick bday present for ty too cause he doesnt know and he wants a dog really bad. i wasn't too fond of the idea but its def grown on me and now i hope we do get one..my mom said as soon as this weekend : )
 
schools not that bad. this year isnt what i expected it to be, hard to explain but its just different. i've managed to get by this week without doing any work which is always a good thing. block scheduling makes the days go by fast, i hated it in the beginning but ive gotten used to it and actually come to like it.
 
we had a sick game in holliston last night, it got soo intense in the end. it was the hardest game we had to play the second half of the season and we tied 1-1 which is good because it means tourny is still a possibility! jeff and andrew came to watch, which made it even better. fh has become stressful with all the bitching, i'm so sick of the drama. even with all the shit i still look forward to practices and games and everything. omg, i can't wait for indoor! 

the sox lost the first two games of the playoffs against the fuckin yankees. i hate them so much and i just want the sox to win soo badd! #24<3

i think thats all i have to say for now.

 Last night was a good time. Me and Andrew went on a double date with Jiz mwaha. we wanted to see the forgotten but it was sold out so we went bowling. i was on both winning teams :p it was really fun and then we came back here and went hottubin'. 

 we have a game tomorrow in BMR, i really hope we can pick up the intensity and kick ass cause it feels so damn good to win. no win will ever feel as good as thursdays though. we beat hop-town 2-1 in the rain, under the lights, with a lot of people/you there and soccer games going on. liz had the game-winning goal cause shes illl and it was just so intense. i will always remember the feeling of driving home with liz in the van listening to jojo's ""its you"" and enjoying the victory. the thought of that moment makes me smile even now : )

"event","I need to clean my room, i should do homework, but instead i'm updating..

I love friday nights. Last night I went to Medway to support the football boys(#12) with liz ape and em after our game in Medfield. We lost and so did the football team but whatever. We had some personal deep talks in the blockbuster parking lot and my kitchen and it was reassuring to know that i have true friends. I love you girls<3 We're all really different and independent but we always have a good time together, and we can confide in and trust each other. I've realized how rare it is to find such good friends like you guys. There are so many girls that don't know what its like to have true best friends and spend their lives floating from friend to friend. Our tight group of friends is different from all the other cliques, our bond is  deeper than just a ""group of friends to party with on the weekends"". We've all matured and grown up together and we all know each other prolly too well. 

I'm glad i've matured and changed and just grown as a person cause now i'm so much happier with who i am. i have a better outlook on everything and i hope things only get better.

 It's amazing how school and field hockey take over my life. i really wish i had time to do things i wanna do. weekends just aren't enough time. nothing beats the feeling of friday night, knowing you can sleep in tomorrow and you dont have anything to do. but then you wake up saturday morning and waste away all day and then all of a sudden its sunday and you have to go to practice and do homework cause you have school tomorrow. i look forward to the weekend all week and it just flies by and it makes me really angry, clearly.
 
i can't wait for fh next year. things are gonna be so different. i can gaurantee there isnt going to be as much drama and we won't be so bitchy.and hey maybe we could win a lot too.   

i'm looking forward to hanging out with you tonight. i'm just waiting for you to get home so we can make plans. i'm sorry you had such a shitty day/night yesterday. hopefully tonight will be better: )
 i'm gonna go try to enjoy the rest of my saturday, and not let it waste away.

ps. im not sure what i think about this new format."

"event","i hate sundays. i hate being such a lazy procrastinator. no doubt in 10 hours from now i'll be sitting in this same spot with the same amount of work accomplished..nothing. i hate how instead of being inside all day trying to do work i should be outside enjoying the beautiful weather. i miss the summer carefree lifestyle so muchh. now every week we just wish away the 5 days of school to get to the weekend which is never as great as we anticipate and always goes by way too fast. i think thats such a bad way to live your life, every week just wishing away 5 days all for 2 days that aren't even worth it. there's always so much that i want to do every weekend but there's just never enough time. we should be enjoying every single day and living it to the fullest but instead we just cant wait til its over, i just think that's so sad.

 a lot has happened since the last update. i broke up with my boyfriend, realized the reason i did it was to fufill feelings and wishes i had had in the past that no longer existed, regretted my decision, got back together with my lovely boyfriend, and hurt a good friend. Even though this time you aren't getting what you want, i know you'll always be there for me and i'm glad you handled everything the way you did. Its weird having two really great guys have feelings for me at the same time. I'm not even used to one guy liking me, but of course that would happen, no one likes me for years, then two great guys do at the same time. In the end i'm glad things worked out the way they did. I think it made our relationship stronger and we got closer. Things with us are better than ever and i'm so lucky to have you. everytime i'm with you i realize that more and more. 

 we won an FH game! it was sick, it felt so good to win. sometimes i get really aggravated with field hockey and the team and don't enjoy it at all but other times i love the team and have so much fun so idk. i scored a goal and was in the paper for our game against westwood, that was a first :)

this whole nhs deal is causing a lot of stress. the whole concept of nhs is so fake and full of lies and bullshit but still, i really hope i get accepted.
 
 last night i went to andrew's football game in medfield with liz. we had a lot of fun trying to find our way there and just driving around listening to music and talking. i thoroughly enjoyed myself. i didn't think it was possible for me and you to get closer but we have and i love it.747<3

 i&nbsp;started in my first real varsity game on friday. it was awesome under the lights, with a legit crowd, playing next to the soccer teams. b-ham beat us 6-0 but it was a good game i love my team, our coach, the way we play together, and our bond. team sleepover after the game was a lot of fun. saturday i went to rivere beach with liz, krissie, kara, sarah novak, kristen, and erica w. to play in the beach olympics to raise money for the special olympics. it&nbsp;was&nbsp;so much fun, we&nbsp;got free food/stuff&nbsp;and we got community service for it. gt. i felt accomplished for actually doing it and raising money for a cause. i'm really glad i did it and want to go back next year. </FONT></P>

 after being cut from the team i ended up making varsity field hockey. i dont agree with the way some things were handled but i'm trying to just move on&nbsp;and enjoy the season. we had a scrimmage on thursday and i got playing time, which is a good start. the first half i played like shit but i think i improved by the second half. i think it will take some getting used to but i'm really excited for the season and this is the first time i've actually look forward to a sport. </FONT></P>
 i think my&nbsp;two&nbsp;strongest friendships are so tight because of the things we've been through together. the things i've gone through with the both of you are real, tough situations but in the end only make our friendships stronger i think. the rough times that the both of you have gone through have made me a better friend, mature quicker, changed my perspective on things, and&nbsp;helped me learn so much about life in general.&nbsp;after all the arguing and everything we always work it out. i'm so happy to have the bonds that i do with my friends.</FONT></P>

 last night i went through the ""summer 04 list of things to do"" and we didnt accomplish as many as i would have liked to. this summer wasnt what i thought it would be. overall i would say it was good but it wasnt as stellar as i had hoped. i made a new list ""junior year list of things to do"" and it made me excited for this year. im excited to be an upperclassman, go to prom, everyone getting their licenses. but i also dont want to have to deal with ""the most important year of high school""</FONT></P>

 We played poker again last night, lost 5 bucks but it was a good time. We went swimming at Zaks, his parents are really nice. I think i'm gonna see the village tonight which i'm excited about cause jeff and aj said it was really good and scary. new road rules is on tonight too : )
 Tomorrows eca's sweet sixteenth! i hope shes excited cause i hate when people dont get pumped for their birthdays...you only get one a year and you only turn 16 once so celebrate and enjoy it, jesus.&nbsp;hopefully the beach trip on saturday will work out because that will be so much fun, spending a day at the beach, my favorite place to be, with my favorite people to be with. &lt;3
 i'm excited to go to the cape for a week with the fam and liz and i know it will be good times but it cant compare to obx. and once&nbsp;thats over its like two weeks til back to school which isnt long at all. i love summer so much and back to school makes me depressed and i dread it more than anything else.&nbsp;i think its really sad that schools so bad that we dread it as much as we do.
i need to do something productive today, maybe ill finally clean my room. maybe not."

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp; its now august. (bunnyx3, rabbitx3) where has summer gone? liz pretty much summed up alot of my feelings in her lj. i just waste so much time worrying about how fast summer is going by and i'm constantly thinking about it that i dont think i'm enjoying it to the fullest. but idk how to change that. i just try and enjoy everyday and not overthink things but its hard to when the days and weeks just go by so fast. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;on friday i went to the beach with drew em liz and jeff. it was the first time we went on our own. i went food shopping with liz and jeff the night before and we felt so self sufficient, its a good feeling. lately i've realized that we really are growing up. i've noticed that we've grown up a lot and it weirds me out. the beach never fails to put me in a good mood, neither do my friends, so&nbsp;that was good times. it makes me happy to see you laugh so hard cause i know youre legit having fun and you deserve that more than anyone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;</FONT><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii have a boyfriendd.. whattt. i missed talking to/seeing&nbsp;him today. strange to think that for the past month&nbsp;and a half-ish&nbsp;i've talked to him every single night&nbsp;before going to sleep.&nbsp;its so surreal that i have&nbsp;a boyfriend. like where did this come from? i was convinced for the longest time that nothing good like this could/would happen to me. I feel so comfortable with you and i love talking to you and being around you and being held by you. Sometimes i have my moods and i dont think it can work and rethink everything i'm doing, but deep down i&nbsp;know that we can work through issues we have and i truly think that this could be&nbsp;a great, healthy,&nbsp;long lasting relationship.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;the sox traded nomar to the cubs : (&nbsp; he just reminds me of boston and i cant picture him anywhere else. after a little convincing from ty i think its for the best for the team. nomah- you'll be missed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>after seeing signs again and talking about it with liz and heff i strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and everything that happens (down to the smallest details) was meant to happen/be that way.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>since its now 2am and i dont have drewy to talk to i think i'm gonna go to sleep on the couch cause i'm too lazy to go upstairs. goodnight&lt;3</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;lifes so crazy and you can never expect what's ahead, and that really scares me. last night i went from the best feeling in the world because school had ended (the feeling&nbsp;is really indescribable, but you know what im talking about) to the worst feeling in the world, the feeling where you cant do/say anything to make it better for your crying friend because you don't know whats going to happen. i wished there was something i could do/say but there wasn't, we just sat in the dark in silence trying to understand what had happened. looking back now it seems so surreal. i love you and im so glad you came to me, that really means a lot. everything really will be okay.&lt;3</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;it was a good weekend. the last weekend before summerrr. it hasnt really sunk in that this friday is the beginning of summer. this weekend really reminded me of last summer, which was awesome. overlooking the bad, i was stuffed into a trash can and lost my cell phone, it was fun hanging out all day with nick and ben. the weather was beautiful the whole weekend. i went to jo's beach saturday and just laid in the sun. i love the beach so much..the sound of the ocean, the feeling of the sand and the sun, and the care-free summery atmosphere is simply amazing.</P>

<P><FONT size=2>i saw the notebook with em and erica last night. it was so sad but such a good moviee. then all the chaos started. i feel like its karma that it didnt work out. maybe not karma, maybe just the story of my life, things backfiring and not working out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>i talked to you so much this weekend and im starting to think things could work. you make me smile. and as for you, im starting to get over you since reality is kicking in. i'm sure you'll do something to draw me back soon though. i just dont like how sometimes i'll feel guilty for the feelings i have.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>i think i was wrong about thinking you werent what i thought lol...youre a genuinely sweet person. the whole concept is just really weird to me, im not sure ive ever been in this position before. its just different, but i like it. i like the way things are going lately, with everything.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>you're really sweet and you flatter me more than deserved. i just think if i did like you it would be for the wrong reasons. this is the second time this has happened..its just not the right person. i feel like youre doing exactly what he did, maybe he's even telling you what to do. this is the part where i just wait for myself to fuck it up somehow or just let it waste away to nothing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>one problem cant be resolved without another one beginning. i shouldve expected this. i was stupid for thinking things&nbsp;would actually work out the way i wanted them to, like i always do. i just wish for once things would happen in my favor. just when i thought things were starting to look better, things like this happen. i should've seen it coming. who was i for thinking things were getting better and maybe even turning around.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>when you and one of your best friends are in the same position, have the same opinion, and feel the same way about something. when you bond and become really close, largely in part to this one thing. when youre expecting to experience it together. when you&nbsp;love and cherish the fact that you two share this view. when things are made a lot easier because you have this one person that totally understands. and then they go and experience it without you. when they break that bond that you had. when suddenly you're left alone, feeling betrayed, hurt, and overall&nbsp;like a loser...<STRONG>what are you supposed to do?</STRONG> when you express your feelings about what they have done to your friend. when you feel they are genuinely sorry. when you know that even though they are sorry and wish they could go back, they cant. when you talk it out and both understand each other. when you guys arent fighting, but know things can't return to how they were..<STRONG>where does that leave you? where are you supposed to go from there?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>well i dont know&nbsp;the answer to these questions and i guess now i'm just trying to figure them out.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>on a happier note...i'm glad things are starting to return back to normal between you and me. there was a long period of tension where it wasn't good. but i love the feeling&nbsp;i have after a long talk with you when i feel like you really do understand what i'm saying and i feel like we've accomplished something and made our friendship stronger because of it. no one can ever replace you and you really do mean a lot to me, regardless of the way i act/what i say sometimes. i'm sorry that sometimes i can't offer you everything you offer me. but i love you and i'm really going to try to do the best i can.&lt;3</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>sometimes i think that things are so bad and i just hate everything and i dont allow myself to see any positive, only negative. then other times im able to look on the bright side and see all the good things going on, even if it doesnt overtake the bad. i honestly don't know why&nbsp;i have so many inner problems and i dont know why i am the way i am sometimes. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>i hope everything works itself out and things, just for a change, end up the way i would like them to. and thats not referring to anything in particular, i just hope overall things get better, cause i dont know if i can handle two more years of all the shit overtaking the good things.</FONT></P>"

"event","so its been a while and i've hit a massive wall of lies and deception. First to get this out into the void, i saw him about 3 weeks ago. And I still feel love for him and from him. I'm at the point where i think i'm psycho. I know i can't force anyone to be with me and have to accept things as they are but i'm real unhappy. i don't even want the comapny of other men. I don't want to be bothered by anyone. He really was it for me, yes the one and in my heart of hearts i know this, but in order to have something to refer to why i should hate him i figured i'd  write them out and see if maybe after reading it over and over. Lets start with the night that he met the so called slut from the hockey game and he told me he just got drunk, then his tryst with megan the 18 yr old that came over with her friends and he fucked her even though she was a dead fish. He mentioned seeing clarisa again in januaryy which prompted him to break up with me before valentines day. But out of whatever reason he wanted me back and made my valentines day that year the best ever. Things were grerat for the next 2 months till the day after he got home from mississippi and i found the blonde hair, he told me that his friends used the apt, but then his friend slipped and said his gf had dyed her hair this ugly red color. In a few weeks i asked about her and he said he hadn't spoken to her in over 3 weeks. Things were fine for the next month since he was going to cancun, he went kept his promise about calling me, kept his promise about seeing me when he got back, then a week later he imported pussy from canada - some cancun whore he met down there and then told me that she was here on ""business"" whatever, things were ending there. We seperated. I found out that he had pepe la pew come to house upstate through another slip of the toungue. Another month had gone by and i started to date this guy, who was great but kept in contact with sir asshole krg. We were talking one night and he mentioned how clarisa and him went out and she waas so drunk that she got sick and passed out and he couldn't even get any from her. The last weeks of july he was acting as if he really wanted to work things out, things were great till i left for jamacia, found out he had pepe over again while i was gone. It is now sept 2003. He said he was done with pepe and would no longer see her, but he ran into his ex rebecca and didn't know how he felt about her and then about me anymore. we decided to call it quits after that, but he still came by to see me everyday twice a day in my shop. That ended in the begining of nov when i cracked and couldn't take it, sent him a letter which caused him to really stay away. Thanksgiving came and i confronted him and told him i missed him. He started to come around again and hang out with me. His birthday weekk he disappeared. Then the week of christmas he reappeared and  was nicer than ever. New years 2004 came and i heard from him but didn't spend it with him. We saw eachother everyday w=either in my shop of his until January 22 2004 when i had said to him doesn't he miss me and want me back? His reply was yes, but he was dating someone, but she was getting old and he was tired of her shit anyway, so getting back with me sounded like a good idea. That night i got drunk b/c he never mentioned dating someone else since sept., and whenever i asked his reply was no i'm not seeing anyone, i just want to be alone, so being drunk at 2 am i called after i had left tims bar and he said he couldn't talk. I called back and she picked up said that she was his gf and never call back, then she continued to yell at me and he didn't do a damn thing. A week passed and his new gf came in, it was clarisa. Bitch. You caN READ THE EARLIER ENTRY  ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH HER, but for someone who was geting old and annoying she managaed to stay committed to him ever since. I've seen him only a handful of times since then, but i've heard the stories. I wonder what he has heard? The guys I'm dating now, are wonderful but i can't even be bothered with effort.I saw troy last night and this sounds stupid i watched brad pitts eyes when ever he said his lines and he was so truthful. K, when you look aat her are you looking at her the way you looked at me? Are you holding them the way you held me? Does it feel the same? or is it all a lie? It must be hard to be so good at breaking hearts."

"event","i broke and i called him this week. Of course he didn't pick up or call back. I saw him with her and it killed me. He wants to move on and without me and i have to accept it. I got completely shit faced last night and i think i saw my other ex at the bar i was at which was totally ironic because that one i never want to speak to again. I started to buy all the things I left at kevs house. Slowly but surely i'll get everything back materialistic and non that he took from me. But i don't think when it comes all to light that he doesn't want me i really will never be the same. Sad but true. I'm hardened and bitter and becoming a cynical bitch. You can see it in my face. I look tired. Its horrible. I don't think i've ever really been wanted by anyone. I just drift. Noone in my life really cares if i'm here or not. Maybe i should just leave this life and start a new one somewhere else. Like arizona. 
Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
the shadow in the background of the morgue
the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
we can live like Jack and Sally if we want
where you can always find me
we'll have Halloween on Christmas
and in the night we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends

(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)

Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
this sick strange darkness
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as I stared I counted
webs from all the spiders
catching things and eating their insides
like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
will you come home and stop this pain tonight
stop this pain tonight"

"event","I""m tired of acting. tired of being. Tired of putting on some face that makes everyone in my life think that i'm ok with everything thats been going on. I stopped talking to my friends because they donn't want to hear it, oir know whats going on because they don't care. they have their own lives they're wrapped up in. My life has turned into a daily routine where i wake up, cry, cry in the shower, put on mtv, try to dance and smile a little, get into character i guess, wrap a scarf around my neck, put my jacket on, go get a cup of tea to relax me and go to the city. Go to school and take up space. Go tto work and pretend to be fine. Smile and flirt with everyone so that they think i'm strong and have it all together. The truth is i'm screaming. Last night i took a mixture of several types of medication and nothing. Woke up in 8 hrs flat. didn't even sleep the day away. I called my ex and left him a quick message. You ever really want to just blurt out i don't care about everything that happened? I just miss you. I just miss you. I don't know why. There wasn't anything incredibly special, but many suttleties of moments that make up one whole world of special. To know that we had such a great time together and never fought about us was the greatest feeling, to know we were both perfect in eachothers eyes. I hate not knowing why you choose her. I hate being me. I have so many ideas on how to change me, but my heart is so broken and destroyed that i wouldn't know where to look.I don't have the strength to face you to talk about it, maybe if you were just an asshole to my face then i'd think different, but you looked like you were going to cry when we spoke, and that killed a little part in me. My heart is still breaking. I can't even find comfort in someone elses arms. You ever wonder if you ever really meant something? Or if your memory is just a memory that has begun to fade to just random thoughts at random things?Do you know that someone came in and offeered me tickets to go see Van morrisson? God I miss you babe."

"event","things are a little weird - it's been over a month since i've spoken to him and almost a month since his new girl confronted me - but oddly enough i'm fine. I miss him a little. I've been on a constant party riot with my friends. I've met a few really nice new people and i'm glad they've come into my life. I'm thinking about moving and starting over. I have enough money, I might as well"

"event","I want to know why you did this to me? I feel like such utter shit and its all thanks to you not caring. If you had a thing for her when you w=met her then why stay with me for over a year? Why ruin my life when i told you its already been ruined a million times over? Are you happy to know that ican't sleep? I can't concentrate? All i think about is how much of a whore i am for you to treat me like that. How little you must think of me to treat me like this. How much you don't want me in your life. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of being good, and doing the right thing, it gets me no where. I so want to scream at you but i don't want to give  you the satisfaction of knowing how deeply you hurt me. I can't believe that i hope you are happy and that things happen for a reason so whats the reason these things keep happening to me? I'm starting to think i should just shut everyone out of my life, become dull and boring therefore unattractive and unwanted. If no one cares about me in my immediate family, if my friends can't handle me, and the men who i thought loved me never did then whats the point? I'm tired of trusting people, and i'm tired of caring so much. I'm mentally and physically exhausted. MY happiness is gone. I have no idea what ever made me happy. This letter is not only for you but for every other guy that i trusted and left. The worst part is how i know you'll be back just like the other guys and i'll look at you and smile. I'm so weak - fuck."

"event","So i've come to the conclusion tonight that i've never been loved. A harsh thing to say, but also a harsh reality to live. Recently theguy that i loved since July 2002 has just proven how much disrespect for me and how much disregard he had for me by doing nothing. And i mean that literally. Whenever i saw him i would get excited. I loved to be with him and around him, so much i'm afraid that i lost all vision of how he really saw me. I'm currently terrified of seeing him because i think i would break in front of him. Last week i found out through accident that he had a new girlfriend. The way i found out was i had called him that night, around 3 am or so and when he picked up, hung up and i called back i spoke to her. The voice of another girl was real, and she was real mad. I haven't heard from him since, however i did get a visit from the new girl at my job last week, and what can i say - i 'm blank and i feel weird about it. I haven't heard from him since, i haven't seen him, its as if we died and what happened between uswas nonexistant. Theres a part of me that wishes he would've told me sooner, so that i wouldn't have to find out this way - but thekiller, theclencher is that he always gave me this speech on how he wasn't ready - truth be told he never actaully wanted me. My relationship with him was just history repeating itself and i'm left like an empty shell with nothing. I don't plan on living well to be best revenge even though thats what everyone tells me, i feel too much like nothing to be something. I want to give up and give in to the cards i was dealt, to be unlovable and dispensable."

"event","I know you think that I shouldn't still love you, 
I'll tell you that.
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it 
where's the sense in that? 

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder 
Or return to where we were 

Well I will go down with this ship 
And I won't put my hands up and surrender 
There will be no white flag above my door 
I'm in love and always will be 

I know I left too much mess and 
destruction to come back again 
And I caused but nothing but trouble 
I understand if you can't talk to me again 
And if you live by the rules of ""it's over"" 
then I'm sure that that makes sense 

Well I will go down with this ship 
And I won't put my hands up and surrender 
There will be no white flag above my door 
I'm in love and always will be 

And when we meet 
Which I'm sure we will 
All that was then 
Will be there still 
I'll let it pass 
And hold my tongue 
And you will think 
That I've moved on.... 

Well I will go down with this ship 
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be"

"event","this has been the real reason that i started to write in this thanks to a friend that made me think that if i had something to talk to wwhen i was having these midnight fits and panicing to no end i could write to someone. I guess right now i just miss my life, the one i used to have not too long ago and i miss having an outlet for everything that was going wrong with me .  And now i just go right into panic mode ........I hate it i just wake up crying and hshaking  how do you explain this to someone without them thinking your crazy? Psycho even? I can't even finish a thought none the less feel healthy. I just looked at my neck and i scratched it up i tore a hole in the side of it. Is it so bad to know what made you feel normal at one point and that that one thing made you feel complete even if it was a guilty pleasure? Even after its been soo long you can't help but need itlike a drug..........and then to be so scared to lose what you have right now because you know they can't handle anything else? I do feel calmer as I'm writing - weird huh?"

"event","I went last night to go see this movie ""the mona lisa smile"". Despite all its bad reviews i really enjoyed it. I guess for one the main character julia roberts who was playing a character that was an art history teacher but not yet a doctor. she was unable to fall in love or keep the capacities of being in love. Her students did however admire her and her will, but weren't too sure they stood for the ethics she lived by which was to be as independent as possible. It took place in the 50's when being a homemaker was still every girls dream - except the girls she was teaching could've aspired to be much greater than doris day. I did feel threatened after the movie. i've been in college since i was 17 and i'm now 24. I can't decoded what i want to do and now i'm wondering if i'm just wandering aimlessly through it or wandering with the aim of knowing everything. I love the thrill of shocking people with what i actaully know as far as dead languages history art etc.....but what good is it all if i don't apply them to something? The most use i get out of my massive brain is that i can see 300 people a day at my shop and never ask them what they need cause i already know - down to the type grind,sweetness,heat - i'm a barista if i haven't mentioned that. I have to figure it out - just more crap to sort out."

"event","Its a new year and i vowed to myself that i will do better this year in all areas of my life. I escape the world too much and i have been running from my problems and hiding from everyone. I find it very hard to date and meet new people and i hate the factor that i'm ok with that. I know what i need to do to make everyone else happy - but the sad truth is i'm very content and happy with the way things are now. I miss someone very much  and can't figure out why. men are so complicated. I want to believe that if women were stern and stood their ground - things would be different - but i don't think they would be better. i can't find a real man. My prince charming, someone special. Why is that? Are men just so used to the idea of never growing up and being unloved and old a better alternative to dealing with a real relationship?"

"event","We picked out tuxes this weekend.  Men's Wearhouse is cool and uses flash on their site, though, so I can't post pictures. But they are Jones New York (Because the lady said they're more athletically cut), one button (because the choice was one or three), notch collar.  The vests are all kind of diamond studded--it's hard to describe, but basically it was just about the only pattern that came in yellow rather than pukey gold, and the matching green pattern is about the same shade as the girls' dresses, so we went with it.  And the dads will have silver.  Even though the girl tried to talk us into gold.  Whateva!  The white one looked funny, though, because the diamonds were silver, so Dan got a different texture with connected diamonds.  Because he can be different and special.  Oh, and neckties.  And the shirts that have the collars that go better with neckties instead of bowties, whatever those are called.  Pointed?  Anyway.

We have the photographer for sure.  She's also going to do an engagement photo session with us for an extra $50.  It will be a good way to see what it's like to work with her, and to see how the pictures come out.

Last but not least...we bought a ring for Daniel.  So we're doing pretty good as far as the important, must-have stuff goes.  Cake is next!"

"event","Invitations are ordered!  We even found ones that were inexpensive enough that we could splurge on some colored ink.  Big spenders, I know.  We cut cost by deciding to print our own reception/RSVP info...I'll probably find some stationary somewhere and make an insert to go in the invitations.  Oh, and when we were ordering them we realized that we needed to set a time, which we hadn't done yet.  So we went with 4:00--hopefully early enough to be done with the ceremony and pictures before people start to get hungry, but late enough to give us time to set up, and to take advantage of the cooler, shadier part of the day for the reception (also it's technically afternoon so tea-length dresses for the 'maids will still be socially acceptable. That way they'll be cooler, and can change into flip flops later without worrying about hemlines).

Hopefully bridesmaids dresses will be chosen and ordered this weekend, too.  And maybe we'll even book a caterer.  What progress!

Oh, also I'm looking at paper and bamboo parasols...they're $25/dozen from the oriental trading co.  We can leave them plain white or paint them.  I thought the ladies in the party might enjoy some shade during the ceremony.  I think if guests used them they would block each others' view, but maybe we can have some on hand for people to use during the reciption.  ...just a thought.  Paper fans are another thought, they're $3-5 a dozen.

P.S.  I have my dress on hand; it's sort of a load off.  Well, not on hand...I stached it in my parents' attic.  Still...it's here, all safe and sound and waiting for me to find a low-in-the-back, strapless bra and kitten-heel shoes so I can get it altered (it needs to be taken in pretty much all over...)"

"event","Here's a couple pictures of the place we booked for the reception.&nbsp; It's called O &amp; L Nofziger Gardens.&nbsp; Basically it's the home of LaVerne Nofziger, who has a large piece of property, a penchant for gardening, and an entrepreneurial nature.&nbsp; There are white lights strung around the oak grove, and swings hung from some of the trees. There's not a certain time we have to leave, candles and lanterns are ok, tents are ok, firepits are ok (thought it might be good in case it gets chilly), fireworks are ok as long as they're not close to the field that borders the site (which will probably be drying out by then). The place comes with 200 chairs and 12 round tables and table linens, which is one of the main reasons why we chose it instead of a cheaper site that doesn't have that stuff (chairs rent for about $1.50 apiece, and tables $7.&nbsp; I have no idea how much linens cost). It has an outdoor kitchen (tent) with 3 fridges, water, electricity, and a stove. There is an adjacent field where everyone can park. It has a dance floor of sorts (basically just a covered platform, nothing too special to look at but maybe we can dress it up). And it has horseshoes, hawt dawg! <br /><br />Anyway...the site is pretty. There are gardens up front, but the grove will mostly be what we make it....it's basically just a large&nbsp;space in a pretty setting. &nbsp;I am thinking that different types of old fashioned lanterns would be cool to use as centerpieces, since the reception will be in the evening. <br /><br />Anyway.

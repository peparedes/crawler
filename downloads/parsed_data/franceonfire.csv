"event","hey. ive done absolutely nothing today! well i heard that i might be going to florida to see my dad in august. that would be great because i really just wanna have a break from my life now. its not that im sad or ""emo"" or any crap like that because im the complete opposite of that. there's just stuff that irritates me and it would be awesome to get away from that stuff for a bit. and i'll just ignore my dad and his new ""family"" for the most part so i can get the best out of it. i dont feel the need to explain why i am irritated because i like things the way they are right now. minus the irritating stuff. so DONT ask me to tell you whats irritating because because im not gonna say a word. 
im planning on seeing spiderman2 next week since i probably have plans this weekend. and im probably going to the burnouts in worcester tomorrow and if no one comes with me i'll have to go with my parents and that wold suck a lot so if you a friend of mine, PLEASE, PLEASE come with me. thank you. bye"

"event","<P>its Halloween tomorrow and i have NO clue what im doing. Brooke invited me to go trick-or-treating with her and her friends . .so maybe. </P>
<P>i just pealed a ton of potatoes with rachel . .i feel like a slave. my hands smell starchy, gross. </P>
<P>im going to Kurts in a few hours to have band rehearsal. we have our show on the 26 . . im not sure if were gonna have enough stuff. i really really REALLY hope we do. im scared as hell that we wont or that people are gonna hate what we've written. especially what i've written. if they hate it i'll be so sad b/c those are my emotions in there and my thought process . .ugh, i'll just cry and they'll feel bad. </P>
<P>i got new icons last night. they're so pretty!</P>
<P>i read my email from Tyler, they alwasy seem to cheer me up. its nice to know that someone is taking a moment out of their day to write me something. its comforting i think</P>
<P>i feel really empty today. just devoid of every emotion. i have a ton of work to do but i just cant seem to bring myself to do any of it. i need to re-write my reasearch proposal to Mrs. Smith . .damn damn damn.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>and i have to get dressed now b/c im getting picked up in 20. im starting to despise getting dressed. maybe i'll become a nudist and live out my days in a colony of other naked people . . ..but probably not</P>"

ally and i had a rave last night downtown with scarecrows and running and other weird stuff like tht.

i have pops concert (again) today and i hate it. in fact i gotta go get ready b/c i have to be there at 12:15 to set up chairs for like 2 freakin hours. dont come , pops concert is embarrasing. come to out chamber choir festival on thursday, its soooooo much better.

"event","sorry about the rediculously loooong post yersterday , let me sum up. ANDREW, THE LOVE OF MY LIFE, IS IN RECOVERY FROM LUEKEMIA!! and i think i could just die from happiness and relief, i've been smiling and all excited about everything today. it was amazing not thinking about him and how much pain he must have been in. and yeah, i sound idiotic, but i could care less b/c he's amazing.

anna banana and i have the BEST article in the world. its so intense and difficult and amazing. i feel like a real reporter and like im actually being productive. and i got a 42 out of 40 on my reduction. ha ha, i rock.


its been a good good good day. oh and Dr. Byrens doesnt think im dying, yay. no more meds and doctor visits at 8 fucking AM. i was sick of tht and being poked at. no fun. i hate the hospital with a passion.



hmm, sooooooo i heard that Black Eyes Pea's song (my hump?). its so weird, i havent listened to that kinda music in a looooooooooooooooong time,let me tell ya. oh and i heard Gold Digga .. .kayne west can do die for all i care. he bugs me. i think he hates white ppl, and guess what, i base tht on nothing! sound familiar (Bush hates black ppl). no, he hates ignorant assholes like you kayne who spend all their cash on LV vests instead of donating it to the homeless. maybe you hate poor ppl. maybe. i dont like Bush either, but at least he isnt all like ""black ppl hate me . .boo hoo""


idiots like tht need to be put on their own special little island where they can have dumb debates over worthless stuff and fight over nothing. it'll be fun, like a TV show. and we can all watch and laugh at the stupidity of it all. it'll be called ""Idiot Isle"" and we'll all love it"

i just finished Scarlet Letter and it was HORRIBLE! they kill my favorite character and i cried and it was jsut awful for me. completely awful and i wanna KILL hawthorne sooooo much, but hes dead so i cant do much except laugh b/c im alive. bastard. im pissed. Dimmesdal was such and awesom guy and so sweet and loving and then he jsut dies. WTF? who does that, who fucking kills an awesome guy? murr. i should rewerite the last few pages, maybe last chapter, it'd go something like this:


Chillingworth was killed by Dimmesdale and the crazy witch lady b/c no one liked him and he was a jerk. you dont try to kill a priest who is sweet as hell, abandon your wife, and be all sneaky eager boy, no one likes that. ITS NOT COOL. so he dies and everyone is so happy, and at the big town party Dimmesdale tells ppl that he is a sinner with Hester and eveyone is shocked (gasp!!) but its ok b/c they just leave. they steal a pirate ship (ok,there were so pirates at the end, it was so out of place and weird) and sail away and live somewhere random, like Greece or Milan. i dont know yet. but they're happy and Hester doesnt have to wear the letter anymore and Dimmesdale isnt being all self inflictive and innner turmoil-y and Pearl isnt throwing rocks at seagulls anymore (who the hell does that??)and acting mean to Hester. She chills out basically, fuck yeah. and we all live fucking happily ever after and its so sweet that it makes you ill. THE END

im trying not to let certain things bother me right now. im trying to get on with my life. im sick of feeling hurt and wretched. im thinking of asking my mom for therapy, but im afraid she'll laugh in my face and tell me im not depressed. im not depressed, im just . . .wrong. i feel wrong sometimes. i get sad about things alot then cnat shake it for like a week. plus i have all my personal garbage that we all seem to have nad be able to carry. im just a little weaker than most i think. nothing huge, just need to build up some muscle, if you catch my drift"

i got in 2 hours of sleep last night. not even that. 1 and a half. too much caffine . .so i read and read and journal wrote and just sat in bed composing a letter that i'll never ever write and thinking about things that will never ever happen . .but it was nice to pretend for a bit. yeah, im weird . . sue me.

finally rented PUMPKIN . . it was amazing. but i love Christina Ricci, so im biased. far as im concerned all her films are fab. so yeah . .see tht one and PROZAV NATION b/c i love them and hope u will too. 

god, the way the mother and father act (in Prozac Nation) is just like my parents. in fact tht whole movie hit so close to home, except tht im not on prozac,im not wanting to end my life, and im not having sex.basically, im not her . . we just have a similiar life and approach to therapy. it was the home life tht was so similiar to my own too. it scared me a little. watching from a different set of eyes. wonder if mal felt the same. i could never ask her. we barely even talk about it, it just hurts too much. dunno, maybe if u guys saw it, you would think about why people do what they do. its all for a reason. existentialism. tht and its just an amazing piece. i dont know. maybe im just filling up space here. theres so much i want to say about the movie, but i dont know how. i dont have the words to describe it well

ok, so i have finally come to end w/ government. well, actually i came to an end with it about a month or so ago. i dont care, i jsut dont care. its so corrupt and fucked up and i want nothing to do with it at all. we'd be better off starting fresh so people will cease to bitch about stuff that doesnt even eefect them. (stem cell research for example, i know some of my friends will say tht its for 'ethical reason', but it doest realy harm u in any way. what a women chooses to do w/ her fetus is her choice.) and dont call me a fucking liberal b/c i've had it up to here w/ the damn welfare program. if tht make me anti american or an 'anarchist' so be it. im just done

on a lighter note, i' read FIGHT CLUB and found it amazing. its one of my favorite booksthe author is so eloiqunet and  blunt.

You have a wonderful sense of humor
I'm glad they got rid of your moms tumor.

1. me and matt gill were driving along 75, when matt realizes hes only doing 60 so he starts to speed up. well this guy who was going like fucking 85 starts coming up really fast on the jeep that is next to us, going the same speed as matt and I. well instead of going around the jeep to the left lane, which was completely open by the way, he decides to be a big dick and cut in front of matt, and when he did, he lost control of his car, and spun and slammed into the median wall on the freeway. he missed the jeep by like a few inches, and if he would have hit that car, it would have hit me and matt. so while this car is spinning it starts spinning towards us, so matt leisurely puts on his blinker and moves into the next lane to get out of the way. 
FUCKING KARMA MAN! so me and matt kept driving along with the jeep he almost hit. the end.

2. me and matt were driving and i seen an advertisement for the movie, "" lets go to prison "" and I say, "" i want to see lets go to prison!"" and matt says, ""what no! bad idea, ill get raped, you wont! but i will.""  I stared at him for a few, and i was thinking what hte fuck?  Well he thought i said, i want to see us go to prison! which is weird because, who says that?

My check was nice. 
Christmas Carol was nice.
Hanging out with everyone was nice.
Tonight I went to Christmas Carol, I was ushering, and oddly enough, so was Jeremy Kucharek, so I got to see him. 
Afterwards I drove my soon to be professor, next semester, and another professor/director to the Cass Cafe. Then I took Jeremy to his apartment to see where he lived. 
Christmas Carol was good, I enjoyed it very much. 
Then of course, I went to Coney! Some kind of ritual I'm sensing, and I seen people (and by people I mean a person) whom I didn't want to run into. =( 


Apparently, next week is my last week of school, sort of? So much for shop hours, I failed that class. Well... not really but I could have gotten a 4.0. OH WELL!!! 




I really want to see certain people on break, but they'll be too busy, how much you want to bet? 





love me.

A. My hands have not been sweaty these past few days, which for those of you who know me, thats weird. 

B. Do you wake up and see the snow, and the first thing you think, ""Hey, I want some Coldstone?"" NO? Well apparently all of America wants Coldstone when it's fucking freezing outside.

C. School is stupid. 

D. I should probably keep my mouth shut, and the truth behind closed doors because it's a making people not want to talk to me, I think. So I've decided it's not cool to tell the truth anymore, but just to pretend the truth doesn't exist. 

E. I cannot stand how for away I am from Tad. Has anyone invented the Teleport yet? If so, I will flash you my nipple real fast, but you can't tell anyone. 

F. I'm sick still. I'm afraid im ruining my vocal cards. Whoa, wouldn't that suck? 

G. I cannot wait to move downtown and make more friends. 

H. Dr. Phil called some girl a ""Dirty old crack whore"" the other day on his show. 

I. I sort of have forgotten to memorize my lines for my Tuesday Night Class, so I will be memorizing them an hour before the class begins, because that's how I roll. 

J. I was offered $3,000 dollars for sex the other day downtown, and I turned down the offer. Now I am on wikipedia.com for being the stupidest bitch ever.
Three thousand dollars!

this is what it would consist of we decided:

Joe would always be yelling at me because i would have a lot of boys over, and he would get sick of it. and he would have a hard time keeping track of all the guys, so he would name them one name, BRAD. We have a very good explanation for the name Brad, and he said thats the name he would have to use.

and while joe is yelling at me because he cant keep my friends straight, i would be screaming at him to stop smoking in our non-smoking dorm. 
he would be at the window, with it cracked saying, ""shut the fuck up bitch its fucking cracked, whore."" 
and we would smell like cigarettes. eww.

we both like different pop, so we couldnt share pop, that would keep up space and that would cause a big fight over whose pop would take up the shelf space in our cool mini fridge.

he also spends more time on his hair then i do. that would be a problem. so basically we decided it would be like a sitcom and we would both be completely miserable, but love every minute of living with the other asshole bitch. 

that would be my life if i moved in with my friend Joseph Herpers."

Me 

I am not the person who is singing 
I am the silent one inside 
I am not the one who laughs at people's jokes 
I just pacify their egos 
I am not my house, my car, my songs 
They are only just stops along my way 
I am like the winter 
I'm a dark cold female 
With a golden ring of wisdom in my cave 

CHORUS: 

And it is me who is my enemy 
Me who beats me up 
Me who makes the monsters 
Me who strips my confidence 

I am carrying my voice 
I am carrying my heart 
I am carrying my rhythmn 
I am carrying my prayers 
But you can't kill my spirit 
It's soaring and it's strong 
Like a mountain 
I'll go on and on 
But when my wings are folded 
The brightly colored moth 
Blends into the dirt into the ground 

Chorus 

And it's me who's too weak 
And it's me who's too shy 
To ask for the thing i love 
And it's me who's too weak 
And it's me who's too shy 
To ask for the thing i love 
That I love 

I am walking on the bridge 
I am over the water 
And I'm scared as hell 
But I know there's something better 
Yes I know there's something 
Yes I know, i know, yes i know 

That I love  

But it's me 
And it's me 
But it's me"

"event","so i have made some advances with my new sport, it will not be on ice. it will be on rollerblades. the court itself will be slightly larger than an indoor soccer field, maybe the size of an indoor football field. (well atleast the one in soccer city). there will be end zones on both ends, which if scored here, the point would be worth less, if you scored into the slightly larger than a hockey net, but smaller than a soccer net. (by throwing the frisbee past the goalie, of that paticular net.) there will be two nets on each side, one goalie. eight people on each team, including the goalie. the goalie will also be on foot. not on rollerblades. 

currently i am having a designer, design the field. and also having an advertising manager step in. its actually the same company. the TADLEEWOJDYLA company. i hear he's pretty damn good, at pretty much everything, so i trust him with my new sport. 


have any suggestions for him?

so i was thinking while i was making a cake today, (which by the way turned out very shitty,) and something hit me.... i want to invent a new sport. 
a completely different new sport, designed to look more bad ass then football but require much more thinking. Maybe through in some ice, maybe a frisbee, and a javelin. im not sure, im still putting it together. i dont know what to name it yet, or what the rules are. but it will probably be the most bad ace game in the whole world, next to extreme chess.

"event","who votes some feelings shouldn't exist? 

I understand some feelings should like the feeling of guilt or remorse. or what not. Otherwise we would go around killing eachother.

But sometimes feelings like, love, jealous, hate, or sadness, they should not exist. Yes that would be a life without love. but if we didn't know love, or even having feelings for someone existed, then we would probably be a lot happier. Jealousy would not really play a role anymore. 

Don't get me wrong, love is great and everything. But sometimes it hurts more than anything. And if you think about it, it's really quite an interesting and confusing thing to feel. I mean, how does one know they are in love, or that they are not in love with someone?
No one has ever defined love. What if, what you are feeling was only the tip of the iceberg. Maybe that's why marriage now usually ends up in divorce. What we define as love, maybe really isn't love. Maybe it's just what we define as having feelings for someone. 

So how do you explain the feelings you get when you are with someone? Maybe what you are feeling, is the feeling of thinking this could mean something. How do you know the difference between excitement and ""love?""
How do you fall in love? And when you do how do you know? I think the world in general has really warped the meaning of love and what it is. People watch movies and think its this wonderful feeling, and its perfect. It is really isn't. The love that exists in the real world today, is hard, and hurtful. You really have to work at it. 

But then is there a point, where you stop working at it? and thats the question that raises questions about love. CAN love be hurtful? or is that not love anymore? 

No one can define love. I think if everyone stopped trying to define it, the real definition and meaning would show. But as long as we do, there's going to be hate and tears. 


So, now, I ask you, do you believe love can only exist one way and not have different meanings or different levels? And I still vote some feelings should not exist. Or atleast until Other feelings aren't along side of it, swaying it or pulling it towards other negative feelings."

"event","All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye

But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn
The taxi's waitin', he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go

I'm ...

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I'll tell you now, they don't mean a thing

Every place I go, I think of you
Every song I sing, I sing for you
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, oh, let me kiss you
And close your eyes and I'll be on my way

Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times that I won't have to say ...

Oh, kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go

And I'm leaving on a jet plane
I don't know when I'll be back again
Oh, babe, I hate to go"

"event","so i still am  a State fan. But i must admit Ann Arbor is nice, and i had a good time. 
i like the way lansing is set up, because there is too much town in AA, but AA has way better dorm rooms. you can move and breathe.

i had a great time cuz i was with really sweet people. <33 I can't wait to go next weekend. i dont know if i can wait that long, but i must.

"event","ive been jerked around for so long by someone who really hasn't cared about me in a while. people tried to tell me, and i ignored them, because i believed him and believed in us. but its been a lie. a pathetic attempt to keep me, when i wasn't wanted. no wonder everything has felt different, somebody must have been trying to tell me i was'nt needed or didnt matter. why didnt i see it? to bad it had to take something like this, something so hurtful, to figure it out. 
im so glad i have friends like bruno and julia. people who care, and will watch out for me, because one of the most important people to me obviously didnt give two shits about me. say what you want, think what you want, but know, im not making any of this up. ive been treated like a friend and a sex toy. wtf. thats all i was, and i see that now thats so sad, i thought he was perfect. 
but he lied. 
every boy lies.






its going to be such a relief, and an odd feeling to be happy, and not feel like shit all the time. i wanna smile, and from now on thats all im going to do. im not going to let anything get me down. im going to go for what i want, truly. and im never going to want someone who hurts me, or doesnt want me back. 



what a fucking god damn waste of time....








i dont work friday or saturday, i need happiness, anyone?"

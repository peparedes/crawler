"event","So, basically I'm just frustrated with everything.  I think it's gonna get so much better when I leave again for school.  -sigh-

I'm so sick of friends not being friends.  I'm so sick of my family being terrible to live with.  I'm just really tired of all that I have to put up with right now.

When I go to school again, I can focus on school or my friends there.  My friends from high school are proving themselves...well, they just don't really act like friends.  I'm sick of it.  But I'm talking in circles.

I've been waiting for about three hours for a ride.  Not to mention I have to be home by 2, and it's midnight.  This whole thing is retarded.

I really need a cigarette.

EMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOO,
Micheal."

"event","So.  I haven't updated in a while.  Hm.

Well, I've been busy, that's for sure.  My parents randomly thought it would be a great idea to give me a curfew after like two or three years of coming home around 4 or 5 in the morning.  Now I gotta be home at 2...which is just totally stupid.  So, that pisses me off.

Lately, I've just been somking an insane amount of weed and just drinking like crazy, too.  When I think about it, I wonder if it's because I'm just really depressed.  I don't know if I am or not, but it kinda feels like it.  It's not as bad as it was during school, so, I'm not too worried about being in a bad mood.

But I've had reason to be in a bad mood, though.  People are just...too much.  I exploded at Chris today just because I was getting really really pissed off.  Basically, I've been haning with Chelsea and Goyette lately, and I can't stand to see them making out like every five seconds.  It just makes me in a really bad mood due to my lack of a girlfriend...

Also, they totally use me, I think.  I'm not sure whether they know they're doing it or not, but they really, really are.  When I drive fucking half an hour to Chelsea's house, and I don't get any gas money from them, really ever, it pisses me off.  I'm running those two everywhere and then they don't even pay attention to me when I'm around the two of them.

I'm rambling.  But I don't really have anything IMPORTANT to talk about besides my little girl-like tiffs with people and my emo-ness.

MATT AND/OR BROOK CALL ME TOMORROW...

Oh, wait, you guys have school on Monday...hmm.

Well, night!
Mike."

Tell us the title of the next twenty songs that show up (with their musicians), no matter how embarrassing. That's right, no skipping that Carpenters, (Fuck the Carpenters...), tune that will totally destroy your hip credibility. It's time for total musical honesty.<br /><br />5. If you get the same artist twice, you may skip the second (or third, (Which means including the first Human Drama tune...), or etc.) occurrences. You don't have to, but since randomness could mean you end up with a list of ten songs with five artists, you can if you'd like.<br /><br />6. Tell a story about each song.<br /><br /></strong>1. 'I'm Ready, I Am.'&nbsp; -The Format<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This song really reminds me of my girlfriends.&nbsp; Not the love-y kind.&nbsp; The friend kind.&nbsp; Katie and Justine got me really hooked on The Format and I love them for it.&nbsp; It also reminds me of a girl I used to work with.&nbsp; Liz, you never DID give me that Format Mix....<br /><br />2.&nbsp; 'Valentine'&nbsp; -Old 97's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This reminds me of Elizabeth.&nbsp; Ex-girlfriend.&nbsp; I remember she told me I would hate Old 97's 'cause it was 'too folk-ish'.&nbsp; I loved it, thought, and still do.&nbsp; For some reason this song really reminds me of my awesome summer romance.<br /><br />3. 'At The End Of The Day' &nbsp; -Les Miserables<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um.&nbsp; Basically, I love Les Mis.&nbsp; We're doing a&nbsp; little kinda concert of Les Mis songs and I put this on here because I'm more likely going to be Jean Valjean, the main character.&nbsp; So, I'm listening a lot to get used to the songs.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; 'Dude Looks Like a Lady'&nbsp; - Aerosmith<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!&nbsp; Oh my God, this was so funny.&nbsp; I downloaded this song for a senior video we did for Homecoming.&nbsp; My friend Craig dressed up in a dress for one scene and we played it for when he made his STUNNING entrence.&nbsp; You're a hottie, Craig.<br /><br />5. 'Timebomb'&nbsp; -Old 97's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, Elize.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; I just love this song because it really gets me in a good mood, but I don't really think it's a happy song.&nbsp; It IS fast, though.&nbsp; So, it totally gets me pumped.&nbsp; XP<br /><br />6. 'There's A Fire'&nbsp; -Ok Go<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh my God, Elize.&nbsp; You make up so much of this list.&nbsp; But, yeah.&nbsp; She got me hooked on Ok Go.&nbsp; I was going to go to a concert for them a little while ago, but there was all that snow.&nbsp; I bought an album, though.&nbsp; So, I could go see them and no some songs.&nbsp; This one isn't my favorite, but what're ya' gonna do?<br /><br />7. 'Am I Understood?'&nbsp; -Reliant K<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brian Anderson.&nbsp; We used to listen to this in his basement back in the day.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; But, yeah.&nbsp; He had like three differnt versions of this CD or something, so he gave me one.&nbsp; I loved/love it.&nbsp; It's so good.&nbsp; This song is the perfect song for the awkward boy and the girl he loves.&nbsp; It's gotten a little bit down sometimes just because it's happened to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most specific time I can think of was when I had a HUGE crush on Katie Lankau.&nbsp; I told her I liked her and bent over to kiss her, and I forgot my seatbelt was on, and i missed.&nbsp; So, she just gave me a hug.&nbsp; Most embarrassing moment ever, I think.<br /><br />8.&nbsp; 'Oppenheimer'&nbsp; -Old 97's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, this one actually was more my girlfriends.&nbsp; I stole a CD of Katie's, and this song was on it.&nbsp; I've been in love with it forever since.<br /><br />9.&nbsp; 'Don't Ask Me'&nbsp; -Ok Go<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know that one friend who was there for you and you were really good friends with them, and then you stopped talking?&nbsp; Well, when they come back and ask you how you've been, check to see if they are just trying to get something from you.&nbsp; Because if you listen to this song, that's what you'll be wondering.<br /><br />10.&nbsp; '11:11'&nbsp; -The All-American Rejects<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Um.&nbsp; I love the AAR.&nbsp; They are like my favorite band ever.&nbsp; I waited for weeks for this new album to come out, and when I did, I got it like the first day.&nbsp; I used to hang out with my friend from work, Molly.&nbsp; She was so much fun!!!!&nbsp; We listened to this in her car, and we went to an AAR concert.&nbsp; I wanted them to play this song, but it's not their BEST song on the album, so they didn't play it.&nbsp; Sad.<br /><br />11.&nbsp; 'Question'&nbsp; -Old 97's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This song was is the most adorable song ever written.&nbsp; Find it NOW and listen to it.&nbsp; I love it so much.&nbsp; It reminds me of Elize.&nbsp; We would sing it together in her car...while we were....talking.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; And sometimes I would sing it, and she would tell me I kinda sounded like him.&nbsp; I still think I don't sound anything like him.<br /><br />12.&nbsp; 'Sonny'&nbsp; -A New Found Glory<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brian Anderson, again.&nbsp; He used to drive him mom's car around and we would listen to them, this song included.&nbsp; Craig and I often listen to this in his car, too.&nbsp; Fun times.<br /><br />13.&nbsp; 'Take Your Momma'&nbsp; -Scissor Sisters<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gilli!!!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Um.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have a lot of parties at my house over the summers, and she would always play this song.&nbsp; I hated it at first, and now I LOVE it.&nbsp; I love this band now.&nbsp; Tonight Justine and I actually were singing (badly) along to this song and dancing in the car.&nbsp; I love you, Justine.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; We would make a REALLY bad band.&nbsp; Love ya'.<br /><br />14.&nbsp; 'Standard Lines'&nbsp; -Dashboard Confessional<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This song brings back some memories.&nbsp; Um.&nbsp; This song really reminds me of Rachel.&nbsp; Her sister took me, her, and Katie to a Dashboard concert at Summerfest.&nbsp; It was SO much fun.&nbsp;lol.&nbsp; No body seems to remember that night very well, but I will always remember it for some reason or another.&nbsp; If they played this song or not, I can't really recall, but it reminds me of that night.<br /><br />15.&nbsp; 'Brat Pack'&nbsp; -Rocket Summer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!1111one&nbsp; This is our song.&nbsp; Kaite, Justine, Rachel, and I are all just a brat pack, we're always kickin' back.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; I love you guys.&nbsp; This song is our's.&nbsp; No on else can have it.&nbsp; It totally describes us.&nbsp; I love this song and it can always cheer me up.<br /><br />16.&nbsp; 'One Day More'&nbsp; -Les Mis<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, for school.&nbsp; But I really like this song just because all the characters have a part in it and it's just so beautiful.&nbsp; I like it a whole lot.&nbsp; This gong reminds me of my free period last year with Brooke, Ama, and Liz.&nbsp; We had a REALLY good time.&nbsp; But, yeah.&nbsp; We would sing musical songs a lot.&nbsp; I believe this was one of them, and if it wasn't oh well.&nbsp; It reminds me of that, so there.<br /><br />17.&nbsp; ""C-C-Cinnamon Lips'&nbsp; -Ok Go<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This song just reminds me of Justine because she likes Cinnamon gum.&nbsp; Enough said, I guess.<br /><br />18.&nbsp; 'Tune Out'&nbsp; -The Format<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I LOVE this song.&nbsp; It just reminds me of summer drives in the car with close friends while smoking a cigarette.&nbsp; This reminds me of Katie and Rachel.&nbsp; Not really a Justine song...sorry, Justine.&nbsp; Brooke also comes to mind.&nbsp; We would go out and smoke during the play.&nbsp; For some reason that comes to mind when I hear this song.&nbsp; Love you, Brooke.&nbsp; You're my play, Stage Manager buddie!!! &lt;3<br /><br />19.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Can You Hear the People Sing?' '&nbsp; -Les Mis<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same deal.&nbsp; This song just gives me that little boost that I need when I just don't think I could live past another day.&nbsp; Even though it's a kinda depressing song....yeah.&nbsp; I don't make any sense, do I?&nbsp; Oh well.<br /><br />20.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The Internet Is For Porn'&nbsp; -Avenue Q<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matt!!!&nbsp; I was wondering if there would be a song on here that reminded me of you.&nbsp; He gave me all of the songs from like a million musicals.&nbsp; Avenue Q&nbsp;was one of them.&nbsp; It's a&nbsp; really funny song and I love him for giving it to me.&nbsp; Also, this song reminds me of Sameer and Craig.&nbsp; They had this site where they sing the song with characters from World of Warcraft.&nbsp; It was kinda funny.&nbsp;&nbsp; heh.&nbsp; ALSO, during Our Town practice, we were just painting stuff balck...lame....and Eva was asking me if I've seen this musical.&nbsp; I told her I hadn't, but I'd heard all the songs and seen parts online.&nbsp; She asked me about the puppet sex.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; Funny.&nbsp; Rose and them gave me DIRTY looks.&nbsp; It was SO funny."

"event","<P>I just watched a movie. It's one of my favorites. The ending is disgustingly cute and happy, but it always makes me depressed. It's called 'What Dreams May Come'. I'm going to make a cut so I don't give away the ending to anyone who wants to see it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""What Dreams Are In Store For Me?""> </P>
<P>In this movie...a man has two kids and a wife that he loves more than anything in the entire world.&nbsp; It's hard to express how much he loves them in a LiveJournal.&nbsp; His wife and him are one.&nbsp; They are true soul-mates.&nbsp; He is a child-doctor.&nbsp; She restores paintings and also paints her own works.&nbsp; ((They're really beautiful.))</P>
<P>So, in the movie, the children of this man die in a car accident.&nbsp; The children's mother feels responsible because she was suppose to drive her kids to school, but never did because she had a meeting come up.&nbsp; She tried to kill herself.</P>
<P>She's admitted to an institute.&nbsp; She wants a divorce, but not really.&nbsp; She doesn't want to be reminded of her kids through him, but she loves him more than anything.&nbsp; So, they end up working it out.&nbsp; Four years pass and she still is a bit unstable, but she is getting better.&nbsp; He is fine.&nbsp; Or acts like he is.&nbsp; She has a panic attack because some paintings didn't arrive.&nbsp; He says he will pick them up.&nbsp; He goes and gets the paintings and there is a car crash.&nbsp; He goes out to help people because he's a doctor.&nbsp; A car flies off of another and lands, basically, on top of him.&nbsp; He dies.&nbsp; He goes to heaven and his heaven is her paintings.&nbsp; She kills herself and goes to hell, but not a really bad hell.&nbsp; She just doesn't realize she killed herself and whatever.&nbsp; She is in denial for the rest of eternity, but he goes to save her...</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I just hope that there will be someone like that in my life when I'm older.&nbsp; Someone who will go into the pits of hell to find me...anyway.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>He saves her.&nbsp; And apparently, you can choose to be reborn or not and they chose to be reborn.&nbsp; They meet again in their next life and fall in love as little kids.&nbsp; It was the cutest sort of ending there is.&nbsp; It just made me depressed.&nbsp; Would anyone ever do that for me?</P>"

See it, not even kidding.  Anything that can scare me is worth seeing.

Sameer drove me home along with Alyssa and chris.  We all talked about scary shit.  Ghosts, Gjins(sp?), whatever.  Alyssa didn't want any part of the conversation, but chris talked about seeing some picture that was scary.  Eventually we all scared ourselves.  Woo.

"event","Well, the play continues.  It sounds as though everyone is discontent with it thus far.  Understandable.  I really hate it, too.  I feel so...inferior.  I watch Elizabeth act and wow...I'm so jealous.  Chris and Alison have such awesome chemistry up on stage that it's just...awesome.  I can't stand feeling like I'm not good enough.  Sam points me out and tells me in front of the ENTIRE cast how I'm not into my character and I'm not angry enough...jerk.  I'm not an angry person.  Bitter, yes.  Hateful, sometimes, but not angry.  I may not be able to act, but at least I know my lines...Grr.  I really, really wanna try out for the musical in the spring, but in between being inept/retarted/without-acting-skill and Sam, I dunno.

Um...OH!  Alison Kelly ((sorry if I spelt your name wrong ^^;)) and Cuyler Moon stopped by the school today.  At first I was like...just walk by.  They don't really know me outside of the play and musical...*shrug*  But I did stop and I'm glad.  Cuyler told me he reads this stupid journal.  I was like...aww...I didn't think anyone read it.  ;_;  It made me feel better.  But yeah, they were going around harrassing students.  It's awesome to see them again, doing well.  :)

Anywho...Homecoming.  I TPed about eight or nine houses.  Woo.  That was the best part, I think.  Maybe Homecoming dinner.  That was fun, too.  Otherwise, it was a total bust.  Crappy in every way.

I'm madly in love with my Utopian Lit and Humane Letters classes.  They are so fun. <3

My cynical side shows terribly during Humane Letters.  We read philosophy and discuss.  I always say the person is a quack and people are naturally evil.  Everyone disagrees.  Thus is life.

...what else.  OH!!!! The good 'ol Chaz ((Mr. Gerwells)).  I'm sorry to everyone that likes him, but he's totally insane. I mean...he started yelling because he thought someone said 'Stop sucking up.'  I tried thinking of another way of saying it, but no luck.  I realized that it's just common language now.  *shrug* Anyway, he called my house and told my parents I don't care about school or life.  He says that I didn't show up for a meeting with him after school, but he sat waiting for me.  He lied.  I saw him, in fact and he was working with some other students and was gone maybe...15 minutes later.  He's right, I didn't show up to his meeting, but I had play practice.  When I actually wanna go to play practice with Sam over anything else, that's saying something.

Have you ever really hated someone?  Now I do.  It's horrible, but good at the same time.  It's kinda unnerving.

I've been an ass to Deb lately.  Just signing off because my mom comes and yells at me or my Internet starts acting up.  Not nice.

Justin called me and asked for help with his paper.  He's in college.  I felt so awesome.  He's a nice guy.  He says he's getting my a Christmas present.  I told him to forget about it.

I'm jealous of way to many people at once.  If I were to be struck down right now by God Himself, I would go straight to hell.  Way to much envy in my life."

Brooke wrote this paper for Lit. She's getting a lot of crap about it and I think that's really stupid.  She just wrote what she wanted to.  Even if it IS about killing baby seals.  It doesn't make a difference.  People are so judgmental.

Utopian Lit is so fun.  I love it.  Just constant debate and reading.  My kinda thing.  Econ, I'm failing...I hate that class.  I just don't think the right way for it.  I'm not in the right mindset.  He never is straight-forward either.  Maybe that's because the topic he's teaching isn't straight forward...hm.  Racko got mad at us today.  During Physics, we were goofing off as usual and he got angry.  He told us that we had to start acting professional.  Whatever the hell that means...I don't like Physics either.  *shrug*

Alyssa read my journal and she says she doesn't care that I hate her.  That's alright.  I'm not angry anymore anyway.  She's just...blunt.  I'm not used to it.  She never was nice to me anyway, so I don't know why I expected anything different now.  She always kinda ignored me.  I think she may have just used me for booze.  I still think she's fun to be around and such, but she is blunt.  Blunt to the point of being really rude.  Then again, I was blunt and rude in my last entry, so I suppose I'm a hypocrite. *shrug*

Apparently, everyone wants to start a DDR Club.  I'm approaching it kinda with a ""whatever"" attitude.  I could care less if there's a DDR club, but lots of people want it, so I said I would lend the club my pad.  As long as no one breaks it or anything, of course.

I'm taking Katie to Homecoming. I hope it will be a fun time.  If it turns out to be a flop, which is a big possibility, that's alright, too 'cause it's not unexpected.

"event","Lots has happened.  I just got lazy and didn't post.  Lottsa homework, too, which I should be doing.  

I made a new layout.  You like?  I'm thinking about asking Tea-sama to do a backround for me.  I'll most likely pay her.  I'm not sure.  She mentioned that she hates when friends are like...omgplzmakeabackround!  So, I may not ask.

I've had a lot of homework...in the first three days...yes.  It sucks.  School is fun sometimes, though.  All that book learnin' is good for meh, too.  My favorite class at this point is Utopian Lit.  It's just a debate over a book.  You read...then debate...then read more.  It's fun.  I like it.  All the other classes sort of drag along.  Boring.

To distract me from my school work, I've gotten DDR.  Woo?  I like some of the songs.  Meh.

I had Chris and Rob over for a while.  We were gonna go see Resident Evil 2, but I got us lost, cause I'm a moron.  Then, we came back to my house and Chris and Rob just talked with my mom...I was sitting there, but didn't say much.  It's great to know people come over to talk with my mom instead of me.  :/  Rob discovered he can twist his thumb all the way around.  Chris discovered that he can make his veins bend.  God, that was gross as hell.  Anywho.  Chris left cause he ""needed sleep.""  Rob took him home and came back.  He went online and I played DDR.  Woo...he needed to talk with people...so I just let him.  People never really wanna talk to me about that stuff anywho.  Cept Deb.  Anywho, we then watched Urban legends...or at least I did.  Rob fell asleep right away.  I ended at around 4:30 and I went to sleep and woke up around 11.  Rob left and I worked outside.

I thought a lot today.  Not much else to do when you're outside doing manual labor crap.  It just made me sad...so I stopped and layed in the middle of the island I was weedwacking.  I took my shirt off and used it as a pillow and dozed for about 15 minutes.  I woke up...with bugs all over me.  Yeah.  That was gross.  I finished up and felt like I couldn't breathe or walk.  It was so hott out there...and whatever.

Deh."

Then, after all that work, they tell me I can't go to Donnie Darko?  They better let me tomorrow, or else I'm going to have a shit fit.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

Okay...yeah...otherwise, I still need to get my book ordered and such as well as go shopping for clothes.  Yet, school starts the day after tomorrow.  My fucking Dad just HAD to have us work, so I haven't gotten the chance.  If he thinks I'm working tomorrow, he's got another thing comin'.  ITS THE LAST DAY OF SUMMER!!!! I'm not working. Damn the angst!

Um...yeah.  I'm done.  I started playing Silent Hill 3 and I'm already having trouble with it.  I've played for 45 minutes and it's driving me nuts!  Damned mall...can't get out...*mumbles curses*

I'm looking forward to school, but after a week, I'll hate it again.  That's okay, though.  That's what school is: a bittersweet bitch that will eat away at your insides till you die...hm."

"event","I went and saw my shrink today.  She's really nice.  We discussed ways to improve things I wanted to change like grades.  She helped me come up with ideas to find an outlet and lose a little weight, which is what I told her I wanted.  I'm going to be walking my uncle's dogs four times a week now.  Just enough to keep homework priority and staying active.  I'm going on a diet, too.  So, that's on its way.

We also talked about friends today...I'm not sure if I wanna post everything she told me/I told her.  Just because...but what could it hurt?  I told her about just what I was thinking and doing with friends and she said that I'm starting to break away with my guy friends because I've matured faster than they have, so I'm starting to be closer to girls as friends because girls mature faster...or something like that.  Deh.  I'm not sure what that means about me or what I should do, but that's what she told me.

I saw a report on the hostage situation in Russia.  A bomb or something went off in the bobby-trapped school and kids started to escape.  Then, the army blew a hole in the wall of the gym to get hostages out, and instead, it made a bunch of the roof fall in and killed 100+.  They pulled out bodies and such after the fighting was over and put the bodies under blankets and people were going around trying to find their loved ones...it was really sad.  An army representative said that it's not a failure just because there were ""some"" casualties because when the authorities deal with people held hostage by terrorists, they are all considered dead.  All those kids dead.  That's so horrible.  This is yet another reason I'm glad I'm not Russian.

Tyler's bird is so good.  I can just grab him and he won't bite.  He's singing to my music right now.  Teboe tried to eat him the other day, so I smacked him.  He's afraid to go near the birds now.

I just got an invite to Alyssa's surprise birthday party...set for August 25th...last Wednesday.  Woo.

Okay, yesterday I helped put together a desk and two desk chairs.  The desk was a bitch.  Tyler and I put it together and then stood it up...and it fell apart.  Then we realized that we needed to turn these things that hold the screws.  Haha.  Yeah.  Then it was fine, but I got cut really bad on my leg and I didn't know.  I just thought it was a scratch, so I kept working.  Tyler then said, 'Mike...why is my carpet red?'  I looked down and there was all this dried blood running down my leg.  I didn't see it 'cause I was sitting indian-style and the cut was on the other side of my leg.  It didn't stop bleeding for a long while, but now it's fine and Tyler has a nice little desk in his room. 

I'm in the middle of reading a book recommended by Deby.  It's called 'The Book of Atrix Wolfe.' So far, I only like one character, but I'm only on page fourty, so that's alright.  The author's writing style is INSANE!  It's like poetry in prose, as Deb put it.  Which is totally true.  I find it hard to follow once in a while, but that's most likely because I'm half asleep when I read...yeah.  

I left my house for the first time in five days today...yeah.  By house I mean yard, too.  I go outside to read and stuff, but I haven't left the yard in days and I went out and got some gas and went to banks with my mom...woo.

I'm thinking about going on another manga spree.  Getting some stuff I was interested in and some that Deb recommended, but I wanna finish Atrix Wolfe as well as the next book in the Sabriel series.  It's the last one and I really wanna read it.  'Lirael' ended abruptly and said, 'to be continued.'  I was so mad, so I gotta pick that up.

I have to go shopping for clothes soon.  I don't have anything to wear for school...yeah.  I need my school books, too.  Seven more days till school...:gonk:"

"event","I watched a movie till about four this morning.  It's called ""Taking Lives.""  It was about a man who would kill people and steal their identities and he would just live their lives.  It stared Angelina Jolie, who was hot, as usual.  But this movie was stupid as hell.  It was nasty, too.  Lots of dead bodies and Angelina is obsessed with dead bodies.  She has a sex sence that's like 10 minutes longer than it has to be...and um.  It was really stupid.  It did keep me entertained even though I knew who the killer was the moment he came on the screen, so, it did it's job.  Overall rating: 4/20

I may go to Rob's and watch a bunch of movies there."

"event","Forgot:  I saw ""Hero.""  I'm not sure if it's a clone of ""Croutching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" because I never really watched it.  I do know, though, that I enjoyed ""Hero.""  It was very artistic.  The mood was totally ruined by Colin constantly asking what was going on and my mom reading the subtitles for Nathan.  I'm used to reading Naruto subtitles, so it wasn't hard at all to keep up.  It was very unique.  It seemed a little driven by fighting, but it didn't stray from the plot, which is awesome.  Overall rating: 18/20

I also saw ""The Eye"" which is a Chinese film and was pretty good.  It's a horror flick, and it had a sad ending which made it better.  I suppose it would have been scarier had it not been in the middle of the day when I watched it.  Overall Rating: 16/20

""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" was okay.  I liked the first one better.  I don't even know why, but that's how I feel.  It got kinda boring.  I still love Uma and her fighting style. :p  The end...I was angry because you expect this huge fight with Bill...and there isn't.  STUPID AS HELL. Overall Rating: 9/20 (for Uma)

Well, now I gotta make dinner and set up two computers...woo!

I'm thinking about just going on a Naruto downloading SPREEEEE.  Just to get my mind offa things and to have something to read.  Should I? ...I think I should."

Well, we now have two birds...budgies, I think.  Yeah.  We also have a hampster as well as good, ol' Teboe.  I love Teboe.  Good dog.  I'm pushing to get a Ball Python.  I just have to save up some money for it, just $40 to go!  I dunno what I'm going to name it yet, but I already named Nathan's hamspter ((Misha, 'cause it's a RUSSIAN Dwarf Hampster)).  So, I may let him name my new pet. :D  

Anyway, I picked up the Something Corporate CD, ""Sneaking Out of Windows.""  That's what I think it's called anyway.  It's my new favorite.  Yay!  Alyssa will be so proud. :p

Yeah, school is starting soon...dammit.  I still am totally not in the mindset for school.  I barely have started looking at what books I need.  I'm looking forward to it.  I'm just wondering what's in store.  Am I going to apply myself and do well?  Am I gonna fall flat on my face?  WHAT?!  I'm sure everything will work out one way or another.

I'm seeing a shrink.  She's awesome.  I've only met with her once, but I told her everything.  She didn't judge me at all, but maybe that's because she was expecting worse.  I think that's what it is.  She asked a lot about killing myself and doing coke...yeah.  Anyway.  I'm going to see her for a while and see what happens.  We're going to ""Set Goals""  next time, whatever that means.  It kinda sounds like something a teacher would say...like Mrs. Wood....*shiver*"

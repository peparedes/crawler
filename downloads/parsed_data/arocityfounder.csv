"event","to a special someone (you know who you are)

ill never have the heart or nerve to tell you to your face again but i need to let you know so here it goes. i know your hurting, and i know exactly why. i wanna be there with you making sure your ok no matter what. i know you fear m because iof wghat i did to one of your good friends. i need you to know that i like her, shes a cool girl, but its not the same as it is with you. shes cool shes fun, but with you, theres an insane amount of chemisrty. i would never do that  to you, i would be the perfect guy for you. ive been waiting ast the sidelines for a long time hoping youll give me an oppertunity to show you what i have to offer. 

but what im really here to say is that i HATE hwo you say your unwanted, cause believe me, you never are. i dont care what the people at your school think, and i dont care if they think that your unwanted or annoying. i know that i want you, and have for a really long time, and i know that means that you are in fact wanted. i know ive wronged you, and i wouldnt be suprised is you never wanted me and i wouldnt blame you either, i just want you to know that your beautiful, your smart, your funny, your sexy and your just such an unbelivable girl that i am ready to giv just about anything i have to be with you.

ill be there, no matter what. i wont make passes at you, i wont ever hurt you or wrong you. im so glad you found comfort in me as a friend and im perfectly content with things stayng that way. 

bottom line: i want you and i always will. you are NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE unwanted.

-your friend, ryan."

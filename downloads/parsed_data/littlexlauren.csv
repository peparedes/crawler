"event","So far the first month of 2010 has been pretty rollercoaster but I am enjoying every moment of it. There are no words to express how much I love living with Tara. It's so simple. I feel like I don't have to go out of my way with anything, we just get eachother...we help eachother out, we click, we know eachother. It's great.

I feel like I want to be enjoying everything I can. I am working M-F and sometimes weekends, I go to school 2 days a week and I am fully embracing all my friendships lately. I am going to see NFG on Tuesday & I am so excited. I haven't seen them in forever and a bunch of us are going and it just makes me feel like so excited. I dunno. I am just stoked.

I dyed my hair bright red...well the amazing Brandee Lamb did it...and it's AMAZEBALLS. I love it so much. I re-pierced my lip and I missed it a lot. I am going to pierce my nose within the month, excited for that too. I just like having the freedom to do what I want without someone on my back all the time. And these little mods are cheaper than tattoos (which I really want) haha.

I just felt like writing. I am in a good mood right now. I just found out livelavalive (Mitchell Davis & Kyle Sibert) are coming to SoFla for a live show. I got my ticket, I am so stoked. It made my year =) 

I hope everyone is having a great 2010 so far. Enjoy every moment, every day, every second. <3"

"event","I am currently sitting on hold with Sallie Mae. Apparently my loan approval went through on December 18 and BC was SUPPOSED to e-mail me to tell me to do the next stop. However comma they did not! So I went to the school and waited for 3 hours in the financial aid office and when I finally saw an advisor, they said ""Oh yea, that went through over 2 weeks ago."" Ugh. So now I need to get my log-in info sorted out and then do an e-signature and then HOPEFULLY the loan will go through and my classes will be all good for this semester. I start tomorrow and I am excited and not at the same time. I only have math and Psych this semester and it should be fun but let's see. This time around I need to keep up and not stop going to school anymore. I want to be at the FAU campus very soon and want my social work degree to be in full force. That is my goal for 2010.

Oh yea, HAPPY 2010 kids! This year will be my year, I feel it. I have so much to accomplish and take care of but I know with time and preparation, I can do it. I am an adult and I am responsible and here comes life so here I go =)

So I went on my first real date since Cory and I broke up the other night and I must say, it was really nice. His name was John and he's my age and he's super funny and cool and has a lot of history but is so intriguing and really down to earth. It went well but there's always bumps in the roads that you don't see. Hopefully I will spend time with him again cause he was sweet. If not, c'est la vie.

I want to do so much with my life at the moment but so little as well. Who knows what's going to happen but all I know is I want to be happy as much as I can.

I am determined to start going to more shows this year if it kills me! I miss being able to sit back and enjoy the music that makes me who I am. NFG is coming with Saves The Day and HelloGoodbye in February and I am buying my tickets for it like asap. I miss it all so much.

Anyways, I am out kiddies. I need to e-sign this loan so it can go through and my financials are over for this damn semester! Bye!

"event","I am sitting at work watching Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I remember when this book came out and how excited I was to run back home and read it asap. I finished it in 2 days I believe. It makes me sad to think this series is ending soon. I was so sad when the books ended two years ago but now within the next 2 years, it's all over. I've been reading Harry Potter since I was 12-13 and to think it's been apart of my life for a decade now and soon it will be done makes me sad. But it makes me happy that I am 23 and I still can hold onto my youth like this. I am EXTREMELY stoked for the Islands of Adventure Wizarding World of Harry Potter. I think I will buy an annual pass to Universal for this next year once it opens. It will totally be worth it. Anyways, enough of that.

It is December 18 and it is the end of 2009. I cannot believe this year is over. This had to have been the fastest year that passed. I have been through so much this year, I can't even begin to explain. I didn't go to school for the last half of the year because of my work schedule. I am still a nanny/personal assistant and I love it very much. It works perfectly with any other schedules I wish to make and it's great. I don't even really consider it a job but I must say it is since I get paid for what I do haha. I am going back to school in January and I am not stopping until I graduate. I want to get my degree and live my dream of moving to New York and just enjoying life =)

This year has had a lot of ups and downs but I have taken them all with a smile and kept pushing. I am no longer a child that will whine and cry about everything. I am an adult and I must roll with the punches and realize that life is unpredictable. I can only seize the day and live for it like no other, which I feel I have been doing very well the last half of the year.

I got out of my first real relationship this year and it killed me. I loved Cory with all my heart but sometimes you just see things differently and I knew we weren't meant to be together anymore in that sort of way. I do still talk to him frequently and I do love him...just not in that way anymore. I think we get along better as friends anyway. I traveled a lot more than I have traveled in a long time. In March I went to Virginia to visit my biffle Tara for a weekend and it was worth every penny. In July, .333 (me Tara & Ash) took over New York for 6 days and it was one of the best trips I have ever been on. New York is where my heart is. I feel nothing but whole when I am there and this trip made me realize that is where I need to be once I am done with school. Then in October I went to LA with Ash & Kristin to visit my Niki!!! It was one of the most memorable experiences I have ever had. California is a magical place. All you Floridians who say it is like Florida with mountains, oh boy, you are seriously mistaken. It is much much more. I had such an amazing time out there and I think that trip changed my life completely. In between those major trips, I went to Orlando, Tampa, Tallahassee and many other places in Florida. All well worth it. I moved 3 times in the last year and everytime it was worth all the sweat and trouble that went into it. I lived with an amazing mother who treated me as her own (thanks Liamom), I moved in with my other half and for that month in the apartment, we owned South Florida (and tons of guys haha) and then her father and step mom took us both in and we lived it up there. Now I moved into my own apartment with my sister Tara. I cannot express how free I feel when I wake up and I know it's my place. I am not paying rent and am a full-fledged adult. I love it. Plus, you can't beat waking up knowing you have one of the most trust-worthy and amazing people to always be there for you. And we have the cutest dog ever Beast aka Spikey D so it's pure bliss. I wake up everyday with a smile on my face and it sticks throughout most of the day now =)

I got two tattoos this year that are probably the most meaningful tattoos I have ever gotten. I got a Kurt Halsey piece on my foot. It is a bird with headphones on and at the end of the headphones cord are my fathers initials SM. I have ALWAYS wanted a tattoo in dedication to my father and when I saw this artwork and thought of my father, I knew I had to get it. I like the bird because it makes me feel like my dad flew away but I know he's always hovering over to watch over me and protect me. And the headphones were just a dealbreaker because nothing more than music has gotten me through my father's death and any other hard time I've had in my life. Whenever I look at it, I feel such joy. My father will always be in my heart. As I have grown older, it has been harder for me to cope with his death. When I was younger I guess I never knew what exactly I would be missing out on but as more big things have happened in my life (graduation, colorguard, drum corps, serious boyfriends, moving out on my own) it makes me wish I had my father here to help me. I am strong and I handle it well but there's not a day that goes by that I don't miss him and wish he was here with me. I got that tattoo on Father's Day...it just felt right to get it that day since every year when that day passes I feel incomplete. This helped me fill the whole in my heart just a little more. I also got 'swim' tattooed on my right wrist. One of my biggest heroes and influences over the past 8 years or so has been Andrew McMahon (lead singer of SoCo and Jack's Mannequin). He is just a huge inspiration and his music speaks to me and helps me through so much. He wrote a song called 'Swim'. After he was diagnosed with leukemia, the music he wrote has been so moving. Swim was the last song he wrote for 'The Glass Passenger' and it's about keeping your head above the water and never letting yourself drown and always looking for brighter days even when it seems like you're in your darkest. I saw Andrew do a solo show a few months back and when he performed 'Swim' I just knew I needed that tattooed on me, it was so moving. I got it on my wrist so I can see it all the time and so when I am down or in need of a cheer up, it reminds me to keep on swimming, don't drown. Thank you Andrew McMahon.

I have never felt more grown up and more alive in my life than I have within these past few months. I do everything I wish to do and know that even if there are consequences, they are worth it because life is something precious to be enjoyed. I am extremely content where I am and I will try and be this optimistic and happy as much as possible.

I have no clue what 2010 will bring but I know with my attitude and what I want to accomplish, it will definitely be a hell of a year. Bring it on new decade =)

"event","So much has changed in my life. But it seems like not enough at the same time.

Cory and I are done and I have no clue how to feel. I'm so used to having him there for everything. Now, it's like the past 2 years haven't even existed. Looking at pictures seems like I'm watching a movie because it's so weird that he's not here anymore. I think we were both at fault for a lot of things and I feel like maybe it's better that we're not together now...I just wish it would have all turned out differently. I don't know. I am just hurt and confused. Maybe cause he has a girlfriend already? Yea, that might be it.

It is the summer and I have been doing nothing. I'm barely working which is nice but at the same time weird. I like being busy, takes my mind off things. I have fully moved into Ashley's fathers house and it is AMAZING. It is so carefree here and he is such a positive person. They make Ashley and I feel awesome and motivate us so much. It's a great environment to be around. I can't wait to go back to school in the fall, I feel so lazy not being there now but it would not have scheduled well with work.

I am going to Tampa next weekend to see RENT!!!! And Anthony Rapp & Adam Pascal are playing their original roles which will be PHENOMENAL!!! I seriously cannot believe I am going to be able to see them play Mark & Roger. It's like a dream come true. Then we're spending the weekend there to hang out with Jade and all the Tampa peoples. I am so stoked about it. Then that Wednesday, July 15...me, Tara and Ashley are going to New York for a week together!! SO FUCKING EXCITED!!!! I need this trip so badly. It's gonna be a blast. Pluuuus, Rob Pattinson is filming a movie there right now and we're gonna go stalk the set. It's meant to be, we WILL meet him. So those vacations are gonna be much needed. I also really really wanna go to LA in October. I want to see Jeremy really badly...I miss him like crazy and I've also wanted to go for such a long time now. I would be able to see Heather too and Eric as well. Tickets are wicked cheap right now so maybe I'll plan it.

I have fallen in love with True Blood. It is SUCH a good show. It is sexy and interesting and funny. And the sex scenes...delicious...amazing. It is totally my new obsession. It has also made my infatuation with vampires go into full on LOVE! Amazing.

I have no clue what else to say right now. I just wanted to give an update. Happy 4th kids...I've been sitting around doing nothing and I probably will all night. Not in the best of moods to be out right now. Have fun and be safe!!!!"

Over the time, I put up with a lot because I loved you and I knew in the end we could make it.  Now we are at a crossroads and everytime I feel like we're taking a huge step in the right direction, you regress.  You bring up the past.  Yes, I don't want us to FORGET what happened or act like it never occured but in order for us to make leaps and bounds forward, we can't regress.  We both made mistakes, huge ones...but if we love each other and want it to work, we need to look towards the future and realize how great it could be.  I want us to work more than anything.

"event","Hello all. I really need to update more. I know no one really reads it but it still makes me feel good when I do update. Just a reminder of my life I suppose. Happy 10th birthday LJ!

It's summertime now and I am currently just working a lot. School ended a few weeks ago and I already miss my Sociology teacher. He was the best thing about me attending BCC and I'm sad I won't be able to have him as a teacher again. I am going to BCC next week to get my transcripts and then I am sending in my application for FAU for the fall. I am switching my major to Social Work. I know I said I wanted to do nursing more than anything but the truth is, I don't have the luxury to be a nursing student. I have to work pretty much full-time and finishing school as a nursing major would mean I wouldn't graduate for like another 3-4 years. I need to get a real job and have a salary soon. Plus, I really like Social Work. I wanna get my bachelor's in Social Work and either be an elementary school counselor, a substance abuse program counselor or a therapist at a hospital. Then my final goal is after a few years of work to go back to school part-time and get my masters in Sex Therapy and be a sex therapist. It's what I really want to do and trust me, you can ask my friends, it's what I was born to do, I've realized that. I am happy with that decision. It motivates me a lot.

Cory and I are in a rough patch right now. We're not together but we're trying to work on being together. I love him more than anything and he has taught me to be a better person. I hope in the end it works out because he is who I see forever in. I love you Cory.

I've come to the realization in the past month that I need to write a book. It's pretty much rules women need to live by when it comes to their personal lives--love, friendship, work and other things. It's a great idea actually. I want to write a rule per page and accompanying the rule will be a stick figure picture demonstrating the rule and then on the other side of that page will be a real-life story of mine, my friends or family that relates to that rule. I know I can make it happen. It will be fucking phenomenal. Look out for it soon kids--I feel it in my bones that I can make it happen.

I don't know what else to say really. I think July is going to be a busy month for me and I am somewhat excited about that. I just hope it all works out.

Well, I am gonna go now. Hopefully I'll update again soon.

It's gonna be nice and relaxing to have the house and car to myself the whole week.  They have a treadmill here and some other workout stuff so I will be working out starting tomorrow.  I want to start getting fit again and I am signing up with a personal trainer this week so yay.

I am also going to sign up for piano lessons this week finally.  I am so excited to get back into music and do something I love and am good at.  It's just nice to be starting my resolutions and do something I love.  With my next paycheck, I am paying off my 2 credit cards.  I am so excited to move my credit score up.  Yay!!!

I really want March to come already.  There are alot of things happening in March that is gonna make it an amazing month.  I am seeing Britney Spears with Caro on March 7th.  On March 12th, I am spending the day with Jeremy, my friend from LA.  On March 17th, I am seeing Legally Blonde live with Eric Bouza.  Then March 20-22nd, I am going to Tampa for the colorguard regional and spending the weekend with my lovely BEF Jade Bouza.  Also, let's not forget the most important date in March...the 21st.  Because the amazing Twilight comes out on DVD that day.  I am so stoked.  Seriously, look at all that, it's gonna be an amazing month.  I am so excited.

Other than that, I have had a pretty good first month of the year so far.  I can't believe January is over already.  I've had a good month so far.  I am very routine with my life at the moment.  School, work and Cory pretty much.  It's not bad, I just want some random spontanaiety.  Cory gave me a webcam and I love it because I can chat with Tara everyday and it's free and I can chat with other people away at college and such.  I just can't wait to have all my debt paid off and then I can buy a Macbook and be uber happy.

Just wanted to give a quick update.  I might do that a lot this week since I'll have a lot of free time on my hands.  Later kiddos.

Then I have to make sure he eats, does his hw and whatever chores he has for the day before 3:45.  At 3:45, I take him to his first tutoring session of the day.  I go and pick him back up at 5 and take him to get food and then drop him off at his next tutoring session of the day.  Then I pick him up at 8 and take him home and wait till his parents get home if they aren't already.  It's just so much driving, it wears me out.  I mean, it's great cause I'm getting WAY more hours now with having to pick him up at 8 and such but it sucks cause then I get home and I'm exhausted and most week nights, I can't go see Cory because he goes to bed at like 9:30, so it's pointless to drive over.  More money though, and with having to pay off my debt, I need it!  Haha.

I fixed my classes at BCC, but it still freaks me out.  I have YET to take Anatomy 1 again and I have to take Anatomy 1 AND 2 before I apply for nursing schools, but I can't take them during the summer because they're too difficult.  Which means if I pass them with good grades, I won't be applying to nursing school until fall 2010 to start in winter 2011.  That's SOOOOO far away.  I am sick of feeling incompetent.  I dunno, I am just confused as hell when it comes to school.  I am such a believer in signs in life and I feel like this whole pre-reqs process is happening because maybe I am not meant to be a nurse.  I dunno.  I want to be one more than anything but it's so discouraging.  I want to start getting a salary.  I want to start my life.  I can't keep doing that with getting paid hourly.  I want my damn Volvo.  I just have to sit back and evaluate everything.  I would LOVE to be a nurse more than anything.  I might just transfer to FAU or something, I have to look into all that.

I started re-reading Twilight yesterday.  I am such a nerd.  It's just so passionate in my eyes and I am a huge fan of that.  People could make fun of me all they want, I don't give a fuck.  The truth is, it makes me happy and that's all that should matter.  Plus, it gets me excited about the bffffffff trip to Oregon.  It's gonna be beautiful and breathtaking and such a different experience.  So glad I'm gonna be able to do it.

I miss going to shows a alot.  I mean, it's not the same as when I went to them when I was younger, but I just miss it.  Standing there, singing along, completely immersed in a band.  I need to start going to them again.  Even if it's randomly and even if it's alone.  Just for a release I suppose.

I am just rambling away right now and my boss just got back to the house.  Chat with ya later kiddies.

Which means who knows when I will be taking it (considering I took it during the summer and didn't do so hot, summer term for a class that hard isn't a good option for me).  I am so sick of this damn school.  I am gonna make an appointment with Barry University and Nova for sometime next week.  Barry seems a lot easier to get into and my friend says it is BUUUUT it's also in Miami/Kendall, and we all know how much I hate that area.  I would LOVE more than anything to go to Nova but I don't know if they'll just accept me without the pre-reqs and such.  But I guess that's why an appointment would be fantabulous.  So yea, that will get done to see what my next step will be.  I just know I can't continue this shitty ass service at this shitty ass institution.  Every term it's something new with them, it's fucking old.  They are the reason I left school the first time and I am getting frustrated and I don't wanna be driven out again.  I will fight as much as I have too...I wanna go to school and get my degree ASAP!  Fuck you very much BCC.

Sorry for ranting, I am just so angry.  On a good note, Gossip Girl came back last night haha.  Eff all my friends for getting me addicted to that show, hehe.  Also, I thought I had missed tons of The Office episodes and Grey's.  I missed no episodes of The Office and only one of Grey's (which I have to find online somewhere).  That made me happy considering I felt like I've missed all my TV lately.

I miss Tara and Lia so much already.  No bueno.  Maybe with all this free time now, more trips can be planned?  I have to see.  Trip numero uno is definitely Oregon!  Anyways, gotta jet.  Thank God I am writing more in this, I've been needing to vent for the past like half hour, thank you LJ!!!!!"

I have a few resolutions for the year and am starting them tomorrow and am very excited for them.
1. Have all my debt paid off by the end of the summer
2. Lose as much weight as possible (I'm gonna start with a personal trainer within the next week)
3. Meet Robert Pattinson (yes, this sounds so kiddie but I'm serious, it has to happen...and it will)
4. Learn piano (Something I've always wanted to do and I finally feel like I have the time and motivation to)
5. Travel travel travel...did I mention travel?
6. Write in my LJ way more--at least once a week.

The future already looks so bright.  So many amazing plans for 09, can't wait to start em.  I have to say 2008 blew my mind.  It had a few downs but for the most part, it made me so happy.  I traveled, I tried new things, I kept the most amazing friends ever, and I had the perfect guy right next to me all along.  I continue my pre-reqs for nursing school this semester and hopefully by the end of summer semester I'll be done and can apply in the fall for beginning of 2010.  It sounds so far but the way this year passed, I know it will fly by and the truth is, it's not like I can speed up the process.  If I could, I would...but BCC blows.

Other than that, I am so happy with things lately.  My biffle Tara just visited home for 2 weeks and after not seeing her for 2 years, it was everything I needed during the holiday season.  I missed her so much and miss her a lot right now too but am glad she's so much closer.  Trip to VA soon? I think so!  Cory makes me so damn happy.  I cannot believe it is our 2nd holiday season together.  It makes me smile so much when I think about it.  He has made me grow into such an adult, I love him for it so much.  I love my friends down here and living with Liamom in the Towers household is AMAZING.  I could not love it anymore.

I dunno what else to really say.  It's so hard when you ""catch up"" cause you always feel like there's SO MUCH MORE to say and you just can't get it off your tongue.  Oh well, I guess I'll catch ya on the flipside.

Ten things I wish I could say to ten different people right now.

10. You broke my heart into a million pieces.  I was a mess for 3 years over you.  But I can safely say thank you for putting me through all that--you taught me a lot and it led me to the most amazing man in the world.
9. There are times that I want to throw you into a river--but others that make me feel so thankful for having you in my life.  I just wish you showed that you cared about me more.  You always say it to me and stuff, but when in public, or around other people sometimes, you completely disregard my existence.  It's okay though, I love you so much, I just know it's one of your flaws.
8. I am so glad we have become close again recently.  I feel like I can be the biggest goofball around you.  It's so effortless to be your friend and I love that about you.  You're an amazing person and I can't wait until you get your happy ending.
7. I take you with your flaws..and you have many...but I feel that's what makes me love you a lot too.  I love being around you and talking to you and feeling comfort in knowing that you've had a pretty shitty life like mine too haha.
6. You will never read this probably because you're a baby but you are the angel and light in my life.  I am so proud of how smart you are and how big you're getting.  I have never loved a single human in this world the way I love you.
5. You are probably one of the most real people I have ever met and I love that about you.  I know you will always be honest with me and I don't expect anything less.  Thanks for putting up with my shit over the years...I sometimes don't think I deserve you as a friend.
4. I don't know who I'd be without you in my life.  I can't remember a time that we haven't been uber close and just been there for eachother.  You are a true and genuine person and you will get everything you want and need in life, I promise.  I will ALWAYS defend you and fight for you.
3. We have had the biggest rollercoaster friendship ever, but it's been worth it.  You are the person who has helped me through the worst times of my life.  I have always been able to count on you and you have tried your hardest to never let me down.  You will be there by my side for everything--weddings, births, deaths, anniversaries, birthdays, celebrations...and I will be so pleased with that.
2. You are my sister--no doubt about it.  There is NO ONE who gets me like you do.  I have known you since childhood and look forward to being sisters until we get old and die.  You have the most beautiful heart and personality.  I am proud to say you're my very best friend in the whole world.
1. You changed everything about my life.  I am so thankful for you.  I can't look back at the past year and a half of my life and NOT be completely and utterly blissful for everything.  I love you, my family loves you and all my friends love you.  I couldn't have asked God for anyone more perfect.  We both have our flaws and we bring out the best and worst in eachother but that's why we're together.  I love you so much.

Nine things about myself.

9. I am never 100% happy...only 99.9%.
8. I've never acted my age...and I never will.  Whether it be staying a kid at heart or being too old at times...I love that.
7. I used to be the biggest pushover and I feel like people still treat me that way.  So I will continue being a huge bitch! =)
6. I want to be the most successful person in my family--and I know I will be.
5. I love everything cheesy and kiddy--it makes me happy.
4. I think about my father everyday.  And miss him more and more as the days pass, even though I never show it or really talk about it.
3. I will wish I was in FW05 again probably for the rest of my life.
2. I want to travel the world with Cory.

"event","It pained me so much to hear the awful news yesterday.

I remember when you first moved to Tennessee, we used to talk almost everyday online and we called eachother the best b/f & g/f ever.

I was sad when we drifted but it's what happens when people live far apart and things occur in their lives.

I just wish I could have told you one more time that I did miss you and loved you and thought you were the best b/f that your g/f could have.

Now all I have are memories.

BRADYs, be strong.  I know this must be extremely difficult.  She is in a better place now and hold onto those memories forever.

I love you and will miss you dearly Natalie ""beautiful b/f"" Evaro.

"event","Awhile ago, I wrote a post that WAS directed at someone but was about a certain situation.  Not about the person in general.

I will come out right now and say I always liked Joey, and Lia and anyone else out there can vouch for that.  I thought he was funny and sweet and great to hang out with.  When everything started happening with him and Lia, I was hurt because I didn't expect it and I hated seeing Lia like that, so I went to my livejournal to say how I felt about THAT SITUATION, not about Joey particularly as a person.

To this day, I still like Joey as a person.  If I saw him walking down the mall or anything, I would hate to think that because I sided with Lia (who is one of my best friends) on it, that he would hate me too.  I would love to give him a hug like I always did and just catch up.

So there it is.  I do not hate Joey at all...I never have.  I didn't agree with what happened and how Lia felt, that's all.  But I stated my opinion and was a man about it, everyone knew it was me who said it.  But whoever you are, anonymous commenter, you just keep coming back for no reason.  If you truly are one of Joey's really good friends and you're just trying to defend him, I understand, but I'm here.  I'm not violent and you obviously know who I am and who Lia is as well, so contact me.  But be real, tell me who you are.  But continuing to comment on RANDOM livejournals about MY personal life and putting ME down is taking it too far.  If you really hate me that much, go to your livejournal or don't be afraid to say who you are.  I am more than willing to talk.

I would just appreciate it if the anonymous comments came to a halt.  Because the truth is, you're not really commenting to anything I'm saying, you're commenting to make me feel bad and get a rise out of me.  But it's kind of ridiculous now.  Just tell me who you are or take to your own livejournal/blog to rant about me.  I promise I won't comment mean anonymous things to you if you do.  Or maybe if you said things with validity or whatever, I'd respond normally, but when you come on here and write nonsense comments that have nothing to do with any of my posts because of my ONE post against what happened, then it needs to quit or a name/face needs to be put to the anonymity (if that's a word haha).

Other than that, hello all.  I miss many of you and I am having a wonderful life.

I am more than proud to be from New York.  The love I have for that city cannot even be put into words.  The affect that 9/11 had on me will be with me forever.

There aren't many words I can say that can truly describe how I feel.  I just want to say I think of the families/lives that were affected by 9/11 every single day and I will never forget this day for as long as I live.

I love NY & all my family there.

Bless you all."

"event","Before I even continue on this post, the first thing I will say is I do not want any negative feedback at all.  Actually, any feedback would be fine as well.  I have just been racking my brain with this all week long and knew I had to write about it and of course, I will take to my lj.  If you feel like commenting and encouraging me, thanks, but as soon as any negativity starts, I will disable comments.  If you don't agree, that's fine, I am not asking anyone to agree, I am simply stating my opinion.  If you feel so strong that you need to counter act my post, do it in your own journal, but please don't start berrating mine with negativity or replying with responses like 'Well, what do you know about Biden?' or 'Pfft...you wouldn't know politics if it bit you in the ass.'  I am not claiming to know every detail and I am not claiming to be perfect, I am simply stating how I feel at the moment, thank you =)

And now.  I don't think I have ever felt this passionate about an election before.  I think it is possibly because I am a true adult now.  I pay for absolutely everything on my own and am in debt and have bills and things of that nature and I can definitely choose someone that I feel will help me in anyway, shape or form.  

It is very known that when Hilary was in the race, I was very much a big supporter.  I loved Bill Clinton for the man that he was, even though I was quite young and didn't understand politics.  I found him to be charismatic and approachable and doing a damn good job running this country.  So naturally I was heartbroken when his years ended and someone else had to take over.  I never wanted Bush in power and all these years, I have been dying for the day he would leave.  When Hilary entered the political race, I was ecstatic.  From her days as first lady, she always talked about universal healthcare and that has always been a major issue to me.  I have had many problems in my whole life with healthcare, as I know many friends and family that have as well and even making insurance cheaper so everyone can afford it would be such a feat for me.  I was dissapointed when Hilary failed but happy when I researched Obama and felt as if he could take on the role.

Do not get me wrong.  There are things about every single candidate I do not like and that's how it will always be.  I just agree with way more that Obama wants than McCain.

I watched the DNC as much as I could and have been researching a lot about this political race.  It is becoming very heated and I cannot wait for the debates and such.  Naturally, I was very much looking forward to who McCain would choose for his running mate.  I was shocked when he chose Sarah Palin, mainly because of her location.  She is from an extremely small state and I just pre-perceived that it was awkward.  I was very eager to hear from her and see what she had to say and what she had to stand up for.

I was obviously immediately dissapointed and infuriated.

As soon as she took her position as McCain's running mate, the skeletons didn't just come out of the closet, they flew out!  Teen daughter pregnancy, autistic son, secession from the union?  I was just shocked to hear so much about her in such a short amount of time.  Then I became proud because Obama/Biden immediately said they would not touch her personal life and would not attack her, etc etc.  I thought that was extremely noble and smart of them.  The second either of them say even one word wrong, the world is going to attack them for being 'sexist' so they have a very fine line to ride.

I was extremely eager to see her speech at the RNC and as soon as it became available online, I watched it.  I will admit, I watched her speech about 3 times.  Not because I thought it was so good, but because I hated her for so many words that came out of her mouth.  She immediately berrated her opponents, specifically Obama, as if it was all good.  I understand this is the nitty gritty of the race and it's coming down to the end but I mean, come on.  They stand and say they won't attack you and be negative and the first time you're able to speak publicly, the first thing you do is put him down.  Eh.  I also feel as if she's putting this whole ""I'm just like you"" spitz on high way too much.  ""I'm a hockey mom, I'm from a small town, I married my high school sweetheart..."" blah blah.  But the fact of the matter is, you aren't just like us.  You've made a lot of personal desicions in your life that a lot of Americans would look down upon and not approve of.  Also, you're going to run our country, so no, you're not like us.  I don't feel I can ever run the country, as I'm sure many Americans would agree with.  The truth is, it doesn't take the average hockey mom to run the country or the lady in the small town...it takes a lot more so you have to be more than just the regular public.  You have to be above and beyond what people want and need.

In her speech, Palin made many points that I found to be ridiculous and just downright false.  She stated McCain to be the man to run the country because he said ""I'd rather lose the election than see my country lose a war.""  I completely agree with the fact that I wouldn't want the USA to lose anything when it comes to war, but the truth is, at this point, this is a bullshit war.  If you go down the street in Times Square and stop 50 people and ask all of them if they know the EXACT reason as to why we are in the war at this very moment, I guarantee only about a quarter of them will know the exact reason and the others will be a misc answer of oil, terrorism, nuclear weapons and more.  She also stated that there will be more benefits for people with special needs, since her son is one of those children now.  But let's be real here...special needs humans are apart of a minority...just like many of us who are apart of other minorities.  Why do special needs people get special treatment and homosexuals don't?  You are born being gay, you don't choose that.  Trust me, I have many gay friends and I know people don't choose to be outcast from family and society.  So why do people that were born with a 'different need' any different from people born with 'different love'?  I am not saying people with special needs don't deserve that, trust me, they do deserve fundings and special charities and things of that nature, but aren't all men created equal?  If this minority is going to get great treatment, every minority should.  She even said the love that a special needs person requires is a special love.  Is she saying that a homosexual doesn't deserve that kind of love?

She made it a point to say that yay, small town, we love America.  Even though Democrats are extremely liberal and we oppose wars does not mean we aren't proud of America.  I love this country and all the things I am able to achieve here.  I am just not proud of the leaders and the decisions they make and that's completelty different.

She stated that because she was a small town mayor, she had actual responsibilities and that 'community leaders' didn't, trying to say Obama doesn't have experience.  Mind you, it has been said that Obama has had his name on many documents that helped stopped weapons of mass destruction and more.  She also said that media is calling her out for different things but I think it's actually kind of funny.  The media has been more focused on the things that don't matter about Palin and they have been doing shitty coverage, at least in my opinion.  I also think that it's funny that she's putting those media outlets down that have been giving her shit but it's okay to praise the ones that have been supporting you, which are a lot, trust me.  She said it doesn't matter to her what those reporters say, but, does she forget that those reporters are proud citizens of this country as well and it's their job to report what their station says.  Putting them down isn't going to help you win votes, or make you look any better or more mature.  

She also states how the Americans should have more money and Obama is going to raise taxes and that's going to take money away from them, blah blah blah...buuut McCain/Palin want to continue this war until we are 'victorious' and this war is costing the US billions of dollars?  So who's the one wasting our money?  She stated that Obama never uses the word victory when it comes to the war, only when it comes to campaign.  I think Obama is seeing how American families are hurt by this war and only wants the best for the Americans and their families...which is to bring back their kids as soon as possible.  Palin and many, many Republicans also keep putting down Obama for his 'greek columns' that he stood in front of on the night of his speech but I am pretty sure that as many people know, the White House was modeled after many Greek statues and buildings.  And, to my knowledge and everyone I've asked, when I asked what they thought his stage looked like, we all agreed it looked like the White House and Oval Office.  Also, who cares what he was standing in front of?!?!  I mean, to be honest, he could have been standing in front of men fellating men and I would have given 2 fucks because the truth is, isn't what's important the things that come out of his mouth?  The words he has to say to us, the views he wants to share with us, his plan for our country...not something he is standing in front of.  If what he is standing in front of is the best you Republicans can do with putting Obama down, keep it coming, cause that means Obama is kicking some ass.

She stated Obama is trying to forfeit this war when victory is in sight.  Is it really in sight?  Or when you guys get elected do you plan to ask for more things and keep the troops in there for ridiculous reasons?  Obama doesn't want us to give up, he simply wants things settled as soon as possible and us to be out of there and not dwell and lollygag.

She also said Obama uses 'change' to promote his career...while McCain uses his career to promote change.  The truth is, McCain has agreed with 90% of what Bush has done while he has been in term and they are both liberal Republicans, so there won't be a change.  Obama wants something completely different.  We need Democrats changing things...not the same ol Republican way.  One of the last things she said was that the truth is that there is only one man in this campaign that is fighting for us and that is McCain..because he was a POW and a war vet.  Thanks for putting me down Palin.  Just cause I am not apart of the military like your son there doesn't mean I can't fight for what my country believes in?  And trust me, just because you've been a POW does NOT mean you can automatically run a country better than anyone else!!!

Jon Stewart does incredible coverage of everything from both points...pointing out things the media should always point out, which is when we are being lied to as Americans and when these political jerks try to mess us around and make us look like idiots like we don't pay attention to details.  So, the other day when Palin was announced as VP, Stewart had a lovely little video where different Republicans pretty much shoved their foot so far in their mouth, they'll be tasting leather till November 4th.  Here we go:
-Karl Rove was promoting Palin and saying she was a great candidate and she's run this great city and dealt with a lot.  Palin's city has 9,000 people (2x the size of Flanagan, not much)
Yet last month when Tim Cain was up for possible Obama VP, Rove put him down saying that he wasn't experienced enough because he was mayor of Richmond, which only had 200,000 citizens and that's not much and he may not be capable of leading many.  Is that so Rove?  I forgot that 9,000 was clearly a way bigger population than 200,000?
-Bill O'Reilly is known as a huge conservative news show anchor.  When it was announced that Palin's 17 year old daughter was 5 months pregnant, he said that this is a personal matter of the family and that they are responsible and as long as we taxpayers don't have to pay for it, we should give them their respect and privacy.  Now let's flashback to when Jamie Lynn Spears got pregnant.  He put her down, said her parents were obviously to blame and said they were pinheads.  Mind you, Jamie Lynn and the Spears family are LOADED because of both their daughters' success, so their child will definitely not be on the taxpayers, yet, they are still to blame and it's bad parenting?  Hmmm.
-Dick Morris stated earlier this week that we had a deep sexism problem in this country and we should lighten up on Palin.  Yet in 11/07, Morris said that Hilary couldn't complain cause she was going to be running with the big dogs and she needed to suck it up.  And her problem was whenever she gets under fire, she retreats behind the apron strings.  Now, Dick Morris, who is being sexist to Palin?  How dare they!!!
-Nancy Pfotenhauer, McCain's SR policy advisor, said that Hilary couldn't play the victim card in her campaign and that we don't want that in a president.  Yet, the other day (surprise surprise) said that people can't belittle Palin because she's a woman and that it would be an outrageous double standard.  Double standard??  Of course you know that definition Pfotenhauer.
-Last but not least, we should take into account what our great VP candidate Palin said in 3/08...Hilary can't whine about the criticism and roughness that she's taking, she needs to work harder and prove herself and stop letting the gender card be thrown in.  Is that so Palin?  If that is so, Democrats, please rip her a new one.

This is a woman who has an autistic child for controversial reasons (it has been said that she withheld her labor so the baby could be born in Alaska and that's what caused his autism).  She has a pregnant daughter at 17, before she was married, yet wants OUR children to practice abstinence until marriage!!  She wants history books to completely wipe out the big bang and things of that nature and only go by what the Bible says.  Our country is built upon the fact that we are diverse and all men are created equal.  So now, she wants us all to suddenly believe what their beliefs are, bullshit!  This is a woman who was once apart of a group with her husband that wanted to secede from the union...which means LEAVE THE UNITED STATES!!  She wants to now run our country when she previously completely wanted to say 'Fuck you US, Alaska rocks and we want out!'  This is a woman who wants to push all these beliefs on our Americans, but when her and her husband got married, magically 8 months later, she had a kid, NOT premature!  So yes, she had premarital sex.

I will once again state, I am not saying Obama/Biden are perfect. Everyone is imperfect.  I am just stating that the Republicans are running a very false campaign and if you want the truth, sadly, read PerezHilton, read ONTD, watch the Daily Show with Jon Stewart because they are reporting the REAL stuff, what we aren't being told.

There you have it.  It's long and I don't care who reads it or not, I just needed to write it.  I will say that yes, I do not know every detail and yes, my candidates might not be perfect either, but this is from the facts I've seen and witnessed and just needed to say it.  Once again, please no negativity.  If so, take to your own lj or blog or bulletin and say what you want.

"event","Hey guys.  I haven't posted in a long time, I know, hopefully I can sometime this weekend while we have downtime but I am SUPER excited cause Cory & I are going up to Orlando this weekend to go to Disney with Lia, Estee & LiaBrother and to see my amazing friends.  I am super stoked.  Disney always makes me UBER happy and I am excited to stay with friends and such and see what happens!!

Today was super busy for me and super stressful.  I had to figure out my stupid school shit.  I swear, I hate BCC with everything inside of me.  They are such cocksuckers.  Regardless, it ended up working out cause I got a grant for like 800$ so it covered my books which was SCHWEEEEEET since I got douched over on ebay.  But I am not stressed now and super excited to go.  We're gonna be traveling a little late...we're probably not gonna get out on the road until about 8:00 pm but that's fine.  We're staying with Marc tonight, then going to Disney manana and then staying at a hotel there and then hanging around Oviedo on Sunday with some friends and stuff and staying at Desi's sunday night and then coming home Monday afternoon-ish.  This is gonna be a well needed trip.

Anyways, other than this weekend, life is pretty good.  It's the fall so that means Michael is back and I work everyday which is awesome.  I am making my money back and am constantly busy.  I am taking Sociology and Psych this semester to get ready for Nova Nursing.  I am taking all the pre-reqs they need and applying as soon as possible so I am excited to go there cause I fucking hate BCC and I'd rather spend damn good money and get fucking great experience at Nova than learn from shitty assholes at BCC.  I am still with Cory and he makes me so damn happy.  We have ups and downs, but nowhere near as much as I've seen with other couples and we're both extremely satisfied.  I started going to NSU Gym and I love working out and feeling better about myself.  My family is a fucking madhouse and will soon be outta there because I am moving in with LiaMom!!!  I am so stoked, it's gonna be great!!  Other than that, same ol.  Love my boy, my job, my friends and most of my life.

Have a great labor day weekend guys, i'll catch ya on the flipside.

So get over it and deal with the fact that you messed up and maybe you shouldn't have done such a dick thing.

I don't feel bad for you and honestly, I don't think a lot of you should.

"event","People go through their lives with many 'life experiences' under their belt.  They can tell stories, relate to others feelings and just grow in so many ways from these supposed experiences.  The only problem is...is sharing these experiences living in the past or simply sharing for the future?  Even if it's both, shouldn't we live for today?

I got to thinking that it's extremely hard to plan ones life out.  It is so unpredictable and up in the air.  So many people rely on what they know of the past for planning out their day/future..but does it really help?  I mean, the past IS the past.  It's always been said that 'history repeats itself' but does it really?  I've been through 21 years of a lot of bullshit and so far, it's all brand new to me.

I am a firm believer in living for today.  In past times, I have let myself become obsessed with the past and/or the future.  I wasn't happy because 'so many bad things' had happened to me and 'I wanted someone to be with me' in the future.  Yet, I wasn't thinking for that moment.  Cause in that moment, I could have been happy, I could have moved on, but I didn't.  I chose to live for the past and/or the future.

I know when put through certain events, it's hard to move on.  I know that because of my father's death, friends dicking me over, falling in love with someone who didn't want to fall in love with me.  But how long do I dwell on those things before I start bettering myself?  For example, when I was in love with Kendall, he was everything.  I screwed with others and actually had relationships and such, but through it all, I stayed true to my feelings for him, because all I could remember was that flashback to when he pleased me so much and that was worth all the bullshit he put me through.  In the end, I grew up.  Love ends.  It is sad and a terrible thing but it does.  There is only so long that someone can stay attached to the other SOLELY.  Unless there is reciprocation, there has to be that point that one can fully look into themselves and say they need to move on, to better their PRESENT and make their lives fun and exciting again.  I stayed stuck on Kendall for almost 3 years.  In actuality, our little fling really only lasted about 3 real months...with us playing a few random innings here and there.  But the truth is, I finally saw it one day and I realized that it was all child's play...and I was extremely dissapointed in myself for letting it get that far.  3 years?!?!  That's insane.  I mean, it led me directly to Cory and I couldn't be happier but wasting 3 years on a guy is hardly what I thought I would ever be saying.  Look, I can sit here and type fucking 10 pages on every detail of what I did wrong, etc but that won't help.  I tried it before and it changed absolutely nothing.  I stopped living in what I thought was 'our' past and lived for my present and I ended up the happiest I have ever been in my 21 years of living.  Kendall is now a mere flashback that flashes by and reminds me of what an amazing gift I have NOW, in the present.  I cannot begin how amazing it feels to be able to comfortably talk about him and not feel sad or regret or anything.  He is a man in my past but it's gone and I am happy he is gone.

This is not an attack on anyone/anything.  I know the human's emotions are all different and yes, it takes us all extremely different amounts of times to get over events/boys/deaths, etc.  But how many days can we revel in the past?  You going over every detail/every word/every car turn/every thing done is NOT gonna bring a person back, is not gonna make the event reverse itself, will not bring back love.  It's up to you as a person to continue on, to better yourself, to better your present.

I am a perfect example.  My father died when I was 10, I lived in an extremely disfunctional house, I was suicidal, I fell in love to have my heart ripped out and I am here, the happiest I have ever been.  Because I chose a day that my past would be the past, the future would be waiting for me when I got there and the present was here and now.  Most importantly, the flashbacks will help me move on.  Whenever I get stressed, it's nice to not dwell, but flashback.  Think of a moment, think of anything that I was worse off and to know the present couldn't be better.

There are good and bad sides to everything but overanalyzing and swelling will only lead to more heartache and more questioning yourself as a human being.  You are beautiful and always will be, but others won't see that today unless you see that today.  So to those of you who have been able to put your past away in that old box and wait for the future like I have, I applaud you immensely.  And to those of you who are having trouble coping, go look in the mirror.  Cause at this moment, right now, you are you and everything that has happened has molded you into the amazing person you are.  Throw the past away and realize there's nothing like living for the day because hey, tomorrow it will just be the past.

Remember, as much as you analyze everything, you can't CHANGE anything.  The past will remain the past.  It's up to you to store them as flashbacks and live for the moment, live for today, for today is beautiful."

"event","Lately, I have been trying to come to terms with the science of a human.  My emotions are nuts lately and not necesarrily in a bad way.  I have just been very empowered by certain emotions and it makes me wonder what triggers that, is it all really science?  Have you ever seen a DJ board in a radio station?  There are TONS of switches for incoming calls, to play music, cut to and from commercial, volume, equalizers, the whole nine.  Is it possible that the human body is just a switchboard of emotions?  You have the control as to whether or not you want a certain switch on high or low?  It can't all be science, can it?

Driving in SoFla has lately gotten me into some tempers.  I say things to complete strangers sometimes that when I think back on later I am shocked.  True, some people deserve it, but really, does someone deserve to crash into a revene for cutting me off?  I was at a store the other day and this older gentleman was on my ass in the cash-out line.  Literally.  His cart could not be any closer to my ass if I tried.  My ass then moved forward, as did his cart, again, right on me.  It was irritating but I've never been one to publicly make a fool of myself.  I am now paying with my debit card, so I'm standing in front of the debit machine thing and this asshole puts his cart behind me so when I go to get out, I will bump into it.  I am pissed but as I leave, shrug it off as another SoFla jerk.  Now I am in a right turn lane to turn onto Flamingo and traffic is nuts, so I am waiting till it clears to pull out.  I mean, I have a Ford Ranger, and yes it is powerful but a BMW it is not.  It can't pull out and be at 60 mph in 4 secs, so I am waiting patiently but not like a grandma.  Then, what do you know, the ass behind me in the check-out line cuts me off in the turn lane and swerves into traffic.  At that point, I flipped the switch.  My anger switch that is.  Who the hell was this guy to be on my ass?  What was so urgent for him to bother me in line and now cut me off and endanger the lives of other drivers?  At that point, I had my switch at full blast I believe because then I threw myself into Flamingo traffic and started swerving in and out of lanes to catch up to this guy to give him some 2 sense, which from me would be loud, obnoxious honking and the middle finger repeatedly, possibly screaming Cunt through my window.  I got up to about 80 mph on a 45 mph road and hit a red light, where jerk wasn't.  The light made me move my switch down significantly.

I have friends who have preached to me about certain things in their life over and over again.  Yet, when taken in the moment, when the switches are turned, they let that situation take over.  Is it really science or do we have control of our own switches?  If I say I hate this person, I am over them, I never want to see them again, etc etc and then when in the presence, I let him take over and make a big mistake, is that science or are we letting our switches get to the maximum level to quickly?

I firmly believe we have a control over our switches, but why do we let them get carried away so quickly?  Do we like making ourselves look dumb?  Is it good to humiliate ourselves sometimes?  What is it within us as humans to let the switches run wild?  It isn't always bad switches either.  Ever since I got my new job/new truck, my family seems to think I am the patron saint of good.  I am far from that.  Yes, I am making more money and I have a good, reliable car, more reliable than anyone's in my family, but that doesn't mean I'm all of a sudden gonna be a saint?  But for some reason my ""advantage"" switch is on high lately and I let my family walk all over me.  Why am I so afraid to say no?  Or say I'm an adult and I don't need this bullshit.  I guess it's my compassion switch for my mother, that's always at high levels.

When people piss you off, you have every right to be mad.  When love is in the picture, you have every right to be vulnerable.  When your family is involved, you have every right to be compassionate.  Life throws different situations in your life every single second of the day.  You have to learn how to cope with so many emotions and situations, but when you sit down and get to thinking, where does science end and one's hands start controlling your own switches?"

I signed up for my fall 2008 class.  Anatomy & Phys II with the lab and it's Monday & Wednesdays, 8-1 pm.  Then I take care of Michael in the afternoons.  I am very excited.  I need to get A's in A&P I & II.  Not necesarrily, I just need a 3.0 GPA and I got an A in Chem and a B in ENC1101.  I have a great GPA at the moment, I just am expecting a lot out of myself.  I want an A to be on the top of the list.  Then, come January, I turn in my grades and the packet and such for the Nursing program for Fall 2009.  Yay.  In between that, I only need to take Microbiology and I believe a lab so nothing serious.  I am quite excited.

Cory & I are going to take a trip to Montreal next year to see Formula 1 racing.  We are so excited.  It's gonna be expensive but hey, we only live once, why not go all out?

I am very excited for a few things in the future.  Ashley's 21st at the beachhh, Kristin's 21st, July DCI trip, New York in August, and just mucho mucho happiness.

The future is quite promising.

"event","Here I am, 11:03 p.m. on a Thursday night laying in Cory's bed.  Seems like a typical night to me, but the wheels in my head just keep on turning.  I really wanna reference Tina Turner right now, but I will refrain.  I feel so blessed lately with everything that has been going on.  I have the greatest friends a gal could ask for.  The type of friends that you feel you can share the world with, the type you can see at your wedding, whenever it is that our crazy asses choose to walk down that aisle, so to speak.  I have never had people care about me as much as they all do and for that, I am truly grateful.  When it comes to jobs, there are so few people I know who can say they love their job.  I mean, really, who likes getting up and going to do something that isn't particularly your passion yet.  I, however, have found that nice 'medium' job.  One may ask what a 'medium' job is, and here we go.  A 'medium' job is that job where your life is in limbo.  You are going to school or trying to figure out what the hell you want to do for the rest of your life and you need a fairly decent job to pay all your bills and shoes and the silly stuff you like to buy constantly, in my recent case, it's used DVD's from MovieStop.  Finding a good 'medium' job is quite difficult, mainly in the point that it's not your final career, so the passion for a job like this are slim to none.  I have worked many 'medium' jobs, hoping to one day find that semi-permanent 'medium' and much to my surprise, it took me many years.  Because for the darndest reason, at the beginning of every 'medium' job, I've been so excited at the prospect of new people and new experiences that I was blinded.  Blinded by the man, I like to say.  Yes, the man, the retail man so to speak.  Retail jobs are where most teenagers/early 20s girls start off their 'medium' and a lot stick to it, and others, like myself, have hopped like Roger Rabbit from job to job hoping for the glowing light at the end of the tunnel.  I found mine a few months ago.  I am a personal assistant/nanny for a good friend of mine since I was about 11.  The kid will possibly give me early grey hairs and I will definitely not stay there forever, but for the time being, they have filled my 'medium' and I can say I am happy with my 'medium' until I find my career.

Careers are such a scary thing to think of at my age, or so I think.  I mean, I am 21.  Do I really need to settle down to one job for the rest of my life?  I guess jobs are like love partners, you gotta love them for their wrongs and rights.  I am in school to be a future nurse.  At the moment, I would love to be an OR nurse but hey, I don't know shit yet so who am I kidding?  I am quite excited to start it all but the awful establishment of BCC has made it so difficult for me to enjoy the process.  There's nothing like walking into an office there and seeing the icky drab color of the older women's hair and the face of dissatisfaction that this is the best they will do with their lives.  Instead of knowing that and simply accepting it, they like to take it out on us students, who they wish they were in our shoes once more, to have the possibility of becoming something else.  It's quite depressing once thought about, then they go and say the next douchebag thing to me and my sadness for them quickly turns into loathing and wishing harmful things upon their day.  Hey, what can I say, I get pissed quite easily.  Regardless of that fact, I am at BCC for years to come and I must admit, I am stable and happy.  I mean, who really made up that fact that kids had to do 4 straight years of college and get their degree ASAP?  Honestly, most of the 4 year college grads I have met or am an acquaintance of, are serving drinks behind a bar because they can't do shit with their degree, or somewhere down the line, found out that business or law wasn't their passion, but had school paid up and couldn't necesarrily drop it.  I understand, Mommy or Daddy paid, scholarships, grants, loans..it makes perfect sense.  The only sad part is, when did people start becoming such wimps to stick up for their passions?  I, for one, didn't go to school for almost 2 years and I can say I am much happier now than I thought I could ever be.  True, while my friends are graduated with a degree, I will still be seeking mine, but will they be as happy as me in the end?  Only time will tell.  I decided last year I will be a successful nurse, no matter how long that takes.  Hey, maybe all my bartender friends with law or business degrees with get into a bar brawl and I'll get to take care of them one day.  Oh, a chick can only dream.  I know for sure who wouldn't want to be in my care, those damn BCC office workers.  Anyways...

Many people have different versions of what they would describe happiness as.  The average girl in her twenties would say her happiness is getting laid, going out drinking and having a good time.  This average girl in her twenties says there is nothing better than friends, music and love.  I feel I grew up to quickly but sometimes I can't help but wonder if maybe that was perfect for me.  I always have on going battles with best friends, not bad ones, just ones where our opinions clash and I find great comfort in telling you it does not bother either one of us when we don't agree, and that's amazing.  Finding a person you can disagree with and it not bother you or run to talk shit about it the next day, superb.  I lost my virginity at 16 and a lot of women say they hate the term 'lost it' but the truth is, I did.  David Knapp was his name and my then best friend's little brothers room was the place.  It was so terrible and he was one of those preverbial 'white thinks he black' boys.  The affair lasted awhile but then he was gone, just like that, taking his new girlfriend and my virginity with him in his gold Cavalier.  I guess that's what you get wanting to 'be with an older man' who really was less mature than my 16 year old self.  I grew up with no father and that didn't help on the male front.  I have, since 10, become extremely attached to any male figure who get's close to me.  Some have latched back on, becoming some of the best friends a girl could ask for, some latched on but not to my heart, but the lower regions down there and once they had what they wanted, they left.  I took them all with a grain of salt for I was young and didn't really care then.  As this little girl got older, I became more obsessed with love and relationships and I was so desperate for it, I could have easily put myself on the home shopping network and auctioned off dates with myself.  I finally found what I thought of as a man, little did I know then, I was still dealing with a boy.  His name was Kendall and boy, did I think he was my world.  For 2 whole years I thought he was my world.  He gave me the impression every now and then that he was, until he fucked a few other girls and I was just the bermuda triangle in his world.  I disappeared and re-appeared every now and then and finally, I dissapeared on the final trip and have been the happiest girl ever since.  For at the time, what I thought was love, was lust and simply the idea of him wanting me as much as he did was the best thing I ever heard.  Now, when I think about Kendall, it was completely animalistic and nothing more than a good few bed romps and a lot of wasted tears and stupid emotions from an immature girl...and vastly immature boy.  I guess it's true when they 'what goes around comes around' though, because now Kendall is in a relationship I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy, enjoy!!

From Kendall, I did what every 20 year old girl would do.  I went out every weekend, got plastered, and slept with men here and there.  I had repeat offenders and I had some rookies, but it was all the same to me, senseless sex.  I also became an out of control pothead.  I was one of those girls I now make fun of.  The kind of person that has to smoke before every social gathering, an addict so to speak.  The person who if they don't smoke probably won't enjoy their night.  I was her and at the time, I thought I was living the life.  That is until my party partner Ashley left me for a week in June of 07 on a cruise.  For the past 6 months, her and I were non-stop, how was I gonna survive a week without her?  I did what I would do at that time, lurk myspace.  I lurked enough to find a man named Cory Deal, my current boyfriend.  We had a class in high school together and let me tell you, from the moment I saw him, I didn't need parties or pot or parental guidance, I found everything I wanted.  I gave it all up that week and have not looked back since.  I can say, I am truly happy with that decision.  That's where my 'old age' comes in.  Don't get me wrong, I am definitely not an old woman if that's what you're thinking.  I just have a different perspective.  I have recently become obsessed with watching Sex & The City from the first season until I reach the last.  I watched the series when it was originally on, my mom and I would watch it every week, btw, SATC started when I was about 14, that might make sense about the early sex age and throwing boys away at a certain point in my life.  One of the episodes made me laugh at the fact that they are all in their 30s but I completely agreed with so many things they had to say.  It was an episode where they try to suggest that girls in their 20s were the new women in their 30s and were taking their spotlight.  Yet, a weekend away at the Hamptons and at a college bonfire tells them differently.  Because never would a respectable woman in her 30s be seen smoking weed quite publicly, dressing like whores and getting so drunk they don't remember things from the night before or puke in public.  Puking in public, big no no.  Embarassing and quite frankly, very not classy.  I am not saying I am Princess Di over here, I have my faults.  Many, at which right now, we will not go into detail.  But I am pleased to know I can go out there, have a drink or two and be completely content.  I told my best friend Ashley the other day that I think it's funny when she gets shitfaced, or other people do, because have you ever seen the look on people's faces when taking shots?  I mean, really, it doesn't look pleasant at all.  I call it the anal face.  It's the face that looks like someone is getting anally penetrated and it's quite uncomfortable, but it would be rude to say it is, so they take it all like it's no big deal.  That's what people do with shots.  Unless it is mixed to taste like something good, straight liquor shots are not enjoyable, and those of you who will go against me and say yes, check out your anal face next time you down a Patron shot.  I just find such humor in people who are willing to spend hundreds of dollars a weekend on alcoholic drinks that make them smell shitty, look shitty and possibly throw up something shitty the next morning.  And this society complains about gas prices these days, pfft.  Spend more on gas, less on trash, trust me, it will be worth it.

I truly want to write on the side.  I feel like I have a lot to say and this little mind can't deal with all these thoughts.  I might start taking workshops or something, anything to get my work out there and possibly get something going.  I would love to be a blogger and just get some money from it.  I could be perfectly comfortable coming home every night to my laptop and writing anything I feel.  Just the thought of it makes me feel so liberated.

My life has been a big amusement park.  Some rides are kiddy and can be sad, some are long and informative, some are wet and fun and others are the kind that as soon as you reach that exit sign, you're yearning to jump back in that line all day.  My current ride is the last one, where I can ride it for the rest of my life if given the chance."

I got an A on my 2nd Chem test and I could not be happier.  I have 2 more tests, one on Monday and then one 2 weeks from now and then we have presentations...but the teacher is so nice, she pretty much has said if we make the presentation at least 5 minutes then we get an A.  I need to achieve 2 more A's and I got an A in Chem!!!  So I am gonna study study study this weekend and hopefully make that dream come true.

Cory leaves me tomorrow morning at 5 AM for 10 days.  I am sooo sad.  I don't know how I am gonna handle being without him.  I mean, I know I am gonna hang with my friends a lot and such, but we haven't been apart for more than like 2 days...haha.  I am gonna miss him so damn much.  I love him so much.  But when he gets back, ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY!!!  Yay yay yay!!

I think I should add that I am extremely happy right now, besides him leaving.  I love my true friends, I love my job, I love my boy more than anything.

"event","Sorry about the cut off yesterday, it was like 12:30 am and my bosses got home from their Vegas trip sooo I had to dip cause I wanted to go home and sleep with my love.  Yesterday was great though.  We went to University Bowl, now known as Sparez.  I of course blew.  We totally needed bumpers and I haven't been there in YEARS so I didn't realize you had to tell them beforehand now, I thought they were still able to be pulled out by yourself.  Oh well, I had fun though.  Then went and took care of Michael until the rents showed up.  Good weekend indeed.

I am watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  I went to MovieStop and got all of them not that long ago and have been watching them non-stop.  It is insane how much I love everything about this series.  But I have been getting upset lately.  I hate reading articles/blog posts about 'how the rest of the movies are gonna suck' and 'OMG they don't have every single detail in the movie' and 'oh no, they cut that character?!  i am never watching the 6th movie'.  REALLLY!??!!  I guarantee all their asses will be at the midnight premiere like the rest of us lovers.  You gotta know the difference.  Every MOVIE made from a BOOK is an ADAPTATION, which means, yes, things will be cut and moved around.  If you love the books so much, keep reading them.  Yes, I would LOVE for them to include EVERY detail but honestly, Harry Potter is aimed for children.  The movies are already long enough for kids to sit through, most of them running at 2 and a half hours.  So could you imagine if they had every detail?  They'd be hours long.  Yes, I would LOVE to sit and watch hours and hours of Harry Potter but let's be real, the studio doesn't have the money or time to do that.  And the movies are still sick as fuck.  I've loved all of them and will love the rest of them solely based on the fact that it's Harry Potter, one of the greatest stories out there.  I can always go back to this and be happy for as long as I live.  This series will forever be a legacy in the world and appreciate it for what it is...sheer brilliance.

Sorry bout the rant, people just piss me off.  I love Harry Potter and always will.  I cannot wait for November 21 (the alleged release of the 6th movie)or whenever they will release it.  I also cannot wait for Harry Potter island at Islands of Adventure, I WILL be there opening weekend, with all the rest of the crazies.  =)  I will be fully decked out and enjoying it all.  OHMYGOD, I WONDER IF THEY'RE GONNA GET A KID WHO LOOKS LIKE HARRY.  I WILL DIE!!!  Haha.  Gosh, I love this all.  Scheduled date for that is beginning of 2010, January definitely.  So yay!!  Last time I went to IOA, which was a month ago, they already had the metal structure for Hogwarts castle so woowee!!!

Cory leaves this Friday morning on a family vacation for 10 days.  I do not know what I am gonna do.  We've done 10 days apart before but we did it like 3 weeks into our relationship so it wasn't that bad.  I am just so nervous that I am gonna miss him so much.  I know I have all my friends and stuff, it's not like I'm gonna be doing NOTHING but I will just miss him like crazy and I might be veryyyy sad at night when we normally see eachother even for a little bit.  The only good thing about him being gone is as soon as he gets back it's our anniversary for 1 year =).  Yay yay yay.  I've gotten him the coolest things and I know he's gonna loooooove them.

Now it's time for me to enjoy some Harry Potter.  Love ya guys.

I had such a great weekend.  We just relaxed on Friday and caught up on relaxing.  On Saturday we went to Naples again.  It is so beautiful there.  I really wanna get a house there when I'm older.  Not to permanently live there obviously but to have like a beach house.  Yup, I am gonna be that successful, you don't even know.  =)  So yeah, we got a cooler and drinkies and made some sandwiches and had snacks.  It was wonderful.  Except we sat out for way too long, about 5 hours to be exact.  My knees and random parts of my arm are burning.  But it was totally worth it to be with my babe on a beautiful beach day.  Then today I had to work so we took Michael to Dolphin Mall, where I finally got some AMAZINGLY cute dresses from Forever 21 that I have been wanting for awhile.  We went to a buncha different stores and then went bowling, I totally sucked.

It's sooo perfect.  I love him so much.  It's so cheesy but it's insane, everytime I see him, I still get butterflies and when he kisses me, it's like a dream.  I can't imagine I have something so amazing.  He is worth everything.  I love him.

Nova gym here I come!!!  I wanna lose a shit ton of weight this summer, I wanna look like I did in high school which was nice and healthy.  I am so excited.  I will start going with my baby some nights and I will be going after school everyday.  So stoked.  Weight loss here I come!!!

Legally Blonde is such a great movie haha.  I wanna see the musical so damn badly.  Someone gimmie mula to go see it when I visit NY later this summer haha.

Here's the song, night lovers. <3

""Stay Beautiful""

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as he's walking home
Saying, does he know
Will you ever know

[Chorus:]

You're beautiful
Every little piece love, don't you know
You're really gonna be someone, ask anyone
When you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it don't, stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, hey by the way

[Repeat Chorus]

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know

[Repeat Chorus]"

"event","Hey guys.  Besides my last rant, it has been a looooong time since I've posted an LJ.  It's hard being so busy and all but here is good news..I just got my own laptop and I love it & am addicted to it sooooo I will probably update a lot more.  I just never updated before cause the actual time I had on a computer, I would obv have to do other things such as facebook and pay bills and such soooo here we go again =)

Life is pretty damn good.  I am taking my pre-reqs for nursing school at BCC...I will be in the program fall of 2009...I know, it's a long ass time from now but that's what happens when you spend time off and when you have a sucky ass community college to go too.  I could have done it by January 2009 BUUUUUUT I would have had to spend all day at school all summer pretty much which would have meant no time for a job and knowing me and my life, I need a job.  I don't get supported anymore and it's all on me so yea.  So I'm taking it slowly and it doesn't discourage me in anyway, shape or form.  I know what I want and even if it took me 10 years, I'm gonna get it.  I'm completely content.  Plus, I am not genius when it comes to sciences so I should take my time and focus as much as possible anyways so I am happy.  I got an A on my first Chemistry test which I never thought possible considering I failed Chem at Flanagan so yay for me!!  I have my next test on Thursday and I loved these past few chapters so I'm crossing my fingers for another A...I know I can do it if I study my butt off.

I have a new job which is incredible.  I am a personal assistant/nanny for Michael, the kid I've known since he was born, Monica Moreno's little brother.  I love it so much.  They pay me incredible and it works amazingly with my school schedule and I have a lot of free time honestly so it's fantastic.  Plus, they're so well off, they really know how to take care of their employees.  I couldn't be happier.  It's pretty awesome to say I'm ""at work"" when I'm taking care of Michael and relaxing and going out to eat at tons of diff places and taking Michael on little adventures.  It's great.  I'm gonna try and go back to Summit Questa, even if it is only for like two days a week.  Any extra money is fantabulous.  And I miss the kids so much, especially my little Tyler.  But job wise I am super happy.

I love my friends more than life.  It is awesome to be 3 years out of high school and still be best friends with the people I love the most.  We did an alumni recital piece and it was absolutely fantastic.  I couldn't have asked for a better group to do it with and we pulled it off way easier and quicker than any of us thought.  Tara is still in Hawaii but moves back to the mainland in August, so she will be here mid-Aug to visit for 2 weeks and I couldn't be happier.  I have missed her more than anyone can imagine.  I am so excited for her to meet Cory and us to just have biffle time which is much needed.  I love her so much.  I am happy to say I still have the most amazing friends in the world.  And I love that we are all older and more mature because it can be weeks that we don't talk but as soon as we see eachother, it's as if no time has passed.  I love that.  I can't wait to be married or them be married and all of us be at eachother's weddings, taking pictures of the colorguard crew doing the face haha.  Seriously, at all of our weddings, there better be a picture of us doing the face!!!  Haha.  I love them all so much.

I love my Cory more than life.  He has been the greatest thing that has happened to me in I don't even know how long.  We drove to Naples yesterday just a random trip but it was beautiful and it made me so happy to have someone like him in my life.  He tries to deny it but he is so romantic and sweet and so spontaneous.  He's such an amazing guy.  And yes, he asked me to move in with him so probably by Sep/Oct we will have our own place in Sunrise/Plantation/Davie area, which makes me so happy.  I am an adult and I have a great guy and life is grand.

I really wanna see Indiana Jones like ASAP so someone come see it with me!!!  I want some Shia, mmmm.  Just watched Into The Wild and god Emile Hirsch is beautiful AND a great actor.  The movie was awesome.  I wanna see There Will Be Blood, Paul Dano is in it and I love him and the movie looks great.  Plus, Daniel-Day Lewis was fantastic in Gangs of New York sooo he should be great in this as well.  I am such a movie buff it's not even funny.  BTW, if you love buying DVDs, go to MovieStop!!!  It's the brother store of GameStop and yea, you guessed it, they have brand new & used DVDs and you can trade in and everything.  Their used DVDs are wicked cheap...I got 4 of the Harry Potter's for 16$.  I know what you're thinking, used DVDs suck cause they can be screwed up.  Buuuut MovieStop has a lifetime guarantee and if you keep the sticker on the DVD box, they will replace your DVD if ANYTHING happens to it, even if you did it yourself.  I know, they're amazing.

I am rambling but I have so much on my mind.  I had a great weekend.  Friday Cory and I made dinner and caught up on some shows (I'M STILL DYING TO SEE THE LOST FINALE) and then Saturday was Michael's 9th bday party sooo we went to that amazing fiesta and then spent the night with Kaitlin watching movies and eating yum yums.  Then we went to Naples yesterday and had a pizza/movie night.  Today we are cleaning his room and bathroom and then going to his parents for his PopPop's bday and some yummy Memorial Day BBQ.  I love life.

I love you all.

So let's say that I am extremely happy right now.  For once, truly, I can say I am so happy with so much.  I am back in school for the long haul.  I am going toward the nursing program and am extremely excited to jump into it all.  I got approved for the federal loan and could not be happier.  I work at Summit-Questa Montessori School and I love it so much.  I do after-care with the pre-schoolers and sub for classes.  The pay is great and it's such a laid back environment and it's literally 3 minutes from BCC so it's nice to run back and forth in the same area and not travel all of SoFla for everything.  My car is shitty as hell but now with having a pretty set schedule, hopefully something comes through and within the next few months, I will be gettinga Ford Focus and am SUPER excited.  It'll be nice to have a lot more responsibility.  I am just quite enticed for the future.

Cory and I are celebrating 8 months in the next 2 weeks and I could not be happier.  I truly never thought this would ever happen to me, I used to be the mopey sap that loved love and every guy treated her like shit, especially Kendall.  And I found my Prince Charming.  He seriously is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me.  He has made me see so much that I never thought I could.  I have never been happier.  We are both getting really excited for Valentine's which is SUPER AMAZING because if anyone of you remember, I have ALWAYS hated Valentine's, mainly cause I was alone.  Always wore black and protested it.  Haha.  Fuck, last year I spent Valentine's babysitting.  Sad, I know.  Haha.  But I am so excited.  I am getting him such great things and he keeps talking about the things he has ordered for me and how excited he is to give them to me and it's fantastic.  It seriously is so spectacular waking up next to him everyday.  Yes, everyday.  Haha, and on that note.

Remember the accident we got into in December?  Yea, he STILL doesn't have his car.  Which sucks.  Seriously, pay attention to this next line.  IF YOU HAVE PROGRESSIVE OR ARE THINKING ABOUT GETTING IT, BACK OUT NOW!!!  They have been giving Cory the run around.  They want to put old used parts on a BRAND NEW 08 MAZDASPEED that has 300 miles on it for Christ's sake.  The body shop said they would have had his car done in a month, probably less, and because of the insurance saying they won't pay or having to approve or arguing, it has taken this long.  They are saying it might take till March.  Wow!  So yes, I pretty much live with him.  I have to take him to and from work everyday and then run errands and such.  I do not mind doing it at all because when my car was still in the shits, Cory did everything for me.  It's just very non-stop for me, which is why I honestly don't do much else, so honestly, if you've been trying to hang or get in contact with me and I haven't been too responsive, that's why.  I wake up at 6 am M-F, drive him to work, I then get ready and go to school or work, and then as soon as I am out, I rush to go pick him up and trust me, driving all day, working with kids, doing schoolwork, it's exhausting!!  Haha.  But trust me, it will be different soon, promise.  But it is fantastic, it's nice to see how it would be when we decide to move in together (which yes, we have talked about and hopefully might happen sometime this year) and it's pretty sweet.

I miss Tara very much.  I think she really needs to come and visit EXTREMELY soon or the end of summer needs to come like now for her and Mark to be back on the main land haha.  I need my biffle in my life.

So yea, that's a pretty big update in my life I guess.  I hope everyone is doing great, I truly love and appreciate all of my true friends so much.  Life is great and love is even greater.

"event","Hey guys.  This has been one out of control weekend.

Yesterday Cory and I were heading to dinner with my family and on SR84 and Pine Island, some asshole ran a red light.  I saw him, thank God, screamed at Cory and he sped up.  The guy hit Cory's left rear side and we 360'd in the middle of the intersection.  Both of us are physically fine.  The person kept going.  Nothing from them.  There wasn't even any hesitation on there part, they didn't brake, swerve, nothing.  I am fine and so is Cory.  We're just shaken up.  But I feel terrible, Cory's car wasn't even a week old!  He had it for 6 fucking days and this fucking prick ruined it.  Now Cory has to pay $1000 deductible to get it fixed and his insurance is going to go up.  I feel so awful, poor thing.  He doesn't deserve this shit.  He has a perfect driving record and he is so responsible.

So to you, stupid ass green Dodge Caravan (that's the most we could get out of it) I hope you fucking die and burn in hell.  I am actually kind of glad you didn't stop cause Cory would have fucking slaughtered the guy and if it was a girl, I am not kidding, I woulda thrown a beat down.  Drivers are so fucking irresponsible.  That person had to have been drunk or on drugs cause there was NOTHING from there part and that stupid cuntrag just kept driving.  I seriously hope their car exploded on them and they died all fiery and slowly.  Everything just sucks, insurance sucks and justice definitely sucks.  No cameras and apparently the cop told us even if there were cameras, since it wasn't a fatal accident, they couldn't look on them.  What the fuck is the point of having the cameras then?!?!  What a great fucking legal system we have!  And the cop couldn't write on the report that the guy ran a red light since there are no cameras and since NO ONEpulled over to help or speak as a witness!  There were like 25 cars waiting at the RED LIGHT THAT THAT ASSHOLE RAN and they saw it all, us fucking 360ing out of control, and nobody came and helped.  I am just so dissapointed and shooken up by everything.

All I do know is that I am soooo fucking glad I saw that guy.  If I didn't see him and we kept the normal speed we were at, the van would have pummeled right into Cory and he would have been in the hospital and I cannot tell you the anger and depression that would have came over me.  I would have fucking killed that person driving.

I just want everyone to know we are fine and everything, it just sucks that such horrible things happen to such good people.

Fuck you Caravan, seriously, I hate your fucking guts.  I hope your babies come out defected.  If you're even lucky enough to have babies.  Stupid cunt."

I never update on here and everytime I rarely do, I always say I am gonna try and start too more.  But really, from now on, I really am gonna try.  Haha.

I have been pretty happy lately.  Well, besides a few bumps in the road as always, but in the end, life's boring without some bumps.  Family has proven so much to me and not in a good way.  It is not a good feeling when someone gives you the impression of being a burden.  I am your child, you had me for a reason.  And siblings, pfft.  It is kinda sad when you are struggling and you've been doing so much and working so hard and no one in your immediate fam is willing to help you, but the damn second they need a favor and you decline, you are scum of the earth.  I am done trying to please family.  I am making myself happy.  That's what is most important.

I just wanna say now, I take all responsibilities for all the decisions I make in my life.  It has NOTHING to do with who I have been with lately or anything of that nature.  People like to jump to conclusions quickly or say I have ""changed"" because of him.  it is not true.  I don't do things because I do not want too, plain and simple.  Or because I'd rather see my nephew or other things like that.  I still love and adore all my friends and yes, I have not seen everyone that often and I apologize.  But it hard when you work a lot and you do not have a car.  Apparently my car is fixed, I just need new tires so hopefully soon, it will be a little more hanging out time.  But do not assume anything, because I make decisions based on me, myself and I.  But gimmie a call kids, drop me a line, I am not a stranger and those who have hung out with me or talked to me lately can vouch for that.

I am glad my whole tooth infection drama is over.  It is a major reality check when it comes to money and friends and time and insurance.  This world is fucking nuts and you can only help yourself and find out the true ones from the fake ones.  God blessed me with Dr. Salamen.  I cannot thank him and his staff enough for saving my life pretty much.  It is kinda scary to think that if I would have held off for a few more days or been told another bullshit theory, that I could have wound up in the hospital, possibly dying from a brain infection.  You better damn believe I brush AND floss daily, sometimes twice or more.  Your teeth can fuck up so much of your body, take care of em kids.

My 21st birthday is in 10 days and I could not be more excited.  Cory surprised me with a trip to Marco Island for that weekend.  I cried when he told me.  I've seriously never had someone do a birthday surprise for me like that.  We got a room at the Hilton and it's right on the water and our room has a private balcony with a Gulf view.  I am stoked.  Then the weekend after having a BDay dinner with all those invited, PLEASE COME OUT IF YOU CAN.  And then the first weekend of November is Disney with Cory.  I am so excited to feel like a little kid with him.  Staying at the PopCentury Resort and getting Hopper passes and going drinking and shopping and such.  I am so excited.  It is my Golden 21st so it needs to be a hit.

This is gonna KINDA be like my last myspace blog but kinda not.

Lately I have been catching up with a lot of people and whenever they ask me how everything is, it's so good to say GREAT.  I mean, family shit is NOT good, but that has ALWAYS been a problem and I am done with it.  I am done being completely sad or depressed or whatever because I have shitty fam.  I have the GREATEST friends ever, things are looking up for my job AND I love everything that's been happening lately.  I seriously have been having a blast lately, thanks thanks thanks.

But the truth is, my fam is ridiculous lately.  I cannot handle that the few people you're ""supposed"" to truth with your life are so betraying.  My sister and I will NEVER be close, and I seriously am absolutely fine with that.  Hell, when I move out, I know we will prolly never talk again.  And I could care less, cause the truth is, she has made so many times in my life absolutely miserable.  So whatever.  I am just looking past their bullshit now.  And I am happy I can do that and not let it affect me anymore.

I am 21 in 2 months, fuck fuck fuck.  Haha.  I feel so old.  But I am damn happy.  I cannot believe it is so close.  And time is passing by so quickly.  Like, I cannot believe it is the end of the summer.  Like, shit, that was quick.  Everyone is coming back from tour this week and I am SOOOO excited to see them all and hear all the amazing stories.  Yay yay yay.

I am just babbling right now, haha.  I have nothing else to do.  Actually, it is 10:05, time to shower and get ready for my trial shift at the tanning salon.  Wish me luck!  Haha.  Later kids.

PS-everyone i havent seen lately, we NEED to make it happen!  haha.  <3"

I haven't written in here in awhile and I honestly miss the hell out of it.  I remember junior & senior year, I could not live without writing in here at least 5 times a week, haha.  Now I go weeks without writing in it and that makes me sad.

Stuff lately is pretty damn amazing.  I am just having as much fun as possible day to day.  Me and Ashley go to New York in 11 fucking days and I could not be more excited.  Her daddy already got us RENT tickets, woot woot.  I am going with close to $700 so I am excited to shop my little booty off.  Still gotta figure out time to visit my Benny boy at PennState cause I miss him more than life.  But yea, me and Ash are pretty damn excited.

I just think everyone should know there is this boy named Cory Deal and he has become one of my best friends ever.  I adore him so much.  He makes me smile.  And just that, is enough.  Yay.

I am so over lame ass managers.  You want me to be a ""good"" employee, which I already am,  then act like a good manager.  Not a queen, not a priss and not a drama maker.  And don't openly say you talk shit about your employees, it makes you look even lower than you already are, cunt.  Thanks! =)

So many things to look forward too.  This year is going by so quickly and I must say, so far, it is fucking incredible.  Harry Potter movie on Tuesday with my Lia, some plans with Cory on the weekend prolly, Tuesday night with Cory, WEDNESDAY NEW YORK WITH MY BFFFFFFFFFF and while I am in NY, RENT HAIRSPRAY FUN FAMILY BEN SHOPPING TATTOOS yay yay yay!!!!  God I am so excited.  I turn 21 in 4 months, YES 4 MONTHS, woot woot.  Major party gonna be planned for that weekend and then, 2nd weekend of Nov, Cory is taking me to Disney for it!  Yayyyyy.

I am just so happy right now.  Seriously.  Thank you, please keep it this way for a loooooong time.

I LOVE YOU ALL.

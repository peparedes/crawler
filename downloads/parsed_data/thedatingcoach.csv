Heisenberg's Principle of Uncertainty is applicable in all cases where you're uncertain about a relationship - where you start asking are you crazy or are games being played, etc...

The essence of the Principle of Uncertainty lies in two things: 1, that we cannot know both the location and the direction of a particle (or for our uses, a relationship) and 2, that the mere act of observing prevents us from knowing this - because to observe, we must apply some sort of energy to it, which then changes the direction.

So, we cannot know both where we stand in a relationship and where it's going.  Because as soon as we identify it, we have changed it.  We can only have a rough idea.  

In essence what I'm saying is that it's futile to obsess over the status of a relationship.

"event","Dear Dating Coach,

I don't know how to transition the date from the mean idea, such as dinner or bowling, etc... to something afterwards to another activity, there could be suggestion of movies and what not but that's not conducive to talking and what not... what are some activities to do and how do I bring them up for a successful well rounded date?

Please help,
Dating Challenged

Dear Challenged,

Okay, here's the general rule of dating that frequently gets ignored.  Food and drinks?  At the END of the date.  Why?  Because that part is the MOST conducive to talking (except for a nice walk, I'll get to that).  Always begin the date with the activity least conducive.  If you're going to suggest something when asking, suggest an activity.  Dinner shouldn't be suggested.  Unless it's a blind date, and even then - suggest meeting for drinks, if it goes well, move ON to dinner.  Dinner is acceptable if you've been dating for a while, but even then, throw in a nice activity.  You can sometimes get away with an activity after dinner - golfing, bowling, etc, but unless it's specifically a later night activity (glow in the dark mini golf for example), go with the activity first.

Why activity first?  Because then, when you're sitting and eating, you have something to start talking about.  It provides you with an instant springboard for conversation.  It's up to you to keep it going, but if the conversation starts to lull, you can always bring up another aspect of it.  Don't do dinner and a movie, do a movie and dinner.  

If the activity goes well, say ""hey I'm hungry, can I buy you dinner?"" 

If dinner goes well, say ""you up for some coffee?""

If coffee is going well, say ""Hey, it's a really nice night, you want to take a walk instead of sitting here with these?""

Or ""Hey Saturday Night Live is almost on, want to come over and watch it?"" Or ""You want to come back to my place and watch ______ (insert movie you've already slipped into conversation that she has admitted to wanting to see)?""

(The movie at the end of a date is different from a movie at the beginning because the movie at the end is a video or DVD and the movie at the beginning is in a theatre.  This is so you can hook up.  Or let her admire your furniture.  Whatever.)

So basically, the rules of transition are: 1) go from less-talking activities to more-talking activities to activities that allow for hooking up.
2) It's within the rules to ask your date to the next activity if the date is going well, so ASK.
3) Sometimes a longer date is just moving to fast or too serious for some people.  So they might say no.  It doesn't mean they don't like you and don't want to go on another date with you (not necessarily, anyways).  It just means that they need to move at a different pace.  So respect it.  Don't give them the cold shoulder.  

Peace,

Your Dating Coach"

"event","Dear Dating Coach,

I've been seeing this guy since the end of September.  We both have very demanding jobs (I routinely work fourteen hours a day, and his schedule leads him frequently to long business dinners and business trips around the country).  Because of this, it's very hard to find time to spend together.  I really like him, but because it's so hard to see each other, I feel like he must be seeing someone else.  I've asked him point blank, and while he doesn't want to be exclusive yet, he also says he's not seeing anyone else.  

In addition, I feel like sex has put additional pressure on our relationship.  I'm not the type to fall into bed when I meet a guy at a bar, and he said he'd wait for me.  But now that I'm ready, we had a serious incident of malfunction (that neither of us can adequately explain, because we were both doing ""our part"").  Since then, we haven't tried again, though I'm perfectly willing.

I can't conclusively say that he's ""the one"" (we've only seen each other half a dozen times) but I do really like him.  He only has one irritating habit, and that is constantly text-messaging instead of picking up the phone.  When we're apart, he doesn't call to make plans - at best, he'll text me to ask what I'm doing that night.

I'm confused and getting mixed signals from him.  My girlfriends alternate between telling me I'm crazy and telling me he's a jerk.  I need answers, and that book ""He's just not that into you"" is really depressing.

Plus, he recently gave me a toothbrush for when I stay over.  It doesn't seem to make any sense.

Dear Lovelorn,

Wow.  You sure can pick 'em.  When you reached for the man-platter, someone should have smacked your hand.  I'm going to try to deal with your issues one by one.

Scheduling:  A fourteen hour workday?  What do you do, work in the ER?  It sounds like you've got alot on your plate right now.  Are you sure you're really in the market for a serious relationship?  Not that it can't be done, but you really need to consider how it's going to fit in with the rest of your life.  If you're trying to squeeze him in whenever you're free to compensate for the fact that you spend so much time working, you have to realize that it's possible he's not ready to squeeze you into all of HIS free time.  

Exclusivity:  That fact that he doesn't want to be exclusive yet further points to the idea that he's simply not ready for a serious relationship with you.  Since he's been up front about that, we'll give him some credit and bet that he's not seeing someone else.  (By the way, girl, you need to curve the paranoia unless you have hard evidence.  It will just make you both crazy.)  But you do have to realize that you're not the same person.  He's got different priorities, one of which seems to be the need to have time without you.  And that's okay.  You don't seem to be at that stage of your relationship yet, although it seems like you'd like to be.  I feel like this is a case of ""getting your life together"" syndrome.  We always focus on the aspect of our lives that is the most problematic, so when we really just want a better lifestyle (ie. maybe less hours at work for you) we try to ""fix"" ourselves by putting that last building block in place.  This is how women who otherwise have it all together end up with really strange high-fashion haircuts.  We think we can go from nothing to something huge, when the truth of life is that to accomplish anything requires we take baby steps.  Maybe you have no reason to be unhappy with your relationship other than the fact that it's not yet in full bloom.  These things take time, and not two months worth of time, either.  Years.

Sex:  Talk about it.  Pretending it's nothing isn't going to get you laid.  Address the issue - fight about it, even - since you can't seem to assign blame, but TALK.  To be fair, a sexual problem would probably be the first thing I'd walk away from in a relationship as new as yours, but since you really like him, TALK.  And then try jumping his bones in some sexy lingerie.

The One:  The problem again seems to be that you're serious and he's not.  This isn't a problem I can offer you a solution for.  You only have choices.  Either he becomes serious, or you become casual.  Because that seems to be the fundamental problem for you here.  You third choice is to break up, but it doesn't seem like you want to do that.  You can not, however, continue as you are.  It's not a healthy relationship.  You're giving and he's taking.  You can waste alot of your own time and emotions on someone who will never give you what you deserve in return.  But it won't make you happy, though it may fill up your time.  But why merely fill your time when you could be out finding Mr. Actually Right instead?  This is stopping you from finding something real.

Friends:  Your friends just want to stay your friends.  They're your friends because they're supportive (like all good friends are), but they appear to be torn here.  On the one hand, they want to be supportive.  On the other, it really seems like this is not a good relationship.  Perhaps they're trying to give you good advice without upsetting you.  In any case, you shouldn't be asking them, because it's not like they're unbiased observers.  They'll tell you what you need to hear, but always temper it with what you want to hear.  You need to learn to be honest with yourself about what you want and whether you think you're going to get it from this relationship.  There's no hemming and hawing, no allowing for 'mixed signals'.  Just base it on hard experience with him.  You WANT him to be more serious.  But will he be able to give that to you in the NEAR FUTURE?

I agree that ""He's just not that into you"" can be depressing.  But you're not into everyone who's into you, so why should everyone you're into be into you?  You need to lighten up on the seriousness levels.  It is not life or death if someone likes you.  Eventually, you'll find someone who likes you just as much as you like them.  Don't let it affect how happy you are in the rest of your life.  Try to just have fun, there's nothing wrong with you, these things just take time.

Toothbrush: Says casual relationship to me - it's too early to really mean something.

Sincerely, 
Your Dating Coach"

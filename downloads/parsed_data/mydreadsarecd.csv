"event","yeah so i haven't written in here in a while.  but wow, so much is changing, so quickly.  it's such a relief too - the changes are good.  for the longest time i was depressed about everything, and i didn't even know why.  i have a pretty good life, lots of blessings, good friends, so it didn't make sense why i should have such a crummy attitude.  i still haven't quite figured it all out yet, but you know what i realized?  i don't have to.  it's ok to not understand.  that's a tough lesson to learn all in its own, but man, it is so worth it.  but as for the stuff i do understand.... i realize now how selfish i've been.  today my friend casually asked me, ""don't you like making people happy?""  wow.  it really hit me.  my answer?  ""um...i guess..."" (as in, no, f the world, i don't care about anyone else.)  how stupid of me!  last night at church, our pastor said, ""in order to be happy, it's not about what you receive but what you give.""  no wonder i'm not happy!  all along i've been so wrapped up in people are treating me wrong, not getting what i want, my struggles.  ME ME ME!  i really messed up.  i feel like such a jerk.  so, to all of you who i have hurt, i am deeply sorry, and i hope you can accept my apology.  i honestly care about people, but i've obviously gotten mixed up somewhere along the way of prioritizing the objects of my affection.  and hey, pmsing doesn't help much either.  you can ask nicole about that one....yesterday was hell, eh?  anyway, i have plenty of homework to attend to, so away i go."

"event","so, hmm, the past few days have been rather interesting.  i hate being moody.  i really don't understand myself, and it's driving me nuts.  i'll wake up and be in the most pissy mood ever, and then suddenly i'll start thinking about how blessed i am.  or, i'll wake up really happy and blow up at the tiniest little thing.  it f-ing sucks.  and it's weird - i know i have control over myself, but i really feel like i don't - like i'm just being ruled by my physical desires, and they're laughing in my face.  meanies.  and....i don't know.  i just don't know.  do you ever have something really bugging you, and you just can't figure out what the heck it is?  yeah, i have that happen ALL THE TIME.  it's crazy.  there are things that i can think of that seem like they would piss me off, and i think oh that must be it, but i really don't feel pissed about them.  it's so confusing! ahhhhhh!!!!  but then i think, hmm, maybe it's just time for another visit from aunt flo.  whoopie.  whatever it is, i wish it would just go away, because i seriously hate moodiness.  if i were someone else and i saw myself act this way, i would yell at me.  and...yeah.... i'm just rambling about... i don't even know.... i just needed to vent, but i think i'm done now.  don't think i'm a freak, i'm just under the influence of something very strong - it's called hormones.  i'll be back to normal pretty soon...."

"event","so this morning i woke up and i was actually happy.  happy and morning, wow, those words just don't go together, but today was a rare exception.  but of course as all good things, my happy mood was short-lived as, when i got to work, i found out that wayne just got fired.  NOO!!!!  i am going to miss him so much.  he was awesome.  he was the only normal, funny, young guy there - even so he's 11 years older than me - but people at my work drive me nuts most of the time, and he could totally relate.  well, woo hoo, now i'm all alone with a bunch of old psycho people, aside from my brother, but he doesn't count because....he's my brother.  and his weirdness is greater than everyone there combined.  

so, let me tell you about the odd group of misfits i work with.  

phyllis is the old lady who sits by the bathroom mumbling to herself and getting in EVERYONE'S business.  seriously, you gotta whisper if you don't want her in your face.  she kind of looks like a poodle/dinsosaur.  poof hair and srawny arms with curled up claws on the end of them.  yeah, that's phyllis.  

then there's glenda, the front desk lady who's got a million personal problems and shares them with the world.  she spends most of her time gossiping on the phone or internet, or running her kids places.  she thinks she's got psychology stuff all figured out.  hah.  she's really hairy and sweats a lot... the only thing she's got going for her is her decent looking fake nails.  

ah, my boss, jim.  he's pretty cool for the most part, but he always gives me this weird look.  i can't tell if it means ""i'm impressed with your work"" or ""you're about to be fired.""  one time i wore this faux-suede bucket hat to work, and ever since he's called me bucket.  he once told me that people always make fun of those that they like, so, i guess that's a good thing?

so yeah, that's a peephole into my office.  you pretty much have to be crazy to work there, so i guess in a way i fit right in.  i just hope i'm not THAT weird....more later, maybe...."

"event","ah, what an eventful day so far.  i pissed off a friend.  because i was honest.  i really don't understand that.  i guess i suck at being social, but hey, i'm blunt, i tell it like it is.  is that such a bad thing?  here's honesty: i can be a bitch.  so what?  regardless of whether the fact is said or not, it still remains. so why not say it and get it out in the open?  i think that's the main problem.  people are afraid of being open.  they're afraid of letting people see what they think is safe from the world.  but guess what - people aren't that different.  things that we hide, 50 million other people hide too.  we're all going through similar things.  so i say, why not just let it out and make it known to the world, so we can be closer, relate better, and learn from each other?  after all, if you think about it, that's really being social, isn't it?  they say that a true friend tells you what you don't want to hear.  that's what i do, and that's what i am.  i care for my friends deeply, as long as i'm not taken advantage of.  that's me.  if you don't like me, i'm not apologizing, i am who i am.  if you think i'm rude, i'm sorry, i don't try to be.  if you have something you want to say to me, tell me, and i'll be totally willing to talk.  
but anyway, i'm venting.  i do that a lot.  i have to get stuff off my chest.  holding it in just makes you go crazy, doesn't it?  i guess that's why i like being open.  and admitting my faults.  everyone has them and sees them, so why try to keep them hidden?  i confess, i am judgemental, pessimistic, disrespectful, and just plain rude a lot of times.  and i confess i'm human.  not that that is an excuse for all sin, but just realize that no one is perfect.  i saw this one saying i really liked.  it said, ""strive for excellence, not perfection.""  is that great or what?  striving for excellence is all you can do.  

thank God he doesn't expect us to be perfect."

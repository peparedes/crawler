"event","I got some great news today! 
I might be staying in Atlanta for an xtra 6 months.
This would be very good, because I have really started to like it here in Atlanta.
I found a web cam on my friends, friend-list, and met a few people from Livejournal.
They looked like they were having a lot of fun.

I do miss my friends in Germany, but I know they are happy for me to have this opportunity.  I will probably travel back to Bonn in April for two weeks.
I'll have to give Alexandria a call so that we can hang out then."

"event","I spent most of the day with my new atlanta friends, David and Rebbeca.  They were crazy and I drank a lot. I notice that I do that when I am in Atlanta.  Screwdrivers are my downfall!!

we went to a couple of parties and I got to dance!!

Still waking up, I'll type more later."

"event","I am somewhat new here in Atlanta, 
I moved here from Germany maybe three months ago, I don't have alot of Atlanta friends yet.  I like the city pretty good, though.  I am hoping that this journal will help me write better English sentences.  A Friend of mine set this up for me."

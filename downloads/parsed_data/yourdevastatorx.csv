tour update 3:

the show in rochester was alright. not the best turnout but the kids who were there were into it. after the show we had an 8 hour drive in indiana.

so we left rochester around 10 and had a long, boring, flat drive through new york, pennsylvania, ohio and into indiana. somewhere in ohio around 3 am we stopped to get gas and food. we ended up dancing around the rest stop to 90's rock songs for awhile and then got subway. while we were getting out sandwiches there was a big giant fat man with sweatpants on, wearing no underwear with a giant rip in the buttcheek. that made my night. 

we got to the venue in indiana at around 6 am. so we all decided to crash there. we got up at around 11 and the guy came and fixed our windshield at like 12. the show didnt start till like 3. the kids there were kind of assholes because we had horns so they werent into it. since the flood was kinda meh, too pure to die was dump but they played a pantera cover and it ruled, first blood was good and the warriors were awesome. first blood just kinda stood there and i was a little bit disappointed in their performance.

after the show we stayed at ethan's friends house. it was a farm with 4 dogs, some cats, a horse or two, chickens, geese and goats. the kids there were shitty and lame. i got made fun of for not listening to ska hahaha. crashed there and in the morning our bus was filled with flies. 

drove after that drove to michigan. stopped at another subway that was way overpriced, had a drive-thru and had a man wearing plaid pants. got to the venue in jackson, michigan. show kinda sucked. went to matt wixsons house and his parents had a feast for us to eat. matt covey and i passed out watching history of the world, pt I. woke up and chilled til we bbq'd. 

were playing with ruiner and die young tonight and its gonna be awesome. i cant wait!"

"event","tour update 2

staed at steves house again. that ruled. woke up real early to drive to buffalo to play some kickball. we got there and a bunch of little kids come out of the house.so of course we think that this is gonna be the easiest game ever. we go down to the field and of course theyre fucking ringers. we ended up losing 8-6. so we go back to the kids house and is mom has this crazy feast with heros and vegan sandwiches and just everything ever. so after we eat the kids wanted to take a picture. we tell them to hop on the top of the bus so OF COURSE they walk across the windshield and it fucking broke. the kids mom gave us money for it but we dont have time to get it fixed until indiana.

the show in buffalo was pretty good. it was a shit bar but it was pretty packed and kids were into it. BUFFALO AS JUGGALOS EVERYWHERE.

we stayed at johns friend from college's apartment in niagra falls. kinda small but nice. she was very nice to us and let us make stir fry.


now i gonna go shit and get dressed and go to rochester."

"event","tour has been fun so far. yesterday was albany. kristen came and saw me and that was just awesome. the show was alright. we stayed at this kid steve's house. he let us use his hot tub and eat all his food and play with his cute dogs. his cat tried to sleep on my head. i wasn't down with that.


tonight was syracuse. it was some SHITTY bands last show and i wanna die. they've been playing for over an hour and they're not even close to done. some dump band from canada never showed up so TFT went on earlier than they should have. i'm sitting behind the merch table bored out of my mind. this band is doing like 4 days with us and their singer is a wicked cute girl. i should try to put it in her."

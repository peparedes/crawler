"event","This is my first Christmas, since Ken and I broke up...
And I'm always a little home-sick, especially this time of year, but it's a little lonely - Kyleen's been staying with Grandma for the past week or so, and will be there for a bit longer until Ken and I work out something stable for her.  (And stop being quite so angry with each other)

So...  for entertainment's sake, here are a few of the things that made me laugh from the Trinidadian-LJ group I joined today.

An animated introduction to <a href=""http://www.repo-opera.com"">Repo: The Genetic Opera</a> - Or, as their website describes it, ""This is <b>not</b> your parents' opera!""

To the squeamish, perhaps the animated version will convey the movie's gruesomeness in a distant enough fashion to explain my new addiction without having to worry about getting queasy by the realistic street-surgery entailed within the movie itself.  (I do have a few squeamish-types friended to this LJ, so trying to be considerate of the non-violent among us)

I have no words for how much I love this movie.

But if you like Sarah Brightman's voice, you will not want to miss her songs here, and if you are anything but white-bread brain-dead ""normal"", you will <b>love</b> this film!  This is the song, Chase the Morning, but it's not a music video - it's a clip from the movie...  the whole movie has the larger-than-life music-video-meets-horror-movie operatic <b>feel</b> to it that I love!

Responsible mother, who hasn't seen her daughter in over two weeks...  (Yeah, babysat tonight - i.e. went to sleep in the other room; the girls were already asleep; so still haven't seen Ky)

Mothering wins out every time, but the conflicted part is because I can't be sure that my perspective that I <b>need</b> to be with Kyleen this weekend (which is the precursor - the given - to why it is that she then obviously can't be in the middle of that mess if Philly has one of it's infamous riots) is for her own good or for mine.  To clarify, since that sentence looks a little convoluted, even to me - not asking advice.  Just venting, and putting my thoughts down in writing, so that hopefully in the morning, things will look a little clearer."

K&j to go out and have fun; I stay over to watch things.

No sign of j.
No response to query.
So I go home.

I am only now using that photo set because Ken and Jezz have been busy at work, and they do my photos and photo editing.

I've been in Florida for the past week.

And before that, I had to deal with Ken's father's cancer treatments.

So no - the universe still doesn't revolve around you.


I'm not saying you've taken anything of mine.
I'm saying both of us are missing things, and I'm not getting pissy about it.
I never said you two were ""apparently *SO* fucking crazy for accusing her of stealing"" - I said it was hurtful, since I didn't accuse you two (or anyone) when my things went missing, and yet that was the first assumption you both leapt to.  So easily too.  Which is why I wondered in the yahoo group what our entire partnership was based on, because friendships and trust don't fracture quite that easily.

As for the various other points:
1.  An inability to measure is fine - my showing you over the course of an entire day and your doing it incorrectly is referred to as a mistake because you learned how to do it.  If that is what you refer to as wielding something ""like some sort of sword"", what do you think your entire post above and in response to my answer, look like to me?
2. I've taken you out to dinner, and bought you drinks when I don't drink alcohol - I never once asked you for money back for gas when driving you around in the years I've known you - Speculation about a student's crush does not pedophilia make - And yes, you are great at helping your friends, and you are amazingly quick to cut people off and assume the worst of them too.  At least, that's what it seems to me, as I've known you for about five years I think, and this is the first bit of conflict I've had with either one of you, and yet you were both willing to simply jump to conclusions, and assume my speculations were excuses rather than trying to figure out what happened without pointless accusations.

As for your last point...
That's nice - you both simply ceased talking to me - how am I supposed to know what's going on, when all I hear from you both is snippy comments in your blogs, and absolutely no direct contact?  So no, not ""thanks to (me)"".

Not psychic.
Already said I'd pay you both.
Not my problem if your pride made that difficult.

As I mentioned several times, the offer still stands - it always has.
If you both prefer the legal route, that is certainly up to you.
I've made several attempts at an olive branch, but you both seem convinced that I <b>must</b> admit to stealing things I didn't.

If I swiped simple things like tools, and whatever you two are convinced is missing, wouldn't it have been simpler to just drop them off at the space and go ""Oops?""

I can't say it in any smaller words:
I.
Didn't.
Take.
Your.
Things!"

Cute-without-being-pretty, suffering vampire, with a prediliction for single-malt scotch and romance.  And violence.  Mmmmm

<a href=""http://alpha.cbs.com/primetime/moonlight/recaps/ep101/"">Episode 1</a>
<a href=""http://alpha.cbs.com/primetime/moonlight/recaps/ep102/"">Episode 2</a>
Thank you, CBS, for putting the past episodes on your website."

"event","Scraped my foot all to hell at the pool yesterday morning...
It's actually kind of funny, in hindsight.

Got a good rush going...  nothing like cutting through the water.
All of a sudden, there's a shape moving into my peripheral vision.

I cut to the side, to avoid hitting an old lady.
And promptly catch my foot in the pool ladder, banging (and tearing skin from) the middle toe of my left foot on the underside of one of the steps.

It stings, and I hate injuring my feet, because it almost never happens so it's a near-blinding pain when it does happen, since it's very much a sensation I'm not used to.

But a few deep breaths (and much apologies from the elderly water-therapy group I share the pool with in the wee hours of the morning, and many thanks from the lady I had the near-miss with), and I just kept going for the rest of the hour.

Good thing too...
Turns out the chlorine kept it from bleeding until I got to the showers, and then blood all over the shower stall floor.

Really don't need to think about shower floor germs.
Just really glad I wear flip flops there.  :-p

Further investigation shows a nice, thick vein <i>just</i> under the surface.
Another fraction of a millimeter, and I'd have probably been bleeding right into the pool.
And they just cleaning it Friday.

Hehe...
Shark trails, I don't need.

So now I'm trying to figure out the rest of my day, sans excessive walking.
I can walk.  I can stand.  Flexing my toes is a bad idea, and even the subway vibration was painful yesterday.
But we'll see.

No swimming today, of course, but hopefully I'll be back on track tomorrow.
Maybe get a pack of waterproof band-aids?
:-p"

"event","There's something poignant about a muppet that represented so many innocent things to children everywhere singing a song that so many teenagers and young adults can probably relate to.

I'm just posting this here because I like it...
I promise, I'm not making any sort of statement.  :-p


(Well...  maybe a little one)

"event","No, not for work purposes (although that'd be funny...  drive up, past the people-as-statues and the huge chess match with people in armor)...

But I love animals - I'd choose fake fur over real fur any day of the week (example being My new faux-ivory mink coat that I adore and hope to arrive any day now - thanks, random fanboy!!!)

And I am now missing Wolf something awful (for anyone who hasn't paid attention...  he was done being resocialized early, and was adopted by a loving family who'd lost their husky to old age a year or two ago...  got pictures from the last snow-fall of Wolf running outside with his mouth open - a huge backyard makes for a much happier dog)...  so I came across this website browsing for exotic pets...

http://www.juliesjungle.com/nigeriangoat.php - cute little lawn mowers...  and cuddly too!

http://www.juliesjungle.com/caracals.php - I miss My ocelots!  (Look them up, silly boys - they aren't endangered back home)

http://www.juliesjungle.com/fennecfox.php - Like purse dogs (think Paris Hilton's little yappy critter), but smart...  and actually cute!

And knowing just how much these babies cost, and how much it will cost to have a house and land, and proper habitation for these cuties...  Serious, I'm going to start a church of my own and start tithing My worshippers!







No - seriously!"

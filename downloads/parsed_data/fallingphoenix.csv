"event","Odd little things I've been saying lately.

Threats of pain/violence:
""[Go/I hope you] die in a fire.""
""I am not above knocking you out, skinning you alive with a cheese grater, then drawing pictures on what's left with a sharpie.""  (variant of something thiefed from the interwebz)
""I wish I had reason to think I could actually kick yer ass.""

Being flattered:
""Aaaw, yer such a charming liar.  Bless yer heart.""  (I've clearly been in the south too long)

On being the bigger person:
(assorted variants of) ""Just once, I'd really love to get what I want, and say 'fuck the other guy' damnit. . .""

About men:
""Sometimes I just wanna lick 'em.""
""I figured out why men are stupid.  Hormones make the IQ drop.  I need to stop hanging around decent guys who are also fun to look at.  It's new to me, I can't handle it!""

Misc:
""Yay!               What are we talking about?"""

2  - No matter how good my intentions are to take care of my car, it can and will break in some silly way.  Or not so silly, as the case often will be.
3  - The phrase ""it wasn't meant to be"" is bullshit almost always uttered by someone who a) was in a less then perfect situation they didn't wanna work through or b) said by someone who dun have the guts to come out and hurt someone directly.
4  - I'm posting this on livejournal, and it shows up on Facebook.  Kinda cool, huh?  Rawr.
5  - Earthquakes are not as bad as people who aren't used to them think they are.
6  - Hurricanes ARE as bad as people thing, cuz they are like clockwork every year. . .
7  - There is no shame in wanting others to be happy.  However, the right personality tpes need to learn to make themselves happy too.
8  - My cat Ritz wins at life.
9  - There will always be that one coworker you wouldn't mind having spontaneously combust.  Assuming of course they are far enough away to not be a mess in your work space.
10 - Melon is still a tad putrid.  It has no right to call itself a fruit and needs to be punished.

"event","So yeah.&nbsp; I don't post here so much lately.&nbsp; But!&nbsp; After a quiet night of moderate forums lurking, I stumble across a reminder of a great truth?&nbsp; Well, perhaps not GREAT, but it makes me laugh.&nbsp; Either with or at the poster?&nbsp; The world may never know.&nbsp; <br /><br />To Quote:<br /><i><span class=""postbody"">Whenever I get a package of plain M&amp;Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels. <br /> <br />Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them breaks and splinters. That is the &quot;loser,&quot; and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. <br /> <br />I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. <br /> <br />Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. <br /> <br />When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3x5 card reading, &quot;Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.&quot; <br /> <br />This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms. I consider this &quot;grant money.&quot; I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. <br /> <br />There can be only one.</span></i>"

"event","Okay here we go. . .  I feel this has to be done.  Public documentation, so I can't be misquoted later and further made into a bad guy for the wrong reasons.  I'm used to being the one who's always wrong even if I am not, so whatever. . .  Just want to provide the accurate reason for people to think ill of me? heh   Sounds good enough.  

So!  People who know me in the real world, or at least know me well enough to know where to send emails. . .  PLEASE feel free to do so if you have anything to ask me.  Communication through a third party seems (to me at least) just a little bit disrespectful.  Only somewhat so to me, mind you.  But involving extra people?  Why?  There's no point to it if it is not required.  If by chance you feel that you shouldn't be asking me directly because you want to think I'd never respond in your favor, or I can't handle being civil, I want to suggest a trip to the closest mirror.  Perhaps it isn't just me you should worry about.  

So maybe that sentence wasn't so nice, but I can't say I enjoy hearing about possible assumptions people seem to make about me.  The way I see it, if people can't work up the nerve to ask anyone something directly (e-mail, aim, and telephone works versus a real life conversation if needed) then they don't deserve an answer.  This applies to anyone about anything, methinks.

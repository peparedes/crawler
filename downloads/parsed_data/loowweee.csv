"event","Oh Valentine's Day, I always thought you were a cruel joke, but you've redeemed yourself in my book.

Spent it with wonderful people. Had an *edible* dinner cooked by our very own Charley Mann and Sean Ordway. It was even what you could call ""delicious."" Both of our favorite Irish men were all done up, and I have to say the two clean up well. I was proud, and me and Jackie showed them off all the way to the movies. Good food, great movie, even better friends. Couldn't have asked for anything more..

Perhaps a Marilyn Monroe purse, complete with sparkles and a zest of style?
Oh wait, got that too. St. Valentine, you are too good to me.

Today I stayed home from school and got some much needed sleep, which was sweet. Sean came over around 2:30, and we made a quick get away to the grassy fields of Locks Point. It was then we realized that the sunshine and fishing poles could only mean one thing: It's almost time for crabbing again! Shit yea, we crab.

I'm gettin sick of the cold weather. So sick that I think I might have too high of hopes for the summer. But then again, last summer sure as hell didn't let me down- they just keep gettin better.



Fireband7: i love you, holly lowe



sean ordway, you're perfect. in an imperfect, emo boy sort of way."

<P>Aahhhhh today was wonderful, as spending time with my beautiful boyfriend, Jackie Anne and Charley usually is- except when Charley tells me I'm a feminist and says&nbsp;to get in the kitchen and cook him some food. Charley Mann, you are doomed to girl troubles for the rest of your life.</P>
<P>Woke up at 7 to go out to Indian River High and support GB Theater Company in Regionals. They're play was amazing again, and I don't think there's anything better than goofin around with a bunch of drama geeks for hours and hours-I won't lie. Or maybe it's just being with Sean, I don't know. He makes me laugh and is the only boy I know who can pull off a can of hairspray.</P>
<P>Great Bridge won once again, and I am super happy for them 'cause they're all crazy talented. Moulan Rouge medleys? I'm down. Little bit of Queen? Bring it on.&nbsp;Fresh Prince&nbsp;theme song?&nbsp;Piece of cake.</P>
<P>&nbsp;After screaming and cheering and all that jazz, we all rolled out. Sean and I went to Brittney's for her birthday gathering. Appearantly Brittney likes her cakes LARGE AND IN CHARGE, and the one she had just wasn't going to do. So Kaila, Marissa, Sean and I ran out and picked the kid up a big, crazy icecream cake.&nbsp;No one can bust out a Killers duet like he and I, it's truth.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Then Sean and I spent the night just driving around and ran into Wallace and Spencer, which was super sweet 'cause I miss those fags. They piss me off like nobody's business, but they're my little homies and I'd go crazy without them. <EM>Reunited and it feels so goooood?</EM> Not so much...but cool none the less.</P>

"event","There's nothin that picks a spirit up after the exam blues like the weekend. Friday night? Poker at Chaz's. Saturday night? Poker at Charleys. Sunday night..bonfire at Charley's, followed by coffee at Java.

Friday after my game, Wallace came and got me with Spence and Amanda, and we rocked out in the Escort to Vanessa Carlton. I have to say kids, I've never heard such a melodic version of ""MAKIN MY WAY DOWN TOWN, WALKING FAST, FACES PASS AND IM HOME BOUND"" then when Wallace parked his car and the four of us crooned. Well done, sirs. Then I went and played poker. Did I mention it's low ball or no ball? 

Saturday, Trina and I went to go see Great Bridge Theater Company be sweet at districts, and I have to admit that no one can play a rediculously paranoid whack job like my own Sean Ordway. Not to mention his hair was enough to stop a speeding bullet, and on that I applaud you, emoboy. Jackie, you're talking hand puppets were EXTRAVAGANT, and Charley Mann is quite a convincing nutcase as well. Congrats to all for getting first place; the show was fabulous. Then we all headed over to Charley's, watched Shawn of the Dead, listened to Chris's lecture on how to avoid zombie attacks and things of that nature, witnessed Sean and Charley compete in zombie noise-age, then topped it all off with some poker. Props to Joe Mann for beating Chaz somethin terrible.
And props to me for coming out 75 cents more than what I went in with.

Sunday I made $120 at work because it was mad busy. When I get home, Ordway called me and was like ""What's up Holly, down for a bonfire at Charley's?"" Heck yes, I was! But it turns out bonfire is Mann code for ""fire in small trashcan."" That was kinda disappointing, but it was interesting none the less. 

Charley Mann's code of fire safety:
None.

Then after being harrassed with flaming sticks, we all headed over to Java Junction for a hardcore game of JENGA. I don't know if Jenga can really have a set winner, but I sure as hell know I wasn't the loser- and that's really all that matters.

Because your eyebrows never keep growing, says he.&nbsp;You don't see people combing back their eyebrows when they've gone too long without a trim, do you? Eyebrows are a miracle of life that always stay the same length, therefore they cannot&nbsp;replenish themselves&nbsp;once shaved. Okay, so Kelbo's an idiot...but he serves a good point.

<P>It breaks thumbs, which makes you have to sit out 2 games, and I'm not much for cheering. Also suddenly turns you into the unofficial water girl. Oh, injury reserve list, you torture me!</P>
<P><STRONG>New found reasons why I admire Sean Ordway:</STRONG></P>
<P>He doesn't call me a retard when I throw tantrums during&nbsp;poker games.</P>
<P>He can change a flat.&nbsp;</P>
<P>This weekend I spent in Norfolk once again, and it seems like everytime I leave there I have more and more to think about. Charlie's Cafe is the greatest job ever. Kathy&nbsp;Lawless is the greatest stepmom ever,&nbsp;Norfolk is the best city ever, and&nbsp;Granby Street&nbsp;was made for me.&nbsp;Maybe I'm exaggerating a little, and I hate to sound like another whiney Great Bridge brat, (example: ""Great Bridge is the gayest place on Earth, blahblahblahhhh"") but it sure beats Chesapeake. Sean came out to see me, and my dad told him that he would promptly&nbsp;whoop his ass if necessary. We went to Relative Theory with Charley, grabbed some coffee and then hung out at mi padre's and watched the Duke game.</P>
<P>Topped off the weekend by playing poker at Chaz's and beating him with his own money. Which reminds me- what's up Patriots? Way to win me 2 bucks from Ordway today.</P>
<P>Kathy told me that I'm going to DC with her March 11th to see the ACC tournament, which makes basketball suck not as hard. It's going to be sweet, since ACC is OWNING this year, and I get to check out all the crazy sites in DC. What's up Smithsonian? What's up Museum of Modern Art? Yea, I'm a big fat dork, but it'll be fun either way.</P>

I'm sick of fighting for you, and I'm sure as hell sick of not getting my two cents in. So here goes, killa:

Just because you're a spineless coward does not mean I deserve to be punished. Yea, I fucked up, but wake up and realize that that was a year ago, and maybe you'll grow balls again. I gave up more for you than I've ever given up for anyone or anything in my entire life, and you've pretty much broken that up into a million pieces, and then proceeded to piss on it. Repeatedly. Thanks. 

You've also pretty much proved me wrong to all of God and creation when I defended you, saying that you could only have a good heart filled with good intentions. Thanks for using me like you always planned, and thanks for proving all those guys right who said you were nothing but a creep who would build me up and then break my heart all over and over again. Mission completed. Put one more notch on your bed post for me.

So in all this soul searching I've been doing, all this building and rebuilding, here's another thing brought to my attention tonight. Pastor Steve gets up, and he starts talkin about this kook in the Bible named Amnan, or Amner, or Amananana...iono, Steve was kinda losing focus. Anyways, this kid Amnan falls in love with his sister. Long story short, Amney rapes his sister and ruins her life. Tough story, I know, but my realization wasn't about how nutty this Amner guy was. It was somethin that's been in the back of my mind for I can't even tell you how long, but I never could get it clear enough to put it into words. It was something Pastor Steve said blatantly that really brought things into perspective for me: sin affects others. It really made me think...all those times when I was running wild...I hurt people who loved me very much, and now I'm left with the consequences of all that. Worst of all, I may have scarred someone very beautiful, who would have done anything for me. I can't live with myself knowing that I hurt someone's ability to love wholely and without reserve. Just another night where I keep wishing I could take all those things back, and wishing all this had some to my mind a lot sooner. But damn am I glad I see it now.

Now I just want to let go, and pray that someone makes him very, very happy. Someone that's not me."

<P>ahhhhhhhhh. </P>
<P>Lately my life has really been coming together. After the whole anti-drug/alcohol movement, things have really been coming into perspective for me, even if no one else believes in me. (Besides Justin and Crabb, as always.) Of course, nothing this good lasts forever, and my excellent vibes came crashing down on me when I got horrible news today. I feel like crawling into my sheets and never coming out again. So today I'm sitting at Sean's and my dad calls my cell. He says my grandmother's dying, and that ""everyone agrees that she wouldn't want to live hooked up to a machine much longer"". It's killing me, and I hate seeing Kathy and my dad trying so rediculously hard to be strong for me. I talked to Kathy on the phone, and being the amazing person she is, she tried her hardest to be light about it. But it's not light, and I could tell by her tone. Everyone's heart is breaking and I hate it. Not to mention my dad, the emo boy at heart. I never wanted to hear this kind of news in front of Sean...or anyone. I'm not much for crying. </P>
<P>And then I find out I'm not ""entertaing"". Cool? </P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG>So what else is there to do to blow off some steam but head out with the kids</STRONG></FONT> and drive by *certain houses* screaming obscenities out the window? Nothing, I say. Killed time as always with Justin, Kalyn, Joe, Keith, *Kristy, Ashley* (two very very glorious girls, whom I adore), Jon and the beautiful Cassidy. It helped for a while, as good friends, cars, air and cigarrettes often do, but now that I'm at home with no distraction from everything that's going on, I'm just falling back into this sad mode again. But hey, no one could ever say that Holly Lowe isn't a soldier, and just like always this will pass and I'll end up going back to the same bouncy girl I was a few hours ago. Some time.</P>

<P><FONT color=#ff6600 size=1>I was scared to give it to him myself at first, because I didn't think I could handle handing it over to him and seeing just how much he <STRONG>didn't </STRONG>care.

<P><FONT color=#ff6600 size=1>So Darran, being the mature and understanding person he is, took the pictures out, <EM>cut my face&nbsp;out of all of them</EM>, then <STRONG>threw my stuffed animals away</STRONG>. I sat there and watched him trash all our memories, everything that use to mean the world to me, just like I knew he would. He might want to sit and hate me for the rest of his life and waist his time being angry, but I'd rather look back on us and how happy we were. Because at one point, we <EM>were</EM> happy. I guess I should have been better prepared for all this, but I think I handled it pretty well, concidering I'm crazy and everything. I wish I could go back and change whatever I did in the last week that would make him sooo angry at me, but he won't tell me what it is and won't even look at me, so screw it. Life goes on... I'll find someone else...<EM>I hope</EM>. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Uuugggh. It's only Monday and I feel like this week has been going on forever.

<P><FONT color=#ff0000>So now here I am</FONT>, the most difficult part of the day.

He told the wonderful David Sachrison to give me back the stuff I had given him when we dated, so of course,<EM> two can play that game</EM>. I just finished arranging the inevitable ""break-up bag"", which consists of the following:</P>
<P>~ a watch he gave me (that he probably stole from his mama)<BR>~ a note he wrote me when we first broke up in the 8th grade<BR>~ every single picture I have with even his elbow in it<BR>~ the large stuffed dog that he <STRONG><EM>said</EM> </STRONG>he won me at Bush Gardens, which he actually just stole from Edmund Fitch and gave to me<BR>~ the much smaller stuffed hippopau...hippa......<STRONG>hippo </STRONG>that he really did win me at Bush Gardens, but wasn't half as exciting as the one he stole.</P>
<P>I don't think it's fair that I should have to give all this stuff back, concidering he'll probably just throw it away as soon as he gets it anyways. I, on the other hand, really do care about all these stupid things, (even if it's not much), because I really do care about him. I took one last look at all the pictures, just so that if he really did end up throwing them in the also inevitable ""break-up bonfire"", I could at least remember them for a little while. This is gonna be a lot easier for him than it is for me. </P>
<P>Note to self: never dwell over pictures where he looks pretty, and you look happy.</P>
<P>However,&nbsp; <STRONG>DO</STRONG> dwell over the ones where <EM>you </EM>look sexy and <EM>he </EM>looks like an ass.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ha so that whole thing about plans for this weekend~ we'll ignore that. Couldn't stay at Bergin's of course, because she was grounded. So me, Brittney, Austin and Flores hung out. Went to Tropical Smoothie again, then to Darran's for like 2 seconds, then to Chris's, then Austin's mom made us haul ass to my house...cuz she just went psyco or something. But to make up for it she wrote us a check to order some pizza. Word.</P>
<P>Me and Chris started playing quarters, but Austin wouldn't play cuz he's a little girl. Austin you suck at life.</P>
<P>Today I got grounded cuz Austin kept throwing Ritz Bitz around my house last night and forgot to clean them up, and I forgot cuz I was....well, drunk, so my mom knew they were all in here.&nbsp;Oops. I've officially come to the conclusion that alcohol sucks.</P>

<P>I'm currently on the phone with Brittney Volansky. She is drunk as a skunk and I am very disappointed in Donnie for letting her get so tipsy. But Lord this child is funny. Good gracious.

<P><FONT color=#ff6600>&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing I regret is all the fighting this week between me and a certain person who means a lot to me, even though I'm a bitch to them. I wish things could get normal between us and they would just forgive me for whatever I've done to make shit harder. I'll always care about you, no matter how much you fuck up or or what crazy shit we do. Just remember I knew you better than anyone else, and I was always there for you. I want things to be okay again, if that's okay with you, Mr. ""Anonymous"". </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6600>&nbsp; On a lighter note, I began my summer tan today at the beach with my good pal Flores. I ended up gettin real bad sun burn on my butt...sitting down has become&nbsp;kind of an obstacle. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6600>&nbsp; I missed my buddy Taylor while he was gone ALL break~ you missed a ton kid...it's gonna take me ages to fill you back in, and you know you'll be askin me like 50 million questions. But hey, all that matters is that we all wanted u to come back and goof around with us cuz it wasn't the same without you. </FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp; <FONT color=#ff0000>In a nutshell, this Spring Break has had ups and downs...mostly ups...and I'll never forget Heather yelling through out her house at me and Darran ""MY BOOBS ARE TINGLING!"", or how Heather's mom had thought we were smoking pot cuz we had so much body spray on. I'll never&nbsp;forget everyone trying to pretend we weren't home when&nbsp;Dolly Parton knocked on Heather's door to tell us how her 200 pound German Shepard could mess us up if we cut through her yard again. Then the walk to the YMCA was an adventure all in its own....&nbsp;Oh, and how me and Brittney went on a joke rampage on Chris and Darran, and how they just couldn't handle how much fun we were making of them. Wow...summer will be nuts...</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><EM>&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#000099> Darran came over this morning and then a little after that Brittney showed up.

I didn't have any pockets, so I told Darran to hold onto my wallet, which had my house key attached to it. BAD IDEA. Then Crabb ditched us to get high with some really f-ing COOL kids, and me and Midkiff went to see The Whole 10 Yards. Sorry Bruce, but you did way better in The Whole 9 Yards.

<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ff9900>&nbsp;&nbsp; After that I realized Darran still had my house key and whatnot so me and Midkiff got dropped off at Brittney's to wait for DW and Chris to show up with it.

Then when I got home he called me but his mom picked up the phone and kept askin me who I was so I just kept sayin I was Sara. Shit. I just hung up on her, so he's prolly get bitched at right now.

"event","<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>aaaahhhh so the past two days have been superb. It's been quite an adventurous Spring Break so far.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>&nbsp; So yesterday me Bri Bryan and Midkiff chilled at Heather's. We played like 20 rounds of Mario Kart, and Midkiff is officially knighted </FONT><FONT color=#3333ff size=5>Nintendo Geek of the <FONT color=#33ff33>World. </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000 size=3>Then those two jokers left and me, Bri and Heather told Darran to meet us at Walgreens, and I had to sneak out to go meet him. By myself. In the dark. So here I am walking around this neighborhood I've never seen before in my life, and my dumb tail gets lost as all get up. So I see this car driving by me, and I decide to hitch a little ride back to Heather's street. So we never got a hold of Darran and the poor kid rode around Great Bridge all night. Sorry babe.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>&nbsp;Then this morning we're all woken up with a phone call from a payphone...from who else but D Willie. And since Darran is cheap as all get up, it was a collect call. It was 9:30 in the morning and the kid was at Taylor's Do It Center riding around until he had to go to track practice. So we kept calling the pay phone back since we had the number on caller ID...it was kinda sweet.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffcc00>&nbsp;So the 3 of us go up and run A LOT at the track~(well, me and Heather did. Bri's a slacker. So's Darran. ""OH MR NEITER I HAVE A DISEASE IN MY KNEE I CANT RUN!"" yeeeeaaa whateva.) Then we started walkin back to Heather's and saw Midkiff driving to practice 30 min. after practice had ended, so we just picked him up and he tagged along. We got to Heathers and told good old Mexican to come over, and we all started drinking. Heather's a champ, but Darran's a lightweight. You drink like a girl brother. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>So after all this mess, Heather's dad shows up and we try to get all their tipsy tails out before he sees them. Darran left his shoes and his track bag, and it was pouring outside. For some reason, Heather's dad kept tryin to have little conversations with me. I was like <EM>man kid now is not the time brotha.</EM> So we tell her dad we're goin to the Y and meet all them boys down the road. Bri, Midkiff and Chris had bikes so they hauled tail and left me Darran and Heather behind. We were freezing and in our bathingsuits in a friggin hurricane, and I swear to God it was the longest walk in my life. But God was it great. I tried to jump and clear a big mud puddle, but just ended up sliding on my butt and getting my WHITE UNC shorts all funky. So Darran reached in his nice little track bag and threw me a pair of big boy pants, and I just decided to change my shorts right there in the middle of the soccer field off Battlefield Blvd. All these little kids playing soccer kept staring at me, but not to worry- I had my bathing suit on.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>All in all today was a success and I spent it with the grandest people I know. The only thing that was missing was my good old Catherine Bergin, but don't worry Hawaiian. We'll have our fun before the week is over. You know how we do.</FONT></P>

Went over to the tennis court with Darran, Kelbo (<FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>BFF</FONT>), Bri, Flores and Midkiff.

 Me and Stephanie Gaskins are sittin in the bleechers in Newport feeling very out of place yet again, watchin a game of bball when all of a sudden they was a full out brawl between two girls who were playin against eachother. It was BEAUTIFUL. A bunch of big black women ran onto the court, and one of them grabbed one of the girls by the jersey, but the girl was fightin so hard to get to the other girl that the lady feel right smack on her face and was dragged on the ground. They had to have like 5 guys grab this chick and throw her tail out of the gym. Me and Gaskins just sat there and watched this and felt wonderful about our day, even if we suck and our games were two hours behind and we had to play McCray's AAU team. It was still worth it. I mean damn..that crap doesnt happen in Great Bridge."

"event","<P>&nbsp;Today has been a&nbsp;pretty good&nbsp;day. Started off with a nice little salad today in teenliving, although I'm terrified of knives and refused to be anywhere near anyone who was cutting tomatoes. Kicked&nbsp;James out of the cooking group, cuz it turns out that everything James touches turns to crap. Sorry kid, but you're a walking disaster. Then I finished off my ASD at the beginning of lunch, hauled ass out of there and sat with Kelvin and Darran for a little while. McCray made a bunch of us stand up when he announced everything we placed in for the meet on Wednesday. Who would have thought that I had placed in long jump? </P>
<P>But anyways, went through a pretty slack day of track. Me, Bri, Kelly, Brooke, Heather and some other kids walked a battlefield&nbsp;and&nbsp;cut across the stadium after failing countless times at getting a ride around the block from strangers. Once we got back to the school and sat around doing nothing (becuz McCray doesn't believe in practice...shake that one off) me and Kelbo started wrestling and the kid elbowed me in the face and gave me another black eye. Thanks Turtle. </P>
<P>To finish that off, turns out that I'm going out with DW now. Who'da figured?&nbsp; Ha you know I luv you kid you're amazing.</P>
<P>After that, headed over to my basketball practice, where me, Gaskins and Christina dominated in an all guard, all white team that we like to call ""The Crackers"". Raise up.</P>
<P>Another tournament this weekend. Damn.</P>

"event","<P>So I didn't do too shabby at the meet yesterday. I earned the nickname Uh-Oh Oreo, becuz I'm officially the fastest white girl Brooke Lathon and my good good buddy Bri have ever seen. Too bad I'm the worst long jumper that ever lived...and Darran didn't get to go becuz his mom's crazy, and it made me sad. We all missed him. It wasn't as much fun. But hey at least white folks like me and Austin got to represent. </P>
<P>As predicted, Crabb pulled out first place in shot put. That's my girl. She's a beast, what can I say. Best pal right there. </P>
<P>I didn't get to make it to church with Crabb and Kyndall, so we missed Pastor Steve shave his head into a mohawk. God, I miss EVERYTHING. </P>
<P>As for today, I missed mad running at track cuz I was at ASD. (SWEET?) But it turns out, you're suppose to finish all four assignments they give you in ASD. The third assignment was to write an apology letter to all the teachers who gave you demerits, and well, Holly don't play that, so I was pretty slack and took the whole time just copying the rules and crap in the first two assignments. Then Mrs. Rogers forgot I was even in there and I stayed longer than I was suppose to. And now since I didn't finish all the assignments, I have to go into her room tomorrow during lunch and finish. (COOL?)Then I lost my track shoes cuz when my stepdad dropped them off at school Kalyn took them and failed to inform me they were in her locker. (GOOD LOOKING OUT CRABB) </P>

<P>&nbsp; This weekend was torture. The tournament was a joke, we lost 4 games in a row, and we were the only white team there. Again. Every other team had <EM>one </EM>token white girl who rode the bench until her team was beating us by at least 20. And that happened 3 out of 4 times. It was like Christmas for token white girls.We're not even that bad....Honestly. </P>
<P>&nbsp; So Wednesday we've got our first regular season track meet at Deep Creek. Be there. I expect my Crabb to dominate the shot area, and hopeful I'll represent the white folks again in the running area like the meet at GB, unless McCray takes me out of the 200 for skipping practice today.

<TD align=middle>You're chocolate. You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life. Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy. Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them. You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly. It is alright to open up every once in a while</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<P>You're Element is Flame. You have a strong, independant, fiery personality and you obviously don't ley other's puch you around. You like being in charge and don't care what other people think. In fact, you like to stand out and be yourself. You're probably shy when people first meet you but your a ball of energy that could explode at any given moment. You like to laugh and whether you admit it or not, you like to fight. You're peronality that is wild and untamable. You're beauty is physically fit and a little sexy and you have a very pretty face. </P>

"event","So today I have another basketball tournament and I'm just killin time before I have to head out to Hampton Highschool to ball up the avenues with Gaskins and the Greek. After practice, I spent all of last night watching Sex and the City..and oh how I miss that show. 
:(
  I'm sad because my good pal Bahen is out of town and I miss him terribly. Joe come hooommee!!!
  I'm also sad because I've decided I'm sick of relationships and stupid boys....they always screw you over and make u think they care but OH NO they are mistaken..... Sounds kinda bitter, huh? Oh well, Holly's a soldier. 

I'll probably be back in the game in about a day or two, because that's how I roll.
  

Kelvin Demps I love you pal keep your head up. We'll hang out soon I promise."

"event","So today I woke up mad late and me and my sister chilled around the house until my mom kicked us out. It was nice.
But when I got home from track practice I was home alone, I heard someone rattling the doorknob and I thought it was my parents so i just sat here but like a minute later no one had come in and the rattling kept going so someone was messin with the door. I was like ""well someones trying to break in- SWEET?"" Then I thought maybe I was just crazy or something and I went to sat down, and then I saw someone hauling ass across the window. But then all the rattling and whatnot stopped, so maybe Cola Jean (aka THE ENFORCER) scared them away. (my dog)But yea that was my excitement for the day, besides being super rejected by DW at the water fountain today..haha OUCH


you know whats funny...
i just noticed my dog ironically has the same middle name as miss rebekah curling..ha sweeeeeet"

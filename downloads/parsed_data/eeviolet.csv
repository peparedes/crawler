lots of good things happen amongst annoyances at work and with family. i'm back in south jersey tonight and things are better. i won't be at the office tomorrow and this makes me smile. i miss my girl, but i know the next two days will fly. friday = my cousin damon's wedding. saturday = whatever/time with the fam. 

my writing is a little stalled, but i'm getting some stuff down which is good. i'm concentrating on form and structure, particularly the value of repetition/some kind of refrain. it's something i worked on a while back and it's cool to return to it. 

i went to see an awesome show (technically rock opera) that trisha is stage managing. it's called ""greendale,"" after the neil young concept album. it's pretty rad. it may not be ""tommy,"" but it makes me want to buy the album (despite me hating neil young's voice). 

next weekend abby and lex move to JC, literally down the street, and it's almost enough to make me stay...but new york, man, it's been calling me for years. i got to go. and i love it too much not to. helene and i will be seeing a few places shortly. good prospects. i have faith.

some ridiculous crap has also been occurring, not so much to me, but to those i love. can we just be done with this cursed month already? (i have a theory that sometime between july-august is historically chock full of bad events. either that or it's a huge freaking coincidence.) these days, i'm feeling pretty strong and capable that i can manage just fine...but sometimes even the new & improved me gets down...

and then i remember the blue october concert in texas or random good times with my roommate or pride or eating indian on a thursday afternoon or cross-country or state phone calls with friends or writing on late nights in the subway or waking up with her -- and i smile. i'm happy. i'm on the right track..."

This is public because I actually believe that this little post will provide some kind of solace to the masses. At least those masses in their post-collegiate early 20s. 

See, the last few weeks I've been feeling like a massive failure. I'm not in grad school, I haven't been published, I like my job but I don't <i>love</i> it, I'm worried about my creativity being drained away, I'm poor, I'm a big ball of confusion, worry, spazing, and generally tortured by my own hand. Sometimes my inner monologue isn't pretty. 

But slowly, ever so slowly (after a minor meltdown), I started coming in contact with friends I had recently lost touch with and found out about <i>their</i> lives. And the generally consensus? 

None of us know what the hell we're doing.
We're all struggling, we're all worried, we're definitely all poor, and we're constantly fighting our inner demons to get to the next best thing. 

Sometimes we fake our happiness for everyone around us because we believe our friend next to us has it so much better. <I>They've really got their shit together.</i> 

But they don't.

And that is comforting.

"event","Hi,
I haven't been public lately. Still working, still saving, still interviewing. Other aspects of life have been subject to change, but that's not why I'm out here today.

I just went and read some old entries, mostly circa 2003. The one post that really got to me was the ""letters to many johns."" The way I perceived my friends, people I loved is still very much the same and yet so radically different I wonder who they are (& who <i>I</i> am). 

And there are a few who have dropped off the radar for various reasons and I still miss them. I think I miss who they were <i>then</i>, not so much them as people overall. Or maybe, as I said before, the way I perceived them. 

There are these times that I could just live in forever:
Running across streets, sitting in restaurants, flying to other countries, getting lost, driving at all hours of the night, drinking one too many glasses of wine, holding hands in the winter, swimming in the summer, everything.

I am lucky enough to say I had about three different families during the last few years. I had the Acorn family which has evolved but the ones I love the most are still here. I had the eclectic gay/lesbian family that started my freshman year and radically altered but no one else could have gotten me through some of those times. And finally, I had the family I created at the end of the world - senior year. (Yes, that was a deliberate homage to A HOME AT THE END OF THE WORLD.) The most unexpected people from the most unexpected places. 

Even with my losses, I've still come out smiling. Somehow...

"event","(a small tribute to IGBY GOES DOWN)

but i don't mean that in the scary/sarcastic way igby delivers it because i'm not really feeling that sarcastic or scary...

now that that's out of the way i have some news.

i am definitely not going to SF. as much as this crushed me (at first), i am realising that is a good decision - both logistically and emotionally. i came to understand some things about myself the last few days...

1. that i was pursuing the MFA in part because i thought the degree would validate me as a writer. this is bullshit. no amount of degrees can issue a person talent, drive, or as dear professor kim (one of my writing profs at drew) would say, SOUL. you can only be taught craft. and while i would like some more education in that area, i know enough at this point to carry my own weight. i have some credibility without an advanced degree.

2. therefore, i should concentrate on WRITING. i'm compiling lists of literary journals/mags, famous/not famous to start seriously submitting. most of the deadlines are in the fall as the summer is a dead zone for them. this gives me time to tinker around with my best stuff and maybe it will end up somewhere worthwhile.

3. as far as continuing my education goes, i had to face up to the fact that in my field you earn what you deserve. quite frankly, most people do not obtain a MFA in creative writing directly from undergrad. again, professor kim (dear wise woman - i should really thank you) stressed that to me during my whole application process. she herself waited four years in between college and grad school. and you know where she went? IOWA! one of the best schools in the country for creative writing if not THE best. she had experience in the field, was writing, etc. so this is what i want to cultivate. i want to be able to apply somewhere more reputable than new college and send them copies of poems/etc. published in good journals. 

4. which leads me to money...having more experience and growth behind me will enable me to find things like fellowships and more grants. ah ha. free money. comes at a price: time. and that is something i can live with...

5. and finally, you either are a writer or you are not. there is no defined moment of validation or recognition. i could win ten awards in my lifetime and probably still feel inadequate in some way. SO...i'm going to stop thinking negatively and keep writing. i know i can do this.

my current plans go something like this...i've been applying to jobs in philly and new york. today i put up two posts on craigslist (one for each city) for rooms/roommates wanted. i already got two responses from nyc. i am going to try life without academia for a while. in essence, to quote one of my other favorite movies, BETTER THAN CHOCOLATE: ""i thought i'd try learning about life...from life.""

JANE, ""goodbye."" mostly the last one led into listening to the others/random pretenders songs. i love chrissy hynde's (spelling?) voice. between her, tricky, and maxi jazz, i could have a field day using a voice other than mine. 

so, anyway the point of this post was that i am in a constant state of transportation. i suppose that's natural after graduating. i am taken back to such specific memories by the triggers of two notes of music or the taste of some food. 

earlier today i listened to phil's infamous ""no sex in the tent room"" and dj sammy's version of ""heaven"" came on...whoa dog. all the way back to my first club. that's a loaded memory right there. i wrote five drafts of a poem inspired by that recollection in my car this morning. still so effing inspired by that time. and i don't mind anymore...the least i could get out of it, right? well, that and hell of a lot more. 

the sight of sashimi at the party made me think of the first time i tried sushi and it was in a combination tray and i swallowed the whole tuna piece at once and i said it looked like raw cow meat. but there was so much light around that time...even in february.

or the sight of fanta in a grocery store makes me return to the sandwich shop near school in london because that's all i drank there. aside from the copious amounts of alcohol.
(speaking of which, i keep thinking i need to go back...more seriously than ever.)

more obvious than a song or a meal is the insane amount of AIM conversations and emails i have saved over the years. i was so paranoid about my drew account shutting down i went through all my messages and sent them to my hotmail and/or gmail accounts to make sure i had what i wanted to remember. it blew me away to realise what i've been - what i'm <i>still</i> - saving."

"event","so something good for a change.
because, well, something good - dammit!

i went to philly with kate this weekend which turned out to be great fun even though we ended up melting into little pools on south street.

the purchases:
- a fabulous pin that reads: ""FUCK OFF: this message brought to by the 1st amendment."" rock on.
- cool birthday cards
- a corona at a shady mcshadster bar (i don't even know the name of it - for all those familiar with the area it's the one with the giant mural painted all over the building - very bright. i think it's just after or before the TLA...)
- really good italian ice from IRISH ICE. wtf, mate?
- and of course, taco bell. why do i always end up there?

and we ran into some guy from drew - i believe he is known as fridge, he lived on my floor or hoyt 2nd (i can't bloody keep track anymore) - in DQ because i desperately had to piss. it was amusing.

of course, no day would be complete without slighty weird guys hitting on you in a bar, right? oh dear lord...

the rest of the weekend basically consisted of me lounging in the air-conditioning and brooding. but there was an exciting interlude at the flea market on sunday. i am wearing a cool new hippie skirt (made in india of course with that awesome firey smell - what is that? i love it) and earrings. crazy big earrings. i bought 2 pairs, actually. i think i am turning into a gypsy. i told my dad it was just me returning to my flower child days...as if i was actually alive between the years 1966 and 1973 (roughly). 

at any rate, it wasn't a total bust and now i have fun new things to wear.
and! i started birthday shopping for some of my favorite soon-to-be 21 year olds. :) 

(i am so one of those people who has trouble keeping birthday gifts a secret...egads.)

anyway, i got less than 15 minutes before freedom so i'm off - 
not quite like a prom dress...

"event","i decided today that i am like watching baz lurhman's <i>romeo + juliet</i>. 

i originally wrote ""my life"" but that's not accurate. that's just what i perceive. i guess ""i am"" is what i perceive too...but it seems truer to what i'm feeling. 

bright colors. extremism at every turn. no expense spared. when someone smiles, it's as wide as the grand canyon. when someone cries, it resonates in a space ten times as large. 

<i>was ever book containing such vile matter/so fairly bound? o, that deceit should dwell/in such a gorgeous palace!</i>

i just had that line in my head and had to dig out my bevington anthology to make sure i was quoting it right. i had something like ""and i built this castle"" but then realized it was palace and juliet was referencing romeo killing tybalt, etc. etc. it's not entirely fitting, but then again, is a shakespearean play really the whole of my life?

words for thought.

came out of hermitting mode last night. went to kate's. met john. went to new hope with john, chris, and kate. drank. walked to jersey. (via the bridge over the delaware - of course.) walked back. hung out all night. caught up on the rest of the L word season. huge high five in the air. (i love shane even more...oh god, i need her to be a real person. jesus. she rocks my imaginary world.) saw the sun come up. first time since post-graduation. talked of the past. talked of the future. something healed. something wounded. had an adventure on 95 south. went past the airport and thought of december. made me think i'm not such a creep. made me think i'm better than that. finally made it back to jersey. saw the family and didn't kill anyone. 

also helped del pack on saturday. going back to jersey city tomorrow to move out. i helped move in, now she's leaving.

and then there's the <b>other room</b>: basically just setting up the tv and vcr/dvd and moving the desk. of course, i might also want to move the crates of books that couldn't fit on my shelf into some organized clump in the corner. if i bring my refigerator upstairs, i'll never have to leave the two rooms. lol.

but truthfully, <i>i really want to move</i>...

"event","maybe it's something about leaving, maybe it's something about a new beginning or a new computer or a new outlook on things or watching big on <i>sex & the city</i> have heart surgery and utter the line, ""life is too short.""  but something is changing...

today, the day after, was the day it hit me.

i feel like i'm leaving (maybe even <i>losing</i>) so much...i'm worried about going off to san francisco and forgetting. i'm afraid of going to new york and becoming a corporate whore. i'm worried i have too much baggage. i'm afraid it's going to negatively impact my future. my relationships. i'm afraid it already has. 

i am watching the last four years like i'm watching <i>sex & the city</i> and here's what i can conclude, out of all the cloudiness:

no one i met or interacted with is, was or will ever be a truly horrible or bad person. we <i>all</i> have issues. and as compassionate as i might have been, i wish i had been more. (perhaps to <b>different</b> people...) it's a lesson i hope to take from my experiences back there...i don't believe it was all in vain. i just can't. i haven't become that much of a cynic. 

<i>it's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you...</i>
-toto

if only i could access my computer's (as in my drew computer) music right now, i would be playing eve 6's ""here's to tonight."" i know, i know...inducing of tears. but the way i see it, bring it on now...besides it's 24 hours later. i'm not supposed to have the rest of my life figured out. (i have given myself <i>that</i> much leeway...is that how leeway is spelled, ps?) 

i think i can end this post by repeating something i said to my mom tonight:
""it wasn't like high school, you know...i kept a couple good friends, really one who significantly changed my life. the past few years have been huge. and even the people i wasn't that close to have severely impacted me. as matt galen said in his speech, <i>we grew up together.</i> we ate together, slept together (both ways - oh jesus), fell down, stood up, helped each other, ultimately. even the bad experiences i had were worth it to me. 

the only thing i wish i could take back would be all the shitty things i did to various people.
the only good byproduct of those times is that i realized the shitty things that other people did to me weren't so shitty...cuz it's all relative.

we're all kinda shitty sometimes.

but dammit, <i><big>we were there.</i></big>

and in the end, here & now, that is what i remember.

and it is what makes me so grateful,
also what is making me miss it all (everyone) like yes, blood in my arteries..."

you can all blame gerry smith-wright on that...
she said at the english majors' party that this is the only time in your life where you will be free to wander around and just <i>be</i>...

It's up to you
Now that you understand
To take those who don't by the hand

Cause you can see it coming
You can see it coming
You can see daylight vague beneath the stars

It's up to you
To keep the memory
To not lose the shape of the melody

Cause we don't sing the same song anymore
And now your offering is requiem
Cause we don't sing the same song anymore
And now your offering is silent requiem

It's up to you
To understand at your age
To not let the years charge a wage

It's up to you
To see it in the eyes
Of all those who've gone, to realize

If you can see it coming
You can see it coming
You can see them high, high upon the stars

It's up to you
Not to sing along
When all of the feeling is gone

Cause we don't sing the same song anymore
And now your offering is requiem
Cause we don't sing the same song anymore
And now your offering is silent requiem

And I can see that look on your face
When you don't sing along, you don't sing along

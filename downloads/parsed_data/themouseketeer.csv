How do you punctuate the following sentence?  (Now, I am not adding any punctuation, but you'll understand it anyway.)

Is it raining outside I wonder

Anyone know how to correctly punctuate that? I have had a number of ideas but none of them seem right.  Is there a question mark for the question - and if so, where?  This one stumped me."

Plus other librarians, historians and interested parties... so I am copying Whafford's post and pointing you all in the direction of something REALLY cool.  Go look. And, if you want to, sign up. But at least pass the word!

Originally posted by <lj user=""whafford"" /> at <a href=""http://whafford.livejournal.com/79255.html"">Ur Crowdsourcing IV</a><div class=""repost""><p>The UrCrowdsource site went live today. In two categories, letters and field notes, 349 documents are currently&nbsp;allocated to be transcribed, but more are on their way. I don&#39;t have metadata or relationships between documents associated yet, but am working slowly to put that together. I&#39;d hoped to allow the public to do that as well, but the way the system works, annotations like that are part of Omeka rather than part of Scripto so it would require extra logins that would only complicate matters. For now, the transcriptions will be a great addition and I hope that many people will participate. And the organization at the moment is in reverse order, i.e. latest document first followed by earlier. Filenames show association as well, so 1923-4-17a and 1923-4-17b are part of the same document, written in 1923.</p><p>There&#39;s a lot of really interesting material contained in these notes and letters. For an example of what is ahead, check out <a href=""http://www.penn.museum/blog/collection/archival-practice/archaeology-remembering-the-human-element/"">this Museum blog entry by one of my local volunteers</a>, the one who scanned many of the documents that are now available for transcription.</p><p>Meanwhile, I encourage you to go to <a href=""http://urcrowdsource.org/omeka/"">UrCrowdsource.org </a>and look through the documents. If you want to transcribe, you&#39;ll need a Scripto login which can be obtained by emailing me or by using the Sign Up link on the UrCrowdsource main page. I&#39;ve already&nbsp;sent emails and automated passwords to those who have given me their email addresses and I&#39;ve sent tweets to those who expressed interest but who did not send me their emails. I&#39;m afraid I sent too many tweets that essentially said the same thing--I lost followers because of that--but I do want those who are interested to know about the site.</p><p>If you have sent me your email&nbsp;but did not receive a password, check your spam filter. The password is sent through an automated mediawiki program that might get caught in such things.</p><p>There are a few steps to go through before you can transcribe, but I&#39;ve put instructions up on how to do it at each major step of the way; I hope they are clear. If there are problems, let me know and I&#39;ll try my best to fix them.</p><p>When you receive a password, it is a temporary one for the underlying mediawiki site. It must be changed in mediawiki to show that you are going to continue. After that, all work will be done on the Omeka site with that password entered into Scripto. Again, instructions should guide you through the steps.</p><p>Finally, there are transcription guidelines on the site to show what to do with undecipherable words, formatting, and special characters. You might want to keep a separate window open with that page up so you can refer to it quickly.</p><p>Thank you so much for helping to transcribe these old documents. It would take much longer without you.</p><p></p></div>"

I remember learning to talk. I knew the sounds that I wanted to make, but could NOT work out how to get my mouth to make those sounds.  It was a bit like trying to write using my feet!  I even remember watching someone's mouth very intensely and realising, ""So, THAT is how they make that 'T' sound. The tongue is THERE.""

This is why I KNOW that babies understand a lot more than many people think they do.

After that, I remember being in a particular house, listening to my parents talking and singing the unfamiliar words to myself.  Due to the layout of the house, and the fact of when we moved, I had to have been younger than 18 months old. Very vivid memories, I know what I was sitting on etc etc.

But learning to talk was VERY early."

Mississippi is voting on November 8th on whether to pass Amendment 26, the ""Personhood Amendment"". This amendment would grant fertilized eggs and fetuses personhood status.

Putting aside the contentious issue of abortion, this would effectively outlaw birth control and criminalize women who have miscarriages. This is not a good thing. 

<a href=""http://www.jacksonwomenshealth.com/"">Jackson Women's Health Organization</a> is the only place women can get abortions in the <i>entire</i> state, and they are trying to launch a grassroots movement against this amendment. This doesn't just apply to Mississippi, though, as Personhood USA, the group that introduced this amendment, is trying to introduce identical amendments in <i>all 50 states</i>.

What's more, in Mississippi, this amendment is expected to pass. It even has Mississippi Democrats, including the Attorney General, Jim Hood, backing it.

The reason I'm posting this here is because my friend made a meager donation to the Jackson Women's Health Organization this morning, and received a personal email back hours later - on a Sunday - thanking her and noting that she was one of the first ""outside"" people to contribute.

So if you sometimes pass on political action because you figure that enough other people will do something to make a difference, make an exception on this one. My RSS reader is near silent on this amendment. My friend only found out about it through a feminist blog; I only found out about it through her. The mainstream media is not reporting on it.

If there is ever a time to donate or send a letter in protest, this would be it.

What to do?

- Read up on it. <a href=""http://www.wakeupmississippi.org/"">Wake Up, Mississippi</a> is the home of the grassroots effort to fight this amendment. <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/07/1023558/-Occupy-My-Uterus-My-Ass!-Fertilized-Eggs-Are-NOT-People!"">Daily Kos</a> also has a thorough story on it.

- If you can afford it, you can donate at the site's link.

- You can <a href=""http://www.democrats.org/contact"">contact the Democratic National Committee</a> to see why more of our representatives aren't speaking out against this.

- Like <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/WakeUpMississippiorg/237684486281516"">this Facebook page</a> to help spread awareness.

You probably don't know Ellie, but she is definitely to blame.
 
She said how much fun she had, when she said ""YES"" to doing a random thing and how we should all take the opportunity to say YES more often. And to 'live life out loud.'  So while I was feeling all motivated and inspired, I saw our local hospice, that provides loving end of life and respite care, was doing a number of fundraising events.  So I signed up.
 
To abseil off the tallest Transporter Bridge in the world.
 
It sounded fun.  So I said YES. Then I looked at just. How. High. It. Freaking. Was.
 
Aaargh!!!  All I can think is ""it's going to be cold up there!""
 
So, please don't let me do this all on my own.  Go to my Just Giving page and donate, to help the St David's Foundation continue their amazing work, and to make me feel all warm and fuzzy and supported - when I am feeling very cold and definitely UNsupported on the end of a rope on 26th March.
 
What are you waiting for? Go here to see the bridge in all its glory...http://www.justgiving.com/Gillian-Clark-Anthony
 
Oh, and yes, please do pass this on and spread the word that I have finally gone loopy.


(So, yes, this answers the question, ""Is she still alive?"" I am. I am just swamped somewhat with work, toddlerdom, DIY, and trying to carve out a tiny part of life for myself - hence saying YES to this event.)"

Islamic art uses many geometical floral or vegetable designs in a repetitive pattern known as arabesque.  It is used to symbolize the transcendent, indivisible and infinite nature of Allah.</span></p>
<p>People that like Islamic art tend to be more traditional people that appreciate keeping patterns that they learned and experienced from their past.  It is not to say that they are not innovative personalities, they just do not like to let go of their roots.  They like to put new ideas into details and make certain that they will work before sharing them with others.  Failure is not something they like to think about because they are more interested in being successful and appreciated for their intelligence.  These people can also be or like elaborate things in their life as long as they are tasteful.  They tend to prefer geometric patterns and vibrant colors.</p>

Ten references you expect your nearest and dearest to get:

1. ""What to you want me to do?  Kill him again?""

2. ""Face it girls; I'm older and I have more insurance.""

3. ""May the forks be with you.""

4. ""To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.""

5. ""My own brother's a freakin' vampire.""

6. Admittedly he was listening to a Best of Queen tape, but no conclusions should be drawn from this because all tapes left in a car for more than about a fortnight metamorphose into Best of Queen albums. 

7. ""Also, I can kill you with my brain.""

8. ""I only came here to build a bridge.""

9. ""You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.""

10. There would be one long staircase just going up. And one even longer coming down. And one more leading nowhere just for show.


OK, so some *may* be a little more obscure; but how many can you get?"

"event","I have been instructed to tell what we already have so that *certain* people can get stuff and we don't end up with 6 changing tables and no nappies (in their words)  There is no tradition of baby showers in the UK and it all seems a bit mercenary, but as I *always* do what I'm told (quiet there in the back!)

And I'm also interested in what people think of the list.  It's been colllated from various sources and, as I have *NO* experience of babies, I'm not 100% sure which bits are *actually* necessary and which bits are just put their by the purveyors of baby goods!  Bear in mind that we have accumulated a lot of this stuff and not always actually had to PAY for it. Hence we have a couple of odd things that we wouldn't have thought actually essential - like a 'bath box.'

So, by category: <lj-cut>

NURSERY:

Have: 
Cot, 
cot mattress, 
crib, 
crib mattress, 
2 baby sleeping bags, 
1 wool blanket, 
1 fleecy blanket, 
1 room thermometer, 
bouncy chair
Promised: Sheets
Still on list: 
night light, 
monitor (including motion sensor mat) 
playmat, 
mobile

OUT AND ABOUT:

Have: 
Pushchair, 
raincover, 
car seat, 
car sunshade, 
baby carrier/sling, 
travel cot
Promised: Footmuff
Still on list: 
sun shade for pushchair, 
changing bag (any ideas on what to look for in one?)

BATHING AND CHANGING

Have: 
Changing mat, 
baby bath with stand, 
bath thermometer (given to us by the lady who passed on the bath to us, with the comment that it was about as much use as a chocolate fireguard but we might as well have it) 
changing table, 
bath box to hold all the bits

Still on list: 
Most of the bits! Soft washcloth or sponge, baby scissors, brush and comb, lidded bin or nappy unit, cotton wool, barrier cream, nappies (planning to trial some reusables, but will want disposables for the first few days at the very least) towel (really like and want at least one of those cute hooded baby towels that have ears on them. Preferably in yellow or orange to match the nursery) nappy bags, baby wipes/baby lotion

Don't want: baby toiletries! 'Top and tail bowl' (I mean, WHY?!)

Not sure we need: foam bath support

FEEDING:

Have: 
breast pads, 
bibs (loads, they seem to have arrived from all directions!) 
nipple cream, 
breast pump, 
nursing pillow, 
4 bottles
Promised: steriliser
Still on list: muslin squares, breast milk storage bags, bottle brush

CLOTHES:

Have: A few items for 0-3 months, more for 3-6 months, one for 6-9 months.  Mostly sleepsuits and body suits/vests. No 'proper' clothes.  Got a little hat, some socks, bootees and a couple of scratch mitts. Shawl to bring Junior home with - that Steve and his brother were both christened in :-)

Promised: hand knitted bits from Diane, who is thrilled we're expecting

Still on list: Cute clothes across the first year.  We have the very basics, passed on through Freecycle mostly, so Junior won't freeze but I have restrained myself from buying anything.  Not planning on getting anything smaller than 0-3months until Junior is born as anticipate they might not fit in them at ALL if a big baby.

Oh, and the nursery is painted yellow, with an orangy safari border. I asked Ma if she would get the bedding for the cot and crib.  I said that it would be lovely to have the bedding to match, but that I would leave it up to her.  So far we have a blue and pink blanket, a blue lighthouse sleeping bag, a brown gingham teddy bear sleeping bag and a cream fleece. Go figure!"

"event","As I put in the 'In Deepest Sympathy' card.

""Richard was a fine man and will be greatly missed by many people. During my time at Cranfield he was always encouraging and supportive. He was very perceptive and had a way of seeing what others missed and coming up with positive and helpful ideas, that I still put into practice today.

He had excellent business ideas and did a fantastic job as FMM director. My husband, an MD, always said he had 'the utmost respect' for Richard (high praise indeed) and enjoyed numerous long conversations with him.

Richard was also very kind and wanted to do the right thing by people. He sometimes had to make tough decisions and was always concerned about their impact on the people involved. In one instance I know well, the person involved is devasted by Richard's death - again demonstrating his ability inspire respect and loyalty even through difficult situations.

As I said, he was a very fine man and will be sorely missed. You are all in my thoughts and prayers.""

His funeral was on Friday.  At his request, Elvis was played.  Elvis has finally left the building.  Alan passed on a thought that *he'd* found a consolation - Richard his exercised his right to choose.  Alan said he was always encouraging people to do just that; and at least this was Richard's choice.

Hard for the people he'd left behind.  Apparently he missed his girlfriend just too much after she died last year.  Richard, I hope you have now found peace.

And to all my friends, make that call you have been putting off, write that letter. I am glad I spoke to Richard a few weeks ago and told him I was expecting. I just wish I'd followed the call up as I'd meant to. It may not have made any difference at all, but it is something I'd *meant* to do, and now I don't have the opportunity.  But I am SO glad I'd made that first call.  He was a very fine man."

<P>You are a normally quiet person with very strong convictions and a marked activist streak. You have a clearly defined sense of right and wrong, and you like seeing people punished for their transgressions. You are Nemesis, goddess of punishment. You are a champion for the defenseless, you love poetic justice and, if karmic retribution doesn't have its say, then you'll have yours. You are astute, rarely fooled, and idealistic. <BR><BR>Your defining characteristic is your internal and inflexible system of morals. Because of your highly intuitive nature, you possess the theoretical nature required to define those morals, but you sometimes lack the ability to verbalize and expound on them, especially on the more nuanced parts of your worldview. Regardless, you have strong instincts which often prove to be correct, and rather than preaching, you act on them. You don't compromise -- ever. <BR><BR>You can sometimes be a person of great internal stress. You don't have double standards, and so you expect the same of yourself as you expect of others. You might find, sometimes, that you have just as hard of a time in living up to those expectations as the people around you. As a result, you are rarely at peace with yourself, but you're also likely to think of this in a positive light -- you're always forcing yourself to improve, and you avoid making mistakes. <BR><BR>You tend to be a private person, and don't like to talk much about those staunch morals of yours until, that is, they become violated. Once that happens, everyone is going to know exactly where you stand. You have a distaste of nihilism and intellectual relativism that will make you naturally compatible with scientists and certain kinds of philosophers, even if they don't share your activist streak. <BR><BR>Famous People like you: Goethe, Voltaire, Susan B. Anthony, Robert Burns<BR>Similar Personality Types: Prometheus, The Oracle, Hermes, Orpheus<BR>Avoid: Icarus, Dionysus, Agamemnon, Atlas<BR>You may or may not be able to get along with an Odysseus -- it will depend on his/her upbringing. </P></DIV><table cellpadding=20><tr><td><!--t-->Link: <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=6185258618751578079'>The Greek Mythology Personality Test</a> written by <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/profile?u=Aleph_Nine'>Aleph_Nine</a> on <a  href='http://www.okcupid.com'>OkCupid Free Online Dating</a>, home of the <a href='http://www.okcupid.com/online.dating.persona.test'>The Dating Persona Test<!--/t--></a></td></tr></table>"

"event","OK, this is where I am looking to you all for your experiences and thoughts.  I have asked a few people and had slightly different views, so am interested in the overall concensus.

Basically, what, in your opinion, is the role of a Godparent?  Steve and I were talking about it and neither of us have had any involvement from our respective nominal godparents, so have no role model.

And yet, at the same time, there is the inherent feeling that some people we know would be 'good' as godparents, and others not.  So what is it that we are (perhaps subconsciously) channeling?  

We have a few thoughts, but I was just wondering what *you* all think.  Do you have godparents yourself?  Are you a godparent?  What is your experience/expectation?"

Steve and I often listen to the Radio 4 comedy half hours and this one had us laughing til we cried.  *BOTH* times we listened to it.  And Ma, too.

This is Mark Thomas's account of the terribly British way he was 'playing' with an *absurd* law requiring people to get advanced written permission before demonstrating in Parliament Square in London.  Let's just say that if you listen, you will understand the current rallying cry in our household of ""What do we when what?""  ""Trolls!""

""Comment and I'll give you a letter; then you have to list 10 things you love that begin with that letter. After, post this in your journal, and give out some letters of your own. Let me know if you want a letter.""

I replied, and was given the letter 'M' <lj-cut>

1. Making cakes.  Cakes are a luxury, so making them is a bit of timeless 'Me' time.  They have to be good solid cakes - muffins, or chocolate cake or banana bread or tea loaf; none of your cream gateaux for me.  And not *too* easy to make - I like having to beat the ingredients separately and combining them. Using my nice baking equipment.

2. Music. I don't listen to music the whole time, and enjoy peace and quiet when I work.  But there are some pieces of music that just make me relax and totally zone out.  Instantly.  And I don't necessarily know the pieces - I am usually so zoned out that all I can do is go '*THAT'S* the one,' and then miss the name of it.  Some are classical pieces, others are not but they all instantly make me relax.

3. Massage.  Another thing that makes me zone out.  Massage my shoulders to unknot me, and my head and feet to relax me.  Bliss.  Especially when done well.

4. Money.  I like having the security of savings. I like things being stable.  I also like being financially well enough off to be able to buy myself nice things without taking money from where we NEED it. And I like being able to buy things for my friends and loved ones.  (Although we are not quite there yet, I can see it happening soon.)

5. Motivating. I love motivating other people.  Seeing them get enthusiastic about something and wanting to take it further.  Seeing the light come on and their minds click into overdrive.

6. Minds.  I love learning how other people think.  Seeing things from another perspective. Learning from people I love who have a totally different way of looking at things.  Expanding my own mind, my own knowledge; and learning new things that can interlock with what I already know to open up a whle new world.

7. Making conversation with intelligent people.  Talking and listening and exchanging opinions and opening up new ideas between us. Creating something even more interesting and expansive than either of us ever thought of before.

8. My friends and my husband.  People I love and who love me.  The people who accept me, completely and unconditionally.  The people who will still bawl me out if I overstep the line, who will prod me and poke me and yet I am theirs and they are mine unequivocably.

9. Miaows.  Well, not in the middle of the night.  And not when I am on the phone. And not when I am tired, or ill, or stressed, or doing something else.  But I do at least love the *producers* of the miaows.

10. Magic.  The magic of the stillness of the world on Christmas Day, the magic of the stars at night, the magic of wonder and awe of things that just make you pause and go 'Wow' and sigh and relax and remember the world is a good place.  The magic of love and laughter and friendship and fun.  Magic."

"event","<lj-cut>1. Egg Nog or Hot Chocolate?
Hot Chocolate

2. Does Santa wrap presents or just sit them under the tree?
*Santa's* presents are wrapped and arrive in a stocking for opening at breakfast.  Presents from *other* people are wrapped and under the tree.

3. Coloured lights on a house, or white?
White.  Lots of white twinkling lights in the trees.  Unless I am gawping at someone *else's* display.

4. Do you hang mistletoe?
Not often. 

5. When do you put your decorations up?
1st December if I can.  It is usually later due to Real Life.

6. What is your favorite holiday dish (excluding dessert)?
Mushroom and cashew nut roast with mushroom sherry sauce.

7. Favorite Holiday memory as a child:
Not so much favourite but regular - mum with bronchitis hacking away in the corner.

8. When and how did you learn the truth about Santa?
What truth?  Santa still brings stockings (sometimes via other people, admittedly) so why rock the boat by asking questions?!

9. Do you open a gift on Christmas Eve?
If given one specifically to open then.

Yes, although not brilliantly.

13. Do you remember your favorite gift?

Peace.  Feeling like a domestic goddess and baking.  Decorating the tree. Sending out cards. Buying presents.  Watching people open presents.

15. What is your favorite Holiday Dessert?
Christmas pudding.

16. What is your favorite holiday tradition?
Putting the Christmas Angel up last.  Once everything else is up, she goes up to watch over us all.

17. What tops your tree?
A star thing, I think. Not got a special tree topper yet.

18. Which do you prefer giving or Receiving?
Giving.

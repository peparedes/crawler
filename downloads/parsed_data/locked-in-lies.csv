"event","umm....making this one public because i think it should be read by anyone who comes across my journal. 'tis a long poem though....however i like it alot.

-once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines he wrote a poem.he called it ""chops"" because that was the name of his dog.and thats what it was all about.and his teacher gave him an A and a gold star.and his mother hung it on the kitchen doorand read it to his aunts,that was the year that father tracey took all the kids to the zooand he let them sing on the bus.his little sister was born with tiny toenails and no hair.and his mother and sister kissed alot.and the girl around the corner sent him a valentine sighned with a row of x's, and he had to ask his fatherwhat the x's meant.and his father always tucked him in bed at night,and was always there to do it.
-once on a piece of white paper with blue lineshe wrote a poem.and he called it ""autumn"" because that was the name of the season.and thats what it was all about.and his teacher gave him an A and asked him to write more clearly. and his mother never huing it on the kitchen door, because of its new paint. and the kids told himthat father tracey smoked cigars and left butts on the pews and sometimes they would burn holes. This was the year his sister got glasses with thick lenses and black frames.and the girl around the corner laughed when he asked her to go see santa claus and the kids told him why. his mother and father kissed alot.and his father never tucked him in bed at night,and his father got mad when he cried for him to do it.
-Once on a piece of paper torn from his notebookhe wrote a poem.and he called it""innocence: a question"" because that was the question about his girl.and thats what it was all about.and his proffessor gave him an A and a strange steady look.and his mother never hung it on the kitchen door because he never showed her.That was the year that father tracey died and he forgot how the end of the apostles creed went.and he caught his sister making out on the back porch.and his mother and father never kissed...or even talked.and the girl around the corner wore too much makeup that made him caugh when he kissed her, but he kissed her anyway, because that was the thing to do.And at 3 a.m. he tucked himself into bed, his father snoring loudly.
-Thats why on the back of a brown paper bag he tried another poem.
He called it ""absolutely nothing"", because thats what it was really all about.
He gave himself an A, and a slash on each damned wrist, and he hung it on the bathroom door because this time he didnt think he could reach the kitchen.*

"event","ok..as opposed to the afforementioned update...i am not feeling so down today.
and do you know why ?!?!
i will tell you.
THE 7TH THATS WHY !!!!! its is when the him video collection is available in the states. woo!!
and another thing.
went into the library today...'cause i felt like sitting amungst books, and someone comes over and sits across from me at a table. so i think to myself ""hm...""
then-as i was minding my own buisness and reading my book,the dude starts to draw a picture. again i say to myself ""hm..."".
now about 15 minutes pass and i look up, and there on the piece of paper was a very rough sketch of what seemed to be me (and i know this because i know what i look like).
""strange "" i think to myself.
well...to make a long story short...he was drwaing me and as i was about to leave he stood up and gave the picture to me.* *a very nice thing for him to do indeed.


so yeah...tuesday, which is in 5 days..its going down. HIM. most definately."

Sleep with your head against the sky tonight.
I can't count how many times you have made me cry.
I marvel at the way your hair glows in the light."

"event","kinda like a cloud i was up way up in the sky 
and i was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe. sometimes i don't believe them myself and i decided i was never coming down.
just then a tiny little dot caught my eye it was just about too small to see 
but i watched it way too long and that dot was pulling me down 
i was up above it 
now i'm down in it 
i was up above it 
now i'm down in it 
well shut up so what what does it matter now 
i was swimming in the haze now i crawl on the ground 
and everything i never liked about you is kind of seeping into me 
try to laugh about it now,but isn't it funny how everything works out? ""i guess the jokes on me"" she said.
i was up above it 
now i'm down in it 
Iused to be so big and strong.I used to knowmy right from wrong. I used to never be afraid. I used to be somebody.
i used to have something inside 
now just this hole that's open wide 
i used to want it all 
i used to be somebody 
i'll cross my heart and hope to die but the needle's already in my eye.
and all the world's weight is on my back and i don't even know why.
what i used to think was me is just a fading memory 
i looked him right in the eye and said ""goodbye"" 
i was up above it 
now i'm down in it 
i was up above it."

They are beilived to be pure myth, but from every great myth there was a grain of truth."

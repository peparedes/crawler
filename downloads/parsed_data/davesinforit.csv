I walked around downtown after school today. I bought street meat and went into like, 5 million different coffee shops and bought coffee from each one. I got a Nutty Irishman from The Green Bean, it put me in the St. Patrick's Day spirit. Everyone was so green there. So I went to the Habernack and made myself a green bracelet. Then I came home. My mom bought this really nice smelling perfume so I've been following her around all day. I'm really in the mood to just watch movies. I wanna watch movies and cry and eat cookie dough. Ugh, I can be such a woman sometimes. Actually, now that I think about it, I'd probably be better off as a woman. LMAO, sex changes are like changing your navel. One day you're an outtie, next you're an innie. IT'S MY FIRST DAY AS A WOMAN AND IT'S ALREADY THAT TIME OF THE MONTH. Wait, do you get your ""monthly visitor"" (LMAO) when you're truly a man? Because this one time on CSI, heshe had to get fake blood and left like, tampons and pads covered in it laying around so hisher fiance would think that heshe was really a woman. OKAY, BUT THE MAD TRANNY DOCTOR WAS ACTUALLY A MAN AND WAS PERFORMING ILLEGAL SURGERIES IN THIS BASEMENT AND HESHE FOUND OUT AND TRIED TO TELL THE COPS BUT THE DOCTORS HUSBAND KILLED HIMHER. It was upsetting, actually. Was this body in the basement and his legs were spread and there was NOTHING. JUST A GIANT FUCKING HOLE COVERED IN BLOOD. And apparently the smell was bad. And then that movie's coming out soon, Transamerica? It seems society is accepting these kinda things now, or people just want to cause a controversy. I AM A CONTROVERSY, BITCH. My face smells like egg. Bad eggs at that. Or maybe it's just Sam. Oh of course, blame the dog. I want a pet rodent, though. I think it would be fun. LMAO NO WAIT, Spencer's enough of a rodent.
I'm gonna go practise piano now or go drink with my mom's friends or by myself or idk."

I have absolutely no freedom living with my dad. I can't stay out late, I can't go to people's houses, I have to call him every 20 minutes if I go to a show. I can't stand it. There's just something about us and we just can't seem to get along. I know I have half his genes but... yeah, I don't know. I don't know if it's because I went with my mom when they got divorced, but I swear that man doesn't like me.

I love Thanksgiving. Actually, that's a lie. I really don't see a point to it. I mean, you sit around a table and eat turkey that's been sitting in the basement freezer since last year and you get mashed potatoes on your dressy clothes and your grandpere tells stories about how his ear fell off. If you ask me, we should go old school. Like, loin cloths and top hats. And eat outside. With your hands. And then maybe it would be fun. Anyways, reality. Everyone just went around the table and said what they were thankful for (ugh, kindergarten all over again). No one said for all of us being together since no one actually wanted to be there all together. It was weird sitting at the table without Grandmere, so I sat at the little kids table. I somehow got into a whipped cream fight with my cousin and got it all in my hair. Nasty.ass.shit. AND JESUS CHRIST IT'S LIKE 2 DEGREES UP THERE. Celcius, of course. I can't tell American temperature. I wish I had a pet polar bear to keep me warm. Woah, actually it would be cool if everyone had a polar bear.

I hate the weekend. I'm not like the Weekenders and have like, a group of friends that go out and chill at the arcade. I sit at home and watch movies with my mom. WTF is up with that, dude? 

Anyways, in biology I found this spot on my head and if I touch it I get goosebumps. It's actually like, so cool and works everytime. That's all I learned in biology. Failed another math test. Never taking math again in my life, I swear.

I start work tonight! I can't believe you can this excited about working. I've got my clothes laid out and I've practised greeting customers in the mirror until Julie called me an anus and told me to shut up. I think my egg rolls are coming back up..."

School's been pretty cool. I mean, I totally dig biology now (that's the ugliest sentence ever) and spare I just follow cute boys around. I just look up the word 'eskimo' in english and act all pillow-sock-ical when the teacher asks me a question. We're doing some project for foods so I actually have to go out shopping for ingredients tonight. My goal: Make a whole meal out of bananas.

Then I came home and walked Sam and cleaned the house. Maman's coming home today and it has to look perfect. Julie and her fiancee always knock things over when they're together. GROSSEH. I'm so glad I finally get to eat *real* food, not week old chinese take out that gets all greasy when you try to warm it up and pizza with pockets of hot grease that burn your mouth when you bite into them and creamy, sticky kraft dinner.

I was cleaning out my computer and I found this. It was that one ugly morning I was hungover and throwing up and feeling all gross. I had to write out the directions to the next town and fell asleep in the backseat. Randomly woke up and took this.

I went and picked up Kirsten and we went to the drug store. We got hair dye and came back to my place and dyed our hair. Everytime I look in the mirror it's kinda like 'holy shit, why is my hair black?'

I talked to Spencer on the phone for a really long time while eating pancakes (with nothing on them because syrup ruins it). I broke my fucking ass by sitting on Sam's toy and all he can do is laugh. I'm supposed to be calling him like, now, but his phone's off. WTFEVER BOY.

Then after a bit Julie came home from work and I just kinda followed her around and kicked her ass like I used to. She sat on me for a while until I stopped complaining about getting my lip pierced. So we headed downtown. It's actually really cool, we've gotten so close since Maman left for her business trip. We sung Madonna the whole way in the car with the windows down. We got to the place and I was ready to turn home but she got really mad because she would have wasted her time and gas if she came all the way here and didn't see me cry so she dragged me in. Well, the piercing dude was like, super hot x a billion, so I focused the whole time on his thighs. I still can't really close my mouth properly and everytime I try to drink it just kinda slips out my mouth.

I ended up going to school since I had a biology test. I told my mom that it was just acne and that I hadn't washed my face in a while. She believed it and sent me off. I got to school and my teacher's like, ""Um, Dagh-vid, you do realize you have to stay home when you're sick, right?"". I told I thought it was acne and we actually argued for like, 5 minutes on whether or not I go home. She won. I went home, watched television, went through Julie's stuff, unpacked some shit and tried to make a potato pie (since we had the crust thing but nothing but potatoes).

I quit my job last night. I accidentally broke the ice cream machine and my boss pulled me to the back room. Holy shit, I was terrified. But before he got a word in I told him I quit and left. Anyone want a McDonald's uniform?

I'm thinking of dropping biology. I mean, it has absolutely nothing to do with anything I plan on being. And I'd also be able to sleep in in the morning. Ah, that sounds nice.

Spare... I went out for a walk in the rain, then I came back in and sat in the library and drew some more ideas for the makeup in the play.

I tried to teach some kids to say 'en majuscules' in foods class. Holy shit, it was hilarious, they just could not do it.

SO, we ended up taking an earlier flight on Tuesday since we didn't wanna get stuck in the hurricane. We got to Paris and holy merde, it's gorgeous there. I was acting like a fucking tourist with my pictures. I wrote mine and Spencer's names on the mother-fucking Eiffel Tower. Julie managed to get us some drinks so we sat outside the hotel and sung Grease songs. Then this girl came. This fucking girl...

Anyways, ended up going back to Montreal on Friday. Julie got all her stuff and we picked up Sam, since Papa's going on business trips and not gonna be able to stay home. Then this little girl decided to leave her little fucking Barbie bag at the top of the stairs at the airport. I've never been in so much pain before. My old man wheelchair's a pile of smelly scrap metal, too.


I'm started to get really scared about school. I mean, so many fucking people and I basically only know Emily, Kirsten and Spencer. I have no clue where classes are or how to say my teacher's name and I have to take some test to see if I know enough english >:O I'm being treated like a foriegn exchange student.


<b>edit;</b> <lj-cut text=""To Spencer"">

I actually have no clue how to start this off, let alone what I'm exactly trying to say. But I know that what I'm trying to get to is that I love you. I hope you know that. I make sure to tell you everyday just in case you forget. Every single fucking thing reminds me of you or something we've done so I sure as hell won't be forgeting anytime soon. You were my first everything. First real friend, first boyfriend, first kiss, first... just, everything that's ever meant something to me. So when I'm old with no hair and ugly shoes and multiple chins, I'm always gonna be able to think back at my first real summer love which by then will be so so much more.

I don't think I'll ever be able to thank you enough for just... accepting me. I still remember how scared I was when you would wrap your arm around me at the pizza place and how pissed I was at Emily's when you kissed me. But just look at where this has gotten us now. You have absolutely no idea how happy you make me. The way you show up at my door with dark circles under your eyes, just expecting to sleep in my bed. The way you chew gum after you have a cigarette so I can't smell it. The way you hold me when something's wrong. The way you refuse to let me wear a hat and fix my hair. The way you can just see right though me with your beautiful gray eyes.

Everytime I even think about you leaving me, my chest tightens, my eyes swell, I get a lump in my throat and my life without you is all I can really think about. I don't wanna go back to that."

"event","<font size=""1"">So after doing it with Spencer in the bathroom on Tuesday, I got on a plane and headed for the Montreal airport. I spent the whole trip listening to music. I had some lady sitting next to me. Her lipstick was really bright. She had a zebra print shirt on and I wanted to rip it off and wear it on my head.

FINALLY got to the Montreal airport. Julie and Papa were there. Julie's dyed her hair purple, it's looking fucking rad. Papa's gotten fatter and lost more hair. It was like, a 7-hour drive back to Sept-Iles. Stupid place hasn't changed a bit. It still smells like fish. My old room hasn't changed, either. It was... weird, walking back into there after so long. Anyways, only got to stay there for one night. Julie decided to take me camping :(

We went to some conservation area. It was nice, one of the rangers were really cute and he kept driving back and forth on the road in his sexy park pickup truck. Luckily we had Papa's trailer so we didn't have to sleep in a tent/on the floor/near the bugs. It was actually kinda boring. We went kayaking but I suck at it. Canoeing was kinda fun but I was scared a fish was gonna jump out of the water. We went for a walk in some forest. Apparently the owner's house was around there, guard dogs came down the trail and were like, barking and holy fuck, I've never been so scared. I just stood there holding onto Julie until she had to pry me off and yell at me to run. If Spencer was there he would have died. I never ran so fast in my life. As soon as we got off the trail they left us alone. We went back to the site and slept. Then we went to the park and laid in the grass and looked at the stars. We used to do that a lot when we were younger. We would just lay there in our Little Mermaid sleeping bag and pretend we could see constellations. Then we went and played chicken on the road going through the forest. She won and we went back and slept more. We got up, packed up, left, went home, showered, slept more then back in the car back to the airport.

I got like, 5 billion bug bites. My back's covered with them. My mom thinks I have a virus or something so she's put me to bed. They didn't start itching until I got back >:O

Then we went upstairs and... asdf.

Pierre, I'm sorry I kinda came off as a snob at your place. Just, yeah, stepfather problems."

"event","<font size=""1"">Yesterday was the worst day ever, and today was no better. It's history repeating.

Steve came over last night and I figured I'd bring him to Superfresh for one last game of shopping carts. It turned out to be the worst goodbye in the history of... goodbyes. I just lay there in the fucking parking lot crying because I'll never get to apologize to him. Then I got home and had the most marvelous suprise waiting for me.

Mama called me into her room and sat me down on her bed like she used to when I would pull Julie's hair. Only this time I would have to be apologizing to her. I just sat in her lap crying while she rocked me and tried to tell me that c'est bien, but just... asdf. She said she's gonna have to think of a punishment for me, but she's gonna forget about that in a bit. Dear stepfather, however, has been watching me like a hawk. Oh well, his fault for walking in on me and Spencer.

They called me home from Pierre's and they've been talking since I got back. I'm scared."

Mom & ""Dad"" are still on their stupid honeymoon, so I'm still safe for a few days at least. If I gave a shit I would try to put the money back. AND I STILL HAVE THOSE VODKA BOTTLE, WHAT DO I DO WITH THEM. Feel free to drop by to help me finish them off."

I love you even though you make fun of me, but it's all good because you fix my hair.</center>

I actually didn't stop laughing the whole time I drew that.

Anyyyyyways, we went dress shopping today. I got him to try on this really hot dress. It was like, short and strapless. AND HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO SHOW ME. Butttt, it was... nice, no matter how hard I laughed at it.

ASDF, it's 9:30 and we're still sitting in this stupid cafe without a motel.

We actually did end up finding a nice motel. Only thing is it only had like, 3 channels on tv. Spencer called me outside while he was having a cigarette. It was hailing. So we just sat there and watched it, then for some reason started singing Swing Swing. Then it started raining, so I brought him out to the parking lot and we were just laying in a puddle when it started thundering. Then we went back in and well, that's our business.

I spent all of yesterday in his boxers :). We ended up going to some diner and I was being difficult again, but it's all good. Thennnn, we went to the laundromat. It was empty so we found ways to amuse ourselves. Then we got pizza and slept outside under the stars. But now I would like to get out of this godforsaken state.

Oh, and Seb, when we get back we're so having that scene/coffee/chessplaying get together."

So we're somewhere in reall northern NC. I have no clue where the hell we are/where the hell we're going. I'm Canadian, I never studied American geography! 

Anyways, yes. So we're in some small town and we found this motel but the dude at the table was all bald + fat + sweaty + wearing a wifebeater that looked like it had never been washed so = gross. We ended up just going for a coffee. I decided to phone Maman, you know, just to let her know I'm okay and shit. Well, it turns out she flew to Vegas and got marriedddd. Hooray? Blah, then Spencer and I just sat around.

There was this woman watching us the whole time. It only hit me then that we're probably not gonna be able to go anywhere without this kinda homophobia shit.

We did end up finding a motel. I mean, the shag rug and comforter with millions of holes just adds to the marvelous decor. And the water doesn't exactly run clear, either.

Spencer's still sleeping. I just got back from the McDonald's across the street. They give out free water you know. And it's clean."

Naw, not really, we're just taking a road trip.

I'm pretty sure we have everything. Money, clothes, food, music. But right now, all I really fucking need is him. We ended up sleeping in the backseat and now my legs are having death cramps."

"event","<font size=""1"">Saturday- Went to some really awesome local show in some tavern. I think I lost my virginity in the pit, it was that intense.
Sunday- Went up to the cottage (again). Swam around because Mama's boyfriend and her went into town. Traffic was hell, I didn't think my cd player batteries would last.
Today- Spencer came over and we slept on the couch. We were both apparently really tired and in really bitchy moods, so it was for the best I guess. I love him."

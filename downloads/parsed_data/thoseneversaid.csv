"event","I was thinking yesterday and today about how much more I am dependent on technology than I've ever been in my life.  I used to be an avid reader but am only recently getting back into it on a regular basis.  It's not like me to go so long without it.  I mean, going for a couple of years without reading a book was just pathetic.  I used to do things other than come home from work to sit in front of either or both my laptop and television.  As of tomorrow, I'm going to take a voluntary hiatus, or as much of one as I possibly can, from such things.  No spending meaningless hours browsing websites I don't even really care about just because I can't think of anything better to do.  No watching shows I don't even care about just because I can't think of anything better to do.  No mindless texting because I can't think of anything better to do.  So what am I going to do instead?  Read, do things around the house that are beyond overdue, work on some sewing projects that I've been putting off for no reason other than laziness, FINALLY finish a t-shirt design that I've had NO creative energy to put towards (yes that will require the computer but I'm not going to use the internet).  I shall just listen to music.  I have so much music on both computers that I haven't even listened to.  I just stuck on a few artists at a time and listen to nothing else for long periods of time.

Anyway, I just think it's time to change things up.  I'm in yet another slump.  My life is pretty uneventful, unsocial, and just unfun.  Yeah, unfun."

"event","Have you ever listened to a cd that you haven't listened to in years and it magically puts you right back to that period in time in which you discovered it or you listened to it the most?  You know, your feelings, emotions and mental state - the way life felt back then in general.  I'm kind of in love with that aspect of music."

"event","I decided it was time to change my layout.  I can't say that I'm particularly in love with this one either but I couldn't take looking at my old one.  It had been the same for far too long.

It feels like there aren't enough hours in the day to accomplish half of what I want to.  Then I start to feel overwhelmed by all there is to do and then I don't do any of it.  Then everything ends up piling up more and more and more.  There are graphic design, photography, sewing, knitting, crocheting, drawing, and painting projects I want to work on but I just can't seem to keep up with them or even make a dent.  It's starting to drive me crazy.

I'm thinking about joining a gym or at least taking some type of class at one.  I'm thinking that if I actually spend the money to do it, I'll be compelled/obligated to go.  We'll see.  I already own a bike, treadmill, yoga and pilates dvds.  It's not like paying for those ever ended up making me use them consistently.  I really need to start getting some exercise though.  I can't take feeling like a slug anymore.

Moon Pies have absolutely no flavor.  Just an FYI."

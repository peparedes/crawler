That guy ended up inviting me over and we were having a great time, and it really seemed like he was flirting... then he brought up this girl from his old school 1000 miles away whom he likes and talks to all the time. Yay me. I&nbsp;got a bit&nbsp;irritated (gee, why, Blaire?) and talked to him about it, and he acted completely shocked that I&nbsp;thought he was &quot;flirting.&quot; According to him, that's just how senior guys act around all of their female friends.

???

Yeah.

But whatever, it was completely comfortable again after a while, and he kept up his... non-flirting... the rest of the night. And nothing's really changed at school. But I don't care much either way to be honest... he's not worth worrying over if he's still after this other girl after all this time.

Meanwhile, one of my guy friends from another school and I have started talking again, and I'm really glad, because I missed him - he used to be one of my best friends. :)"

"event","I know it's been forever, I haven't had much to write about. I kind of want to ask for some opinions/advice.

There's a guy in my chem class (please don't stop reading yet :P) who sits by me, and before this year I don't think I've ever met him. For the first few months of class I really didn't pay much attention to him. He seemed really shy, almost never talked. 

I was in a really bad relationship; so bad that often I ended up crying at school. Once I was crying and I walked in and tried to take notes, sort of covering my face so no one would notice. But the guy, who probably had never talked to me, asked me if I was okay. I just told him I was fine, but it meant a lot to me - he was so shy and didn't even know me. It happened more than once. Eventually we started talking more. I guess a little flirting happened - just the joking, laughing-constantly kind, nothing suggestive. But I was still sort of in that relationship so I made sure nothing really happened.

The relationship ended a month ago. And I've started to realize how nice this guy is. And out of nowhere on Monday, I realized I actually like him. He is so nice and funny and to be honest, he has the sweetest smile of anybody I've ever seen. We became friends on Facebook, and Tuesday he messaged me and we started talking. We talked for a while, then he said he had to go, and asked for my phone number. Almost immediately after we got off, he texted me and we ended up texting on and off for a lot of the day. Wednesday from after school until nearly midnight, we were texting almost constantly. And during chem we talk a lot and are always laughing.

Thursday he wasn't in a good mood and I was joking around and ended up making him angry. I felt bad but later he told me on facebook it was no big deal. Then we had this really long, weird conversation. He asked me if I was dating anyone and I said no, then he asked why not. I said there aren't always options, and he said something like how you have to look where you might not expect because you never know. I mentioned that I never know how to tell, and he said the worst that can happen is rejection, and why not just try? The whole conversation went like this, and I thought it was going somewhere, but he never came out and said anything. I asked why he brought it up and he just said he thinks I'm cool and deserve a boyfriend. And... that's all.

Gotta love guys, right? 

I decided to wait and see if he'd contact me on his own yesterday(Friday), but he never did... I ended up texting him around 8, but he was busy with something and we only exchanged a few messages. 

So if someone is so eager to talk to you for a while, and then doesn't contact you on his own, is he definitely not attracted or could he still be? Should I leave him alone and let him do whatever? It definitely seems like he likes me when we're talking... hmm. I can't remember how any of this is supposed to go, my other relationship was for over a year. Maybe it seems like I'm acting too fast after getting out of that relationship. But that relationship was doomed anyway, we just needed the guts to officially end it. And I'm fine emotionally now.

Anyone?"

You said, &quot;what have I done?&quot; You loved that&nbsp;lamb with every sinful bone and there you wept alone, your heart was so&nbsp;contrite.<br />5.&nbsp;There must be some word today from my girlfriend, so far away.&nbsp;<br />6. As the days&nbsp;go by I am asking why did you leave? You left me alone and then you walked out on me.&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't care.<br />7. I'll write down letters inside letters but I can't let her see; pass them forward with a foreword, they won't mean a thing.<br />8.

When we&nbsp;live&nbsp;between so many walls that I&nbsp;can barely breathe, you say that&nbsp;you just want someone but I'm the only one you need.<br />20. You're just the girl all the boys want to dance with and I'm just the boy&nbsp;losing too many chances.<br />21. You say love is a simple chemical reaction, can't&nbsp;say I agree.

"event","Today's my birthday &quot;party,&quot;&nbsp;if you want to call it - basically a movie day with friends. There will be cupcakes and other junk food, which I suppose helps with the party aspect.&nbsp;I hope it goes, and that everyone can come. I have a good feeling about it... my friends really aren't the dramatic type, and&nbsp;there are&nbsp;just a few coming&nbsp;- only my best guy friend, two close girl friends, and my boyfriend.

Only about&nbsp;a month left of school... I want it to end so much. Yesterday it was about 80 degrees, and after school my boyfriend and I spent more than an hour lying in&nbsp;a big grassy field near his house, just letting the sun shine on us. It made me remember how much I miss summer, and how much I want it this year more than I&nbsp;ever have. 

I'm trying to make my computer run faster. I've deleted all the programs&nbsp;we can do without and gone through a zillion files; I've gotten the used memory down to a little over a fourth of the total capacity. I'm not noticing much difference in the running speed, though. Does anyone have suggestions?&nbsp;I've run a defrag a couple of times (in between mass cleanouts), but that doesn't seem to do much."

"event","25 things about me. Post one in your journal too!<br /><br /><br />1. I love to write and I want to write for a living, but I've hardly penned a fictional word in months and I'm scared to death.<br />2. I think I'm in love but at the same time, it's hard to be sure. However, I am positive that I need him and my heart would shatter if he went away.<br />3. I'm sometimes scared of how people really see me. Lately I've had the worst self-esteem issues, and I just feel worthless.<br />4. I&nbsp;have crazy dreams, some of which scare me. The bad ones usually somehow reflect things I'm worried about or scared of but sometimes don't realize that I am.<br />5. The past couple of days I've been rearranging and going through everything in my room and I'm amazed at how much I've written. I have dozens of notebooks and hundreds of loose papers that really reflect a lot about my life when I wrote them, even though they're fiction.<br />6. I worry way, way too much.<br />7. Next to my best friend, who is nearly perfect academically and always scores those few points higher than me in everything, I&nbsp;sometimes feel worthless.<br />8. The&nbsp;Lord of the Rings movies have made me cry. It's usually from Sam and his amazing loyalty to Frodo... Sam's my favorite character purely because of that.<br />9. I love anything related to apples.<br />10. I&nbsp;don't care about most of his faults - love him more for them, even - but there's just the one that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to completely accept.<br />11. I&nbsp;cry way too much lately. I'm a walking fountain.<br />12. I've gone through periods of having amazing self-confidence and then, like now, times when I mostly hate myself.<br />13. None of my classes are really fun to me, yet I'm acing them all without much effort.<br />14. My coffee obsession died&nbsp;not very long after mom bought me a coffee maker last Christmas.<br />15. I will never, ever, ever be able to drop my habit of picking at/biting my nails. Ever.<br />16. I've never seen any of the Star Wars movies. I never will.<br />17. I get annoyed and I let it simmer. I try to get over it but it's difficult.<br />18. I&nbsp;hate being asked what's wrong when I'm upset, mostly by people who don't care but are just nosy.<br />19. I'm very sarcastic.<br />20. I&nbsp;looked up the symptoms of chronic depression and almost every one fits&nbsp;how I've felt for the past week or so.<br />21. Hopelessness is a really common feeling for me.<br />22. I&nbsp;want to be 16 so badly.<br />23. Maruchen is the best brand of ramen noodles (in my opinion).<br />24. I&nbsp;love the show <em>24</em> even though most of the gore in it makes me turn away and cover my eyes.<br />25. I'm afraid of change and not afraid of it at the same time."

"event","Things are pretty good, I&nbsp;suppose. A little insane. A little stressful. I like lists, so here you are:

1.&nbsp;Devon and I are a month and four days (and running). Things are absolutely great, he's more amazing every day... but this week has been hard. There was a paper he didn't turn in on time, so when progress reports came out he had an F in English. He's since turned the paper in and it should change his grade, but his English teacher has decided to be slow and not grade it yet (even though it's been a week). And until he brings home proof that his grade is up again, he's not allowed to see me out of school except on weekends. So I&nbsp;haven't spent a minute outside of class with him since Sunday. :/ It's not fun and has made this week, which is already bad enough being the last week before Christmas break, even longer. 

2. My brother's come home from college for two weeks... he's so different and yet exactly the same. We haven't gotten to talk much yet - the most I&nbsp;saw him was last night when he got here, and all of his friends came over. 

3. Christmas!!!&nbsp;It's hectic because I'm not even close to done with gifts (all of which are at least partially handmade), but thankfully I've got the money now to get everything I need.

4, Um... I&nbsp;dunno. Haha, truthfully there aren't a lot of separate things going on. Just major stuff that is making things crazy.&nbsp;I&nbsp;just felt like I was neglecting LJ, so here you are :)"

"event","I&nbsp;was on the phone with my boyfriend today and at one point, his little sister asked him to play Uno. He agreed because usually his sister's really whiney and immature, but she was in a good mood, so he played a few games while he was talking to me. It was okay, except that once or twice he stopped paying attention to what I&nbsp;was saying. No big deal, and he stopped playing after a little while, so it was fine. 

Then later, we both decided just for fun to make Miis of each other on our Wiis, just so we could kind of make fun of each other with it. We did that, then did a few games of bowling to see who was better. (On our separate game systems, of course.)&nbsp;While we were doing this, his sister joined in and I didn't mind at all since he was talking to me the whole time. Then after I decided to stop playing, his sister wanted to play tennis. So... he did. And this was no big deal at first, but then he had to plug his phone in and put it on speaker so he could still &quot;talk&quot; and move freely. Eventually, he started to just talk to his sister and kind of ignore me, to be frank. 

Yeah, this bugged me. It wasn't that he was playing with his sister - I&nbsp;know how she can be, so I&nbsp;was glad she was in a good mood for once&nbsp;- but I'd have preferred him just say &quot;hey, I'll talk to you later&quot;&nbsp;instead of just letting me sit there, feeling stupid, listening to them. So eventually I just said &quot;I&nbsp;have to go&quot;&nbsp;and got off the phone. 

The thing about me is that I am&nbsp;SO&nbsp;easily annoyed and angered. I probably shouldn't have been so irritated, but I&nbsp;really was. I&nbsp;sent him a text message a few minutes later, when I was&nbsp;still pretty&nbsp;wired,&nbsp;saying &quot;would it have been clearer if i'd just hung up without a word or something?&quot;&nbsp;He said &quot;what do you mean?&quot;&nbsp;And I replied with &quot;Just forget it. Have fun with your sister.&quot;&nbsp; 

After a couple more messages I'd calmed down and realized how stupid I was being, so I&nbsp;called (because communicating through text messages is pretty hard) and explained (haltingly, because my tear ducts were causing my voice to falter&nbsp;- yes, I AM&nbsp;that stupid) that I&nbsp;really wasn't that angry, that I just would rather him have gotten off the phone than make me sit there. And&nbsp;I expected - well, what reaction would YOU&nbsp;expect?&nbsp;I thought he would have been irritated at ME. Especially because of the text messages I&nbsp;said above, and the ones after - I&nbsp;was pretty sure that even though they were just typed words, he could tell I was snapping at him. But he was UNDERSTANDING. He apologized again (he'd done so in a text message also)&nbsp;and said that I was right, that he shouldn't have ignored me, that I&nbsp;wasn't really overreacting. That it was okay. All of this with no irritation or anger in his voice at all. 

How can someone be so understanding?&nbsp;Just the other day I was telling him that&nbsp;if anything messed us up, it would be me and my stupid temper. I&nbsp;was hoping never to be upset at him. And it ended up happening, and he didn't lash back, or decide&nbsp;I&nbsp;wasn't worth it anymore - he brushed over it with no problem. I'm still really surprised. Can someone really be that understanding, and care for me that much that even with my temper, I'm still worth it to him? 

I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;might have the best boyfriend in the world. I really do."

"event","I guess, since I'm, you know... a writer, I should update every now and then. And since I've been more active around here lately, why not make it a point to update every now and then? Hence, my writing updates.<br /><br />A lot going on, really. I'm working on my Harry Potter fanfiction WIP, <a href=""http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=249310""><em>Clandestine</em> </a>(15+), a lot. There are three chapters so far but I'm about half done with the fourth; I'm hoping to have that up this week. I'm also participating in a ton of challenges over at <a href=""http://says-skills.com"">SAYS</a>, and working on two one-shots of my own choice; ""Wishing Well"", a next-generation romance of sorts, and something else, which is entirely secret for the time being. A lot on my plate, I know... I really, really want to finish Wishing Well, but I seem to be stuck. I might try a rewrite, and see how that goes. I'd love to finish it by August.<br /><br />Original fiction-wise, there's also some major stuff going on. I'm outlining <em>Muse</em>, the idea I've been thinking about for months now&nbsp;- hopefully I can start writing soon, though I want to at least finish deciding on names first and have a basic outline planned out. This is something I'm very excited and hopeful about - I want to go all the way with this one,&nbsp;if there's any way I&nbsp;can.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm also working on my new idea for NaNoWriMo this year - it might be too complex to work out in 30 days, but I'm considering it. The other option, of course, is to write something completely incoherent - which would be fun, actually. I might just have to.<br /><br />That's basically it for right now - I haven't done a whole lot of poetry lately, aside from a couple of bits of crap. Hopefully that will pick up again soon."

"event","Yep. I'm making a list.&nbsp;And then I'm gonna make you make the same list. :D&nbsp;You love me, right?

1. Read my list.&nbsp;Giggle. Laugh. Roll&nbsp;eyes.&nbsp;Headdesk.
2. Make a&nbsp;list of your own in your&nbsp;journal. Or,you know,&nbsp;not.
3. By the way, I thought of this myself... even though it's probably freakishly similar to many other - what are they called - memes? Whatever. To me it's a list.

That's it!

1. I'm&nbsp;a&nbsp;very sarcastic person. (I'm POSITIVE you didn't know THAT one)
2. I&nbsp;have a very irrational fear of all insects.
3. I've&nbsp;never seen any of the Star Wars movies.
4. I don't&nbsp;care&nbsp;how awesome Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are, I will never in my life watch Brokeback Mountain.
5. I eat with my left hand, like a European, even though I'm right handed.
6. Adrien Brody, Casey Affleck, and Sean Astin, in tht order,&nbsp;are my three most favorite actors. (Sometimes I border fangirliness with them)
7. I read Pride and Prejudice when I was 12.
8. I was born approx. 1065 miles from where I live now.
9. I'm allergic to dust. Yep. Actually allergic to it.
10. I wrote my very first story (aside from mandatory school assignments) in a purple fuzzy notebook with a unicorn on the cover. (It had a matching fuzzy pen). I was seven.
11.&nbsp;I was a Neopets nerd when I was younger. On the account I actually kept track of, I think I had around a million Neopoints. Lmao.
12. I have no tonsils! Or atenoids! And these fascinating disappearances both occurred at the same time! Yay.
13. I've been called ""effervescent."" (Gahhhh, that made me giggle. In a good way.)
14. I've also been called ""emo."" (That made me giggle more. In a not-good way.)
15. I'm over 50% Irish.
16. I'm very jumpy - I emit an awkward, squeak-like noise when I'm startled (which is often :P).
17. I like smileys :D
18. My dad knew Tim McGraw when he was a kid. (Which has nothing to do with me. I don't even like country music.)
19. I don't like the Twilight books. (And I'm perfectly prepared for the&nbsp;rabid fangirls' attacks against me.)
20. I'm a Christian.
21. I'm not interested in myself enough to make this list longer, so I'm cutting it at 21."

"event","&nbsp;I thought I had more control over my emotions than this.<br /><br />Does it make any sense that I'm crying right now&nbsp;- because I'm both happy and sad? I don't really know what's going on right now. I just found out that one of my close guy friends - we haven't had much contact lately, but he's still close - now has a girlfriend. And this has sent me into some stupid situation comprised of tears and a hopeless feeling, and I'm not quite sure why.<br /><br />I know it's not because I've got feelings for him, or I'm jealous, because neither of those are true. I'm really happy for him, actually - he deserves it more than anyone else I know does. I guess it just - it makes me think about my own relationships. Or more appropriately, my lack of them. Can it really be normal to have so many failed attempts at relationships and so few successful ones? It never seems to happen for me. I'm always a mix of bad timing and just plain not good enough, and it kind of sucks, you know? There are time when I can hardly breathe because I feel so alone and away from the world, and that <em>hurts</em> - it really does. And I don't know how to remedy it. I just don't."

Just wanted to check in and let you know that a friend of mine, Sophie (LadySophieKitty), has created a new community called <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/pencil_posse/"">The Pencil Posse</a>. It's for writers, obviously... basically, the intent is to help writers who need advice or who are struggling to finish something... well, finish it.

The week after that will be the school play, and after that, I'll just&nbsp;have schoolwork&nbsp;to deal with, and not too much of that, since there'll be less than a month left. Till then, I don't have a lot of time to write so I haven't been working on anything serious - just some short stuff and poetry. It's strange how sometimes I can't seem to stop writing poetry. Then again, I do have a muse... but that's another story. 

We're going to Chicago for the band trip - I can hardly believe it's almost here. We're going to get to do so many things - the best of all (in my oh-so-humble opinion) being going to see the Blue Man Group!!! I'm so excited. And we'll get to go shopping, and see other places, and have tons of fun and not get any sleep. I can't wait."

"event","&nbsp;So, what's been going on with me lately? HMM, well... to summarize it, you'd have to have several hours free (plus plenty of extra sanity handy) if I had to tell you everything. As it is, I think I'll make it short. 

I've realized something about a certain someone and I - a certain someone that has been on my mind a lot. The thing I realized is - well, it can potentially change everything, but I can't let myself think about it yet. Let's just say I need to hold on a little longer. So that thought has been pushed to the back of my mind, making room for everything else that's going on lately. 

School is taking up most of my time, and thought, really. I have large amounts of homework on a daily basis, and some of my teachers never actually know what they're talking about, so&nbsp;I have to try my best to conform to their insanity. Then, there's the stupid-people-who-hate-other-people-for-no-reason-other-than-they-don't-submit-to-others'-snide-comments-and-crap thing. But I try not to let that bother me. 

High school sucks, though. It really does. 

In other news, lots of award shows lately. There was the Golden Globes&nbsp;(if you can call that a show, seriously, was anyone else as ticked about that as my brother and I were?), the SAGs last night, and next month, the Grammys, and... THE OSCARS! EEEK! I love the Oscars. My brother and I are movie freaks, and this kind of thing is something we actually talk about/watch together, which is awesome. I just really hope that the writer's strike doesn't affect the ceremony. I will be REALLY upset. 

Well, not much else going on. I'm trying desperately to write at least SOMETHING every day, and I'm getting better about it, I guess, but I really need to work harder if I'm ever going to finish something good. I should probably get on that now... talk to you later!"

He had some amazing news to share with everyone who'd listen today.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of this included signing a distribution label to Militia Records, which means they will help put his music in stores all over the place; starting his own record label with himself as the first band signed to it with plans to add others; and much, much more. Read today's entry on his blog to know everything.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm excited - incredibly so. Not only to hear more of Chad's music and to see it in stores (!), but when I read all of his news and realized what a big year this is going to be for him, I somehow began to feel that maybe it means something for me as well. I felt indescribably relieved - I mean, I've been worrying like crazy for the past couple of weeks, and almost as much for months - 2007 has been - was - a difficult year for me. But I suddenly felt a little better - maybe a lot, after reading his blog. I think that this year is going to be looking up HUGELY from the last twelve months.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is amazing, indescribably so. I've never felt this - relieved. Not in a really long time - none of the dozens of things that have been on my mind are really bothering me now. And I am swearing to myself that&nbsp;I'm going to hang onto&nbsp;this feeling&nbsp;no matter what - even if I have to walk around everywhere with a picture of Chad Sugg in my pocket.</p>"

"event","I know,&nbsp; the second post in two days. Wild, right?

I just need to kind of talk, to someone (or no one) who doesn't know any of my friends and won't be biased or a gossip, etc. And here you are, my wonderful livejournal. which no one reads. But hey... I love you anyway!

I need to figure things out and somehow my mind isn't letting me do that.&nbsp;I'm confused, because I don't know what to do and it's killing me and I feel like I'm at an impasse. If I try and talk to him about it, I seriously risk ruining this great friendship I have. But if I don't talk about it it'll just sit here and simmer underneath the surface, and at some point I'm going to blow up or break down. And the worst part is, I might love him&nbsp;- I don't think so for sure yet, but I'm either close or there already. And I don't want to say that because I don't want to come off as the type who just jumps into things without thinking them through... but I've thought about this a lot. Only problem is, this thinking isn't getting me far, because my mind won't let me sort everything out into neat little piles. I and my O.C.D. are very ticked at my mind for this reason.

So yeah. Any random readers who want to give me advice? I'll take almost anything."

"event","<p>It's been a while since my last post.<br /><br />Since then, I have written 50,000 words in a month, brought my English grade back up to an A, started several more writing projects, read one of the most amazing books I've ever discovered, completed a few short stories, started even more writing projects, and FINALLY BEGUN TO REWRITE MY NANO NOVEL!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I'm jazzed. I mean, I can't wait to have a finished novel on my hands. I'm so proud of what I've already written - imagine when it's done. I mean, it definitely needs some work, but I'm sure it can be improved greatly.<br /><br />Of course, I've only rewritten the first two paragraphs. But hey - a little at a time.</p>"

"event","I've got it now. I have an idea that I just might&nbsp;be able to make work. 

I can't explain&nbsp;here, for several reasons, one being that it's a barely&nbsp;developed&nbsp;plot, but I can tell you that I'm excited. 


About other things... 

I've been picking up signals from... someone. This someone, unfortunately, has a date to homecoming - but to my extreme delight, I've noticed that there's nothing between them and she only asked him out of need for a date. He and I are much more comfortable together than he is with her. And before you start hating me - this sounds cruel, but really it isn't. They barely&nbsp;know each other, and she simply&nbsp;asked him because she wanted a date.&nbsp;I wouldn't be&nbsp;intruding on anything, as&nbsp;far as I can tell. So... yay? I think so! 

My brother and I&nbsp;are&nbsp;growing closer, finally. I guess everyone else was right - he has finally started to grow up. He just graduated last year, and now he talks to me a lot more. Unfortunately, he's moved into&nbsp;Dad's apartment, half an hour away. But&nbsp;we still get to see each other sometimes. Which is good.&nbsp; 

School's going surprisingly well - I've got better grades than I expected in two classes that I'd been worried about, and although in one I don't have what I want, I can easily bring it up before report card time. My goal is all A's, as often as possible - because of the GPA thing, obviously. I don't want to screw it up this early. But it's nearly an A, so no worries as of yet. And in the other classes, I'm fairly sure I've got good marks as well. Purdue, here I come! (...) 

Anyway, going to dinner at Dad's. Then, helping Mom with some baking, and going (finally) to watch the boys' soccer game today. With being in girls' soccer myself, I barely ever have time to go. I'll try to update again soon!"

"event","<p>Sorry for not writing. I've tried several times, but once the computer booted me off and once... um, well, I don't exactly remember. Uh... my cat ate it?&nbsp; *shrugs* Anyway.... So I've got an issue that I need to deal with soon, or I'm in trouble. I've got half of September and all of October before November comes - a month and a half, that's it, which is nothing with soccer, band, and school - and along with it, National Novel Writing Month.<br /><br /><br />What's the problem? you ask. Why are you freaking out? I'll tell you why. NaNoWriMo is forty-six days away, and <em>I don't have an idea.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></em>I should have a well-thought-out plot by now, well-rounded with all the names of my characters memorized. I should be outlining like crazy, filling up my hard drive with so many word documents that my computer is beginning to get mad at me. But I don't even have an idea! I mean, I did. I thought I did. But with a goal of fifty thousand words in one month, my idea needs to be something that I can write out with no problem, and no shadow of writer's block looming over me. I just realized that my idea is not one of those. No, it's something&nbsp;I will struggle greatly with and probably should save for when I have a few years to spare.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />And it's really important to me that I do this. I mean, it could really help me on my way to finally finishing an original novel - or at least, a good huge chunk of it. So what do I do? I'm trying to think, but so far... nothing. EEK! Wish me luck!</p>"

"event","<p>Yesterday was eventful. I went to a baseball game with my best friend and his parents. Yes, his parents - his kind, hardworking, dinner-cooking mother and his alcoholic, smoking, porn-addicted father. It was the Indians versus the Royals - not that that matters, I'm not a huge fan of teams in particular - I just like to watch the game.<br /><br />On the way back from the game (Indians won, if you care), I was basically on the edge of my seat hoping four beers hadn't dulled the senses of my best friend's father too much. Twenty minutes away from home, we stopped at a little restaurant called Blazin' Bill's. After being seated, we looked at the menus discussing what to order. Twenty minutes later, a waitress appeared and asked for drink orders.<br /><br />Obviously, by now, we were ready to order our food as well. So we did, and we waited... and waited... and waited. at about 6:00&nbsp;- an hour after we'd arrived - the food got there. We never thought it would. But it did, and we ate, and then waited another half-hour for the check. At last when we got out of there - an hour and a half after we'd come in - we left. My friend's dad had had two cigarrettes while we were still eating, and I got into the car and leaned my head against the back of the seat, trying not to inhale.<br /><br />Today I had an orthodontist appointment - and it took forever, this time. Even longer, it seemed, than normal. And the girl really hurt my teeth and gums. I hate when they're not careful.<br /><br />Nothing else to do today - I got my new Wii hooked up and I might play that - and tomorrow I'm home alone all day. Wednesday will be fun&nbsp;- the new Harry Potter movie and a few hours at the mall with my other best friend. Sure will be fun.<br /><br />Writing's going well for the most part. I'm anxious for November - has anyone else heard of NaNoWrMo? Anyway, I'm excited. As I also am for band camp to start. He, he.</p>"

Which I can hardly believe.<br /><br /><br />Of course, it's mostly because I miss my friends. I've been gone for a week and usually I see them every other day. The friends I'm talking about are really close ones, which I only have a few of, and right now I really want to see them.<br /><br />And, I don't want to go to my grandmother's church tomorrow. I don't want to be forced to go to a church that isn't mine and where I don't know anyone... especially while I'm on vacation.<br /><br />But tomorrow I have to get up and go to a church that's eighty-five percent old people. And I haven't even washed my hair yet.<br /><br />I don't really know why, but I feel so... off, right now.<br /><br />And there's someone else I'm missing... someone I can't really tell that too.<br /><br />There's not even a good book store in this town.<br /><br />How depressing. I sound emo, almost.<br /><br />Well, I'm not going to write anymore for the risk of getting more depressed, so I'll talk to you sometime later.<br /><br /><br />Going to wash my hair now. Bye.</font></p>"

"event","<p>I randomly decided to post an entry here, seeing as I hadn't in a while.<br /><br /><br />Fanfiction's going pretty well, I've got several works in progress that look good so far.<br /><br /><br />Tomorrow I've got ortho, just me though instead of both me and my brother, because one of the brackets came loose since my last appointment. I hope it stays on this time, because I don't want the annoyance of a loose bracket during vacation, which starts June 29th.<br /><br /><br />We'll be visiting a bunch of family and friends - well, friends as in my mother's friends, none of mine - and come back halfway through July. Oh, joy. Boy, do I love car traveling.<br /><br /><br />Thursday or Friday I'm going to my best friend's house, to (finally) be able to play his Nintendo Wii that his dad randomly bought him about a month ago. Yes, his abusive, alcoholic, porn-addicted father decided to buy his son&nbsp;an expensive video game console out of the blue, three months away from his birthday and six months before Christmas. I really don't get that.<br /><br /><br />I'm gonna close this up now - short entry, I know - but I'm tired and am thinking of going to bed soon.<br /><br /><br />It's 11: 35, now, by the way.</p>"

"event","<p>I haven't been on here in awhile. Dunno why. Maybe because I've been extremely busy. Being a striving writer (even though i'm not really striving <em>seeing as</em> everything's paid for <em>seeing as </em>I still live at home <em>seeing as </em>I'm still a minor), going to school every day, and other various things have kept me busy. But now school's out, and I'm still trying to write - well, not much, I admit. The only thing I've really been writing lately is fanfiction, which STILL&nbsp;COUNTS because it's basically practice for me, since it doesn't make me depressed when it's not that good because I can get away with it when it's fanfiction, whereas when I'm writing something original and it's bad it hurts my ego severely. So anyway, I'm less busy and I'll try and update more often now.<br /><br />Hm... not much else to say. That's the sad part. I seem to just write an intro to every post, and then....<br /><br />Who am I kidding? No one's reading this anyway. What does it matter?</p>"

"event","I'm really bored right now. Actually, I have something to do- homework. But since I'm a procrastinator, I'm going to make&nbsp;a list of books I think everyone in the world should read. Don't judge me because I'm crazy, please. Oh- and just so you know, my pathetic summaries can in no way capture the greatness of the books I am about to list.<br /><br /><br /><font size=""2"">1) <em>Twilight </em>by Stephenie Meyer: Bella,&nbsp;a sixteen-year-old girl, moves to a small, rainy town called Forks to live with her father and meets Edward Cullen, mysterious and alluring. He has a secret; she's determined to figure it out. Meanwhile, she's quickly falling in love...<br /><br />2) <em>New Moon </em>by Stephenie Meyer (sequel to <em>Twilight</em>): Bella has to cope with Edward leaving, and she becomes best friends with Jacob Black, who just might be able to help fill that void.<br /><br />3) <em>Blood and Chocolate </em>by Annette Curtis Klause: Vivian, a werewolf, meets and falls in love with a human, and she wants to show him what she really is. When she does, however, she discovers that he is not really as wonderful as he seems to be.<br /><br />4) <em>The Silver Kiss </em>by Annette Curtis Klause: Zoe is struggling with her best friend's move and her mother sick with cancer, and then she meets Simon, who seems to actually understand what she's feeling. A vampire, he's just as lonely as she, living eternally damned and hiding from the sun. They can help each other, in ways they never imagined.<br /><br />Those are just a few of the books I've read lately, but the best, since they stuck so well. Try them out!<br /><br />*Lameness ends here*</font>"

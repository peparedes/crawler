"event","I'm feeling a bit odd lately. There's a chat I go to, and I've begun to feel really distant from people. Its almost like people are sick of me. Perhaps I'm there so often, that my name is just a fixture over in the corner. ""Oh hi Anae... how's thi--... oh hey _______ ltns!"" I know I'm over-reacting, and no one has turned their back on me, but it almost feels like it. I don't expect any kind of special status for being around that chat since '99. I guess people changed and so did I. It makes me feel quite petty though, almost like I'm just coming for attention. :o/ Oh well, what can you do, right? -sigh- Enough whining..."

"event","I'm trying to decide what is more important to me. Going to therapy, I've missed my last two appointments. Or going to a meeting with my case manager about getting into a job rehab. program, which also gives me medical and prescription coverage. It seems like a simple enough decision, but I have the worst time with making important choices. I need the therapy of course, but I also need a job, and medical coverage. And while I'm at the meeting I can also apply for other types of assistance. 
Well.... I guess I don't really need to choose, all the important stuff revolves around the job rehab. meeting. I need to be self-sufficient one of these days, or at least survive to the best of my abilities. Besides, I need to do something to get my father off my case.. he keeps nagging at me about getting a job. He doesn't understand me.. I don't blame him. So I'll go to the job rehab. meeting... kill a few birds with one huge ****** boulder. At least he'll be happy.. maybe I'll have some luck there too. 
Will let you know what happens...."

"event","Tortured souls shuffle past in worn, yellow terrycloth robes, 
a sadistic attempt at cheerfulness. 
Pacing the long sterile halls
muttering to unseen companions walking beside them,
offering steadying arms. 
Sometimes a flicker of recognition in those dead eyes, 
but only rarely, signifies a life still haunts the gaunt frame 
hunched under the almost too heavy material. 
Only rarely does someone from the outside venture in, 
and then only for a moment, 
to wander down the darkened halls only to flee. 
Never again will that face be seen behind the cold iron gate, 
their sense of reality heightened by the unforgettable terrors 
witnessed within those desolate corridors. 
At the end of a distant hall, a figure sits hunched over on the cold ceramic tiling. 
Catatonic except for partially coherent eyes 
darting from face to face trying desperately to avoid the vacant stares 
of the others. 
Isolated by the fact that she is the only one 
who still remembers the outside, the sunset's rosy hues setting the hilltops ablaze. 
Unlike the others, she is a periodic visitor, 
never staying more than a few weeks 
to collect the scattered thoughts that brought her to her knees. 
The only one with hope for the future. 
She knows she is not like them, 
that she still owns her life, 
for the moment. 
Yet she keeps returning to this dungeon painted with rainbows, 
the only safe place left for her in a world that has denied her. 
Her eyes slowly close as she draws in a deep breath 
that releases her from her trance. 
She stands, as if manipulated like a ragdoll, 
and numbly makes her way to an unmarked door 
that leads her out of the prison in her mind 
just in time to hear the bell for second period."

"event","Its a wonder what music can do for one's state of mind. A certain song at one moment can be empowering, and the next it can steal away with parts of your mind, taking you off on a journey. Sometimes good, sometimes bad... and always powerful. Words alone are mighty, as well as music. Put them together and............"

"event","Consider the noble centipede...

I am not a fan of the many many legged. I remember watching one with fascination in a childhood garden, but things took a downturn after. The key moment was the night of my final Final exam (philosophy of maths) when I got up to go to the loo, saw a centipede making its earnest curvy path across the bathroom rug, had complete hysterics and woke my partner of the time to get up and deal with the monster. Poor man, he ventured through and instead of the three foot monstrosity I had described, he found a piece of fluffy string. He flushed it and returned to tell me the monster was vanquished. I was unsure of his sincerity and required him to return with me and THERE IT WAS processing across the floor! Clearly, it had lain in wait for me.

Seventeen years later, the first centipede of my solo existence looped and curved across the floor towards me last night. I am awed by my own bravery in capturing it, having hysterics as it strove mightily to escape its juice glass prison, sliding my polling card below it and then throwing it out the window.  It was sort of reddish, and it had many legs. Probably some of those legs had venomous claws on them. 

Because they are territorial, it is unlikely I will see another for a while. Because they eat other insects, I am a little worried about untidy neighbours having some kind of infestation, and have resolved to be extra scrupulous about cleaning my floors. Because I live alone, and a hysterical terror of small creatures that can't really hurt me all that much is unbecoming, I have resolved to learn to love the centipede.

So I am trying to admire the creature's sinuous grace. It was really a very fetching shade of red. There was a lovely symmetry about the many body sections, and the long bits on its bum that looked like antennae matched the actual antennae on its head. It is a noble hunter, and lives in solitary splendour, defending its territory and preying on many much more destructive creatures. It... let me catch it? It enterprisingly crawled its way up to a first floor flat...

I am not sure I will be able to love the centipede."

My soul is never required of <i>me</i>
It always has to be someone else of course
Will my soul be required of me tonight perhaps?

(I often wonder what it will be like
To have one's soul required of one
But all I can think of is the Out-Patients' Department - 
'Are you Mrs Briggs, dear?'
No, I am Scorpion.)

I should like my soul to be required of me, so as
To waft over grass til it comes to the blue sea
I am very fond of grass, I always have been, but there must
Be no cow, person or house to be seen.

Sea and <i>grass</i> must be quite empty
Other souls can find somewhere <i>else.</i>

O Lord God please come
And require the soul of thy Scorpion

Scorpion so wishes to be gone.

 I look across the table and think
 (fiery with love)
 Ask me, go on, ask me
 to do something impossible,
 something freakishly useless,
 something unimaginable and inimitable

 Like making a finger break into blossom
 or walking for half an hour in twenty minutes
 or remembering tomorrow.

 I will you to ask it.
 But all you say is
 Will you give me a cigarette?
 And I smile and,
 returning to the marvelous world
 of possibility
 I give you one
 with a hand that trembles
 with a human trembling.

 The art of losing isn't hard to master;
 so many things seem filled with the intent
 to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

 Lose something every day.  Accept the fluster
 of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
 The art of losing isn't hard to master.

 Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
 places, and names, and where it was you meant
 to travel.  None of these will bring disaster.

 I lost my mother's watch.  And look! my last, or
 next-to-last, of three loved houses went.
 The art of losing isn't hard to master.

 I lost two cities, lovely ones.  And, vaster,
 some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
 I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.

 ---Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
 I love) I shan't have lied.  It's evident
 the art of losing's not too hard to master
 though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.

"event","Why should I let the toad work
  Squat on my life?
Can't I use my wit as a pitchfork
  And drive the brute off?

Six days of the week it soils 
  With its sickening poison -
Just for paying a few bills!
  That's out of proportion.

Lots of folk live on their wits:
  Lecturers, lispers,
Losels, loblolly-men, louts-
  They don't end as paupers;

Lots of folk live up lanes
  With fires in a bucket,
Eat windfalls and tinned sardines-
  they seem to like it.

Their nippers have got bare feet,
  Their unspeakable wives
Are skinny as whippets - and yet
  No one actually starves.

Ah, were I courageous enough 
  To shout Stuff your pension!
But I know, all too well, that's the stuff
  That dreams are made on:

For something sufficiently toad-like
  Squats in me, too;
Its hunkers are heavy as hard luck,
  And cold as snow,

And will never allow me to blarney
  My way of getting
The fame and the girl and the money
  All at one sitting.

I don't say, one bodies the other
  One's spiritual truth;
But I do say it's hard to lose either,
  When you have both.

The flow of psychological time is an illusion based on the rapid replacement of these capsules. Each mind computes the measure of time passing and duration from the decay of the surface present in relation to a core of past events. As each new surface is generated, that surface, the rim of the immediate past, recedes in the wake of rising contents. This recession, an uncovering of phases latent in the original traversal, exposes layers in the past forming the content of the immediate past moment. The surge of the microgeny to a surface that dissolves the instant it appears, the priority of the Self in the unfolding sequence, the feeling of agency, create a Self in a state of becoming, a Self that travels in time like the crest of a wave, always in pursuit of a future just beyond the grasp of the present.<br /><br />PMID: 2285510 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]<br /><br />How beautiful is this?</dd></span>"

I felt a sudden hot sear as if a red-hot iron had been pressed to my thigh. There was a crash as ______'s pistol came down on the man's head. I had a vision of him sprawling upon the floor with blood running down his face while _________ rummaged him for weapons. Then my friend's wiry arms were round me, and he was leading me to a chair.

'You're not hurt, ________? For God's sake, say that you are not hurt!'

It was worth a wound - it was worth many wounds - to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.

'It's nothing, _________. It's a mere scratch.'

He had ripped up my trousers with his pocket-knife.

'You are right,' he cried with an immense sigh of relief. 'It is quite superficial.' His face set like flint as he glared at our prisoner, who was sitting up with a dazed face. 'By the Lord, it is as well for you. If you had killed _______, you would not have got out of this room alive. Now, sir, what have you to say for yourself?'"

I believe there is something else

entirely going on but no single
person can ever know it,
so we fall in love.

It could also be true that what we use
everyday to open cans was something
much nobler, that we'll never recognize.

Green Snake, when I hung you round my neck
and stroked your cold, pulsing throat
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;as you hissed to me, glinting
arrowy gold scales, and I felt

and the whispering silver of your dryness

Green Snake--I swore to my companions that certainly
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you were harmless! But truly
I had no certainty, and no hope, only desiring
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to hold you, for that joy,

The recent removal of the Carol Anne Duffy poem &quot;Education for Leisure&quot; from the list of 'texts you might be examined on' &nbsp;for being too topical and relevant indicates to me why teachers' freedom to choose the texts they teach is so very very important. <br /><br /><br /><u>Mrs Schofield's GCSE</u><br /><br /><em>The poem Carol Ann Duffy penned in response to her work being removed from a GCSE curriculum</em><br /><br />You must prepare your bosom for his knife,<br />said Portia to Antonio in which<br />of Shakespeare's Comedies? Who killed his wife,<br />insane with jealousy? And which Scots witch<br />knew Something wicked this way comes? Who said<br />Is this a dagger which I see? Which Tragedy?<br />Whose blade was drawn which led to Tybalt's death?<br />To whom did dying Caesar say Et tu? And why?<br />Something is rotten in the state of Denmark - do you<br />know what this means? Explain how poetry<br />pursues the human like the smitten moon<br />above the weeping, laughing earth; how we<br />make prayers of it. Nothing will come of nothing:<br />speak again. Said by which King? You may begin.<br /><br />(You will find the banned poem at the end of this article&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/sep/04/gcses.english"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/sep/04/gcses.english</a> )"

Thistles
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Against the rubber tongues of cows and the hoeing hands of men
Thistles spike the summer air
And crackle open under a blue-black pressure.

Every one a revengeful burst
Of resurrection, a grasped fistful
Of splintered weapons and Icelandic frost thrust up

From the underground stain of a decayed Viking.
They are like pale hair and the gutturals of dialects.
Every one manages a plume of blood.

Then they grow grey like men.
Mown down, it is a feud. Their sons appear
Stiff with weapons, fighting back over the same ground.

On Friday the yellow dress gets its first airing. I am hoping for decent weather (naturally) and also hoping to get its shift and apron all done. It's all cut out in lovely crisp linen, and I just need to do it. Possibly start tonight - I can't see it taking forever and it would be SO good for me to get that one thing off my plate. It would actually be great to get a couple of aprons done - I was reminded my last larp event why they are such a good thing when I slipped in a muddy field and was able, by swiftly removing my apron, to restore myself almost immediately to something almost presentable. Provided you weren't regarding the bottom four inches of skirt. And - why would you?

Sewing - all in all, much more fun than marking."

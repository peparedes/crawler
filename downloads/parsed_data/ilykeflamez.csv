"event","Can you believe it's been exactly 3 YEARS since I've last updated?? A lot has changed, some better and some worse, and I&nbsp;wasn't going to post anything but since it's my anniversary with LJ I might as well lol.

I'm still with&nbsp;Sean and we have a beautiful daughter, Ariel, who is already 1 years old! She was born in May of '09 and she is my world. I currently do not have a job nor am I&nbsp;attending school like I should be, but it's tough right now and no one apparently wants to hire someone who's been out of a job for 2 years. As you might be able to tell I'm still in DE, no AZ for us lol.

That's really about it, my life isn't all that different except that most of my time is now spent with&nbsp;Holly and Jessica lol.

Maybe I'll make this a daily thing, maybe not, but until next time, au revoir. &lt;3"

Anyways, it's on my back and this is what it looks like: <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ilykeflamez/pic/00001eza/""><img width=""240"" height=""105"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ilykeflamez/pic/00001eza/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a></div><br />So other than that nothing is really new or exciting. I'm just hoping it doesn't snow up here until I get home so then I won't have to drive in that mess. Yup, so I'll try to get on here more often now because I can and try to keep everything up to date..."

"event","Wow, first update in what, a year? Something like that.

So I'm going to Cedar Crest College in Allentown, PA which is about 5 minutes from Dorney Park, so guess where I'm gonna be all year, lol. Luckily, Lindsay's going to college in Philly so we can see each other regularly and Holly will still be in DE so I can visit her when I come back home. The only person that I'll be away from and miss is Jess whom I rarely talk to anymore. *sigh* I'm just glad I'm done with all that high school shit and drama. Totally not worth it.

I can't wait til my 18th birthday!!! I'm totally gonna get stuff pierced and tattooed. It will be fun... I hope. Anyways, it's coming up soon and I'll be in college... I don't think I'm ready for it. I mean, I'm ready to be off on my own, but I don't want to start classes and stuff. Gah.

No one will probably read this, but that's ok since this is probably my last post... again. I'll see you guys again hopefully, but until then, adieu."

Lindsay was supposed to come with me, but she can't unless she finds someone to fill in for her at work... not unlikely, so that bites big time. So my mom is gonna go with me, which means I still get to go, but it's not the same. I'll still have some fun though. But I GET TO SEE CHICAGO!!!!!!! I don't even care if it's a broadway cast or not, but I have no idea where it is. I forget where it's at too... oops. I'm going to bed now, ciao!</P>"

"event","Heehee, I'm watching Finding Nemo for the first time in like, a year. So I finally saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and it was awesome! I saw it two times and I'm not tired of it yet.

Omg guys, I saw SAW II yesterday and it was AMAZING. You should def. go see it, but u have to see the first one before you see the second. It IS required by me cuz I said so. Let's just say you won't get about half the movie if you don't.

So next week's Showstoppers and it's so weird cuz it feels like we haven't prepared nething for it at all when we have. I just don't wanna sit in Ms. Eldreth's room during the day cuz it gets soooo boring especially since I'm not in the first act at all. Grr, and Tori's gonna be there. SAVE ME! So does ne1 kno if we have a show Thursday or Friday during the day cuz I have no clue and my mom's friend wants to come see it during the day on Thurs. and I need to kno if we have a show.

So the past two days have been wonderful cuz naturally my mom had to work yesterday and my dad was gone for some reason and Nick went to Joe's house, so I was alone! Of course by the time I got back from the movies, my dad was home, but that's ok. Today I was alone until about 2:30 cuz my parents went furniture shopping cuz we're getting a new living room. Whoop whoop.

So that's about it, and I guess I'm done. See u guys on Monday. Ciao!"

Last night I got the CUTEST purse, but you'll have to wait til school to find out what it is... <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/laughing.gif"" width=15>&nbsp;and I got the Josh Gracin CD last night, the Nightmare before Christmas soundtrack, and the Phantom of the Opera DVD. </P>
<P>I can't really say this is the ""best birthday ever"" when in actuality it's not really that great. I was supposed to hang out with Jessica today, but I called her and she wasn't home. I left&nbsp;a message, but she never called me back. I even saw her at the mall last night and she said she still wanted to do something. Another thing, my dad hasn't even told me happy birthday. Wtf is up with that?! I don't like him that much, but he could at least say ""happy birthday"" once or something.</P>
<P>So I'm watchin Hook right now and I love this movie just for the dinner scene where Peter starts imagining again. I just mainly want the desserts but... o well. </P>
<P>Omg, I love Stephanie's present! She got me a necklace that has 2 pics of Rupert Grint in it, a bracelet w/ 5 pic of Rupert Grint, and a Harry Potter candle. Lindz got me a really cute blue and black sweater thing and a pretty blue necklace that matches almost perfectly. </P>
<P>Right now I really wanna go to Party City and get one of those outfits that Lindz, Steph and I were lookin at. Urgh, I have enough money for one but I don't feel like going right now. Maybe I'll go after school w/ Lindz and I'll get one or something.</P>
<P>K, well I've bored u people enough, and I'm done. In about an hour I get to go eat chinese food! And it's supposedly even bigger than the one in Bear that we already go to. MORE CHINESE FOOD!!!! Haha, I'm such a fatty... k bye!</P>"

"event","NO MORE SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am so excited, you have nooooo idea. Well Tori's party was today after school and it was... ok. Pretty boring but o well... got me away from home and I got to go swimming. So Tori's a pretty crappy host cuz at the end she decides to leave w/out checking to make sure that all of her friends had rides home so I ended up takin Kathryn and Jimmy to my house, which was fun so I didn't really care but that fact that she didn't care about her friends that much to make sure they got home safely. THAT ticked me off the most. 

So now I have to go to Butterball's tomorrow to help her dye her tips like I did mine, so I'm prolly gonna use the leftovers to re-dye my tips, which would be hot. 

K, well I'm gonna go to bed so she doesn't wake me up tomorrow, ugh!"

"event","Whoo, been a while again... Well to catch u up, I had to work forever on my french projects. Yes, PROJECTS. I had to do a PowerPoint, in French of course, and I had to make a display board, u guess it, in French. It totally sucked and I think I still have an F in it for the 3rd marking period. My mom is totally gonna kill me... then I won't be allowed to go to France next year. Grrrr... She probably won't let me go newayz cuz I'm not takin French and she'll probably make up some stupid ""rule"" that you have to take French to go on the trip. Well if that's the case, then I'll just ask for my money back, cuz there is NO way that I'm going to hell for another year. K, enuf about that. Let's see, Sunday I was at church all friggen day, then I was talkin to Lanie online and we were both bored so we decided to do something. We went to Blockbuster, Hollywood Video, and then we were going to go to Rita's but the line was halfway around the building, so we went to the 7-11 across the street and got Slurpees. WARNING: DO NOT GET NACHOS W/ CHEESE AND/OR CHILI FROM 7-11, IT TASTES NASTY(especially w/ a sour watermelon slurpee. Blech.). Then later that night while i was in the MIDDLE of my shower, all the electricity goes out, so I'm standing in the shower in pitch black... not fun. Well I guess that's it... ciao! P.S. If ur one of my friends, to get all the info from my day go to <lj user=""go_climb_a_tree"" /> and then u'll know it all! Whoo!"

I spent the night there Friday night and all we did was hang out and watch tv but I had a good time. I hardly ever get to see her nemore and she's moving on the 15th of this month up to Massachusetts which sucks MAJORLY. At least I have a prom date now... technically 2, cuz I'm going with Jess and she has to bring Pierre, so hopefully we can spiff-ifye him so that he's not so boring.

His mom was so nice and she gave me a hug and said that he would want his friends to smile and that he's watching us 24/7. It's amazing how strong she is and I have the uttermost respect for her and the whole family.

I felt really touched at the end cuz Vince's(Matt's BEST friend) told me that there was a pic of Matt in the collage holding the flowers that he gave to me at the 8th grade dance.... the first time I met him. I was so excited that I was kind of included in his memories that it just made me cry a LOT harder. 

Huh, so hopefully my mom will lemme go tomorrow, and if not, then I'm gonna skip school cuz Holly really wants me there and I really wanna go. I can't believe that I'm never gonna see him again...

Holly called me last night and told my dad what happened and he called me on my cell phone. I didn't believe him when he told me because he's old and often doesn't hear things the right way. So I was still crying anyways and trying not to crash the car and I decided that I needed to confirm this horrid event. I drove over to where it happened and I saw all the signs for Matt saying ""We miss you Daggett!"" and my heart just sank. He died not even 2 minutes away from where I live so now everytime I go past it, I'm going to think of him and just start crying. It's not fair! He was taken too soon and he was the nicest guy I've ever met. 

He was my first(and only) date to a school dance and I think I'm never going to have one so he'll always have that place. The last time I hung out with him was at the ice skating rink a couple of weeks ago. Holly was trying to teach me how to skate and he was holding my other hand. I kept yelling at him not to let go, don't let go!... and he never did. There was a point in when I grabbed the wall and he went off with his friends, but he never let go...

Rest in Peace Matt, we love you and will always miss you.

Oooh, but I kinda took the wrong road there so I had to turn around and go back past the mall. I felt really retarded but at least I got there! So after that, we went back to her house to see her kitties. I had the best time trying to get her cats to get the treats outta the can thingy but only Kiki really understood... kinda. So then we came to my house to play DDR... of course and Holly got an A... a bunch of them! WHOO HOLLY!!!

Yesterday, Tori came over. :-( I guess it's better than being alone all day, and plus, I got to play her DDR which I don't have cuz it's for the PS1. (OMG, I found a Disney DDR on eBay. How hot is that? Only problem is, it's about $70. O well, I'll just keep lookin!) So I babysat last night. I have to say, those r the BEST kids ever. All they wanna do is play board games, card games, and watch movies. Can you believe that I get paid to do that? Shoot, beats stayin home.

Today was rehearsal. It actually wasn't too bad considering I didn't have to do anything for about half of the time. I ""had"" to be there around 9:30, but I didn't actually do nething until 11:30! And to think I coulda slept in another 2 hours, sheesh. I got to drive by myself today, which wasn't at all as exciting as I kinda hoped it would be, the only plus being that I could listen to my ""Queen of the Damned"" soundtrack instead of the stupid radio all the time. Well, I had my first experience with filling the car with gas... whoo. Of course for my first time, I get the stupid kind! It's the kind that doesn't have a latch on the handle, so you have to stand there and hole the lever down. I felt so stupid! Hey, at least I'm not a virgin nemore! (I mean at pumping gas, u retard...) Blaaaaahhhh...

Gahh! 2 months, 2 weeks and 1 day left until prom, and I STILL don't have someone to go with! I think I'm just gonna save my money for my dress for next year's dress and just not go. I mean, everyone's gonna have someone, and I'll be all alone... which really sucks. GUYS, I NEED MAJOR HELP W/ THIS!!!! Tell me whether u think I should go or stay home and... do whatever. Well, I'm gonna play DDR some more. Byes! (I'm not obsessed, just dedicated!!!)

P.S. I got an A doing Kick the Can on HEAVY!!! (for those of u who don't kno how hard that song is, I'll hafta show u sometime...)"

"event","Yay, no school for me today! Sometimes I really DO love my parents. So bcuz I live so far away from school, I can't get a bus there, so that means they would have to drop me off, go home, then coma back an hour later to pick me up. My dad was like, ""Man, fuck that!"" so I got to stay home! WHOO for missing French! Wow, I got my wish cuz last night on Xanga I put that I didn't wanna go to school today, and I didn't have to go! But I did make a promise w/ myself that if I stayed home, then I would actually do my homework... meh. Omg, I'm almost done the 5th book of Cirque du Freak already, and I don't think I'll be able to get to the library to order the 6th one! *gasp* What am I gonna do w/out something to read? ACK!!!! Yes, I kno. I am a freak. O well, guess I'll go finish my book then, ciao!

"event","So today was Valentine's Day(gag) and it was terrible, as usual. I didn't get nething, which didn't surprise me so I ended up getting myself 3 roses to make myself feel better, and it helped a little. I did get a Beanie Baby from Steph and choc. sweethearts that taste like cocoa, so that makes them awesome.

*sniffle* I don't think I'm gonna be able to get the dress I want cuz my mom still wants to look for a dress for prom at King of Prussia mall. I want the Arwen dress! Blach, maybe next year then...

Whoo, I finished my chem. project and it kinda looks like I'm obsessed w/ the Eagles, which is funny cuz I hate football. But newayz, it looks kinda hot, but I think I shoulda done it in red instead of green. 

Meh, I guess I should go then and just do something else. Perhaps my other homework..."

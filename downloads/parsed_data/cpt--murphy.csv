Back on Dry land.

I'm sorry to all for not being around this past (stares at onboard clock) week? In any case I'm in New York now staying at the nearest <s>Motel</s> Hotel to the Harbor (I have NO idea which one)
  Epps and the crew went out to see this new movie ""Sin City"" I'll probably see it tomorrow-so expect a review.

"event","<font size=1>Beware-Murphy's gonna get geeky. Despite all of this, boat salvaging (judging from my research) is actually really-really interesting. Then again I might just be getting as geeky as poor Murph.*smile*</font>

   Alright! Well I've got Everybody here (We've just finished dinner) To give you a little info about what we do/why we do it etc.  IF you've got any questions (or incidentally something you'd like us to salvage) then go ahead and ask.
It gets somewhat technical (Sorry about that. There's no way to really avoid it-but I'm going to try and make it as interesting as I can.

Okay.

What's the first step?
Obviously we have to-

<b>Find a boat</b>

    Because we're an independent salvage entity (We do not contract out to any corporation) We either have to be contracted out to a company that has something to salvage (A boat went down and the owners want us to bring it back up) Or we have to find ourselves in posession of a boat and <i>Declare ourselves salvor-in-posession</i> (I'll get to that) of the boat.
In the case of the first scenario-someone with something that they want us to bring up-we will usually head out to the site and get to the technical work. 

<b>Salvor-in-posession</b>

This is the exciting part.
  Under the law of the sea, if a boat sinks (or anything that sinks on the boat basically) and people forget about it (Or it sank in a time when we did not have the equiptment that we have now and they couldn't bring it back up) then the person who finds it is declared <i>Salvor-in-posession</i> of a boat.  There's a difference between the ""laws of nations"" and the ""Law of the Sea""
I'll give an example.
  We found the Dutch Schooner Het Meisje van Faire (Faire Maid) In the waters off South Africa. Records indicate that she was on her way to Cape Horn with a hull full of Georgia Cotton when she sank with all hands (*shudder* tell any seaman that and they'll shiver-I garuntee) 
  We took the boat to court to declare ourselves ""Salvor-in-posessor"" of the ship.  Land legalities mean nothing ot the sea.  the American constitution's stances on issues of admirality (If I remember correctly its in Article III) basically allow that the law of the sea shall be followed.
A Law of 200 years vs. 3,000. Go figure. 
  The South African courts along with the American Courts in Florida (Our long standing and long suffering lawyer Tim Cosling. *hats off to Tim*) 
So basically that covers that. *shrugs* The Law of the Sea simplified-Finders Keepers-loosers weepers. Anything onboard was ours to salvage-including the captain's personal...I want to say piggybank.
 The money that the Artic Warrior recieved for selling off the Het Meisje van Faire helped us buy the Artic Whale salvage tug (That much) which meant that we were able to extend our operation into the pacific.
These sorts of operations require massive hands and a single barge (We contract out to KenyaMarina Barges and split the profits down the middle) 

Most of what we do happens in the aftermath of storms and or massive acts of nature.  after Hurricane Charley we joined the massive throng of salvagers and salvage companies who worked to save the boats in the marinas. 
You can't charge for something like that.
  The usual cost is about 250 per ship (The prices are subject to negotiation if the corporation is large or if the boat itself is large) About half of the money we spend on salvaging the actual boat is used to pay for equiptment.
If you're familiar with the Antonia Graza then you'll understand the mistakes that we made (Or more accurately that I made-thank god Greer called the Coastguard)

What should we have done first?
-Declared ourselves to the coastguard as salvager in posession of the passenger liner

How many tugs would it have taken to salvage the boat? 
-we estimate about five to six (Considering our operation only has three that are specifically ours) 
<font size=2>We would have had enough money to buy at least two more if we'd actually been able to salvage the damn boat...</font>

What about all the technical mumbo-jumbo? Surely you just can't pull it off the bottom of the ocean.

No. *eyes narrow* we can't. If you'd REALLY like me to get into the technical aspects of salvaging then say so and I'll talk about diving, equiptment that we use-pumps and the like. If you have a boat with an intact hull (which never happens because in order for them to sink there HAS to be something wrong with the hull) 
  You can rig up a pump underwater and pump out the water in the hull. The boat will then float to the surface!
Isn't that cool?
Let me know if you'd like to know more. Dodge would like to take over (as would Santos/Epps/Greer and Munder *eyes narrow* I didn't want this to get out of hand) So if you've got any questions now's the time."

Starr brought ot my attention that I've announced that I've died.
That's true.

I died for exactly nine minutes. 
We were onboard the Graza. I had been trapped in the aquarium (By a Ghost-but that's a long story) 
Epps shot out the glass and I tumbled forth.
That ws about when the Coastguard picked me up.

The wonderful wizard of medicine (Peter Chase) Who was onboard used the difibrilator that the had and brought me back.
<lj-cut text=""Cut for canon"">
This is the only non-canon point my muse has addressed.
Everything else is true. 
Thank you

So to answer everyone's question-this is where I get the idea to pick a bone with death and such. Thank god for modern medicine.

"event","<i>What is so important to you that without it, life would not be worth living? Why?</i>

Epps.
Why? Because we're like-

<lj-cut text=""Father and Daughter""> 
""Come on You guys-I really think we can do this."" 
  Murphy hides a smile and catches Epps eyes at the last second so that she knows how proud he is of her. It sounds crazy, <i>It is crazy and he doesn't want to admit it</i> But they are going to tow the greatest salvage find of the century <i>That's probably cursed</i> And they're going to do it together.
     And he'll tell her, back in Anchorage-tell her how much she means to him and how much she's like the daughter he never had. It's always been mutual between them, an unspoken understanding as most parents have with their children. You matter to me, You are important, without you as my legacy my own life is made less.
  And Munder speaks and his mind is back on the problem at hand, ignoring the growing feeling in the pit of his stomach overwhelming rationality and sense.

""Hey Murph-with the gear we've got on board I can't fix our little engine problem.""
His eyes narrow, Santos-forever the dampener, the spoiler of the mood.

""Why don't you just quit your bitching and overhaul the starboard engine please?""
Santo's reply was sarcastic, ""So that's the plan eh Murph?""
Murphy's eyes narrow, forgetting the presence of others, ""Just do it.""
  He knows something's wrong. He would never be this sharp with anyone on a regular day.  But Santos had it coming damn it and the boat-the most important part of the entire venture lay still beside them...

He catches Epps staring at him confused, a child who's just seen her father for what he really is.  Murphy ignores it briskly and they get to work. But Epps is cold now, distant-
  And Santos, when Santos dies and comes back at attacks him Murphy tries to kill him and nearly succeeds until he looks down at his wounds like a lion and sees <i>Epps</i> Staring at him with frightened eyes.
""He was drunk! he didn't mean anything by it!""
Drunk? No, Damned Drunk again. Bu Epps-Epps-he nearly killed her!
<i>Without you my own life is made meaningless.</i>
   He looked up and knew that he'd lost her when he saw her standing next to Ferriman, breathing fast.
She looks down at him inside his little glass box, pleading for an answer.
Its that look that stays with him as he gives up-when he finally dies.

"event","I continuously mention Individuals in my frequent posts to this journal-And I figured that I should at least give you an introduction to said individuals so that you can see <i>Hopefully</i> a glimpse into my life <s>And It's insanity</s> 

<lj-cut text=""The Crew of the Artic Warrior"">

Greer: My first Mate and probable best friend.  Greer and I met in the Navy when I was an officer and we've hit it on and off ever since. He's a funny guy (And really sweet too, but don't tell him that *looks in Starr's direction* Or I'll <s>Kill You</s> *smile* 
  Greer tends to be the more rationale, realistic side of the command staff in the Aritc Warrior Salvage Company.  He tends to think things through more then the rest of us.  When we found the Antonia Graza he was the first one to tell us that the boat was fucked. 
I wish we'd listened to him.

Epps: Epps is...like the daughter I never had. Young, Vibrant and a bit of a hardass (she must have learned that from me) Epps is the Engineer-and-the one I'm prepping to take over the Company when I retire. She's a first class diver and a third rate cook (You do not want to see this kid in a galley. If you should-Run. Very fast.
She'll probably kill me for writing that.
  I can't tell you alot about Epps's background because...I honestly don't know.  It sounds like a Romantic Novel but she and I first met in a Bar with myself being stinking drunk.  She joined the crew as a salvager and sponsored me in the AA program. Needless to say our revenues (weather from my lack of drinking or her presence it remains to be seen) And I promoted her. I divided my share of the corporation in half and sold Epps a third of the operation. Greer wants to get out of it and I'm close to retirement. She gets the whole she-bang. 

Dodge: Dodge came to the Warrior as a young college graduate looking for a thrill.  I have no idea what inspired him to sign onto a Salvage boat (I think his dad was a salvager-but you'll have to ask him) Anyway he's highly intelligent (women find him attractive or so I've been told) but He's only got Eyes for Epps.
  Dodge likes to read (He leaves his books all over the place too *grumble*) But he doesn't want to admit it to Epps (which is the cutest thing if you ask me-but I wouldn't know *eyes narrow*) He likes to try and pretend to be the big bad Ass for her. 
But I know he'll be there for her in the end. And if he hurts her in any way <s>He'll have me to answer to</s> She'd probably kill him.

Munder: Munder and Dodge signed on together. They've been friends since Gradeschool (Despite Munder being held back a grade) But they're inseperable.  Munder may not be the brightest bulb in the box (and I mean that in the nicest way my friend) but He's a hard worker and a first class diver.  Ironically Munder signed out of the same Navy that I did (He was a Diver, I was a Sonar Technician) He likes comic books and fan-type things (along with boats-which I will never understand) And...
We convinced him to start bathing by dropping him over the side when we were docked.

Santos: Santos is the newest member of the team, the one I know the least about, and the one I have the most regrets in relation to. I'm kind of the monkey on his back (because he's so new) And I don't let him get away with alot of bullshit. He seems like a hard worker (despite everything) But he has a terminal case of what my mother called ""The Lazies"" 
His girlfriend is a car.
   I shit you not. Its a mustang. It is indeed a nice car, but to treat it with the level of respect that he seems to borders on the obsessive.
Of course...*stares at Warrior* I'm not one to talk am I?

<lj-cut text=""The Antonia Graza"">

<i>""These Italian Liner's couldn't compete for speed so they built these floating art palaces.""</i>
-Cpt Murphy GhostShip.

    The Antonia Graza was a two stack passenger liner, a quarter of the size of the Titantic but twice as opulant.  According to historians it set new standards on both the Italian and the European liners. Passengers could live in the literal lap of luxury while dedicated crewmembers saw to their every whim. Chiefs were on call at all hours of the night to prepare food in many exotic cultures.  It was literally a floating palace. 
but there's a darker side to the story.
On May 19th, 1962 the Antonia Graza receieved a fading distress call from the European Vessel ""Loreli"". She was adrift, two holes in her hull-and trapped on a sandbarge. No one survived the sinking, save one man.
  A passenger who identified himself as ""John Ferriman"" was rescued.  Ferriman claimed he knew nothing about the crates he was lying against-however when the crew of the Graza opened them they were found to be full of 
Gold bars.
Thousands of them.
  Two days later A mutiny comprised of the Galley staff and the Pursuer staff overthrew captain and officer crew.  In a rather grisly display the second engineer rigged the foreward boom cable on the aft deck to come loose-cutting sixty people in half.  Half the passengers were poisoned during the grand ball.  The rest were rounded up and herded into the luxurious pool where they were shot to death.
40 years afterward my crew enters into th story. 
</lj-cut>

Talking about all of this makes me tired...That and Epps is calling me. I'll have more history in two shakes of a lamb's tail-promise."

"event","<i>The Artic warrior was always the most dependable of boats</i>

Yet Murphy knew instinctively when he felt the deck of the Antonia Graza rock beneath his feet that something had gone horribly, horribly wrong.  Greer and Santos both were down in the water-if something should have happened-
 And then he was running,running along with Dodge to the deck just in time to see Epps jump over the side in a vain effort to save them along with Ferriman, their mysterious passenger. Their Conversation couldn't be heard beneath the waves but Murphy's heart spoke loud enough for all of them...
Sure he was loud. Sure he'd given both Greer and Santos a hard time. That was <i>who he was</i> An old sea Dog, a Bastard, someone <i>used</i> to being obeyed. Didn't he have the right to think like this? hell to act like this.
""You Dick."" Murphy stopped as Munder ran ahead. The old man dropped to the floor of the Graza and put his face in his hands,""Greer-you selfish bastard.""

Was he crying? impossible. He hadn't cried in years-ever since his wife left him and took their son. Ever since the events of his miserable childhood. 

<i>The Artic Warrior was the rightest of vessels</i>

Then Munder and Dodge came back, Epps and Ferriman hauling and unconcious Greer between them.  Epps was wet, waterlogged like a drowned cat.
Murphy's heart took a few tentative steps out of his stomache, ""Santos?""
Epps looked at him, her eyes filled with infinite sadness.

His hopeful heart retreated back into his stomach, afraid to face the truth.  Suddenly unable to face his crew he turned away from the ballroom and headed out to the bow.
   Out there the world was cool and dark and filled with nothingness, water in all directions.  He should feel proud, proud like the captain of this formerly fine vessel-
but all he felt was regret.

<i>The Artic Warrior was the brightest of Ships</i>

He pulled matches from his pocket and toyed with them between his greasy gnarled fingers before lighting one and dropping it childishly into a steel drum on the deck.  The drunk caught fire (There must have been something combustable inside) and he sat for a moment, staring into the flames.
  Was this what Santos felt? staring at fire-the enemy of water, the thing he'd built his life upon? it Licked and danced like a living beast, twisting and turning seductively like a minature of the mouth of hell.
Fire was passion, Santos had that in plenty.
Fire was Rebirth-change. It had certainly come for both him and the crew. A new moment, a dawning idea.
Fire was Life-and Santos was <i>Dead</i>

""And its my fault."" Murphy turned away from the seductive warmth and looked out to sea at the Empty nothing of the world around him-all traces of his former life slipping away...

The Artic Warrior was the best of the best.

<i>it was her captain that failed</i>"

This is Epps, Chief engineer onboard the Artic Warrior. She's been like a daughter to me,sweet, kind, caring, and compassionate. She's not nessescarily a nice girl, but to make it in our business you can't really be nice can you? All around my favorite person onboard my boat.

This is Epps (Do you see how often she's in these pictures? Not intentionally, she hates cameras) Once again onbaord my <i>And the crew's</i> favorite toy, the ""Artic Warrior."" Best Lil' Damn Tugboat in the seven seas. Would you believe I got her used? We have two others besides her, The Artic Wolf and the Artic Whale. I'm beginning to wonder if I've boxed myself into a corner in reguards to theme...

This photo-okay we were about ready to head out under contract from Shell (no, not the Exxon Valdez thing-although all of you probably remember that...(Or I'm just talking out of my ass-I'm too old *sighs*) Anyway, Greer grabbed the camera away from me and forced me into the frame (I hate getting pictures taken of myself) Epps jumped in too, willing to support my soul being stolen (I say that now <s>Who would have figured it would happen two years later?</s>) But Anyway, its just a sweet photograph.
  I've heard that Ferriman thought we were a couple for the longest time (For the love of-Eeew. Obviously the boy's not right in the head) But no-to answer questions-we're not. Would you sleep with your own kid? I don't think so. 
Epps is practically a member of my family anyway-so it doesn't really matter when it comes down to it.

<lj-cut text=""Rated for Horror"">
Her name had been Alice.
  A good Irish Catholic Girl, long red hair and bright sparkling green eyes that any man (and many a man) would drown in willingly.  She'd been his for a fortnight, two weeks of bliss that Murphy was unlikely to forget-or forgive her for.
She'd come to him willingly, excited.  He was the loner, the shy boy-it would be good for them to do this together-she'd help him-yes she would.
  And he'd come to her in wonder, wonder at her perfect breasts, her perfect physique, her flawless creamy white skin that ran up and down her thighs and across her back as she arched like a cat in heat yowling when they both reached their climax. Then she'd kissed him-their only kiss during this deep soul act-it was a true kiss-as the movie Princess Bride would say two years after the fact, ""One of the Five Kisses rated the most passionate-and the most pure.""He'd left himself there, inside her, savoring the feeling of knowing a woman so intimately they'd be connected on some level forever. 
Then she'd left him.
<i>And so you forgot her.</i> Ferriman's voice, Ferriman's cruel and mocking voice in Murphy's head-ripping through his thoughts, playing with his new toy.
  Murphy closed his eyes, ""That's right.""
<i>Until you saw her obituary</i>
     One week after their defining moment, they were back in their places in the universe.  She the popular girl, the cheerleader, she with the new boyfriend the jock.  He the nerd, the wannabe Marine biologist, the ocean nut.
Then she'd jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge.
   She'd written him a stack of letters.  Letters which were handed off to the police and then to him, beginning him to notice her, to say something-to acknowledge what they'd shared.  Then the letters grew dark..
And Murphy remembered the night a week before her death when she'd called him.  Beginning him to go to the Doctor with her.  She was pregnant. 
He didn't believe her.  It was a prank, yet another abusive prank. Or she'd been impregnanted by her boyfriend-her new boyfriend.
  His father was a police officer-he'd forced his own son to submit his DNA for a paternity test-something still so new it was unexact. 
In every case but his.
Her name had been Alice and she had killed herself after he'd turned her away from him, carrying his child.
He had been 17 at the time.
17 and old enough to pass for 18 when he'd run off to join the Navy. A streak of blinding pain up one arm brought him back to reality. 
Ferriman smirked. <i>There's your sin. </i> He held up Murphy's marked hand, <i>Neglect of someone who loved you.</i>

"event","so I've FINALLY got the computer (Away from Santos-I just <i>know</i> he's pirating music) And I figured for lack of something better to do I'll just answer a few questions.
These livejournals are addictive aren't they?

In any case..

<i>Have you ever regretted a wish you made? Why/what happened?</i>

I wished for riches and fame to come from salvaging.
   I wished for the biggest find to come along this century, something that would turn all the heads in all the right places and put us <i>doubly</i> on the map. I wished (a small part of me did at least) That I could find something so incredible that I'd be remembered by humanity for at least a decade.  I wished for enough funds so that I could finally retire, become one of those old sea-side hermits living in a nice new england town, maybe finally settle down again-raise a family. I wished for adventure and glory and recognition above all else. 
I got my wish.
I wish I hadn't. 

<i>What can you say is truly yours?</i>
I split the operation in half about...*thinks* two to five years ago? Its owned three ways between Greer, Epps, and Myself.  We operate three different tugs in three different parts of the world-Artic Warrior included..
My CDs? No-<s>Everybody</s> Borrows my CDs. I wish they wouldn't. Munder leaves them scratched. >_< Fucker.
When you live on a boat I guess nothing belongs to you.
  Oh! Yes My scarf. It's not particularly interesting mind you-but It is most DEFINATELY mine.  My first wife <s>Lover</s> Gave it to me for a birthday present. It's always brought me some sort of luck. 
For instance! We were out in the strait (This was before I invested in the Salvage company-back when I was still in the Navy) And we hit some sort of ""jutting rock"" as the first mate put it.  We were little more then a PT boat (Don't ask why a US Navy PT boat would be out there-I have no idea-I think we were making for Greenland) In any case we were stuck until the Captain told me to go down and see how bad the damage was.
I had on my scarf-I went down-and discovered it was only a little tear.
We were able to repair it quickly and push off-limping all the way to Greenland (Yeah-it was Greenland)
Conidence? 
Probably
But It's still nice to think it brought me luck."

"event","<i>If you could change one person's mind about something, who and what would it be?</i>
(Question 2 cut for SPOILERS)

Wow-they really pull no punches on the first questions do they?
<lj-cut text=""Let me be perfectly frank"">
      When you're in a leadership position, your crew looks up to you and expects that you'll know what to do in any given situation-from the stove being lit onfire to being trapped on a boat with a bunch of undead ghosts. 
Seriously.
    I'd change the crew's mind about the gold that we'd found onboard.  What-you don't think we'd found treasure before? Treasure chests are a fuckin' dime a dozen at the bottom of the ocean, everybody and their brother's probably lost one. I was more concerned about the ship and how much that would be worth-to finally prove that one of those old sea tales I'd been hearing since I was a kid was actually real...
But enough about that. 
It still kind of hurts.
    You wanted a precise answer though-and I aim to give you one at least.  The biggest mistake I've ever made in my career as a salvager, the biggest threat, the biggest danger to my life-I'd want to stop. 
If I had to be totally correct I'd say that I'd like to go back and change <I>My mind</i> About going after Jack Ferriman's ""Big Find"" 
</lj-cut>

<i>What is the scariest thing that has ever happened to you?</i>

<lj-cut text=""That's easy."">
Oh that's really simplistic. 
Waking up out of a haze-listening to some unknown tune and suddenly realizing that the top of my new little box-like home onboard was <i>leaking water</i>
Slowly.
Torturing me.

Ever been alone? Really truly alone? knowing that no-one will hear you if you scream-no matter how hard you pound on the glass and shout and beg and cry the water's still coming, going up to your knees-now you're treading-now you're at the top fighting for breath. 
There's a sudden blissful moment of acceptance-but it doesn't last. 

Death is slow.
Especially death by drowning.
</lj-cut>

<i>What in your life are you most dissatisfied with and why?</i>

Jesus Christ-um...
Before or after death? *Just a little humor there*
  I think <s>before death</s> I was most dissatisfied with Santos.  It's not that I didn't appreciate his work ethic or anything-you've got to believe me on that.
However He kept bitching and whining and bitching and-
   Okay so <s>Maybe I was a little stressed out</s> But it was the biggest find of my career! What was I supposed to do-let him sit on his ass all day and stare at that stupid picture of his car? I wonder what his girlfriend thought-and always playing his music so-damn-loud..."

"event","This week was interesting..ish..I suppose. Went to see Mama Mia on Sunday with Mango, Asparagus, and..Jennifer. Must find food name for her..hm..maybe I should rename her Jamba Juice or..Jello. I dunno, but yeah, went to see that and it was OMG. Some good OMG but some really bad OMG, like when that..dude who used to play James Bond, whatever his name was; well, he started singing and it wasn't good singing either. He can sing, sorta, but I don't think singing really fits his persona. It was just strange and hilarious. Especially the end where we get to see the clothing from the 70s and it was...colorful. Nothing else to say about that matter. Then we went to eat at Bubba Gump and I got this cool cup that blinks worse than a rave. It's probably a cup they would use in one. 

<lj-cut text=""Continuing on"">

Monday was horrible because it was cold and windy as hell but I had to go and take a Chem prep course at San Jose State. Pretty much wake up at 6:30, leave house by 7, walk to the Caltrain station in 20 minutes, and sleep on the train for an hour until I get to San Jose. Then get on a bus and finally get there so I can sit through a two hour lecture and another 2 hour ""hands on"" thing where we work on problems. Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The teacher, Dr. Singmaster was surprisingly interesting. Especially when talking about the professors. 

Singmaster: ""There was this one professor that all the students hated and for the longest time I couldn't figure out why. So finally one day I actually talk to the man and he was the sweetest guy in the world. So it was strange. It was like one day out of the blue, pop, he changed....He's been like that for ten years and suddenly he's the greatest guy ever....Well, I found out later that was because.....he got a divorce. ::starts cracking up::

Yesterday she talked about dry ice. 

Singmaster: ::throws dry ice into beaker of water:: ""See, this is what all those mad scientist movies are about. And if you want to make it REALLY interesting! ::pours food coloring into beaker:: Now let's see what happens with soap! ::pours soap in and whole concoction starts making large bubble tube that slowly rises until it falls over::

Student: ""Now how long will it take for it to finish bubbling?""

Singmaster: ""Eh, it's almost dead. You can hear it crackling it's last dying breath already.""

Today, she demonstrated the wonders of liquid nitrogen.

Singmaster: ::sticks flower into liquid nitrogen:: ""Now liquid nitrogen..blah blah blah blah..."" ::flower falls off stem:: ""OOP! Oh well, I have ten more of these; let's try again.""

Of course, she then dumps the whole container on the floor and the whole first row flinches and pulls their feet up. The interesting thing was that it was the best floor cleaner in the world because you could see it pulling all the dirt on the floor into this one little neat pile. So awesome.

"event","Yay, update.

Went to orientation on Thursday and Friday and let me tell you, it was borderline insane. There were good parts, mostly from the people I met; but that's it. Let's start my schedule, shall we?

<lj-cut text=""Here's what happened"">

Day 1

Wake up at 6:30 realizing I forgot to pack up things and so begins the race against time to fit every little thing possible into a gym bag. (btw, I still forgot an extra pillow; but we can't have everything can we?)

Get out the door by 7:15 into the car for an hour long drive while trying to apply on sunscreen that smelled really .

Try to get dad to go home and stop worrying that we were too early. In fact, by the time I got to the place we were supposed to meet; the line already started forming. 

Wait for 45 minutes while talking to the person in front of me who turned out to be my roommate for the night. 

Do stuff like break up into groups and talk and ""bond"" while taking this four page survey which was the weirdest thing ever asking things like ""Are you a Liberal or a Conservative?"" and ""How popular are you?"" LOL, that was funny. 

Go into the music hall to talk about how our life will be a journey and I promptly fell asleep because it was boring and there was air conditioning. 

::Skipping things that I can't remember::

Meet our...I want to say advisor (advisor or adviser? how do you spell this?) but I'm not sure...yeah..whatever..ANYWAYS, his name was Micheal and he was seriously the funniest person ever. His first sentence with us was ""Black people are SENSITIVE!"" I was laughing so hard because of that...

Random Conversation:

Random guy: What happens if you fail the MPE?
Micheal: ::very seriously:: Then we'll kick you out.
Random guy: ::stares::

I was really trying not to laugh at him but it was hard. Later when we talked, we had the single weirdest conversation that started with class scheduling to how girls are jealous of his figure to how his driver's license was first sent to him saying he was a female to Breathing 101...do not exhaust yourself by breathing too much, you should only breathe deeply twice a day. And that was in the span of...like...twenty minutes. In the end, I realize that I forgot to ask him for his name...even tho I saw his license, but it wasn't like I would really focus on the name. (This actually happened on Day 2 but who says I have to go in order?)

I was at those booths that introduce you to things like Housing and shit and my GOD I was hungry. So, I'm talking to the secretary dude of the Vice president and I got some candy out of him but it was then that they announced that the lunch was going to close soon and I was seriously like...""Are you SERIOUS?! They started lunch and they didn't even TELL me?!?!"" Secretary dude laughed at me and I rushed to get food before they closed.

Lunch was...really kinda gross. It was orange chicken with boiled broccoli and rice. The chicken was ok but the rice was almost...crunchy. It was pretty much white people's rice. Even though I was hungry, I filled up on soda; how healthy.

::Again skipping around cause..yeah

Dinner was actually not that bad. I sat with two people from my group along with a girl and her boyfriend who were majoring in Forensic science..oh yeah, and a parent. The other two people's names were Ashley who changed her major from dance to psychology and Nolan who is majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Nolan really reminded me of Mike yet not. He had his sarcasm and slight antisocialness but BOY could he talk. He seriously could not stop talking and he carried around a tennis racket. Ashley was actually staying right across from me for orientation and also an anime and video game player/addict. I stuck with them for the rest of the night.

We went to their event center to play and just ""mingle"" at..nine or so and I ended up playing Wallyball with ten or so other ppl. Seriously it was sooo fun! Also, it was fun to trash talk with one of the dudes on the other team cause later on, he spiked the ball at the girl next to me and would not stop apologizing. HAHA. 

Took short shower and camped out in Ashley's room cause Joy, my roommate, wanted to turn in early. Then returned to my room cause we have to shut the door at like..midnight and found out that Joy didn't fall asleep yet. So, we talked about her family and how she has this cute little puppy who's half chihuahua and half something else. 

Tried to fall asleep but ended up rolling around for the rest of the night cause A) It was hot and stuffy...B)The bed was creaky and uncomfortable and C) People were outside our window and were HECKA loud. 

Day 2

Woke up at 6:30 and woke Joy up too.

Packed up everything and stuff all the sheets into the pillowcase and left it outside the door.

Go outside to a long ass line to return our key while filling ANOTHER survey. (It actually wanted us to rate Day 2 which didn't even happen yet.)

Eat breakfast which by far was the best meal out of the others that I had. 

Sign up for classes

Walk around the bookstore with Sarah and Jamila, two more ppl I met. 

Pay for orientation and leave. (Dad was there quicker than I expected)

</lj-cut text>

So yeah...Longest post I've written for a while. Aren't you proud? There was probably more but too lazy to add."

"event","hello all from Canada where right now, I am bored out of my mind. Who knew even cable TV can get meticulous after a whole freakin' week. anyways, i'm returning to California tomorrow, well technically i'm getting on a plane tomorrow night and i'll be back thursday morn. watch, i'll probably be bored through my skull when i get back too. lol. so yes, just a very short update today cause the boredom has now contributed into my laziness and now TV looks slightly inviting. My cousins are evil...they'll be the death of me. 




OH!! Btw, I got a Wii. ::does little dance:: but it was insanely expensive if you include like..games and other controllers. I dunno."

"event","Hello all who notice that I'm finally updating after...25 weeks, I've risen from the dead, again. Yesterday was somewhat interesting seeing as I spent two and a half hours in a car with my mother, father, and aunt driving to UC Merced. Of course when you're going on a road trip to go to a college, here are the most popular topics to talk about:


1. the college you're visiting right now
2. the colleges you didn't get into
3. the people who DID get into the colleges you didn't get into 
4. the college majors
5. the college majors YOU chose
6. why the college majors you chose SUCK
7. why the college majors you chose are GOOD (that was about a ten minute conversation)
8. what college majors you SHOULD HAVE chosen
9. FOOD (cause by the time you get there, you're hungry)


so after 2 1/2 hours of hell and listening to the GPS say, ""continue on your current route for ___ miles...turn right, turn left, you are at your destination..."" we find out that asians are notorious for being early; for us, an hour early. but I noticed something as we were driving closer and closer to the city of Merced, there's nothing there. I'm serious, there is nothing there but land, land, maybe some water, an occasional and cows; which brings up the funny little event called ""cow tipping"". As Mango had so graciously told me, Merced is nothing but a hot place that participates an event known as ""cow tipping"" where drunk bastards who have nothing better to do go and tip cows over for fun because seriously, there is nothing there to do. At least not for another 10-15 minutes by car where there's an extremely small amount of stores and a gas station. Yay! 

The good thing is that everything there is new considering it's about...3 or so years old and the housing I would get this fall is going to be brand new. Also having random rabbits and other wildlife doesn't hurt, I got to see one and I sat there watching the rabbit until I started to annoy my mother, who is now convinced that I'm weird for sitting in the middle of the walkway to stare at a rabbit eating grass. If I had a camera, I would have taken a pic; I didn't so that sux for you. The food looks yummy tho and the guide person was pretty good, even if she had the tendency to walk backwards and step and trip of random trees and poles. Kinda like me in a way, considering she was also aiming for a biological science major. The other ppl in our group included: korean guy with a baseball cap, his dad and an undeclared major and a latino girl with her whole family and aiming for psychology major. I'm happy about all the places you could study in, but the library was TINY!! So disappointing. As we were going home, I fell asleep so I have no idea what my mother and aunt were talking about considering father hardly inputs anything into these conversations. I suppose they would probably talk about:


1. how small the school was (seriously it was)
2. how SAFE the school might be (cause there's no way we could do anything there, like go on drinking binges or visit clubs, lolx)
3. how bored out of my mind I might be (I hope they talked about that unless they want me to be stuck in the exercise places or the clubs)
4. how that was a waste of 2 1/2 hours (again, something I hope they talked about)
5. how would I know?


By the time we got gas and drove all the way back, we went back home and feasted on ramen and soda! YAY! No, just joking. Grandma made us lotsa food and we got cake to celebrate the my aunt's birthday as well as mine. Clean up, wash dishes, yadda yadda yadda, we get home and we shower and go to sleep. Yes, that was my exciting Saturday.

sidenote: I will be legal in three days, woot!"

"event","HELLO WORLD!! I have arisen from the dead and am breaking my hiatus on lj after..uh...many months!! >.< yes, lotsa ppl, mainly mango-chan will now be unleash their wrath upon me by spamming my comments about how i'm a lazy ass and blah blah blah...

anyways, last thursday i think...was it thursday or maybe wednesday? hmmmm....anyways, last week, we had our supposed to be junior but now senior rope's course retreat. YAY! it was really fun if you consider walking 12 feet across a one inch rope that was many MANY feet high fun. actually it was quite fun though it really hurt my arms the day after. afterwards, we went over to the other side of the park and we ate lunch. we had the guy with the strange purple shirt direct us to do ""trust activities"" for the remainder of the time. oh yes, we saw a HUGE spider after tripping down a hill blindfolded. the view at the bottom of that hill was pretty, it was the golden gate bridge and the weather made it look really nice. oh yes, the blue angels were practicing over us while we were eating lunch; very exciting indeed.

Saturday was hell...i'm serious, pure hell. SATs are the evil of the earth. whoever invented them suck. i wasn't able to leave until one..ish. now i'm paranoid about my scores and it doesn't help that my mother is pushing me to discuss colleges and how her ""baby girl"" is leaving her. awpoerjewlkf;aersjglkrejsf on the upside, our proctor/teacher person who watches us so we don't cheat was rather cute. ::grins::"

"event","yay, happy thanksgiving to everybody! ::gobble gobble:: let's review:

woke up....sadly enough after mother woke me up with a frying pan.
defrosted turkey leaves the refrigerator. (hallelujah! finally my fridge is empty enough so that my lunch can go in it instead of the freezer)
laundry... my yard looks like a laundromat.
we go to my aunt's house at 1:00ish to start preparing food. 
50 other ppl come. (we had a lotta ppl sitting on the floor around the big tv watching football. i was one of them)

the turkey was dry, the mashed potatoes were burnt to the extent that even butter and milk could not save them, cranberry sauce and gravy are turkey's best friend, and a bottle or two of wine is nonexistent after ten minutes with my uncle. the carrots were a hit with the young and toothless though, they were so soft that they melded into a large lump of orange after it was drained. one of my cousins could not wait for the food and mistook my arm as a leg of turkey, apparently it must have tasted like one too because he didn't let go. let it be known that it was a boy cousin, obviously and he had teeth. my pie ended up in the face of a rival three seconds after i received it, ah well, don't like pumpkin anyways. we had to cook more food because there were too many ppl...or some ate way more than others. 

didn't i just have a lovely thanksgiving or what?"

<lj-cut text=""Mango says... Chiyo says... Mango says... Chiyo says... shut up. XD"">

Mango says she's going bald. XD

Mango is also tampering with my hair. 

Doesn't Mango always do that? (and why is Mango talking in third person?)

Chiyo doesn't know. (hands hairties to Mango.)Mango says she needs to learn how to french braid. this is an odd conversation. 

Mango says your hair is layered and it annoys her.

Chiyo asked the hairdresser especially to do that so Mango couldn't tamper with her hair.

Mango says that Chiyo is evil and will konk her on the head.

Chiyo knows she is evil, ::smirk:: she likes being evil. she's getting hit on the head, and it hurts.

Mango is going to start ball throwing at Chiyo. *can't find ball* ahh this water bottle will work fine.

::bonk::

Chiyo thinks that the water did not deserve that treatment.

Mango asks if she should give you the ASL treatment....

Chiyo contemplates on idea. She says no.

AWW. Mango says she should write her college essay on Chiyo.

Chiyo says no. She suggests Harry Potter.

Mango doesn't want to sound like a 6 year old kid.... Mango wants to write about her best friend Chiyo-chan.

::stares:: Chiyo thinks Mango should get another subject and actually work on it instead of talking about it. 

Chiyo will now update weird conversation in third person.

"event","Germany won against Portugal for the honor of 3rd place in a sad game of 3-1. They scored on Portugal twice in a short amount of time at some point of the game. 

also, Italy won the game causing massive outbreaks of drunken behaviors and spazzing all around the world for italians. the italian part of chinatown broke out in cheer and a lotta waving of italians flags. i saw lots of ppl spray-painted in green, white and red. i wonder what god would say about this impressive...uh...show of nationalism?"

<lj-cut text=""sunday"">
sunday:

went to see tim's musical play thing and MEGAN made me laugh at the most insignifigant things...like how his shirt and pants didn't match and how he was freakin' noticable b/c he was the tallest one there and how he was pushing a coat rack thing for a portion of the play etc....HE DIDN'T RECOGONIZE ME OMFG...i literally died cracking up when he finally realized i was standing right next to him talking...

tim: where are you?
me: in the theatre.
::walks out theatre w/ mango::
mango: isn't that him ::points at tall dude::
me: yes.
::cell phone rings:: (take note that he is standing right beside me)
me: ::picks up cell phone:: HELLO!!!!!
tim: WHOA! 

he doesn't recogonize me, i'm thinking...is that pathetic or did i change that freakin' much? since i came early, i purchased tickets and i left him to go refund his tickets which he had helped us buy. he tried to convince me to get more friends so they could use them instead of refunding them which is why i called you up on sunday athina. we watched the musical which consisted mostly of my former pastor dude singing and preaching. (so that's why this program is so long) btw, he can't sing soprano very well so i had to take the booklet thing provided to muffle out my laughing. there was a buffet thing after and etc.

aside from that, catherine has been released from quarrantine and i'm so happy to see her again. um, megan saw the HP&GOF and her new phrase is the continual repetition of Daniel Radcliffe and Tom Felton's names. Maria seems to have a new joy in glazing and drawing Nick on a <s>pot</s> cylinder and i just laughed randomly with aya about something that made no sense whatsoever. i've gone insane."

a)i don't feel like it, i'm lazy...
b)the only halloween costume i DO own was not bought for the spirit of halloween, it was for a project in school. i was supposed to dress up as sacagawea and do an oral report about her. (for all those laughing now, i shall cave your face in like no tomorrow...especially you canada..)
c)the damn thing is too short and....short...it's winter for god's sake, i don't need to be even more sick, unless that's what you want.

"event","today was the sophmore retreat which...fairly disappointed me. let me rephrase that, it was STUPID!! i felt like i was repeating kindergarten. yesterday was fun though. mango, athina, and i walked all the way to long's and bought junk food (which by the way, you owe me money mango cause you took most of it). by the time we got back to the bottom of the mountain, we purchased and chugged a 2 liter bottle of mountain dew. then we got to play with the doggie in the labyrith afterwards. aya, maka, and ashley seemed to have a lot of fun though. they abducted a shopping cart and started pushing each other around. i think they shoulda gotten a bigger one though. hella funny. the cough drops are rebelling against me, i think i need to get something for my throat, i'm starting to hack worse than an old lady."

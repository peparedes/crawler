"event","Yay so I finally got to have Mojito night with Kat last night.  We finally figured out that we hadn't seen each other for probably five months, which seemed *impossible* and sad, but true.  So naturally we had a lot to catch up on.

I broke my rule and drank four mojitos instead of my usual allowed three.  Typically after my third I'm pinballing off the walls, strangely enough I was fine with four last night.  Hum makes me wonder if somehow we used to make them more potent.  I doubt that we still used almost the whole bottle of rum between the two of us.  

We wound up staying up until at least 6:30 this morning, which was painful because I had to be at work this morning at 9.  I did it and am fine though.. a little kooky, but fine.

I also drunk emailed, but under supervision.. granted the supervision had also been drinking but that's okay - I was drunk emailed to first I was merely drunkenly replying.  Does that make it reasonable though?  I suppose I'll find out.  Besides apparently I'm terribly adorable and irreistable when I'm drunk - even sick drunk passed out on the bathroom floor somewhere.  Guys just seem to go crazy for me... wow what does that say?  I'm either picking up all the wrong guys or I'm entirely too tightly wound.. surely it's not the latter.. must be the former ;)  Much more believeable.

Sooo anyway - went to Bojangle's this morning to get breakfast for the girls at work, Kacie went with.  Went through the drive-thru which wasn't a particularly great idea seeing as we had a bit of a large order but hey we're lazy and tired why would we want to park and WALK in? geez.. So anyway, I place our huge-normous order and the girls says ""Okay qfoeijaiewuyr?""  Oh.  Um ""I'm sorry what?""  ""woeimfroihwernjk?""  I still have no clue and hating to say what again I finally just go ""uh um.. yeah I'm sorry I have no clue what you just said but I don't want anything else"".  Magically after that she was clear as day over the speaker.  I immediately thought of Dane Cook - sfoiwjmo pickles.. and plkwjeofj pickles and special sauce.. lots of pickles.. and special sauce.  

So long story, to say - Mojito night was again a wonderful lovely good time.  

Ba dadda da da da dah MOJITOS!"

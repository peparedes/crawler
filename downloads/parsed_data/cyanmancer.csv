"event","to say that my mother and i had an acrimonious relationship would be to engage in reckless understatement. she was my nemesis, my oppressor, my abuser, and also, what gave me life. a dickensian mix, to be sure.

in late december of 1999 she began what would be her final illness, from a flu virus that in all likelihood i gave her. i found out after she died that she was less than six months from the same fate due to several different maladies, but it was my flu that finally got her. 

she always said that i would be the death of her, i'm pleased, for her sake, she was correct. she did love to be right at my expense.

easter always makes me think of her because for some reason she loved it so much. i know not why, as we were not particularly religious. one of those life's mysteries, i suppose.

it was 5 january when they called.

'she's not responding, we think it's close.'

i went down to the hospital and sat with her, really the only person left in the world that would do so, and even i didn't know why i was there. she had burned bridges with every other human being close to her, me included, but i felt a sense of duty. she brought me into this world, i would see her out of it.

she had been unconscious since 28 december, our last conversation, which was meaningless, having taken place the day before that. there wouldn't really be anything to say anyway. no apology could make up for what she'd done to me, no acceptance of such would be believed. so it was probably best we were in this state anyway. she held on through the night and left to the next life at 4:22 am on 6 january 2000. the sirens sounded, beeps stopped, people rushed in to help, but it was for naught, we all knew what the eventual outcome would be.

as this was happening i turned to the window and looked outside to the fog. in the reflection i could see all that was going on, but didn't care. a line from a song kept running through my head...

""it's over now. i'm cold. alone. i'm just a person on my own. nothing means a thing to me. nothing, means a thing to me.""

i walked from the hospital. it was a cold, misty night with clouds at ground level. the salt-ridden pacific air filled my lungs. i drove around for a while, eventually arriving at the beach, which was about 12 blocks from the hospital, and parked the car. walking through the sand in the gathering dawn i took place on the highest dune i could find. 

i sat there for a long time. the sun was beginning to rise, casting the world into a grey light from the constant clouds that plague that little island. 

she was gone.

i was free.

i miss her, sometimes, more for what she could have represented to me than what she actually was. as i write this, her earthly remains are above me on a bookcase in my living room, in an odd way, watching over me. i don't know what to do with them, so there they sit, year after year. perhaps that is the greatest victory of all.

in my belief system she's about 8 years old now in a new life. i hope she learned from the last one. 

i know i did."

"event","As I grow older, I think, well at least I hope, I grow wiser. The adage that you learn something new every day is trite, but still very true.

I am an avid animal lover, as those of you who know me well, which in this venue I would like to think is most of you, know. I have four cats under my care currently. Yes, I said ""under my care"". What does that mean, I hear you ask. Why did you say that? Why did you put it that way?

I don't own these animals. I can't own them, they are not property. They are living, sentient beings in my care. I feed them, give them shelter and love them. In return, they give me love (some more so than others, but that's just how cats are) and make me happy. Not one day goes by that I don't look at one of them and smile, or feel a little ping of love in my chest when I pet them. They bring me immense joy. I am enriched by their presence both in my house and in my life. Not a week goes by that I don't say to one of them ""I am so glad to know you"", (and no, they don't answer). 

So, it has always puzzled me, when I go to the vet, or have some other interaction that involves them somehow, when people say ""are you their owner?"". No. Of course not. How can I own them? The idea seems ludicrous and backwards to me, akin to my owning a person.

This philosophy has now been expanded for me thanks to a book I read yesterday called Ishmael given to me by a friend who was touched by it as well.

What right do I have to the earth? Do I own this land my house sits on? Do I own the orange tree that is towering over me as I write this? Do I own the birds in that tree? What cosmic right has been given to me, just another mammal, to take ownership over these things?

I no more own the land this structure (that will be gone in 100 years at most) sits on than I could own the air that surrounds it, or the tree growing by it, or...my cats.

It seems so obvious to me now, but yesterday, I hadn't ever considered it. I am not the end of my species' evolutionary path. The earth was not created for the use (and plundering) of homo sapiens sapiens any more than it was created for the rock doves chiriping on my porch or my little girl kitten chirping back at them.

This is dangerously close to a ""spaceship earth"" kind of tirade, I realize. However, now I feel that perhaps that argument is closer to the truth than not.

We are at a pivotal time in both our history as a civilization and as a species. This place, this planet, was not created for us by some magical sky wizard in 144 hours about 5,800 years ago for our use. We are not the pinnacle of evolution who can do what we want with this place. We are not here to be the conclusion of growth on this world, but we may end up causing it.

Just as it is my responsibility to feed, care for and be a guardian to the animals in my care, it is our responsibility to feed, care for and be guardians to this world that we call home.

That is what I learned today."

Being born on the 21st day of the month (3 energy) is likely to add a good bit of vitality to your life. 

The energy of 3 allows you bounce back rapidly from setbacks, physical or mental. 

There is a restlessness in your nature, but you seem to be able to portray an easygoing, ""couldn't care less"" attitude.



You have a natural ability to express yourself in public, and you always make a very good impression. 

Good with words, you excel in writing, speaking, and possibly singing. 

You are energetic and always a good conversationalist. 



You have a keen imagination, but you tend to scatter your energies and become involved with too may superficial matters. 

Your mind is practical and rational despite this tendency to jump about. 

You are affectionate and loving, but very sensitive. 

You are subject to rapid ups and downs.</td>

Key ish being upset. :(
Not just due to the fact that Jen has just gone home after a week of being here. 
Which went way too fast, Did not seem like a week at all. 
But also to the fact that yesterday. At 3:45PM. My parents came home from the vets.
Without my 18 year old Jack Russell.
Who now lays to rest. my Poor dog. :'(

I'll miss you Waggie.
(Say anything about the name and i'll personally kill you.)

I gots me a car.. Yes, A car. Hurrah =P
It's a er.. Gurls car!
Hehe, Got me a Peugeot 206 1.4Ltr Quicksilver. (Limited sports edition type thingie)
it has, er... Alloy Boy Racer pedals!
A CD player, Air Con, Leather steering wheel & Gear stick, and some kickass sport type seats that slide down, and back.
Central locking, Power Steering... Alarm and Immoboliser, None of you bastards are taking my car. =P
It's a 3Door one, so if I want more people, have to move setas forward. But I won't be putting alot of people in anyways.
Oh, and it's silver... so once everything is done, i'll be saving money to get things done to it, First things first, i'll probably make it black... I likes black. =D
Thought it does tend to show the dirt and scratches, etc. =/

Once upon a time, There was a young lad.
This young lad's name was Kearon.
He used to be so happy knowing he was going out with the most beautiful girl in the world.
Now poor old Kearon is sad, This beautiful girl and he had fallin' out with each other over stupids reasons.
One day, Kearon wishes to be happy again, ""But is this possible?"" He asks himself..
""Only time will tell"" says a voice in his head.
Kearon then decides it's time to go to bed and rest his poor eyes, Which are Swollen with the hurt of acid tears.
He lays there... Holding a picture frame, with pictures inside, A collection of pictures of this beautiful girl that she had made him for a present..
Thinking to himself... ""Why does my heart hurt so?"", As he clenches his chest..
The moral of this story is, Kearon feels sorry for himself.

Hello!
Not updated in a Veeeery long time, Suppose that's mainly because I just haven't had the time.
I've been working for nearly 7 months now. Which was only meant to be for 2 months, But it gets me some money i guess.
Been playing FFXI On-line alot latly too. Not too good at it, But meh, Games are meant for playing, and be playing I shall!
Not done exactly alot since I last updated really, My life's just... Not very interesting. AT all. =D
Although I do keep upgrading my computer and buying alot of things. >_<
I went to Jens for two weeks around just under a month ago, Lovely time, As always.
We went to the Zooooooooooo!
Which was fun, Long bus trip there, but we survived. =D
Erms....
Anyhoo, As you can see, Not exactly very interesting, So i'll be shooting off nows.
Ciao!

"event","I'm so fuckin' fed up of being so fuckin' depressed all the fuckin' time.

I want my life back to how it used be.

I miss smiling (and meaning it).

I miss laughing.

I miss my Dad.

I miss just messing about doing nothing with my friends.

I miss my friends.

And I miss being with Key 24/7. 

I'm sorry Key. For everything. I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up losing you soon aswell.

I hate hiding how I'm feeling all the time, I just wanna pour it all out and hope it never gets back inside me again.

I don't even know what starts it off, thats whats gets to me most, I just end up taking it out on Key all the time, which is why I always feel like I'm pushing him away. I hope I never lose him, he's all I've got to keep going for now, thinking about the future I want with him and everything. i just hope my fuckin stupidity doesn't stand in the way, cos that would sure give me another reason to hate myself. ^_^

I guess I just get scared of losing him. I can't see myself ever being with anyone else, I know people always say that when they're with someone but I honestly can't. He's been so amazing through everything, especially lately when I've been such a bitch towards him for no reason. He's stood by me through a helluva lot of shit, and he's still as amazing and perfect as ever. I really do feel lucky when I'm with him, and that makes me the happiest girl in the world, but then it comes to coming home and I lose all the happiness and all the negative things come flying at me. 

Was thinking about Dad the other night, and how much I've changed since he died. And how much he's missed out on so much stuff that he wanted to see me do/achieve. He never met Key and I don't think he ever realised how truly in love I was with him. He never saw me get a job that he always dreamed I'd get, he never saw me grow up to be how I am now. I know it's only 2 years, but they've been quite an important two years and it still seems like a long time.  I just hope he's proud of what I've become, and ignores the bad points of me, like dads should do =D

Anyways, got alot of other things to say but keep them to myself I think. Babbled on enough, so I'm sorry.

I'll round of with saying: Key, you are amazing. You never cease to amaze me how much you put up with and still end up loving me just as much (I hope!) So thank you for being strong when I can't be. You're truly my best friend in the whole world. I Love You x"

Firstly, Going to see Key soon =DDDD

Wish I could be with him for Christmas, but I'm gonna be there for New Years Eve which will be even better, cos I can kiss him at midnight ;) Teehee. I miss him so much, been without him for a little over a month now and it's so hard >_< Ahwells, one day we'll be together and I can't wait =D
We're meant to be seeing Jamie when I go up, but apparently he can't be bothered, so we'll see =P  

I gots 10 presents for Key. Teehee =D All quite ickle but some of them are cool. Hehe =D

Ahwells, today was quite good in a way. Had a Performance Management Interview at work (the Primary School) and they said that I'd imroved so much already from when I started in July, and they were thrilled I was on the team =D They also said that everyone who'd been in the classroom to observe us while we were working with the children had commented on my work =D ::proud:: 

I was just telling mum this, and I burst into tears. When she said how prooud she was of me, I just couldn't help thinking that I wanted dad back with us so he could be proud of me aswell. He always believed that this is what I'd end up doing, and I really wanted him to see me achieve it. I didn't even have a job (other than the pub) when he died. But I guess thats life for you, I guess in a way he's watching me now, in some kinda corny way at least. hehe. 

Guess 'cos it's coming up to Christmas I'm thinking of him more, although this christmas is slightly easier than last years, being the second without him. Although I haven't got to the actual day yet. o.o

I've been in such weird moods lately though, really annoying myself. I'm better now, but it's been like the last couple of weeks I've been Mrs Moody Bitch, for no reason. ^_^ Think it might have been partly cos I've been ill, and partly cos I really miss Key and hate having to be apart from him all the time. It's cos we got used to spending so much time together over the summer I guess. =D 

::cuddles Key::
Fankoo babe, I can't wait til New Years - starting 2004 with you will make it the best year ever =) 
I Love You So Much =D xxxxxx

Hope everyone else is good and stuff ^_^
::hugs to all::

Not done much recently.
Did another Theory driving test, failed it again.... I passed the hazard part with flying colours this time, but only got 28 Questions right and you need 30, What a pain. 
So now I gotta tell my driving instructor again, eye-eye-eye. -_- ""Zordon! what's that in the viewing globe?""
""That, Alpha, is the White Ranger!""
""White, Ranger Tiger Powaire! White Ranger Tiger powaire, White Ranger Tiger Powaire! White Ranger Tiger Powaire, Tiger Powaire Noow! Go White ranger right Noooow!""
Hehe...
Urm, lets see... Haven't really done much else in my life latly. Besudes the usual, Talking to Jen, playing games, More talking to Jen, More playing games, Eating, Drinking, Sleeping. 
Play Diablo II still. With Rob this time, he's decided to join a Clan on it which i'm in, Known as [Pd], [PD] - Pyschotic Defiency, or however you spell it. 
hehe...
Hmm.. lets see...
Another Driving lesson on Tuesday. 10:40, Again, Always the same day / Time, 'Cos he reserves for peoples. 
Been in the house on my own  this weekend, Parents wen't to Nottingham to a party with friends of the net, which the seem to do every few months, So the Kids wen't to my aunties. I've heard so many noises the last 2 nights kept thinking I was getting burgled. >_<
Hmmms.... brains dead. Nothing more to say..

""Send The Pain Below""

I like having hurt,
So send the pain below where I need it,
You used to beg me to take care of things,
And smile at the thought of me failing.

But long before, having hurt,
I'd send the pain below,
I'd send the pain below.

Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating,
(I'd send the pain below...)
Much like suffocating,
(I'd send the pain below...)

You used to run me away,
All while laughing.
Then cry about the fact,
'til I returned.

But long before, having hurt,
I'd send the pain below,
I'd send the pain below.

Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating,
Much like suffocating,
(I'd send the pain below...)
Much like suffocating,
(I'd send the pain below...)
Much like suffocating.

I can't feel my chest,
Need more, drop down,
Closing in.

I can't feel my chest,
Drop down.

I liked, having hurt.
So send the pain below,
So send the pain below,
(Much like suffocating) [I liked]
So send the pain below,
(Much like suffocating) [Having hurt]
So send the pain below,
(Much like suffocating)
So send the pain below,
(Much like suffocating)
So send the pain below."

"event","Hellooooo. H'am updating from jens house, yup, That's right. I'm here again. Until the 1st of November.
Well... To start off, Jens got the flu, and i've been fine the last two days, but, Baaaaaaaah, I've caught it too, Only getting headaches and feeling woozey now and then, but I know it's coming.
Secondly...
My poor Doggie Waggie =(
He's 16, Had alot of fun with him, but mum rang me the other night, while I was eating my tea.
Apparently my parents thought he had an ear infection, due to puss coming out and seeing sores there, etc.
So they took him the vets... and they told my parents it's not an ear infection, it's something wrong with his central nervous system, So he won't be lasting long. =(
He's gotta go back to the vets next week, but he keeps falling over, and his eyes keep rolling back and forth in and out of his head... So i'm guessing he'll probably be.. Put to sleep next week or so.
I kinda did wanna be away for when he dies, because I don't wanna see him go, but I never had a chance to say Goodbye. -_-
Ahwell... I did kinda say goodbye before I came to Jens.

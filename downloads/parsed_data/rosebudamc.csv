"event","I spent A LOT of time with Aaron which is good b/c I have tons of fun with him but stinx b/c now I will miss him DEARLY this week.

I have been thinking a lot lately about high school and everything.  How everything has changed and how people have changed.  I don't let people affect me and my relationships anymore and I am more proud of who I am now.  I love where I am in my life right now.  I love being 16 and being able to have certain freedoms.  I love having an awesome boy like Aaron in my life.  I love having awesome girls in my life like kree, ojay, karoline, corey, Bianca, and Kathryn.  I want to get closer to all of them in the coming months.  I love the friends I have made.  And I love the stuff I have ""lost"".  I love knowing I had a ""bad past"" and I fixed it with the help of Aaron and some other friends. I love that my space helped me to meet Kree and she has introduced me to some awesome girls.  I love that I don't feel the need to be reblious to have fun.  I love going out with high schoolers and having an awesome time just being stupid with out having the un-needed drama, alcohol, drugs.  I love that I have the opportunity to fix my relationship with god or to build a stronger one.  I wish I had what some of you have with god.  I read all of yalls l-jay and i wish i could be that confident with my faith.  I don't like seeing how some perfectly good kids who have always been strong in their faith have began slipping slowly away from god.  I dont like to hear that they dont like someone b/c they dont drink/get high/go to parties that they arent any fun.  I dont like being told to keep secrets from someone i really care about from a guy who is supposedly their best friend.  I dont like hearing about their drunken escapades and how they want to get laid before they leave high school.  I love that everyone asks me if me and Aaron have sex and I can say no and be perfectly happy with that.  I hate that people think that's wrong of us not to and that we need to b/c if we dont our relationship is weak.  I dont like being judged and told that b/c of the way i look i have to have sex.  i love how happy i am with everything in my life right now and that i dont let little things affect me.  I love being in high school, i love those drives to aaron's dorm after school on wednesdays, i love being 16, i love lil moments that mean absolutley nothing at the time in which they happen but when you look back they mean sooo much.  ahh ok well i have to go i love you so much and ill update sometime soon hoepfully xoxo ainslee"

Am I supposed to become one of those born again christians and that is all i talk about?  OR  am i supposed to be more quiet and reserved?  Does being outgoing mean you have to be another way too?  I mean i have become closer to god and all over the summer and I am still confused on that whole topic but jsut to show i dont party and everything anymore what do i have to do?  It doesnt make much sense to me for some reason.  I have actually encountered someone who wont be nice to me b/c of how i used to be.  They said they have to see a change.  what does that mean?

"event","As pretty much everyone who will read this knows.  Me and Haley are no longer friends.  We had a rough lil ""break up"" and because of that i have to deal with something different every couple of months.  Well today me and Sarah went to go study and on our way to BAM she asks me what really happened between me and Haley and I asked her why she asked and she said b/c her mother told her on the phone (when sarah called to get permission to go) that she was going out to lunch with Ms. Laura to talk about what ""really happened"".  So...  Here comes the drama.  I have heard Haley's side of the story.  I have heard the stuff she has said about me.  I know what's the truth and what's not.  Why does an older woman feel the need to gossip about a 16 year old girl?  Is she that bored that she feels the need to spread lies about me?  So after discussing stuff that sarah had heard here is what i would like to say.
*I DID have to take a lie-detector test
*I DID pass it
*You can't lie and pass a lie-detector test
*My parents did not buy my car b/c i passed the test
*I DO know what I saw that night
*I do not discuss what i saw except to the other person who saw it and knows she saw it
*I do not talk bad about you or spread retarded rumors
*I Do know what really happened that night and so do my parents and and someother people that were there
*you know what you did that night
*i know what you did that night
*other people saw what you did that night
*you werent on a sofa.... get over it


Ok now that i fixed those so when someone says them they can just look that up.  I totally stand behind all of that, I have said.  I have tried to handle this in every way i know how.  I am not going to *fight dirty* like you b/c i am better than that.  I am sorry that your mother feels threatened being in the same store as my family.  And that she feels the need to call your father.  That's really sad.....   But whatever I am totally over what happened in May!  And I think that you should get a life and get over it to.  Apparently we are both WAY better off being not friends.  I am sorry that you feel the need to talk bad about me behind my back and to spread lies.  BUt I can take whatever you throw at me b/c You and me both know what really happened and so does god so maybe you should just stop beating a dead horse k?"

But yea... Anyways.  I already posted a blog of my day on my space.  i dk why b/c i never post anything on there.  But at lunch today an interesting topic came up.  We (my friends and I )  are at a stage in our high school *career*  where you kinda look around and see how people have changed.  We were talking about it today and it's weird how some of us have turned out.  Its crazy to see all your old circles and how they have turned out.  And It's really weird to see you bff's that you some how lost touch with acting completely and totally diff then how you knew them.  Just saying this today b/c i found out one of my best friends from middle school now smokes pot, goes to parties,and has sex with random people every weekend.  How is it possible that people do that?  How can you change so much over that amount of time even people i was friends with last yar have changed.  Or how some of the worst acting people have changed into big time christians.  I wonder if i have made a drastic change in some peoples eyes?  its just weird to think about i geuss.. or maybe i am just weird and nieve and think that people are always going to stay the same innocent people i once knew.  I geuss i just started feeling really disappointed in people i have knwon and feeling let down which i know i shoudlnt feel i just do.  well i better go. xoxo ainslee"

The dorm is co-ed (i didnt know this, We's roomate is a stupid druggie).  I realized he's not 5 min away anymore.  It was just sad.  All of a sudden I felt so little ad realized that I am not going to have the same expierences as him anymore..  (if that makes since)  I felt totally out of his world and very distant, I wanted to throw up.  It was all I could do to hold back tears until Micheal, Matt, Matt and Farley left the room.  But then ofcourse I talked to Aaron and had a lil cry and he made me feel way better!  lol He is ONLY 20 min away.  I can drive there.  He can drive here..  I will see him for our date nights and I know he will enjoy campus life.  I also realized i DO NOT want to live in a dorm.. EWW... Aaron's is nice and he will probably love it but def not for me...  Its smaller than my room now it seems like and it feels like a classroom.  But oh well.  His school starts thursday, its all exciting and frightening.. i am worried about what will happen next but I am very happy to be with him right now.. I love him and i know what ever happens he will be there for me.. xoxo ainslee"

He told me he was coming home Monday but Sunday at like 9:45 he called acting really hyper and i had jsut hopped out of the shower to pick up the phone and i told him to call me back in like 3 min so i could rinse my hair..  So i rinse off and then my mom comes banging on my door.  Sayin i have to let Finley and to put on some clothes and not just go run and do it in my towel.. so yea i get some clothes on  and go and pick up the midget to take him downstairs when my baby walks around the corner.. lol i couldnt stop yelling i dropped everything my cell and my brush.. thankfully i didnt drop finley..  omg...  lol I LOVE HIM SOO MUCH>> lol hes really sweet... and i missed him sooooo much.  ahh but yea today i woke up at like 10:30 and got dressed and went to get aaron's b-day cards since he was away on his b-day my rents decided to throw him a lil thing here...  lol so yea aaron called and he was coming over around 1 so i went and followed aaron on the way to my house... then we ran errands and went back to my house fer a lil while.  went to his house and ate then came back here and ate.. then went to his house and he shot off fireworks then he dropped me off...  yep... very good day!! i am very glad to have my papa back...  but yea... im just in a good mood and i missed him...

This Saturday is my family's BBQ  so yea.  That should be fun... haha  Yesterday I went to Yoga class... lol it was interesting we did contact yoga.  It was weird lol b/c you stretched your body with someone it was a lil bit awkward.  But yea I am just in a really good mood.  Everything is going really well for me right now and I'm having lots of fun and all that.  I saw Tracy the other day in traffic it was weird lol he looks a lot diff than what he used to.  But yea.  My dad thinks i should start gettin more involved in my church's youth group so i think there is something we are doing that is coming up but who knows.  I am supposed to help out with vbs but i dont know when that is either.  Im actually excited about that.. haha is that weird?  i never thought i would like working with kids but i actually do.  


*random thought****
Aaron told me the other day that i had changed a lot and it was for the better...  
My mom told me that i have changed and so did my dad

Have i really changed that much?  I mean i geuss i am a lot happier but what's changed? i dont see it..."

And then Aaron was outside and said he was coming to my house b/c he didnt have small group and his parents said he could and la dee dah..  so i listened to trance on the way home and that always puts me in a lovely mood lol  so i got really hyper and junk.. but yea.. today i just realized how uninhibited i am with aaron.  lol i never really thought about how much i dont think about stuff before i say or do it.  like wait if i say this will he think i am retarded.. lol i wish i could be like that with everyone.  and its shcoking and kind of relieveing that it doesnt run him off i geuss would be the way to put it.  i have never had anyone treat me like that.. i cant remember truely being my self around someone.. i usually end up chainging myself in the least bit just so i can relate to them a little bit more... which isnt usually a good thing.  but yea i realized that and it made me really happy for seom reason...

next week is aaron's 18th b day i have to go buy his presents sometime.  it kind of makes me sad.. i really dont like thinking about our ages just b/c i never think of him as older than me and i never think of how it looks to other people but i started to today.. he is going to be 18 with a 15 year old..  argh i wish we were older.  i am scared about him starting college.  i am not sure what it will do to us.  i am scared about if we will have to go through the same crap we went through when we first started dating with the whole.. holy crap senior and freshman...  but atleast now i have friends who understand what we have and dont not like aaron.. ahh!  ok well yea... summer is going by so quickly and i am scared for school to start.. everything iss going to change and it makes me want to cry thinking of it..  argh...  well i geuss i had better go.

I have been very happy... for the most part ever since mothers day.  i have no clue why... except for all the events that have gone on on that particular weekend... i think i realized how point less it is to do certain things... like lie... it's only gonna come back to get you... or do certain things to.. impress..  people...  and i dk it's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders...  I had some baggage weighing me down and now that it is off i feel sooo much better...  this baggage had been REALLY weighing me down and once IT was gone i was fine..  I confessed everything i had ever done wrong to my parents... i told them about smoking... drinking with friends that i had had over, sneaking out... it was amazing...  they totally didnt care... i told them how much more straightened out i had become...  and they actually believed me... I really treated them like crap over the past almost 2 years... they even bought me that ridiculous first car ((harley truck)) b/c they thought it would make me happy with them.. i feel bad for always making them feel like they did something wrong in raising me... And i hate how they have spoiled me over the years just to make me a little more happy with them...  but yea... ever since i have confessed everything i feel sooo much better.  gosh! they only thing that sucks is how much i have pushed people away over the past year. i got really obsessed with certain things that i forgot some of the people who had been there for me.  and now im realizing that i dont really have that many people who care around me. I don't trust people like i should and for some reason i push people away before they get so close.  i really don't know why i do that. and i wish i could become friends with the people i have pushed away again.  and the friends that i did have that were guys i realized they werent really my friends as soon as i stopped being what they considered ""fun"" they stopped wanting to be around me.  It's sad...  but i dk it doesnt upset me that much.  i am very happy with my life and everything like that.

"event","Wow today was an AWESOME day...  I got to spend sometime with Aaron and that always makes things better... EEK!  But yea after he left I went to the gym and ""Elly"" was there.  We got to talking about realtionships and being how old we are and all that jazz....  ""Elly"" doesn't think it's right for people who are in high school to have SERIOUS relationships... Now when I say SERIOUS relationships I don't necessarily mean having sex.  I mean relationships where you TRULEY love the person and can NOT wait to see them everyday.  Stuff you don't think is possible until you experience it.  Now ""Elly"" is the type of girl who has sex... NOTHING is wrong with that... I mean if you believe that it is alright.  Then fine... I don't do it but i have nothing against people who do.  It is their choice.  But ""elly"" was saying that SERIOUS relationships when you are younger is a waste of time.  You should have fun and expierence new things.  Go out and meet new people and have flings... I don't know about that... I have been dating Aaron nine and a half months.  We have been through soooo much together.  Is it a waste of our time?  I dk if  I agree with ""Elly"" on that.  I know for sure that if it wasn't for Aaron I wouldn't be who I am today.  I am POSITIVE about that.  I heard somewhere once that A girl should be better off b/c she has been with a certain guy.  That the guy has the responsibility to take care of the girl,-spiritually, emotionally, and physically.  The girl should be stronger in all of these ways b/c of that one guy.  Which I feel that I am... When I met Aaron this past summer... I am not exactly sure where I was going.  I was getting into some stuff I shouldn't have.  Now hold up, I wasn't really doing anything illegal... Not yet anyways.  I smoked, drank, snuck out of the house, took caffeine pills, led guys on....  If I had continued doing all of that I am not really sure where I would be right now.  I think I would have continued doing all of that stuff to myself until I couldn't get out of it.  I Probably wouldn't be a virgin right now and I probably would be high right now.  So why are relationships a waste of time?!?!? So everything we have been through together is a waste?? Nothing is worth the effort? I am really confused on that one.  And I know that isn't the case for me.  Aaron helped me in a very brig way.  I can't see why that would be a waste...    Well I dk why I posted this exactly but it was jut something that came up today and intrigued me.  It seems weird to me that people don't understand how me and Aaron can have what we have with out having sex.. I Dont really think sex makes you stronger.  I always thought it weakened people and got them confused with their emotions.  But I also know people who have sex and have very strong relationships and are around our age...  But oh well just some strange questions to put out there i geuss... well ill update later.  XoXo ainslee meredith"

My parents have forgiven me and understand that what i said is the truth... So i am thankful for that.  I have gotten everything back and we are going to go car shopping this weekend!! EEK!! (very excited)  I got to school and met Aaron and walked around with him.  Went to first block... SNORE!! Omm took a test and talked to Brittany about stuff that has been going on.  I really like Brittany, she is a swell person.  SO she showed me prom pics from this weekend and she looked B-E-A-utiful....  SO i walked to 2nd block with Aaron and talked with Jesse about this girl he is getting ready to date.  She seems alright i geuss...  Went to 3rd block, had a sub with a very strange voice.. BLAH!!  LOL and talked to jordan... She had no one to sit with so she came and palled around with me today at lunch.. Ryan and jackie skipped so she was lonely today.. Tomorrow is her and Ryan's 1 month! YaY!!!  Very happy for u 2.  Lunch was mostly good except for when i told someone something.. I thought they should kno, but they went and cried and called their dad.  I geuss i get it but i WAS just trying to help her out but i geuss she got the wrong message.  I really dont get how things get so messed up sometimes but i geuss things worked out ok.. i just lost someone who was a sister to me this weekend and i can't even wanr her about something without her crying.. i really didn't even realize i was that scary... but apparently i am...  ugh i can't even believe i am writing this b/c i kno it will probably get printed out and mailed to my parents or soemthin....  even tho this isn't even a PISSED OFF entry... this is my only way to reflect tho for right now.  It will take me a while to build up the same friendship with someone else that i just lost.  WOW!!  But i do have other friends and i will move on and maybe one day me and the other people involved will look back on this and realize how stupid and overblown this all was... everyone over reacted... not only one person is at fault... bad decisions were made but no ones life should be ruined over it.. ok well i geuss i got that off my chest... i will probably end up editing this entry but i think it is good to atleast type it out for now... to get it off my chest.. but i kno that i am not going to talk about it again b/c it is over with... but to the person who knows about what im talking about... if you read this.. i am sorry, we just lost something very precious, our friendship meant so much to me..  we told each other everything and i CAN tell you this i will NOT go around telling all of our secrets for pay back b/c no matter what i kno wut you and i had with each other over the years... you were apart of my family and i hope you understand that you can still trust me with all you ever told me. Just like i hope i can trust you.  i dont want this to be a bitter end b/c we are better than that...  i still love you very much... and i still love your family very much.. thank you for everything.. i hope that you understand what this whole thing was about and don't go tell your parents that i am doing somethin im not...  but this is the last i will talk about it, when i see you at school i will smile and say hey but that's all i can do b/c of the restrictions my parents have set.  you are a wonderful person and i wish you well...  

Love Always Ainslee"

"event","Hey I haven't really been keeping up with this lately so i figured i would update.  Well today was basically a good day i saw Aaron a lot and thats always a good thing.  He isn't gonna be at school tomorrow b/c of physics so blah! But anyways... Spring Break was good. It didnt all suck except for some lil points. I got my restricted yay baby! lol yea im happy.  lol and my rents took me and aaron to atlanta.  Then i went to charleston with aaron's parents.  But anyways i havent really spent that much time with haley in the past weeks.  I hope we will grow closer again over the summer, i miss her so... sometimes i just feel like she resents me for something. i dk wut but something... i dont remember doing nething to her to make her mad but apparently i have.  argh oh well... i have been doing rele well in school lately and i will probably finish up early after all which is good.. next week is a 4 day week for me... prom is next saturday so im skipping friday to just play around.  well yea... i hope haley can skip with me... i rele want to spend some time with her b/c i haven't in forever.  the summer is nearly here... i cant believe it what a year...  it has been on the whole rele good... I cant believe aaron is graduating.. i dunno wuts gonna happen with us in college.. but for now im just enjoying spending time with him.  next year will be good ill basically be done with all my credits except for a little bit..  not much drama any more i have basically stopped hanging around anyone who would give me drama...  i have probably shut out a lot of people this year, which makes me sad, but at the same time its a good thing b/c at the beginning of the year i wasn't hanging out with the right people and i wouldnt be where i am today if i hadn't of changed.  i cant believe how much everyone has changed things are so different not and i thought that would have scared me but its almost comforting seeing how people change i geuss just to see them and compare them to how they used to be to now.  but i had better go.. xOxO ains"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium;"">I travel a fair amount for work so my company has pre-negotiated rates with hotels &amp; rental cars and when I'm on the road, time and convenience are two very important factors. However, when it comes to my own personal travel, I've known that rates do vary depending on travel dates, discounts available and so forth.<br /><br />My pet peeve is rental cars. Renting a car at the airport these days brings on a lot of extra fees and in many cases, enormous rate differences for the same car. Case in point: I wanted to rent a car from Hertz to drive from Palm Springs to SF as I had bought a piece of furniture that I&nbsp;needed to cart home. I went online, put in my discount code and came up with two vastly different rates for the same car (Chevrolet Impala).<br /><br />Daily rate from Hertz airport: $112.04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Tax: $10.91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Airport Concession Fee recovery: $12.47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Vehicle Licensing Cost recovery: $0.28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Customer Facility Surcharge: $10.00<br />California Tourism Commission assessment: $3.92<br />Total:$149.62<br /><br /></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Daily rate from Hertz Local Edition: $67.49</span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Tax: $5.93</span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br /></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Vehicle Licensing Cost Recovery: $0.28<br />Total; $73.70</span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br /><br />That's a $75.92 difference for the same car going to the same location!<br /><br />And here's another hot tip - you can rent from Hertz Local Edition and return to the airport and pay the fees and rates from Local Edition and not have to pay the other fees if you rented at the airport. It doesn't work in every city - sometimes they tack on a daily mileage charge so read your reservation very carefully. Also, most Hertz Local Edition offices are closed on weekends and are open during &quot;bankers hours&quot;&nbsp;(i.e., 8am - 5pm) on weekdays.<br /><br />The reason I prefer Hertz is that they have the most locations and a very strong &quot;Local Edition&quot; program around the country. Avis would be my second choice with National the last (although I do love National's Emerald Aisle at major airports where I&nbsp;can choose my own car to rent when on business).<br /></span><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" style=""margin-bottom: 5px; width: 775px; height: 19px;""><tbody><tr><td valign=""bottom"" style=""border-bottom: 1px dotted rgb(69, 69, 69); width: 80%;"">&nbsp;</td><td nowrap=""nowrap"" valign=""bottom"" align=""right"">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium;"">One of the musical treats of Palm Springs is <a href=""http://www.kwxy.com"">KWXY</a>. It's an FM radio station whose format is Beautiful Music, a format that's mostly instrumental or instrumental with vocalists and was popular from the 60's through the 80's. &quot;Elevator Music&quot;, &quot;Muzak:, &quot;Mood Music&quot; and &quot;Easy Listening&quot;&nbsp;describes this genre.<br /><br />Driving down to the desert, once you hit the outskirts of Beaumont, I tune the radio to 98.5 on the FM dial and out of the speakers flows this &quot;heavenly music&quot;&nbsp;laden with melodies, rich strings, horns and beautiful, clear vocals:&nbsp;from love songs to ballads and lovely harmonies in the backgrounds. Truly it's a genre in its own world and makes the best background music to work or listen to as you go about your day.<br /><br />KWXY also has some of the best DJ's from the old school of disc jockeys: none of this shock-in-your-face garbage or silly contests:&nbsp;just DJ's who know their music and know their audience which happens to be a very aging bunch of retirees or people like me who really love this uncluttered genre of music.<br /><br />Last but not least, KWXY&nbsp;was locally owned and operated. These days most radio stations are either owned by networks or conglomerates, like Clear Channel. That's why no matter where you go you'll find the same stations and shows everywhere (&quot;Bob FM&quot; for rockers, Dave Koz for the smooth jazz folks). It's dull and boring.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I&nbsp;turned on the radio on Wednesday morning only to learn that the station was sold and the format would be ending on Sunday</span>. <span style=""font-size: medium;"">I was crushed. Where else, other than XM radio could I&nbsp;find beautiful music?<br /><br />So I&nbsp;did what I always do when I want to find something out: I hit the internet, specifically Wikipedia. Sure enough there was a whole article on Beautiful Music listing many stations that still play this format. Here are some stations that stream these lush sessions online:<br /><br /></span><meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8""><meta name=""ProgId"" content=""Word.Document""><meta name=""Generator"" content=""Microsoft Word 11""><meta name=""Originator"" content=""Microsoft Word 11""><link rel=""File-List"" href=""file:///C:\DOCUME~1\MGB\LOCALS~1\Temp\msohtml1\01\clip_filelist.xml"" /><o:smarttagtype namespaceuri=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"" name=""State""></o:smarttagtype><o:smarttagtype namespaceuri=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"" name=""City""></o:smarttagtype><o:smarttagtype namespaceuri=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"" name=""place""></o:smarttagtype><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

"event","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Saturday night we had a phenomenal dinner at Chez Squalid's river retreat. Every time I&nbsp;go over there's always something new. This time it was the snazzy new sunporch. Mike and Tom were the other guests and we feasted on a sumptuous meal with great wines and a gorgeous table set by the Sarge who was channeling Miss Hill in a big way. What a delight!<br /><br />Sunday morning I woke up at 4am with an ominous pain I'd had before. I thought it was acute Gastrointeritis but it turned out to be a major gall bladder attack.I had just enough time to get dressed nicely (khakis, sport shirt, socks, loafers; don't ask, it's me) and hustle to the hospital before the inevitable happened - violent vomiting and acute stomach pain. I have to say, the emergency room personnel at our local hamlet hospital in the country are so sweet and accommodating. Of course they're not used to a 'take charge' guy like me (&quot;screw the Morphine, it doesn't work. Just give me 2 injections of Diottin'&quot;). Eventually when things were calming down I&nbsp;called Miss Hill ('guess who I&nbsp;slept with last night - and where?'). They dragged me in for a CatScan where I&nbsp;found out there was something wrong with the gallbladder. So back to SF&nbsp;today to get a referral and run over to the hospital and find out what Chapter 2 is going to be on this little saga. Next step: lining up the doctors. Christ. Always something.<br /><br />I saw Bruce Vilanch roaming aorund Union Square last week. Seeing all of him - this time wearing yet another stained t-shirt - reminded me of a time he was supposed to stay at the hotel. This must have been around 2000. Anyways, I ordered a VIP gift, a custom cookie made to look like the Hollywood Squares checkerboard with a big heart in the center square. Underneath the checkerboard the script was to have read &quot;You're our favorite secret square&quot;.<br /><br />Instead it came out reading &quot;You're our favorite secret squirrel&quot;.<br /><br />Fortunately he cancelled at the last minute as he got nicer accommodations. </span></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Hopefully next to a dry cleaners.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: medium;"">What is it about Bruce that he can't dress decently? I know the guy is overweight but there are plenty of oveweight guys who can still wear something other than a t-shirt and jeans. And with Bruce's income, he has plenty of moolah to go to a tailor and get a couple of pants and shirts made. Truly, there is no excuse to looking like a slob 24/7. <br /><br />Speaking of the Rrazz room (where Bruce played last week) Diane Schuur is opening on Wednesday the 20th for a four night gig. If you love jazz and standards, she is a must. If you haven't been to the Rrazz Room, do. It's dressy (coats for the guys, ties optional but preferred), classic and fun. And she puts on a great show.<br /><br />Back to me pain pills</span>. <br />"

The famous couple journeyed between their principal residence in New York City; their Hispanic-Moresque winter estate (Mar-a-Lago) in Palm Beach; and Camp Topridge, the couple&rsquo;s summer retreat in the Adirondacks of upstate New York. It was also used extensively for entertainment, as Post was known as a lavish hostess. <br /><br />The Huttons divorced in 1935 and the <em>Hussar </em>became a part of Post&rsquo;s settlement. She later remarried <strong>Joseph E. Davies, </strong>a Washington, D.C. attorney and ambassador to the Soviet Union and Belgium. After the Davies left for the Soviet Union in 1937, the <em>Hussar </em>was sold to the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway.<br /><br />It was then used as a business car in the 1960s for railway executives. With the advent of Amtrak, the car may have been scrapped if it were not for rail aficionado <strong>DeWitt Chapple Jr. </strong>He bought the car and restored it. <br /><br />Chapple retained the car&rsquo;s number, but added the name Chapel Hill after his alma mater, the University of North Carolina, in Chapel Hill. In 1972, he used his newly refurbished private car for a trip to Philadelphia on the rear of Amtrak&rsquo;s National Limited (formerly a crack streamliner for the Pennsylvania Railroad).

P. Morgan's </strong>yacht <em>Corsair </em>with toilet paper from a chartered airplane. During and immediately after obtaining his degree from Harvard, Beebe published several books of poetry, but eventually found his true calling in journalism. He had a major interest in railroads, their history, and owned two private cars with his life-partner <strong>Charles Clegg. </strong><br /><br />The <em>Gold Coast </em>is now an honored showpiece at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento.<br /><br />These elegant American railway carriages mostly built by the Pullman Company during the early part of the 20th century personified the comparable exclusivity of today&rsquo;s personal jet. But these mansions on rail were far more opulent and visible. They were not parked on the far side of an airport but attached to the rear of yesterday&rsquo;s named trains: the <em>Chief, Detroiter, Commodore Vanderbilt </em>and the<em> Florida Limited.</em><br /><br />Mrs. Post didn&rsquo;t look out at the sky or breathe re-circulated air or dine on something a little better than first class airline food. She slept in private staterooms, dined in privacy and lounged comfortably in opulent observation salons. The cars had rear platforms were these privileged travelers watched America scenery pass them by. <br /><br />World War II changed all that with the advent of the private airplane. In the 1960s, the number of private cars numbered three. The most famous was the <em>Virginia City </em>owned by Beebe and Clegg. By the time Amtrak took over the U.S. passenger railway system most of the private cars were abandoned and in neglect. <br />&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""555"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td valign=""top""><img height=""8"" alt="""" width=""1"" src=""http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i/fasten.gif"" /></td></tr><tr><td valign=""top"" style=""background-color: #999999""><img height=""1"" alt="""" width=""1"" src=""http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i/fasten.gif"" /></td></tr><tr><td valign=""top""><img height=""8"" alt="""" width=""1"" src=""http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i/fasten.gif"" /></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""348"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td valign=""top""><em><img height=""470"" alt="""" width=""555"" src=""http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i/partypictures/12_12_08/privatecars/mastsonmisc.002.jpg"" /></em></td></tr><tr><td class=""photocaption"" valign=""top"">Lucius Beebe and Charles Clegg dining aboard the <em>The Virginia City</em> being served by steward Clarence Watkins.</td></tr></tbody></table><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""348"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td valign=""top""><em><img height=""466"" alt="""" width=""555"" src=""http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i/partypictures/12_12_08/privatecars/mastsonmisc.002_0001.jpg"" /></em></td></tr><tr><td class=""photocaption"" valign=""top"">The drawing-obersavation salon of Beebe and Clegg's <em>Virginia City</em> decorated in 1954 by Robert Hanley of Los Angeles.</td></tr></tbody></table><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""555"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td valign=""top""><img height=""8"" alt="""" width=""1"" src=""http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i/fasten.gif"" /></td></tr><tr><td valign=""top"" style=""background-color: #999999""><img height=""1"" alt="""" width=""1"" src=""http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i/fasten.gif"" /></td></tr><tr><td valign=""top""><img height=""8"" alt="""" width=""1"" src=""http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/i/fasten.gif"" /></td></tr></tbody></table><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""555"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td valign=""top"">Chapple, along with other private individuals, bought these cars rich with history and have preserved them.

There is an observation platform, lounge, dining salon, staterooms, kitchen and crew quarters. A chef and steward meet all your needs. The car can comfortably accommodate six to eight passengers. The charter price runs around $80,000 for a seven to ten day trip. An example itinerary would be from Chicago to Seattle, visiting Yellowstone, then onto San Francisco and return to Chicago via the Colorado River Gorge. Transportation, accommodations and meals are included. There would be layovers in the national parks and cities en-route. <br /><br />An expert in dealing with the various requirements of travel in the USA and Canada when it comes to private cars, Chapple can tailor an itinerary for a unique and very deluxe tour of the USA.

It was extremely sad.<br /><br />Fortunately the good weather, the ride down the Sausalito hill and the sunny expanse that greeted us in Mill Valley changed my mood.

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium;"">While we've all had our rant and rage over Prop 8, we need to get beyond the disappointment and look towards our future. The final decision rests with the court and in my opinion, once a right has been established you can't take it away. I'm hoping the court sees it the same way. <br /><br />In the meantime, for those who got married whether your marriages are validated or not, your commitments to each other haven't changed and that's what's important. Still, partners need to protect each other and this is what you need to do.<br /><br />1. Even if you got married, be sure to be domestic partners also. Whether the marriages performed are valid or not, domestic partners still get many advantages, most importantly no stepped up basis on property taxes should one partner die. This is the same right offered to married couples who own property together. So if you got married but didn't register as Domestic Partners, do that immediately. <br /><br />2. Next, make sure you have a durable Healthcare Power of Attorney for each other. This document states that your partner can make your medical decisions for you in case you are incapacitated and unable to communicate your wishes. The document also allows you to write out these wishes such as no resusitation, no heroics, etc. Whether you are domestic partners or not, this is essential.<br /><br />3. If you and your partner own property together then you need to each establish your own trusts. A trust avoids probate court when you die and allows you to will your assets to anybody you wish to as is written in your will which is part of the trust. See a qualified trust attorney. Even if you don't own real estate but have bank accounts or an automobile that you own outright, you need to have a trust. The last thing you want to do is die and have everything go to probate court. Trust me, it's a fucking mess. So if you're leaving everything to your partner in a trust, you can do that. You can also put a challenge clause in the trust document that states if your&nbsp; trust is challenged by one of the beneficiaries that they automatically will lose what was left to them. Again, you don't need to be domestic partners to do this.<br /><br />How to find the right attorney for you? Check your local Bar association for a listing of Estate Planning attorneys. Or check with your pals. Or check your local Gay business organization. Just make sure they are licensed in the state where they practice and are a member of state Bar association.</span><br />"

Many of our friends have been together for more than 25 years &ndash; I&rsquo;m talking real years, not gay years &ndash; and it&rsquo;s only fitting and nice that they have ended their &ldquo;long-term engagement&rdquo; and make it all legal. In speaking with our newly married bunch, almost all of them have gotten married privately by themselves or with a couple of extremely close friends in attendance. Most of them have avoided the mass marriage bit at City Hall and have opted to be married in a variety of locations: everything from a garden setting to the back seat of a vintage 1948 Cadillac convertible (the birth year of one couple). One couple got married with their best friends at the same time (a double ring ceremony, I think they call it), another on the Marin Headlands at sunrise.

<![endif]-->  <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: larger;"">In my twenty years in the hospitality industry, I was involved in weddings. For years, I&rsquo;ve always had the Director of Catering report to me because catering is a function of sales. I&rsquo;ve been involved in close to 1,000 weddings. I&rsquo;ve seen it all &ndash; from the tremendously simple to the horrendously overblown to downright dreadful. At one point or another I&rsquo;ve been called in to deal with wedding planners, an interesting cult. Some are terrific, others are egomaniacs, all of them have to deliver delusions of grandeur on a budget. Or at least try to. I&rsquo;ve seen catfights between relatives over everything: dress, seating, d&eacute;cor, gifts. Early at the start I learned to banish money trees, bride and groom cakes, hip-hop bands, cocktail bars by the hour and long food tasting sessions. I taught my directors and their staff that they did not have to work with every bridal party that came in the door. If anyone was rude, flip, cheap or obnoxious, I told them that we did not have to contract the space. I&rsquo;d already had my share of headaches the first couple of years when the staff would book anyone with a pulse. And last but not least, everything &ndash; and I do mean everything &ndash; had to be paid 7 days in advance or not one fork, one plate or one chair would be set. This resulted in one of the strictest contracts in the industry in an industry that didn&rsquo;t really follow its own contract. While it made me look like an asshole, it made the life of our clients and staff easier as everyone was required to sign and initial each term in the contract.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><o:p></o:p><span style=""font-size: larger;"">What galled me is how much pressure people put on themselves to throw a wedding. I&rsquo;ve seen parents who have had to place second mortgages on their homes just so their little girl could get married &ldquo;properly&rdquo; &ndash; whatever that means &ndash; only to have little girl divorce the idiot 6 months later because he was diddling with his assistant. And no wonder &ndash; that sweet little girl he proposed to a year earlier became an absolute monster absorbed with wedding details and endless expenses just so they could be married. By the time they hit the hotel everyone on wedding day is a bundle of nerves and in the end nobody except the guests have a great time. It&rsquo;s such a sham.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><o:p></o:p><span style=""font-size: larger;"">I remember one time being called in to meet with a couple whose families didn&rsquo;t have much money. The gal had a nice sized ring on her finger that took all of her fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s savings and I got the feeling the parents were living paycheck to paycheck. I looked over the proposal we had presented them and realized that this wedding was well beyond their means. I needed to break this to them gently because I couldn&rsquo;t take their money &ndash; clearly, they couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay for this &ndash; with a clean conscious. So I dismissed the catering salesperson and took the six of them to the bar for a drink.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><o:p></o:p><span style=""font-size: larger;"">I then proceeded to tell them about friends who decided to eschew the traditional and follow their hearts. They got married on a favorite beach and everyone brought something to eat. They had fun little wedding cupcakes that the bride made. No gift bags, no expensive dress, just everyone they loved and wanted to be with. It gave the day a lot of meaning and it was different than anyone else had done. Thank goodness they heeded my advice and did just that.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><o:p></o:p><span style=""font-size: larger;"">I&rsquo;ve been an usher, a best man, I&rsquo;ve had to escort bridesmaids in unattractive dresses, usually dyed in a shade of pink that matches their pussies. I&rsquo;ve been a day-ordained minister. I&rsquo;ve been a guest way too many times to remember. I devoured too many steak dinners, too much champagne and lots of lousy wedding cake. I&rsquo;ve endured too many toast&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;ve had to be stuck in the gristle seat at a table because of my scintillating personality (?) I can entertain difficult or non-communicative table companions on either side of me resulting in an enjoyable evening for them and a groaning experience for me. Whoever started the goody bag concept ought to be shot. I&rsquo;ve been forced to take home everything from a See&rsquo;s truffle (yum) to a jar of foaming bath salts that were mis-labeled and turned out to be crystallized sea salt from Sardinia. (Ugh).</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><o:p></o:p><span style=""font-size: larger;"">And then there are the showers. The girls have to endure the brunt of those but there are a number of them that are either mixed or couples designated. Those are dreadful, especially if you&rsquo;re a gay guy. And the themes &ndash; for the d&eacute;cor and the gifts. My sister-in-law alone had 10 showers. My sister, who was a bridesmaid wailed that she had to get 10 different gifts plus the wedding gift. My advice to her? Get her all the small stuff that people forget to register for in kitchens or bars: dish towels, bottle stoppers or anything made by Good Grips (&lsquo;give her a fucking can opener if you have to&rsquo;).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s such a racket.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><o:p></o:p><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Due to my disgust to weddings in general, I don&rsquo;t languish time or money on a gift. For 20 years, I gave the same thing; a cheese knife set from Gump&rsquo;s. It solved four things for me: priced under $60, perfectly wrapped, a practical gift (good for parties) and a really nice presentation inside. As usual with these things, Gump&rsquo;s stopped carrying this item so a pewter wine coaster now does the trick.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><o:p></o:p><span style=""font-size: larger;"">So many of my friends got married within two years after we graduated from college. With the exception of one couple, all of them divorced their first spouses and remarried. Over the years I saw so many of my parents friends marry and divorce. One time the divorce involved three families who were once very close friends. A lot of husband and wife swapping. Growing up in Beaver Cleaver land, we were sheltered from the details as much as possible but you&rsquo;d hear it from the kids on the playground at school. At one point, all our neighbors surrounding my parents property were divorced.</span></p></meta></meta></meta></meta></div><meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8""><meta name=""ProgId"" content=""Word.Document""><meta name=""Generator"" content=""Microsoft Word 11""><meta name=""Originator"" content=""Microsoft Word 11""><link rel=""File-List"" href=""file:///C:\DOCUME~1\MGB\LOCALS~1\Temp\msohtml1\01\clip_filelist.xml"" /><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

"event","<font size=""3"">One of life's greatest pleasures is reading. I save up most of my reading for Saturday afternoons where it is not uncommon for me to spend up to 6 hours reading away.<br /><br />Yesterday I was reading Vanity Fair, cover-to-cover, one of my favorites. There was an article on the restaurant <a href=""http://www.la-grenouille.com/"">La Grenouille</a>, the venerable French restaurant in New York that has survived every food, lifestyle and innovation fad and then some. In an era where restaurants cost millions to build and then fail in five minutes, I was thinking about restaurants in San Francisco that have continued to have conquered La Grenvouille's status. Not all of them are expensive but all of them hold a certain memory for me and are places I still haunt. Most of all, they are not clamoring with noise and you can actually have a real conversation.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.fleurdelyssf.com"">Fleur de Lys</a>. Arguably the best restaurant in the city, bar none. Superlative service, a gorgeous dining room, phenomenal food. It's not cheap, you have to wear a coat and tie (or else you're out the door, period) and it's all due to the owners and the wonderful chef, Hubert Keller who is one of the sweetest guys you'll ever meet.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.billsplace.qpg.com/"">Bill's Place</a>. This is out in the Richmond at 2315 Clement near 23rd Avenue. Bill's is very dowdy but the burgers can't be beat. They grind their own meat daily and cut their own potatoes for fries. When I want a really good burger and a shake I'll get in the car and run out there. The prices are fair, the service OK but the burgers are phenomenal. <br /><br />The old-guard of restaurants over at Fisherman's Wharf: Alioto's #8, Sabella's, Fisherman's Grotto and Castagnola's. While the food is very straightforward without a lot of innovation, it's great to go there during non-tourists moments like in winter, mid-week. Especially during crab season when it's pretty hard to screw up crab. The rest of the Wharf restaurant scene is ghastly (Bubba Gump Shrimp Company? Cold Stone Creamery? Arrgh!) although it's handy at 9pm when Bill's is closed and you're craving a burger- there's a branch of In and Out there with halfway decent parking.<br /><br />Tadich Grill - in my book, this is where you are going to find the best seafood in town. No reservations, waitstaff in crisp white jackets, an overflowing menu of everything fresh and good - great for lunch or dinner. And a great place to eat by yourself at the counter. My paternal Grandfather ate here almost every day. It also happens to be the City's oldest restaurant, operating since 1869 continually.<br /><br />Sam's Grill - another old timer. This place is a block from my office. I usually meet my childhood friend Steve here once a quarter for lunch. You walk in and the bar is packed with these guys in suits quaffing martinis at 11:30am and not returning to their offices afterwards. But it's the ambiance and interior - so similar to Tadich's with the cream colored walls and old-fashioned light fixtures - and the long menu that reminds me of restaurants closed long ago in San Francisco. Where else can you find Celery Victor, Hang Town Fry, New York Minute Steak or perfectly done Creamed Spinach? Not to mention old-fashioned Au-Gratin potatoes. <br /><br />Alfred's Steakhouse. They're now in the old Blue Fox location. Marianne dragged me here the other week and I forgot about their old-fashioned ""School Night Dinners"" where you can get a wedge salad, a choice of meat and dessert for $41. It's terrific. And the ambiance - on the dark side, lit just right - makes everyone, especially ladies and gentlemen of a certain age - look timeless. Or at least hides the wrinkles while you're sipping a Manhattan and pondering over the menu.<br /><br />It's nice to know that the old timers can still rock.<br /></font>"

"event","<font size=""3"">Normally I don't leave the country on summer weekends. The weather is too lovely and I'd rather spend time at my own house enjoying the pool and reading all afternoon. However, I haven't been in the social swirl, especially with the LJ group. Miss Hill, of course, stayed home to garden so I rang up my friend Chuck and said ""I need an escort to a party and you're it."" Just joking. Chuck lives nearby and I thought he'd enjoy meeting some of the crew.<br /><br />The party I'm talking about was <div class=""ljuser""><font><a href=""http://sfbritskin.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://sfbritskin.livejournal.com/""><b>sfbritskin</b></a></font></div> and Richard's lovely garden party. For those of you who know Richard and Andy, then you know everything was beautiful and comfortable (with a bit of help from <div class=""ljuser""><font><a href=""http://gryphon773.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://gryphon773.livejournal.com/""><b>gryphon773</b></a></font></div>&nbsp;who looked quite fetching in his blue jumpsuit).

All in all, a lot of fun for an hour.&nbsp; I could have stayed longer but I had to get back to the country for a dinner party at our neighbors.

Thank goodness I was able to salvage the seat. <br /><br />Right now I'm a basket case of emotions: happy, excited and nervous as hell. There are some unbelievable physical challenges ahead of me over the next 7 days. <br /><br />Thanks to all of your who pledged. Your care made all the difference in the world. <br /><br />If you were unable to make a pledge, don't worry, you and everyone else can make a difference for me during the ride. <b>It's free and it will make a world of difference to me</b>: send a message of support to me while I'm on the ride. <b>Just go to www.aidslifecycle.org and click on the button to send a message of support</b>.

"event","Mom wasn't too excited with the meandering out-loud thinking in regard to moving back to Arcata, living with Mallory, and working for a year. Immediately she gave me the rational-logical argument, and of course I already knew it, but I wanted to see what she thought. Of course, that I pretty much could have foreseen too. Dad didn't say anything, but I think that's because in the back of his mind, he wouldn't mind if I moved out there again -- he knows I will eventually. Mom is focused on keeping me focused on school.

And that's probably a smart idea.

Arcata Plaza. They have a quaint little farmers market here every Saturday during the summer and autumn.

I go to Minneapolis this weekend to visit MCAD, and to visit Mollie and Amy. At least I hope I can see Amy; it would be really nice to grab some coffee with her or something. I'm not sure if I'll stay Saturday night as well, but we'll see how things go. I'd rather spend more time out of Stevens Point. :)

Speaking of travelling, although there are no concrete plans yet, I should be en route to New Orleans with Al and Dad, and possibly Maddy, in less than a month. Right around New Years, no less -- it's almost as awesome as Mardi Gras, right? I'm determined that if we're there on New Years, we're going to party it up. We have to, don't we?

Craving seafood. Where's the nearest Red Lobster, folks? Where's the nearest male willing to take me there? ;)"

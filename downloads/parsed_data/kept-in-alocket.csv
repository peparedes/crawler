SENIORS!! 
WOOT WOOT!
I really wish I could go back and re-do my junior year.
i would have never fallen for him or any of the other guys i liked last year. i also would have gotten better grades. whatever though because there isnt much we can do about that. umm i have some of nicole's money but can you help me out with the rest, ima pay her back when she gets back from montana around the 14th. also, this year you need to buy the notebook(s). dude! we better hang out more now that i'm going to be driving because before, yeah it was lame to have our moms pick us up and drop us off everywhere. i need a job to pay for my car insurance really bad. i dont know what else to say so take care and write me back!"

Bri and Monika seem like they are fun. I'm very happy for you, just don't forgett about me. Anyways I feel like crap. I'm sick and I can't breathe. I'm getting a car for Christmas because that's about the time I'll be getting my liscence. I can't wait. We don't have to take the stinky bus anymore and we don't have to be near all those ugly ghetto kids. I don't know what kind of car I want or what I'm getting.

"event","Whoa... a lot has happened since I last wrote you. Right now I am in so much trouble. Ya my mom found I was lying when I said I was going to your place because she was all I'm coming to get you from Eukarys house, so thats when I knew I had to tell the truth. I never met up with Chad cause he's sick. He says its the flu but I'm thinking its mono because everyones reaction to it is different. Lucky for me I don't have it as bad as most people... yet. But ya now I'm grounded for like ever and I probably won't be able to get my permit for a loooooooooooong time now. Well anyway last night was fun. Jessica's boyfriend broke up with her for good this time and she was really sad. I met Monikas friend Jordan and flirted with him all night. I know I know I have a boyfriend but he never calls and I never see him, but I'm not going to break up with him until I know for sure I have a good back up. It sounds fucked but whatever. I looked like the biggest fag ever. I was wearing purple tights and my jeans were rolled up and I had on a hot pink shirt and black flip flops and one glove. Monika, Bri and Jess were all wearing the same too but Monikas tights were yellow Brianas were hot pink and Jessica's were blue. Lol. But ya Jessica's brother drove me and Bri home. God Jess can be a whore sometimes. Before we went up there Briana called Jess and made sure if Monika came and picked us up she would drive us home. And then when it came time to take us home she was being a little bitch about it saying I don't remeber ever telling Bri that I would drive you guys home. But whatever. We were like begging Jordan to drive us home but he was being a dickhole and said he didn't want to drive us all the way out here. I can't complain about it to much he bought me Del Taco. But ya I hope you fell beter. Hmm maybe you have mono too. Fuck! write me back soon. Love ya bye!"

Guys don't like me the way I am, my friends don't like me the way I am. I don't like the way I am. We all decied that this school year was going to be different but for me its starting out the same. I'm happy for you. I hope you get everything you want. Cause seriously I just want to make everyone happy now. And by doing that I think I'll be much happier. Ok I know I've talked a lot about me. I think you should really call that guy. And why do you think he likes Elaine? She has a boyfriend. It's werid. But anyways I really am sorry. I don't want to loose you. Why can't things just be the way they were? Cause I changed. I know. See you later and I'm picking you up tomorrow. I don't care if your mad at me, I'm not letting you hold a grudge. Those don't work. They just get you more mad. I'm the kind of person that thinks you should just let it go. I donno maybe I shouldn't think anymore. I donno what to be anymore.

So that guy last night was cool and I'm scared to call him, I should have just given him my number so that I wouldnt have to call him. I think Frito likes Elaine but Elaine would never take him seriously, I just think she's too shallow. I want to start talking to Frito and trust me I will. I'm so glad of how much I've changed I think hanging around you has boosted my confidence. I love you for that, same with Ashley, she makes me feel like I can be open and weird. So who do you like right now? If it wasn't for this and our notebook it would be hard to keep track of eachother's live. This year is so busy. Like with homework and plans, getting invited places, just so much shit to do. I'm so glad I met your friends. They are real cool, even Elaine's sister. I need to wash my hair because I can't remmeber the last time I washed it and my head is starting to itch.k. well write back.

I wouln't have gone to see Yellowcard, I would have gone to see the Starting Line and Yellowcard would just happen to be there. Yeah, come over tomorrow, k? I washed my hair today, I had to shampoo it a lot before it stopped feeling greasy. I cut it too, I just evened it out a little because it used to be crooked. Next week I'm going to dye it black and stop cutting it myself. Yeah I probably already said that but I don't care. Hey do you want to go see Hawthorne Heights with me?? They are a real good band. Please Tricia. I decided I'm going to stop being such a bitch to certain people. You know who I mean right. That person has done nothing but been kind to me and I am such a bitch to them. You better come over Tuesday because if you were me I would go visit you. I was just kidding about your teeth they are not bad."

I washed it Sunday and it still feels real nice I think I can last like 5 more days but I should wash it Friday morning if I am going to that concert Saturday. I don't want this school year to start yet I think we should have another month off. I haven't eaten today and I already had 2 bottles of water. I'm going to go run 20 miles or something. Hahahaha I can barely run one. I am so going on this diet. Also, I decided I want to be a vegetarian. As much as I love meat I realized that all those cute baby cows on my grandpa's farm get chopped up and turned into the tacos that I eat. I look back and I am really disgusted that I really liked one of his baby sheep, and like the next day they killed it and made this stew stuff and I ate it, I feel sick. Besides meat is fatty. I would never become a vegan though because thats hard. Well write back."

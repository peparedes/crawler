"event","Hey, long time no post. Yes I am still alive. I went to the Wired Frog a couple nights ago to see my friend Mike's band Tone Fetish play. It was pretty cool. I started hangin out with a few hot punk girls. It was pretty cool. So, what else  is there? I played speed racer with a Honda Civic. I ""ALMOST""  kept up with him. Keyword ALMOST. My parents bitched me out for not being home. Then my dad got into the arguement. I j ust said ""Fuck it!"" And drove away. Ha. And lately I havn't been trapped for speeding yet. W00t! <----Another gaming thing    Well, I also got my cell phone. hehe. 219-2911. And thats it for me. Peace."

"event","Hey, now time for my second entry because I am bored. I am about ready to play Day Of Defeat. World War 2 sims are cool. I am drinking some Faygo, so I am a bit hyper, but not really. Kinda Depressed, although I have no reason to be. I am bored, and BAH! I just don't get life. Well, I have no reason not to get these things, so I am gonna go play DoD and kill some Nazis. Stay tuned."

"event","Well, I never thought I'd actually be doing this. I always thought these things were pointless..... but here I am..... Oh well. I guess I caved in to peer pressure. I am always hearing "" C'mon Keith, everybody is doin' it!"" or "" It's the cool thing to do"". SO! Besides, I had nothing better to do at 2:30 in the morning. Well, to those of you who don't know too much about me, I now work at Burger King doing all of the bitch work. I better do some real work soon. Tomorrow I am hangin out with my friend Adam. The funniest thing happened a couple nights ago. I had to work from 3 - 10. I don't know if you have heard of it or not, World's Scariest Police Chases, was due back at midnight. So I decided to just chill out inside Family Video for a couple hours. I just sat down and started watching Sandlot. When midnight came around, the game hadn't come back yet. I was disappointed...but on to of that, I had to ride my bike home. Oh well, what can you do? I bought the game today. Take that over due game people! Yeah, so, my social life has been total shit lately. I wonder why? hah. Well, I have no idea what is going on anymore. People are sending me so many different messages. And then I get blamed when I miss some of them. I feel like I am going insane. What else is new? I've already been there and back. I don't know what it is, but I just have terrible luck with girls. I know what you are thinking..... Oh boo hoo, cry me a river, build a bridge and get over it. Well, to you I say ..... Bah, easy for you to say......  Now, I can't tell how long this entry is going to be. and since I am a computer dork, I have nothing better to do than to look at quotes. And I will probably say a lot of bad gaming jokes. So, this being my first entry, I hope you people say hi to me sometime. I HAVE NO FRIENDS!!! Hey, I got a feeling one of those bad jokes are coming up..... oh well, first post. Not bad. You have to crawl before you can walk, walk before you can run, and run before you can develop some sort of instant matter transmission..... Hey, I must be phsychic..... Well, I won't keep you posted. If I have time, I'll post. But I am lazy, so this wont be a soap opera. TTYL All."

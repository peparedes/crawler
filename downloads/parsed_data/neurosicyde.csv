The change moving through the depths of questioned and unquestionable details. Locking horns into that ever more right. Questing into that long withered night, grasping the lantern and seeking the golden burning truth. When the fires blaze hard and the quibbles become the knife edges. Dawned a break, and disposed the previous ways into that not like this arena. Rehearsing the transition rarely finds the path so imagined. Broken cogs of emotional attachment and be muddled trueness. Argued into a corner by reality unseen. Dragged the nails one more time at the board, just to see the clinch. Dirty manoeuvres in a process deemed equal become dirtier than most. Sadness befalls the choices, weakness concludes all the wrong things. Moved away not towards and found the biggest kind of gulf. Shaken mirror into pieces where no reflection can even be seen. Raining chards come on like knives to the suddenly thrown in. Reality bites, and so do I if I'm being attacked by teeth. Viciously venomous to the idea of what is or is not. Steps in the wilds of a minefield tend to take off whole limbs at a time. Left without breath and speechless. Sometime it will be nothing but daylight. Sometimes. </p>"

Transitions in the blind trust of not knowing someone else's seaworthiness. Paddled up, creeks turned rivers. Out into the open see. Third eyes floating about in the surrounding ether, should draw spiraled parallels. Horizons in the blink, turn to outbursting colours of promise and hard work. In the eventful and usual tendency for disarray. Harmonically bound into this never forward, because all around is so wondrous. Alice never had this much trouble figuring out her land, as cracked as it was. To rabbit? To find a hole upward? Up is relative when the light blinds and the darkness baffles. Changing into this flop forward with wheels turned into high roads, for penance finds solitude and reflection. All this pain, is an illusion. As the escalated visceral attempt at rising falls flat, the reckoned must change. At this point in the venture, crazy jumpings out of planes on fire, one should be willing to know how to land. Landing upon a dinghy to find a new way to thrust onward to ""that"" direction. Much digging, for light to find my brow. Healthy nots, are the blinded tradeoff of sufferance for return. New ages find a career of skills onward, to allow for less time required in the bargain. Freedom is when your time doesn't need to be earned for the cost of it all. Routinely found on the rocks of a grinding like schedule which precludes all forms of freeness or joy alike. Continued abatement of the needs of whole sections, compound the resonating issues into downward spirals. My offspring hate me because I ""provide,"" but lack all forms of time to enjoy those shared provisions. Money doesn't connect, it only standardizes time. What trades can be made follow what people without know, decide to construct or need. Concentrated sufferance for a bigger tail to facilitate that growth and achievement, can breed much heavier balances of time. Addled with large vestiges bottled up and chalked away into time you wish you had back, but were forced in growth to give up. Green thumbs are patient thumbs indeed."

"event","What have you done with...? In the sacrifice play of this action to better yourself? This socalled growth always? Analyzing roots and the creatures and comforts found within, usually beget a darker depth of why you haven't ""groaned"", yet. This chore of digging in upwardly directions, the light of day being a better horizon in some faucets, and a much lesser, in others. Waxing upon that ski down some further slopes, is how the upward direction becomes due. Carved madly a new track, only to venture the hill back summited. Pause in one's ascent, is dutiful in that perspective of the ridge, becomes soulful upon standing ontop. Invasion is the only way to spread. When boundaries have solidified into walls, and trappings lace the approach, a failed attempt perpetually is the expected. Differing is underlying to reality. For one vision has no means of checking itself. This new angle, with all stoppings and restartings also drives hard bargains."

Foxholes be the survival strategy. Are we actually at war? Hey buddy. Yeah. ""Hey sweety? "" What are we fighting about anyhow? Funny, when a grenade shows up, you don't much care or bother to think about who fired the first shot. You either hurl it back. Or, take the boom and then hurl whatever you can find to hurt, and lob your own version of the ""truth"" down the other's foxy hole. Somehow the understanding is pinned down under the wire, while the mortars prevent reinforcements or the medic. It's almost comedy, if it weren't such a realistic tragedy. Over the top become a new coping method when the hole you're in fills with schmuck. When care packages become laced with cyanide. Designed to cripple, designed to maintain the hurt. The battle must be waged. The conflict must be resolved. Wait. We're fighting about why we are fighting. That's a tad foolish to the grunt in the mud. Just doesn't matter so much, will suck the will to fight beyond out of you. Comfort being a place that makes sense. A place willing and worthy of the understood. Upwards, downwards. Spiralling journeys usually don't go both ways at once when partners be such and so opposed. Perpetually, it seems.
Truth should be ever evolving. That is the real battle."

As the water is begone from this fish like state, that shallow pool currently treading within seems always smaller. While options sink to nothing within those murky placid depths. Is this time frame yet to be discovered? Or merely, yet to be played out. Scratching endlessly at the heresay of some other persons' words. Doubt cracks the noble keel of this lifeboat upon a pond. Swimming seems so much more wet, but so much more necessary as the ship has lost its rudder, in one more dance upon reason. Caverns within that plotted course. To be taken to whilst that squabble makes it's way to hitting the floor or bottom. With few and far things left to reach out at and to, the horizon speaks, no smacks, of all we'll never be. Creative outreaches find arms sticking out of train cars, waiting for the turn to disembark in no man's land. What now I wonder? What ever becomes of this step? Solid ground and boats have a very love/hate relationship. For sailing is not to be taken upon by fools when seas become tumultuous. Conversing in the first upon the oceans of thoughts and meanings, is suffered for its vastness and many rocks to find. Another row boat turned ocean liner in one's own mind. Working the oars can find water smoothly or backs of heads sharply depending on the ability to work together. Lost into hurricanes while bickering over who is holding which oar. Subtlety is a luxury when things have been stretched by avoidance. Critical limits require critical thinking. The coin flip feeling like a seriously moot point. Jagged constructs, hardly divested. Is the trigger not mine to pull? Would I have it pulled upon me? Time. Will tell all spoils, eventually. No guideline, no recourse, seems to be head strung out and waiting for the choice to be detonated. Who loses in such tender traps, where withered means come to effect after the snare has tightened beyond escape. Is the burden so atmospheric that it cannot clear the air enough to mutuality? It's uphill, and both ways, more often than not. Is trying compulsory? I beg not. Is trying proactive ultimately? I wonder ceaselessly. 

No surety within the befuddled mind of someone who chooses not to look that inward. Broken record upon a broken record player."

Go too deep and lose the heard word, skim the surface and fail to know the river at all. All the while a dragonfly stares me down, wishing for those reeds once again.

Casual nods becoming reasons to crease the paper differently all the sudden. Whistling out the form soon pressed into another flat angle simply floating down the river.

As a spiral finds a tangent lost to it's turn, and the direction must yield to the ever outward and better. The attack upon an idea is a less worse fate than being overlooked the opportunity to avoid failure whilst building upon a previously unseen fault line. An unknown becoming known says little about the originator, if the idea evolves and pursues success with less haste. The fault only falls down around as the idea crumbles when obstacles become of pride, and beget crumbling of the idea for an inability to adjust reality's sense. When building into fog, robust approaches require the perceptions of as many as can be had. Disappearing lines in the blur of what makes sense in it all, as the heading refuses to adjust in titanic ice bound determinations. Touching the success while it owns you, fleets away the true value in the journey to that higher grounding in aspects which account for the more views. As the weighs check into the balances and a piece is found to be in dispute, would a true calling of the tune or world become absolute? So much in the visualization of a point in space in time which lies as yet to be fully determined.

If Columbus would have been arrested for insanity, would the new world have been so&nbsp;colonized?&nbsp;Galileo was imprisoned for pondering and finding an answer to a question of a fundamentally held truth. Did throwing him in jail prevent the world from not being the center of the universe? or were assumptions not to be questioned because of the distaste for the evolution of an idea?&nbsp;Investment in the previous causes efforts to be squandered for the sake of maintaining the status of quo, while progress towards a better reality becomes a victim to those that would not yield to a less flawed model. Compelled towards a deader end with a blindness of convention which paralyzes sense, and closes the angle of sight to only the most compulsive notions. Whipping a horse who is tied up backwards does not make the cart move forward any quicker. Engineered disasters become a tale of oversight, which explains why such intensive testing carries to results which are worth the expensive and labour to build. Taking the time to build a square wheel only shows one's inability to understand the concept of rolling.

So many thoughts, ideas, and directions on the horizon, it's a wonder dizziness hasn't set in while I attempt to figure out which stride and direction makes sense in the most auspicious ways. Never mind the fact that opportunity cannot be made from doors which are not opened. Slugging along in the trench to find the door which is open, even if it is only a slight crack, I will make that place become all it will be. Flagging a line to a trail you would not see makes for a better explorer, but less for accomplished distance upon a known heading. Making a map isn't about the distance away from a point which is seen, but how all the points beyond that point are seen.

Happy map making folks. Don't get caught in the faults. Find the summits where ever they stand."

Causing all angles to explore simultaneously into the apex of each and every aspect of serene impermanence. Called to it, like an air raid, covering to be survived.

Or does the climb and the scent become the adventure turned upside down and right side back up again? Carried by craziness along the&nbsp;parallels&nbsp;only to find that I alone murdered me. Stopped it, like a locked up transmission in the wrong lane and gear of life, smoking the rubber into painted lines of dismay. Found a ditch only to sleep at the stars and ponder my existence just one more night alone, in the coolness of that brisk insanity. Turned by it all the loops can only find the bitter fruit in that shallow grave of misaligned yield signs. Pointing their ways to form a never ending loop of slower and faster but no where in between, and seeing no other sights but that same old right hand turn. &quot;Either it'll move me, or it will move right through me.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Courage certainly couldn't come at a worse time.&quot; Would that arm twisting, own my charmed sake?<br /><br />Bringing the wind to the valley does not change the river's flow. But without the river the wind would have no earthen channel to sculpt and be guided by. Like a bird's eye in the soaring graces of those cliff side photographs, mixing in the eddys like a frothing mass of emotion in a timeless vortex of the perpetually misunderstood. Containing the thoughts becomes a broken wheel holding back the damn, while the rains continue to fill the reservoir. The gear becomes up, and the landing becomes tortured. While the moon gains in the sights to become the next stop, and the airless worry of that vacuum state, leaves me breathless. Demented into the dream of finding another world, only to fall to the earth in a tailspin as the engines stall out from the last gasp of the flightless atmosphere. &quot;Don't you lock up, something that you wanted to see fly!&quot;<br /><br />I don't have the first clue in this ice flow of humanity turned voyage. Is there a melt or a breakup in the water to clear the shipping channel. The fog horn sounds, like a dirty rumble in the blanket of mist to echo a sentiment of the churning water underneath the frozen wastes. Where's my wheels and my road? The miles need to turn. And my ears need to hear those sounds to cause the pedals and the pavement to be beaten while my body screams in the exhaustion of that burn out ride. It's been so incredibly too long!!!<br /><br />Peace.<br /><br />Little Bones can cause so much&nbsp;havoc for Gus...<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""143""/>"

What becomes acceptable to you and others are the planks of the bridge, and the unaccepted becomes the rocks which build up the canyon walls. In this landscape of hills, valleys, and crossings, the boundaries usually are drawn based on the map itself. So what is to be done when in undiscovered country? Where no map exists. Charmed between those sight lines, while the transit stares down the views to mark it all across. Checking the level is a stage which becomes necessary with every step, and throw. Casting the bricks in the footings of supporting pylons only serves to make for planks which are not subject to change. Sometimes the world will rock the foundations, and the winds will blow the deck boards all over the friggin' place. But in the haze of the after storm, a bridge which has&nbsp;accommodation&nbsp;built in will last through the trials of canyon's shifting. Looking above the horizon to a distant plane clipping through the clouds accomplishes nothing towards the bridge, but never looking up will cause a loss of sight on the direction of the bridge at hand.

Agreement in feeling or opinion; accord

Finding things in similarity, and having an agreement&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;to you, become the basis of moving forward in most arenas. A cloud of varying thoughts usually&nbsp;preproses to have&nbsp;a meaning beyond the sum of it's parts, and a direction in most degrees at any given time. The consideration of the factors that would bring things closer or further, to and from harmony, become the dynamic cases of which ways should be undertaken. If things become less so clear in that cloud turned fog, does intuition form the difference? Can the dream and presumption really shake out a causality in the absence of information? Proven facts have never totally been a prerequisite for moving forward, and abandonment of a ship has certainly&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;in the absence of imminent sinking. Potential difference can measure the energy required to bridge a gap, now what differences are present? Would the unlikely be any less of a possibility than say the overwhelmingly obvious? The factors which make that possibility work are the true points worth noting. Statistics show historical understandings of past trends, not actual current proceedings, or potentials beyond the horizon. Uncertainty shows that the very act of observation alters that which you would observe. I have found this personally with a simple glance being caught, and the resulting innuendo of fact versus presumption which ensues. Seeing something in it's own light only to find that it's light changes when it is aware it is being watched. Orbiting the possibilities becomes more about understanding the orbits, than the bodies which do find themselves entangled. Entanglement is not a bad thing, for it yields interesting interactions which form cause and effect chains that cannot help but alter those bodies after the fact of the moment. The energy created by these entangling's, drives outward beyond that moment and those orbits become awkward, and distanced, or locked and close. All signs point to awkward and distanced being the prevailing function in that relationship. The gap which relies on potentiality to be overcome hinges upon the knowing of those orbits and energies to understand if they shall become closer. Forces of attractions, and the subsequent laws which guide those forces seem on the face to be solid, but unexpected events can always provide for outliers which seem to break the convention. Being unconventional, I find things which buck convention to be highly attractive and sensual to my understandings. Would those outliers make themselves understood and professed, or will obscurity be the overriding notion in this space.&nbsp;Time is the only factor which will yield that answer. And as it all stands, time has yet to truly tick on..."

Sucked into that place like a vortex to an alternate universe I am spent in my ability to resist it. An intrigued&nbsp;eye turns around the room and develops the images of that scene to discern the new meaning of it all. Locked upon but a small degree of that landscape in the breathtaking respite of her form so captivating and surreal,&nbsp;everything else seems meaningless. Peace and&nbsp;tranquility&nbsp;are mixed with nervousness for that moment will end, and failing to inspire another seems like a fate worse than death. Comfort ferments and the wine pleases the senses to a chord of resonance which only suits a sweet heading and vantage. Distanced in the time otherwise, I look for a trap door to change it all. Somehow in the blindness the morning switches me into opposing modes. Like fleeting rays of the sun, once in a day, the light shines to seem like a new day, only to slip back into the same twilight of another track. Finding the high ground amounts to being in eclipse of the notion which would be without that high. Does it exist beyond that altered state? To find the trajectory which takes a course through all the colours of the day is the holy grail, but in a quest that has no map or commission, it finds nothing in it's wake. An enigma to be puzzled over, and&nbsp;perplexed by even the simplest of things, I cannot say my mind doesn't spin upon that dime repeatedly.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""135""/><br /><br />Unrelated... but a nice little new song.<br /><lj-embed id=""136""/>"

Channeled into some application of science which tapers my guides into the sleeves of experiences which cap the housing of my life. Rolled over in the race to find that revolution in thy self, and hopefully clear the friction which could destroy the parts. Covering the pieces over and over with a clean view to sort out the process and isolate the blue marks which show the&nbsp;marring&nbsp;in the surfaces. I scrape at the edges which misalign my heading and my bearing. The compass sorts the views and recorded orders, and the direction yields to the options which could be or would not be true. Warming to the fit of less boring devices and pressing things which don't intrinsically mate becomes the order of the day.&nbsp;Is pressure the measure of a positive application? Or a value to be avoided in those low keyed versions of a story in the throws? Radially pointing in all directions at once, the load only sits with one element in hand at any given time. Wear in the turn must be checked and failure is the result of complacence. The joints and the crushed shells somehow create a discomfort in the fit when things haven't been chamfered to allow for the slide. Bushing through the whacks to find that trail which until recently wasn't even seen, let alone felt in that rotation. Stationary elements in the pivoting responses to thrust holds parts at bay, but with consequences to the surface beyond the un-lubricated grooves. Cracks in the liner begin to show where the guide is not in the appropriate position. Separation of the elements can allow different races to be run effectively, but only for so long, and only under the right conditions and tolerances. Sealed components and shielded internals become truth in the installation of the elements. The weight must be factored with all choices and can destroy a poorly&nbsp;chosen&nbsp;part. Writing in code helps me in my decisions, at least in the idea of understanding what things are and look like after the fact. The blocks at the pillow level speak volumes or deafen with the silence, but are so crucial to the fabric of the instrument that we cannot pretend they are not a part with play. The best way to maintain the split is to keep things clean, and always protect that which is liable to be contaminated. So what floats? What must be fixed? How will things change in this, and after this? These and other questions which cause the hoops to be formed in the process of pursuing that heading through those bearings.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""132""/>"

"event","Complicated bio-chemical responses in the body and mind play all sorts of&nbsp;havoc with the reality of the everyday dazes. The words begin and end with thoughts driven out from the love of something or someone. Casting a form by the eye, and breathing a sense in from another presence blinds rational thought from the equation. A fire stoked by figments while the noise flushes out the signal to distracted levels. Wick away the truth and distill out the simple in that timeless moment of emotion. Love begets all sorts of strong notions within the mind, but in it's root it is a decision without thought. Mutuality and frames of varying requitedness can contort a soul against it's own grain with maddening like speed and intensity. Knowing can be an answer, but not knowing is what gives the game it's suspense and compulsion. The balance between the understood and the seemingly unfavoured, drives wedges across all sounds of divides. Would you profess that which lies heavy on a heart, knowing full well that the feeling comes from everywhere else but the beating organ? Caught flight on occasion while the drum like&nbsp;rhythm accelerated in that presence which so consumes. Somehow becoming almost superhuman in my supposed self perception. The caveat usually falls with that jaded eye which cannot actually tell when one is being utterly foolish, or immeasurably cool. Would be nice if we all walked around with radiation detecting like badges which&nbsp;gaged our swave levels by the second. Would that spoil the game? Or would it merely make for an obvious way to pursue things which made sense versus made absolute no sense? All those first dates which have been rendered pointless on account of one deal breaking detail between things. Foretelling would be nice. But careful what you wish for.<br /><br />Refusals and other coynesses are always the evils of the process, no matter how well you think you might know or fit with someone. Drips in the light, that either fill a cup, or empty it slowly. Splashing in that pool of fervour the mind can and will travel at break neck speeds to consider it's goal, and try to understand it's obstacles. To the best of it's ability as per always. Is that ability something which is inborn within someone to begin with? Or is it a power which is rechargeable like a battery? Strength always has a bad way of fleeing from the knees when it truly matters. Strong matters bending willpower, and cracking open notions which either were considered or not, but still carry gravity beyond that which seems to be walkable under. Crippled in the throws before things would/could settle into that groove of obvious fitting between two souls, if that ever does even transpire. Again, the knowing problem goes right for the nads and leaves so many speechless and pained. Not again... &nbsp;Oh well, live to love again. Small solace to a soul who's back seems emotionally broken with a simple word, or even worse, that lack of word(s). Hold thy breath... This might take awhile, but some things are worth the patience, and others are just not exactly rapid starters. Time tends to always tell. Cheers!<br /><br />I propose a more simple solution...<br /><p>Everybody should just say what ever is on their mind, good or bad, give or take, in or out, sweet or sour, etc.<br />No harm in knowing. However, plenty of opportunity for shite in the not knowing.<br /><br />Funny how the playground antics yielded to a bigger playground, and a larger pool of resources to get up to a larger list of possible options. In the end... It's the same damn game. Seemingly with cooties and all! Some advice for all you would be &quot;Rico Suave's&quot; out there.<br />Just be what is, and see it for what it is, isn't, can be, or can't be. It's just that simple!</p><br />A total retro recall.

Dripping down past the things which may or may not be, seen, known, or felt. Coming this far in that twist holds the truth dear, and fills the sails with some gusts to find that promised land in those arms. Roping onto the dock and cutting the lines will separate the decision on the heading to be yet told. Cargo in this life is but a drag on the levels of exploration which can be sought.

Losing yourself to the flow of catch's which entangle and embody the wholeness of moments embraced with utter joys. Way over yonder a whisper begins it's venture in the shared light of a morning glow. Do those dreams shape reality as they shake loose within the unexpected? Enchanted by callings and eyes to become bewildered while on a course I once thought true. Distance in those lost causes is unavoidable, more dramatic so with information being a sparse share. Not knowing what the wet finger to the sky will yield as far as a direction goes, makes the random seem like the choice to pursue. Found a reef? Perhaps. Found solace? Always in some fashion.

The rabbit whole certainly awaits... Your communication and understanding level will thank you for it.<br /><br /><p>It seems to me that so many people avoid the knowledge and understanding bases that underpin the ways we approach perceiving the world. Unfortunately, they do so at their own peril. The intricate details which are entangled within the messages we receive and transmit, throughout the almost infinite variety of moments, become somehow lost in the noise that ignorance creates. An ear which cannot discern between different audible tones, is hearing impared. A mind which cannot discern between different angles of understanding is unaware. Is lack of awareness a crime? Depends on the level of responsibility which is carried by the act and/or knowledge vested upon someone's understanding. Do you hold or carry a notion of value? How is that value created to begin with? The importance in the&nbsp;multitudes of constructs becomes a flea market of the psyche, without deciding what you're shopping for in advance. What is taken away becomes a function of the logical understood outcomes which have been pondered as far out as reality would allow in that instance. How far does your view of reality extend? The idea fo whether something is valid or not is solely based on the notion of whether factors exist beyond the realm of consideration. If you believe the earth to be the center of the universe, without objectively studying as many of the bodies in the universe as you can, then you might just find that a conviction or belief falls when a body forces itself to be seen. Unfortunately it didn't work out so well for Galileo... Try to ask why that flawed idea was so worth hanging onto? What was honestly on the table to be lost when compared against the notion of having less understanding? Power and control tend to fight understanding in the most unholy of ways throughout time.

The strokes of conviction storm across that divide and draw forever lines in the sands while the hour glass turns. Slowly, grain by grain, emptying into the grate of wasted and gone. A chipped and half full glass tells no time worth knowing. The blood in the hour seeps the window shut on the growth to exclude those sights which jive with the curtains hung. Like foregone conclusions the&nbsp;judgments&nbsp;presumed to be known long before the race has even been stretched for. Void of hate in that choir of insult to the face of life yet to shine, the streaks become etched into the pane. Draining through those cracks a simple &quot;yes, I saw it,&quot; becomes the echoes of relation sunk before the ship's potential bow has turned, long into the iceberg. Days away from an experience ruled out as somehow against a persona built upon the house of cards labeled as &quot;understanding.&quot; 360&deg;=21,600'=1,296,000&quot;. If there are over a million seconds in a circle how could you pretend to know even an&nbsp;infinitesimal amount of that scope. Quiting the mountain before you even find the base is a sure way to not climb anything. Despite there being more than one mountain to climb in this collection of human psyches. We all leave things in the dusts of the sand we try to squeeze back into the glass. Hoping one day to circle round back again and see a tangent, to develop a reason why or why not. The answers form in the bubble of the position which is current, and can only divide a slight notion of the mind at another moment. Losing sight of this difference allows the snake to blind the eyes like the reverse of a snake charmer being lost in his muse. Lulled into the sense of composure in a hurricane of altered reality. We cannot witness the world falling apart with our eyes wide shut. That single moment can change everything, like a fracture chasing all hope into the future shattering any connections which most certainly would come to define us without even realizing it until well after. Settling against a line which draws itself out for reasons serving thy self, cages a nature to repulse a relation of the essential mundane blocks of everything also. The reaches blind all things from the growth which is only useful when unexpected and unassumed. Slowly killing all things like shading a sun loving plant to prevent it from burning... The weakness creates the destruction because it cannot be contained without a will to understand why it is weak. Fear will guide in only one direction...<br />Do not fear life, for it is the only way to live.<br />Cheers to all who know and embrace that!<br /><br />Been awhile since I wrote something more raw. enjoy.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""116""/><lj-embed id=""121""/><br />"

Is it crossable or does it simply demarcate the lines by which we can and cannot travel along paths?<br /><br />The ever changing sight lines of those edges, with their deceptive callings of sanctity and elements of respite. Needing help and permission to become something, turns that something into a product of another, and less of yourself. Sweeping changes become the entrance into lands which speak to different horizons, and see through altered eyes. Vulnerable enough to accept those thoughts which guide me into the nethers of change, and the unknown. Called by things in the wastes of unexpected openness to celebrate the opportunities born in those never seen or felt before things. Everything pushes toward or away from something or other, like a tide bringing us all to the fresh water which we cannot find on our compass. Lost worlds of intrigue and amazement that would pass beside us like a silent ship in the night. Challenging the reflections as the optics distort the vision within the moments of bewildered&nbsp;transcendence. The&nbsp;impermanence of this life and any other is natural to it's cause, and blind to it's ultimate outcome. The very moment we become aware of the impending end, we have already found ourselves half way over the ledge. Falling soundly into the new oblivion which is the next momentous experience outward in the traverse across our paths. Crossing and colliding in the unusualness of the connections we seemingly&nbsp;take for granted for all the things they could bring us to. Feeling alive when the scent holds you down to the trace, and you are compelled to pursue. Weaving within the lines of that vision which bewitched a moment in time, to spin the threads out into the image of that moment extended. Can string bare the strain of two moments heading in two different directions? What ever would that tapestry look like if the design were to be torn further into it's weave? Communication bangs that drum, as a silent beat steals the light from the bulb of thought while the sleeping dog lies. That peaceful nirvana&nbsp;up heaved in the cold waking hours of that translucent place between dreams and foretold realities. Striking out past the foretold to become what is to be. The light rises a sunken soul from the depths of something into that surfaced light and radiance applies to the burst with which energy can now come. Like a supernova in the mind the awakening is hardly calm, but nor is it violent, it can be destructive of so many falsehoods so that a peeling of the skin will endure into a new form of you. Push out, past what has become the weathered skin of all that is assumed in your everyday. The whole world awaits your wakening!<br /><br />There is far too much in you to deny what is but the nature calling into the void with it's siren song of being.<br />I am. I will be.

A folk tune which has been morphed and adapted over the years to the styles of those who chose to play it. The height of the&nbsp;notoriety probably came with The Animals bringing it to mainstream hit status back in the mid 60's.

Chills find the rugged souls in the cold lights of mornings beyond the living grave. What would we have done in the eyes of yesterday to prevent today? Thoughts provoke in all directions while the drum beats the future forward, and the fallouts bring with it sweet rains of reality,&nbsp;consequentially&nbsp;stitching the fabrics of our lives as we live them. Casted reels of fishings and films litter the streets as the night became something else from the shadows womb. Would the ability of hindsight change our lives to breed some &quot;better way&quot; or do the experiences make us so definitively, that we could no more abandon them as our own bodies? Racking against the walls and tripping amongst the floor boards to find bars and chains guiding the world now. Is the shocking truth the actuality that we all have our mix ups and mess ups? But somehow carry forth with the worth that we have stepped through something, and seen the world anew from yet another angle for yet another reason. Risk and reward causes so much in the way of spiraling outwards, I would liken those forces to gravity and air. Can be no more sure of the air we breathe than the things we say, and the things which will play out as each breath is drawn and each word is spoke.<br /><br />I have seen the sun.

Vacant in some, completely there in others, moments yo-yo back and forth between appearing meaningless and crucial.

Girls wanting my hair for it's waviness and I didn't bother at all with my hair. Envy from all arounds... But the fitting in part was supremely elusive. And that in itself was what formed me so much more than anything else. Grunge felt like a growth ring which allowed my tree to find it's own roots. I emerged profoundly more grounded having been steered by something which felt right to not be a part of everything else. The significance of those years will never erode and the songs strike reminders of how I still embody those foundations in my thoughts.<br /><br />States of love and trust in the people, we meet, know, will meet, will know, have met, have known, and everyone else at large who indirectly will play a role in our lives, can't always be expected or taken for granted. The factors that shape us are so vast and one can never truly grasp all the angles. Figuring them out past the markers and understanding the gravity while we orbit those changes becomes the best hope.

Driving against the rain and wind only to see the lines disappear beneath the sweat and exhaustion. Climbing into the thermocline with all the fervour of a bird in first flight. Petrified against the grains of choices, and paths in the longing road. Dazed by the backdrop of those veils as the gears turn out the miles, and the thoughts wind across the sun stained road. Can be quite strange how the weather does travel with you sometimes, and the speed at which seasons can change in the blink of an eye, all within a single day.<br /><br />Risking the neck towards the window frame, like unexplained things which float in and out of this crowded house. Expecting all the things which never turn up only to be pleasantly surprised by the wondrous things which unexpectedly do. The pain and comfort of the long roads which are riddled or vacant to turnoffs in seemingly random succession, become markers for some life which unfolds in such eclectic ways. Would you presume to understand the riddle before it is told? Like a cube spinning on all axis, the prediction model is a puzzle without a picture to assemble it by. Measuring the deluge in a paper cup is the&nbsp;caffeinated&nbsp;obtuse notion of an obsession to the passing gulps of delusion. Is the sleet going to cause a slip in the turn? Is the map going to lead me astray? Wildly unaware of the road ahead, and yet somehow calmed by the faucets of difference which have yet to shake themselves into the mix. Is this all there is? I highly doubt the contorts of change have finished working my soul over the rocks and high upon the summits yet. Temptation feels the mountain top against all natural odds, and failing is the vast destruction of flawed preconceived notions. This in itself becomes the growth to cause a shed of what has only fit so well, and lingered long in the hanging. Scratched windows when the peering into a soul becomes by the dull light of a late night which was woken too early. Wide and starry are the eyes when under a spell of morning glory, and a fresh new look upon the sunrise creeping in through the window. Is this a morning for a boot on the wheel, or a time to be strapped to the wheel and rolled across your life? Having to say the sky becomes blue begets the looking upwards, and follows conventional logic until proven otherwise. The rain dries in the wee hours and a fresh day calls out in new directions.

I am complicated... I will find a center. Bringing upwards and downwards the lines to cater a moment into that comfort, I would&nbsp;falter&nbsp;in that search. Skews of vision decide the angles by which to draw the lines of picturesque deciding. Incisions drive harsh notes upon the leaves of the tree, shaken wildly by&nbsp;endeavourings of mental leanings.

Flinching while the air is crisp and knotted by opportunities. Blind to what ventures in the wilderness and yet somehow born into the hunt. Knocked down and running in the race of a rolling trick.

Sucked into the figment as if it could be gotten back, but lost to the everyday of the incapability. Easy to get lost in that maze of platitudes, which are generated by a&nbsp;soulless&nbsp;wanting of something which seemingly cannot be had. Patience lying under the vale in the virtues I cannot hold onto, and the arcs drawn between no specific points. Wandering into that wondering, the stumbling suffocation of the mindset lost to it's own demise is terrifying. Could I possibly envision any more? Certainly things which would never be or have been. With no leg to walk on, my crutch is merely a flag pole for the pulpit I try to expose and maintain in this trite effort of public discourse. I have found that temporary sanity, but like a dream catcher it oscillates my wantings in the light of days trapped behind glass. Rose colourings make for a day long in the torment, and recourse seems little option. Precious little becomes welcoming in the combing of my mental widgets on the factory floor.

Creatures roam in the verses of ideals changing like winds in a dust storm. Once having seen through infant like eyes I can only count to my years worth the forms I have taken. The numbers race through the looking glass with astounding speed and the twists cause reflections to become fool hardy in that&nbsp;kaleidoscopic vision. Peering into those verses with an ounce of prose and a hope for poise. The fathoms come back with lost echoes from the void, for insane apes find little in reflected vision between each other. Feeling the cause overcome the barrier to entry and the boom lowers slowly upon the heavens that may come. The sight fails in that felt universe with mystifying definitions of the worlds around us. Can we possibly even try to describe the things we have not seen or felt? Connecting would be parallels with frayed rope, trying to tether them into our fabrics and hopefully weave a blanket to hide under. The light surely burns all forms of fabric to whithering states when hidden from. Truth can no more be avoided than the plague. Eventually the skin will break and the world will swarm into the unsuspecting and unprepared. Having not been there, I could&nbsp;neither&nbsp;understand nor endorse the &quot;duck and cover&quot; approach to what amounts to a mushroom cloud of awareness within a split second. Hiding to the lives we lead and live is never an answer to the questions springing eternally from the turns in the shell. Weather changing brings about new days to feel breezes from strange lands blowing high upon the horizon. The patterns emerge in ways within the wines, sipping back a bottle of truth in the converse. Labeled into a pigeon hole, we could fly amongst the park benches and see the stools from the ground up. Prophets aligning around the legs to drink in the vapours of&nbsp;inquisition. Sleeping in the hollows of a day off from the snowy landscape of another blizzard of misunderstanding. Clever retorts become the back hoe to dig one's own grave in the time spent between answers. Digging up finds another hole born in the&nbsp;pondering's. The light fades in the sine back down into the antinodal&nbsp;farce&nbsp;while I visit the image from the outside. Staring back at the once myself, leaving the plethora of others in the dusts of the winds scattered. Inversely serving the wicked and spiking the possibilities with hope in the vacuum of multitudes. Occupying spaces beyond the one I lie in, becomes a phase which cannot be sustained. Doubt bleeds the outcome from the horizon and slithers away from ventures unknown. Pining in that list, the ship and harbour could be no further apart. Compass standing in place as the boat whirls around on anchorage and takes water on and off as an&nbsp;oscillating&nbsp;reality becomes half full and empty, in a harmonic&nbsp;resonance. Ego's dance and realities are strewn across the battle field as casualties of thoughts beyond the scope. Is any of this a solution to a madness which is half pregnant?

Even though it has barely been a moment in time since.<br /><br />Some thoughts I might try to formulate with that and another 40+ year old tune based on a mention of Neil Young earlier today.<br /><br />In the flames turned to ashes we carry through the water, past the rubble of something yesterday. Is the time between...? Spent in a daze? Wondering where the relation would and when, come or go? Speaking softly in whispers with levels of dizzyingly pragmatic avoidance. Head turnings and evenings bow to the stretches of reasoning and ... Is the complication always the same in the face of those perceived round and square pegs and holes? Sifting into the bits which hide amongst the grains of sand locked in the glass, we could always try to call the tunes for what they are or are not. Places with signs speak the loudest in the gaps of what is known and not. Finding the way with a fold out map clawed away by some animal in a tirade, then trying to bushwhack out of that wilderness and find it again on another day. While tripping into the graces of the unexpected, the questions spring forth like drops in a fountain. Water beating against a wall where the streams of intrigue meet with much of... the without. Strings of sound begin a respite from the would be pearls of prose, which fall into and upon flatness by that beautiful face. Thinking into a spiral the turning becomes nauseating when I catch a breath to see that the needle hasn't moved. Still sitting in the box of tricks which lies unopened and seemingly unconsidered. Pulling the teeth with the sheltered friendliness to bemuse a softness from the well meanings. Means to an ends have funny ways of ending, tripping hazards notwithstanding. Within the strangeness a birth of sorts, rocketing a sense into that new light. Cold to the shinning in the afterglow of somethings. Next and newness of steps becomes the long ladder of climbing upon broken rungs. Paying prices unbeknown to me, I cannot fathom what the divide would cost, or how to save them pennies to find it again. Willing and wanting can be mutually exclusive notions in worlds which lie separate. Bridging from only one side will surely find fault and bring supports crumpling down upon a would be solo bridge maker. Does this road cross this canyon, or is the long treacherous cliff side road the only way to proceed? Would that I know of the how's, and if's that constitute the world surrounding me, and what lay in store for my longings. Knowing the future would only make the present seem meaningless.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""96""/>"

Crossing the divide like the center line on a drunken drive through the country. Seemingly unaware of the miles placed upon the hubcaps. Is the speedometer really reading negative numbers again? Practicing parking while in fifth gear is a rather foolish&nbsp;maneuver. So which road does this window peer out towards anyhow? The bleeding highway, a park lane, that country road to nowhere but somehow everywhere at the same time. Like pylons the moments slowly fall down as the driving test is failed using nothing more than a cracked mirror and a gut feeling to find the spot. The frame tells me the size of the&nbsp;up swell&nbsp;and I become rocked by the jig and reel of those songs which dance to tunes of another place. Stories told in the throws become tales of launched notions, outer space not being a habitable location for much time. Harsh groundings meet the unexpected loss of sanction in that lurch. Stepping on the spare tire and pinching the fingers in the window while trying to climb out through it at 80 clicks. Tread streaks upon the glass while the car rolls and the sounds speak of a new direction. Screeching into the oblivion with depths never ending. Was that a fence we just drove through?<br /><br />Is the yard such an open place as to play with out structure until a child's heart is but merely content? Certainly not a parking space at any rate...<br /><br />The view becomes the frame and the sight lines are partially blocked while the noise shakes the curtains towards inducing blindness. The tunnel yields to that train, and the whistle screams of nothing but the loss. Rain is an equalizer of sorts, and can purge the confusion away like a shower for the dirty. Whether you continue to play in the dirt becomes the game or the highlight. Scoring those events requires both parties to know what the field looks like. I distinctly recall us saying we were going to play soccer and you show up with a baseball bat...? What the fuck! This game gets sickening when the net disappears and someone takes the ball home... Although field sports in the mud when it's nice and warm can be quite the laugh for sure! Having found myself in some measure of pain recently I can only sit with a nose pressed against the glass hoping for a day when the field isn't so wounding.

Affecting us like bodies pulled towards those things which center and burn us alike. Overwhelmed in the falling to continue driving away. Propelled outward and never distancing the gaps between the entities in the midst. Tail in hand, surrendering to the force of being lost and weary. Is it a new branch which could change the cycle of ever revolving creatureness, and cause shifts in all realms of real. Distracted in the moments between course corrections to find myself on the heading laid out as if it was fate. Such simple things in the wishings of those tragic creations outside of the lines. Pushing the nexus to new heights beyond even my own reach, while threading the needle in loops of ever entangled not's. Cutting rope is akin to choking by one's own umbilical. Solace launching away at light speed far past the visions which could contain it. Release is an ejection of things which hold ground. Footsteps trying to cling to the moon without any weight. Is life a floating orb in the back of my mind while I sleep away the moments of this ever changing reality? Feeling into the darkness like a child blinded by his own haste. Getting a leg up on one's own monster is no better odds than Frankenstein's own fate. Shocking truth to a world which spins on an axis ever changing.

Like a bristling vague flashback which found the moment in a shiftedness of time. Between the way back when and the right here and now things took a shape which was overwhelming in that moment. Consuming and humbling if nothing else. I bet the sloshed mindset didn't hurt either, but frames in time and places do come in heavily unexpected ways. When you have an overflowing emotion, you should put it to something deviant like a song. Won't be writing my own song anytime soon, but at least I can write with a partner in sound. Here goes...<br /><br />Staying awake while falling becomes the dream within a downfall. Slipping through the fingers like oil squeezed out of a handful of sand. Creating corners in that solution while spinning the bottle top. Creeping about in the mushy middle, lying in wait for something. Chasing what amounts or appears to be a figment of a life less ordinary. The changing in that resolve is an everest of all things distinctly unknown. Looking for cause seems to disregard the here and now at the cost of stalling underneath a lift bridge. Depths of unknown contemplation seldom yields results of a more calming nature. Distressing at the very least. Horrifying at the very worst. Disruption can be a force of creation as much as destruction. Is keeping yourself away from yourself the answer? Does this cap the well and bridge the gulf? Or divide the evidence of what we all should become as a matter of being? Beneath the skin skeletons try to walk in different strides upon the earth of possibly the same choosing. Supernatural forces can shake a room, with or within the states of minds that occupy that room. Lost to the sands of time, tied up in the oil flowing beyond that reach. Viewing understanding like a stained glass window view of a sunset. Spinning inside the bottle becomes a choice of only one choosing. Breaking the bottle could risk flying apart at all seams. Beating the drum beckons a demon into the nethers of the unknown and unexpected. Do we dance the tribal, row the boat, or lull to a false sense and hope for the best. Sneaking past the complacent ideals, does the jagged &quot;better way&quot;&nbsp;seep&nbsp;away from the fingertips in the lust for all things easier and adventurous. Blacks and whites become the bars of a coded existence into a scanning of the universal expected for a predetermined price. Checking out from the shopping list of the&nbsp;prerequisite notions for success. Twisted by a label into an unreadable code and path outwards from the base uniformity of the identical and&nbsp;identifiable. Sometimes elusive differences gain footholds and crack open a fissure to become a wider break in the chapter which started on the island, and found it's way to the arctic. And that guy you thought was in a coma turned out to be your long lost brother and sweeping the streets with a toothbrush. Plot twists can be so cheesy sometimes.<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""82""/>"

Is the creep in the room really not the speed at which life changes?

Calling into that change, as a siren into the doorway. The new form of all being from this speck of a moment to all those pearls on the chain extending outwards. Nodal existence in the mirror like image of choices in the ever here and now and been and from on. Falling backward in time as the past cannot help but seem like the easy mirror to rear view look the future over again. Breaking through the dogmatic notions of the image being pointed not future ways. Been done here the more over times than not. Rooting over the chain and slipping on all the daily. I falter in the thrust of the everyday keep the wheels on this crazy bus tract. Stick shifting my way in a new transmissions form of learning, living, and looking, forward. If because it finds suit in a position of union or shores off and prairie. Could the schedule of the father trip a repeat into the choice of holy and sometimes not there. Tears fabrics across tapestritic majestic. Choices don&rsquo;t skip, they run on threads which can dump the unyielding one, in a pile of it all. Weave well. What junks the change so I can&rsquo;t even do the damn dishes? Eat much, clean little. Ouch! Proverbial piles not withstanding...

Theories... Of some kinds to find a class... a career... a doorway... a home... a rental... a borrowed. Being able to look to horizons that distinctly track beyond a single handful of years. The 5-year plan becomes a question of graduation into the ever more outwards. Can the spiral suit? I certainly hope so."

Slipping inward and pushing outward from the center of a hope. Spiraling across fate's divides into the things which cannot be understood or expected from any point prior to the unfolding. In the sync of all things known and deciphered in the crossing of the bridges in the twine, the clarity comes in time. Weaving the tapestry with&nbsp;nary&nbsp;a notion of the threads being used and the image being resolved. Fathoming the reality whilst in the throws, amounts to calling the game before it's played. Foolish in the sun of another day basking in the unknown. I crack my hand against the wall, cursing the things that are the way they are. But in the turn the world seems hardly stationary. Shaking my head through the song, elated by what we had going on. How to find it here, and the steps which takes it to the next there. Things that sneak up on the id, and the cloaks they wear in the darkness. Miles burned in the sand, and the palm of the hand reeling in the shaking of so many others. Trees and palms meet in such awkward ways. Careful not to tumble off branches which seem supportive in the rush of climbing that tree. Acorns found at great highs carry a softness, but hide a danger in the pursuit. Fallen from a good many trees or branches in my day.<br /><br />Life in the golden sun is a good trip, just don't burn under the lights!<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""80""/><lj-embed id=""81""/>"

Alternate universes are no place for the locked up mindsets. Green within the eyes by sights beyond daily rational&nbsp;omitting.

In a moment of life something other, does the noose become a tie, with hand upon the lever controlling our own planks.

Speaking of all things intertwined, the knots become ever tightening into the morass of self induced&nbsp;nausea. &nbsp;Letting the world ride upon the blindness can only lead to broken wheels turning in ruts.

Crazed beyond words into the spike of a notion never. Like a cradle falling from a tree and becoming lost in the grey. Beauty is found in all forms and at all times from the most unexpected of turns. Creatures form conclusions in the recesses of the mind, with sparing information and fleeting freedoms. Letting go of planks or notions becomes the function of the lever pulled by one's own hand.

Things come and go, things build and recede. All forms of dolls, puppets and cheer, lace the morality wide open with goodness being the prime mover. Decorated niceties only mask the mere niceness of all things holly. True spirit and purpose lies within strange pastures in ever unexpected ways. Do we count them up in a piggy bank awaiting the next deluge in a year's time? Or find a will to become the everyday hope of all things authentic in each and every? Crossed steps and fingers bring with them leadings into twists. Do turns make for further degrees in the ever spiral out? Wandering can lead to the nethers that were never envisioned but somehow needed. As a jog to the nog that forms crusts around our choices, somehow beveling out a notion of fate within that void only seen in the hindsight rear view. Fine tuning with leaps and bounds will always miss what falls outside the footprints themselves. Chilling timing in the face of morasses sneaking up upon the surrendered. Disguise in the reeds a new beginning with half a hope of prosper, in the blind of this duck hunt gone pee knuckle. Thoughts running into mazes of constantly re-aligning walls, begging the void to call out a bearing. Fog will certainly bring solace, even if it lies upon the jagged.

Having the legs to travel and the means to do so, is something that is hard to be patient for. Getting my British citizenship and traveling and/or working in Europe is a most exciting proposition.

Moving halfway across the country seemed at first to be an unnerving notion... Sometimes you must truly leap with both feet to land on the pedestal that you belong on.

"event","With a watchful eye on the weather, the climate begins to shift. Out into a neglect of the healthier notions in life, further spiraled into all forms of nail holes. Battling across an undivided and indeterminate no man's land of all things between hairless apes. High roads finding paths which stoop to no end of depths, rabbit holes get kind of ugly towards the bottom. Do we take direction from other vessels on a different course, and hope to avoid the same icebergs? How is crossing through any of this going to change the horizon and it's ever openness to a click forward on the clock of life. The world around us beckons a call in all directions, finding horizons across all angles and edges. Quite a mucky little nexus indeed. The vision of an equity within the ether, is never finding peace, in a world full of such random beauty. Everything displays it's truth into the void, in one way or another, and the world is all around to soak it up. The chance collisions of people who would become aware to the lines that form their worlds, laying the tracks for movement into mutuality. Finding the rim, only begets the glass becoming less full as you delve deeper. Evolution within the swirling mass of cosmic whateverisms, only begins to describe how each moment is a collection of seemingly infinite, but minute and trivial details coalescing into chanceness. 

Would anyone even be able to tell you...? Life does have it's many ways into that spiral. Working into the vectors of what I would discern as mute, only to find the most precious things. Locked away in the complexity and the beauty of how it simply works to end up being. Defining the world as a form of the function to achieve those efforts which could not be solely undertaken or even failed. The darkness is always alive in the edge of the periphery, lurking with wolves eyes into that void which I&nbsp;spiral forth and outwards within. Coming of all things, like blind siding a world on it's boundary already, The findings are hardly ever found, or even conclusive when found. Faced with questions storming up all over the horizon. Caught in the eye of a hurricane of change, reaching into that cyclone and finding direction from strange angles, and markers out of odd shaped boxes. Dreams withstanding as any would in a scenario born within a hurricane.

The rain can do a great many things. Purge of all sorts. Looking forward to my first good ride in the summer rain. Hope I don't have my first wipeout too...."

As the time floats by I can't help but realize that being a creature of adventure, means that I will rarely if ever be happy in the same spot for long. Dynamic change and variety are prerequistes for a life that must evolve at a worthy pace. Finding new feelings and new outlets is always a course to become within unfamiliar waters. Reefs and tidal waves become occupational hazards for the ever adventurous one. Shipwrecking isn't a problem if you know how to spot land, swim and survive in unhabitual circumstances. Habit can be the knife with which a thousand cuts finds death slowly. Do we change our current or find other rivers? Daunting at best mind you, always.</p><p>What went wrong...? What let anything down? Is it in the nature of things to become and receed into the waves upon our seashore of life. Contained within the notions of something that cannot be wrong... And finding that the elusive right turn finds another gravity. Controlling the thoughts amount to subversion. Denying the seek allows for little debate over the direction. Days end into night and find another round become deader soldiers, like dominos falling between the cracks and resurfacing the edges of a long forgotten shape. Can the peg fit the hole? Would the world allow for such cohesion? Beyond the beckoning of things in the mist, and the birds which we find in hand. Does flying become the extroverted prose? Getting to know the feeling... Feeling being a measure of some place. In the head the space becomes tight, restrained, convoluted and least of all paralyzed. What is will be...

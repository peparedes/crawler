(cha ching cha ching, Carly -$45)  I hate MAC.  They sell makeup which I hate but somehow they get me to buy it and then I get home and put it on a shelf to find a month later and be like 'I bought this shit?' I wonder if I'm going to miss high school.  I wish I spent more time piling up substantial memories to tell my kids.  I've only got like 3 really good stories and my kids are going to have to wait till they're at least 16 to hear them.  I can't find my Ouji board because my sister hid it and she won't tell me where because she's convinced its demonic.  I've been looking all morning.  Man I wake up early now I don't have school.

Man I haven't gone to school yet this week and I can't get that song out of my head.  Yesterday I felt like a...something that feels bad.  So I just kind of went from my bed to the couch to the fridge and then I watched a really sad movie and was crying and then the phone rang and I answered it thinking how could someone on the phone possibly tell if I was crying or not and that there was no way it could be for me because I thought it was earlier than 3:30.  Well ya, so now my friends all know I'm lame and cry during sad movies.  Oh well, it was good, 'Life As A House'.  I have to feel better and go to school and do my homework tomorrow so I don't fail or get my credits taken away.  All I want to do is sleep and read though.  I hate school."

So the weight of a couple tough decisions and at least the next year of my life rests on the outcome of one hour tomorrow.  Yes, 8:45 to approximately one hour from then.  Do I honestly truly care if I get in or not? Nope.  The only thing I can think about right now, as I am wasting time not writing 250 words about myself to bring to my interview tomorrow, is how much I want to live in an apartment to myself in BC with a matress on the floor for a bed, a window without a curtain to look through and with a pile of rockin' books, my skate, sailboard, a car, a pager, no phone, a turn table, my guitar, an old fashioned bath tub with feet, and a job working with challenged kids for the rest of my life.  We're reading Fifth Business in English and it is filling my head with this ambition to become a fool saint and not go to school to get a degree.
Its the long weekend this weekend.  Whatever though, I think it'll be bad.  I don't really have any good plans 'till Monday.

Tommorw apparently all thbat's gonna chanfw....and a big yi-haw for noy being able to type and frankly not caring.  As i was saying tomorow is gonna be plus 18 an plenty sunny.  I'm not using the backspace button no matter what, not cause I'm lazy, its the principle.  Who says the letters I accidentally hit are any less important that the ones I mean to?  Its like aborting a kid to backspace a letter.  Well not really but for a second there I felt pretty passionate about all that.  Last weekend I also got a wack jean jacket just like the one I saw in VICE when they did their 'find cool shit in the lost and found and lie and keep it when its not yours' article.  Its wack.  Plus a cool cardy.  (Cardy means cardigen if you're in the know).  Hmm what else did I do?  How about a big n-o-thing besides hang out with Steve and get wet.  Haha, just kidding, it was raining alot out so thats why we got wet.  NO I AM NOT GOING OUT WITH HIM, FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD!  If anyone else asks me or thinks that, I'm going to flip.  Ho-ly.    This weekend coming up is the long one.  And I should have fun but I kinda don't feel like it.  Which is wierd. I have my OCAD interview Friday and I'm hella worried.  
Grandaddy are so good.  My mom and I are on fragile terms right now.  After a week of clomping around my house in my prom shoes I think I have mastered walking in them.  I tried to roll around on my skate with them but pictured my leg breaking in half and quit that pretty fast.

"event","Ok so yesterday and the day before that I was pretty pissed, felt like crap and wasn't embracing life all that much.  I said some pretty mean things that I feel bad about.  I ignored my neighbour's friendly wave and stomped down my street not using the sidewalk or moving over for cars.  I slammed the front door just 'cause and scared my brother.  I yelled at Meichen in front of the whole art class, I swore loudly in front of a mom at work last night and I lied and said I wasn't home when I answered the phone last night because I didn't want to talk to that person.  So I feel like the town jerk right now.  My plan to redeem my happy-go-lucky composure however is this: a motto.  All esteemed clubs and establishments and organizations have snappy little mottos, and my lack of a motto probably was a key reason for the lapse in my ambience.  If I had a shiny snappy inspirational motto then I'd think before slamming a door just 'cause.  When you have a motto all your actions need to be just and deserving.  I'll have to wait for a good reason to be pissed.  I hope one day I'll get to smash a dinner plate.  It just seems so european and classy and dramatic.  I'd just be like: ""Hanz, I can take it no longer!"" and then *smash*."

  Lately I've been sucumbing to media pressure and the mainstream: I like the white stripes now, I bought a pair of hoochie capris from Guess that cost as much as the monthly lease rate on some cars, and I watched fashion file which I blame for the fat nightmare I got last night.  Its horrible.
  I listened to Husker Dur, Kitchens and Bathrooms, Pedro the Lion, GnR, the White Stripes, Crooked Fingers and the Beatles all morning.  I only downloaded songs from albums I already own, then it doesn't get on my conscience that bad and I don't feel like a music whore. 
  I'm kinda glad I'm sick today because I didn't do my homework this weekend.
  My mom rocks my world.  I wonder if I'll turn out like her when I get older, well actually that would suck, but I just hope I'm still that rad when I'm 42.

independence.  I'm going to go shopping alone today and its going to be smashing.  
listening to rad bands.  Fu Manchu, the Pixies, Ben Folds, Archers of Loaf, Organized Rhyme, and old Sloan.  A wierd mix but its all I want to listen to lately and its sssoooo great.
painting.  watch your back Pollock and Kandinsky!
indoor football......? deeeee-fence!
Stuff I hate with the passion of a thousand fires right now:
telephones.  And the people who call me on them.
turning up the volume on tv's too loud.
playing shows in front of people I know.
crooked socks
procrastination and getting side-tracked.  And frustration.
certain people who don't apologize.
journal entries that are too long....

Song of the day: Annie Waits, Ben Folds."

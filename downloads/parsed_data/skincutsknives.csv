today
about 6 years old,
he sat beside me
and as the train 
ran down along the coast
we came to the ocean
and then he looked at me
and said,
it's not pretty.

"event","""...I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.
From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out.
I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.""

"event","Saying what's already been said... what's already been felt and known for centuries...
That what is grown is meant to be. The earth the sun the rain the sea
The cycle of eternity...
The plants wich grow the deepest green,
No more be felt or seen? I see. I smoke. I rise......
and in my eyes, Mary Jane is always free...
By those who fly and laugh at society... Who grow and dance and sing...
So bring your herb, bring your freedom,
bring the lights within your eyes 
and fly! Fly past their chains... their lies... their joyless flames.
Our name is freedom.
Our name is Truth."

She's in your bones
She is your marrow
And your ride home
You can't avoid her
She's in the air (in the air)
In between molecules 
Of oxygen and carbon dioxide 
Only in dreams we see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold on to hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams 
You walk up to her
Ask her to dance
She says, 'Hey baby I just might take the chance'
You say, 'It's a good thing that you float in the air (in the air)
That way there's no way I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces.

Love is feeling, feeling love,
Love is wanting to be loved.
Love is touch, touch is love,
Love is reaching, reaching love,
Love is asking to be loved.
Love is you,
You and me,
Love is knowing,
We can be.
Love is free, free is love,
Love is living, living love,
Love is needing to be loved.

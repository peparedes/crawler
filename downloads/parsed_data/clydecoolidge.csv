"event","Steve seemed to think that my above quote should be heard, so uh, there ya' go. It's really the opposite of my mood, the title should have read:
""I Love You March!!!!""

Hmm, why you ask, well Oblivion, Sopranos, and the Sex Pistols, that's why. 

The Elder Srolls IV: Oblivion is an rpg for the Xbox 360 that I have been anticipating for quite some time. I played the last one on xbox and it sucked me in. There's upwards of a hundred hours of gameplay in this bad boy. Comes out March 20th. There's sort of a ""medieval"" feel to it. 

The Sopranos season 6 starts March 12th. Wow, that was one long wait. With New York in shambles (nothing funnier than seeing Johnny Sac running from the feds and falling in the snow at his own house), we could see a shit storm rain down on Jersey. The feds case against the Soprano family hit a wall with the ""offing"" of Adriana by Sil. And who knows what's up with that loose cannon Artie Bucco. Man I love this show. See you on Sundays Steve!!!

And I just heard this morning that the Sex Pistols are being inducted into the Rock n' Roll hall of fame. 'bout freakin' time. And in true Sex Pistols fashion, they, at this point, refuse to attend the ceremony. I understand for two reasons 1. They're the freakin' Sex Pistols and 2. Apparently inductees (at least in this case) are only comped a ticket for themselves and sometimes a guest. Screw that, didn't they get the memo, this is the day of the entourage. Recognize!!!

Well that's all for now. Lots to keep my busy in March.

Anyways, haven't updated in awhile so here goes:

eDy on permanent hiatis due to drummer leaving for Springfield. Band will try and hold together until' we find out if he's ever coming back. Otherwise I guess we'll need a new drummer. Damn this is a hard band to keep together. 

Studio recording project is back in full swing. Man that's fun over there, just wish I didn't have to travel to Mukwanago to do it. I don't even like spelling that. 

Music documentary (mostly bands from Sussex) will be started on next week. There is an unbelievable amount of footage to go through and organization to start on. Think about having tons of video from bands that dated back 14 years involving many, many people!!! It will be a blast to do all the interviews and stuff though. Seeing people jam when they were 16 and interviewed when they're in their 30's should be quite amusing. Rock on Chicago!!! (you get it if you know). RIP. 

I just got an ipod nano and that thing rules. I don't need a super storage device for my music, I have everything on my computer. I just wanted to be able to ditch the carrying of cd's idea. The fm transmitter works flawlessly in my car. Exceeded my expectations for sure. 

Well I continue my quest for an Xbox 360 tonight. Best Buy said that they get numerous systems each week. I just have to get there at the right time. Game on!!!

And on another movie note: If anyone is interested in acting in some short films, drop a response. We will need people around summertime for numerous projects. Intimate knowledge of Steve Buscemi movies a must!! Kidding.

Anyone who really knows me, knows that I would never intentionally cause problems or anything. 
Other than that, school starts up tomorrow already. Damn that was quick.

"event","Well, well, another year gone by. They sure do go by fast these days. I had a nice Christmas with mine and Jenny's family. Fun was had by all. I'm going to get an ipod nano with the gift cards I've been saving since my birthday. I ripped pretty much all the music I have to my hard drive on my pc. With the nano I should be able to avoid cd's for just about everthing. I'm going with a flash memory player cuz' of the no skipping factor. Hard drive players can skip if you're working out hardcore or something. And you know I'll be doing that. uh, yeah. Seriously though, that'll be a good new year's thingy if I can actually stick with an excercise program. 

I saw my friend Dale, who moved to L.A. 5 or 6 years ago. It was fun. His band is looking to sign real soon. Yippie. He said ""fuck it"" and sold his house here and moved out there to play music. Much respect. BALZERKER!!! Check out their band here www.myspace.com/shapesofracecars
I also saw my friend Mike T., who I haven't really gotten together with for many years. That will now change. I miss him. 

Well, after the new year here eDy will be put in drive and playing shows and doing other stuff that we do. I can't wait to play out again, it's been too long. I always have these long stints of not playing and it feels like I'm in a band that does nothing but stay in the basement (or shop in this case). That will change real soon. It's usually circumstances that can't be helped, and I'm glad that we always push past the bs and keep going. I likey the music. 

I declare: Everyone have a happy (and safe) New Year!!!! I'll be drunk.

"event","Well something happened to me yesterday that I don't remember ever happening to me. I went Christmas shopping with the woman and I headed right for the electronics dept. (as always) There was really only one reason for this, xbox 360. So I begin playing Kameo on the kiosk (demo unit) they have set up. Pretty freakin' cool, and this furthers my desire for the system. I only play for about 5 minutes as I am there to buy presents for loved ones and not to play video games. Well about 10 minutes later, I decide to go look at the accessories and whatnot for the 360. Faceplates, hard drives, wireless controllers, headsets, wireless adapters, memory cards, games, all in their very attractive ""next gen"" packaging. Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, this very heavy feeling of excitement and anxiety kick in. I probably felt something like this when I was 5 years old and waiting for some sort of Star Wars toy, but now?, when I'm 31 years old? How can this be? I actually had to make myself walk away from these ""toys"" to stop the feeling, or I would have passed out or something. I mean I have loved video games since Atari and am always excited when new stuff comes out, but never like this, and never such a sudden, ""heavy"" feeling. Man I want an Xbox 360. Do I need help or what?"

My Cisco networking class blows. Got a D on my final cuz' I mixed up some hardware functions. Dammit, I even took off a day of work to study and had it all down. That one little mix up set of the chain of wrong answers that got me the D. Sucks. I think I'll still get a C in the class though. The vendor portion is really tough so the school offsets that with some easier stuff, labs, a journal, and a written mid and final that counts for 55%. So I should be good. Last class tonight and all I have is a one night a week operating systems class. Ah, time to relax. 

I got a subscription to netflix now. I'm not burning all the dvd's I rent.:)
Anyways, I watched a movie I haven't seen for years called Suburbia. It's about a group of homeless punkers, freakin' awesome movie, though some of the acting leaves something to be desired. 80's Independant film, whatya' gonna do. Flea from the chili peppers has a prominant role. He's about 16 or 17 years old in this movie. The credits list him as ""Mike B. the Flea."" Funny. I'm also convinced that this movie was the first time the phrase ""Guess what...chicken butt, was every muttered. 
 
I didn't win the lottery so I'm at work now, yippie!

The band is going slow once again and we may not be practicing tomorrow. That's already two out of three weeks missed. That sucks, but we do get some stuff done when the rest of us get together. Oh well.

Acutally it wasn't in safe mode, it just retained all the settings of safe mode. I freakin' tried everthing except reloading windows in that monster. It's from 1998 so I'll lay it to rest now.

You control two squads and it is by far the most intense and immersive video game I have ever played. And that's sayin' alot cuz' I've been gaming since I was a small boy. I feel like I just ran a couple miles after playing that. I find myself pausing the game quite freqently and saying out loud that this is the best video game I've ever played. Wow, that sounded lame. 
Enough lameness, Bye."

On Friday I have to meat with a Finacial Aid commitee to see if they will reinstate my aid. If not, I owe $900 cuz' I'm already half way through 3 classes this semester. I think they'll give it to me though, I'm gettin' good grades so they better. 
Other than that, I am very excited about the show coming up since we haven't played out since I can't remember when. Some new material will be debuted and I will drink one beer or more. I'll guess more. 
Another attempt to quit smoking will comense on Saturday. Hey I gotta atleast try. Chest pains are becoming more frequent.

   I haven't smoked in almost 2 weeks!!! Well I did have a couple of cigs on Saturday night at the bar, but to me this was quite an accomplishment. I would normally start smoking again the next day after cheating, but this time I had no disire to. I'm still chewing the nicotine gum, and will continue to do so until' I'm fixed. What a horrible habit I've developed. 
   Speaking of habits, my beer consuption has hit an all time low. (Except for when I didn't drink, when I was like 5) Miller brewery has called, and was worried about me.

There's so many kick ass games coming out around the holidays I can't wait. I know I sound lame, but these games keep me at home more, which in turn keeps me from spending my money at the bar, which is a waste. So go vids!!!!
Recording is coming along, although a bit slower cuz' of some family problems I'm dealing with at the moment. Which is another thing that inadvertantly discourages me from drinking. It sucks that a bad thing for someone else turns into a good thing for me. I just don't want to end up like my dad. I'm Brad not my dad. Hey, what a mantra. 
Enough with the depressing stuff. 
Can't wait to finish recording and finally get some shows at other places than the BBC. I like the place and everthing, just kind of sick of playing there. Need new atmospheres!!! 
I'm registered for two classes this semester. I will acomplish this goal of mine someday. I'm quite a bit more focused these days so I should finish some more classes this semester.

"event","ok this happened on wednesday but i have been so busy i havent had time to post.  So I'm engaged.  Here's how it happened.  On wednesday my man was planning on coming to work for lunch.  It was the last full day of work and he works from home on wednesdays.  So when he arrived he looked excited and gave me a new cell phone.  My old cell phone was   terrible and i had been complaining about it for a year and saying that eventually ill get a new one but i never did.  So we went up to the common office and i showed off my new phone.  Then he told me to look at the accesories and there was a ring box.  So i accepted and and cried and then there was this big lunch with the whole faculty and they made an announcement and everyone was fauning over me and the ring and i was just glowing.  It was wonderful.  It was especially wonderful because its so unlike him.  He is not a big fan of public displays of affection or big crowds or anything like that so all of that attention must have been very uncomfortable for him but he knew that i was expecting it after the school year and that i would be disapointed to not be able to show everyone.  So yeah I have been soo incredibly happy.  And the ring is just soo beutiful.  Everything is wonderful."

"event","I love my man soo much.  Last night we went to bed pretty late.  Usually when this happens we just go right to sleep but justin was all sweet and lovey.  So we kissed alot (he is a super kisser) and we ended up having sex.  It was the sweetest most loving sex we have had in a year.  It was just wonderful.  After i came I just started to cry over how wonderful he is and how much I love him.  He is going to propose to me really soon.  Its going to happen any day now I jsut can't wait.  I want to marry him so much he realy is the perfect man."

"event","so friday i was really miserable and couldning work so i stayed home last minute which is going to make the next week pretty miserable for me.  My students didnt have a sub and this is the time of the year when everyday is planned and if you miss something you are kinda screwed.  I haver figured out a way to fix it, it just wont be easy.  

so after feeling that miserable i got a little better and decided to go to atlantic city with some friends as planned.  I'm really glad i went because i had a great time.  These were friends of mine from college that i dont normally get to see.  It was pretty relaxed a little gambling (none of us are big gamblers)a little drinknig but mainly just hanging out and catching up.  The last night me and my man left the group to go to this club weve been to before.  Its a club where you can go and have public sex.  We really like going.  So we told our friends where we were going and left.  I was really excited to go and pretty horny as i was feeling much better.  So we get there and head to the hot tub were we usually get started.  I was feeling horney and really loved and lovey and i was expressing that.  Then this couple enters the tub.  The girl is really really agressive.  and palying with another couple and ignoring her guy.  So i gave him a little show which i know my man really enjoyed.  It was pretty timid and i was cool with that (as i said i was feeling very loved and safe).  Anyway so then alittle later that agressive girl came over and started playing with me.  I was really not prepared for this.  My man was watching and really enjoying the show.  I was very tense and kind of enjoying it but also just realy nervous.  It ddint last that long or go that far.  Anyway after i was feeling like i jsut needed to be held and reasured.  My man was super turned on by it so i was holdiing him and helping him out alittle.  Anyway he was picking up on my needs and i sorta denied it because i didnt want to ruin the rest of his fun.  So then we had some good fun in the tub jsut the two of us.  After that we went downstairs and just kinda held eachother.  I was feeling done and wanted to go home he wasnt feeling done.  He picked up on my mood and started to head out.  He likes to watch.  Which isnt realyl a problem but i just wanted to feel held and everything and he wanted to watch a bit before he left.  I didnt like this and he could tell so we left.  He was just alittle annoyed because he feels like he never gets to watch and stuff, and i was jsut being sensative.  He wasnt being critical or anythign i just knew me needing to leave didtn make him happy and i wanted to make him happy.  So we didnt really talk about ti because i ddint want to then we went back to the group hung out and went to sleep.  Now he was realyl thrilled abotu the whole thing it was a anfatsay of his.  Im not upset it happened or anyhting but im just not nearly as thrilled about it as him.  I really just need more time to process my feelings about it.  Which he is cool about.  He didnt push any of this on me or even initiate it.  In fact he tries to be really careful with my feelings and is super sweet.  I just need to think about it."

"event","so yesterday i felt horribly congested and i was sure it was just allergies (my lymph nodes weren't swollen) but i was still quite miserable.  The medicine i was taking hardly did anything.  This morning I woke up feel worse.  ( night tossing and turning becuase you can't breathe will do that to you.)  So if igured i really had to go to work (when you are a teacher missing work is a bitch especially if you have to cover certain things before finals)  So i shower get dressed and make myself some toast.  I didnt eat dinner the night before because my tummy was bothering me so i figured toast would help me feel better.  Well I was wrong.  After only a few minutes I threw up and was feeling worse than ever.  So i decided to call in sick.  I'm sure I dont have a substitute because i called it in so late so i feel bad.  It sucks being sick when you are teacher.  There are too many people depending on you to be there and if you dont know in advance you cant make sub plans or get a sub for that matter. And really how often do you plan being sick."

"event","so i went back and got my hair fixed.  It was the second time in my life i ever sent something back to be fixed.  I never send anything back to be fixed not food not damaged merchandise nothing.  I once sent back chicken because it was raw inside and would have made me sick but that was the only time.  Well now my hair looks right.  It's the color i asked for in the first place.  YAY!"

"event","so i decided to treat myself to a nice hair cut and even do some fun highlights for the summer. I had them a year ago and liked them.  I have dark brown hair and like a touch of red in it.  I was extremely clear to the hair dresser that i wanted red highlights, and she kept saying honney back to me so i kept saying red.  She eventually said i get it you want red.  Well guess what they are basically blond highlights.  Its not that they look that horrible but its not at all what i wanted.  I wanted red.  I dont know how much clearer i could have been and now im really not happy with my hair.  Something that was supposed to be a nice thing now really sucks.  I ram really attached to my hair.   Its pretty long and takes a while to grow things like this out.  I really wanted something simple.  Something that i knew could easily be done because i have never had a problem with it before but now my hair is ruined.  It really seems vain which i really dont consider myself but its putting me in tears.  I just want my hair back now no highlights jsut the regular brown that it is.  But died hair never gets back to normal until it grows out.  Which wont be for litterally 2 years.  So yeah i dont really know what to do.  I might go back and say fix it for free.  (it was a $150 cut so it should come out right)  I never send food back.  I have never gone back to get hair fixed nothing like that its just not me.  Also if she screwed up the first time why can i trust her not to make it worse.  I mean it really doesnt look bad now.  Its just not at all what i wanted.  This really shouldnt make me this upset but it really has."

"event","Well lets see I haven't updated this thing in over a year.  I don't know if anyone is going to read this but if you do please reply just so i know people are reading.  Well heres what's beeing going on for the last year.  Overall its been a wonderful year.   I'm in my second year teaching and first year is hell so the second year feels pretty good.  You actually feel like you have a clue what you are doing and are somewhat confident.  Its pretty good.  I can't beleve the year is almost over it flew by so quickly.  I'm still living with the same man.  He is pretty wonderful and our relationship has been pretty good this year.  Of course there are some problems like work kills my sex life so we pretty much only have sex on the weekends but that has been getting steadily better as work gets less stressful.  Also it disapears and our love life returns when I'm on vacation.  So I know its not an us thing as much as a being tired thing.  Neither of us are great about chores so that can sometimes be annoying but i think thats just life.  He also spends tons of time playing computer games and riding his bike and stuff, but he has always been this way.  Kind of independant and a bit of a computer geek.  Its usually not a problem.  Most importantly I'm pretty sure he is ready to propose to me.  This is a huge deal since we have been dating almost 7 years now and i was starting to get worried that it would never happen.  I have even had nightmares about it and everything.  My impatience has made me discuss ti with hima  bunch of times which is how i know he is ready now.  Which is cool i just can't wait for it to happen.  Anyway so life is really good now which is just a great thing to be able to put down in this journal.  please respond just so i know someone is reading this even if you dont have much to say."

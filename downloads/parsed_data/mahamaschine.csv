"event","Yeah, well i guess this is my first lj entry besides the uh..example entry ; )  I had my first incar today, which kinda kinda blew because it was all country roads...for 2 hours, and the lady that was instructing me was really dry in like, conversations. So that kinda sucked. It all turned out good though cuz i got al 3's which is the best. so i gotta brag about that, even though i almost ran into a big truck who had the rightaway... The only amusement i had driving that freakin long was smashing into flys, to see how many i could get. I unno, i think i got liek 10 er somethin, and the window was all nasty with guts...but im guessin you dont really wanna hear bout that. Eh heh!

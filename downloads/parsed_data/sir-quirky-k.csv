Because Six Apart is not a fit landlord, but an evil corporation who are part of Bush's far-right Christian agenda (apologies to all the relatively liberal Christians on my friendlist) as illustrated by their decision that images of breastfeeding are somehow evil (but only as default pictures?!?) and (this is what made my decision for me - thanks, I guess, to <lj user=""solarbird""> for this one) they're <a href=""http://noljads.com/images/screencaps/new_profile_with_ads.png"">making the user profile page ugly for the sole benefit of advertisers</a>.

<lj user=""daweaver""> has kept track of all this far better than me, and I highly recommend <a href=""http://www.daweaver.free-online.co.uk"">his primary blog</a> for his Six Apart Is Useless posts (and much else besides, come to that).

You can now find me on <a href=""http://www.greatestjournal.com"">GreatestJournal</a> with the same username. You can also still find me on IM, indeed this is how I contact most of you now.

Particular apologies to my last new LJ friend, <lj user=""redhead81187"">. I'm sorry for not providing you with anything of interest."

Mum is dragging her heels over finance-related forms and I'm convinced it's deliberate - to make sure I don't go, hoping I won't notice until it's too late.

I was given an L by <lj user=""helmwige"">...

<lj-cut text=""And here's my ten."">

1. Laughter. Despite my definite cynical streak, I'm more than happy to laugh at things I find amusing. These might not be what many people find amusing, though. I've been known to dig out one of my old racing games and pick particularly fast, slow or just plain weird vehicles to drive in an irrational manner for amusement value, and particularly bad commentary on sports video games can also amuse me.

2. Leicester. The name haunts me a little to this day. I had my heart set on this university, six hours by train from my home, before eventually being dissuaded from it by my controlling mother. My fear of leaving at all then grew to the point where I rejected university entirely for a year, but now I am heading to Southampton - 90 minutes by train, and the closest university of any prestige to home - this September to read Economics.

3. Lyrics. I can't believe I didn't think of this one first. Lyric writing is my most effective form of creative release; I've dabbled with setting them to music, though a lack of theoretical knowledge has invariably acted against this (some seem to think otherwise, remarkably). My songwriting remains a secret to much of my family and I'm afraid to pursue it here as a result; I won't be so scared at university.

4. Laptop. Many happy hours - and some unhappy ones - have been spent on my laptop, communicating with people I would never have known otherwise among other things. But those hours have been running out ever since the optical drive stopped working, and a new desktop is likely to be heading to Southampton with me.

5. Luck. Entirely predictable events are exceedingly dull, and it is luck that adds unpredictability to make life far more interesting. This additionally applies to game shows, which is one reason why I love <i>Deal or No Deal</i> - anything can, and invariably does, happen.

6. Lilac. One of my favourite colours, not least because it complements grey/silver very well; for that reason, it is the colour of the walls in my room, and of one of my two duvet covers.

7. Loneliness. In many ways, I'm quite an extreme introvert. Some might not notice as much from my LJ, or indeed from real life, but I really don't crave social interaction much - especially in the form of mass social gatherings that invariably degenerate into alcohol, loud music or inane conversation (or all three). I can count the number of evenings out of any form that I've had in the last few years on my fingers, I suspect.

8. Livejournal. I suppose I had to say this eventually. Though in my case it has been 20% blogging, 80% networking opportunity. Being able to find someone who shares a common interest within a few clicks has allowed me to discover so many interesting individuals, most of whom will be reading this.

9. Lighting. I believe it has an enormous effect on atmosphere that many people underestimate, and is a very effective way of stamping individuality on any house. And one day, I'll have my own house, and I'm sure it will feature unusual lighting.

10. Labels. In many different forms. All my life, I have and will be stuck with a psychological label; I consider it merely a catch-all term for explaining some of the more dramatic differences between myself and the majority of people. I quite consciously shun all designer labels, as I don't believe in being a walking advert. And I dislike the simplistic 'labelling' of anything, though I know <lj user=""lauradalloway""> disagrees with my preference not to 'label' singing voices."

"event","Take a look at your LJ friends list, then list up to ten things you want to say to ten different LJ friends.
DO NOT state who these people are.
DO NOT confirm nor deny any ""comment speculation"".

I may, intentionally or more likely otherwise, have been ambiguous in these statements, and some may apply to more than one.

1. I am embarrassed that what I consider extremely biased and self-centred suggestions are actually exceedingly sensible and have caused you to rethink such an important part of your life.
2. Your remarkable courage in breaking free from a situation that constrained you dramatically is something I envy and wish I could duplicate.
3. You have helped me believe I can write for my own voice in spite of its limitations.
4. In many ways you could not be less like me, and yet I still admire you.
5. I always believed this world was scary but I had to learn about it; you have certainly confirmed that and helped me learn more.
6. You have been almost ruined by the ignorance and mistakes of authority figures. I am immensely relieved you are coming out the other side; if only it wasn't such a long road back.
7. Your fear and self-loathing is affecting a wonderful character; I only hope the media images that further intensify in the summer do not make things worse.
8. It is to my great shame - and due to my great lack of courage - that I have never seen you in real life.
9. You have been a constant source of support to me. I wish I shared the optimistic side of your personality as well as the pessimistic side.
10. I have never met you, yet I gave you a Dairy Milk."

I am fairly certain that <lj user=""milliedillmount""> has this specific CD... she's certainly mentioned singing <i>Where the Bee sucks there lurk I</i> and listening to Kirkby's version, which is the last track on this CD...

Incidentally, where did I find this hidden gem? In a local charity shop in the worst part of this town, for 75p ($1.40). And no, I couldn't believe it either."

In other news, the moron on my user icon has been bumped to the backbenches. Thank goodness for that. Sadly, that won't stop his destructive plans from coming to fruition. Which is why I said I have ten years to leave this country for good, which is how long my passport will be if I renew it this month - as I now effectively have to."

"event","<i>1) If you could choose to live anywhere at all, where would it be and would you live with others or alone?</i>
It would unquestionably be alone. And it would probably be on high ground in a temperate climate where food production is possible, so that I am relatively well prepared for large-scale environmental disasters.

<i>2) What is your happiest childhood memory?</i>
Defining 'childhood' as extending as far as the age of not-quite-thirteen, it has to be being part of the winning school team in the county mathematics quiz. Heck, it was the only time I was ever remotely proud of that school!

<i>3) What is your favourite piece of music and why?</i>
Tough one as it's inevitably a little transient. Right now I have two. There's the theme music to <i>Miljoenenjacht</i> (the Dutch original version of <i>Deal or No Deal</i>, for those who aren't Dutch or game show fans) - infuriatingly catchy, dramatic and yet joyous at once - and, for darker and more reflective moments, <i>The Memory of Trees</i> by Enya is somehow soothing while still frequently making me cry. It being used on a charity advert really didn't help that...

<i>4) What's the most important thing you've learnt in life?</i>
Many, maybe most, individuals cannot be trusted, but that does not mean nobody can be trusted.

<i>5) What was the first album you ever bought?</i>
I think it's <i>Version 2.0</i> by Garbage (teenage angst alert!) if you discount the many dance music compilations I possess."

"event","Bad news: I was planning a concert that, among other things, would have included my music. However, that now isn't happening, as people didn't turn up to meetings about it.

Good news: The person organising it with me (a girl called Louise) happens to be a very good singer, and she suggested I come up with some other smaller project, and I did; a recital for her that included some of my music.

Result: I'm still going to be hearing someone performing some of the music I've written for a singer less limited than myself :)

I haven't heard Louise but I do know she's versatile; she's been quite the utility chorister in the past, singing every female part in different choirs (and I think she's filled in as an emergency tenor too). I *think* she's a mezzo, I remember her being worried about the D6 in one of my songs ages ago ('you won't get anyone in school to sing that' she said, implying she wasn't an exception - by <lj user=""artela"">'s definition, that means she's not a soprano), but I'll check exactly what she can and can't do some time this week and then I can start writing for her (or dig out some of my other songs and transpose them, probably downwards, as required)."

"event","My job is going nicely, but the same cannot be said for my relationship with Mum, who today deigned to make 'an executive decision' to buy two shirts, one of which was identical to one my brother purchased last week. Last week she paid for precisely one of the shirts that my brother <i>chose</i> to buy. She's doing the same here (well, paying for 50% of the cost of the two differently-priced shirts), but I didn't choose to buy these. She bought them because she said I needed them. I don't, and if I did I'd buy them from charity shops.

This hurt, not least because it coincided with the first anniversary of <a href=""http://sir-quirky-k.livejournal.com/2005/02/11/"">Moretongate</a> (new readers; click the link and all will be revealed).

Also, two days ago - immediately after I'd watched <a href=http://www.haloscan.com/comments/brigbother/deal09022006/>one of the greatest moments in UK game show history</a> (and she knew it... she saw it too) - she came upstairs, all cheerful, <i>to show me information she'd got about distance learning</i>, which she's probably desperate for me to do because it's cheaper and allows her to keep control of me (she implied there was no benefit of me living away from home and that 'you're not really interested in the whole uni experience'). Way to bump me down to earth after such an amazing moment, Mum."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Here"">1. What did you do in 2005 that you'd never done before?
Travel on a train on my own. However, it was <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sir_quirky_k/2005/02/11/"">for just fifteen minutes each way, and even then against Mum's wishes</a>.

2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?
<lj user=""lauradalloway""> correctly pointed out the apostrophe here is misplaced. I never did make any resolutions last year. This year... I'm not sure any resolutions are appropriate, except maybe 'Get out of Weymouth ASAP'.

3. Did anyone close to you give birth?
Nope.

4. Did anyone close to you die?
Two elder relatives, including one of my grandfathers.

5. What countries did you visit?
I didn't.

6. What would you like to have in 2006 that you lacked in 2005?
Personal freedom.

7. What date from 2005 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?
Hard to say. Maybe July 7 - or December 7, the day I was going to move to Manchester but didn't.

8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?
Surviving it.

9. What was your biggest failure?
Too many to mention.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?
Appendicitis in July.

11. What was the best thing you bought?
Such a capitalist question :( I honestly can't remember.

12. Whose behavior merited celebration?
<lj user=""shinydan""> and <lj user=""saintmaryuk""> and everyone else who encouraged me to get out of here.

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?
Mum. Enough said. Oh, and the teacher who <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sir_quirky_k/2005/01/22/"">tried to stop me performing my music for charity</a>.

14. Where did most of your money go?
To Mum. Enough said.

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?
The prospect of moving; the prospect of singing my music for charity; the prospect of a hung parliament at the 2005 election. Two of them didn't happen, the third might as well not have done.

16. What song will always remind you of 2005?
Hmmm. Of those released in 2005, <i>Fix You</i> by Coldplay. Removing that artificial limitation, <i>Way Away</i> by Yellowcard.

17. Compared to this time last year, are you:
i. Happier or Sadder?: Much, much sadder.
ii. Thinner or Fatter than last year?: I couldn't be much thinner, and yet I think I am...
iii. Richer or Poorer?: Richer, but only because I don't spend my money

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?
Actively rebelling against Mum. And indulging in creative pursuits.

19. What do you wish you'd done less of?
Job hunting, by virtue of it being unnecessary due to me being at university.

20. How will you be spending Christmas?
Already happened, obviously. And I mostly opened presents and played a few silly games.

22. Did you fall in love in 2005?
No.

23. How many one-night stands?
N/A

24. What was your favorite TV program?
Deal or No Deal. Hell, it's pretty much all I've watched this year, and it only started on Halloween.

25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?
Mum, but I'm not sure I didn't hate her this time last year.

26. What was the best book you read?
Probably some scatalogical collection of funny quotes, they blend into one.

27. What was your greatest musical discovery?
<lj user=""pianoscry"">, for reminding me that a glass-shattering range isn't necessary to write music. (Not that it doesn't help, as the scary sopranos on my friendlist - that would be about a third of them - will probably insist.)

28. What did you want and get?
The ability to use the Internet at the same time as my brother - unfortunately, this was achieved by means of a wireless 'connection', i.e. a way of ensuring hackers get more time on your connection than you do.

29. What did you want and not get?
Personal freedom.

30. What was your favorite film of this year?
Nanny McPhee. I watched it at a time when the move was very much on the cards, and there were several moments where I cried and cried because I was reminded of my own emotions surrounding the move.

31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?
Opened presents and played with them. And I was 19.

32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?
Moving out.

33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2005?
Hard to say. Most of what I bought came from charity shops, so maybe there's an ethical perspective...

34. What kept you sane?
I was sane this year?

35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?
I didn't. Never have.

36. What political issue stirred you the most?
Take your pick. Probably global warming, not least because one of the hurricane season.

37. Who did you miss?
Some of my creative school friends.

38. Who was the best new person you met?
Online, it's hard to say but I'll go with <lj user=""lauradalloway"">; offline... <i>did</i> I meet anyone new? I'm not too sure I can name anyone.

39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2005?
I am an adult, and those who try to treat me like a child are usually acting unethically.

40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:
I'll have to think of one later...</lj-cut>"

Three of the most intense storms ever *in a single season*. Only two previous seasons have had two Category 5 storms (1960 and 1961). 2005 now has three, and for good measure they're all among the ten most intense storms. Ever.

Sea temperatures in the area of Wilma were over 30C yesterday. In mid-October. That's just not meant to happen.

On that evidence, the instant gut reaction is to blame global warming. Understandable, and at least it might make a few people think about what damage we're doing to the planet (not that it should take three monster hurricanes in two months to do that) but it can't be that simple - there's numerous other factors involved in the formation of hurricanes, and evidently far too many of them have been at work this year.

Still, I'd suspect global warming is one factor, even if it's only a small one - the most likely effect of continued global warming on the hurricane season is for storms to be formed further north (and that's a scary prospect in itself because another factor in hurricane development, the Coriolis effect, is greater at more northerly altitudes). And we must not forget that there are other effects that are far more easily attributable to global warming. But hurricanes are singular deadly events and that might explain why the simple explanation of global warming is being used as an explanation for how they are becoming more numerous and powerful in recent years."

"event","<i>1. When did you first start composing and what was your first composition?</i>
Six years ago in a music lesson the whole class had to write a pop song, and mine was merely bad rather than abysmal. However, I dropped music at this point, the first opportunity I had, mostly because I really wanted to do Business Studies and one from History or Geography (ended up picking the latter) and I wasn't really into music at that time. My composition really began in earnest in early 2003.

<i>2. Have you had any formal training and experience in singing? Have you taken lessons or sung in choirs?</i>
The simple answer is 'no'. With the exception of school choirs, and that when I was eight or so, I've not had any choral experience, and while I've contemplated singing lessons I've never had any. And it's unlikely I will now - if only because I see myself as being far better at writing music than I am at performing it!

<i>3. If you couldn't make music, would you still do something creative? What would it be?</i>
Difficult one. Most likely plain creative writing. Indeed, I still consider myself a lyricist first and a composer a distant second - but music and lyrics are inevitably entwined somewhat.

<i>4. How has your upbringing made you who you are today?</i>
In short, it's the source of all that has gone wrong in my life. My mum is frighteningly repressive (as in, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sir_quirky_k/2005/02/11"">trying to stop me going on a fifteen-minute train ride into the countryside at 18</a>. Yes, <i>that</i> repressive.) and that's crippled my self-esteem. It's also made me quite a social liberal in recent years as I see parallels between my Mum metaphorically strangling me and conservative government metaphorically strangling people in general (and their opponents in particular).

<i>5. Where do you see yourself in five years?</i>
Fleeing from major flooding in my coastal home town, if I'm still living there, and either way living in appalling squalor after a series of severe weather events in 2010 caused by a combination of El Nino and global warming.

"event","1. Name someone with the same birthday as you:
The ice hockey player Peter Forsberg.

2. Where was your first kiss?
I'm not even sure I've had one.

3. Have you ever seriously vandalized someone else's property?
I don't recall doing so.

4. Have you ever hit someone of the opposite sex?
No.

5. Have you ever sung in front of a large number of people?
I impersonated Avril Lavigne in front of about 200 people for a charity concert in 2002, and in early 2005 I performed one of my own songs - would have been more but for technical problems - in front of a similar number in the sixth form common room, again for charity (the tsunami appeal, as this was early 2005).

6. What's the first thing you notice about the preferred sex?
Their hair and clothing. It's their means of expressing individuality.

7. What really turns you on?
A switch?

8. What do you order at Starbucks?
I don't go to coffee shops and if I did it would most likely not be a chain.

9. What is your biggest mistake?
There's a few, but I'm not sure which would be my biggest.

10. Have you ever hurt yourself on purpose?
Yes, but only crushing damage - I've been afraid to use any more force than my own fists.

11. Say something totally random about yourself:
I'm hosting the 25th NationStates World Cup.

12. Has anyone ever said you looked like a celebrity?
I certainly don't remember as much.

13. Do you still watch kiddy movies or tv shows?
I rarely watch TV shows in the first place these days, apart from the odd quiz and sporting event. I've never watched many movies, but those that I do watch tend to be of the family-friendly 'cute animation + adult in-jokes' variety (most recent example: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory).

14. Did you have braces?
No.

15. Are you comfortable with your height?
Being 5'10"" is fine. Being 5'10"" and 9st0 isn't. Surely I'm meant to have a BIT of muscle?

16. What is the most romantic thing someone of the preferred sex has done for you?
Heh, I'm not sure I've been involved in anything romantic - I stick to platonic relationships myself.

17. When do you know it's love?
Define 'love'. As in romantic, or as in '<interest> is love' iconbars?

18. Do you speak any other languages? 
I have an A in GCSE German, but if I took it again now I'd be lucky to get an F.

19. Have you ever been to a tanning salon?
No.

20. What magazines do you read?
I don't tend to read magazines, tending instead towards LJ and other Internet sources for my reading fix.

21. Have you ever ridden in a limo?
No, and I passionately hate their dirty ways.

22. Has anyone you were really close to passed away?
Closest relatives to me who have died are two of my grandparents.

23. Do you watch MTV?
No, I don't have Sky.

24. What's something that really annoys you?
Watching chavs get jobs while I'm still unemployed.

25. What's something you really like?
Hearing floaty ethereal-sounding voices singing sad songs.

26. Do you like Michael Jackson?
He's ever-so-slightly mad, to say the least. Musically he's pretty good and could have been better if he was less crazy. But at least he vaguely cared about the planet.

27. Can you dance?
Does DDR count? If so then yes (5 foot player on DDR 5th Mix, 6 foot player on Dancing Stage Euromix 2), if not then no.

28. What's the latest you have ever stayed up?
Somewhere between the 12:30am I managed on Saturday night/Sunday morning and maybe 1am on another night, I'm not sure.

29. Have you ever been rushed by an ambulance into the emergency room?
Don't think so. Nearest I got was in July when I had appendicitis, when Mum picked me up from the GP's surgery and drove me to the hospital.

30. Do you actually read these when other people fill them out?
I have a manageably short friendlist, so more than likely yes.

"event","<i>1. What is your opinion on animal testing and gay marriage?</i>
Animal testing's a difficult one - and it did come up in Psychology A2. I'm against the use of animals to study human behaviour, it's bad science if nothing else - but I'm not so sure about medical uses, as the benefit is potentially great but by no means guaranteed. As for gay marriage, I'm in favour, as we should generally avoid discrimination based on personal preferences.

<i>2. Apart from songs and their lyrics, what else do you write?</i>
I've written a fair amount of roleplay in <a href=""http://www.nationstates.net"">NationStates</a>, mostly in the field of sports roleplaying. (My nation name there is Kaze Progressa, hence the name 'KP' that I often use online.) I've also done the odd stream-of-consciousness rant from time to time.

<i>3. What would you say is the best console and video game of all time?</i>
Ouch. I'm not sure I can round this down to one. Sensible Soccer on the Amiga was gloriously addictive in its simplicity, The Sims is a glorious concept brilliantly executed with style and humour, and - while I hate cars - the Gran Turismo series has to be admired for its astonishing detail without sacrificing the element of fun. I'll go with Sensible Soccer as my all-time favourite.

<i>4. What would you say is the love of your life at the moment?</i>
Also tough, as the concept of 'love' is rather alien to this cynical mind. When I get my new PC I suspect that'll be the love of my life, but for now I'm not sure I have one.

<i>5. Where do you see yourself 20 years from now?</i>
Living in a temporary town, with disease and crime endemic, after my home town is completely flooded in the summer of 2025 - rising sea levels from global warming being exacerbated by a succession of severe thunderstorms. That's if I survive. Yes, that's rather dystopian, but I can see it happening."

"event","<i>1. What musical instruments do you play and which is your favorite?</i>
I've not been formally taught in anything but I've picked up a bit of piano myself, to the point where at least I can improvise and create melodies. You know how many pianists are incidentally fast typists because the finger movements aren't dissimilar? I guess the reverse is true of me *giggle*. I've considered learning to play the acoustic guitar too. I prefer the piano though, on the grounds that it's incredibly versatile.

<i>2. Do you have perfect pitch? If so, is it a blessing or a curse?</i>
I don't, far from it. Not sure to what extent I'd enjoy having it. Probably I'd prefer 'good enough to be absolutely sure of singing in tune' :)

<i>3. What is your favorite vacation spot? Then pick three places you've never been that you would like to visit.</i>
I live in a tourist town myself but that's definitely not it! I liked my one and only excursion from England, to Mallorca off the Spanish coast, but the climate doesn't agree with me. I'd probably pick Brighton as a favourite holiday location (*notes Anglo-American spelling variations*) for fresh sea air and liberal politics. I'd like to go to Manchester (partly to meet <lj user=""shinydan""> and others, but also because it's big enough to be an interesting city without being oppressive like London); to the Lake District for a peaceful atmosphere in which to indulge in creativity; and to Hull, as a fine example of a city that mixes the aging, crumbling docks with new development such as <a href=""http://www.kcstadium.co.uk/"">the wonderful KC Stadium</a>.

<i>4. If you had a special person over for dinner, what would you cook?</i>
Does a beef bourgignon of hardline Republicans count? If not, then I'd probably lean towards something very simple, like pasta and vegetables, artfully arranged.

<i>5. Who/what are your three main musical influences?</i>
Sarah McLachlan for the crystalline simplicity and clarity of many of her songs, as well as the voice that sings them; Thom Yorke of Radiohead, for showing no fear in experimenting (or, for that matter, in writing sad songs with a powerful message); and I'm going to have to say <lj user=""pianoscry""> for turning what could be seen as a weakness (her range of only two octaves) into a strength (keeping melodies simple and - by implication - ridiculously catchy!). :)

"event","1) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.

2) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.

3) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.

4) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.

5) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Brittany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.

6) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.

7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.

8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.

9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.

10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.

Can you smell the sarcasm? Please post this in your journal if you are for gay marriage.

1. A structural or behavioral characteristic peculiar to an individual or group.

2. A physiological or temperamental peculiarity.

3. An unusual individual reaction to food or a drug.


List five of your own idiosyncrasies and then tag five friends to do the same.</i>

1. I have Asperger's Syndrome, a variant of autism that is responsible for a list of idiosyncrasies too long to mention. I thus list it as one, just to cover all bases!
2. I dislike bananas, but love banana-flavoured milk. I am now avoiding Nesquik as it is made by Nestle, who have an evil corporate record (<lj user=""lizzip""> and others will no doubt approve) but getting cheap, inferior alternatives from Aldi instead!
3. I generally dislike fruit, but can spend an entire day munching at grapes.
4. I have a particular passion for stadium architecture - a rather unusual specialism, but one I think fits because not only are these buildings grand in scale and focal points for thousands of people, but they are (or at least were) very often ugly!
5. I love all things silver - and my room is positively full of silver objects: bed, floor, handles and stencils on the chests of drawers, TV/DVD, CD player, digital radio, shelving, new magnetic board... all silver. I think I've missed a few too!

Tagging isn't something I do. I'll leave it up to you to decide if you want to do this meme. Hell, I wasn't tagged for this myself."

America - the most classist, racist society I can imagine. It makes me sick.

Oh, and I saw a source from Taiwan saying that New Orleans may be remembered in history as the first major city in the developed world to be lost to global warming. Sad as it is to say it... that may be the truth. And it may be the first, but not necessarily the last.

<i>BTW - my mood refers to Those Who Have Power. I think a majority of my LJ friends are from America. All of them have far more sense than Those Who Have Power, and many of them have been fighting passionately against this administration from the beginning. I applaud them. And if this crisis causes the end of Bush's ill-deserved and abysmally-handled presidency, then while America will still be a nation in crisis and thousands will still have died as a direct result of Bush's cuts to flood protection, these people will not have died in vain. It's just an astonishing tragedy that it takes something like this for it to even be remotely conceivable.</i>"

"event","Occasionally, I have idly thought to myself 'I need an arranger'. This thought is due to the fact that I'm pretty good at writing lyrics, and not that bad at writing melodies, but not at all knowledgable regarding what different instruments do, etc etc. - the kind of knowledge arrangers live on.

And I thought to myself 'there ought to be *someone* who has that knowledge but doesn't do much composition. Then we have an ideal collaboration.'

That someone was <lj user=""lauradalloway"">. And she just happened to be considering the writing of a musical, only to be unable to think up a plot.

As many of you will know, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sir_quirky_k/2004/11/07/"">I had a plot for a musical already</a> (which I'd actually planned in some depth), but I only did a couple of songs for it.

I scarcely need to tell you the rest.

Yes, we're going to be working on that together. :)

sirquirkyk: Am I the only one who thinks that in a few years, contraltos will be an endangered species, squeezed out by males singing their parts and soprani getting all the attention?
requiella: I think that's already happened!

The discussion then: <i>Has it already happened? If not, is it likely to happen? And should we be trying to stop it from happening?</i>"

I've been experimenting - this partially-completed song has been written differently to anything else I've written. Previously I've focused on the melodies, but (thanks mostly to <lj user=""pianoscry"">, I must admit!) I started this song with a chord progression. Not that I knew what I was doing - though this isn't unusual! :)

Yay for the 'Arrange' (read: intelligent copy/paste) feature in Sibelius - this is how the string parts were added, though I changed the repeated notes into one sustained note and changed the last bar slightly.

Now, to think up lyrics. :D

<i>Edit - I've now got it to work as an .htm file, and it appears at a decent size too. Also, have added more to it - it's now pretty much complete musically, though the ending is still a bit rough - I'll play with that more.</i>"

"event","So I haven't touched this blog in about two months... maybe I've been braindead or maybe I've just been busy... I'm not sure but I guess I haven't had any ideas I felt worthy of explicating.  Anyway, here I am in Philadelphia, truly my most favoritist city in the whole nation, and I can't stand the reason for my being here: scholarly conferences.  I'd so much rather be out riding a borrowed bike around the city that be sitting in a room in some posh hotel listening to a group of speakers I'm probably not interested in.  The first problem I guess is the low quality of work I have seen so far in the conferences at which I've been.  The ASAs are my biggest and supposedly best yet, but I have nejoyed each subsequent experience less.  Perhaps I just choose the wrong sessions... maybe I pick poor scholars or the topics in which I am interested in attract subpar people.  Maybe... but since I've seen some famous people here in Philly, that hypothesis does not seem to be as well supported as I might have expected.  Case in point: Elijah Anderson, one of my favorite writers, definitely my favorite urban ethnographer.  I saw him yesterday in a session that was all about the African American experience in Philadelphia past and present.  The author of Streetwise and Code of the Streets had home field advantage since he lives and does his fieldwork in Philly.  This guy is fmaous as far as sociologists go!  I was so excited when he got up to speak, but then he started to ramble on about the structural issues that had caused Philadelphia to look as it does today... everyone in the room already was aware of these factors - they were sociologists and white flight/deindustrialization is something all of them can be expected to comprehend.  But he spent maybe 15 minutes on the topic rambling on and on, obviously without the aid of any prepared notes.  Worse, he was taping himself rambling and it took him the first minute of his time to just figure out how to turn the damn thing on.  Then, for the next fifteen minutes (he got double the time of everyone else because of his status), he realayed fairy pedestrian anecdotes he had from hanging out around town doing ""fieldwork"", which according to him is eating oyster soup in the Reading Terminal Market and sitting in the park at Rittenhouse Square.  He was trying to make some kind of poin t about how what he calles ""urban canopies"", places where lots of diverse people come together in a common utilitarian cosmopolitan space, foster civility among groups that might otherwise have significant animosites towards one another.  He capped this discussion with something he learned one day at the park when it started to poor and he had to take refuge in a nearby Barnes and Noble with fellow patrons: homeless people smell - did you know that?  He also said ""if you know what I mean"" about as much as Master P used to say ""ya heard"" which was also surprising.  The moral of this story: some people who seem like geniuses on paper either can't or don't care to prepare enough to do the same in an oral presentation.  Most of the time, PowerPoint doesn't help much either.  It wasn't just this guy, it was most people (myself probably included - except at least I had a novel idea) who were boring, inarticulate, or simply had crap material.  In the best sessions I've attended, perhaps half of the speakers I might consider worth my time.  I think most people hate these conferences too - the grad students I know do at least - and if they change their minds a decade down the road I would have to chalk that up to socialization, not higher education.  I went to someones talk today that was on the importance of mantlepieces and what they represent, except for the person didn't actually conclude anything - but she showed picures, relayed anecdotes, and called it ethnography.  I can't really understand a lot of foreign scholars t whom English is their second language.  In fact, the only really good presentations I can remember were both from ASA president Troy Duster, who is unusually articulate and knows how to use multimedia.  If you have to be that special or that seasoned to make my experience even halfway enjoyable, perhaps we should reconsider a cahnge in format.  For people who just ramble, maybe they should blog instead.  For people with troubles in the public speaking or enunciation department, perhaps they should relay more information to us visually.  God willing, I won't attend anymore conferences.  While it is a great excuse to travel, unless you find a local to show you around, you'll see nothing but your fellow colleagues, other stuffy old sociologists, and the local tourist traps downtown.  Furthermore, it is an expoensive operation with all the flights, accomodations, and eating (and drinking) out involved.  Thankfully, I save about thirty dollars a day here by refusing to schmoose at bars.  That's wat most people come for anyway - to network - get seen, maybe even get hired.  For the old guns, it's become a time to see old friends still making the circuit and maybe to get praised by younger folks looking for a hand up in their careers.  I'm not career oriented and I'm still stuck on trying to distance myself from the academic bourgeoisie, so these events are not for me.  I would much rather spend my time purusing recent releases of multimedia presentations from scholars I think I might dig after reading about their background and interests.  This could all be accomplished so much more effiently and remotely if it was just more electronically oriented.  I know this seems to be my answer to a growing number of issues these days, but really, this conference thing seems like an old boys club from the fifties.  Imagine: no time limits, no accent barriers, hyperlinks to the actual paper and other related research... it sounds like heaven.  There could still be audio and there could still be interaction.  If you have a question simply call, email, or even visit the person... its not like these conference sessions run over time because the audience has such enlightened and probing questions to ask right on the spot.  The format sucks, period!  It's time to change it, but I wonder how much of the proffessional association would survive without this event to fill their coffers and publicize (read: laud over all inferior others) their importance.  Its a problem of power and tradition and once again my chosen solution is collective nonparticipation.  I'm a member of the ASA, but I'll be damned if I pay them $100 to go to their events.  If I happen to want to travel to their city and listen in, I'll be sneaking in... and I'll publicize my less anonomous self somewhere else that's even better accesible - the Internet."

"event","So I'm sitting up late at night in my house while some people from out of town have a good old time on my front porch.  I've got nothing against a good time and the activity really isn't inconveniencing me since I can't sleep anyways, but I wonder about their motivations.  I feel like I probably grew out of the ""stay up late drinking playing word games"" thing maybe five years ago, but perhaps I never actually was into it at all.  I watch people shape their entire early twenties existence around this lifestyle and just wonder why?  Is this really all that we can think to do with ourselves at this point in our lives?  How many other people are out there doing this - how many people are up late writing instead like me?  I don't want to look down on people, but I can't help but think that there must be something better to do with our time.  I guess this all the more true when you engage in these activities on such a regular basis that they all tend to blend together in your mind.  While I can't say that the events of my nights (and days for that matter) don't as well, at least I have some evidence to show some differentiation and hopefully even a little bit of progress.  Progress in what you may ask - a discipline, understanding the world, understanding yourself?  To me, these all represent the same process, but most people place lots of boundaries around them.  There's work and then there's play and the there's the stuff you do to advance your existence.  When I say that all my days blend together, I'm not saying that  my life is meaningless or monotonous, but that they all seem to be uniformly tracked along the same path.  I'm running a straight line with very few ups and downs (artificially induced or not) and very little that the outside world imposes on me.  Instead, I've tried to craft an existence that is as uncoerced and unforced as possible.  I do the same things whether some institution pays me to do them or not.  There are very few things that I enjoy immensely in the world, but I hope to integrate them all into this effortless, even keel life of mine."

"event","My friend Raj just sent me one of the most interesting NPR stories I've ever heard on an inner city debate team that raps.  You have to listen to the story to see how smart these kids and their opponents really are - http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kcur/news.newsmain?action=article&ARTICLE_ID=780072 .  I wrote a lecture on a book called Emprire for my class last semester and I think very few of the students understood what the hell I was talking about, but these kids seem to have read that book and its follow up overnight - not that they had a very good grasp of the material - just that they were able to get into it at all.  It once again helped me see how much interesting media gets past me everyday.  The vast amount of information our technology now have available to us is still far too decentralized and unordered to really be of much help in our daily lives.  I scour the main NPR website everyday, but I wouldn't have found that story because it appeared on a local station's site and I would have had to know what I was looking for to find it on my own.  I think it is incredibly important for people who are interested in similar kinds of things to develop social structures in online forums that allow for an efficient division of labor in information harvesting.  That is, the same way that techies have Slashdot, people interested in social innovation should have a place for ourselves as well.  This wouldn't just be a news dump, but that would be a great start.  You could assign people to cover different media outlets (newspapers, magazines, websites, radio, television, movies, docfilm, books, academic journals, and foreign outlets of these kinds) that relate to their personal as well as professional development.  Their reason for participating would be to simply get their name posted as a contributor in a specific area and to recieve special consideration of their commentary submissions.  I guess one core problem would be how to keep definitions of our interests coherent because the ever expanding frontiers of information produce concomitant specialization trends that reward people for knowing a tiny body of knowledge that very few other people have access to.  I thought about that for awhile, and I think the solution is pretty simple - go the same route as Amazon and Netflix - just plug in lots of descriptors for the pieces of media that you carry and let algorithms sort out what people would like to see based on their previou picks (so the system would of course use a manual search feature as well.  I think I would be very interested in participating in such a forum (as long as I get to vary my mandatory media coverage once in a while - I don't want to have time for nothing but sociology journals.  Also, we could monitor the breadth of our search net by simply providing a space for people to say that they saw something that slipped through undetected by contributors - then we could threaten to replace them for slacking.  Also, we could allow commentaries by those contributors and the general public through a submission system like Slashdot uses to populate its forums.  I think this would really be a dramatic improvement over existing means of searching for info that one finds interesting - there is simply too much junk out there in news databases, google and other search engines, the blogosphere, RSS feeds, and academic databases.  I always get sidetracked and hoodwinked into wasting my time searching and evaluating quality while the entire process could be streamlined.  Again, it is a bit difficult to draw a topical boundary for how wide this organization would cast its saerch net if the topic of interest was defined as ""socially relevant info"".  However, I would guess that in a paragraph or so, one could outline a basic mission statement and perhaps even devise a rubric to judge whether certain materials fit in or not (we could of course make exceptions where needed).  I can imagine visiting a site like this in the near future, but hopefully it won't be plastered with silly banner ads becuase some corporate sleazeball co-opted the whole open source spirit of the idea."

"event","I think my job is to produce information: novel ideas, synthesis of older ones, scientific testing, etc.  But I have had increasing trouble with just being able to get myself to write anything of substantive meaning and I wonder why this is.  On one hand, I could speculate from a behaviorist perspective that work doesn't give me enough reinforcement during the process of doing it nd that I have not been sufficiently well acclimated to delayed gratification in this sphere of my life.  I guess this could explain why I think of so many good ideas which give me intrinsic pleasure (because I immeadiately share them with folks who at somewhat appreciate them), but have much more difficulty hashing out a final product.  Also, I envision what that final product would likely do for my life and my ambitions and I oftentimes can't see how it will serve to advance my life visions other than giving me professional credentials in academia.  For these reasons, my stallouts are pretty frequent.  I also wonder about the nature of technology that I use.  I like more passive mediums because they require anything of me but my attention.  However, I feel guilty when I watch TV, movies, read the news, or spend time reading Eastern philosophy because I know that these activities do not constitute work that is truly ""productive"" or constructive.  Granted, i learn things about the world and alter my perception of it, but I really have nothing to show for it.  Part of my interest in Eastern spiritual traditions likely comes out of this insecurity with my current levels of professional productivity - Buddhists and Taoists can give me the excuse that I'm hankering for - all my work is really based on an elaborate illusion and I should spend more time trying to see through the charade than I shuld in playing a half-ass role in it.  At a deeper level, I think the feeling of guilt is really central... I've been telling people for years now that I have come to the realization that most of my life is motivated by guilt (and fear).  I wake up in the morning not thinking about how tired I am or what I have dreamt of, but instead what time it is and if I have slept longer than 8 hours.  Of course, the thought that ineveitably awakens me is that I have and that I should feel guilty for having slept longer than other less fortunate people who have to get up and go to work.  I feel this guilt throughout the day as I do (or fail to do) what I believe should constitute a fulfilled day for a person like me (I make checklists that I hate to look at and almost never follow).  I harbor this guilt all day unless I am doing something that I can believe is worthy - which is a substantial portion of the day.  It is not that I have a encompassing pathological feeling of guilt, but just that when it does arise, it spoils my quality of life and doesn't appear to push me closer to accomplishing my goals.  And sometimes it sours what I am doing, because I am thinking instead of what I should be doing according to my productivity rubric.  I wonder how many other people feel this way - thinking their world is rife with media and vices used to get one off track and laptops that taunt you when you are not typing out meaningful information on them... but at least I can still bget some guiltless pleasures from writing these kinds of introspective essays - thank guiltless for that!"

"event","I think we can all agree about the potential dangers of routine.  We've all been in that situation where we must consider exactly what it is about our lifestyle that is furthering our drive towards a happy and meaningful life.  Self examination of this nature is perhaps the easy part of the equation, though... what is far more difficult is finding an effective way to construct a new mode of living.  Many people don't really have the luxury of making these tough choices on the path of personal growth - they just have to do what they have to do, day in and day out.  However, those of us in my boat shouldn't dwell too long on guilt stemming from their privilege to have these life crises and remain moderately shiftless in the process.  Instead, we should be trying to find better ways to reconceptualize our lives so that we can do something better with them... and maybe even do something that would open up the possibility for more disadvantaged others to start their own crises and voyages of self discovery.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I really do enjoy listening to others who have lost their way in the world.  The point at which nothing seems to make enough sense to go on with the charade of daily life is an inspiring moment indeed.  Its potential to change individuals and society as a whole is limitless indeed.  To this end, I wish to extend the illumination of this anomic (from anomie - normlessness) torch to others as a gesture of renewal, but at the same time, I feel guilty about destabilizing others' reality maps without offering them a tried and true path towards reconceptualize their life.  I don't know whether it was harder in the past to go about this mission or if these crises occurred much less often (probably both), but there remains today a large amount of ambiguity about which strategy is the right one.  Should we find God, renounce our possessions, break up with loved ones, go travel, join a cult, get on a crazy exercise program, cleanse my colon with maple syrup and cayenne pepper, take a vow of silence and contemplation, move to a new town, go back to school, get a guru, etc.?  Again, fragmented identities make this a difficult task on which to get consistent advice.  What perhaps makes this even more difficult is that the crises may not arise within consistent demographic groups.  Educated men in there early 20s may still be the prime category since privilege likely is the strongest predicting factor, but I find it probable that the disaffected come from much more diverse places in society and the life course these days.  What I hope to propose here is a social invention that could aid in these transition periods of life, but the diversity of the audience will likely make this all the more difficult.  However, if we were to suppose that there are specific variables that can predict how successful an individual will be in their transition period, then such a model would be able to take demographic diversity into account.  In fact, it would probably compose a key feature.  Our society has been frequently been criticized by the likes of anthropologists and ecopsychologists for lacking rituals which would make transitions in the life course a more coherent social project than what we currently experience in modern societies today.  It does seem strange to prescribe any one path to personal growth in a society as diverse as ours.  While we may not want to tell people to go out in the woods for a week by themselves, there can be at least some degree of continuity in the diversity many of us cherish.  If we can establish some kind of universalistic description of life course transition, then it should be possible to judge practices that may seem very different, but contain very similar core elements.  Actually, being a sociologist of life transitions doesn't seem like such a crazy thing to study.  It could turn out to be a fairly hairball grounded theory study, but that wouldn't be all bad for my continuing training.  And hey, what better place to get it started than in a college town with graduating students, many of whom are likely on the cusp of such a crisis anyway."

"event","It appears to me that perhaps the key change that the internet has made
possible is the exchange of goods, services, and ideas outside of
institutionalized or overt contractual obligations. Granted, we all
check the button below the huge disclaimer documents indicating that we
understand what we can and cannot hold certain folks liable for, but
just because the legalese is still omnipresent does not mean that it is
as important as it once was in more traditional settings. Some of the
examples I'm thinking of are the online auction houses, internet
retailers, and accommodation sharing sites like couchsurfing.org. The
latter is perhaps the most impressive, though it is used much less
frequently and has nothing to do with economic transaction. Still, the
idea that individuals can come to an agreement over sharing personal
space via just a mediated forum with some pictures could certainly be
perceived as an accomplishment. This comes at a time when there is more
outcry than ever over our declining social capital networks and our
general alienation from people around us. How can this be? What does it
tell us about the future? Two concepts feature prominently here... One
is the growth of networking technology. The idea that we can judge the
trustworthiness of others through assessment of their previous
interactions with folks we know was for the longest time the central
rule governing all relationships between individuals in and across
communities within every society. The rise of ""mass society"" and its
institutions (edu, news/entertainment, professional associations)
substituting for personal relations and the general individualization
of our lives through growth of the suburban mentality is widely thought
to be responsible for this trend over the last century. Also, the
general consolidation and growth of businesses into the giant corporate
chain entities we deal with today certainly depersonalized matters
further. However, the internet has now made it possible for individuals
interested in niche products and services to be able to once again
transact with one another on the basis of their shared network
affiliations and overall reputation accrued in a particular medium.
With ideas like accommodation sharing and general friend-finding
services like this one, the catalyst seems more often to be lifestyle
matching. My contention is that identity fragmentation is one of the
key features of today's world. While of course we can still make very
accurate predictions about the dimensions of a person's life from their
general demographic characteristics, it is becoming ever more difficult
to predict the nuances of individual identity. I believe this is
especially true amongst the most privileged and educated segments of
the population, whom I am currently speaking to almost exclusively.
When a person moves in down the street from you, you cannot tell much
about the way that that person views the world until you either get a
chance to ask them point blank or a chance to inventory their
possessions which would offer insights into their cultural and
subcultural affiliations. Compare this to the potential accuracy of the
predictions being made on the same block fifty years ago and I think
you will see my point. Our society will only diversify further and
identity projects will continue to become so as well. What social
software has made provided is an easy way to catalogue personal
interests and thus describe our identity. We love to do this anyway...
""Please interview me."" This ability to assess the lifestyle of others
quickly has made the transitions from digitally to actual interaction
not only possible, but perhaps much more productive than the game of
chance in real world encounters. The feedback dimension makes provides
a heck of a lot of data for future interaction with other parties and
thus the cycle continues. What I hope will happen in the future is that
these evolving interaction possibilities will make it easier for people
to escape the bonds of geography, demography, and professional
specialization and seek out distant others who could potentially enrich
their lives. Social networking software provides a means to weaken
other older institutionalized contractual bonds and make these
adventures possible outside of the commodified tourist model."

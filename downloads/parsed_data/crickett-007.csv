"event","why is it that sometimes in your live you start to wonder just where you are going? what you have done or what you want to do? and when things seem to be going right , nothing is going right? i have been looking for the woman of my dreams, or just someone to click with but where is she? 
as far as direction? well lets see, im waiting on sarpy county to call me to proceed with the hiring process. i got a call to talk to NP DODGE the real estate company, and then the lady from GREAT ESCAPES, then there is going back to school.
i dont knwo what i want to do or what im gonna do, but i do know that i want to get out of the resturant business, i need something that i can advance at.
as far as women go? i dunno there are a few that i am interested in but i dont know where they stand, and i hate that. maybe one will say something maybe not."

"event","To say that today was like any other day would be a lie, but then again, what can i say, i lie.
my name is Keighvin Maxwell, and i am a professional. what do i do you ask? i collect small claims for big clients. life is pretty easy, i have a house on the beach, a dog, a nice car, and more money than i can ever count to. women who flock to me when i enter a room. i have my own table at a very fine resturant.everything is perfect in my life.
then..i wake up.
ok ok so i work at a pancake house, my car smells like old fish, my little studio apartment is falling apart, my dog is a stuffed animal, and i never have any money. my girlfriend is pregnant by someone else, i drink too much. oh and my name is Stan.
but when my day is over, the lights go out, i return to another world, where i am the man, where i am Keighvin Maxwell. But like i said, today was not like any other day, for me or for Mr Maxwell.
""Stan...STAN!!""
""What? im up im up, what the hell do you want?""
""you have a table""
""yeah yeah im getting there, back off..damn slave driver""
i walked to the table and there sat a well dressed man, i mean he looked like he walked right out of a James Bond movie or something. Short cut hair, pin striped suit, not the average looking person that would eat at a place like this. his suit was pressed, and he sat up strait, even the little hanki in his pocket seemed to stand up. he waved a finger at me, not looking up, the universal signal to hold the fuck on. he hung up his phone and looked at me, through sunglasses that were probably more than what i make in a month. he raised an eyebrow as if to tell me to continue.
""Welcome to Pancake Palace, Im Stan can i start you with a fresh glass of orange juice?"" i always hated saying that but hey policy is policy. Then this guy removes his glasses ans smiles at me, so im thinking he has to be gay or something. He reaches out his hand as if to shake mine. i kinda stare at him, looking rather stupid, before i shake his hand, not knowing what else to do.
""At last we meet Mr. Maxwell, it is a pleasure to finally meet you""
So i know what your guessing, this is right out of that Matrix movie with that guy from Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure, how do you think i feel? so im looking at this guy, he's looking at me and i dont know what to say.                                                       ""Can i intrest you in the pancake super egg sandwhich combo for 5.99"" oh yeah that was really stupid..."

"event","not much going on, i called sarpy county, they said that they were still doing background checks and that they are setting up in home interviews next week some time. if i get on sarpy county then everything will be great. i will have a good job, no a career.
then i can get the car i want and all the toys i need. i can take better care of ashleigh, and giver her everything she wants.
so my plan? do sarpy ocunty for a while, and go to school. i dont know about federal, but i would be just as happy on SWAT. then i hope to get with day in the future and onpen a personal perotection agency.
i want a house on the beach, that opens to the water. i want to be able to walk out my back door and go surfing or whatever.
i want to be in a serious relationship, just me and ONE woman. heh
the more you want the harder it is to get it."

"event","humm, now its monday but i did not do anything in here yesterday so this is for sunday. 
well dave and them woke me up to go to lunch, and shopping for stuff to build the bar. no big deal pretty cool actually cuz now the bar is built and i just spent 100 bucks on booze and we plan on spending about 200 more. ans that is just the booze, not to mention the other stuff, like garnich and all the goofy stuff, blender etc.
as for the rest of the basement, we still gotta get a pool table and then a dart board, then i want to get more lites, i love lites, and a fog machine and humm what else? i really dont know, ill have to look and get back at ya.

i have not heard form skyler today, but then again she did have her daughter today so thats cool. i wish that she would let me meet her kid but i kinda understand. she does not want her daughter seeing guys come in and out of her life, so i guess i see her hesitation.

well it comes down to two girls, wither emmy or skyler, either one but never both. i have never had two girls interested in me at the same time. i dont know what to do, i do but i dont, i want skyler but having her is hard, but worth it. but see the ting about it is that i dont really know where we stand. are we a thing, or is she having fun or what? either way i wish she would let me know. i know that i should take my time with this but it is just so frustrating sometimes, to want to be close to someone that doesnt know if they want you to be or not.

but on a lighter note, i did some drinking saturday night which was kinda cool cept it did not take much for me to get a little tipsy, not much at all. funny. but its all good, i hope that once we get the basement together we can start having parties, im gonna get a grill so that we can have BBQs during the summer.

i sitll have not heard from Sarpy County yet but everyday i cross my fingers and toes, i mean if i was not a candidate then would they not have told me already? i dunno how that works. im gonna call tomarrow and find out how things are going. cross fingers for me that i get it."

"event","well today was the first v-day i was with someone, although i dont know if we are technicly ""together"" but i know when she is here i cannot keep my hands off of her, not she off of me.

she was the first to ever give me something for v-day. she got me a card and carnatins. i got her 6 purple roses and 2 baloons and candy for the little one.

she did write that she likes me and whats to know more. so perhaps there is hope for us yet, and if there is then all these other women i talk to can take a hike. i have enjoyed the attention but i want something more than just flirting. 

i always want what i cannot have and i usually get what i want eventually, and i have to try sooooo hard to get it. but this one im gonna take my time, cuz i want this.

on a lighter note, kinda, i did not have a bad dream last night, mostly cuz i only slept for a little but at a time, but at least no bad dreams, i guess i did not sleep long enough to fall into REM to get to a dream.

but i did wake up thinking of skyler(betsieiiy)(betsy), i think i am falling for her but am i? i dunno. but if there is a chance for us long term, i will let everyone know that. huh, wow im sounding all wierd, kinda like i was back when i first met cindy.

but hey one day at a time, i dont want to rush this but i want it so bad. maybe that is why we connected. who knows, we both want the same thing from the other person, so huh. maybe i can only hope."

"event","yet another bad dream, i dont kow why i have so many, and i dont know what the hell they are trying to tell me, if anything.
this one was pretty simple, but bad enough to wake me up.
again i was alone and running, more ""james bondish"" this time, guns and planting bombs, shooting, and more running.
then im on and island, i see the ""uss minnow"" so im thinking an episode of gilligans island. but the trees are moving, as if something enormous is crashing through them. im surrounded by men in all black.
im in a cell of some kind, i look out the barred window, im very high up. then im out on the ledge, edging my way around a building. now im running again through a city, there is fog everywhere so im thinking london, i hear the clicking of claws again, where is my gun?
ahead i see a figure in all white, she calls to me, hand stretched out, as if wanting to lead me away.
i catch up to her, she takes my hand and leads me through walls, i notice that she is more floating than running.finally we stop and she turns to me, her cloak covers her face, i try to ask who she is but she shakes her head, her small pale hands reach up to cup my face. then they go to the hood of her cloak as if about to reveal herself. wen she trhows the hood back there is nothing there, i try to scream out but i cant.
i wake up in bed, not mine, there is an arm around me that grips me tight, i smiled and settled back down and turn to face who im sleeping with.
when i turn over i scream and wake up. i only remember after i am fully awake what i saw, she was deterriorated, as if she was decomposing, i dont know who it was...wierd"

"event","so i tried to go to bed like a normal person only to be awaken by a bad dream again. so i thought this would be a good place to logg my dreams as well.

it started out in a fog of some sort, i didnt know where i was, but as always im running from something with a pistol in my had, the same pistol everytime. only this time it is clear and i can see the magazine and each shell and the one in the chamber. only this time the shell casings are silver and the actual bulletts are bright red, glowing like a fire in my palm.
i hear something comming after me, the sound is like a dog running across the kitchen floor, so i know whatever it is it has claws. there is no growling so a wherewolf is out so perhaps it is some other creature.
shots are fired nearly grazing my head, i fire back but the trigger is so heavy, it takes two fingers to pull it back, the round screams off into the fog like a red ember flailing through the darkness.
then im in my car, trying to drive from the back seat, i cannot reach the wheel. the car slams into a tree and i black out.(is it possibel to black out in a dream?)
i wake up in my house but i am bound to a chair, gaged, i can hear a comotion but there is something over my eyes, there are faint wispers and a loud explosion, i feel heat rip through my arms and chest, shouting and gun fire, there is a presence over me, i can feel someone tugging at my bonds, more gun fire and yelling , i can never make out what is being said. 
my gag is removed and my blindfold is ripped from my face, im staring into a mirror, no im staring at myself.
my savior self pulls a gun, the clear one, with red shells, and points it at my head ""nunquam aspectus remeo"" and pulls the trigger, and i wake up in a sweat.
i dont know how i remember but i looked up what i said to myself before i shot myself. ""never look back"" odd how i would remember that. but i did take latin in school. but me shooting myself, what the hell does that mean?"

"event","not much going on, i hate work and im still waiting for sarpy county to call me back. i still dont know whats going on with skyler, but i am working on it.
i have started posting stuff on the art board on SLAM, people seem to like it, have gotten a lot of positive feed back, so thats good.
im getting tired of the snow, it is too cold. 
im getting tired of working stupid jobs for pennys, i need a real one soon and fast. 

and in the end, all i can think about is skyler, if she is the one then i will remain loyal to her and stop talking to all the other girls i talk to"

"event","I dont know what is going on between skyler and i, although i know what i would like to happen. we have spent two magical nights together and we talk on the phone for hours. yet i dont know if we are an exclusive thing or not. i dont want to push the subject but i kinda want to know where we stand.
she is everything and anything that i could ever want in somebody and even more, she has goals and has her head on strait. not to mention that she is one of the most beautiful women i have ever been with. but again i want to know but i dont want to push things.
i have found that i think about her all the time, she is the last thought im my head before i go to sleep and the first though when i wake up every morning. we are a perfect match but how do i know if it is real or if she is just having fun with me, thats the only part i hate. the not knowing. are we a couple, because if we are i will act accordingly, or are we just having a good time.
in the end i know what i am looking for and i know what she says she is looking for,and we both fit each others wants and desires."

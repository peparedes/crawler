"event","Guess what i got...a new WATER BED!! =) i've wanted one for so long but never thought the day would come. But yesterday while i was at Universal my parents surprised me with it. I had the best nights sleep last night, there's something about the feel and sound of a water bed that soothes me. It's awesome. You should come try it!

Today was a pretty boring day. I stayed inside, watched the news, eat, cleaned my room, and did all this while talking on the phone. I feel like i'm locked up in a prison though with all the windows boarded up, i need some air, but i'm sure we'll be getting plenty of it when the hurricane comes. I'm still soo confused about what's happening though because they change the projected path before i even comprehend the first one. It's crazy.

I really wanna get my nails done soon...BUT my mom won't pay for me to get them done anymore because it's either nails or waxing and i chose waxing. I need a job. Or some old rich guy. By the way i need some new Steve Madden high heel shoes to go with my new underwear. Anyone feeling generous? lol

Well if we don't all die, i'll write in here sometime after the hurricane...

<3 Always

"event","Once upon a time there was a girl. She liked this guy. He liked her too. It was special, also different. He felt love for the first time, and never let go...

What i've been up to lately...doing things to prepare for hurricane Frances even though it's probably gonna end up not even hitting us. There's supposed to be winds between 75-85 mph and a lot of rain hitting us but before the news said only rain so i'm completely oblivious to what's going on now :-\

This morning i thought since the hurricane's supposed to be coming that today was just gonna be a boring day. So after being woken up at 8 in the morning by my mom and made to look after my lil brother for 2 hours which was supposed to be 5 mins(!!) i decided to take a nap since i could bearly keep my eyes open. Then after about 5 mins Jessica D calls me to find out if i wanna go to Universal with her. So i had to get up and ready in an hour! Universal was a lot of fun though, even though i nearly died of heat. For once i was actually wearing jeans and then my english football shirt - which btw some British people noticed =) It was soo awesome we were like surrounded by British people there, Jessica was like the only American haha. It was so weird, i was talking to Jessica about how Americans interpret Scotland and then England. I don't see why they seem to think of Scotland and England as one whole country when it's not. In fact they're completely different. But i guess yall are incapable of understanding that from all the way over here. I don't know it just kinda gets to me sometimes when people say stupid shit and thinks it's funny but whatever. 

But OMG today at Universal there was this LITTLE kid who was touching his MOM'S butt!! Like he went over, rubbed it a little, grabbed it, then rubbed it some more...and this went on for like 15 mins and the woman was just smiling away as though it was perfectly normal!! Is it just me or is that totally messed up?!?

Lately i've been thinking that i may be losing some of my good friends :-\ they think that i don't wanna hang out with them, i wanna hang out with my 'driving friends' but that's COMPLETELY not true. I just find my own thing to do now because they always seem to be hanging out together without me. Not that i'm saying that i should be invited everywhere because that would be totally selfish but they always seem to be doing everything just them, so why should i impose? I don't know...i don't know how they feel so i don't know what to do about it. I just hope they understand that they're not just back ups and i really do like hanging out with them and that i luv them to death...seriously! I mean friends have been a difficult thing for me because of moving from Scotland to here, it was really hard to make all new friends and you guyz were the first big group of friends that i had and that means a lot to me. So just please don't think that i don't wanna hang out with you okay?

"event","Well things with my step-dad turned out uhh...okay? Things went a little different than planned because i kind of said some things to him on friday morning which were kinda mean :-\ he deserved it though. 

Other than that things have been pretty cool. I went to the mall and got new stuff, it wasn't my fault i seriously couldn't help it...even ask Jessica! I finally hung out with Jaimie again! Me, her, Marc, and Dexter all went to the mall and then movies to see without a paddle the other day. It was fun. I'm actually taking school seriously this year which is a big change from last year! lol. I hope it stays this way. 

OMG there's SOO much stuff i wanna write in here but i can't. Too much shit. But i guess if you know me well enough, then you'll already know ;-)

I finally watched a little bit of Chicago today, i really wanna see the whole movie though. Anyone wanna watch it with me?

ok WOW i cannot believe there is ANOTHER hurricane coming. I am SOO scared, even though we do get friday off school. I hope it turns so we get a day of school and then nothing happens.

Well i gotta go...i'm on my way out.
Later,

Well i've not really been doing too much lately, just some stuff :-x 

I have to go out to dinner with my parents and lil bro today because my mom wants to try and sort out this 'hate' that me and my step-dad have with each other. It's not hate, he just yells at me for no reason so i yell at him back because he can't treat me like that, he's not my dad! Oh well at least it's food at Fridays :-)

Anywayz gotta go, i have to go to lunch soon...

"event","I've actually not been busy lately! Me and Marc haven't been hanging out much. I love having time to stay home and sleep after school. I know it won't be for long though. 

I wanna go to the mall again. But everyone's so busy with their school work and stuff that they don't have time to go. I'm bearly getting any homework this year, it's nice. I have a feeling that my Holocaust class is gonna start getting really hard though. I mean it's filled with juniors and seniors who are gonna be smarter than me.
I'm thinking about joining the wrestlerettes at school with Eden but i'm not sure, do you think i should? I'm trying to make Eden do it so she can get a parking decal and then drive to school, but then i'll have to do it with her. I just don't have the slightest clue on what the hell it is though? 

Tomorrow i have to run the mile for personal fitness, which i hate! I hate getting all sweaty at school. And that means i can't wear nice clothes. I need new sweatpants, which is another reason i should go to the mall. This one guy at the mall who works in Hot Topic told me he had a band and told me to go onto his myspace.com thing to look at pictures and stuff but i don't know how to look it up or whatever so if anyone knows, feel free to tell me! lol. 

Well i gotta go look after my little bro and make more money for the mall =)

"event","I've been thinking a lot about everything lately. Things need to change. Like everything.

Tonight i went to see The Exorcist at the movies with Jess. It was SOO scary! I couldn't handle how scary it was. I also went to BK and asked for a bacon cheeseburger, and the freaky guy asked me if i meant the junior cheeseburger with bacon on it and i'm like uhh YA! I swear i am never gonna get a job in one of those places. I had a very interesting phone call tonight. It might actually change things. I haven't decided yet. Dexter IMed me today and we had a very interesting conversation, lol. It was fun talking to him, he seems really cool.

Tomorrow i'm gonna go to the mall again to get a new necklace since my fav. one broke :-( and then probably hang out with Marc. I wanna get a job at the mall now, and then i could bum rides off Alex <33 lol. That would be fun. 

I wanna dye my hair. I'm not sure what color yet. What do you think? 

Yay my step-dad fixed my back door in my bathroom so now i can sneak people in my back door again =) lol. Not that i would 0=) hehe. But i can't right now since the rain was so heavy today my pool flooded and went into the back yard so there's like a stream going right past the entrance to the door :-\  it's actually kinda cool haha. 

Do you think that it's simply a part of nature that we always keep some form of attraction to our exes? That even though in our heads it's ended, the old flame still burns. I don't get it - surely if you break up with a person your feelings for them have ended. But then you still seem to think about them and wonder what if?

Well i'm tired and don't feel like sharing any more of my many thoughts lol.
Later days

I got more new clothes :-) they're soo cute. I'm thinking about saving up my money now so i can buy my Dooney and Burke purse that i want though. I really need a new purse and i'm soo addicted to Dooney and Burke. Only problem is i don't have $140 yet so i'm gonna need to do a lot of work so i can afford it.

Well guess what. The one person that i think is like the hottest guy ever is gonna ask me out...and i'm gonna say no! As much as i want to say yes, i can't.

Well i'm at Jessica's house so i'm gonna go for now,

I heard a lot of peoples power is out. Mine's not. We didn't even have to use any of our 3 generators. I don't know why we have 3? My step-dad is psycho about all these tool things or whatever they're called. He loves them. 

I wanna go to the mall. I really want new stuff to make myself feel better.

Thursday night was fun. I hung out with Jaimie, Brooke, Jessica M and S, Kevin, Cory, and jp at Jaimie's house. I've not hung out with with any of them in a long time, i hate that. I've been too busy lately. I love hanging out with you guyz :-)

Outside looks pretty. I wanna go look.

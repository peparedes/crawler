"event","(I think it was a sunday morning. I came home and watched as the light turned pink on the clouds and wept because we are alone in ourselves, incapable of ever completely expressing anything to anyone, though we might try to imitate our formless insides through art or music or the written word. still, these are just imprints of our minds, as incomplete as fossils preserved in stone, yet giving the comfortable illusion that because we can share, we can fill our lonely voids through our understanding of one another. but there is no me understanding you. there is only me understanding you through me, through my individual perceptions that filter all of my experiences into one, narrow sense of reality. reality is created and defined by thought. vision and reality interchange, like energy and matter. there are millions of personal realities that sit somewhat uncomfortably beside the larger, collective consciousness of the things that we, as humans, accept as shared truths. but what is truth, i wondered, sitting on my steps in the cool, indifferent morning, pondering at my tears, which flowed without my full experience of any kind of pain, just a complete awareness of BEING, alive and alone, part of this universe and this time and this world, existing along with all of these other creatures that are alive and alone, whether they see it or not and regardless of whom they might marry or make love to, or how many baths of the multitude they might take, they are just as alone as i am, maybe more so because of their inability to see it. 
and it occurred to me, much later--after some sleep--that i had discovered a truth about the world. we are alone. and as sad as that may initially seem, it made me very happy to realize it, and to accept it, simply because it is true. because if truth exists, then good and beauty must also exist, and we can discover those things too, if we choose to see them.)"

"event","Just five more minutes and then Thanksgiving will be over. What an anticlimatic holiday, six hours of preparation for a meal that takes my family about ten minutes to devour. And then everyone hurries away to escape the dishes. But home time is good and this year was free from any real familial dysfunction, although my dad did hide a camera in the corner of the dining room, and taped the entire meal without any of us knowing. I'll watch it tomorrow and probably be bored to death. I went and hung out a bit after dinner, saw a lot of people I haven't seen in months, and there will probably be more of that tomorrow. I like seeing old friends, I'm glad they're still friends. Turkey makes me sleepy. Happy Thanksgiving everyone."

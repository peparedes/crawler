"event","Today , I did nothing special, I went to the hospital to do my excersises for my backproblems, it went well,but now my back hurts a little , but tomorrow it will be fine! I hope, Fred and I gonna go searching for a tvkabinet, now our Cd's and Dvd's are exposed to our kids and Till the youngest one likes to grab them and I don't like him to play with my dvdcollection!So it's important we find a kabinet that has a closed section as well and is big enough to store them too!

So Hilde pretty please make them quick I want to put it in Helena's hair soon!They are so original and cute , no other kid in her class will have such cute hairclips!;-)

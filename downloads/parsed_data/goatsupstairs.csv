I'm starting to think about my future more and it's kind of scaring me. I have no idea what I'm going to do. But I feel like I'm almost ready to get a move on and grow up a little...!?

And not having a job for two months is just killing me. Coming back from vacation is even worse. I have NO motivation, and the thought of starting this whole job search all over again is making me very anxious. I can't wait for a hook-up like I have with all my other jobs. Waiting doesn't work! Well, I guess it actually does sometimes haha.

Anyway, I'm over the summer hotness. Definitely not helping with my laziness. Fall can come anytime it wants..."

I&nbsp;only need to take 9 credits for my last two semesters and so far&nbsp;I'll have Tuesday and Thursdays off next semester. I'll be able to work a lot more and save up money for travels! Also fairly excited to look at internships for Summer 2012. They will be a very good glimpse into the work I can do as an Anthropologist. I'm starting to feel a lot more optimistic about my future now. And one of my friends told me I&nbsp;definitely was an Anthropologist and this just made me really happy. I really love my major! <br /><br />In the meantime, I&nbsp;need to find more time for school. There are only 5 weeks or something left. I&nbsp;still have 5 papers left and finals, and lots of readings. I need to drop a shift at work and limit my nights of going out. I'm afraid I&nbsp;won't have a lot of money going into the summer...and if I&nbsp;stay at Corbett I'll only get paid once in June.&nbsp;Don't know what I'm going to do about that yet. I am so conflicted in getting a new job over the summer, just cause I'm worried about flexibility of trading/dropping shifts. Oh well, I'll deal with that when the time comes. <br /><br />Janie got back from Paris yesterday and I&nbsp;CANNOT&nbsp;wait to go. It is so beautiful. So rich in history. When I&nbsp;make it over to Europe definitely need to stay a few weeks. So much to see and do. Janie brought back some wonderful gifts, very generous. :)<br /><br />On top of everything else, BASEBALL is here!!!&nbsp;And we all know this makes Jenna a very happy person.</p>Time for homework...and some fancy scientific research!"

When I think about it, the only things that really get me down are school sometimes, when I feel overwhelmed. And playing with my hair.

This sounds so dumb but it really is to me a nasty nasty habit that I can't break and I get so sad sometimes about it.

if i lived closer to campus i would just get a bike, honestly. but i can't bike to home and campus so much for work and school, and i especially won't be able to once winter starts.

Second, I'm in a piss ass mood because my aunt has been around the last few days and I like her and all but it's annoying. She is sleeping in Janie's room and that means Janie gets my room.

I don't know if I should have a boyfriend because I become dependent on them pretty quickly. Should I be as bummed as I am that he hasn't talked to me in two days?

And I have a KILLER headache and I'm just feeling super pissed right now. I'm not meeting any of my expectations in life but for the life of me I don't have it in me to try.

"event","Wow...I looove Denver. I had such a blast at Quixote's last night. That place is fucking sick! There were three bands going at once and it was like a mini music festival haha. There was an outdoor patio where people were playing and it was like a mini Mishawaka or something haha. I enjoyed all the bands and all the people. There were many very entertaining people, which I probably noticed a lot more cause I was actually sober! If I weren't in college...I'd definitely move down there. So much going on...so much fun. And The Nu Classics...killed it! I love them :) Such a good summer so far! Still sooo much to do. And only 2 months to do it..."

"event","This summer might just officially be the greatest ever. Still got Soulive next week to look forward, Red Sox game, The Motet and Lotus at the Mish, California, Lady Gaga, Cubbies games and if I can volunteer for the Telluride Jazz Fest I can get into that free and possibly get free Phish tix as well...if not, some guy offered me free tix if I help set up tents before the show. And then after that is the Mile High Music Fest. That would be one solid week of craziness...

But other than that I still need to hike! And camp. And still get my bike fixed...oy.

On another note...Hodi's is turning whack on me. I think I might start limiting it to shows I definitely want to see and Monday nights. Ha. It just sucks because that was the place I always felt most comfortable and that is starting to not be so true. Not just because of the people who go there, but the people who work there are kinda crazy...

I'm having a lot of fun right now but I can't wait to get out of Fort Collins for a solid week. And then whenever I move or get out and travel. I NEED TO TRAVEL! New choicest destination is Thailand...ah!"

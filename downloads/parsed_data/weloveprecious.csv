"event","Honestly Wow it is surprzing how you can just forget to post on something for soso long.  I don't even remember when my last post was WOW.  So I'm not even sure where to start...  Maybe I should start with somewhere like last November since thats basically  a year ago... I'll try to remember everything from then on and see where it goes.  I remember it started with me ""dating"" Calvin.  That was just a disastor he was all ""I  Love You"" and I wasn't really into that whole we've been together for like a day and your telling me you love me thing.  I tried to blow it off.  He tried to get down my pants and I would allow such a thing considering I think he has like a million dirty diseases.  We Then broke up..  I went Home to work that minth and That night I had seen the Sock N Buskin Show One of the ones Where Rob lost his pants and Whitney didnt speak english.  I went back to the dressing room after the show and rob ""flashed"" me he was wear tighty whiteys and I laughed he then hugged me then baSically naked Shane and Charles also came up and had attacked me too so it was over all fun I would guess.  I went to the cast party that night I just remember everyone being crazy for a while and then when it got later we got serious and had a really serious talk about fears and things like that.  What came out that nighht was how Travis ahd broken my heart and how I knew one of the worst forms of rejection.  Finally being able to tell people the truth about travis's and I relationship what had happened and what caused our breakup which had been a question on evryones mind they were just afraid to ask.  I told them that after 18 months TRavis told me ""I care for you bt I dont think I could ever Love you"" they were of course shocked to hear that.  I hadn't told anyone that so It was emotional and I really for the first time cried about it all.  They were all there and supportive about it. After we had our long heartfilled conversations we ahd all gone to sleep.  I shared a blanket with Cory and he ended up  kissing me which was quite suprizing because well cory was 15 and I was 18 and it was intresting to say the least.  After that I went back to school and basically ust worked on school work and tehn I had finals and I passes all of them.  Then I went home for winter break and was working at acme.  On December 18th I didnt have a ride home from worlk TRavis had started talking to me again after my friends basically ambushed him to do so. He had offered to give me a ride home from work even though he was getting off two hours after I was finished because my parents had called and said find a ride home at last minute.  I actually walked around the store for a bit and a friend who also worked in acme but in teh deli offered to drive me home insted of travis because he was getting off of work sooner.  I said okay.  He drove me home and we walked up my drive way and he gave  me his phone number and had kissed me on my doorstep and left.  Later that nighyt he had sent me a messeg on Myspace(haha) and it was saying how he was shy and he has asked me to date him.  I saw hime the next day and said yes.  After that after Christmas I actually headed to Flordia to see my Best Friend because he had be unexspectedly moved down tehre in the process of his parents seperation.  The week ws the best week ever we celevrated New Years Together and just ahd fun be crazy and hanging out with one another.  That week ended quickly then break ended and I went back to school dating someone.  I remember switching a few clases at the begining of drop add and got a good schduale.  I started classes and The rest of January went pretty fast.  Then Febuary came  around celebrated Valentines with Anthony and he had given me a Very pretty necklace for it.  After that I went back to school and I went to my friends party where I had  3 cups of alcoholic beverages and then 4 cups of jungle juice right away (thanks katie who doesnt drink alcohol and decideds to play alcohol pong) and then my friend Mike who was also pretty drunk kissed me then katie kissed me then my ex Calvin kissed me rediculos I say.  I called Anthony the next day and he was perfectly okay with it which was very surprizing.  Then I came back home in march things were fine.  Got a root canel somewhere in this entire process it sucked cost me 1000 dollars.  Was Production Assistant for REd Vs. The Wolf Godd show cast very ahrd to work with.  I'd rather not relive that expeirence lets make it Simple Amber + Zane = All The work and we did awsoem at it.  We spent so many late nights at the diner YAY APD.  Then the show ended and Zane and I had Renn Faire and it was Fun I turned purple from sunburn (ouch) and I sold someone YAY.. I also ended up meeting Jordan (Anthony and I werent speaking Fighting almost broken up at this point) and He and I connected and that night well one thing lead to another.  I had finals and then went home Anthonyt and I broke up I had teh Balls to tell him what had happened With Jordan but he couldnt even tell me he had staretd dating someone while we were still together.  Jordan and I were complicated and Finally he just became and Asshole and we stoped talking.  Okay tehn the summer Jared moved back and I spent alot of time wioth him and Josh and alos Katie from back home.  Also Riverden I ahd an Awsome time with those guys and they're so amazing and I love them and tehre band.  Offical photographer I ahve become.  OKay SO then through Riverden I met JT.  He's awsome still is we were together for a while until he moved back to colorado.  Then One night Katie and I drank some Vanilla Stoli in her room after both having some rough times.  I really do miss JT Its sad that we would be together now if it wasnt for him living in Colorado *tear* Then I moved Bcak to school in mId July because of staff TRaining.. I am an RA or CA whatever you want to call and training went well.  Classes Started and they are going still going whatevre.  SO far this semester  I have kissed 4 people and I am definitly attracted to teh one and he seems to be attracted back and its awsoem just dont think somethings going to come from it.  I had a resprortory infection for about a month and then I got my Wisdom teeth out about two weeks ago they gave me Vicoden... Yea and tehn  I had to go home and go to my uncles funeral...  YEa thats everything for right now I guess"

"event","Well right now I am still in Kutztown.  I will be leaving tommorow for home oh horray home it has been so long.  I will hopefully get to see my friends once more and also my dad.  Oh how it has been so long since I have seen my dad over four months to be exact.  Also that means i get to see my baby brother.  Lets see what has been going on since I have come to kutztown.  In september I broke up with travis and started dating eric.  Eric and I broke up in Late october because of the fact of physical abuse.  I later strted dating Calvin we then decided to be friends because we both weren't really looking for a relationship.  At one point I had fallen for a guy who lived in my building but he then told me he had a girlfriend.  Well that happens sometimes.  Well I may start writing for a magazine and also be an editor for it which is super exciting.  In October I got cast in a show, it was a childrens show and I was Goldilocks.  The show ended this past weekend and our cast of 4 were very happy.  The show had no plot and our director well couldnt direct.  Anyway on Thursday I got my ears periced and its cool.  They are 18 gadge and they are the small hoops with tiny balls on them.  I still havn't figured out how to take them off when they can actually come off.  I will most likly ask mike since he has the saME rings.  Well I'm am going to head away and this is what I have to say for now."

Well I got my dress for the fall dance and it's prettyful and i love it...  Okay so I have  no idea absolutely what to dress up to be as for Halloween and it's so annoying.... Anyway HOPEFULLY I can get Travis to see Nightmare Before Christmas because well he has never seen .  The poor poor boy it's such an amazing movie.  Okay my stepmom my little brother and her whole family is going to Disney World on the 27th to I don't know when.  My dad isn't going but that should be intresting to hear about when thye get back.  My little sister has a crush and she wont admit it, it's very cute though because the boy she likes is named Travis and I was pokeing fun at her because of it .  I was like oh brit if you start dating him we'll be dating boys with the same name.  And she was liek ewwwwwwww I don't like him because they're 12 and refuse to admit they like boys. Oh and kid nap the sandy claws beat him with a stick...... This kid wants to beat up CJ and I told christina go to Gmble tell him whats going on so if the kid tries anything with Cj . Cj won't get the blame.  If this kid does do anything I will do everything in my power to make sure this kid is not back in school.  Wow being president of the non- violence club has its advantages... Well after that littloe rant I'm going to try another attempt t get to set building .

""What the hell"" he said outloud without thinking.  He walked in something was off missing in fact, he couldn't figure out what it was.  He thought that maybe one of his roomates Lucas or Gabe maybe came in to borrow some deoderant or hairgel.  Nope that wasn't it both of those right where he left them, on the shelf above his mirror.  He looked around trying to figure out what was out of place, then he saw it the lock box with the months rent was broken open and emptyed out.  ""Fuck"" Malikia shouted, he ran to the spot where the emergancy cash was hidden, it was gone too.  He was baffled, ""Where could the money have gone"" he thought outloud again.  Nothing else was disturbed in the apartment.  He knew it had to either been  Gabe or Lucas, but why?"

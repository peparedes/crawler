The Bivens is asking me ""what makes you hot"" (through my headphones unfortunately). and my hotness is now in the realm of GIS and data processing, so people are seeking my assistance in computer matters not personal. which i have been told is a good thing, even though today i had a brush with reality and people trying to snake my project and bully me into giving them data. They knew all along what i was doing, and did nothing to help. normally, being informed that you are the expert at the school is a scary compliment, but today it was a bit upsetting. oh yeah, sexy computer drama. :p 

Oye, the scary thing is that I'd rather work on this than do my school work. What makes me hot? GISing Madagasy Forest! I am such a tree hugging GEEK!!!!!"

"event","Ok, so the crew has been back from Madagascar for a few weeks, but I still haven't totally gotten my life together. It's like I had to hit the ground running and simultaneously developed severe enuui towards anything productive. Yes, I am still unpacking and organizing my room. Although I did survive the initial shock of society that had me screaming ""TAKE ME BACK TO THE FOREST!!!!!"" Now I have a short response paper due tomorrow and a write up on my summer adventures due Friday, then we have campout for the weekend and next weekend in the triathalon, then there is granddaddy's b-day with the fam and holy shit we're at Fall Break. And no, I haven't done anything with my data from the summer. It's a bit overwhelming, so I need to stop looking at the big picture, long term plan thing....bleh.

Anyway, life isn't a complete loss, even though I really do miss being outside 24/7 and acctually being able to see stars at night and not hear trucks drive past by bedroom. Yeah, life in Madagascar kicked my ass and gave me scars (literally, damnable rouy vines), but I truly enjoyed it. But this year will shape up nicely, I hope. I'm definatley doing more things outside of school and I have a work-study job, so that's less $$ I have to take out of student loans. Also, the roomie situation is much better. Heather was in Madagascar with me, and is much better than the brainless inconsiderate twit I lived with last year. Actually she's pretty cool and we're in some of the same classes and acctually like to do similar things. So, that is a definate plus compared to last year. 

Ok, I really really have to get started on this work.....ugh, I have spring fever in the Fall. Dude, what's up with that?"

I's had my shots, gotten my visa, and packed my bags (almost). I should be jumping out of my skin, but it really seems surreal, a foreign idea in the realm of possibility one might say. I'll freak out tomorrow when I'm checked as always by security and they open my carry-on to find that it is impossible to fit everything back in again unless you are Rubix (my father). Yeah, security people worry me, cuz you know, a blond chick waving to her parents is the perfect profile for a terrorist. But anyway, I am really excited. Hopefully I'll be able to send a few updates over the summer. If you want a postcard, send me your addy already!!! Lots of love my friends and I hope you have amazing summers!

Yes boys and girls, finals week is almost upon us. and it is the bastardly type of week (or longer) that is peeved that a student would even think of leaving this fine town that is Durham for a more exciting, nay more aetheticaly pleasing location. It doesn't even take consolation in the fact that yes, the students will come back and bring newbies with them. Instead it would rather screw you so hard that you remember where you came from all summer. Finals week is also great friends with Funding that doesn't come through, Traveler's red tape, and Housing issues. It's twin brother is Emotional crisis and such. 

So yeah. Life has been nuts. I needed a place to rant, and everyone around here has heard me already. So here you go."

Ack!! micromanagement drives me batty, especially when I have to study for a stats test today and the dog is currently sitting in my lap inpeding my studying and typing because it is storming. I think she is scared. Of the thunder, of my state of mine, of things to come??? i wish she could talk. Instead she strategically places her but under my arm as stares at me, projecting demands of a butt rub into my brain. 

But yeah, i have a stats test, it's on much more material than last time, and as it normally goes with exams of the mathematical persuasion, I need all the cram time possible. So, now the question is, how can I divert this mostlikely redundant meeting without looking like a slacker....."

Am i suffering from insomnia and pondering the meaning of my miniscule existance? no, again, that takes up too many brain cells. was i awakened by an attack of the munchies?  impossible, i would have to have been asleep for that one. Oh i know, did the dog wake me up needing to pee?  Considering she is snoring under my feet where she has held a faithful yet musically out of tune vigil, wrong again. Well, one might say, why the hell are you up so late? 

My answer:
Writing a paper on Geospatial Analysis for my conservation GIS class. Why didn't i do it last week? because i had three funding proposals do. Can i sleep in tomorrow? nope, have an ecosystem management paper and GIS homework due weds. and have to lead a discussion in EVSM on thurs. Then we have stats, and participation project, which by the way is the most insipid class ever. No i don't want to talk about my learnng goals, prof, we've talked about them so much at the expense of everything else that I wanted to learn that my learning goals decided to go on my much needed vacation. They hired temps, which are Mr. how to prevent oneself from stabbing ones eye out in frustration, Ms. how to not throw something at the chick who won't shut up so we can acctually leave class on time, and Mrs. why the hell can a prof be pissed that people were unable to show up for the voluntary class planned at the last minute for the friday before spring break?.

so, yeah.....i'd rant more, but my fingers hurt and i need about 1 more 1.5 spaced page on my paper. 1.5 spacing..who mandates that!!! Gah!!!!

it's been that kind of time period, i'm definately ready for the next era."

You can be calm, collected,<br>and fluent at times, but can change in an<br>instant into a raging ball of fury. Just like<br>ocean storms, you leave no survivors in your<br>path and you do not tolerate nonsense in dire<br>situations. You are most likely the<br>""peacemaker"" of your group of friends<br>and people can always count on you to hear<br>their side of the story. You enjoy time with<br>friends, just not ALL the time. You could<br>survive without friends, but you wouldn't be<br>able to last forever. You need company and so<br>if you were the Water Goddess then you would go<br>to the ocean, a river, or a lake and you would<br>spend time with the animals that live there.<br>Since you are a Water Goddess, you power is the<br>ability to breathe underwater, which gives you<br>the perfect hiding place from enemies.

"event","OK. So as a friend of mine who shall remain nameless has reminded me... It's been awhile since I've updated this thing. I should be. I've had a LOT going on recently too that needs to be put in here. OK. SO realistically speaking. Let's start with things that happened before when I last updated. SO, one of the guys at work got fired for stealing stuff. I couldn't believe he'd do that but whatever. I guess his choice to pretty much throw his entire life away because he wanted some games and stuff. I would NEVER do that. So what that he got a few hundred dollars worth of stuff for a while. Then he got ARRESTED. Yeah. Smooth move... So now that he no longer has a job at Best Buy working LP, I think I might be able to get his job here soon enough. I am hopeful anyways. And also I need it. Not only do I want it but... Yeah. On a part time pay-scale. It's kinda rough to get by sometimes... I dunno how some people do it... BUT. On to better things. So school sucks! Haha! I am currently NOT enrolled in any of my classes. My school kicked me out of them because I didn't pay my bill. So as soon as I found that out. I went and talked to my teacher and she said it's OK for now. She said just keep going to class like I would before, talk to some people about what to do to get a loan and then, once I get the money for school, she said she'll help me get back into my classes. Which is exactly what I need. So. That's good. :) And then I am really kinda behind on homework for the time being too. But I blame that kind of on my school... There is no real motivation to do it yet... I'm not getting in trouble so. Yeah. I dunno. BUT that's about how THOSE things are going. Then other than those things in my life keeping me busy... I'm really just trying to keep up with those. If I'm not at work, I'm at school or sleeping. I have been trying to hang with Michelle lately but it hasn't happened all that much. Well OK that's not all true. These last few days we've been able to more but mostly nah. Mostly we haven't hung all that much. And I've decided that I really like her. But I'm not getting my hopes too high on her liking me back and wanting to date me... For some reason I get the vibe that she doesn't want to date me even though she says she does. I dunno. SO I'm just gonna go with what I have in front of me from now on. I'm not gonna look into the past and/or future because that's just gonna mean trouble I think. Cuz if I look into her ex... Well there's a lot there I'm sure. And if I look into dating her soon. Well again. It's just gonna get complicated instead of being good. So. Why complicate it?! I'll cross bridges as they come to me. But on a lighter note... Her ex said he'd break my jaw if he ever saw me on the street. So that's neat. And I'm not really too worried about it. I'm not considering myself a badass by any means but... I guess just more of a badass than he is? Haha I dunno really. Oh well. Other than that... Friends are going good too. :) I am really glad I have the friends I do here in Bloomington. :) They are all good people and I enjoy them. I hope they enjoy hanging with me too cuz I dunno what I'd do without them. And well... Other than that... I got a fourth Snow Patrol CD and I am really digging it. :) It's good. I am currently way behind on homework for now SOOOO I'm afraid I must be going. I will update more soon. My new philosophy is like that of the old turtle in Kung Fu Panda.

Yup. New philosophy for life. I like it."

"event","I must start off saying that even though I worked for like 20,000 hrs straight today. It was overall a great day. I had a really good day. Truck went well at the end. I couldn't ask for more! And let me continue by saying I got to hang with my crush up at the front lanes for a couple hrs today. It was good. We then went to lunch at Quizno's. PS That place isn't half bad. I got full for 6 bucks and didn't even have to fight with them about mustard! I figure that's a win. :) I just realized this song is ballin'! It's In The Beginning by K'Naan. I'm impressed! :) And so I definitely need to go to hell for the way I'm handling talking to the crush. She is awesome. I'm interested. But my friend would still totally want to date her if he got a chance. He said it was OK for me to pursue her but doing that still feels like I'm stabbing him in the back. I am a horrible friend and I need to stop being such a horrible person. But for some reason I can't. I think I just want a relationship that bad. I won't let anything happen anytime soon though I know that. I know she JUST came from a relationship as a friend keeps reminding me BUT you also have to remember that I'm not a terrible guy. Maybe I'm just what she needs to get over a man that wasn't right for her. Even if I'm not right for her. I can still be interested and I can continue to care about helping. I guess that's not a good way to look at it either though because then I'm ""justifying"" it. I'm not trying to justify it by any means. I'm just writing down my thoughts and seeing if they make sense to anyone else. But yeah. SO other than that those 5 hr energy drinks work pretty well! It helped me get through the truck after working 12 hrs before that. :) I was pleased. I should have planned the timing better but it happens. Oh well. I need to pay rent tomorrow. I will do that and some other bills. Plus mail my Uncle's Christmas White Elephant gift... Yeah. I'm just a bit late. :S Not like that ever happens right?! :) Yeah. I am gonna then clean a little more before class I think. I also work tomorrow morning too so. Busy day again! I feel really behind on most things. I guess it's not so bad though! Busy means I'm usually making money and/or not wasting my life playing video games 24/7. So that's a bit of a win. I need to upload pictures to facebook. I might do that tomorrow if I get the chance. OMG Transformers 2 looks SO amazing! I want to see that SOOO bad. One of the only movies I'll go see in the theater I'd say. I'll waste money on that. OH BOY! I need to bring Transformers 1 to Dennis at the LP stand tomorrow. Duly noted. Mental check box filled! Ok. I need to read more Batman before I sleep. Yay for my new found enjoyment of comics! :) Good night world!"

"event","So first off let me start off saying I'm stupid and missed work this morning because I didn't look at my schedule and didn't think I worked so I went out drinking. Fail. Yeah. I know. Then when I was coming home at 6 AM I had to park across the street because my parking lot was too iced over. Fail two. :( Eh. So I still haven't heard from Zach and it makes me sad. I miss him. I wanna hear from him soon! But superbowl was OK today. I watched it at a friends house and had fun. :) I also got a girls number today. It was good. She was cute and fun and flirty and nice. So after I got her number I was pumped and felt good. Then when I added her on facebook... I found out she's engaged. Ouch. Sick burn. :( Oh well. She's still nice so I'm still gonna be friends fo sho :) And PLUS her last name is Cooper! Dude, that's PERFECT because one of my favorite video games of all time is Sly Cooper! :) Haha I told her about it. I think she judged me a little bit. :) Anyways. SO that was neat. The little thing with my friend and his crush liking me is still a slight issue. I dunno how to handle it so I'm just gonna take it easy and not do anything big. Just live life and see what happens. But I am interested in her. She's super awesome. Too bad I can't get a girl like that. And DESPITE what my friend says, I DON'T try too hard with getting girls. I'm not trying. I just want a girlfriend because I miss that feeling. I miss holding someone. I miss experiencing new things together. I miss the fun. I miss that part of it. I like being in a relationship. I know it's been like a month but still! I can want a new one if I so choose. I threw out a full gallon of milk today. Yep. Poured $2.50 down the drain. Fail three. That sucked. I still haven't cleaned my bathroom. Rest of the apartment is looking good but that is lacking. Fail four. I'm listing to Jack's Mannequin so that's good though. :) I am glad I have good friends here in Bloomington though. I miss my old friends but I'm glad I have good new ones too. :) I don't know if they like me that much but I enjoy their company :) I used hand lotion today. I like it. I don't like having dry cracked hands. So there's a few win's in there today too. I like wearing slippers and pajamas. I think some might call that girly but it's a comfortable feeling! :) You should try it sometime... For the first time today I felt good about myself in a long time. Even though I don't like the way my hair looks right now when I don't get time to fix it like I should. I don't like my cleft chin still but it's OK. I still felt good about myself. So that was good. It was a small victory but a victory nonetheless. :) And awesome fun fact for the day is that nonetheless is actually a word. I think we've covered this before but I still enjoy it. Now I think I'm gonna read a little bit of Batman Comic Books before I head to bed for the night. I think tomorrow is gonna be a looooooong day. :S Oh well. And then Tuesday I'm gonna have to go pay rent and bills too! Man. Busy week. Such is life. I want to be 21 really badly too. I hate that all my friends can go to bars and drink legally but I can't still. I hate that fact. It sucks. I do like how my friends don't always necessarily leave me to go drink at the bars though. So that's good too. :) Today was all in all a good day. I liked feeling good for a change. It was nice. :)"

I am super excited about it, because now this means I can catch up on his life and such now that he's in the Marine's! I bet it will be filled with excitement and wonder! Or at least I think it should :) I'll fill him in on my life too about how well I'm doing and such. I'm proud of it and I'm sure he'll love to hear about it. I think my life just got 10 times more complicated... My friend Jordan likes this girl named Michelle. Who I also think is a really pretty and interesting girl. And shit I just found out it's true. So now that I find out she likes me back. I can't go talk to her because Jordan is my friend! What do I do?! Fuck. I was trying to swear less. This isn't helping..."

I hate that things didn't work out between us. She was always good to me and like I said. I'm glad we're at least friends. If you ever read this. Please know that I've got your back always. Other than that again I'm working for Micheal S. tomorrow. I want to know how he still has a job either/and/or an apartment. I work so much... I want to know how he affords it. But. Not my place. I need hours so I'm not gonna argue with it. But may I say tomorrow is going to suck... That much I know. I still think about her too... I wish I didn't. Someday I'll forget it... Slowly the memories will fade. *Sigh* Never soon enough. I'd rather forget her if I can't have her. She deserves to be happy and as long as she is I would rather forget that I like her than to not be able to be with her. It snowed a shit ton finally. I've been waiting for this for years. I'm glad. But I've had to shovel twice in two different cities in one day. Not cool. Still love the snow though. I also love being in a college town because I get to see a bunch of 20 something year olds playing out in the snow like children. Makes me smile. But sadly... I miss you Uncle Jack. But please know that you will always be in one of my greatest memories of my entire life."

"event","First off. May I start off tonight saying this is gonna be a sulky post again. I keep thinking about her. Everyday... Secondly, also to state... I do enjoy Danny Glover... Ok. Back to my original theory. Everyday I go to class, work, hanging out with friends. Wishing for one thing, and that one thing is just a chance. A chance to prove that I can be better than most guys. To have an ACTUAL chance with you. I go through my days knowing you are hugging him. Kissing him. Making dinner for him. Watching movies with him. Watching him play video games while you hang out... If you would just give me one chance and liked what you saw. I promise that I'd be the one kissing and hugging you. Instead of making you cook, I have absolutely no problem cooking for you. I'll make whatever you want. I'll learn to make it if you want me to! I will even order it if I can't make it the way you like it. I know that you would like the one I made well enough but if you wanted it a certain way I would make sure you got it. I'd watch the movies you want. Even scary ones. I'd put up with that terrible feeling of being scared if you wanted me to. I would watch girlie movies too. Hell. I'd watch movies over and over if you wanted. I wouldn't leave the toilet seat up. I'd clean as much as you wanted. I'd put the video games down the minute you arrive to hang out with me. Hell. I'd give them up I suppose if thats what you wanted. All that for a chance. A chance to prove that I can do better than most. I might be mediocre at most things in my life but I swear I can be excellent if you want. I'm happy to be mediocre in my life really. I would gladly do what you want though. I can't say I'd change for you but I'd try. I don't want to change for you. But I do want to try and make you happy even at my expense a little. But yet alas you stay with him. For why shouldn't you?! You don't know how I feel and yet probably never will. Why? I'm not one to meddle. I would be a bad person if I honestly thought it was near OK for me to split someone up for my benefit. So I settle. Like the Death Cab For Cutie. The words go from my brain constantly but yet I don't say them. It's the sound of settling... Welcome to my entire life..."

"event","So things still suck with my love life. OR lack there of. BUT. My friend just told me that he wants to start a band. To which I replied of COURSE I'd try out for it. I can only sing. No instruments but it's OK he said. So that's awesome! I hope I get to sing in a band. That would be SO amazing! I would love it so much. Ugh. It's been one of my dreams for years! And I'd get to spend more time with them, *my friends*, and it would be fun! I'm in a better mood now I think because of it so. I dunno. I wish I could talk to her. Why can't I? Well that's a rhetorical question really. I know why... Why does life do this to me? I dunno. I guess I deserve it after all the bad things I've done. Hopefully someday a girl like her will be mine. Until then I guess here I am at 1 AM on my computer complaining to no one who reads this. But for now I'm gonna go hope and pray that a few things happen in my life to make it better. I don't know how or why they would but I suppose I could get lucky right? Ha! We'll see. Work went OK I guess for a 12 hour day... Got better at the end when I was around people I enjoy. And then when it ended so I guess I can't really complain too much. I am glad I have friends to get my low spirits up though. It really helps. Oh. And I eat way too much. I need to exercise... I think I might start a plan tomorrow. Look it up. Research it. Then stick to it. And also paint tomorrow. I need to really bad so. Fingers crossed."

"event","So. I was talking to a friend tonight who said that I should put all of my thoughts and feelings in a Diary. To which I replied... Ha. I don't know what I'd put in there. But then when I sat and thought about it. I had done it before and I should probably do it again. I get so bogged down and all of my thoughts and emotions get bottled up so much that it eats at me and tears at my insides while I work and go through each day... Then my immediate next thought was well shit what if someone I know reads this... Well realistically speaking... I have BARELY a handful of people that know this thing even exists... If one of them reads it. Then I guess cool. I'm not that worried. So now that I could get that out of the way. I just wanna say sorry in advance for this post. I don't know what it's going to contain but I'm just gonna type. I'm not gonna rephrase or edit anything. I'm just gonna put feelings and everything all in one. Just put it as I think of it and feel it. So I guess this is the new beginning for me and here goes.


Lately I like where my life is. I like being so independent and on my own. I just recently spent $150 on groceries and it was OK. I felt like a real man for once in my life. I feel proud of what I'm becoming instead of living at home and mooching off of my parents and/or other people in my life. I don't ever want to have to go back to doing that. I also like being able to work. I like working to make money. I just wish I didn't have to do it at Best Buy only. Don't get me wrong. I like almost all the people at Best Buy. I have made some surprisingly good friends from working there. More better friends from there than I had previously thought I ever would. But it's just not where I want to work forever. But there are good people that work there, sometimes it just takes a bit longer to be able to see that. I hate not being 21 yet. I know that when it really comes down to it, it doesn't matter that much but. It does suck because if I find a girl that is potentially interesting to me... More than likely the next thing I find out is that she is over 21 already. So it also sucks in that department because I can't go to the bars with friends or whatever if they decide to go for the night. Instead I am underage until April. Now granted that's not that far away but it is still long enough. I hate the way the economy is. It makes it so hard to do most basic things like before. I have recently discovered that I like a girl I work with. I cannot tell her this though as much as I want to. And I like her not just because of her looks. She is DEFINITELY easy on the peepers but, she is so smart. She's going to be going to Grad school soon. Hell. She has more schooling than I do and I'm about to graduate. So that's attractive about her. But not only her looks are attractive but she's so easy to talk to. I find that when I go to work I work in the department next to her. And I find myself disappointed everyday that I go in and she is not working also. When I think about working with her it makes me want to be spontaneous and just do something like draw arrows on the floor so that she follows them and then I have her favorite soda and chips sitting in the back so she can sit and talk for maybe 5 minutes. I of course don't have A. the courage to ever do such a thing B. the ability to do this. C. the will power to speak up and say anything to her more than small talk. And even if I could say anything of the sort to her. It would all be in vain. She has a boyfriend. Who I'm sure makes her happy. And she's taken. Even if she weren't happy. She's with him and that's more than I'll ever be able to say for me. I can't say all of these to her like I want to each and everyday I work with her. I know that her being taken by another man means she is off limits. And I don't speak of her as a piece of meat as in dibs but. I mean as a respectful human to her. I would never want to meddle in her stuff and mess a good thing up for her. Or anything up for her for that matter. So all I can do is sit and wonder what could have ever been or will ever be. I don't know. She could break up with her boyfriend tomorrow. But I can't say for sure I'd have the courage to actually say something to her about how I feel. I wish I could. I honestly do, deep down inside, I do. But I can't say that. And even if I did have the courage to say an inkling of these things I've put in here today. It wouldn't even matter. I am one of but many men on a LONG list that would kill any man to get to go on one date with her. OK I can't say they would do that but. There is a long list of men out there that would love to ask her out. And I realize that. What makes me more special than any one of them? Nothing. I have nothing that's amazing about me. I have lots of qualities that are probably more of a hindrance than a help. My looks aren't anything to write home about. My physique is lacking in more than one department. I'm not the strongest, fastest, best looking, smartest, or even close to them. I'm average. All across the board and I have been my entire life. Until her I thought that would be OK and bid well for me. I guess for once I could be wrong. I think this is just an unobtainable crush though. I am starting to think its more of a curse than a crush though. I find myself thinking about her more and more throughout my days. And speaking of my looks I hate that people are so judgmental. I would NEVER say anything of the sort to people, but some people at work have told me that my hair looks terrible. I personally like the way my hair looks. I have it combed forward like a punk rock look kind of. But people have not only commented on that aspect of it but on other things on it too. I can't believe someone would say that. I now realize how Shawn at work felt when I cracked a joke about his goatee. I will now apologize about that tomorrow if I see him. Sincerely I will. And I realize those people might have been joking about my hair but it still hurt. Just the same with his facial hair. I am glad that I have found friends from work that I not only connect with but get along really well with. I don't really know if they like putting up with me as much as I enjoy hanging out with them but I had fun this weekend. I enjoyed feeling like I belonged again. The same way I used to feel with my friends from my hometown. I hope things don't fall through with them and I somehow screw it up. I hope these are friends that will last a while. Don't get me wrong though. I am by no means replacing my old friends from home. It's just that I don't get to see them that often anymore and it makes it harder to stay close to them like I used to. SO. Instead of being lonely and self loathing... I figure I'll just go out and make new ones. I did that and I'm glad I found some keepers. And I hate to think of what they say behind my back but I guess as long as I don't hear it, it won't hurt. I know everyone talks about everyone else behind their back and I'm sure I've talked about my friends behind their back but. From here on out, I really am gonna try not to. Period. I hate it when it happens to me so I feel they should be treated with the same respect I wish to receive. I also have a friend that I hope to become better acquainted with soon. He has let himself slip into a rut he is not currently happy with. I know this because he has talked to me about it before. I recently went out on a limb and asked him if he minded if I helped him work out of that rut. He is currently known as the ""creepy"" kid. And I hate to see that because I know no one likes to be like that. No one wants to die alone either/and/or be alone for that matter. Everyone wants to find someone. I know he'd like to find someone who cared about him. Which is all any of us want... So I figure if I can help him get to what he wants. Then I will have been a pretty good person before I die. Whether it's tomorrow morning or 90 years from now. Either way I want to know that I've done good in at least someones life to the point that they would be different without that said event. So. I offered to hang out with him and help him work through the things that make him creepy. And I figure if we just hang and work on them little by little. Soon. He'll be a new guy. He'll still have the same fun attitude. But he won't offend others and/or himself anymore. Which is bettering himself as long as he doesn't like doing the offending like he is. I hope it works well for him. He's a good guy. He just needs to work on a few little things.


Ok. That post was entirely too long. I don't even know if anyone will read it ever but if they do. I don't know what to do to get through my days having feelings for someone that I can never tell. I don't know if this will work with my friend that I want to help. I don't know if I can ever be good enough to the people around me. I hope I can but I guess only time will tell."

It's kind of a sad time when the realization that you will never be as famous as you'd one day hoped for. Not really that fun. But enough about that. I need to update on my life currently.

I am still dating Sarah. That's good. I now live in Bloomington Indiana. I work at Best Buy instead of living at home and working at a welding shop. So. I go to school up here too instead of commuting. I have two roommates. Ugh. Don't get me started on that. I basically hang in my room without them. Yeah. So other than that. Just biding time for the moment. Living and enjoying it. I am currently looking for a second job. I want to work at a business with an IT position available. Like a hospital or local business. Eh. Hope that works out. So other than that I hope to update regularly. But, alas... Every time I say that on a blog of some sort... I end up not doing it. :( Oh well. I'll figure it out. I'll try and keep the one soul in the world who stumbles upon this updated.

"event","Apparently, there is this giant organization. I know, never saw one of those right? Ya well, they have them. And they are plotting against me in every way possible. For the fact that they would is enough but no! Oh no, they must then DO things to make life hard for me too. It is only because I got a new car. I have a 2006 Toyota Corolla. Most amazing car I've ever owned. Ok. So I've owned one before this. I had my older car for roughly two years, a 1990 Buick Regal Gran Sport. Yes. The mac daddy of all cars. It was a beaut. But, sadly, I had to get a new one because let's face it, that Regal wasn't fit for a rough, tough, blue-collar, avid woodsman-like, bull of man that I am. It was fit more for royalty. Like Princess Diana or something. So, I traded that beaut of a car in for this more hospitable one for my needs. I don't need something as fancy as that Regal, this Corolla suits me just fine. It was a real trooper too. Notice the was, I say that because it was MALICIOUSLY attacked within the last two weeks. They say bad things happen in 3's, well that's exactly what happened. I was driving to school Monday of last week or so and got a ticket for speeding. Strike number one against my ever-faithful and ever-loving Corolla. Then, Saturday evening, I was taken aback by the sheer number of people out to get me still. I mean, first the cops, with their strategic pick against MY car. Yet now, now the deer are out to get my precious, beloved, wonderful and yet charming car. I was harmlessly driving down the road, minding my own. Just chatting it up with my lover-ly girlfriend, Sarah. Who also did nothing to these deer that are at this VERY time plotting my downfall. So we are driving like civilized people, which I guess those deer hate that, but nonetheless we are driving and chatting and having a gay old time when SUDDENLY we are bombarded with a horde of deer 8 ft high and 10 ft thick bouncing around my car(ok ok, not quite that large but still...). I was lucky enough to avoid the ensuing damage, except one. Out of the two small bucks that attacked my car, I was unfortunate enough to hit one. Right on the front of my hood. It not only fucked up my grill, fender, hood, light, and quarter-panel. But it also hurt my ego. So, now that my car is completely and utterly ugly for what may prove to be a while, I am also sad to say that is not the end. As I mentioned above bad things seem to happen in 3's. So, Sarah and I finish out what we had planned, eating and chilling at her house. Then I am beckoned by my good friend Eric who requests my services as a 'woman charmer', which I am by the way. So I courteously oblige to his beckon, then proceed to be driving home at 2 a.m. Not the PEAK TIME for my reflexes I might add. I am driving, less than a mile away from my house when the third event of the demise of my car happens. So, not only do we have the Cops against my beloved Corolla, and not only also the entire species of deer against me, oh no! I must then also have a smaller critter to deal with, a Raccoon. Oh but one wouldn't be enough of a challenge for my tough Corolla which is still running after hitting a 6 point buck, no. One would simply make too much sense. They had to up the ante to TWO raccoons. And if they were at different intervals, then that would also make it easy and we still can't have that so, as you might have guessed. I then proceeded to run over TWO, I repeat, TWO raccoons simultaneously at 2 a.m. while trying to end my crap infested event of a day that I called my evening. So I then proceeded to viciously RUN them over with two sickening thuds that finally ended my evening of a downfall that I called my Saturday. I hope that I never have to go through that experience again because if I do, I don't think that my beloved car will be able to handle it. I mean it is tough and rough like I am but, damn. That's a lot of factors fighting to bring it down. I'm just glad it's still standing today."

No No No... Let me tell you. These are nifty. They are like talk show with GOOD TOPICS! I know I know, it's REALLY hard to believe, that talk shows can have good topics but, this isn't just your normal political arguments, religious explanations, or dating problems explained by Dr. Laura. Oh no. These bad boys are from techies online that want to share their views about most things tech. It's so cool. I like listening to their opinions because they aren't some BS doctor that think they know about peoples feelings. No. Ya. I know. It's nifty. Other than that speeding tickets suck. I got one on the way to school the other day. Oh well. Right now my philosophy is life could be worse. Ya know it's just money. It could be worse. I could be dead or something. As a wise woman once said, ""Life could always be worse."" It's so true. It's just money, or time wasted in some instances, so... I'll live. Life will go on."

I like the feel of this place a lot. I need a place to chill usually between my second class and my last class so I think I just found a great one. I am enjoying this a lot. I can sit here and do most things. I can surf the web, do homework, drink coffee, or just sit and relax in a comfy chair. It rocks. And I can watch traffic cruise on by if I want. w00t! And the people here are really nice too! I mean, this is the first time I've drank here so I asked what I should get to ease into this coffee scene and the girl behind the counter was very nice about it. And I got a small so as not to be RUSHED into it but, ya know... It worked good. It's good, the place is good. I like this. w00t again! k thx bye!"

Because when I got to my first class today, I only had a slight PART of my assignment done and so I was going to work on it in class. Well once class time rolled around, guess what came into play again? Yup, that sure is correct, constitutional day! I don't know what I did this weekend that was right but apparently SOMETHING was done correctly because God loves me. I bet it was when I actually got up and weedeated around the house the other day for my parents. Something did it though because God was nice enough to make my class get canceled. He's the man! Well, you know, figuratively speaking of course. Now if only there were someway for him to get me some money, then I'd never ask for anything again. Other than that life's been good so far so, gotta work on getting to class soon. K thx bye!"

We are trying to share some files across it and it's being gay. Ya that's right, its a gay jew now. And you know what else? I don't like ''teh internet'' And as soon as I say that, it starts working again. Ok. I'm just going to bad-talk the world until I get my way. I like that theory now that I think about it.

I actually got on here now to praise the internet and all its glory but then it started being gay and I lost that motivation but now I got it back. I just want to say thank you ''teh internet'' for being great and letting me have my own place to hang. I mean www.mitchellbumgarner.com is the bomb digaddy yo! Go there. And if you haven't yet you will be beaten down and flogged repeatedly. Or, not a single thing will really happen to you but I might cry tonight when I try to go to sleep and we wouldn't want that so. :( Please do it, for the starving children in Japan. (I know, I know, now I'm bringing in those damn Japs eh?)(:O CANADIANS TOO!)

I need sleep. I think I'm delusional. Oh well. Crap happens then someone dies and you get blamed, end up going to court for it, turns out you missed a few years on your taxes and now ''teh government'' hates you so you end up going to jail, then you are bubba's bf. And all of that is because of those darn Mexicans crossing the border... We really need that fence we been talking about building..."

"event","What kind of a holiday is labor day? Who wants to work more than what they have to, and WHO the hell wants wants more work on a HOLIDAY! :S Ya so. I think it should be called NO-Labor day. So that way it makes more sense. Because its like christmas, it's about CHRIST. And Easter, ok that one is random and I don't know wtf that is, cuz it's supposed to be about christ's death but uh, that'd be kind of a morbid day so we decided to pep it up a bit and put bunnies hiding eggs and vast colors galore. Ya, don't ask me, I don't make the holidays, I just follow along with them.

P.S. I finally got www.mitchellbumgarner.com up and running. I'll be doing some modifications for it right now like making a photography page but, if you like it you can email me about it. It's like a professional page and everything, it has a link at the bottom to email me and about me and site map and so forth... I thought it was nifty. And to get EVERYTHING done it was only about 20 bucks. Man, who says money can't buy you happyness. Cuz I'm pretty sure it can at this time. I mean I had to BUY the domain name and it's making me happy so. Therefore, vicariously, money can buy happyness. For some anyway."

My thoughts for today, whether or not to make a site, www.mitchellbumgarner.com. I mean I REALLY want to, but I dunno who would visit it. I know that no one knows of me so. And also no one cares about my life and about me. I mean sure a few people like laughing at me or something but for the most part, I'm just an average Joe. No one cares for my stuff. So. I'm at a delima. I need to decide but I can't quite yet. Maybe I'll wait until I travel and can post good pictures up and such and then it'll be more attractive and presentable. I will decide later I guess. For now I'm going to go try to work on my Main Page. If ANYONE knows how to make a picture have like addons and make parts of it jump out and then the jump out parts be links... Don't be shy. Thanks."

"event","To all those who have loving and caring siblings like I have, keep on keepin on! I love my sister. No matter how much we argue and fight and no matter how much of a butthead she may be, she's still my sis and I love her. And she's nice from time to time and makes my day better. This morning after I woke up, she had made pancakes! She shared them with me. She's the best, well sometimes.

Anyways, I hate it when people use Limewire, or any other P2P program to search for programs to obtain illegally, then get a virus, and complain about it. THAT'S A RISK INVOLVED PEOPLE! :S And also, don't download the SMALLEST/FASTEST one... Because that's MOST likely a virus. If you don't know how to do this stuff, to deal with viruses once you get them this way. Oh well. I suppose that's what business I'll be going into, the ''people are retarded and don't know how NOT to get themselves in trouble on a computer'' business. A.K.A. I'll be fixing peoples computers A LOT.

Other than that, I think I'm going golfing tomorrow. Yes, I believe I'm going to go with my father and my distant twice removed not really family but is family somehow down the line cousin/uncle/relative. Mr. Jim. I know his last name, just couldn't spell it right now so. It's gonna be Mr. Jim.

I love my laptop right now. I want to travel with it though. I want to NOT be stuck in my house all the time and never get to go anywhere. I want to be able to just take my things, drive to Chicago (about a 4hr drive) and stay in a hotel, take pictures of the city, go sightseeing, and then just spend time there. Away from home basically, because right now it's hella-boring here. And I just want to relax and not have to worry about things. Which always seems to be the case when I'm home. Someday though, someday I'm going to travel and it's going to be the best. I can't wait.

Well to be completely honest I can wait because I have no money for the hardcore traveling I want to do right now. Oh well. For today I'm going to sit around the house and play Counter-Strike and relax. I'll write back at the end of the day probably, to update all of the people who read this, ok so it's just me, about how my day was.

"event","Ya. So, as my second post of the day, I say that today went really well so far. It's gonna be boring at first but get better and better as we go because I have some interesting thoughts.

First, Sarah and I hung out tonight. Sarah is my girlfriend. She's the bomb digaddy yo. She r0x0rs my s0x0rs. Ya I have always wanted to use that gay saying in some random paragraph and never had the Kahunahs to do it in school so there it is. For the world to see. Second she met some more of my family tonight and WOW do I now realize how weird they are. I mean its hella-better than the OTHER side of my family but that side is weird in its own way. Oh well.

My thought for today though caught my eye and I figured you should all know. I love how we as human beings name things SO literally. I'll give you a few examples to start off then I expect the rest of ''teh internet world'' to join in and help pitch in a few. Examples I found: Hamburger Helper... (it makes hamburger not so blah), Hairbrush, also with Toothbrush and ya.. You get that idea, windshield [on a car]... (it does just that, blocks the wind from our faces, along with bugs but it would be weird to call it a windbugshield so.... Windshield makes sense), Underwear (we do just that), headrest [in a car], Lawn mower.

There are more but, I can't take them all from you and its late so it's tough to think right now. I'm going to go play some Counter-Strike and be back tomorrow. I hope I gain some popularity overnight and actually have people read this. If not, won't be the first time that I have absolutely no internet fans. 

K thx bye!"

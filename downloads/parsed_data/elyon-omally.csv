I don't want to be alone in a place I don't know.  And you just saved my life, I don't think you're going to try and rape and kill me in my sleep."""

I looked at Neville, giving him a good once over,  slowly moving my eyes from the top of his head to the tips of his toes.

He hadn't, and maybe I was over stepping my bounds, but I didn't know these people, so what the heck.  ""I would think that he'd still have all that stuff that made him who he was, but that he was going to have a lot more stuff to go through.

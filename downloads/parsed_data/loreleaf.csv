"event","The story of the Jolly Rancher...  So there I was riding along in Miss Hazel's backpack.  I was tired of being neglected, I wanted it be in Hazels mouth too!  I have heard the stories of other objects and body parts and I was secretly jelous.  What did all these other object possess that I did not.  Surely I was the best tasting.  I just wanted to cream my yummy goo also!  I finally saw my chance, she was a tall sexy looking thing.  I knew that if I exploded on her, Hazel would be sure to notice me.  I snuck up to the pen, slipped out of my wrapper, and...  ahhh it was soo good!"

"event","Today for my Birthday, a friend brought me out Horseback Riding today.  The drive went quicker than I thought it would be, even though that this was out past Elkhart in BFE, WI. :)

Of course in keeping with my luck, I got a horse named Satan.  Actually his name was Mr. Hayney.  It may have well been Satan.  Now realize that EVERYTIME I ride, I get that type of horse, today was no different.  We start by mounting and I was told my horse like to take the lead, and he walks up to the gate himself, then proceeds out (the only horse to leave the corral).  Now I have not ridden for a while, but he was on auto-pilot.  If I pulled back on the reins, he did back-up, however that just seemed to get him pissed.  He wanted to eat grass, and eat he did.  Anyway we finally get out and he is better and actually letting me use the reins (I think he was faking it).  I was told he is almost always 1st and does NOT like any other horse by him or trying to pass him.  Needless to say right before we were about to trot and open them up some, one of the guides was remounting and her horse came near Mr. Hayney.  Well....  you would have thought that someone pissed in his grass he ate earlier, as he kicked the guide in the ankle while aiming for the other horse.  The trainer went down fast, when she finally got her shoe off, you can see the ankle was totally black and blue, streaked with red where the blood vessels had broke.  I would not be suprised if her ankle was broken, as I'm sure she had to go to the ER.  :(

I never knew a ride would turn into a bloodsport.  Either way the ride was fun and exciting, even the drama part, however I hope the guide/trainer is ok.

On the way back from the stable, I totally missed my turn off, as I was involved in deep conversation.  When I say I missed it, I mean by like 15 or so miles!  So we ended up just going to Milwaukee.  We parked by one of the parks, and walked through the park while trying to decide where to go and what to do.  There was this tree... it was there... so it had to be climbed...  Climb it I did, so did my friend, well this branch jumped up and hit her square in the nose.  Actually she was not paying attention and just jamed her face into it.  It was funny for a second until I realize that she actually whacked herself pretty good.  Some yummy food and tasty adult beverages at Rock Bottom (along with a dose of Aleve) seemed to do the trick.

All in all, a very, very good day to celebrate my Birthday!  I had a ton of fun!

Until next time..."

"event","It's not always that I am introspective howver the past few days have again enlightened me to another level.  I have been thinking about life, love, relationships, and how we all react to things in life in general.

I get frustrated easily when things do not fall into my concept of what is ideal or perfect.  For example, when it is busy at work and things are piling up, I tend to get very annoyed at the situation and the people within the situation.  I have always been like that, and I think I will always be.  I want things to get done, and I get upset when they are not.  I lose faith in people when they break their commitment or promises they have made.  Everyone makes ""mistakes"", however how we recover from them shows our true character.

Yesterday while I was the MC for an event, I had so many responsibilities, and I was all consumed.  Back at my house I was asked to present one last thing when the tables were turned and *I* was presented with a Navy Shadow Box.  For thoes of you that don't know what a Shadow Box is, it is a deep picture frame with small shelves built into it, that is protected by glass that hold and displays collectibles or keepsakes.  I was presented one that had all my held ranks in the Navy, all of my awards, along with a plaque noting my duty stations.  Above it also encased was the National Ensign that was flown over Camp Lejeune, NC just for me.  The accompanying certificate read ""This is to certify that this National Ensign was proudly flown at John A. Lejeune Hall, Headquarters, Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, in honor of your faithful service on 19 July 2005.""  It was signed by the Commanding General of the base.  My friends thought so much of me that while this celebration was not for me, they honored me at it.  I was very deeply touched and moved.

This got me to thinking about my current life in general.  I hope that I have been a faithful friend and servent to all my friends.  I am very happy in my current life situation and I wanted everyone who reads this to know it.  Basically the past 5 weeks have been some of the very best I have EVER experienced.  It is a wonderful feeling knowing you are loved and that you have enriched the life of another.

Well enough deep thoughts, I am getting ready to go hang out tonight, so I have to make a call and hit the road.  TTYL!

8/22 - is the date one of you wanted to know!"

"event","Wow it has been a busy and amazing weekend!  

Lets start with Fri.  Work went well, we were very busy and I would have gone down fast if it was not for the help of Hazel.  She always seems to know what to do, to help me out just at the right moment.  While she is new, she catches on fast and knows what needs to be done almost all the time.  She can't tape or read numbers very well, but thats ok ;)

Sat.  As I sit here I am flooded with memories of one of the best days I have ever had.  I smile just thinking about it.  Just wow.

Sun.  Went down to Bartlett, IL to take place in the annual 4th of July parade.  As always it was fun trooping with my MWG brothers and sisters again.  The parade went well, it was not as hot as last year, which was good for Trent as he was DV.  He still looked like I did last year :)  The BBQ was fun, and good time was had by all.  Aimee while playing scout trooper, got to ride this pretty nice scooter, which she dumped 3 times.  It's too bad no one got pics of that!  When I told the group I capured them on my camera phone, she was pretty embarrassed (I really wish I would have done it, but the batt was very low and was blinking).  Then she proceeded to dump me on my back *TWICE* while I was sitting in my chair.  If you know me, that calls for war.  So when she least expected it...  Then she walked away for a sec, not only did we hide her chair, I took her smokes and hid them, and opened and started drinking her soda she had just grabbed.  Thinking she would blame me for her smokes, I passed them off to Trent.  Good thing as she went right for me.  They were again passed off to Andrew, where at that point the lighter was removed and passed off to someone else. :)  That is always the best part of doing events, the hanging out afterwards with everyone.  The city would not allow us beer or other tasty adult beverages in our tent, but thats ok because we had just as much fun!

<A href=""http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/dalekhunter/album?.dir=/2319&.src=ph""target=""_blank"">Click here for pics!</A>  Select Slideshow!

Gina - I got your text, but have been wrapped up around some things.  How can I help?  If you send me your HD, I can try to get the data off and get it reformatted for ya!

I am truly lucky to have such a different and diverse circle of friends.  I just read that Wizard World is coming up, along with Flashback, and Dragon Con.  There are only like 2 or 3 MWG going to DC this year, and the reason I go is to hang with my buds.  I want to go but am having second thoughts.  I have to firm up wtf I am doing so as not to leave others hanging (Bobby, Mike, etc...)  The con season is about to be full swing again.  BTW Bobby are you going to Gen Con this year?  If so I have a favor to ask of you.  Ah Gen Con - why did they move it?  I liked it in Milwaukee, so easy to get too.

Well now for my e-friends on WoW (I miss you guys).  As soon as I am done posting this journal, I am going to post there to tell them where I have been and what I am doing.  So if any of you guys are reading this, make a live journal account and post here!  (Yes you have to tell me your screen names you fvcktards).

Vegas baby!  Speaking of WoW, that reminds me of EQ and HoS and the infamous Vegas trip.  I can't find the pics anymore, so if any of you have them I would like a copy.  Yes Karen, I do have the Bush Gardens pics as well.  Also speaking of Vegas - when are we all going?!?!

I am finding that the more I actually get out and develop relationships, the better and enriched my life has become.  I said it before and I'll say it again, I am truly lucky to have such good friends.

Well I have a ton of stuff to do around the house from laundry, cleaning, burning CDs/DVDs, etc...

Later!"

"event","What a great week this has been so far.  A minor hiccup on Sun am ruined some plans, but other than that, everything has turned out well.

So yesterday was hot as hell here.  We were out of Q-Tips and Rubbing Alchol, so I asked Adam, if I could zip out to the Wallgreens and get some.  So on my way out of the door at the good ole' Racine BBY, I get blasted in the face with a wave of hot air, that kind of hot air that just blows you away.  By the time I get to my car, I notice a bead of sweat forming on my head!  I open the car door and the wave of internal heat almost knocked me over.  It was a bit overcast, and it led to me thinking about my tan, or lack there of.  I have a lot of sessions left at my local Fake and Bake, so today I will go and sleep for 30 min. :) 

I had a fun and interesting conversation with a friend last night for 3.5 hours.  What can you possibly talk to someone for over 3 hours about?  I'm not really sure, but we did.  Actually it was one of thoes conversations that just flowed naturally, like when your on a roll.  If you all did not know Cirque du' Soleil will be in Minneapolis later this year.  I have never seen the show Corteo.  I have been fortunate enough to have experienced almost all of the others live.  If you have ever been you know what I mean.

http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/corteo/intro/intro.htm

I saw that Gina is back on cast again - thats cool!  I can't wait to go this year, I hope I will have a few weekends off to be able too.  If not, I will just have to request time off!

I found making a 80's mix CD is harder than I thought it would be, there are so many good tunes out there, and I wanted only 1 from each artist/band, so the decision must be made as to what to include that defines the band during the time.  Additionially finally settled on the types of music, and decided it would be more of a party/driving CD.

Well it's 12:30 and I have done nothing today on my day off, so time to go shower, throw a load of laundry in, and hit the road!

My LJ question of the week:  How did you come up with your LJ name?"

"event","Today was a busy day in the morning then slowed down at work towards the end.  Nothing major, it was just Haz and I until Phil came in.  Well I guess Mark was there too, he told me that he was told that he is not to actually ""work"" on the bench.  The only problem with that is when the schedule is done, he is figured in our active labor, so when they schedual one tech and himself, the tech is slammed and caught running between the customers at the bench, testing out gear for CS, answering the phone, working on machines, and helping others.  Not that it can't be done, just gets a tad wild at times.  But that's ok, I like wild!

Anyway, I got to hang out yesterday with a new friend, and it went well!  I got my ass kicked in Mini-Golf (revenge shall be mine), and we ended up talking about OMG everything.  The topics jumped so fast, lets see we covered:  Career paths, schooling, life (as we know it), family, work, clothes/fashion, gaming, computers, money, cars, feet, eyes, smiles, dating, sex, wishing wells, ren-faire, COS play, LARP, goals, the Zoo, theater, Vegas, alcohol, other assorted things, and music.

Then came attack of the killer mosquitoes.  They swarmed, people were running wild for their cars, like zombies were chasing them.  It was quite a sight.

Music.  As most of you know, I know my 80s music pretty damm well, but alas again, I was getting my ass kicked last night trying to guess name of song/band.  That was until I played the MP3s again today in my computer and learned that a good chunk of them were miss named and titled.  I will correct that and return an updated kick ass 80s CD.

It was simply amazing, and a tad scary how much we actually have in common!  I mean that in a good way...

BTW I also leaned last night that I can get drunk off of 3 bottles of water! (Long story)

Oh yea Breasts...  Now don't get me wrong I'm all for them on women, but DAMN if they are not in the way sometimes! ;)

City nights
Summer breezes makes you feel all right
Neon-lights
Shining brightly make your brain ignite
See the girls with the dresses so tight
Give you love, if the price is right
Black or white
In the streets there's no wrong and no right

Outta site
Buy your kicks from the man in the white
Feels all right
Powder pleasure in your nose tonight
See the men paint their faces and cry
Like some girl, it makes you wonder why
City life
Sure is cool, but it cuts like a knife
It's your life"

Went to see Brad, Janet, and the Doctor the other night, it was a blast as always.  If you have never seen ""The Show"" at a Midnight Screening or live, you are missing out.

I have been collecting a ton of Hentai/Anime as of late, and actually have the start of a good collection.  I have also become friends with someone that also shares that interest, so thats good on a couple of levels ;)

Had a couple of people disappoint me when they promised they were going to do some things that they failed to do.  I'm trying to blow it off, but it was important.  Why can't people just keep their word?

While I know Gina is fighting to be part of Faire this year (and I hope she gets to do what she loves), I have gotten myself ready!

I like to see and tackle a problem from all sides, but time and time again I forget the age old truth:  When men ask for advice from another guy, they want someone to give them a solution to what they see as the problem.  This answer may come very quickly and be buried in context so you have to listen intently and grasp the suggestion when it is delivered.  Women on the other hand, I have found, tend to be looking for more of someone to listen to them about their situation, and offer reflective feedback.

Somehow I keep forgetting this, and I don't know why.  Perhaps I get too wrapped up in external distracters, self importance, or a general feeling that I can solve the worlds problems.  I need to remember this truth and work on this.

"event","So here I am at home last night at 1 something am and I look over at my phone and the little red light is flashing, beckoning me to pick up my phone and listen to my message.  So I do...

It's Garrett from work telling me how this client of mine came back to the store bitching about how he was able to to get his computer looked at by another repair tech at another company and how he was able to get it going for him.  First off he brings this POS computer with Win 95 in about 3 weeks ago.  I spent 30 min doing a FREE diagnosis.  After 30 min I found so many physical things wrong with the computer, to include bad ram, hd, cd drive, etc...  The computer would not post or boot.  I eventually said that I would have to take it in and charge the diag fee of $59.00 to give it a full run down.  He didn't want to do that, and asked what I initially thought.  So being the nice guy I am, I told him I thought his motherboard or processor may be shot.

He needs a new computer after all, so I direct him to the sales floor.  They move him into a moderate Gateway, and we do the set-up for him.  Because he buys a new puter and we are slow, I go ahead and do train him on how to use it (normally we send someone to their house and charge them $135.00).  This sucks up another hour of my time.  Over the next week I become his personal tech bitch over the phone telling him how to install the most basic of items to include RAM, print drivers, etc...  Eventually I cut the cord and tell him that he has to bring in his machine or call our tech support number for more assistance.

He has the balls to show up last night and tell my mgr that I misdiagnosed his old machine and how I tricked him into buying a new one.  After that my co-worker leaves me a message that manager he told this bs too said that he will ""Take care of me.""  I swear if that guy EVER calls or stops in the store, I hope he has the common sense NOT to ask me any questions, because either he will leave pissed off, or I will get fired for what I will have to say to him."

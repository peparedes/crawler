"event","yo!! man i am like so sorry that i haven't writtin in here!!! i have been busy with my boo. Me and him r geting closer than ever!!!! the bad thing is that i am getting  in alot of trouble latley.

On this past saturday i went to wonderland with my home boy denny. We had the best time...and of corse miles was working ....and i got to see him..... i saw him on his break and after work....

me and denny and miles took the bus to sqaure 1....and denny took the 34 home.....and me and miles took the 9..

i didn't want the night to end!!!...me and miles avoided my mother @  all cost!!!..she was picking us up in town so we went along the back roads!..

me and him were so into each other that day.....but then again we always are.  WE diecided to go and chil @ his house since his parents WEREN""T EVEN HOME!!!!...so we started to walk to his house...then my mother called my cell.

I told her that we were on the 44 and were going to be late...she belived me!!!..shit she is so stupid somthimes.....but anyways...we walked about half way when my mom called again!...she was like i am picking you up infront of his house!!!!...we freaked...

so me and him did the only thing two fucked up kids would do......we played like 007!!! we would sneak threw the bushes and peak around corners and run if we thought we saw her!!..it was so much fun and it was aroiund like uhhhhh 1am sunday morning!!!!...then we finally got to his house!!!

hehehehehehe we had fooled my mother!!! and it felt good in a twisted way....but hey i am just a twisted little girl!. anwyas my and him chillied outside for he rest of the night...we stayed up!!! we didn't go to bed @ all.......but we did lay on his dads hamick and stared at the stars....

I felt at peace with him.....i thougt and i bet so did u that me and him would ummmmmmm.....knock boots!! but nope...me and him don't need that right now in our realtionship.......I  told him alot of my secrets that i haven't even told my closet friends......i cried when i relived those moments and he comforted me........then we sort of dozed off in eahc others arms but me being the little girl i am i kept on tlalking...

before i knew it .....it was 6am...and we went for a walk...man oh man....i felt so good.....but i did feel bad abvout my mother...then when we got back to his house...we drank some baley's...damn that drink is sooooooooo good...

the one thjing that he learned about me that i hoped he never would have was.....i don't eat alot..i have been like this for awhile.....and i can't stop....i can go days without food....i feeel that i am fat and i need to lose weight......man when i told him this he was like you r not going to go anirecksick on me!!! HELL NO!!!..

man i felt lie someone actually cares...and i liked that feeling.......I have alot of problems that i keep bottled up..and that an't good.....


oh well....but me staying with him that night gave me a look into what it would be like to live with him ( if we satyedtogether for that long ) and i liked it!!!.......he is comming over ot my house on saturday and we might go see ORIGNIAL SIN on sunday ....but i don't know yet ...he wants to.....we'll have to see

We took the bus in the morning and man that was a weid bus. It was one of those long ones .....you know the ones that have that strechy thingy in it????...yea welll anyways....man i had so much fun that day. We went on like all the rides!!!......we didn't have alot of $$$....so we had to have fries for dinner!!!...but hey it was still fun.

We walked around alot...and talked..........he told me that he loves me sooooooooo much....when he said this i was scared @ first but then i understood what he means. I love him more then ever now... he is the only perosn that i can open up to about anything....he doesn't judge me or say that what i think is stupid...

I told him i love him more then he could know.......and i know what people will think when they see this....""how can we be in love we have only been going out for like 7  weeks"" but you have to understand that its like we have know each other our whole lives...we have alot of things in common and like i said before like a thousand times....he makes me happy.. I am not saying that he is the guy i am going to marry......but i feel that me and him will be dating for awhile.

anyways...then we got back into streetsville @ like around 1am. I didn't want to go home yet..so we walked around and talked and talked........we sat in a park near my dads house and chilled....we stared @ the stars and well....it was like the perfect moment that i have had in a long time. He kissed me and told me how much i meant to him......man i can't believe that i have him in my life ..........he treats me with nothin but respect...he has never mad me feel stupid or worthless unlike my other boyfriends in the past.

well i hate to go on here rambling on ...and on......so i will just say that...i am in love with my boyfriend!!! and i am not ashamd to say so!!!!"

Nothin can help me now...as i wallow in fear.
I try to mend the harm that i casued,  over reacting , with out thinking.
I feel like killing myself for acting like this about a silly joke.

Now i have lost the only person that could understand me,
the only person that would listen to me.
I sit in darkness now wish for one more chance,
a chance to be with him again, to forgive and forget.

HE was my boo...and with out him...i don't know what i will do.
I cry for a friend that wish was here....to understand all the pain i show with my tears.
no matter what i do...he won't understand.....how much he means to me,
with out him i can't be free.

Locked in a world of of messary and pain, all becasue i could take a joke.."

"event","How many times have you been pushed around? Was anybody there? Does anybody care? How many time have your friends let you down? Was anybody there? Did anybody stare? 

this is something i heard when i was listening the radio to when Miles was over yesterday......these words are so true.... This song is called life by our lady peace.....and I believe that this is so true...... for people that are unique they are offten judge, and pushed around.............and when they go to turn to someone....more then likely no one is there............with some topics its hard for parents or adults to understand....like with my mom she doesn't understand why i got my tonge periced....I try to tel her that its just art.....just like my tatto is.........she doesn't get it....

also when this happends people tend to form opinions about people and they , more offten then not don't care.......
I don't know why this is....SOME parents don't understand there sons or daughters and this can lead to confrentation......

and with the second part of the lyric..."" How many time have your friends let you down? Was anybody there? Did anybody stare? "" i can realate to........

With one of my friends ( i rather not say her name but her insihals are A.D) she has let me down alot .........thats only becasue i don't agree with what she is doing with her life....she runs away from home.....does drugs........goes to parties with people that aren't the best people in da world....and she tires to drag me along with her.

At one time , i did follow this path with her..............i skipped skool......ran away from home......and i thought it would be ok.

But it wasn't..........this is the reason i am going to summer skool...i didn't attend class's, and i got in trouble and was in the office alot... this was becasue of my actions while with A.D.......

I felt to stupid for what i did.....along with this my attitude change, i stared turning on my other friends........and treating them like shit.....all becasue i thought  i was being kool...yea right........then when i started to act more like myself...i had done to much damage........only a few of my friends where there for me......the others had stopped talking to me due to my attitude......even now i haven't made a 180 degree turn.

I still tlak ot that girl..........and i feel that bad side of me comming back when i do.........even recently i have turned on someone that had been my friend for a long time...all becasue i again wanted to be kool...

by writing all this down i have relilized that i have acted like a jerk to alot of people.......i would just like to appologize to those i have hurt, turned my back on, and over all been a real bitch to........"

"event","no matter how you slice it .....friends come and go, but its the ones that last that mean the most. I don't consider myself to be high in the amount of friends. I never really get to close to anyone......cuz i am afriad that if i do then they will leave me.

Like i have known one of my friends for 12 years!!! 12 years...me and her have been threw alot together, but then again since we go to diferent skools we r going apart....I HATE THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING!!!!!! me and her r like sisters....we grew up together and shared tears and laughs together......now I am scared I am going to lose this. I want us to stay as friends forever like we said we would in grade 1.


Then there is one of my ex's friends ( i think ) that me and her fight alot.......we r ok for a bit but then I screw things up, and i take total blame for this.......i am never there for her when she needs me, and i should be,,,,,,, I lied to her about ditching her again, and that was the straw that broke th cammels back ........i blew it with her and she is the only other close girl   friend i have had........and now she won't even talk to me.....and i blame myself .....no one eles but me......

Me and her  have been threw not as much as me and my other friend but still......... I treated her like crap and dumped my problems and her and her mothers shoulders....which was selfish and stupid of me to do.......and in way what she says is right......i threw away a 5 year realtionship  for a boy...that shows how dumb i am.....i have to live with that......

hopefully she reads this, and knows that i am sorry for what i did,,,but i can't prmoise that i won't do this again......this is why i don't have alot of friends.......I treat the good ones like crap and the bad ones like gold....

no matter what we do with our lives.....we must chairish our friends, and what they teach us and hope that they stay in our lives for as long as possible.....

so who r your REAL FRIENDS????

my brother's prom is like nexted week!!!! damn it.....i can't believe that he is graduating.....oh well....me and my mom are going to more out of this neighbourhood in like a year.

she wants to move into a condo. I have no idea why but hey its her $$$......i can't say anything about what she wants to do with it.

Man oh man is this day draggin on......when i got home from my exams @ like 10:15am i called Miles and we talked for 6 hours stright!!!! which is werid cuz on saturday I was totaly pissed @ him....he acted werid on the phone but thats what I am used to with him.

he is comming over tomarrow @ like 9 or 12...he didn't say when.....damn....i wanted to be alone... JOKES!!!...me and him are werid.......like he acts to werid on the phone and he jokes around about things then he's like sorry.....but I can't change who he is...just like he can't change who i am....

I got in a big ASS fight with my friend Eric today. we have been friends for like 12 years.... 

we were talking on icq..and he called me on the phone. I must ahve only said 2 words to him then he hung up.. This really pissed me off becasue whenever the covo is not about what he wants it to be he hangs up!!!......i was pissed and I told him that.....he was saying shit like well i have mat over.....don't get me started on the little prick.....

Eric would rather spend time with him then me, like i don't matter to him @ all......and he has only known mat for like 2 or 3 years....its like i don't matter to him anymore...but this isn't a big surpirse.....he never calls me no  more....never makes plans to see me....then when he does he breaks them..I am at the point right now that I don't want to be his friend anymore.

I really don't care that he said that he does make time.....cuz he doesn't......not no more adleast....why can't it be like in the old days , when me and him where like brother and sister...why does he always put mat or himself infront of me??? he may say that he considers me his sister,,,but then again why would he treat me like that.

Anyways i don't wanna ramble on here.....man i can't wait til july 1st...my aunt is having this HUGE party....and all my cuzins friends r gonna be there,,,,,,,they r aight....anyways talk to you later journal

"event","man am i ever board......well heres what happend since i wrote in here last..... me and jamie go in this huge ( now i am talking huge) fight on msn.... i told him that he never makes time for me anymore and that it hurts me not seeing him.

He made a million excuses.......and i just could take it....in my mind he made me feel 2 feet tall....so i did something that i never wanted to do............................i broke up with him....i cried all night...but in my heart I knew I was doing the right thing....i knew it..................even though i lost his friends as mine .....i get move on, but it will take awhile because Shawn and darice were my close friends and now they don't even want to talk to me :(

I thought that me and Jamie could work out ....i felt that he wasn't that asshole that he is.but all he ever did was drink,,,,,drink......and drink......................he broke promises, he lied........and he was not caring towards me emotionaly @ all..........i don't need that..... I already had been threw that with other guys in the past.........

I feel that i have done the right thing.......i do..........i don't neeed that stress in my life........these are the years i should be hanging out with my friends haveing fun  ...............not waiting by the phone hopping that he will call.................

Then about about 3 or for days ago i met this guy named Miles...............he was so amazing....i skipped school ( whci i shouldn't have) and spent the afternoon with him......  we chilled @ his house and like talked about everything...........then we took his dog BRADY ( cutiest dowy ) and we went to the park.............we were like chillin there and i was watching him play with brady...........man he is so cute..........then me and him where fighting ( playfully) and that was fun....

then on friday he came over..........he was really quiet in the car,,,,,,,,,so i felt awcward....but i tired to talk to him,,,,,,,,he was like ""hu?"" ........anyways when we got to my house my mom rented us a game to play. We were in the basement and i was on the phone with Laura........he atacked me when i was talking to her and then he hung up on her.........i was luahging  @ the whole thing and i called laura back to appologize...

Then we played Zelda.......he sat on the couch and I sat infront of him on the floor...he started to give me a shoulder rub..............man it was gooooooooooooooooood.........then he told me to move up onto the couch so its eaiser........i was like ""aight"" while i am still playing the game. The he put his arms around me ..............in my mind i was like ""YES"" heheheh then he kissed me on my cheek....i think he was scared to do this before becuase he thought that i would pull away......LIKE HELL I WOULD HAVE!..

Then me and him played cruse the world for like 2 hourse stright....................he kissed me during the game and like when it was paused ( he paused it alot) i felt to safe with him..........like al the pain that i had gone through with Jamie had been erased..... Then dom and Bojan came over for a bit..............we chilled in the basement....man i was like so happy ...................dom kept on say "" awwwwwwwwwwwww young love"" i was like shut up!!!!.........then they left....................then sorry to say but miles had to go home cuz he had a curfew,,,,,so my mommmy drove him home.......i didn't want that night to end....NEVER!!! then on saturday he had to work but he called me lik 10 times......and he said that on thursday when he had to go to that football game he couldn't think of anything eles but me....

Then he called me last night @ like 1130....................we talked for about an hour.......  then i went to bed............... I love being with him.............we see each other like every day.........and he is comming over on friday and we r seeing a movie then he is comming over to play video games...hehehehheh.............ya know.........when i lost jamie i never thought that i could have been happy enough to move on...............with Miles i am happy, and  i hope that we stay together fo awhile....

I AM SO MAD AT JAMIE!!!!!! man he hasn't called me in awhile...........but he works so.............but he is like never online or anything....and he wants me always to do things with him...and his friends......but he can't even do anything i want to do.........this is turning out to m\be a nightmare.......He is sopost to be like sleeping over on friday but he hasn't called,,,,,,,,,,last time i talked to him was like on monday or tuesday. I hate it when he does this.......and i just let him get away with it.....man i really dumb :*(
hopefully things will get better between us.......cuz we share the same friends..........damn........why can't he just call.........in the begining he always would call, like everyday............now i am luckey to hear him let alone see him....... he spends more time drinking with his friends then with me....thats wrong and it kills me................
I haven't told any of my friends this but when i go home...i cry all night..........when my mother asks me whats wrong ...i yell @ her....which i shouldn't do..........i am just so hurt but jamie right now that i find it hard not to be sooooooo angry...............i want to be with him , but why do i have to be the one waiting by the phone hopeing that he wiilll call...to make plans to see me.......
WHY?!?!?!?...........and when i do see him....he is drinking.........( not like drunk but socaily) , and i only see him ( if i am luckey ) on the weekends, but i haven't latley........well i can't really do anything about that because when i call him he says he will call back but he never does....

"event","what can a girl do????.......with all the stress put on us to be perfect. The guys that i have been in contact with only want the girls that are slim and smart and easy......but i have a question......why should that be the only type of girls that are the most populair with the guyz?? Me myself , if a guy doesn't except me then oh well,,,,, i am not about to change my looks or do things that i don't want to do just to please him.

why is it that if a girl sleeps around she is called a slut, but if a guy does the exstact same thing then he is consider a hero or a kool guy?.. how can we make a double standard???.....its unfair to girls....they are look at by some as just objects, nothin more then objects.

Now i am not bashing guys don't get me wrong here , but in soceity guys get away with way more than girls.


MAN I FEEL BETTER NOW!!!

To make matters worse there were no animals anymore. the first day was kinda crappy at first then we went to the wave pool and swallowed about 1 gallon of water lol and then we had dinner @ Ruby Tuesdays that was good, alot of laughes man i thought i was gonna die laughing. We went to the hotel and went to the pool and swam a little then we went to the arcade and that was really fun. We went back to the room and watched 50 first dates lol that was sooooo funny.

Oh no, it is for dirty little boys, not for updstanding gentleman, nor for me, because I cannot allow myself to be an upstanding gentleman, for that would take all the fun out of life. Alas once more.

I am indeed most disheartened not to have seen you since returning to school. Would you like to share tales over some spotted dick?

To cake! The cake! I want cake! 

Mother, where do you hide?

Red heads are dangerous! They bite! The hat needs to be remeasured! With what, dear Henry? A bucket? Not I, said the goose! The hen shall have to bake the bread herself, over Frodo's dead body!"

I went to the hospital wing today, because Ginny asked me too. Madam Pomfrey, the minx, was really quite full on.

I have a question for you all! Red? Or mice?"

Private to Work Group People: Seeing as none of us seem terribly interested in doing the assignment, I have allocated myself the job of allocating jobs.

There will be a meeting in the library during lunch tomorrow. I have handouts and schedules for everybody. I'm afraid if you do not turn up, I will have no choice but to assign you with the task of telling either Professor Lupin or Professor Weasley why you have decided to be completely disinterested in passing.

Private to Mandy: Perhaps we ought to have a Ravenclaw meeting. Keep everyone calm and well informed that nothing is in fact going on, that we know of. Also to give the younger children a chance to speak up, and offer them some form of comfort.

I'll see Flitwick if you want to start informing people that we are more likely than not going to gather in the common room after dinner.

Your sparkle isn't as sparkly as it should be. Would you like some cake with sprinkles? It may sparkle you up! I have just received another large cake from my Mother, and cannot possibly eat it on my own. I am withering away without your company. 

I also have a few questions to ask you about the Transfiguration homework. My housemates have reached a dead end in question 3b, and perhaps you could shed some light on the situation."

There will be a gathering of students at the Three Broomsticks having an IMMENSELY FABULOUS time. The first two drinks will be paid for by none other than your host Michael Corner. 

SO, if you are planning to attend, please leave a comment so I can arrange to have our table booked in advance."

I've been having odd dreams lately. They are very full of colour and crying babies, and after talking to the Divination 'expert' I have realised that they mean nothing. Except that I am insane, but that is of no surprise.

I tripped down a set of stairs this morning, much to my amusement and all those around, but now my head is throbbing and I seem to have developed bruises all over my wrists. When I push them, they change from a red purple to a black, which is surprising. 

You may not be able to tell, but I am in fact quite bored. You can only compare charts for so long before the colours start to blend in together, and my life is so full of colour recently what with the bruises and the dreams."

Cons:

She could say no.

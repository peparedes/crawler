GNNAAAAAHHH!
Why is it so friggin' hard to make everyone satisfied?!?

=___= Gawd....
I like helping my friends and sharing time with them because it makes me happy too, but at the moment I have the feeling that, whenever I do something for one of my friends, another one feels neglected because of it/gets jealous/gets angry/whatever. And this kinda pisses me off.
I really live for making my friends happy. It's one of the things that really, really means something to me. But this is really just.... ARGH!
Yesterday I even had a fight with my best friend =_= (Just a short one, but yeah...)
Just because I'm RPing more with someone else at the moment.
What do they want me to do?! Rip myself in two so I can give everyone, everytime my full attention?!

I'm bored and feeling lonely and have mood swings like a pregnant women. I have nothing to do or at least not the motivation to do anything... Not even drawing and RPing is fun anymore and I'm mean to my friends, which is the worst for me.
*sighs*
Perhaps I should try to write something... Or draw some Teddy-smut to cheer myself up .____."

"event","Inspired by an artist on tegaki, I finally drew Steelflame's big brother 8D

Let me intodruce you:
Crimsonflame!
His real name is Racket, but he does not like being called so, because that's the name his father gave him. (Teddy is the only one who's allowed to call him by his real name)
He ran away from home to become a musician when he was still a teenager and now Teddy is the only member of his family he is still in contact with. He loves his little brother to death and even named himself after him. ('Crimson' because Steelflame is red and 'flame' because it's the same ending as his brother's name)

His father (a former police officer. Now he's a security guard) is 42 and his mother (a former member of a biker gang (she got arrested by Teddy's dad. That's how they met and fell in love XDDD) Now she's just a house wife) is 37.
He also has a sibling who's living in another country and is 20 now, but I did not draw him |D'''

Daddy was inspired by a character of the Silent Hill RP of my best friend and me. Mommy is based on Ichiko and Momoko from Kamikaze Girls XD (Only her character, not her appearance)

Hm....
I do see a little problem here:
Teddy's dad is 42. Only a few years older than Overload...
Daddy wont like Over XD''''
And his mum is younger than Overload.
She will definitely like Over. Very much. A bit too much perhaps XD"

In my opinnion, there's no better Convention here in Germany X3
I can't wait to meet all my friends there (the one's who are not living in Hamburg). And I even have a new Cosplay for it. It's still top secret though X3 I'm doing it together with my Edooooo.  (Luv her D8 She's uver awesome. One of the best Cosplayers I know (and I know many) and certainly one of the nicest persons I met over animexx.de (Which are many, too xD 90+?))

Nothing to dooooooo.... art bloooock....
Even drawing on Tegaki is not really fun anymore... (because I suck at it)
Perhaps I should finish reading the books I've lend from Riedel =3=

Edit:
Mhm... The book is quite good =w=
'You slay me' by Katie MacAlister, an erotic novel...

But I'm also reading 'The City of Dreaming Books' by Walter Moers at the moment. It's an awesome book X3 A friend of mine gave it to me as a birthday present back in June.
Starts out a bit boring but it gets quite interesting with the time."

I love all of them so I thought I should post them here 8D
<lj-cut text=""Beware of the NON-Transformers OCness!!!"">

<img src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f385/Pandablubb/Diana.jpg"" border=""0"">
First: Captain Diana, First Princess of the Kingdom of Atlas. She joined the army to defend her people and fight for her land.

<img src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f385/Pandablubb/Alice.jpg"" border=""0"">
Alice, Second Princess of Atlas and Dianas little sister.
(I don't like her yet XD She's an annoying little girl, but we needed a character like her for the story)
She has a crush on Lord Adam and dislikes her sister for betraying her and joining the army.

<img src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f385/Pandablubb/Fay.jpg"" border=""0"">
Defayon (Fay). He's an elf one of the 37 royal children of the Kingdom of Terra (the enemy country of Atlas) and he was supposed to be the next king but did not want to. That's why he traveled to Atlas, long before the war between the two countries started and became a citizen of Atlas. Now he's the bodyguard and caretaker of Princess Alice.

<img src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f385/Pandablubb/Palith.jpg"" border=""0"">
Palith is an elf, just like Fay, but he's not of royal blood. He lived near the border to Atlas, but after his sister was murdered and he himself badly injured, he flew into the woods of Yggdrasil for shelter. He remained silent since then in honour of his sister because she was mute. Whenever he is forced to say a word, he punishes himself afterwards.
Finn, a white phoenix, is his only companion and he believes that the soul of his sister was reincarnated into this bird.

<img src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f385/Pandablubb/Adam.jpg"" border=""0"">
Lord Adam's true name is Prince Adamant. He's one of Fay's half-brothers but the two of them never met. He's a demon but disguised himself as a human by cutting off his ears, tail and wings.
Adam went to Atlas years before Fay because he was looking for the secret power which was hidden by both countries millenia ago. He found out it was converted into Yggdrasil, the world tree.

<img src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f385/Pandablubb/Leaf.jpg"" border=""0"">
Leaf is the soul and power of Yggdrasil. Adam kidnaps her and tries to get her power.

<img src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f385/Pandablubb/Kim.jpg"" border=""0"">
My favourite character: Kimbaile (Kim). She's a Tigra (some kind of anthropomorphic tiger. Half tiger, half human) and part of the best mercenary/bountyhunter duo in Terra. She's very tiny and looks quite young, but she's 60 years old (equivalent to 17 human years) and very strong and agile. She's hot-tempered and loves to fight. Obviously. Not even Adam is as bloodthirsty as her.
She has the habbit to call herself a man, which makes her and Eremis' relationship gay in her eyes. It's quite confusing for everyone else, even for Eremis, but she likes it this way...

<img src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f385/Pandablubb/eremes.jpg"" border=""0"">
Last but not least: Kim's partner in crime, Eremis. Called Rem (but only by her. Everyone else will be killed for it). He's a Berserker and friggin tall and muscular. In contrary to his partner, he's quiet and calm and sometimes a bit grumpy. He cares for Kim and keeps her under control.

-

Alice, Fay and Leaf are drawn by Riedel.

We also have two soldiers of Atlas, Steve and Sam, but the character sheets for them are not done yet. Steve is an arrogant womanizer and asshole and Sam, his best friend, eats all the time X3 I love these two. Have to draw them, when I get time

Mode</strong>: Yamaha Grizzly ATV<br /><strong>Personality</strong>: His whole family was part of the Decepticon army and he tries to follow this tradition even though he would prefer being neutral.  He has a strong sense for duty and justice (which doesn&rsquo;t go well with him being a decepticon), is quite hot-tempered and reckless and gets himself in danger quite often because of that. He cares for his comrades and never leaves someone behind.<br /><strong>Abilities/skills</strong>: He is specialized in close-combat and sword fighting. Since his weapon is extremely big and he is not the strongest mech, he has to use his whole body to use it. For that he has the grills on his feet so he can kick the lower blade in the direction of his opponent without injuring himself. He&rsquo;s also fond of using kicks when his opponent is too close for hitting him fast enough with his sword.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/pandablubb/pic/0000dk20/""><img width=""80"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/pandablubb/pic/0000dk20/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br /><strong>Strength:</strong> 4<br /><strong>Intelligence</strong>: 7<br /><strong>Endurance</strong>: 8<br /><strong>Speed:</strong> 6<br /><strong>Courage:</strong> 8<br /><strong>Willpower: </strong>10<br /><strong>Firepower:</strong> 6<br /><strong>Skill:</strong> 9<br /><br /><strong>Likes:</strong> relaxing after battles,  reading, fighting, rain <br /><strong>Dislikes:</strong> Highgrade Energon (he gets drunk real fast), loosing<br /><strong>Fears</strong>: being unable to fulfill his duties<br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

Today while watching a Bollywood-movie (Boothnath. It's friggin cute X3) I had nothing better to do than to try drawing a new OC. ...too bad I'll never use him/her, because I have no OC-based RPs T___T (And it's depressing to draw my OCs without any companions)

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/pandablubb/pic/0000bp64/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/pandablubb/pic/0000bp64/s320x240"" width=""103"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Don't know whether it's a femme or a mech...
He/She was inspired by Alice L. Malvin from Pumpkin Scissors (that's why the OC uses the same weapon as her *luv* A double-bladed sword which is far bigger than him/her <a href=""http://randomc.animeblogger.net/image/Pumpkin%20Scissors/Pumpkin%20Scissors%20-%2016%20-%20Large%2019.jpg"">sword reference</a>) though, so it was supposed to be a femme at first. But now it looks more like a mech.
Btw: he/she transforms into a Yamaha Grizzly ATV. Because I love Quads X3

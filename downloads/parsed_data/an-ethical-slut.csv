I've got too much to worry about right now without having to worry about who might be possibly on my friends list.

If you are seeing this and would like to be added back leave a comment and give me a good reason."

"event","I put images of myself in this journal that are intimate and personal and choose to share them with those of you who are friends on my journal. 

I do not, however, enjoy getting rude emails or instant messages, if I do get a message from someone that I think is offensive or inappropriate I will not hesitate to remove you from my friends list. 

If I find out that my pictures are anywhere on the internet besides where I have put them I will have to make my screening process much more intense and most likely delete anyone on my friends list who I have not A-met or B-had contact with in conversation about things other than my pictures. 

I am posting this because I have recently been receiving emails from people who apparently know my name, email and have seen my pictures and are being inappropriate and rude. 

I have had to delete my photobucket account because of this and thus any of my pictures on my journal that were hosted there will now be unavailable. I am sorry to those of you who enjoy these pictures and are not involved, however I had no choice. 

I do not want to have to make cuts to my FL, but if it comes to it, I will. 

Please be courteous and think before being an ass. 

I don't mind comments or instant messages that are encouraging or complimenting, as long as they remain appropriate. Please, use your judgment. If you wouldn't say it to someone in person, don't say it to me. 

Thank you for your time."

"event","Part 1: The Birth of You
Were you a planned baby? Hell no, I was nearly put up for adoption. 
Were you the first? For my mom yeah, for my father, no. 
Who was present at your birth? Couldn't tell ya. 
Were your parents married when you were born? Hah, nope
What is your birthdate? 8/18

Part 2: The Family
Are you parents married or divorced? Neither, they were never together
Are you an only child? Nope
If you have siblings, are you oldest, middle, or youngest? Oldest of the ones I am in contact with
What are your sibling's names? Jessica and Benjamin
Do you have step parents? For sure

Part 3: The Friends
Do you have more than one best friend? I don't consider anyone a ""best"", so all of my friends... Yes? 
What do you like to do when you are together? Depends on the day/person/money situation
Do you share the same interests? Sometimes, it varies. I wouldn't want all of my friends to be interested in all the same things, that would be boring.

Part 4: Your Personality
How high/low is your self esteem? Depends on when you talk to me, generally pretty low. 
Do you get depressed about things easily? I hate this question. I have suffered from Depression, and may still. So, yes? 
Are you an extrovert (outgoing) or an introvert? A little of both, for the most part I am an introvert, but I do use my voice. 
Are you happy? When I can be
Do you live life to the fullest? I don't know. 

Part 5: Your Appearance
Are you comfortable with the way you look? Sometimes, not generally... but really&nbsp; who is entirely confident with their physical appearance? 
Describe your hair. Short and red

Part 6: The Past
Were you a strange child? Oh lord, yes. Still am. ;)
Do you have the same friends as when you were a child? For the most part no, but I guess that depends on what you consider Childhood 
Was there anything in your childhood that was traumatizing? Of course. My Mom's first husband and father of my sister was a cocaine addict who would physically and mentally abuse me while my mother worked the night shift at gas stations to keep our family from living on the streets. That is just one of many stories. But.... I turned out more than okay. :)

Part 7: The Future 
What is your ambition? Find a career that will make me happy every day. 
Are you scared of growing old? Not age-wise. Old, I think, is a state of mind. I will never be ""old"".
Do you want to get married? I think every girl, deep down, has some little voice telling her that she wants to. So, yes, I would like to get married some day. 

Part 8: The Outdoors
Do you prefer indoors or outdoors? Depends on the weather and what I am doing..
Favorite Season. Autumn, the smell and the colors... it is amazing. 
Do you like walking in the rain? Rain, the right rain, can really turn me on. 

Part 9: Food
Are you a vegetarian? I don't have the will power, or the motivation for that matter...
What is your favorite dessert? Don't make me choose! 
What is your favorite restaurant? Anywhere (good) Sushi is served
Are you a fussy eater?Not at all

Part 10: Love
Are you single or taken? *sigh* taken, and amazingly happy. 
If taken who is the lucky guy/girl? That's for me to know.. ;)
Do you think love is the best feeling in the world? Knowing that the person you love feels the same, if not more, and can't take their eyes off of you. 
Do you believe in love at first sight? No.

Part 11: Experiences
What was one of your greatest experiences? I really couldn't tell you...
What was one of the worst? Again... there have been many, I prefer not to single one out..
Have you ever done drugs? I grew up in a small town and hung out with the bad kids.. what do you think? 
Have you ever thought you were going to die? Yes, mainly because of my own self."

I was in bed with S, he was lying on top of me and told me to put my arms around him. I did so and started running his back. As I began to move my hands over his body I started to tremble. There was this tremendous energy between us. I was so turned on I was shaking! 

Soon he lied next to me and started playing with me. I looked into his eyes and was speechless, we were so connected it was unbearable. I was hugging him as his hands searched and found my clit and started to rub. I was so turned on. We were both nearly silent, looking into each others arms, rubbing against one another. 

It felt as if we were one being. I was him and he was me and we were melting together in out ecstasy.&nbsp; I just could feel him, it was the most amazing experience. I have never been so connected to another human being in my life. 

We were both silent, until I came. As soon as I came he grabbed me in a hug and I started crying. Then laughing.

It was unbearable."

I mean, I know I am attracted to men, I can see S playing with himself and get hot, ot when we are together and he is rubbing against me, but when I am alone and have to think of something to get off... it is always women. <br /><br />Maybe it's because I haven't had enough contact&nbsp; with women. I mean, besides last weekend the only contact I'd had with another girl was last january, and even then nothing really happened. I guess in my mind women are perfect and sexy and I haven't had enough of them. I've had a taste and I want more MORE MORE! <br /><br />Since I've been out only 2 women have shown any intrest in me sexually, and none where I am currently. I need to find someone that I can fuck down here, where I am, instead of everyone that wants to fuck me being 2 hours away!!! GAH! I am getting sexually frustrated. I could have sex every day, even two times a day and want more. I love sex. Man do I."

"event","Well, this is my first entry in my new journal.

I guess you could say it is for the more personal aspects of my life, I'm sure you can guess what that means. 

I have been with my boyfriend for over a year now. We are in a poly relationship, which means that we are free to date others. He has another girlfriend, who is also poly and has a fiance. I currently am not actively dating anyone else, but occasionally will go out with others, including his other girlfriend and her fiance."

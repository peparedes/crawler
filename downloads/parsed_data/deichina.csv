Alright.  Had October Holiday this past week.  Went to Xi An and saw the Terra Cotta Soldiers (eigth wonder of the world, recently added to the ""wonders"" list hahaha).  Oh ya, my grandparents came! I am proud of them-- that flight is murder.  Going to the World Carnival tomorrow with Richard.  No, it's not a date... I think.  HAHA.
  
I miss everyone alot! About Homecoming week= we dont have one.  Nope, and no cheerleaders either.  Odd. 

What's everyone doing for Hallowe'en (sp, its cooler that way with the ') and Dia de los Muertos?  

Ok, mucho amor,

"event","<lj-cut>the play im in is on the 3rd, so we've been having a ton of rehearsals lately.  plus auditions for the play after school.  not to mention homework.
 
yes, school is officially started.  woot. woohoo, i mean to say, now that everyone is saying woot.
  
i found out that we will do the mile timed test tomorrow.  i havent ran in forever, and will suck.  can i trade bodies w/ you?  and our first unit will be cross-country-- AHHH!!!! oh well, at least i will be in shape... Still.  you know.  
 
matt is being confusing, and i havent talked to him in a while.  i was thinking bout flirting with the aussie friend of his.  he's pretty cute as well, just blond.  matt is still cuter.  darn.  hopefully it will jealousfy him.  and that is a word, yes.
 
also hopefully i will get Helen of Troy in Trojan Women.  I know I wont get too major of a part, because alot of seniors tried out, but Helen would be mucho fun anyways.  cast list is posted tomorrow... eep!
 
today, i got a birthday party invite from this girl in my algebra class.  ive probably said two sentences to her, but here it is, my name on it and everything.  this is the second week, and already i am more popular than at middle school by far.  soo much better.  yes, i know there were alot of people that were invited, but still.  it counts in my world.  but my play is on the same day, so i can't go.  i didn't know what to get her anyways... too bad, she seemed nice.
 
i miss you infinitly.  yours till niagra falls *corny laugh*,
heather
p.s.  i agree.  staley guys are pervs.  at least alot of them are.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First play rehearsal, and I got part of the chorus of Trojan women, as I suspected, being a freshman and all.  Alot of seniors tried out, so they basically all got the main roles, you know how it is.  So it really wasn't a surprise.  Only I met the HS theatre teacher (the one who'll do the sound of music) the other day at play practice (outside of school), and he repeatedly told me what a great job I did, so I like him alot, obviously.  He really gets acting/actors too.  i will be able to work real well under him, i know, he's just that sort of director.  
 
Oooo!!!! About the being more popular thing-- I got asked out by this sophmore in my spanish class today!!! He asked if I wanted to hang out sometime and you know in the ""secret language of high schoolers"" thats ""hey i like you, lets go out"".  total body language too.  you know what i mean.  I sit next to him in spanish, and he's nice and all, but I'm really not that attracted to him.  I've got Matt and Lachlin (sp? no idea, the cute aussie) for eye candy.  I said sure, ill hang out with you, but wasn't really thinking at the time that he'd think i was his ""gf"".  so now spanish will be real akward because ill have to tell him that i dont want a real relationship with him.  chloe (the girl with the b-day party) was asked out by him last year, and she told me that he'll think i'm his girlfriend.  oh ya, apparantly shes ""popular"" so i would have gone to a ""cool"" party.  i HATE BEING ASKED OUT.  unless its by a guy i actually like.  i always say yes to guys i like for like 2 days than hate myself and break up with them. AHH.  
 
English was good today, i had my book club group [with matt and lachlin (seriously have no idea how to spell that...)] and got to talk with the guys.  sooo fun.  today they were talking about scars and broken bones (how manly. haha) and apparantly matt is a firework-loving skateboarder guy and has many scars and broken bones.  he asked me if i had any broken bones, etc and i told him that i broke my ankle on a 4-wheeler.  he goes ""yes!""  and i was quite pleased with myself, i will not lie.  ok mom is yelling at me alot, so i will e-mail more later
-heather!!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have to run a mile and a quarter tomorrow.  and then we'll play softball.  the softball i am looking forward too....  i will try your idea, although i am constantly thinking and it will be hard for me to not.  give me strength, oh great Wendes!  haha.
 
About the Mitch breakup thing: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!
stupid.  can he not find anyone else that will stroke his ego?  i mean, sarah.... they are soo going to get married I know it.  that way sarah will always have someone to gloat over and obsess about and he will always have her to make him feel manly and important.  yep, theyre made for each other.  why do guys always expect the girls to be the entertaining ones whenever they start to go out?  i mean, really, we want some fun too.  make US laugh for once.  jeezzz.....  im dreading going to spanish, really dont want to face the sophmore guy... dont want to go out w/ you, matt and lachlan (found out how to spell it today) are hotter!!!! gosh.  always asked out by the guys i dont want to go out with, and having good manners, dont want to be mean.  you know, ""give him a chance!"" or whatever.  and then, the guys i really like dont ask. sooooo typical.
 
lets see, answer to the question of the e-mail:  it really depends on the class on who i sit with.  i have a very diverse group of friends so far.  don't know any of them THAT well, you know, just talk to them in class and in the halls and whatnot.  no one like you for sure.  i usually eat lunch with the ""different"" people (not retardedly, like the eccentric dressers, etc. u know what im talking about), but today, i sat with chloe, nina, alexandra, and their group of friends.  well, i sat there for like 5 mins, then me and alexandra went to the pta store and looked around.  neither of us really like lunch.  
 
ooo, about the Trojan woman thing-- i have a bad costume.  all the women are dressed in brown (ick) and have white painted faces.  ahh!!! everyone else gets nice greek dresses/togas/whatever and we get to be ugly.... i see no reason for it at all.  oh well...  *mutters darkly to self*.  plus the women only go to rehearsals on fridays and that means i cant talk to my other friends that aren't in the chorus (they only come mon. & wed.)  and i wanted to meet the guy who got the lead, he seemed nice and looks like a typical actor (button up shirt, long slightly wavy blond hair, etc).
 
as for me being popular:  i have no idea how to be popular.  and how would you have seen that coming?  well, its not really that hard to be popular in china, seeing with the lack of white people... i wish you could be here to be ""cool"" with me!!! 
 
MY questions of the e-mail:  who do YOU normally eat lunch with?  any new friends? teachers: good or bad?  
 
miss you 'till the butter flies!!!
haha

"event","Ok, I am in Digital Photography now, and am very bored.  I have wandered around the school forever, and decided to now come to the library and get on the computer.  Yay me.  I wanted to make this more updated, so that's what I am doing, if you did not already guess.  Oh wait, in English today, we were told to never say ""I am writing about..."" so that last sentence was bad.  We were given a little story to help us understand better the concept of leads.  Here it is for your viewing enjoyment:  Imagine that you are a bank teller.  You have had your two cups of coffee and several customers have come in already to get money.  A new customer walks up to your bank window and slids you a note.  The note says: ""Don't say a word.  Don't even look up..."".  Now imagine you are the same teller.  The same person walks up to you and slids you a note.  This note says:  ""In this note, I will tell you that I am about to rob you."" Which one would you give more respect to?

Personally, I find the second note more polite so....

Anyways. I was going to write something only I forgot what it was...
Oh well.  That often happens. I have no idea when lunch is... hopefully I won't miss it.  It wouldn't really be THAT much of a tragedy, I find lunch boring.  But today I am hungry, and I just realized that if anyone's reading this, you really don't care, most likely.

Haha, there are these girls next to me talking about the sixth Harry Potter book, and one of them is REALLY worked up about Dumbledore dying.  I so saw that coming, I am sorry.  I thought it would be either Malfoy (please no!!!) or Dumbledore.  I loved Malfoy in that book.  He was so cute when he was vulnerable.  (p.s. Wendes-- love the new icon)

Well, must go, miss you all infinitly!

Stuff you can't get in China:  JIF peanut butter, grape jelly, wendeses, scamps, country cds, charlie and the chocolate factory (its nnot in theatres yet here),  mexican food (well, there is ONE mexican restaurant, but it looks disgusting), combination CD, radio, alarm clocks, GOOD FINGERNAIL POLISH (i got ripped off for this cheap little thing).  thats all i can think of right now....  but just pictures of people and texas stuff and any little thing you think i might like is good with me.

"event","<lj-cut>hola,
 
sorry it's taken me so long to reply, I have been pretty busy with baby dragon camp(orientation...) and gettin set up for... dare i speak the word-- school!  Most apologies, Milady (de Winter.  From the three musketeers by Alexandre Dumas, the Count of Monte Cristo guy).  Anyways... I think now is a good time for a moment of silence for the summer.  We will miss the summer.  Not one of us here can deny that it was a must-needed break from the stress of school.  It was a wonderful...thing.  *moment of silence, shedding of alot of tears*...
 
Ok, I think I am good.  I seem to have gotten into a run in with a cough germ and now I am sick.  How annoying.  I mean, all summer I have been relatively healthy, then two days before school, I get sick. AHH!!!  Is there no end to the madness?  Will I never get a break?!?  *goes momentarily insane* *coughs*  ick.
 
Wendes, I am so proud of your running!!!  Jealous, you actually like to run, I can't stand it...  Oooh, I went to the gym the other day and after doing the treadmill, I did some arm weight lifting exercises.  Ya.  Only I put too much weight on each machine and overdid it.  My arms are still sore.  eep.  And by the way, your mom was not making a mountain out of a molehill, seven mills on terrain is insanely good!  I would die.  Most likely.
 
I don't know why little boys don't like having their pictures taken... I personally like it alot.  But that might be vanity...  darn.  Not a good quality, *irons fingers like Dobby*  bad Heather, bad!  I am sorry for your troubles with that issue.
 
Don't want to start school either,  all the stress and having to make new friends, all that jazz.  Making new friends is kinda annoying, if you know what I mean.  It's not that bad if you know someone already, then you can talk to him/her if the conversation dies or something.  You know what I mean?  Oh well, once the play starts, I'll meet people.  It's way easier to make friends while doing a play, in my opinion.  I know acting is a hard profession, but I figure i can sell some paintings or maybe blood when I'm low on cash.  haha.  I also hope to marry someone with some cash and a steady job.  But you can never tell what will happen.
 
Well, adios!  Good luck with you-know-what
Ciao, love (going all brit on you)

Anyways. *regains composure*

I just got back from Qing Dao.  Guess what type of city that is?
A COASTAL CITY!!!!  Which means that-- I got to go to the beach!  The beach is my favorite, seeing as i could drive to galveston in thirty minutes for most of my life.  Oh, how I missed it.  And when I got to the beach, I got hit on by these two English guys.  Well, really, I was hit on by just one of them.  The other guy just stood there.  Only the just-stood-there guy was way cuter, because the guy who talked to me looked like a rat.  And they were way older than me, mid-twenties maybe. (thats never stopped me before *claps hand over mouth*) They eventually figured out i was younger than I appeared and left to hit on this Chinese girl.  
Plus, we gotta hike through the mountains! I am a naturish girl so it was soo refreshing.

Well, my laptop's battery is almost gone, gotta go.

still not here. 
hey, i want to go to a boy scout jamboree, sounds fun! roasting marshmallows by a campfire, sleeping in a tent near TREES, hearing & seeing animals, stargazing (more than one star!), being around friends your own age, etc etc etc.  i'm sorta bored.  
i have mixed emotions about school. i sorta want to go just to see what it'll be like and to try and make friends.  also for theatre.  i will confide in you, i am nervous about the whole friend deal, because this school is an elementary, middle, and high school (its HUGE) and alot of people will have been together for a long time, and you know i am not the most talkative person in the world, unless i know you really well. i will make friends during the play, because it is easy there.  and i am also not looking forward to the work, i am going to be soo behind.  i also have heard that ISB gives out tons of homework, and that isnt very reassuring. well, i need to stop feeling sorry for myself now, and it might help to stop listening to coldplay, they make me sad by capturing emotions too well.  also stop listening to 'songs about rain' . even though it is raining here, that song is also sad.
ok happy thoughts, uh chocolate, theatre, johnny depp, wendes, jodie, etc.  ok im good.
i know what you mean about the summer lazy thing. my dad wants us to go to all these famous ancient china places, and its fun and all, but we dont have to go to every one now.  i just want to laze around and regain energy for school.  good luck with the tourny though.
the people of china are very fashionable.  they dress nice, i mean girls wear dresses here and high heels on dates to the mall.  chinese girls wear high heels alot.  they have great fashion sense, and care alot about what people think of them. it is very easy to get clothes here, the only problem is that if you go to the mall, they have the good quality desiner clothes, but if you go to the silk market you can get cheap knockoffs for alot less money.  oh the dilemma.  i dont mind the knockoffs, but the quality is not that great.  oh well.
In the mall in the basement, they have this italian style clothes store, and it has the cutest clothes.  they are eccentric, just like i like, and i love that store. only it is way expensive. darn. 
OMG i cant believe what just happened! derek just called his gameboy game a son-of-a-bitch game!! he is ten!  i have never heard him cuss before, this is not good.  he has this friend who cusses all the time and is a real jerk, whom i dont like, and i think he is influencing derek.  omg. sorry if i seem to be making a huge deal out of this, but for derek this is.  he gets really into games and if he loses, he'll make everyone else annoyed by yelling at the game. he needs to control his anger. i mean, its a gameboy game... its not real life, and i repeatedly tell him this.
long e-mail, sorry dont have much to do, and i like talking to you.
miss you tons!
xoxo,
heather

i wanted to write you an e-mail, so how have you been, what have you been doing, how is everything?  Not to be abrupt or anything, haha.  have you and mitch gone anywheres yet?
havent been doing much lately, dogsitting, going to derek's soccer camp, etc.  i am excited because i am going to the real madrid game tomorrow (saturday) and man u on tues!  go beckham, go ronaldo! i am also waiting for my copy of harry potter and the half-blood prince.  it is taking forever.  have you got it/read it yet?  if so, is it good?
dang, too many questions, sorry.  ask me some, if you want, haha.
i will tell you something about china then.  there are several good international schools in beijing, but i had a choice of two, WAB (western academy of Beijing) or ISB (international school of Beijing). i chose ISB, and good thing too. WAB is a scary looking school.  all the buildings and the gates are painted either blue, red, yellow, or green.  it is a very happy school.  too happy, if you know what i mean... on the other hand, ISB is all gray and drab on the outside and reminds people of a prison... guess there's no in-between. oh well. hopefully i'll live through the year.

i have met some very friendly people here, everyone is trying to make friends is what ma says.  this one girl i met at church was nice, and ma went to say hi to her when she was getting derek from bible class.  she found out i was my mom's daughter and went, ""oh, heather's your daughter? shes so pretty!"" 
when mom told me this i thought she was lying to boost my confidence, but she was serious.  i was very surprised, seeing as i barely know the girl, but flattered, seeing as she is older (who isnt? lol) than me, and i had just met her. u know. it was odd. but nice.

you're probably right, party guest # 34 is pretty lame. i can beat that. i might get one of the kids, and that is not bad.  stupid seniors, getting all the leads....
o well.
it was quite inconsiderate of my skool to let derek see people in his grade, and me see none. gosh! i will have to be angry at them now.
that aussie was hot.  especially the accent. and i love accents (country, british, aussie, french... etc etc etc, as long as i can understand them)
and he was quite fit. yay!
Oh!!! i have bought cool cheap stuff!!!
i bought a burberry shirt, a silk skirt, and a dior purse!! they are probably knock off, but i honestly dont care.  derek got a man u jersey and my mom got a burberry purse. momma is surprisingly a great bargainer.  it was cool. only thing is that the electronics are not as cheap as i thought, because japan and china are having issues, and electronics are from japan mostly.
oh well.
chinese food is great. i had beijing kao ya (roast duck) and it was awesome!! they cut up the duck and you dip it in this sauce, and put it on this skinny tortilla thing like a fajita and you can add cucumber and skinny cut up onion.
well, gtg, miss u!

i wish i had mystical magic powers... that would be sweet.  then we could both have the power to defeat voldemort.  maybe if we distracted voldemort, then harry could spend more time learning how to vent his frustrations in positive ways.  hahaha.  and maybe get a (good) girlfriend.  i dont think cho was a smart move.  she was too..crying. and cedric loving.
but enough about harry potter.
when i took a tour of my skool, the high skoolers were on a tour/field trip thing, so i didnt get a chance to see them. but i did see this hot aussie who worked there. ;)
Maria and Liesl are the two parts i was thinking of too.  well, they are the two best female parts in the musical.  only i probably will get like party guest #34.  because i will be a freshman.  i might not tho, hopefully not.  but it will be fun, nonetheless.

china is a good place and all, but summer here is not as fun at all.  too smoggy, theres barely any sunshine.  and i have no wendes to have summer parties, or whatever with.  i miss you muchos y muchos!
speaking of spanish, i had to take this spanish placement test, and the teacher was talking in the really fast, mumbling sort of spanish, so i could barely understand him.  and he was trying to make me conjugate into these ways i didnt know how, and i have come to the conclusions that spanish this year will be hard, and mrs.barrentine was not a good teacher.  oh well.  
my school seems awesome though.  they have a nice, nice theatre.  and they are putting on the sound of music in the fall!  yay! 
man, i was going to write something, but i dont remember what it was....
i hate when this happens...
well it is 9:16 pm here, 8:16 am your time, and i must go,
miss u!

"event","Hey everyone, or should i say, ni hao from Beijing!
 
It is about 5:16 PM here, 4:16 AM your time.  We got here last night (may 31st) but were an hour late because of bad Chinese weather.  First class was AWESOME.  I watched, in this order, Finding Neverland, Phantom of the Opera, the Spongebob Squarepants movie (w/e), About a Boy, and Phantom of the Opera.  I officially love the Phantom.  If I was Christine, I definately would have fallen for him.  Despite the slight deformity, he is quite attractive.  More about that later, Derek is reading over my shoulder. Oh wait, technically, he is UNDER my shoulder.  Ok.  We are on the 28th floor in room 2808.  We have put everything away and even went to a grocery store.  The only bad thing about the grocery store is that the DVDs were in Chinese, and we accidently bought tomato ketchup bugles instead of the original flavor.  Right now, we are watching British rugby, and later, we will explore the mall in the basement.  
Well, Derek is dying to watch the Sandlot 2 on this laptop, so bye for now.
Xie Jian! (bye)
Heather"

"event","okay, since heather has left us to go to china for a year i decided to make this for her...

if she sends you any emails or you find something that reminds you of her that you would like to post here just tell me and i will either post it for you or give you the password(but only if you are like jodie or skye or marly...)

I'll update it more in a minute...also, it jodie wants to help me with the layout that would be cool...

also, if an email is posted and you aren't exactly sure what heather is talking about, email me and i'll see what i can do to make it make sense...it probably doesn't make sense because she is replying to the original email someone sent her...(do i make sense?)"

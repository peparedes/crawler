<TD align=middle><FONT size=5><B>Smartass</B></FONT><BR>You are 71% Rational, 85% Extroverted, 71% Brutal, and 57% Arrogant. </TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>You are the Smartass! You are rational, extroverted, brutal, and arrogant. You probably consider people who are emotional and gentle to be big pussies who are obviously in lesser stature than you. You have many flaws, despite your seeming intelligence and cool-headedness. For instance, you aren't very nice. In fact, you're probably an asshole. And you are conceited and self-centered. Not only that, but you are very loud and vocal about all this, seeing as how you are extroverted. There is no better way to describe you than as a ""smartass"", I'm afraid. Perhaps just ""ass"" would do, too. But that's a little less literary and descriptive. At any rate, your main personality defect is the fact that you are self-centered, mean, uncaring, and brutally logical. 
<P>
<P><B>To put it less negatively:</B> 
<P><I>1. You are more RATIONAL than intuitive. 
<P>2. You are more EXTROVERTED than introverted. 
<P>3. You are more BRUTAL than gentle. 
<P>4. You are more ARROGANT than humble.</I>

<P>Other personalities you would probably get along with are the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=100&score2=100&score3=0"">Capitalist Pig</A>, the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=100&score2=0&score3=100"">Braggart</A>, and the <A href=""http://www.okcupid.com/tests/describescore?testid=4741219933576750506&score0=100&score1=0&score2=100&score3=100"">Sociopath</A>. 
<P>* 
<P>* 
<P><I>If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an extrovert to be classified that way as well. Below is a list of the other personality types so that you can determine which other possible categories you may fill if you scored near fifty percent for certain traits.</I>

"event","the past couple weeks have been pretty good.

i got a job at wal mart in dunnellon doing overnight stock. it's pretty tight. they started me at 7 an hour, with 40 hours every week. and a lot of benefits. I think most people would hate working 10pm-7am but time flies and it works perfectly for me. im totally a night person anyyway and i get bored in the day.

anyway, i worked fri, sat, sun, mon, tues, and i was supposed tow ork til a couple hours from now but they fucked up and i had too many hours for the week. anyhow i got off early, right after finding out that i got a dollar raise andn now make 8. that's fucking awesome. and i'll get a .50 raise in a month or two. maybe a merit raise too.

AND, my birthday is the 26th. im gonna be twenty. this is an open invitation to anyone whor eads this...im having a party at some point and you're all invited.

other good news, i get paid in the morning. only like 100 bucks, but its all from orientation. awesome

AND i have the enxt two nights off.

anne marie, if you're in cc, you ARE coming to hang out with meon my birthday. goddamnit. havent seen you in wayyyy too long and you;'re one of my favorite people.

tomorrow im going to sleep til about noon i think. get up, go get my check, make a few stops at ppls houses for business.

god i can't wait til my first real paycheck. i figure im looking at about 500-600 on it. would be 7 if the goddamn government was robbing me legally.

that's it. im oging to bed. i got a productive day ahead of me tomorrow hopefully."

"event","so icame into the county last night and come home to my empty parents house. i sit around for a while figuring they went to eat at stumpknockers like they usually do. dad comes home around 9:30...I ask him ""where have you guys been?""
dad - ""I've been at work""
me - ""Where's mom at?""
dad - ""uhh, she's at a male review""
me - ""huh? what's that?""
dad - *pause* *laugh* ""male strippers""
me - my moms at a strip club? sorry if that's a little suprising

then my mom calls me like two hours later tellling me shes on the way home and to make her food. i told her no cause she never cooks me food when i come home drunk

basically i guess the point is how shockingly my parents have changed, atleast my mom, in the year or two i've been gone.

wow

"event","so i think somewhere in my mind i have something to say. like a commentary or something

i like how women are all pro-equality, but only about the things that benefit them. if we're equal, and you should get apid as much as, and treated the same as a man of equal intelligence, why the fuck does the man always get arrested in a domestic call, regardless of the situation. ""yeah, we're equal, but its DIFFERENT if you hit us""

now, i would never hit a girl, barring extreme circumstances of life and death, but what the fuck. shut up talking dumb shit. just because  a long time ago you couldnt vote and were considered housewives, doesn't mean you should get any kind of reparations or special treatment. im all for equal rights, but lets make it all across the board. hitting a girl shouold be the same as hitting a guy if we're equal. 

besides that, it's almost to the point where the scale is tipped. even a girl who was only half way decent looking will get a job nowadays before a man of the same background. okay, we can't use our god given advantages, but they can. women of the world: this is a harsh fact, bu tmost women are sluts. most girls will show some tits to get them (or get them out of in some situations) anything.

so the next time you see YOUR woman, smach her around a little bit for being a stupid whore, then proceed to tell her the next time she hits YOU, you're going to stick a lead pipe in her ass"

"event","I've never been played by a ho!
If the bitch is acting stupid, 
She's got to go!
Some mutherfuckers [missadden']
If she fucks with me, I'ma kick her little monkey ass!
See you hoes got it wrong!
Think that if some Nigga says he loves you he ain't strong.
Girl you taking shit the wrong way.
And I can tell right now. It's gonna be a long day!
I got to educate you brothers
If the bitch won't give up the plate 
then fuck her!
Move along to the next trick.
See I'm teh type of guy who tells a girl 
""suck dick!""
And if she ain't suckin'
That's a waste of time
conversation and my fuckin'
I'll just put my fuckin pants on
And tell the idiotic freak
to take her tramp ass home!

You see I don't need a dumbie!
I need a bitch to like nuts
until my dick is coming
And after this she'll earn her glow
Just call me the gangster of love.


I like bitches
All kinds of bitches,

To take off my shirt 
and pull down my britches
If she has big tities 
I'll squeeze them and hold'em 
As she sucks my dick and licks my scrotum
If she's got another friend then I'll fuck her too
Together we can play a game of swi-cha-ru
I ain't the type who gets all mushy
I like to sit back 
and watch them eat each other's pussy!
Weak people might say I'm insane
But that's the other damn love of the game
I'll turn your sister out if you fuck with me
You want to know my name???


Bitches look at me like I'm a faker
Knowiung goddamn well
I'm a mutherfuckin heartbreaker!
I'll have them crying for months
Cause I done fucked their best friends 
and put a whipping on their cunts
They have their mothers to call
But if you don't fucked one mom
Then you done fucked them all
And I really don't give a fuck
Cause if your mother give up the pussy 
she's fucked
And I really don't give a fuck
A pussy fuckin' gangster!
goddamn!
Six different hoes a night
I use lubricated rubbers
To make the pussy feel right
Better to be safe than be a vicitm
I put the pussy in its place
Before I nut 
I pull it out into the face
And tell the bitch to keep licking
And prepare herself for another ruthless dicking
And when I'm done--straight to the tub
Just call me the gangster of love.




I'm a mutherfucker
I put a bitch through a test. 
If she don't pass, she don't get blessed!
If the test consist of 
fuckin my whole crew
Bitch, goddamnit that's what you gotta do.
You say you want to be down with Willie-D
But yet you find it difficult to listen to me
Everytime you fuck up and miss a class
I'ma put my goddamn foot in your ass
ANd if your father wants to buck up
I'll beat the wrinkles out the old mutherfucker
I'll treat a bitch like a queen, 
But she's got to realize that I'm the goddamn king
Some jealous punk in town
Told my girl I was fucking around and she's still down.
To do the same 
Yo've got to have game
You want to know my name???

[side]
say ak
you what's up Dee
All the hoes mad 'cause we ain't paying for the pussy fighting over their asses
and shit! Yup that's that other level of the game again.
Damn straight!
While we on the subject of hoes, whatever happened to the hoe you used to fuck
named Cathy???

[song again...]
Ok Cathy
That hoe was hot.
The first peace of pussy that I ever got!
She fucked me till I was coming
Put her nuts in my mouth 
and started humming
I said shit comense the checking
She started scratching my dill-bag 
and said hold up a second.
Turned me over on my back.
Opened up my butt cheecks 
and started licking up my asshole
That's why I guess that I'm the gangster
And Kathleen Johnson sweetheart
I'd like to thank you
Little hoes out there are getting stuck,
by niggas like me and we really don't give a fuck!
Big-ass titties are the sexy switch
Whatever you get, you deserved it bitch!


See ummm,
I like to take'em st.
Pretend I lovem
and dog their motherfuckin ass.
Like for instance ms. ""p""
The bitch ran a game 
and tried to fuck over me
But I sensed it in the making
talking about she's pregnant
From me or that Jamaican???
She said me of course
So I drug her little ass
Like a mutherfuckin horse.
That's what you get for tryna play me
I'll kick the bitch 
right dead in the ass
If she ever says we 
made a kid when I make it
I'll grab her vile her mutherfuckin' neck
and try to break it!
Cause I knew I wore a fucking glove
You know who you fuckin with bitch???

you gotta hear this song...geto boys - gangsta of love

anyway

everyones in the trend of real updates so heres one

been working at the car wash in waterford lakes. it has its ups and down points, but theres a lot of things i like about working there.

wenat home over the weekend. hung out with kasey for a while and watched the super bowl, drank beer with her at my parents house. it was fun. i hung out with the mother too since my dad flew to nashville for some conference. THey just got new wood flooring in their house, and my mom has uncontrollable OCD about it. she's gonna be even crazier when she's senile.

I like how my mom bought me a twelve pack for the superbowl. and made some bomb ass chili.

usually i hate going home. but i get along a lo tbetter with my parents nowadays, and imeven cool with my sister. we went to pizza hut today after smoking a blunt of this shit i brought from orlando. and me and my sister are retarded when we smoke together, so it was funny.

have you ever cared about someone and felt like no matter what you did it wasnt good enough? its s ofunny

and lately i feel kinda more back to myself..more or less. Things are more or less falling into place, slowly but surely. It's kinda cool lately. I feel desensitized to everything around me. Like, almost like im adapting to ignore bullshit again. I used to be a stone cold pimp ;-) nah just kidding, but I just looked at things more black and white. If i didnt like someone, or if they caused me more troble than anything...whether i liked them or not - I could just cut them out. I think im about to tighten up my circle.
ha

any guys that are reading this. i need your attention. 
how many of you give a fuck about valentines day? is it not just a random ass holiday to spend money on your girlfriend/valentine? fuck valentines day. from a basic standpoint, it bullshit. guys should have their own valentines day equivalent holiday. So this year we need to set an arbitrary holiday called steak and blowjob day. someone told me about it a couple years ago and I thought it was a great idea, but i've never celebrated it. so, what do you guys think? or IS there an already established date that i don't know about? any input is good input.

im really lit.

tomorrow is going to be a good day

I don't think i really have anything more to say. so im gonna get on outta here. you guys take it easy. 

btw to my pal with the 2 inch penis...swing when you see me...call your friend or whatever...i'll bring my boy T-rav and break your fake gangster, blind in one eyed, asses apart. Everyone you think you're impressing with your entry level flippin, and fake gangster shit are starting to wonder how you see me so often, ususally with all your friends, talk and don't do anything. real men don't need to fight at all, but only a little faggot would feel the need to mass up on someone half their size. you're not shit, you have no future, and dont hate me because you got playedby a girl 6 years younger than you. talk is cheap."

I would venture to say that as of tuesday, my financial obligations will be taken care of for a while, and i'll still have some to put back. don't reall feel like elaborating there either.

if anyone just ever feels like they HAVE to get me a present, a pair of reeboks or some nike cross trainers always hits the spot. and they have 2 for 89 so you can get me double the presents. size 12, or if any sexy girls just wanna come by and kick it with me for a while, you know, entertain me with your wit and charm...that's fine to.

OR if any cute girls want to be my valentine this year, looks like im open for that. and it COULD get exciting. and as for that, im real easy to please. cook me a steak and im good to go.

right now im in CC unfortunately.I got in at like nine last night, and decided that I was gonna go to a party with svannah and kasey. got there and there was drama from the start, everyone wanting to fight over some dumb shit. some stupid kids were like following a friend of mine talking about fighting. I overheard it and just started talking shit to all of them. they backed off but started talking shit to me like twenty minutes later when they thought noone was around to get my back. well to make it short, there were four kids, and at least three out of the four got their asses kicked by one of my less-sane friends. it was just funny.fighting is so much fun around here.

today i didnt really dos hit.

im really excited for classes to start. i feel like i've matured to the point where college will just be easier this year. i got a nice girl im interested in, and other aspects are starting to fall in place. can't really elaborate.

went to Orlando on wednesday for a couple days. just to get out of here for a few days pretty much. I woulda stayed down there permanently but I have a driving class I have to take in CC this week, so that wouldn't have worked out very well.

I get the feeling orlando i sgoing to be a lot more fun this year. My friend shawn just moved to the same apartments as me. my roomates seem pretty cool, especially Lou. Plus I have a crush on his cousin whos more than likely gonna be living at our apartment :-) I think she likes me. we'll see.

mmmmm talked to cheryl last night. for the past few weeks me and her have been talking, but in kind of a stage like wtf are we gonna do when i go back to school. She doesn't really trust me all that much when I'm here, and I actually have been good lately. I pretty much told her last night that I don't think it's gonna work between her and I. Like, if she can't trust me in her own neighborhood, what is she gonna think when I'm in Orlando where there are 3 million girls i've never met before? not that girls are gonna like throw themselves at me or anything, but I really don't trust myself all that much. She's a nice girl. I guess as much as I like her, the thought of a relationship really isnt doing it for me. not a long distance one anyway. I hope she knows that it's me and not her, as corny as that sounds, because in all reality if I didnt live down in Orlando I'd be all about dating her. Buuuut I went through torment last year...absolute hell, for a girl that was here that I wasn't even dating. I have the feeling that even though I've matured a little bit since then, it would still kill me to work that all out. And god knows i don't need any kind of distractions this year. I definitely need to get my shit all back together.

I feel like I've changed a lot since last year. Some changes are good some not so good, but any change is progress in my eyes, so whatever. 

annnnnd I should have my license back very soon, which is totally awesome. blah. 

i'm so excited to go back to school. this year WILL be the shit, and I have the feeling that I need to go all out in order to straighten out the damage i've done this last year.

study hard, play hard, and keep it gangsta....of course.

"event","took the weekend off and went to daytona with the family minus the bitch. It was very relaxing and although it started off kinda slow, it endedup being good.

saturday was alright. I met these guys who were some douchebag pretty boy faggots. too stuck on themselves and they'd been there a few days and hadn't met any girls. I needed teh weekend to just have fun. i was shitfaced by like 3pm saturday with no worries. plus i met me some georgia peaches who were just really cool girls. and one was cute. 

last night  i went out with svannah and her crew and got shitty. shittier i guess i should say.

annnnnnnnnnd i'm sorry for the PMSing entries. I was just being gay. 

Nick - The crystal river guys...only know a few of their names. someone told me that i punched some cale trenary kid. and i knew a kid named ej gerrits. No need to talk to them. I have a feeling I'll hear about one of their parties soon and it'll be a different story if i show up with a few people. good times.

annnnnnnnd I'm totally feeling better and I think tonight will be a good night as well.

I have everything i need at this point...almost.soon it'll all be over.

anyone up for some casual sex? 

Just kidding"

last week has been fucked up. this whole summer has just been one big disappointment after another. If you knew my situation you'd probably laugh and think I was crazy, but whatever.

last saturday i went to a keg party in crystal river with two friends. ended up getting jumped by about 30 punkass rednecks. that's all im gonna say about that though. long story. 

I dont even know how to express my feelings. I'm just really sad today. Over something that i'll probably think is stupid in a month or so, but regardless.

I'm just tired of everything. People hurt me on a regular basis. I know that sound slike a bitch thing to say, but whatever. Guys are fags, and girls play too fucking much.

fuck it."

"event","last couple days have just been kinda shitty. I couldn't really name a particular reason, just a bunch of little things that take their toll after a while.

i'm really anxious about going back to Orlando. I'm excited but I just have to kind of avoid attachment to a certain person. which sucks because she makes me really happy. But I'm not sure I can handle that big of a distraction. It's going to be cool going back though.

I wish cheryl would just show up at my house. 

I wish I had a valium.

later"

"event","ya, so it's true.

i dunno, someone mentioned last night at jims that i dont ever update so i decided i would. i didnt drink tonight. friday night i drank so much liquor it was sick. woke up at like 8 to go to work still drunk. funny shit.

annnnnd saturday I couldn't even say what I did. I think I went out to jerrys.

last night went to jims with cheryl to meet up with the crew. It's always fun. got pretty shitty by the end of that night too. It ws nice seeing everyone bt like half the people there didn't even say two words to me. oh well. nick was very drunk I would say ;-)

definitely have been having an interesting summer. can't really go into details too much. but uhhh yeah. working everyday sucks kind of but atleast i'm being productive. eh and i still have fun after hours. not so bad i guess. wow i just spaced out for a minute.

lol i just read amys LJ. what's witht the quotes around girlfriend? I never said she was my girlfriend but i would like her to be very much.

and I think she might think I'm cute ;-)

i'm way too lit to really say anything more"

"event","well it's that time of day.

went out to big blue today with a couple of the guys. left the sluts behind :-)

I leearned how to do a backflip off the rope swing. on accident, but works either way

cheryl is coming home sunday, i'm quite excited about that...shoudl have the day off too, but either way...

tomorrow I have to go to some 2 hour class for reckless driving. shoulda seen it coming, but it wont be that bad.

i dont really have anything to say except.

I hope she loves me ;-)"

"event","hmmmm don't really know why im updating. i guess cause i have a lot on my mind right now and about 45 minutes til i have to leave for work.

work is going alright. I get paid today. only for like two days so it's gonna be like 70$ but its pocket change. and probably i'll just turn that in to like 150 with a little creativity. 

shit i forgot brandi's dad owes me 20$ today for mowing their lawn. that's cool too.

sooooo i decided that next weekend im more than likely gonna go to aftershock and get a tattoo. I wanna get one between my shoulders on my back, but i don't know if i can. if not tere i guess im gonna go with the chest. I talked to cheryl in PA last night. she really wants me to get my nips done but im not sure I wanna do that. not so much cause it would hurt putting them in, but its only a matter of time before those bitches get ripped out in a violent manner.

soooo the goddamn clerk of courts isnt open today and i just found out i still have a fine to pay before the license renewal can happen. even still, shouldn't be more than a week now. I didn't know this but aparently the parents told me a while ago that they would pay the fine. then i just gotta do a little work to the car cause it's been sitting for so long. probably just a new starter and some hoses and belts. I'm pretty sure I can get it all done cheaply. If anything Lowell will let me work at his shop to work off some of it. even if its not discounted it shouldnt be tha texpensive. meh. gotta tag that bitch too.

im really not too keen on this whole cheryl being gone thing. I miss her. that's really not a good sign. this is what always happens to me. I get into a state of mind where im indifferent one way or the other about girls and my situation with them. then i kinda just wanna have fun and play the field a little bit...not be slutty, but just explore different possibilities. then some girl comes along and I start to like her, etc etc.

I should just preempt the whole thing and shoot myself in the face.

man i really hope i don't have to slice onions today. it gets so bad that EVERYONE at work complains there eyes are burning. but in all fairness, I am a slicing dicing machine.

sooooooooooo does anyone read my journal? what i guess im getting at is anyone home for the summer, or temporarily that wants to hang out? probably not.

shit i better go shower and shave. working on hittin all the bitches at work. nah just kidding. 

i love annemarie and svannah miller <3"

"event","shit i have work in an hour. started yesterday at the pizza pub. i pretty much just do prep work, bus tables, and dishes. about an hour into lunch rush the owner came up to me and said she was giving me a raise cause im a bad bitch ;-)don't think i've eveer gotten a raise on my first day of work. it's awesome.

today i've got 11-2:30 and 5-9 so that's 7-8 more hours to add to my paycheck.

i really like this job. im gonna get a tattoo done with my first paycheck i think. i might wait for cheryl to get back from PA though. I think she wants to go with me.

cheryl is fucking awesome but she's gonna be gone for another week and a half and there is so much temptation. but im doing good so far. and working will help me to stay out of bad situations.

i go for the most random girls lol

not really anything to say. i need to go back to orlando soon for a day just to pick up my cell and some clothes cause i dont have shit right now. blah.

im gonna go shit and smoke my black and mild. im workin on the no cigarette thing."

"event","I am keeping my vacation mood even though I had to return to normal duties today.  Doug and I were up about six this morning to get to church for 6:45am.  He was running sound and I facilitated the services- which means I gave cues, ran errands, and conveyed requests between the singers, technical team, and pastors.  The service ran really smoothly today without many hiccups :)  We got home by 1pm for brunch.  

I told Doug I wanted to go shopping for the weddings since we haven't done that for any of the four I mentioned in an earlier entry.  So I thought we'd go to Hickory to hit the mall, Bed, Bath, & Beyond, Sam's, and Verizon.  I think he really didn't want to go because instead we looked everyone's wish lists online and decided what to get them from there.  I guess I probably wouldn't have done too well even if we had gone.  Lack of sleep tends to hit me hard so I'm dragging.

Clinical Practicum ended last Wednesday, so I don't have any early mornings this week unless I decide.  I am so excited and I have time to do stuff around the apartment that has needed to be done for several weeks.  Yeah! now I can let my inner neat freak out!  JUST KIDDING- I can't be insanely neat even when I do try.  I only have a few other things that are due and a ""laid back"" final exam in nurogenic disorders.  By laid back my professor means that it will be mostly multiple choice and that we will all be brining snacks & drinks for the time we're taking the exam.  I doubt it will be EASY since he write tough tests and requires the students to really synthesize information that he gives us.  However I seem to learn alot from him and I am hoping that indicates that I'll do well.  

I hear Doug making noises in the kitchen so I'm going to see if he needs help.  Hope that crash wasn't serious!"

"event","The beach vacation over the past several days was worth the work to get there!  We FINALLY left to head to Ocean Isle around 9pm and after storms and a detour through ghetto Whitehall we made it.  Thursday Doug, Sara, & Katie were lazy and didn't bother going to the beach.  I did go with Sue and Jay for several hours.  We mostly swam/floated/boogie boarded, and were sitting on the beach when it started getting cooler.  As we packed up it started raining which confirmed the good timing to head for shelter.  

Friday it was nicer and the sun was out for more of the afternoon.  All six of the ""houseguests"" went to the beach about 1pm.  The current was strong so we ended up swimming hard to stay near our spot on the beach.  The waves were also really big and Katie got knocked over several times when they broke on her.  The guys thoroughly enjoyed the boogie boards, but the girls mostly floated around.  Stephen arrived early in the day and was hanging out alone until Phillip told him we were there so he came to hang out on the beach with us for a couple hours.

Phillip arrived with his new Audi S4 (and he is sooo proud)and met my in-laws.  They were exchanging greetings when I picked up the keys to the car and said ""Hey Phillip, I'll see you in about ten minutes!""  I expected him to flip out about it since I was taking the new ""baby"" but he said ""sure"".  Stephen came with me and we found a straight road with no traffic tested the car out.  I swear it felt like I was hardly moving when I hit 80mph.  It shifted smoothly and the turbo pushed you into your seat when it kicked in.  The car also had a really quiet cab.  I think I could definately see myself driving one....of course the $$$$ isn't in the near future, so I must satisfy myself with day dreams.

Friday night the ski crowd arrived at Phillip's so Doug and I hung out there.  Doug wasn't feeling great so we didn't attend the saturday wedding in Raleigh but stayed and relaxed at the beach instead.  We took trips out to the sandbars for the girls to collect shells and the guys to torture marine life. I spotted a large blue crab-which was feeling dormant, Doug caught a minnow that Phillip supposed to be a Barracuda minnow due to its markings, and the other guys spotted a sting ray when it lept out of the water while feeding. The guys wanted to drive around in the BIG boat so we took it out on the ocean for a scenic ride and fishing.  The fish didn't bite, but we weren't there for very long either.  We decided to tour the intercostal waterway to catch some sun rays on the boat and the two of the girls laid out on the bow & platform on the boat while the guys chit chatted about cars, girls, and who knows what else.  Then on the way home Phillip forgot that there was still a single rod with a line out and gunned the boat- which resulted in an interesting show when the line bounced everywhere and a broken line.  oh well :)

The end of the day was the drive back to Boone to return to ""normalcy"" but my three days of bliss was well worth it!"

"event","I AM SICK of school, I may have mentioned that previously- but I REALLY AM!
     I have this AWFUL project due for one of my classes tomorrow and it sucks.  I have worked hard on it so far and it feels like it is miles away from being completed.  If the directions were clear it might be simpler, but the project is a cumulative deal that is almost as complex as a thesis.  Ok that might be exaggeration but it feels that way.

Whew! Glad to get that out there.  I really do enjoy being in graduate school for the hands on part of the learning, but they do pile the work onto us.  I only have a couple more days of required practicum and a week and half of classes left plus exams.  I definately like normal semesters over the summers. 

No other thoughts for tonight since my brain is squeezed out into the project."

"event","Turns out that several of my friends and family got into keeping journals online.  I have found that it is a great way to keep up with what they are doing and what is up, along with a few random thoughts.  I intend to write some but I make no promises as to how often I will update.

On Weddings:  Four weekends straight of weddings started with a really sweet one last night.  Two of Doug's high school friends got married.  They adore each other and it is evident.  The Bride was crying as she walked down the aisle and it was awesome to watch them through the cerimony.  One thing that was different than other weddings I have been to was that the parents of both the bride and groom laid hands on the couple at the begining and prayed over them.  I thought it was special to have the families dedicate them for their life together.  We enjoyed seeing so many of Doug's friends and updating them on us.  We were the first of our friends to be married and now at each turn another is married.  It is a joy to watch our friends meet and marry the right person.  I wonder who will be next?

Next week a bunch of projects are due for school and clinical practicum ends.  I am SO excited that this semester is finally winding down.  Next Weekend we get to go down to Ocean Isle to spend a short couple of days with Doug's family and then attend a wedding in Raleigh.  I can't WAIT to be at the beach again.  My family never went when I was growing up, but I am quickly falling in love with beach vacations.  Then in another couple of weeks Doug and I get to go visit Phillip and a few other friends at Phillip's house.  I love breaks from school!  

That's it for tonight.  Off to dream of sweet things."

"event","D: Ugh, I'm exhausted. What a year its been.&nbsp; Goodbye 2009, you will definitely not be missed.&nbsp; Overall it was not such a great year, but I can definitely say it forced me to grow up a lot and not be quite so innocent about the ways of the world.&nbsp; A lesson Harley learned when he lived in Japan on his own for a year, but I&nbsp;guess it was my time to learn that as well.

Back to work on Monday, bleh.

I'll try to get some photos up of the Christmas presents. Got a few Takahashi related things that came a few days late.&nbsp; Lots of PS3 games and clothes to boot!

2010, you can not possibly be worse than 2009.

Happy New Year everyone!"

"event","D: Posting up a pic of the newest stuff we ordered from Yahoo! Japan auctions. This turned out to be a really, really nice batch of Takahashi goodness. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Details and a pic of the whole she-bang after the cut""><br /><br /><img alt=""Shonen Sunday"" src=""http://i415.photobucket.com/albums/pp234/rumicworld/sunday/sundaysmar09.jpg"" /> <br /><br />Soooo much good stuff this time. First of all not everything is Shonen Sunday, the little square thing on the right end of the top row is a really, really rare piece of merchandise from right around 1993. Its a tryptic featuring Marin, a character Takahashi was hired to create for Japan's JR rail line. Its got little wooden ticket replicas on the center panel and you could get them stamped if you'd written that particular part of the line. Its a really neat item in and of itself, even without all the original Takahashi artwork. <br /><br />Right under that are two Big Comic Originals with color pages for &quot;In Lieu of Thanks&quot; (1998) and Birds of Fate (2009, finally got here...) I think we've got all of the color pages for all of her short stories but two now. <br /><br />And then the Sunday's! Five with Ranma 1/2 in 'em and one with Inuyasha. All have color chapters! Even better two of the issues are the very first chapters of Ranma and Inuyasha. So cool to finally own those. I really, really love collecting these old weeklies. Its like having a time capsule seeing all the advertisements for movies, what different mangaka were up to at the time, all that good stuff. <br /><br />Oh and the Quarterly S interview with Takahashi and the final volume of Inuyasha are in there as well. An awesome haul! <br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

"event","Argh, on vacation with no internet means we're unable to follow all the discussions and news about Shonen Sunday's 50th Anniversary issue. Sasuga wouldn't accept our special order early and then SOLD OUT of the issue when we contacted them the night before it went on sale....I might be done with them after that...

But our good friend in Japan picked up the issue for us and mailed it in. Apparently the ""It's a Rumic World"" DVD preview is for a contest.  Better believe we'll be entering for one of the 500 copies. *lol* Such a good shot of winning!!

Very excited about the ""My Sweet Sunday""....saw some scans.  This is why we love this magazine and manga in general.  Harley translated as we read through it, very cool.

More to come later."

"event","D: I was talking about it with Harley the other night (he's started getting caught up on Detective Conan/Case Closed) and were talking about the Locked Room mysteries that Aoyama does.  Basically these are cases in which a dead body is found inside a room that can only be unlocked from the inside, thus creating the appearance of a suicide.  Of course its always a murder rather than suicide, but the fun is figuring out how the killer did it.

The first time Aoyama did a locked room murder I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Then I was a little surprised when he did it again a few volumes later.  Cut to the newest Viz volume (24 I think) and he's done it like five times already.  So its not really special anymore, and its got me wondering how many times he'll use it again between now and the newest Japanese release (60-something). 

Random, I know."

"event","D: So I bought Vertical's release of Blackjack volume 1.  Very excited that this series is going to get a full release in the US I might add.  Of course when I say full release, you'd think I meant EVERY chapter of BJ that was published, right? But nooooooo!  The first volume omits ""The Two Jans"" chapter! If you want that you have to buy the deluxe hardcover edition! WTF!? I'm already paying $17 bucks for this book, give me the ""bonus"" chapter!

Additionally, after waiting since March, Shonen Sunday finally announced their first team up game with Shonen Magazine.  And its going to be a baseball game.....for the DS. *groans* I don't own a DS, but I would honestly consider buying the game and playing it on Star's, but a baseball game? Of course its chock full of characters from both magazine's baseball series, which is understandable, but then its got non-baseball characters like Conan and Hayate in it, no mention of ANY Takahashi characters though.  I think some other games are slated to be released though.....I really want a fighting game ala Jump All Stars....for a Playstation system please!"

On the other hand just got three ancient Shonen Sundays and one Young Sunday in the mail (two from 1982 and one from 1985, YS from 93) with our first sets of Urusei Yatsura color pages.  Collecting old Sundays hardcore since 2001, and we just NOW get the first UY pages, that shows how hard it is to find these things.

Takahashi, get back to work!"

"event","Harley: This has me pretty psyched, even more so than the new IY anime. I get probably at least 6 emails a week reguarly asking about when/if new Ranma episode were coming, and the fact that it's been 12 years since anything was made in Japan, I honestly believed there was next to no chance of anymore Ranma anime.

Well, surprisingly, I was wrong. They're going to do an adaptation of the ""Insense of Spring Sleep"" story from volume 34. Shonen Sunday said the ""cast and crew of Ranma and Inuyasha"" got together to make these, but with the complications of Kitty Animation, I don't know if the old crew behind Ranma really did this or not (until I see some footage). I know Junji Nishimura worked on an episode of Takahashi Anthology, so maybe he was involved, and I suppose they could have reused Atsuko Nakajima's character designs. Who knows, but I'm thrilled they did it, regardless of who is involved.

I have to wonder if Viz will pick this up. Marketing a 30 minute release would be tough, but I suppose they could put it out with the new 30 minute Inuyasha episode. I just hope they are able to get the old dub actors back for it!"

"event","<a href=""http://www.furinkan.com/features/articles/shonensunday50.html"">This is sooooooo awesome</a> that Harley and I have spent the entire day writing, translating, and editing images to try to get something up as quickly as we could.  As a manga fan, I'm excited that I get to be along for the ride on this, but as a Rumiko Takahashi fan I'm even more excited.

But for now, its 2:44 in the morning. We've been coding all day, we're exhausted, and it looks like this is just the beginning of the ""festivities"" that Shogakukan and Kodansha have planned. Add to that that Inuyasha's ending soon, and who has time for a real job with all the stuff we'll have to do to <a href=""http://www.furinkan.com"">Rumic World</a>......right? *lol*"

"event","Dylan:  Alright, so Harley and I are both unofficially done with graduate school now.  We'll get our degrees in December, but all the classwork and thesis defenses are behind us (AWESOME!).  I'm back home in Mississippi, and happy to be here.  Texas was great, and I loved spending so much time with Star, but she's moved to Japan, and I was ready to get back home.

So today is our birthday!!!! 26, holy shit, we're on the other side of our 20's now, when did that happen?  Today we're waiting around on deliverymen all day.  New fridge just got here, a nice little stainless steel number, and sometime today our brand new 1080P, 61 inch HD TV is gonna get here!  Finally going to get to put our Playstation 3 to the ultimate test!

So life is very good right now, we'll have to find real jobs pretty soon, but in the meantime we're just enjoying being home and giving the website our full attention.  Speaking of which, we just re-did the entire <a href=""http://www.furinkan.com/iycompanion"">Inuyasha Companion</a> so please do check that out, we worked our asses off on it, and it marks the future of what the entirety of Rumic World is going to look like in the coming months.

More birthday shout outs to fellow Takahashi-philes, Toshifumi Yoshida and Kirby Morrow!"

"event","Dylan:  I just got back from seeing the best concert I've seen in my entire life. The Police! My all time favorite band! One of my goals in life has been to see Sting in concert, but I never thought I'd be lucky enough to see the Police together.

They did all their most famous songs, Message in a Bottle, Invisible Sun, King of Pain, Dedoodoodoo Dedaadaadaa, Every Breath You Take. And did lots of stuff that I love that doesn't get played on the radio like Driven to Tears, The Bed's Too Big Without You, and two of my all time favorites, When the World is Running Down You Make the Best of What's Still Around and Can't Stand Losing You.

If they come to your city, GO SEE THEM! I know its really hard to get tickets, and their expensive to boot. But this band is legendary, and the show was so so so so so awesome! 

In other news, I found out that I passed my Psych GRE about a month ago, which put me in a frenzied rush to study for the ever so difficult Comprehensive Exam that all Graduate students must pass in their field in order to graduate.  I took it and was sort of assuming the worst because my department has had a 50% pass/fail rate the past two years on comps.  Thankfully I passed! I feel pretty great about things now, and all the remains is to defend my thesis in about two or three weeks and I'll be done!"

"event","Dylan: Santa was very good to us this year.  We loaded up on Takahashi goodness, we got TWO Big Comic Spirits with the original Maison Ikkoku color pages, a Shonen Sunday with red tinted Urusei Yatsura pages, a novel Takahashi did a few drawings for that we already had most of, a mystery mag that Takahashi drew some new MI pages for, a real hidden treaure; a children's book that Takahashi illustrated!!  Its the cutest story about an elephant that gets captured by this fat white guy and is forced to work until his elephant family comes to rescue him.

Harley also got me a really nice (and expensive) Maison Ikkoku artbook, and I got him two boxsets of Miami Vice and Final Fantasy XII.

Annnnnnnnnnd, *trumpets blaring* We got a Playstation 3!!!!!!!!  To all the naysayers.......its awesome, the graphics on Madden are gorgeous, it plays Final Fantasy with no problem, it hasn't overheated yet. Its a fantastic little system.

And in other happy holiday news, Rumiko Takahashi has wrapped up One Pound Gospel after 20 years of sporadic publication.  I was very skeptical that she could resolve everything that she'd been building to in only five chapters, and as I got each chapter and Harley translated them, I was even more skeptical, but she really turned it into a tearjerker in the end.  It was a really great ending.

So I'm happy to be home, surrounded by lots of great new things to update the site with, see my family and just relax away from school."

"event","Dylan: It's been a busy semester. I've got one more class meeting and then a thesis meeting next week before its officially over, but I just got out of a job interview that I'd been nervous about all week.  Next semester I'll (hopefully) be working at the campus counseling center as an unpaid intern.  

If I get on there I'll be handling an 8 to 10 patient caseload over the course of the semester as well as handling various paperwork and the like.  The people who interviewed me were extremely nice, but they asked the dreaded ""What are your weaknesses?"" question.  God I hate that, there's no good answer to it, and I can only hope that my answer didn't hurt me.

But who knows.  Finding a place to work is a requirement for graduation so I almost feel as though they HAVE to hire me, but I'm also not stupid enough to think that anything is guaranteed.

I'm ready to go home and have a nice Christmas with Harley, Chris and Star (who'll be coming with me!)

Ready to leave you behind Texas!!!"

"event","Harley: Yesterday I took the test to end all tests, my comprehensive Master's exam. There were twenty slide IDs which covered art and architecture from the Paleolithic period (approx 25,000,000 BC) to Post-Modernism in 2000 AD. 

Then we had three essay questions with an hour to answer each. They were pretty difficult, for instance one was ""Discuss the increased role identity has played in the art of the 1980s and 1990s, and cite relevant bibliography, past movements, and influential gallery showings."" 

I think I did well, I'll know officially next week, but if I did, that's the last think I need to do before I start writing my master's thesis. It's a huge relief to have this done though, that's for sure.

I even won two character singles I needed, which was very generous of Haro (who hosted the contest). I really enjoyed it.

Other than that, not too much going on. Getting ready to go home for Thanksgiving tomorrow which will be nice. I get to see Dylan for a week, and wait in line at the Wal-Mart for 12 hours hoping to get a Playstation 3 since I couldn't get a reserve... ugh. We did the same thing for the PS2 though. Guess I'll get some studying done.

I mowed the grass today. Very exciting stuff. I've also grown a professional quality goatee, which I need to trim into a more Count of Monte Cristo look. I heard from Harvard again recently and they are expressing an interest in publishing the papers from the conference if we can submit a 25 page version, so I'm trying to get 10 more pages ready. No guarantees, but if it works out I can say I've had something published. 

Catching up on my Maison Ikkoku viewing and finished up the second to last boxset of that. Poor Coach Mitaka, Kyoko did him wrong. He shelled out for a trip to Yokohama, booked the hotel and she still wouldn't sleep with him. Boo...

"event","Dylan: I got to go home to Mississippi for about two weeks, and I had a really great time.  The entire trip seemed to fly by though.  I was so happy to get to see Harley and Mom and Dad and Chris.  Unfortunately its over now and I'm stuck back in crappy Huntsville, Texas with my thesis hanging over my head. *groans*

One of the best things about going home was that we managed to track down a pair of rare Young Sunday's with the two most recent (2001) chapters of One-Pound Gospel.  The chapters haven't been collected in Japan or the US, and haven't been summarized anywhere on the internet.  It was also great hauling back all the things that I've gotten over the semester while I've been out here in Texas and Harley bringing in all his stuff that he's ordered.  Our Takahashi collection has been huge for a long time now, but we always seem to manage to find some neat, old product.  More color pages this time around too, Ranma's ice skating chapter and the first of the new OPG chapters.

We got a lot done on the website as well.  We're planning some new projects, writing some articles, maybe show off some things from our collection, and hopefully encourage other people from the board or just fans of the site to write some things that they'd like to see discussed.

The drive back to Houston was tiring. No air conditioner in my car either.  I'm happy to see Star again, but frustrated that we'll probably see less of one another during the summer than we did last semester....

"event","Dylan: Well the acquisitions at Rumic World continue.  Harley and I have been on a buying spree lately (can't really afford it, but what's a few missed meals when compared to Rumiko Takahashi products?) I've been spending a nice chunk of change picking up the imported Inuyasha statues these past few weeks, along with the seventh Maison Ikkoku boxset and the VERY cool 12 inch Inuyasha figure/doll. I highly recommend getting him, if you're a fan of Inuyasha, even though $35 bucks is a bit high.

Meanwhile, Harley's been doing some importing himself. He picked up the 25th Anniversary issue of Shonen Sunday, which has one of my all time favorite Takahashi drawings on the cover, as well as color pages for the first chapter of The Last Face from Mermaid and more color pages for the Battle Gi storyline for Ranma.  We've got some more things on order now that I'll wait to talk about until the arrive, but needless to say, we're REALLY excited. (Gotta pay an arm and a leg though).

School is almost out thankfully, but its going to be summer school for me....and beginning work on my thesis. *groans* Hating that."

"event","Harley: A month or so ago one of my teachers passed along a call for papers on ""Gender in Asia"" since she liked my Takarazuka paper. I sent off a proposal to Harvard, who is putting on the conference, and heard back a few weeks ago that my paper was accepted. I'm pretty psyched because the presentation is at Harvard, and the other people presenting are all from major league schools (Yale, Notre Dame, Cambridge, Oxford, UCLA, etc). I think I'm one of three people from a state school actually. So at the end of the month I'm off to Massachusetts to do it. 

Other than that my spring break is coming to an end and I've gotten less done on my final papers than I'd like. I've got a 20 pager on 19th Century Nude Paintings, and a 10 page one on more Takarazuka stuff in regards to feminist theory... Neeeee...

If anyone is looking for a good movie check out ""The Libertine"" or ""Inside Man"". Both are really good!"

The Toyota Center was packed, there were cops everywhere, lots of security and tons and tons of people.  The game was really great, although the crowd was really quiet throughout. I can't believe the first basketball game I've ever been to was an All-Star game! I got to see Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowinksi, Shaq, Tracy McGrady (who was awesome!), Yao Ming, Chauncey Billips, LeBron James (also awesome!) and lots of others.  It was really exciting, I had so much fun.  And there were tons of celebrities there too! Destiny's Child got back together to sing the national anthem, John Legend and Carrie Underwood performed at halftime, and we saw Jamie Foxx, Eva Longoria, Julianne Moore, Diddy, Jay-Z, George Bush Sr., and I heard that Bow Wow and Ciara were there too, but didn't see them.  Star and I did however walk right next to Ice Cube as we were leaving! He was literally two feet away, but he had his NWA face on rather than his ""Are We There Yet?"" face, so we could tell he didn't want to pose for photos or anything like that.  I had a great time, and really have to thank Star and her parents for letting me go."

She said her friend was going to go see Gackt in concert (I'm jealous!) Sarah gets to see Kiyoshi, Dylan gets to see Depeche Mode, and Kanye comes to BBham and I don't have the money to see him...

I know DM's music is good to commit suicide too, its so depressing, but their live show was just so full of energy and angst and passion, you'd have to be dead already not to really feel excited.

Its supposed to be a day that you've earned to rest, but no matter what age I am, I've always enjoyed about half the day, and when 2 or 3 o'clock rolls around, I start to get depressed and think about going back to school and starting the week ALL over again, and what a pain in the ass that is.  Starting from scratch, over and over.

The week went by so slowly on top of it all, and the weekend ust flew by. We were pretty busy at the Renaisance Fair on Saturday. Coming back to Huntsville tonight was so depressing. I realized how disconnected I feel out here. I stay in my apartment basically 22 hours a day, I only leave to go to class. This town doesn't have much to offer. A Wal-mart and a few burger joints. Thats why I look forward to seeing Star so much on the weekends. Its like I'm plugged in again, like I have my old life back. Being out here, I'm cut off from everything. No movie theaters, I don't drive so I don't listen to the radio, I have no idea what songs are getting played. I just feel out of the loop I guess.

Unfortunately now I don't have any family nearby to visit with or stay with, but I've felt very fortunate in the fact that Star and her family have been just unbelievable.  They let me come stay with them on the weekends and I feel quite comfortable there, something I don't feel during the week living by myself in Huntsville.

As luck would have it, two of my classes have been cancelled this week, and so I get an extra long weekend beginning tonight, which of course, I plan on spending with Star.

As great as Star is I have to admit to being terribly homesick. So much on the coast has been destroyed and Mom and Dad say they're happy that we aren't there to see it, but I can't help but feel like I should be there, helping in some way, even if it is just by spending time with the people I love.  Chris is still without power, which just makes me sick at my stomach three weeks after the hurricane hit.  Mississippi seems to be largely ignored by the news media, even though I think it was hit harder than New Orleans, which largely survived but is just....underwater.

"event","Harley: As if starting graduate school wasn't enough, our old stomping grounds are totally gone now. We're from very near Biloxi for those that don't know, and as I'm sure you all know there is very little left of the city. 

We were worried about our parents as we didn't hear from them for three days after Katrina hit. Because our house is a few miles inland and it's an underground home we never evacuate for hurricanes. In fact if school hadn't started when it did, Dylan and I would be there now. In a lot of ways I wish I was, so that I could help out. 

Luckily we were able to get in touch with my parents today. They were fine, but it took them two days to get the road to our house cleared. They had to do that and then drive around before they could find a decent mobile signal to call us. Thankfully they are okay. So is the house and all the cats. They're going to try to come up here (Gadsden, Alabama) since they don't have power there, but unfortunately there are almost no operational gas stations in the region so that could pose a problem. 

Couple all that stress with Dylan and I being on opposite sides of the South now and the pressures of starting graduate school and it hasn't been a terribly good week. 

Every place I ever hung out at is pretty much gone it seems. The clubs I visited in the casinos are demolished. The mall is totally gutted. A lot of my favorite restaurants too. Saying goodbye to leave for graduate school was a little bit more of a permanent goodbye I suppose."

Just returning from my visit to the Houston area, where I spent the week of the 4th with Star and her family and got some things squared away for my move to Huntsville.  I finally saw the school I'll be going to, and found it slightly odd.  The town is pretty run down looking, and my apartment seems sterile and dark, but at least its within walking distance of all my classes.  I'll just have to get used to being in a new place away from my true home of the MS gulf coast.  While I was gone, Harley took care of all his grad school stuff as well, he's moving to Birmingham for their Japanese art history program and it sounds like he'll have a comfortable set up as he's moving into our late grandparents house.  So even though the thought of school for ANOTHER two years is incredibly depressing, I did have an excellent time with Star. We played some board games (I'm awesome at Trivial Pursuit, who knew?) and set off $280 worth of fireworks that her Dad bought.  Star was even sweet enough to give Harley and I a plush Human Inuyasha doll for our upcoming birthday, and a pretty rare Movement 90 magazine with Ranma, Maison Ikkoku, and Urusei Yatsura in it.

The website.....let's see. Its been a bit of a slow week with us being out of town.  The new Inuyasha chapter is setting up another Moryomaru upgrade and a set of twin brothers was introduced, how appropriate!  Mermaid Forest got released on DVD this week, Harley and I checked out the first episode last night and we recommend it to all Takahashi fans.  Those of you who have watched the old Viz dub of Mermaid Scar a million times over the past 10+ years will have to get used to the new English voices of Yuta and Mana though. But they're good, so no worries there.

Oh and Hurricane Dennis is about to hit us!!"

At home we've been busy helping Dad move all his stuff from his studio's and getting them into storage here at home. He's retiring this year, which meant we had to get the house cleaned out first so that we'd have enough room to bring all the paintings and things he's done over 30 years to our house. Thats taken weeks, but is finally almost done.  On top of that we're getting new garage doors installed, and dealing with the rental property that Mom inherited in Alabama after Grandad passed away.

Busy online life as well. Harley and Mason and I re-worked Rumic World and the results have been great.  Lots of attention and positive comments, we're looking into reviewing some products for Viz too (crosses fingers) but we'll see how that goes.  I'm really thrilled with all the progress we've made over the years with the various sites, building them into a little ""empire"" of Takahashi goodness.

Okay, gotta pack, better get to it!"

We'd spent a week taking care of him just last week so we're definetely shocked. He was in bad shape, but I certainly didn't think he was near death.

We're leaving in about four hours to go to Alabama and get the funeral preparations underway.  This all comes on top of my visit to Houston to see Star, which is on Thursday. I had to buy new plane tickets and just eat the others because of the cancellation fee. *sighs* 2005 is turning out to be a bit of a rough year so far."

Just a follow up to the medical school interview. Surprise, surprise I didn't get accepted! So there goes five years of incredibly difficult (and now totally unnecessary)classwork!  What will I do with a year's knowledge of Inorganic chemistry? a year's worth of Organic chemistry? How about that year of physics? And who can forget that year of upper level math? Oh what fun to have wasted all my time in those classes for absolutely nothing!

And now I don't even get to SAY I'm a pre med student anymore.  I sometimes wonder if I'll even get accepted into graduate school now."

I had my interview for medical school today. My Dad and I drove to Jackson, MS yesterday and spent the night since it was such an early morning interview. We stayed at a really nice hotel, Cabot Lodge, the bed was really uncomfortable though and the shower had no pressure, but everything else was nice about it.

The interview was actually three interviews, it was as rough a process as I expected. Sometimes I felt like they were trying to trick me, they wanted to know about my experience or lack there of, and what I'd been doing all last year. They seemed to understand the amount of time I spent with my grandfather and helping to take care of him, but I still think they found me lacking in some areas.

Jackson seemed.......okay.  Its not like Biloxi, very metropolitan. I'm glad I did it though, at least I can always say I interviewed at a medical school now, and I actually feel really good about going into graduate school if I have to. I think Clinical Psychology would be just as good as Psychiatry.

Now I'm going to kick back and relax for a loooooooooooooooong time!"

"event","Dylan- Christmas really feels like it's snuck up on me this year. I've spent the last week and a half with my girlfriend though.  It was just the best time. I really miss her a lot now though. Even though I'm with my family for Christmas, which I have been every year, it seems like she should be here too. We've already exchanged presents, so thats over with, no anxious anticipation to see what she got me or what I got her.  

Its just odd in that I waited months and months, knowing I'd see her for over a week in December, and now that its over I feel a bit aimless.  I wonder when we'll see each other again? We'll both be busy soon.

Speaking of busy, I ended up being granted an interview at one medical school.  Just one, out of the thirteen that I applied to.  Woo hoo....

Anyway, Merry Christmas everyone!"

Today I spent my time working on getting the word out on the petition I've started. Some people on the messageboard seemed supportive of the idea of trying to get the old Rumic World (Firetripper, Laughing Target, Maris the Supergal, Mermaid Forest) OAVs and Viz's old Mermaid Scar and One-Pound Gospel OAVs out on DVD.

Central Park Media lost the rights to the Rumic World stuff, so I'm petitioning Viz or Animeigo (since they are a little more responsive to fan demand on old series).

So if anyone reading this is interested, please check out:
http://www.furinkan.com/dvd

It's a long shot, but my brother did a good job of helping to get Maison Ikkoku out on DVD, so I certainly think there is a chance if I can get the word out."

I feel numb right now. John Kerry just conceded the election to George W. Bush. So many people worked so hard to get him elected, and I really believed it was going to happen.

And now we have four more years of Bush and his dangerous policies.  Iraq is failing, we've lost most of our European allies, Bush will now gain the ability to appoint three to four Supreme Court justices, which puts a woman's right to choose in danger of being repealed. The Patriot Act will be allowed to continue, enabling law enforcement to search citizens houses with less reason than ever before.

Bush says he won't reinstate the draft, but I take no solace in that. I love this country, but I won't sacrifice my life to serve in a war I don't believe in.

I'm afraid for America. I honestly don't think she can handle four more years of Republican leadership."

Mason was kind enough to send me some copies of his episodes of Touch, the early 1980s anime series by Mitsuru Adachi, and I've been enjoying watching an episode a day right after I wake up. It's really shocking to me that no one has licenesed his series here in the US (besides his short stories). His art style seems like it would go over well, and his stories are very much in the vein of Maison Ikkoku. Touch is nice because, from a personal point of view, it stars twins, and you don't see that very often in a series. Plus you get a lot of Takahashi voice actors... 

I miss those bygone days of Kitty Animation... I'm still trying to find out what happened to them...

I always thought Viz would pick up some of his series because of their affiliation with Shogakukan, but I guess not. Even in Japan Adachi seemed to get less than stellar treatment by Shonen Sunday (he never got the cover the whole year I lived in Japan, plus there were quite a few weeks when Katsu, his newest series didn't even run)."

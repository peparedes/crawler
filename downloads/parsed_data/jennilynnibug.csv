"event","Sorry that i have not written in a while. I have been pretty busy here lately with work,family,boyfriend,and friends. Well so much has happened in the past few days. . who would have ever known that things sometimes go the way they do for a reason! You know this may sound bad but sometimes i think that bad things happen for a reason.... weather it is to make you a stronger person or just to teach you a lesson that you may use later on in life. Well i guess i am done preaching for this time. So my life has been Great Me and Brandon are awsome... I could not have asked for a better person than him to have a relationship with! He is so good to me... For one he brings me stuff to eat up to work all the time... Now that might not seem like a very big deal to you, but in my eyes it is the little things that count!Well Here lately Me and Brandon have been hanging out with Kelli and Jacobii. And man there is always something going on when we all get together.... There is never a bored min. that is for sure!"

"event","Man life is great! Sometimes it goes to fast tho. I don't understand the moments that you want to cherish for a lifetime fly by, but the moments that are the worst they seem like they are never going to end.... Well there have been a lot of things that i have learned so far in life! And things that i have learned have came from both the good and the bad times in my life. If there was one thing that i would have wanted someone to tell me when i was just starting to find out how REAL life is..... is that NO matter what you do weather it is good or bad in your life you have to live with it and NO one else! There is no human on earth other than your self that will be able to recall all the memories you have made or are making. So based on your heart and the way you feel and your morals is the only thing that should make your decisions. And when it is all said and done and you look back on what you call the journey of your life there will be NO one there to answer the questions of your memories but yourself! So live for your life for you!"

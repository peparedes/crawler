The weather has been so warm!
My house is clean...
The kids were pretty good today.
I couldn't have asked for a better day!

I was making pizza for kevin and I tonight and had to turn it into calzones.... our bottom oven doesn't work (long story) and so I didn't think about the pizza pan not fitting in our top oven.... but i had a creative moment and was able to fix the problem.

Rusty was a good dog tonight.  He sniffed around the house and didn't chew too many of my things... it a lot of ways kevin and I are learning a lot about ourselves as parents!

MaryKay has been going well... I was thinking about how i've made some great progress in my buisness and how much I love the way it works on my skin.  I use to be so concerned about my acne.. it use to just bring me down so much.. and I'm just thankful!  (i have a really cool website if you ever want to check it out!!  :)  www.marykay.com/joannacrabtree )

I'm at the library now and i'm going to do some email and work on lessons for tomorrow.  My sisters surgery went well and it ends up that she won't be in a cast after all but a walking splint....  Praise God!"

"event","It has been a long time since I have been here.  I received an email from a friend of mine.... which made me remember how important this place had been to me six years ago.  For those of you who remember me, I deleted my old journal because I wanted to start over.  A lot has changed in the last six years.  I have changed - - and while I do not want to forget my past, I no longer want it to hinder who I am today and who I will become tomorrow.  Maybe someday those hard moments won't be so hard for me to remember, but at this point in my life I no longer want to dwell or be reminded of past actions or things, but dwell upon the stability and blessings my life has.  

Kevin and I got married May 8th 2004.  We have been married for almost two years!  I never thought marriage would be such a blessing in my life, but it has.  He is a wonderful man who treats me with the utmost respect and love.  We bought a house last april and a dog!  We are both teachers - he teaches Math at an alternative high school and I am a special education teacher in a rural county about 20 miles from my house.  We are both pursing our masters degrees and should be done by next May.  

My mom moved to Kentucky almost two years ago - and while at first it felt different having her so close, it has been wonderful to be closer to family.  She is going back to school to pursue her bachelors degree in Ethics and Business.My twin sister is out in California and will be graduating this May with her Bachelors in Psychology.  

Right now I am putting together a power point presentation on poverty and how it effects education and our students today.  So I thought I'd take a quick break....

No babies on the way yet, however I cannot wait to begin a family.  Kevin and I are trying to hold off until our graduate degrees are done.  We would like to spend sometime together as a couple before the babies come - - although I do get the baby itch every once and awhile!"

"event","I'm kind of excited but then again not really. Back when I was younger I loved the 4th and in a way still do. It was fun to spend the day at grandma and grandpa's lake and see the parade and fireworks. For some reason, this year is going to be different and don't know why. Still excited to do all this fun stuff and kill the dog with walks and swimming but hey, its one huge summer party. celebrate the birth of our country and blow stuff up. 

When I was younger the forth was the halfway point in everything. The year was halfway over (In my young mind) summer was about to end, and it was fun to get out of the house and be around people again. Only had one bad forth but that was because it rained all day and we didn't get to do anything besides sit around and watch the rain fall and a tree knock over but we did everything on the 5th so wasn't too bad. 

I think the reason this year is going to be different is because of the fact that grandpa isn't going to be around. Been through this a few times before with other grandparents not being around on the 4th but for the last few years I did a lot with grandpa saying that this was going to be his last. I had more fun and did more things. We got a huge amount of fireworks this year and hope he hears it. I know his spirit is still around but still, in honor of grandpa, we hope to send him out with a huge bang."

"event","Yep, come and go, come and go. There really isn't much activity here anymore. Hate to get rid of this because when I first got it, it was fun and really liked it. Now its kind of dead and its a bit sad that this might not last any longer. I will give this site one more year before I close it up for good and walk away.

In other news. A few fun topics to talk about.

<b>Conventions</b>
There is a con coming up soon and I'm excited for it. I don't get to go to a lot of conventions because I have other things to take care of but now i'm starting a con jar. All pocket change goes into it and what ever else I feel like tossing in. This will only pay for fun random stuff for the most part but since I started this jar in may I already have about $57 in change ready to go. Normal savings is to help get there or cover some extra costs. I have set up a system for saving for things I need/want and so far its working out for me. 

<b>School again</b>
Because of recent events at work I have decided to go back to college. I have to give the school a call someday and thinking of doing it on the 7th. There is a grant floating around for all of this and need to see if I can get in, if I can it would be awesome because it will take a huge chunk out of what I have to pay for classes. I'm going to get entry level and start working there then work my way up to something better. I'm old but not too old to enjoy learning more about computers and keeping up with being a huge nerd. Granted its still not my dream job but hey, its going to pay for everything that I need. 

<b>Computer</b>
A while back I started doing 3D animation and spend a whole week learning how to do almost everything that I needed to learn how to do only to have the computer blow up and almost die. I'm going to start dicking around again just to keep up with how to make things but not going to go beyond basic meshes. My computer can't really handle that since its back down to 2gb of ram and a video card from 2009 (and that was only good for video editing.) I hope to get a new computer sometime in the fall once things are a bit more cleared up and take out a loan for it. But I have other things to take care of first

<b>Car</b>
My 02 civic has seen better days and last time I took it to the shop I was told that a lot of things needed to be fixed. I went into the shop and looked at things myself with tires off and checked things over with them and sure enough, it needs a little fixing up. I'm not going to go into full detail on what all needs to be replaced or fixed but all I can say is that its going to be a bit of work this summer and hope to get started on it soon. Front and back suspension need to be checked over and parts replaced or just refitted with new bushings. Shocks need to be replaced but knew that a long time ago but fear something else could be wrong with it and need to get it into a shop to check the frame since it has just under 200k miles on it and just want to make sure. Some things with the engine need to be done and hell, I'm kind of buying my dad's old car till I can get mine fixed so its not a huge rush or anything. 

<b>Life</b>
Yep last bit of info ready to be released. Its ok for the most part, as you can read I got a lot going on so going to be busy for a while, there has been a lack of overtime but soon it will pick up again. My wife left me a while back and the day after she left me my grandpa died so that was two major things, not only that we were getting ready for her to go into treatment for her problems. I have to spend a weekend sorting out everything that I can and put the rest into storage till I can get a place of my own and hope that I can get a place with some good friends next year. I know what is important and what needs to be done first and need to put things off to the side I can. Not going to skip the convention because after 3 years of hell with work and trying to get somewhere better then I am, I kind of need this. Computer can be pushed off and car maybe but school and convention are top of the list"

"event","To start I have already made plans for the tobacco part of everything. But won't be selling for a few years yet if I decide to keep growing. Just going to grow enough for cigs and a few Cigars. Another thing that needs to happen is that we need to find a place to live for 5 years and pay it off, maybe rent it out for about $250 ($500 if I include the lot rent at the trailer park)

During this 5 year stay I will be trying to keep going on 3D animation or some other kind of animation just for kicks. Also during this time I will be learning how to do other things and plot out a small farm, something to keep me busy but not a huge thing, make a small profit and keep things growing for retirement or something silly like that. The hobby farm will have tobacco, and sunflowers for sale and maybe a honey bee patch and see what kind of things I can make with honey bee stuff.

I might get somekind of livestock as well around the time I retire so I still have something to keep me busy but that is how I see things going after the next 5 years."

"event","It was today on the way to work that I kind of understood that I really hate the way things are going. The wife is living with friends, I stay at home and take care of the animals, and I sit around all day fearing the computer because the next keystroke could be the end of this thing. But on thing that really hit hardest for me was the fact that I miss messing around in blender. Now I could just go ahead and mess with it and just make random objects and other fun things but its not fun unless I can put the texture on it and be amazed at my own work. I have been kind of happy with the work that I did and had high hopes of being able to make better things by the end of the year, but here I sit with the fear of losing the second to last computer that I have because I burned out the CPU or something fine and dandy.

Its was a huge drag and stayed in my mind all day but it didn't effect my production at all. It got me going into other things that have been lacking in my life as of late like working on goals and seeing what I can learn if given time. But before I was able to punch in my friend and former co-worker and now co-worker again asked me how things where and went off on a mini rant about the computer problem. He laughed at me and said, ""We are looking for more people in the IT department, you should try and sign up"" I was shocked at this as working in IT would be a bit better for me as I was thinking of going back to school for this kind of thing again. 

But this was another thing that got on my mind, how I was going to try and get one of my friends that my wife is living with to work at the same place and quit her crap job at walmart. I want to take this job offer and hope that I can get in but don't know how we are going to get people to and from work if I take this job. I'm sure something will come up and we can work something out later on down the road. Until then, I will just see what happens. Try the job for a few weeks if I get it to see if I like it more then where I am now or just not get it at all."

Too sick to do anything and too tired to try but I have been up to no good working out how the diner is going to look. I might be able to get back into blender in a few days and make all the objects that I need. Nothing will be textured but set up and ready to go. I still have a goal of getting a new computer around June or July and should be able to show what I have been working on.

"event","By this nasty ass flu bug. Well it was more then just a flu, it was dehydration that set things off. On Friday I woke up and made my coffee and started working on random things in blender then went to SL. I was talking to someone when I got really sick and logged off and ran to the bathroom to throw up. My wife called work for me and I knew something wasn't right so we went to the ER. Yes, flu but we are going to stick this q-tip up your nose and poke your brain and do a flu test that normally gives off a negative reading because f*** you we are old fags and want to retire soon. So after that and an hour with IV and my god they were rough with that as well, she had to poke me three times to get in there. 

Ok, so lab results come back and yes, negative, so no tamiflu for you now f*** off and go be sick somewhere else. Sit at home sick all day. Temp is up and down all day highest it got on friday was 100.2. Saturday and nothing good came from that as well. Sat around sick watching TV (Cartoon Network and Science) and at about 6 my temp went up to 102.7, check it again a few mins later after sitting in a cold room with only my shirt and night pants on it didn't even drop, went up to 103.2. Back to the ER to talk to another doctor, tired and wanting to get to bed we wait and wait then he shows up to talk to me like a real doctor, asking better questions then the last doctor and thinking of running another test based on the fact that the temp didn't go down and I was coughing up all kinds of fun things. 

About an hour later I got more needles shoved into me for blood tests to see if there was something else there. This younger nurse did the blood work and one shot and less violent and better tape to hold down the cotton, I thanked her for being so gentle with a pussy like me. So another hour wait we find out that my blood work came back normal and all was good, Tamiflu and rest is all I need. Get home, take pill, go to bed and sleep thanks to mighty powers of NyQuill. The wife wakes me up and checks my temp 103.0 and she gets me out of bed and gets things to cool me down. it worked because about 10 mins later its 101.3. Back to bed and try to sleep.

Sunday, still sick but temp is 99.3 and wanted to leave the house, no go because the roads are ice because of Minnesota being a dick. I was still able to leave the house to take my wife to work and I stopped to get some pizza to try and eat because I didn't eat anything on friday saturday or sunday besides toast saturday morning. Pizza was good and stayed down but didn't have much of it. Got the wife and we went to walmart because my sister is now in the hospital about ready to have another screaming poop factory so we decided to get a card, a hat, and little booties. Well on the way home we get a message with a picture of the weird little red headed demon. So now we have to stop and say hi to him only i didn't go on because still kind of sick. Get home, and sleep. 

Monday feel better but going to take one more day off to just get rid of this headache and try to eat something. I'm going to try and do laundry right now because f*** being inside."

"event","I kind of don't want to talk about it but need to vent and maybe someone might find enjoyment from my pain and suffering. It started with me waking up and knowing that I have a lot to get done so already not too happy. Have to call insurance people and touch base with them and have them touch base with me and so on and so forth. after all of that its now about 9:30 and I have to start the truck and the wife's car.

Trying to start a car when its -24F (in the metric system its still f***ing cold) isn't going to happen. So now i have to hook up the battery charger and guess what kids, the plug has exposed wires in it and it shorts out and sends sparks everywhere because ground and another wire touched and now I have to reset the circuit breaker twice before giving up.

Anyway its now 10 and have to try and get the wife's car started. Same thing, won't start and have to hook up the battery charger because I know hers will start if it gets a bit more juice into the battery. Only thing is I can't open the hood because its that cold that the metal stuff won't move and I think I broke the lever thing inside the car because its F***ING -23F.

Ok whatever, wife isn't going to work today, i'm not going to work today because now the charger won't work at all and keeps shorting out the circuit so give up, go inside filled with bitter cold rage and broken extension cord because its -22 outside.

Its now 11 and things still need to be done, have to get insurance papers in, have to stop by the hospital, go to the bank, and go to work. Don't think anything is going to get done ever today. I check online and see what battery i have and sure enough the cold cranking amps is too low for it to even start on a nice day let alone get it to start on a -25F (wait, did it just go back down, F*** you Minnesota.)

its now 11:30 and my sister's boyfriend is fixing the charger as I relax a bit and try to cool my jets for a bit. 12 comes along and its all fixed, new cord on it and lets see if it starts after an hour... NOPE!!!! So far my list is.

-Bank
-Pharmacy
-Insurance
-Post office
-Hospital
-Auto parts store
and Work if I can make it there by 6

But yeah, the Truck needs about 600 amps to start, the battery on a good day is only 450 amps, so even on a good day, that truck won't start let alone on a cold day you have a better chance to warm it up by sitting on it and starting it then you have with a 5 hour charge."

"event","I was going to make a huge end of the year type thing but decided not to. I don't have the time to dig up everything that I need but I do remember quite a bit that happened. 

To start out, I got married to my girlfriend of 2 years. At this point we have been through everything together and thought that nothing was going to fuck us over. Well the whole thing went bad, it was snowing on both days and it was the wet heavy crap that will make you spin out. On the 5th of march we had our vows and on the 9th we had the reception that almost no one came to again because of the snow. We still had about 45 people show up out of the original 60. (We just wanted to keep it small and to family and really close friends.)

It was fun but our moms pissed us off a bit because we both didn't want to do the father daughter/mother son dance and we voiced this many times before the wedding but yet they still did it. The rest of the night was easy going. Talking to people and thinking about what im going to do with the car as I was one of the awesome (and only person) ones that lost control of the car and smashed the guard rail. We went to the hotel and invited some friends to shack up with us because of the weather. 

I didn't like this part too much because I just wanted to be with my wife and one other person to hang out. But we had to get others involved, (most of you know my standing on guys and how weird I am around them, it wasn't him it was me but still, just kind of off putting.) it was still a fun night regardless of person and someone that had a bit too much but all in all, it was still a fun night with the wife and others. 

We jump to summer now and it was ok for me but the wife got into some heavy drama that sent her over the edge. Shes been working at the old Super America gas station that I used to work at and things didn't go that great for her. Her manager should have never been a manager, I can tell you that much. I could go into more detail but no, not now. With all the stress of old friends saying things behind her back calling her out on stupid things, then her manager leaving a nasty note, I had to take her to the grace unit (its where we send people that tired to kill themselves or are a danger to themselves) where she had to sit for a few days. 

Once back she was told to go to another care center for her eating disorder that she got from all the slamming and other things that went and got to her. We were told that we could press charges but it was too late for that as the old friend had her facebook deactivated then later fired for having her facebook again, and the note that her boss left her was in the dump for the longest time so no longer care. She spent a week in the eating disorder clinic and they did what they said they were going to do but wish they did more besides watch her pee and make sure she had a clean plate. In a way, that was one of the biggest regrets of the year because they didn't do jack.

Fall and now, nothing really happened besides she got a job at target right before thanksgiving. We hope that shes able to stay there but fear that she might not. A stupid fear as all they have done is said good things about her and love her there but still, she might get kicked out for some dumb reason. And it was on this epic journey to work on new years eve that we got into a car accident. We are all good, she just has a sore neck but hope that it will get better. What happened was someone hit black ice and went on the curb and got stuck, a car stopped before hitting them, another car stopped, we stopped and someone from behind tried to stop but didn't and hit our car, the car in front of us, and I think they hit someone else. 

First responder stuff kicked in and checked to see if everyone was ok and told everyone to get to a parking lot where the poilce were told to meet up with us. Insurance was taken care of everyone was ok, and no one was yelling and calling each other asshole and stuff like that. Once everything was taken care of I took her to the hospital and got her neck checked and good news, its nothing more then a sore neck. She still has to deal with it but thats what pain killers are for. 

So if things are true, if bad things happen on your wedding day, your marriage will last forever. And your first year is always the hardest, then 2014 should be good for the most part. But hey, awesome things happened in 2013 so I can't say it was a bad year, and I can't say it was the best year, but all I can say is that it had extreme lows with plenty of highs in between. I will be posting on LJ more this year because it will be better to just show links to top 10 posts or something silly like that. I hope for the best of 2014, I will be working hard to get going on  3D stuff and post more. I would just like to take the time I have now to learn more about blender and not worry about final product even if I want to have the start of a small animation going before the end of the year."

Depression, alcohol abuse, in general feeling like shit for being a shit person.

"event","For a while now I have been having a huge battle with depression. I say only one thing but its so many other things as well but just get one out. So whats been eating me, lack of friends, lack of money, and lack of direction. Granted if you look at my life you will see that I do have a good group of friends, we don't talk much but each time we do it makes me feel a bit better even if its just responding to a journal entry or artwork. I don't share notes nor do I get on any of the messengers but I do add a bit more to just a typical ""Cool pic bro"" or ""Hope you feel better bro"" I have had a few strings of comments going on journal entries on FA and DA and it was all good. 

My job is amazing, granted the work kind of sucks but I can't say anything bad about the place. They pay good, they give me what I need to make a living, working conditions are ok, but its a fun job and I love the fact that they are still growing. Just look at the headlines and skim a few things and see the growth in the past few years. 

http://brainerddispatch.com/stories/040503/new_0405030009.html (The bad times)
http://brainerddispatch.com/news/2012-08-24/clow-stamping-expands-meet-high-manufacturing-need (Things are picking up, right around the time I was hired)
http://brainerddispatch.com/news/2013-09-06/clow-stamping-sees-expansive-growth-sales-jobs (another addition in my first year)

And there are many other things to boast about when it comes to this job. We got an award from John Deere for being the best on time and lowest toss out rating of something like 45 parts for every one million parts made. So like I said, this is a good job and know that if times get hard again, I can trust that we will make it and pull out of it all over again. 

But back to other things. I still feel a bit empty on the inside and still feel that I lack something in my life. I know what that is now and I am going to set forth to try and get things worked out. A while back there was an accident at the end of the road before you turn to get on my road. The wife and I took off hearing that it was just outside the house to see what happened. A guy on a motorcycle fell off and broke something and was in all kinds of messed up. I just stood there and watched not knowing if I should go and help. The next day my wife talks to the cop that was there and he said ""Stupid asshole should have just came up to me, I could have used the help."" Also told me that I should show up if I can and see if there is anything that I can do. 

So tonight, I'm alone. The wife is gone with her mom for some reason and I hear an ambulance go. Then I hear them again and decide that I should go and check it out in case they need help like last time. I follow the recovery truck down some back roads and see that there are fire trucks and squad cars everywhere. I get out of my car and rush to where the trucks and everything are and see that there is a car flipped over in the ditch. One person was able to get out and was in the back of one of the ambulances talking to a county officer and see that the fire department along with first responder and EMTs getting the other person out. They called for the stretcher so an officer and I went and grabbed it. After getting the other person out I helped with getting him into the back of the ambulance. 

It felt great to do this all over again and now see that I need to get back into this again. This was what stated me on a right path in life. I slowed down my drinking and didn't do so many crazy things. Still did it but didn't do them that often but this was the thing that helped me get out there more, do more, and made me feel better. However, I still hate the outcome of the last call I had back in 2011. I don't like going down the road to the call but feel that there was nothing that I could have done. The guy's neck was broken, there was blood coming out of his ears and mouth but still, I feel like there could have been more I could have done. 

Oh well, life goes on and its time for me to get going. I have a few things I need to do before bed and back to the same old same old in the morning. And look, I used one of those fancy new icons that EB (YOU WILL ALWAYS BE EVILBUGS TO ME DAMMIT!!! also, forgot your new name again) made forever ago. See, things are looking up already."

Shes eating again but we now have to work out on the work out part of her life. It will take some time to get her back to the gym but sooner or later she will be back and walking. Its the only way shes going to lose weight and get things going again. 

As for me. Still busy with work working 6 days a week (picking up as much overtime as I can and trying out a new position at work for a bit to see if I will stay with it. I get to keep the raise that comes with it even if I say no to it after a few days trying it. I did get to run around and try it one day and didn't like it too much but its one of those things where you have to get used to it and then you will enjoy it. 

It has come to my knowledge that I don't use any social media type thing anymore besides this and thats rare as hell. I haven't posted anything to Tumblr, twitter is dead to me, FA and DA are just as rare and facebook. Activated it for 1 month and never used it so got deactivated again. Been lurking Tails Refuge for a while but yet, I can't RP and I hang out around the Status update things and post there more then anywhere else. I might just leave that as well but who knows what i'm going to do. 

For the rest of the week its cleaning and cleaning and work and cleaning till everything is sorted and put away. I will post back later and see what happens. maybe something fun and excite... No wait, that will never happen."

This is the rock. Something is here but don't know what it could be. Been told the same thing by 3 people. My wife, our teacher, and a friend of my brother. Each of them weren't told anything and said about the same thing. Something major happened.

This was found near the rock by my brother and he was never told anything about the rock. The wife and I didn't tell him till a few days ago when he had a friend over and told us that something was there giving us the third person to tell us the same story. The shovel was found with the tip sticking out of the ground.

This is just a full shot pre-dig, I did try digging a while back but didn't find anything and felt as if this was pointless and stopped.

This is after a day of digging. The top hole is the one that I got really deep. I didn't think that I was going to find anything so stopped and went and dug the second hole for a bit but got the same feeling as before. 

So with that, what do?"

"event","I just don't like where I see the industry going. Everything is online and depends too much on the servers. You no longer need to have friends in your town to play games, you no longer have to ask someone if they want to play with you and sit in the same room with them and have a nice little chat and get excited about them being able to pull something off that you were having some hard time with. Ok that last part can still exist but playing games with others will soon be a thing of the past. Sharing a game with someone is going to be dead with the XboxOne and if idiots like it enough then it will keep going and we will be stuck with the next gen after this gen upcoming gen to be like a PC with Steam. Hell, its not a bad Idea in a way but if you download a over hyped shit game, you are now stuck with that game and can't go to a pawn shop, game stop, or anything else to get rid of the game. You can't even give it to a friend that had some interest in playing the game. 

I love places like Play n' Trade and pawn shops are the best. I get to go and find games that no one plays anymore, find games that I have lost, got stolen, or just rented on the weekends and never finished. Not only that, its always fun to learn things that I never knew about the older games because I was never able to read or able to finish, able to play, able to enjoy, and able to afford at the same time. It saddens me that this first started on the PC and people liked it enough that it stayed. Not saying anything bad about steam for the most part. I don't use it myself because I don't play that many games but from what people told me it was cheap and not sure if this is true, (help me on this because I don't know much about steam) but you can trade games and you can re-download them at anytime.

But I now have to look at the sad fact that I won't be able to do that anymore if the Xbox and Playstation or even Nintendo do the same thing. Kids won't be able to go back and play games that they played on the old systems because they will no longer exist. The servers will be shut down, there will be no updates, they didn't have the disk in the first place. ok yeah, I wish I still had a bunch of the games I had back in the day before they were stolen or traded but hey, getting them back at a slow pace and getting them back at a higher price at times but its half the fun of getting them again. 

Now one more time with the trade in thing because I have heard some people bitch and say things like ""They are shitty places because they give you nothing for the game and raise the price"" Uhh... Yeah... How do you think a place makes money. Go work at a gas station and see the mark up on Candy and things like that. I have seen things get marked up by as much as 50% so yeah, there will be a mark up on everything. Pawn shops can be worse as I have given some games to one place and only got $2 each only to see them get marked up weeks later to 20-25. So yeah, it can be bad but try and sell it yourself on ebay if you don't want to deal with it. They base this a lot with the market and you can see the market value for games by going to www.videogamepricecharts.com and the value is based off of going rates on things like Ebay so if its a game that everyone wants, its going to be higher. 

So depending on how things work out the next few years, this might be it. The Wii in my opinion wasn't that bad of a system, the games were just bad or weird with few good ones in between. The WiiU, I still have to try it. XboxOne has no place here till they patch it so that the game that I bough is mine and no longer under their rules."

"event","Ok, going to kick in here and start using the site again and will be using tags and all that good stuff and make this all public again. So just going to start with the last three months of things that were going on. 

March

I guess this can start back in Febuary when I was getting ready for the wedding, I was excited but there was only one person that I really wanted to know about how happy I was. But yet, I haven't talked to her since like 2010 so I couldn't talk to her about it. It was a bit of a downer but left her a message saying that I was happy and that I wish we could have talked more. So the wedding went on and the reception was fun. A few bad things happened like I lost control in the slush because I didn't have good tires. Got home losing control about half way, did a 270 and looked down someones driveway as they were blowing the slush. I just went home and got a few things then went back to the bar and lost control again only this time I lost my bumper. I got there with the help of some people that stopped and took my bumper to the bar. Pictures were taken and I went to school with these guys but never really knew them but saw them a few times. The reception ended with everyone getting too drunk to the point that we couldn't stand it anymore. I got a hotel room for Jamie and I but had to have others stay the night because of the weather. It was still fun even if someone got a bit too much and made a mess of everything. I got to get to know a close friend of my wife while she was out with the other friend and a guy friend taking care of her and letting her throw up. 

April

Not much really happened here really got into my crochet stuff and got good news at work, started working the break press but at the same time they had to move me to another place because my setup times fell to 25% (needs to be at 85% to keep your job so they must really like me) so I had to move to the spot welding department at the end of the month. I enjoy working there and everything is on the up and up Production was 92% before Break press, 89% when I left break press, and now its up to 118% in spot welding with highest production of 210% (average is 119% lowest is 62%)

May

Once again nothing here to talk about too much. getting ready for summer and all that good stuff but yeah, really nothing here. Ok turned 27 and didn't care too much because depression kicked in and knowing that I didn't have money to pay bills (huge things happened with taxes that killed my mood hardcore and put me to getting out of debt) but got a few good things like a Limited Edition Mountain Dew Xbox that I got for about $65 and found out that it was going for about $300.

June so far

The only thing to report is that Jamie was sent to the grace unit and for people that don't know what that is, if you think that you want to die and have a plan, you go here to get help. Most people don't get help and go through with it. She wasn't too far gone because she will willing to go and wanted the help. Saturday she went in after work at about 11:30pm. After seeing the cuts on her arm, minnesota took her in and put her under 72 hour care. the first day wasn't too bad, the second day was ok, the third day was harsh, the forth day she couldn't wait to get out. She did have an ok day there but wanted better and wanted to be home. I took the day off and got her out and we had arby's as her freedom food. Things have gotten better and happy to have her home, she has a nice little pill thing going and she has to talk to some other doctors and social workers and maybe she will be on disability as they said that her anexity is so bad. Till things are worked out its going to be much harder to get everything done. 

So yeah, thats all for now. updates to come when they can."

Twitter will be as active as it has been and will pick up more in a few months. Studio LJ will be active again in a few months as well once I get the money for a new desktop and everything that goes with it including a new place to live. But a lot has happened so going to go and post the good news and vibes while I still have them.&nbsp;<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Long story is long""><br />as of late I have become sick of how things work at my current job and decided that I was gong to do something about it. I hear on the radio all the time about a temp to hire place in&nbsp;brained&nbsp;so decided to go and check them out and apply for it. The next day I got my interview and tell them that I am looking for temp to hire and sure enough there is a place about 45 min drive from my house (15 mins longer and about 5 more miles, its a slow back road area so&nbsp;that is&nbsp;why its a longer trip then my current job.) so I take up the job offer and they want me to start the weekends from 2-10pm. I go and talk to my boss lady and tell her that I no longer want to work weekends because of this new job.&nbsp;<br /><br />I tried to give it to her as easy as I could and told her that I could work all the weekdays she got pissed and didn&#39;t talk to me for a few days. Things at this place got worse and was more of a pain in my ass then ever before, I really wanted to just walk out of work and just forget about what could happen to my residents. I did my best and did my job as I always did, report all the things and didn&#39;t bring anymore drama to the whole thing. I took care of the people that didn&#39;t give a shit about me and told me that I was only there to cook and clean for them. Told them that this is there house and if they chose to not clean, we won&#39;t go anywhere or get anything.&nbsp;<br /><br />With everything going on including the residents&nbsp;hatting&nbsp;me for telling them to clean when they sat at work all day and played pool (they tell me their job is so hard how they had to mow one lawn with a tractor and play pool all day) the job became more and more&nbsp;unbearable&nbsp;and I was really looking forward to working at clow for the weekend. Same noise level but the machines didn&#39;t talk back and we had a better time working together.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now its time for a day to day adventure. Monday I get a call from the employment place when I forgot my phone in the other room. I called back but didn&#39;t get to talk to the right person right away so this person told me that the job at clow was over and that I needed to return my boots and everything else they gave me. I was bummed out the rest of the day, calling banks and grandparents seeing if anyone could get me a loan or something for college to get something that wasn&#39;t going to jerk me around, I went to work a bit more pissed off but enjoyed the cooler weather and talking to a few residents that I don&#39;t talk to that often.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tuesday I was in a bit of a better mood so went to breakfast with Edo because even if I lost the job I still had a nice little boost in the bank and we&nbsp;haven&#39;t&nbsp;done anything in a long time. I packed my things that I needed to take to the&nbsp;employment&nbsp;center but didn&#39;t really want to leave Edo in the car or wandering in the pawn shop so because I had the day off, I would drop it off later. after breakfast I get a call from the right person saying that I got the job. I was excited about the turn around and after the phone call setting up my times on when I work I look at my current work schedule and start to play around with numbers before I go and talk to the boss lady. Needless to say she was not happy that I got a job and didn&#39;t want to talk to me anymore and didn&#39;t want to listen to what i had to say.&nbsp;<br /><br />Wednesday, I work in the morning and start cleaning the house. I get a call from a higher up and we talk about how to work out a new schedule and talk for a whole half hour about getting something set, I said that I would even work 8:30am to 10:30 on the weekends to make this&nbsp;transition&nbsp;as&nbsp;smooth&nbsp;as I could still working weekday mornings. The way boss lady was acting made me not want to work anymore as she was more worried about her not getting her third vacation in this year. Wish I could afford to by some PTO and get a vacation that isn&#39;t asking for one day off and&nbsp;having&nbsp;to come back home as soon as I could so I can work in the morning. anyway, the higher up was better about me leaving and even gave me the weekend off so I can have two days off before I begin my new job.&nbsp;<br /></lj-cut><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""TLDR LOL""><br />**************<br />***TLDR &nbsp;***<br />**************<br />I don&#39;t know what is really going to happen at my old job but i did state several times that I would work things out and still be there when needed before I work at my other job. with the boss lady being all pissed off and&nbsp;frazzled&nbsp;(and I haven&#39;t spoken to her yet because she hasn&#39;t called so once I find out, I find out whats going to happen.&nbsp;<br /></lj-cut><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","My job sucks and if it wasn't for the fact that I have been using art to vent and get rid of a lot of rage, there would be alot of decapitated people in a 15 mile radius of Papa Murphy's. I worked from 8-3:30 (and have to do it again in the morning) and had to listen to stupid people on the phone ask for the pizza deal. I kind of wish that people would learn to not call about some kind of a special like that because we did this last year, we did it with the pumpkin pizzas (FUCK!!!! THATS NEXT!!!! *RAGE*) and the shitty heart pizzas. 

Anyway, rage and shitty job aside I had CPR class today and though I was really going to bomb the test. The most you could get wrong was 4, I got 3 making it a pass. I felt stupid yelling at the dummy even if everyone else was doing it, I also felt stupid telling someone that wasn't there to go get the AED and call 911 or whatever we were told to yell out. Oh well, passed it and still need to get my books for EMT class that starts next week. I would also like to note that I was the only male in my CPR class room, I felt so out of place.

Final thing before I get something to eat because i decided to not eat today, my car now has 100,000 miles on it. here is to another 100,000 with less speeding tickets, more epic trips, and I just cleaned the carpets so if anyone spills coffee in it, they well die. Stupid fact that no one will give a shit about, I bought the car when it had only ~34,000 miles on it. yay for pointless facts.

Also because a few people wanted to know, I do work Saturday from 10-4. So on friday (8-2) I will be online for a while after work but might start using this new thing called iScribble.net. I really don't know how it works but I will be online during that so if I find out how to add people to the chat, IM me and we can draw boobs or whatever we decide to draw.

Anyway, the rest of the week is free, I will be online a lot more till tuesday as well, I have to go to school again. 

And shit, while on another final thing. I will no longer be talking to people if they use their cellphones for IM. I grow tired of waiting for you people to respond and the only one that hasn't pissed me off and gotten all BAWWWWWW over the fact that I like to leave during the chat is Frosty who will stay on my AIM. The rest (mostly yahoo dipshits) fuck you and use your fucking computer. 

That is all, really. God I'm hungry."

I don't know why I can't sleep. Been up since 6:30 and I'm tired but just can't sleep. I lay in bed and try and sleep but just lay there looking at the posters in my room.

Finished that and trolled a few forums and decided to play a little bit again, only to go and check video stuff and messed up something. (going to try and figure it out but no rush. It works fine but the graphics suck ass. Its like trying to play on the Super Nintendo.) So now thats gone I might as well start working on a few stupid things like music and my art. 

Speaking of music, this song kicks ass.

I listened to it on the way to work and once again on my way back from work. Speaking of work, I went into asshole mode and yelled at this bitch from the home office. She called and wanted to talk to boss lady while we were busy. I was already pissed off for being at work, getting a call from rob about how he was ""sick"" and being the only one that can pick up the phone at work, (the other two don't know how to do it or don't want to and that just made me more pissed off) I put her on hold and went back to making the pizzas for the retards.

She called back again and said that she was on hold for a long time, I went into asshole mode and told her that we were fucking busy and hung up on her, I thought it was funny. 

Anyway, going to try my had at OC again after work and see if I can find any lessons on flash and try to do that again."

WarZone is now free under GPL and I haven't tried to see if it can be played online but going to try working that out in the morning with Rab. So I have been kind of addicted to these games and have been playing all day (because some little fag ran off with my fucking tablet and I WILL BUST HIS KNEE CAPS when he brings it back.) I'm going to try and draw more in OC and not just use it for Inking my crap art. 

I don't think I'm going to do the online OC till next week because I want to see how well I can draw with the tablet before jumping in and getting mad at myself because my drawing sucks 50 times harder, (note the reason for using it for ink on the other crap) on the tablet but should get a hang of it sooner or later. 

Anyway, my room is cold and the cat needs to die or stop being a whore. I'm tired and now a link to the game if anyone wants to play as well.

I kind of knew that I was doing it wrong because I have been told that none of the new ones let you network. Well, she gave me the program and told me everything else I needed to know. I get everything set up and we can draw together but, I didn't have my tablet. So I tried to draw a few things with the mouse and gave up and watched her go at it. 

I was vary amused seeing her at work and doing everything that she was doing. Then she starts asking about my character. So not only was she going to help me setup, she was going to do some free art for me as well. 

<img src=""http://d.furaffinity.net/art/evilbugz/1232822282.evilbugz_zeilvos3.jpg"" alt="""" />

I would have to say that this is a sneak peek of the new Johnny. I'm going to do away with the hat, It was good when he was a skater but because I have been rewriting the series (I will get to that later, don't want to talk about it now.) and have decided to do away with that hat. 

So when she wanted to know about the hair I went online to find something for her to look at and get an idea. She goes back to drawing but I run off to a forum real quick, she gets back to me on aim and this happens.

(11:24:27 AM) evilbugz: Like that? 
(11:25:07 AM) Zielvos: I can't see what you did there
(11:25:15 AM) evilbugz: The red?
(11:25:41 AM) evilbugz: Let it play for a little while :3
(11:26:01 AM) Zielvos: I just saw the upper lip move
(11:26:31 AM) evilbugz: O_o
(11:26:36 AM) evilbugz: Is it not inked yet?
(11:26:48 AM) evilbugz: It should be all inked and there be like red hair
(11:27:08 AM) evilbugz: Oh with oC if you dont have the window up it wont play what Im doing xD It pretty much pauses
(11:27:30 AM) Zielvos: oh.
(11:28:19 AM) Zielvos: I'm now seeing the begining of the ears, 
(11:28:21 AM) evilbugz: I forgot to tell you hahaha
(11:28:32 AM) evilbugz: You got a little ways to go
(11:29:02 AM) Zielvos: *facepalm* I will be in the OC chat window thing from now on.

So While I was dicking around on the internet OC paused and I didn't get to see what she was doing. It was still kind of fun to watch her draw everything that happened like 10 minutes ago. I even saved the OC session so now I can watch it over and over again.

So I have to return the favor soon and give her something awesome or do something awesome for her. What that is, I don't know yet but I'm sure that I will come up with something. But this was fun even if all I did was draw a silly hat that we never used, but now I have to learn how to draw hair because the hat is gone.

UPDATE: I won't be able to do the OC for a while yet because my brother took the tablet. Its at his friends house and I don't want to go there and get it myself so I will have to wait till the retard gets home on Monday or sometime around there. And this whole time I thought I lost it because I was drunk."

The thing is, when I'm at cons, I don't take too many pictures. Well I think I found a way to fix that using a travel companion. 

Now I could bring my fox puppet with me but when on the train, that might make me want to do something stupid like put on a puppet show or become a ventriloquist on the train or god forbid the plane. So I want to find a non puppet plush that I can take with me, or better yet, find someone that can make me a plush of my character once I get him redesigned this spring. 

If anyone can point out (don't ask them for me yet, don't have anything official yet) someone that can do that, it would be much appreciated. (sorry I can't offer much but fail art if you want that.)

"event","So I'm sure people have heard of the bible codes before and how it has been right so far. I decided that I was going to look up what the bible codes say of Obama, and so far its true. But here is were things get odd. Hes in the Assassination Code as well and the bible code states that he will be assassinated sometime this year between September 29th to November 30th. The thing is, after Obama is killed Hillary becomes the president. How can this happen when Biden is the VP. Well the site has a good theory and I'm going to stay with it, Biden resigns sometime before September and Obama decides to give the VP seat to Hillary. 

Read this and see where i'm coming from. http://www.satansrapture.com/obama.htm 

So we hear that Obama is going to die. Hes already been attacked by a Neo-Nazi group called Aryan Nations and they show up in the bible code under guilty, but there is also conspiracy related to the gunman stating that the Aryan Nations could have been set up (doubt it because they look vary anti-obama). The thing that I want to know is where hes going to be killed. The bible code said that there is a crowd, so this could be during a address to the nation (something bad or something good) or hes on his way to an event where there will be a crowd outside his limo. 

So now hes dead, Hillary steps in and now she finds the Antichrist. Shes not going to die, but shes going to introduce the Antichrist to the nation in some way either by having him become the VP once she takes over. Hes going to prove that he can be someone that we can trust, (if you know anything about Satan from the bible, you will hear that hes a smooth talker and not to bad looking to the eye. Also Twain's book, ""The Mysterious Stranger"" talks about Satan as well.) and might become the next president. 

Now, we don't know everything yet, the bible code is not clear on everything but we have to take all the info that we are given and prevent things from happening. The bible code can change and has different endings depending on events. Example of this, Hillary wins the election and McCain still loses. He gives up the run because of heart problems and the next person that is going to take his place, people just didn't like him at all. 

***MY THEORY STARTS HERE***

So Hillary is still a huge player in this game, without her The Antichrist might not make it and will have to try and find another way in. But the bible code states that her meeting The Antichrist is going to happen. Don't know what role he will take but he will be a man, around 30-37 years old. He will meet Hillary sometime between 2010 and 2011. If he runs and becomes president, he will be swarn into office in 2012 and his final form, his true self will show on 12/12/12. It will six months, six days, and six years since 6/6/06.

12/21/12 will be when he starts all kinds of things that will plunge the world into darkness. Trying to prove that there is no god, that there is nothing after death, as well as starting to take over the world threw wars and power. But there is hope if everything goes bad. In 2014, someone known as the hero will show himself.

Lets see how things play out. 

***UPDATE***

Upon looking at www.satansrapture.com (the bible code site) this went across the screen.

I'd like to see it. 

I was watching the news eariler and they showed the temps around the US. It was warmer in Fairbanks Alaska then it was here. Fairbanks was 31F while it was about -21F here. I didn't go to work because the car wouldn't start, old battery, the date on it was Aug 02 so yeah, its time for a new one sometime soon.

In game related news, I started playing Super Mario World again. I also got a program on my computer that I can make my own levels and such. Good weekend project to go along with all the other random retarded crap that I do on the weekend. 

It looks cool and you get to see all the little things that you might not know about.

"event","Today was vary slow, I gave up trying to get the scanner and tablet working. I guess the laptop just hates them or something. I have to talk to the doctor in the morning because of the event log that I needed to keep, I also had to write the weird ass dreams that I have been having. This also includes the moods that I have had threw out the day. I think hes going to put me in with a therapist for a while after the EEG. 

I'm going to try and get all my old drives cleaned off and try and put all my info on the USB Drive. Going to use the 80GB and 160GB on the new computer and getting a blu-ray drive as well. Its still going to be a while, I just hope I get it before July."

"event","For the last few days I have been feeling kind of down but these dreams, I think helped me. To start out a few days ago, my mom and dad were thinking of going back to Brandon to see what has changed In the 15 years. I was thinking of doing this on my own this summer and just recording what the place looks like. 

In this dream, the whole family and I arrive to the old house that we lived in. The house has a second floor now but thats not the dumb thing about it, the rooms looked like the cabin at grandma and grandpas house. We walk around and look at the old place and see different things that have been done to it. During this dream I started to cry, just out of no where I started to cry.

It was like I was on a ghost hunt and being overtaken by an emotion that you have no control over. My sister was making fun of me about it and i yelled at her saying I have no idea why I'm crying. Even when I woke up I still had no idea why I was crying but I went back to sleep again. 

In this second dream, I was sitting outside when the yard fox came up to me and sat beside me. I pet the little fucker and decided that I should go back inside as it was getting late. The fox looks at me and wave at her to come in. (The yard fox is a female BTW) I gave her a little strip of beef jerky and she comes downstairs with me back to my room. My sister's stupid cat had kittens in my room so I throw the kittens in a box and give them to my sister. The fox was chasing a mouse in my room while I was sitting at the computer working on some stuff. 

I'm now getting ready for bed and tell the fox to come lay down with me. She was in my closet a bit afraid about something. I grabbed her and sat down with her at the computer trying to keep her calm. She calmed down after a while and took her to bed with me. I got under the sheets while she slept on the top cover on the other side of the bed. As I lay there she gets on top of my chest and lays there. I hold on to her and she leans to the arm that is now supporting her. She looks at me and starts talking to me. Its nothing important, we were just repeating something that happened on an episode of south park. 

As I slowly start to sleep in the dream I slowly start to wake up in real life. When I fully wake up I felt awesome, felt the best I felt in the last few days. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to try and catch yard fox who is now named Vix. And if the doctors find out that something is wrong in my head and want me to take pills that might get rid of these dreams, I will strangle them with there stethoscope."

"event","When I was younger, I did some wild and crazy things, I did these things because I had nothing better to do or didn't have a game to play. I would come up with these ideas during the summer and listened to other peoples pranks that they pulled of on other people. I'm going to talk about two of my favorite shenanigans. 

Shenanigan #1

In 2002-03 I was watching tv and back then G4 was for computer nerds. The host was talking about a prank that he pulled off with the number pad on the keyboard. This gave me a good idea. In a shop class the teacher never really kept his eye on all of us, he worked on other little projects with other students and was there to more or less help if we needed it. Down the hall there was a computer lab that was empty at that time and made sure of it, it was always unlocked because sometimes teachers would send students there to use the computer for some research for projects and such. Well, the only people that would come in were students and they would get a kick out of it. 

Our user names were our names like mine was gevans and four numbers were used for the password.  A few weeks before I noticed that when ever kids went to the computer classes or library, everyone used the number pad for the password. If you look at your cellphones and the number pad you will see what I did there. The thing is, you would never notice that it was out of place and because the passwords always came out like this **** you would never know. I ran around with a pen and switched the 1 and 7, 2 and 8, 3 and 9, and I did this to all 32 keyboards before the teacher knew I was gone.  

The awesome part of this was that my friend had the only class that had that as the assigned computer class room. All the kids couldn't get their passwords to work and the teacher called the system admin to see what could be wrong. He spent half an hour trying to find out what was wrong before he found out that all the numbers were changed. After that day, the door was locked. 

Shenanigan #2

This next one got a little out of control so we had to stop before the police started watching. Shortly after SOCOM Navy Seals came out, some friends and I decided to play it in real life in town. It started with the 5 of us and we got 10 others to join and be the game. We used Paint ball guns and that was the fist part that wasn't smart. They were a little loud and it was worse when we missed and hit the houses. After a few days we decided to stop and the police started to do more rounds in the area. It was fun but we knew that we were going to get in trouble and the police were not going to take it easy on us. 
<hr>
I hope to do more shenanigans this year and was thinking of pulling off something for someones birthday and posting it on youtube but have nothing set up yet and don't have anyone to help out to pull something off. I'm tired of the random retarded shit that I pull off at walmart like putting condoms in old ladies shopping carts, taking bikes for test drives, and putting weird things in weird places. Like getting some bottles of KY and putting them in with the bananas.

I want to come up with stuff that would be easy to record, and can be done in fount of the unknowing public like a hidden camera show, or better yet, a spin off of urban ninja. I will come up with something fun here in a while."

"event","UCK!!!! My brother came home yesterday and the internet has died. He was using the webcam on MOM'S laptop and was talking to his friends and downloading a few new albums and countless amounts of porn. The ISP has a little meter that tells us how much of our allowed internet bandwidth we have used 100GB. I checked it when he got back home and it was sitting at 65%. I check it now and its sitting at 89%. This is where they slow us down and things like the messenger long me out.

Also, there will be a day where I won't be online and this could last a few days. We don't know when they will shut us off and ask for the stuff back but its going to be soon. Once we get disconnected, dad will have to get things set up with the other people and that could take a few days.

"event","Well, there goes another year down the crapper. To me it was a bit of a bad year as was seen in my last post but I hope that the next year will be better. I have looked into a few games and movies that are going to be released next year and I just hope that I can keep up with them. I was going to try and include art and music this year but no albums came out that I really liked and its hard to pick art when so much is released for free. Anyway, here is the best of 2008.

<lj-cut text=""2008 blows""><b>Movies</b>
I saw a few movies this year and wasn't disappointing at all. There were a few movies that I wish I got to see and the one that I was watching now (its late and can't stand being upstairs with the family right now. We can't sit and watch a movie, we just watch and pause and the length of the movie is tripled) is good but I think its just going to be to late and made the list already. Sorry Hulk, it looked good but the family is retarded.

I saw only four movies this year, Cloverfield, Batman: The Dark Knight, Ironman and Hellboy 2. All these movies were awesome, lots of action, good acting, great screenplay and awesome story. Because I only saw four movies it will be down to a top four instead of top five. 

#4 Hellboy 2
This movie was good but it could have been better in a few ways. I would like to see this movie again because of the story and the humor that was put into it. There is not much to say and that is why its at #4.

#3 Cloverfield
This movie kicked ass, I'm going to watch it when i get a day off and its going to abuse the sound system. The thing I liked the most about this move was the way it was presented, the first person view just made the movie even better and the mystery that is Cloverfield. They hint to so many things that you have to watch it a few thousand times to try and piece everything together. The story is awesome, like I said before, its like the blair witch, but you get to see what they are afraid of. 

#2 Ironman
Marvel, you just fucking won. This was just an awesome movie and a good way to introduce us to the person behind the mask much like the first Spiderman and Batman. It wasn't too fictitious either, a real setting, a real person, and an enemy that wasn't way too out there like in other Super Hero movies. This movie had a huge fight with #1 as its the first and I think last as we just go to a movie with all the marvel heroes in the next movie where #1 knows its not his place to be the hero.

#1 Batman: The Dark Knight
This movie was nothing less then epic, once again its almost real and still a little far fetched at the same time. But the reason that this got first was because the story was nothing short of amazing. The movie had a nice flow of action, the acting was awesome and the joker was played out vary well. The ending was the best part, he knows that hes nothing more then a vigilantly and not truly a hero. I don't want to give it away to all those that haven't seen it so I will stop there. Also if you liked the first one and this one and haven't seen Gotham Knight, get it. This would be on the list as number 2 but it was never in the box office. Its a great movie as well as it talks about Bruce a little more then what the movies did and its a great filler between the first and second batman movies. 

<b>Games</b>
This year, i didn't play a lot of games and sadly, a lot of them were vary disappointing. Not going to have a top list of the year as I kind of stayed away from games this year, I did play a few games but not as many as before. The games that I played were Need For Speed Undercover, Midnight Club Los Angeles, and Saints Row 2. Need For Speed and Midnight Club were ok, I liked them but both of them didn't get me too far before Saints Row 2 came out. 

I love this game, and it became a bit of an addiction to me. I would still be playing now and on my third round but decided that I needed to try playing something else and now playing Call of Duty 2, 3, and 4. So Saints Row 2 wins the 08 game of the year. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to go and play it, again.</lj-cut>

"event","Well, here it is. This is just 2008 in review, I will write up the best of and post that later.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Shitty year was shitty""><b>January</b><br />January was kind of lame, nothing really happened but there were a few fun things that did happen. Vani got free tickets to Cloverfield and asked if my roommates and I would like to go. The movie kicked tons of ass and became one of my favorite moves (not high on the all times but on the movies of 08). The car started to have a few problems that got fixed later on with money that I really didn't have. I was still having problems with art at school, and school wasn't working for me but still tried to stay with it. I was also getting vary pissed at a few people on AIM and Yahoo saying that I wasn't responding at times. Busy with trying to get shit done in class and just stressing out about that. <br /><br /><b>February</b><br />Well, this month was kind of fun. I went over to Shawna's apt to do a ghost hunt and it was kind of weird. After my fight with storyboard class I dropped out of it and was going to try again next time. The teacher was really awesome about it, he told me that he saw a lot coming from me and that I could get more work done if i didn't worry about it being nicely done. Also Vani came over and showed us this http://www.sheezyart.com/view/1388413/ I'm posting this here again for the lulz. <br /><br /><b>March</b><br />I kind of hit rock bottom here. Weed wasn't doing anything for me so we started doing shrooms and that was really messing with me. At the same time it was messing with me it was making me more awake of what I was doing wrong. I wasn't happy in college anymore and started to hate games seeing that they weren't fun anymore. Thing is I knew what was going into making a game, and I didn't like it and feared that a crash is going to happen in the game industry. that soon people would know that games suck because of how unbalanced everything was, more money goes into one thing and the other two elements fall and die.  <br /><br /><b>April</b><br />I will only post this. http://soulhunter20099.livejournal.com/101621.html<br />FCN was just fucking awesome. It was nice to see Evan Li again and also got to meet Furball2k for the first time. If it wasn't for them, the con would have kind of sucked and I know they would of had a hard time if it wasn't for my roommates and I for hooking them up with a room. I hope to see you all again at some other con and wish things worked out for MFF. Also something snapped, I don't have an official date on it but was completely off line for a few days. A few people knew what happened and word got around about it quick so I didn't get people bugging me about being gone for so long. I did LSD and had a vary bad time with it. Tripped out for a few days and when I felt that I was ok to drive, I went home and have been here since. <br /><br /><b>May</b><br />Still tripping on LSD and after lurking on 420chan, I was told that it had a vary bad effect on me, and was still in my system. It took a few days to work out but it was gone after a while. My friend Andy came back and I heard about Vince and how he has been acting. More shit down the road with him doing drugs non stop but save that for later. Andy and I celabrated both of our birthdays and that is when I began hanging out at big lou's. I did a bit more art crap using open canvas (don't have it anymore) and a few other little bits of art. At the same time all this is happening, having a few little problems at home, mom and dad are always fighting and can't stand my brother and sister.<br /><br /><b>June</b><br />It started out kind of bad, Rab was moving and a little drama was in the air with a few people because I didn't want to talk to a retarded bitch. I really start hateing this place after awhile. I hate the people in this town and the cops are just the highshool jocks that never got anywhere and to keep the smarter people down they became cops. I also started using Ubuntu Studio and that didn't last long. It had more problems then I was having at the time. Nothing worked out and it pissed me off. I was working at the deerstand and loved that job, it pissed me off from time to time but it was because someone was being stupid.<br /><br /><b>July</b><br />I went to work during a tornado. That was awesome. But the best part of this month was The Dark Knight. Instant best movie of the year and on the top list of my favorite movies. Also saw Hellboy 2 and that wasn't bad, could have been better. But I still liked it. <br /><br /><b>August</b><br />This was the month of stupid ideas. Stupid cartoon ideas and getting way to far a head of myself didn't make things work out. I also started working at the pizza place that I still hate. The people that I work with are awesome, the people that come in are fucking retarded. I feel like I'm working at the gas station again. <br /><br /><b>September</b><br />Well the car was fun to drive in the rain, the roads get a little wet and I'm sliding all over the place. I also made this for reasons unknown even to me.<br /><a href=""http://img401.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dsc02535gt8.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/5803/dsc02535gt8.th.jpg"" alt="""" /></a><br />Slow month, nothing really cool happened. got new tires for the car and that was about it. OH and pot, lots and lots of pot. <br /><br /><b>October</b><br />I went back to hang out in the city for a day, things didn't work out the way they were planed but it was fun none the less. It was nice seeing tim and peter again and it was nice getting some of my things back. Also, a vary good person and one of the best cosuomers to ever come walking threw the door when I worked at the gas station died in an accident. He will be missed. Also Vince ran off and was sent to rehab, I don't know how that is going because I can't get a hold of anyone at his parents place. I also started playing saints row 2 and I can't stop playing it. *seizure*<br /><br /><b>November</b><br />Still hate my job, still playing Saints Row 2, and the loss of my computer along for more drama. Ok lets move on and finish this thing, vary tried and don't want to work in the morning. <br /><br /><b>December</b><br />I has Seizure and its fucking awesome. I got my new plates, and that fucking rocked.</lj-cut><br /><br />Well thats about it. See you next year and fuck off. :3<br />"

"event","After hours of Saints Row 2 and CoD2, some music and other forms of art. I must take a break from all of that to make a little post about a few things.

<b>Music</b>
So I got my keyboard for Christmas and have been slowly learning how to play that again. I was never really good at it in the first place but I knew how to play it a bit. I'm learning how to use Ableton (might get something else but I like it.) and working on a few untitled songs. Its gong to be like NIN but I think it might be off on the techno/trance side more kind of like Daft Punk. Its hard to give out an explanation of this style till I can get some songs made. 

<b>Art</b>
I have become a little more impressed with it now then in the beginning of the year, and have been thinking of releasing something this year or next year depending on how things go this year. Like I said in my FA journal, ""Granted this one won't work out as well as the rest but starting a comic might help me with art."" ~Zielvos. I will begin working on animation again but kind of waiting for a new computer to pop up in the mail. Right now the laptop is being a bit abused with the music and junk. 

<b>2008</b>

I will have a longer one written later but this year just kind of sucked. A few things happened that were cool like FCN and meeting a few new furs. To me this was a year of trying to find out that what I wanted to do wasn't really what I wanted to do. I really see that its like art now that I've been in it. Like I have said before and what I tell a lot of people about art happens a lot here. An artist that is doing it for fun will do it longer and better then letting someone take away most of your creativity to have you draw something for them. 

I will have something better written up and a bit of a best of from a few comics, movies, and games."

"event","So today didn't go too bad. It could have been the fact that I was drunk threw most of it as I pulled off a little con trick. You see, when I go someplace and we can drink while there, like a convention or group meet, I have booze on me and there is always a vending machine that has coke or any other soda that you might want. Take a bit of a drink and fill it back up with a bit of booze. I get drunk while walking around the convention and no one knows unless you try and watch me count things on the floor. 

That went over a little too well, about 4 of those and it was time to go back home to mess around with things. I played around with the keyboard that I got and tried to learn the music program while drinking two Heinekens. 

So what did this retard get besides drunk. 
- M-Audio Key Studio 
- Dark Knight on DVD
- 320GB USB Hard Drive

Thats about it. Food was awesome and yes, everyone pissed me off again, I want to play games when they got done playing games and ran off to do something else and kept asking me to save the game and let them play something else. That request was met with a big middle finger right in the face. 

Well, Christmas is over and hope that everyone had a good one and I won't be drinking till New Years Eve and if I'm lucky my boss will be a dude and not a dick and give me New Years Day off so I can sleep off booze an such. 

I will post a rant later because there are somethings I do want to rant about like cellphones and how I think they are just getting more fucking retarded."

We are a group of people that want winter to be shorter and to think of it as over on December 22nd as we start to warm back up again and get day light back. Upon leaving the world of the so called normal people, you will get a little thing in the mail saying that you are now a member of the Royal Order of the 21sters.

So to give you all a quick lesson on this, here is when things happen

Fall starts on June 22nd and ends on November 1st
Winter Starts on November 2nd and goes till December 21st
Spring starts on December 22nd and goes till kickoff on the Super Bowl that rings in Summer.

There is logic behind this and its all on the site.

Well, this would might just be some little video on youtube or if I learn how to use flash (getting it in a few weeks) I will make a stupid little cartoon. I was going to make something in synfig today but there were a few errors and have to get things fixed again. It was just going to be a stupid little christmas thing but I might not do it now because of synfig being a little messed up. 

In other random news, the black outs have been happening a lot less but still going to go and see a doctor in the morning if the clinic is open to see if its what I have been posting here or if its something else that is kind of like it but not as great to have as it gets worse after a while. I don't think its the worse and if it is, well i knew i was going to go crazy sooner or later. 

Anyway, there is white stuff outside and its been falling all day. I decided to snort a line of it and it gave me no Christmas cheer *cough* like I was looking for. Now that I think of it, I should finish my Dr. Foxso pic."

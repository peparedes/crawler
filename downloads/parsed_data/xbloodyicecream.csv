You know if I love you so that should give you some indication as to whether you can come or not. Significant others are welcome aslong as they're not absolute tossers and/or I don't like them. My 18th, my rules. I don't wanna hang around with a bunch of condescending whining ejits, ta very muh.
Anyway, rant over;
Bar will be there as its in a pub so please be respectful and don't bring booze, else I'll steal it as a bday pressie adn you know what I'm like, you won't get it back.
You can all stay in a tent next to the pub and it'll be right fun boy.
so, october the 2nd, hunworth. you know my email if you need any help, xbloodyicecreamx@hotmail.com. If you need to phone me, email me and ask for my number. There'll be plenty of lifts to and fro, so just ask about transport.

"event","Woah ok, where to start? What a fucking perilous adventure eek.
so first we end up in salhouse thinking thats where the rave is, turns out tasha read the message wrong, it was in salthouse.
so we're in norwich.
we go to some guys house who says he'll give us a lift. he has a paralysed arm.
he tries to roll a joint.
hilarity ensues.
some stoner hippy man that looked like rigid brigid arrived. they were all pleasant.
then someone else wants to give us a lift, in an old aa van of all things..
so eventually we arrive at the rave...
nothing like the last.
dean and i were stone cold sober and we despised it.
those people are the living dead. 
even dean thought they were gross.
so we thought, y'know, lets walk back to cromer.
in the dark.
along windy main roads.
with glow sticks.
and tabitha harris.
we stop at a hotel.
no one is alive.
we atempt to stay under the tree until light.
then we start walking again, end up in weybourne and try to phon a taxi.
apparently they dont think thta people need taxis at 3.30 am.
odd.
we stay in a bus shelter for a while, then begin our mini adventure again wehn it gets lighter.
so, we walk to sheringham.
some ravrs on the way back give us a 5 min into town.
then we try more taxis.
eat cndy.
attempt to commondeer a bus (unsucessful).
Eventually get through to a taxi nd arrive in cromer.
then i got a free bus ride home woooetc.
what a story. weird fucking hippies."

Its not just any normal party though. Daisy has two massive fields for a garden, and, like with her dads party, shes having people stay in tents in one field and having bands in the other.
So, if you get this, you're officially invited. You'll need to bring a tent and whatever else you'll need for staying over, and obviously a bottle or two. No drugs please.
If you know anyone who could play, give them my email address please, it would be much appreciated. 
This is going to be a very big party and you can invite friends/spouses etc.
Don't miss it, its gonna be v.cool.
Her address is 35 trunch Rd, Mundesley, and its the white house by the phone box, past the school on the way to trunch.
If you need anything email me....xbloodyicecreamx@hotmail.com

You may fwd this if anyone wants the info.

Blah blah etc, bad stuff happened, but good stuff also arised as I got to sort some stuff out with someone I'm very glad to be friends with. Melba still stinks and so does her ridiculous bilogical contributor.
Stacey was very sweet and amusing, she was shouting at freddie about mayhem again, telling him 'freddie, stop causing the mayhem' and poor lauren blackbeard ended up having to sleep at melba's 'house'.
Today Dean, myself and psychotic Tabi played in Cromer,  we went on the super cool road runner mini train and squirted people from it. We ate ice cream which was fun (all courtesy of psycho tabitha) and went on the pier and and went swimming and and dean chatted up old timers and and and *breathes* yeh that was it rally chaps.
Now, to deal with the person trying to hit on me on msn...seriously, how inept do you have to be?
Betty is ugly haha.
Bye."

"event","Yay, this weekend has been soooooo hectic.
On Thursday, Ginge took me to see Stza Crack (he's the singer from leftover crack for all you losers hehe) and it was sooooo cool. The first band were called Onslow, and they were shite, but the second band were called the mingers and were rather marvellous and should be playing at Ginge's all dayer yay. The singer fell on my feet and pretended to shoot me in the head, according to ginge she liked me haha. Yay for fanny.
Stza Crack dedicated a song to me wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooop and it was great etc etc. 
Oh, some idiot kid said something about being an emo kid with authority about ginge as he walked past, then i sorted it out with him telling him that Ginge isn't actually an emo kid, he just looks like one. Then the kid said something so so dumb, he said 'oh that's whjat annoys me about norwich, akll the kids that like punk dress like emo kids'. I corrected him yet again saying that Ginge doesnt like punk and he shook my hand with his sweaty little paw and said, 'k, I'm woirng, sorry'. Fair enough. Did I mention he was a stupid little skater kid and was getting progressively drunk?? Pah. Anyways, after the mingers (during which he made an utter tit of himself) he came up toi me, shjhok my hand and said, 'you were great etc' and i was like, kkkk, bye. Then he goes up to ginge and says aaah wow you were so great, you're the bassist, right? HAHA twat. It wa supposed to be his 19th aswell. Great way to spend it.
Later on when Stza was on, the kid kept going on about playing some sublime, and calling Stza Brad...me recokns he thought he was the DEAD guy from sublime haha. Then Stza went 'Yeh ok, I know a sublime song, it goes like this' and pours a fucking pint over the kid hahaha so fucking funny.
Then on Friday we saw anti-nowhere league, which was cool, the support was awful, the crusties were, well, crusty and we had to leave well before the end but pah. Wasnt as full as when i saw them last time, but twas still good. Saw a few familiar faces from the past. Bit weird.
The PPP as Ginge calls them (poser punk posse, this like 16 yrold couple who cover themselves in uk subs and pistols patches and anarchy signs) were there, pretending to knwo the words and mumbling them at the front, even to the new songs which errr, noone had heard haha. Losers.
Last night we went out for dinner at Pizza Express, Ginge was not happy with the service haha posh shit. Twas nice, but we both decided back to Figaros next time."

<b>Ok so I'm having  a BBQ this Saturday for not so many people! Little less hectic this time, me thinks.
Anyway, be like old people and bring a bottle and your significant other/friend if you are insecure.
Accommodation is available, yet we are revoking the usage of the infamous pad, so bring a jumper. Haha half of you won't know what that means. Yay for private jokes.
Come at about 7.30. 
Anyway, if you hadn't of guessed, this lame email means your invited. Most of you know where my establishment is, but if anyone needs directions just ask me.
Feel free to fwd this.
Sophie</b>

Oh shit, i forgot to invite Beth.....i'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on."

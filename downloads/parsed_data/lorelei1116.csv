I don't think that Walgreens is going to fold.  I am being driven to insanity by my pharmacy manager who I will have to work with everyday now until the strike is over.  One bright point though is that I will be able to sleep in for an extra hour.  Woo Hoo.  So I guess my life is not all terrible.  I am off to work soon to hear about tribulations and work with my split pharmacists.  Ah well things could be worse.  I could be out of work.  How is everyone doing.  I would love to hear from you all.  I check my e-mail about once a week.  So e-mail me. I am fighting with my association because living there is like living in a Nazi camp.  Does anybody have any adivce for me.  I would really appreciate it.  See you all later.  Thanks for reading my update."

"event","I have found a new haven and I think everyone should try it.  It is called Mr. Sheshas Coffe House and it is in Naperville.  I work a block away so if I have a bad day I can always go there for regreshment and calm.  It is a hooka bar where you can get the best tasting and smoothest tobacco smoking around.  It is wonderful.  We sat there for 5 hours last night smoking and talking and just generally relaxing.  It is great.  Anyway my BBQ is coming up and we are trying to frantically get the Condo finished before it comes around.  I am off to work soon.  Ack I wish I could just win the lottery.  That would be nice.  HEHE.  Oh well keep your fingers crossed we put into a pull at work for lottery tickets.  Maybe I will be able to quit tonight.  LAL LA LA LA LA"

I went to work after taking a day off and my pharmacist Jo said that she had missed me the day before.  They really need me over there it is great to know that all the hard work that I put in at work does not go unappreciated.  It is so nice to be complimented in such a small way.  I also found that a simple smile can go a long way.  I have a patient that comes to my store and the other day he told me that his good news for that day was that I was smiling and that I always smile when he is there.  He is Kidney dicease and he is getting dialisis but I can always make him smile.  I feel like I actually do something for my patients.  It is a great feeling.  Have a great day everyone and don't forget to smile at at least one person today."

I have started a journal that I right 3 good things that have happened to me that day.  It is a wonderful way for me to keep a positive outlook on life.  I have depression and I am always looking for ways other than my meds to lift my spirits.  This forces me to see the good things and notice them above the bad things.  It is making my moods much lighter.  Spring is coming and I miss the warm weather where you can sit out on your patio or balcony and look at the stars and the night.  I love doing BBQ and Beer Brats with Roy even though I don't like brats.  I just have hotdogs.  Well anyway everyone should smile at least once today to make sure they get their daily dose of Joy.  I know I sound really chipper but I am in a good mood which doesn't happen very often.  I am going to a job tonight at a store that I hate but I soujourn on because I won't be there for much  longer.  PROMOTION WOO HOO!!!!!!!   Any way see you all later.

Once the music played in the mind.  Once the colors ignited the music it flowed from mouth to ears.  
The music stunted silenced so.  The masses yearn to hear it's soft and gentle touch.  
Mouths proclaimed it's undying love and it soared above the restless times and brought peace to those in need.  
Let it show and gleam and sing again.  Do you want to hear it.  Will the masses love it again.

We were running around trying to move our of our old place and clean it and find them at the same time.  It was crazy like watching a movie.  I guess maybe I should start writing these stories down.  Maybe I will become a famous writer and you all can say you knew me when I was just ranting on live journal.  Any way I am doing well.

I am doing well my mood has never been better.  I have not payed bills on time and I am not worried about it for the first time in my life.  I have the money I just need to get it done.  I should probably get on that but I left all my info at home.  OOOPS.   Well I went to see Blade Trinity and it was a lot better than the second movie.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I have not hung out with John in a while.  I think that he may be sick of Roy and I.  We do call him a lot.  We just don't really have anyone else we like to hang out with so much.  He makes us both feel comfortable around him.  Roy and I are still gloriously happy.  Just writing about him is making me smile even though he is sitting right next to me.  I am still working for Walgreens.  I would love to go back to school but I will have to figure out money and time and today I am having a happy no worries day.  I will think about it tommorow.  We are setting up our Condo and as soon as it is finished we are going to have a party.   So fun!  Nate I have not been able to call at a decent time and I am not med at you for anything.  Just thought I would get that out there since I am just rambling on.  I have decided that worrying is not worth it.  It will probably only last for today or a week but right now it feels good not to worry.  I have to get off this computer soon but I will end with saying that everyone should look at the good things in their life.  It's hard because they are harder to rememeber but at least try when you read this.  Maybe it will make you worry a bit less.

You know people the president should not be deciding our moral issues we should.  We are going to turn this country into something without freedom of choice if people continue on this track.  I wanted Kerry because he had good polilcies and progressive ways of dealing with problems.  He also wanted to earn the respect of the world again.  Bush will just kill that.

What makes our minds so resistant to change or happiness when we are sad.  The world I should look at is much different then the one that I percieve.  It can be a wonderful beautiful colage of color and wildness.  But sometimes you want order and that same beauty can turn into ugliness.  I don't know maybe I am just as messed up as everyone else.

The stress is so unbearable and everyone tells you to look at the bright side of things.  It seems that the only thing that makes me happy is my husband.  The rest of the world seems to not care that I exist and therefore would have no problems with me not existing.  It's a one way cycle that won't ever stop.  You can't get a good job without an education and you can't get an education unless your rich or willing to work yourself to death.  It's so expensive that the people who have to work full time and get the jobs they can with just a high school degree can't go and better themselves.  Then you end up having money problems you can't pay your bills you get late fees and you just incur more debt and you can't get a better job because you have so many bills you can't afford to go to school and get a degree.  Then everyone tells you that you are ok and that things will get better.  I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!!!!!!!   Things are supposed to go your way some of the time.  But they are not for me.  The only thing I have to keep from a tall building or pills or a gun is my husband.  Please someone tell me that things do get better and how I can make that happen before my mind tells me that it is all for nought."

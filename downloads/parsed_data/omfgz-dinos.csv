"event","so school is going really well so far.
only the fifth day, but whatever.
i love my classes. this should be a good semester.
today after school we're going to go pick kenzie up.
then later tonight i'm not really sure what we're doing
yet.. probably hanging out with jason and his new ride!!!
i'm excited to see it. tommorow we're going to meet up
with my NEW friend cody and we're going to get coffee
and stuff then venture out onto our roadtrip to anniston.
we're going up there to get megan's cell phone charger 
but then we decided.. why not turn it into something fun?
so we're going to take some pictures and check out the
location and stuff while we're up there and just explore.
i'm rather excited. my last roadtrip like this was a blowout.
on our way back home tommorow we're stopping at steve and rae's 
house. they're having a party or something. i'm not sure.
pup just told me about it. this should be fun. it was the
last time. sunday i'm doing my friend chole's hair. this is
going to be my first actual hair sitting. i'm cutting, complex
coloring, and putting extensions in. i'm pretty excited b/c
i know if i can pull this off and do it all well that i am ready
to start doing this stuff all of the time. she's paying me for
it but it's all going towards megan's gastank since we have to
go all the way to hueytown to do it. idk, i'm seriously really
excited to do this. SO.. i've really got to figure this whole
college deal out. i know for sure that i'm going to transfer
my hours to bevil after i graduate and get my cosmo license.
i'll only have to go for half a semester. but after that..
i'm so confused. and i HAVE to get this stuff worked out before
summer. i'm going to go to uab with megan b/c we're getting a
place in southside. but.. i'm not sure on what i want to major in.
i mean.. should i do photography? music and managing? graphic design?
i really don't know. i want to do all three of those things.
megan is going to do radio type stuff. i'm overall excited.
just confused. and my dad is trying to contemplate on all of this with
me too. b/c like i said i have to make up my mind before summer.
but back to the subject of my school im in now. my contemporary world
issues teacher wants me to do a presentation to this class on Defaur.
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS. I'm so excited about getting my chapter
started here in alabama. ME, kayla ann, being in control of all of
our state's promotion for this. do you know how insane that is?!
i'm so excited. life seems to be getting better and better here
recently and i wouldn't have it any other way. oh but, my dad is 
finally going to have his back surgery soon and will be on total
disability and that's going to suck big time. he needs it though.


i think monday i'll finally show my parents my report card."

"event","it's sad when it gets to the point
that i'm so blind when it comes to
the obvious things that my friends
have to tell me whats going on and
what i need to do about it.
they've made me realize how much i'm
being screwed over by SEVERAL people.
i'm SO glad to know i'm being replaced.

p.s.
there was alot of sarcasm on that last remark..



but on another note..
i'll be really glad when it becomes
time for us to start loading this thing up.

<img src=""http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e184/omfgzdinos/102_1797.jpg"">

i feel like i need to just leave everything i have
in my life right now behind and make a fresh start,
get a new reputation.
i don't want to leave some of the things that i have..
but i think it'll help.
well.. then again it could destroy me.
i'm always up for taking chances.



but tonight i went to the thrift store with my dear
megan cochran, and we got so brown slacks and we cut
them off and made them cute. and i also got this really
cute vintage heart necklace on a really long chain.
it's lovely. i'm SURE i'll take a picture and you'll see it.
but why does it matter anyways.. no one ever reads this.


p.s. p.s.
michaela moved in with her dad in crestwood
which totally means i'll get to see her even 
less than i already do. this sucks. bad."

"event","i'm really pissed because i spent almost 10$ on this eisley crap on ebay and the person hasn't let me known if they shipped it out, hasn't contacted me back when i emailed them or anything so i gave them negative feedback and if i don't get the items in another 3 days or so i'm filing a paypal complaint on their ass. god. i don't get why people rip people off. it's so dumb.

i hope i win the blythe doll i'm bidding on because it's so cute :( i have a bunch of vintage doll stuff i'm also selling that were my mom's. i'm excited to get into a real hobby. ugh. i'm pissed because i didn't get to go to jackie's party today but whatever. that's okay. i just had a slice of pizza but i'm still hungry so.. i'll probably go eat more. i've lost about 8 pounds thought because i've been controlling my portions and not eating every 5 seconds. it feels good.

i need to charge my ipod because i can't live with just playing music off myspace. oh yeah. my computer was getting a new disk drive but my grandpa pulled the plug so it doesn't work anymore and i think i lost everything on it so i've been using the laptop. ughdfkhasfkasfaf."

"event","tonight.. if i said it was the best night ever i'd be lying but if i said it was the worst night ever i'd REALLY be lying. around 4:30 i was sitting by the window waiting for people getting worried nobody would come :-/ finally dana comes up and we started putting finishing touches on stuff and then jill came, and then pat. michala and melissa got lost or something so they were like.. late. while we were waiting for them we had like stupid snacks and danced and sprayed silly string outside. i fell into concrete though and seriously hurt my hand which i have to get checked out tomorrow. i think it's sprained at the most so no worries, i was still able to go on with the whole party but i had to wear ice on my hand but whatever like everyone said it was good i didn't like fall on my face. i would have really cried. it still hurts a lot so sorry if this typing is off, i'm too lazy to fix it.

so um andy called and was like i can't come or whatever so i was like okay considering a million others couldn't/just didn't show up. so we just danced about taking pictures, singing brand new, singing eisley and like being freaks. we had like pizza and then andy called and was like ya i'm coming! so i was trying to give directions but i am so retarded at that so i was like heh.. where do i live.. heh... so then ummm he finally got there and everyone was like "".."" because the party was basically lived through considering every balloon was popped and everything fun was used up. not to mention there was silly string all over the living room walls lmao. but we had fun anyways and had cake and people sung happy birthday to me and i sung to myself because i rule andddd yeah then people started going home.

i really stand very confused on something and it's obvious for those who i talk to lmao :-/ i don't know though. whatever.

the best part i would have to say is when we all stood out in the rain (well michala, melissa, andy, dana and me) and we were huddling because it was freezing and we were all just laughing and whining about how cold it was.. but none of us went inside. i think it was so funny because no matter how any of us yell at each other and say i hate you or you're annoying or argue about anberlin (lmao michala) we stick by each other.

"event","well i didn't go to school today because i'm not really feeling well and i'm really stressed out. my party is this weekend (saturday) and i really have no idea what i'm gonna do cause it's supposed to rain apparently, and some people are saying it's not gonna. so like if i put everything inside, watch it like be a sunny happy day and if i move it out.. watch it rain. i'll probably just be on the safe side and set up the inside but there's like nobody home to help me which really sucks ass. i probably won't go to school tomorrow because i'm still not feeling too good and i have a thousand things to do. god, i hope people actually come to this stupid party.

in other news i'm putting myself on a little diet. just because i really need to eat healthy, i'm not only getting really fat but feeling really gross eating all the junk stuff i do. right now i'm not too concerned because i'm having surgery in a few months and if i lose weight now i'll just gain it all back while i'm a cripple and can't do anything. so basically i'm just going to start eating healthier and then after my surgery it's off to the gym! plus this weekend there's gonna be so much junk food.

i hope everybody has gotten me amazing presents :)"

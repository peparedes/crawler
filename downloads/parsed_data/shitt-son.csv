whitney is right. i am so not ready to be a senior. to think this time next year will be the last time i will see some of the people that i have been in school with my whole life. it's kind of scary. makes me nervous.

little pieces of the nothing that fall
put your arms around me

jason comes home in 2 days yayyy! and carly is home now... yayyy! carly and megan both work in ice cream places so im officially going for ice cream every time they work :-d speaking of megan she is like one of the coolest people ever. me and her went to brandon's game tonite and bonded. so hopefully we'll hang out alot more :-) 





our speaker today was amazing and everything he said was so true. the way that guys view girls is sad but as much as we dont want to admit it, it's the truth. at least the majority of it. and it made me realize so much about myself and the respect that i need to have for myself more. but it also made me realize how far ive come and how much better i am for everything that has happened to me. so i think i def am going to make an effort to realize my self worth. and to all the girls who were with me today (especially someone who was upset... u know who u r) you are all so beautiful and worthwhile! i love you all and even though this might sound corny it's true!

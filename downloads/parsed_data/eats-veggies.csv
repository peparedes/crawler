"event","Today I&#39;m brewing a BIAB all-grain batch based on a recipe for Reissdorf Kolsch I found in the book <u>Beer Captured.</u>

Here is my Recipe and Pro
This is for a 3 Gallon Batch

4.35 Gallons Water to start with

4.5lb German 2 Row Pilsner
.75 lb &nbsp;German Wheat
&nbsp;.5 lb Munich Malt 10L

Mash Step 1: Brought water to 126F and added grain to bag in pot - let rest at &nbsp;122F for 20 minutes
Mash Step 2: Brought water to 148F and let rest for 90 minutes 
Mash Step 3: Brought water up to 168F and let rest for 10 minutes

Removed grain and squeezed as much as possitble out.

Took a pre-boil Hydrometer Reading: 1.04 and Refractometer Reading: 12.5 brix

Brought water up to the 3.96 gallon mark in the pot and brought to a boil

Boiled 60 minutes

Hop Schedule:  
.75 oz Tettnanger 4.0 at 60 minutes &nbsp;then .
.30 oz Cascade at 15 minutes
1 tsp Irish Moss at 15 minutes then
.30 oz Cascade at Flameout 

Post boil Hydrometer Reading: 1.062 and Refractometer Reading: 14.5

Icebath cooled in order to conserve water (besides, it&#39;s summer - the hose water is about as warm as the wort) &nbsp;I was going to to No Chill, but I am leaving on vacation tomorrow - so I wanted to get this into the fermenter today.

Pitched the yeast I saved from the previous batch Wyeast 1007 German Ale

Batch went into the fermentation chamber at 63F"

"event","Wow, the past week has been a real roller coaster ride. &nbsp;Three events/issues in the news have citizens at each others throats.

1.) &nbsp;A senseless murder of nine innocents in a church in the south incites a huge outrage about the Confederate Battle Flag. &nbsp;First it starts out being about why this flag is being flown on government property - then it escalates into what seems like a call to erase all memory of Confederate leaders, flags, etc. from existence. &nbsp;To be honest, this is kind of par for the course in our country - but I am really noticing it because I find myself on the &quot;unpopular&quot; side of the rage. I don&#39;t have any reason whatsoever to defend the Confederate Flag or the flying of it. &nbsp;I don&#39;t actually condone flying the Confederate flag on government property - but I think it should be up to the citizens of Charleston or state of South Carolina to decide. &nbsp;I&#39;ve spent a lot of time really digging down and thinking about why I am not feeling the rage and indignation that so many others are. &nbsp;I&#39;m not from the south - I don&#39;t even have southern roots (except that I like country music). My niece Jerrica and I batted this around a little - and she helped me sort it out a little. &nbsp;I think I tend to kind of romanticize or get too touchy feely regarding the Civil War based on books I&#39;ve read and movies I&#39;ve seen. &nbsp;Here is an example - Cold Mountain. &nbsp;I am seeing my bias, but my ignorance isn&#39;t allowing me to feel the outrage others are feeling. &nbsp;I&#39;m going to continue to think about this, and I&#39;m going to try and follow the debate with an open mind. &nbsp;Maybe my views will bend a little. &nbsp;(as a side note - I can&#39;t help wondering if the NRA cooked up this major uproar to keep the debate off of gun control legislation.....)

2.) &nbsp;The Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate on the Affordable Care Act. &nbsp;Wow, this really has the anti-Obama people frothing at the mouth. &nbsp;I started out being extremely pro ACA; however, my feelings have changed over the past couple of years due to how the law is being executed. &nbsp;I hope things will improve as time goes by. &nbsp;Right now, if you are working poor - you get screwed with this legislation. &nbsp;I see the law as giving the insurance companies the ability to screw you over big time. &nbsp;How I know this is that it happened to me. &nbsp;I dropped my coverage I was paying $400 a month for because I could not find a single doctor in my location that would take my coverage. &nbsp;I will try again next year. &nbsp;I would much prefer Medicare for all if we are all going to be required to participate.

3.) &nbsp;The Supreme Court ruled that same sex marriage will be legal in all states. &nbsp;The religious conservatives are beside themselves, and the rest of us are doing cartwheels. &nbsp;It&#39;s sad that the decision was 5-4. &nbsp;I was glad that the women on the court voted for Love. &nbsp;I&#39;m so proud of our lady justices. &nbsp;I was appalled that Justice Thomas voted against considering he is an African American and well understands the horror of discrimination. &nbsp;I can&#39;t stand that dude anyway - he is always just sitting there like a bump on a log."

"event","Today we drove up to Fredericksburg to pick up some fresh peaches. &nbsp;The freestone varieties are now starting to ripen. &nbsp;While there we stopped by the Wildseed farm and, as luck would have it, we were able to go to Fredericksburg Trade Days (this is held one weekend a month).

One of the booths at Trade Days had an interesting assortment of old cookbooks for sale. &nbsp;I&#39;m not easily impressed when it comes to cookbooks, but I found three that I snatched up. &nbsp;All were hard cover editions, and all were $4 each.

The first was <u>Sunset Magazine Recipe Annual for 1988</u> (the year my daughter was born). &nbsp;I flipped through it before commiting to buy it. &nbsp;I was sold on the sections on fermenting pickles dozens of recipes that appealed to me (Bird Seed Cake, Lemon-Tarragon Sorbet, and a type of dried fruit Rumtof called Beggars in Rum to name a few).

The second was<u> The Creative Cooking Course</u>. &nbsp;I might not have bothered (I have several &quot;encyclopedia&quot; style cooking books), but the editor of this was Charlotte Turgeon who also edited Larousse Gastronomique. She has serious Kitchen Cred,. The retro-ness of this one amuses me, and I think I&#39;m going to enjoy thumbing through it for inspiration.

The third was the best find of all. &nbsp;It&#39;s a Vegetarian cookbook printed in 1924! &nbsp;It&#39;s called <u>Unity Inn Vegetarian Cookbook</u>  It was published by the Unity School of Christianity. &nbsp;Apparently the Unity Inn was a restaurant operated by the school. &nbsp;I was intrigued, and I hit Google for more information. &nbsp;As usual down the Rabbit Hole I went....... when I came up I learned the history of the Restaurant and found a new Religeous Sect I did not know existed before (AND - they have a church in my town!!). &nbsp;I never bore of how the Universe finds ways to reach out to me.

It&#39;s after 3:30am, so I won&#39;t elaborate on my Unity research. &nbsp;I do plan to read more and report back in my journal. &nbsp;Fascinating stuff!"

"event","This was a BIAB batch This was my first &quot;No Chill&quot; batch

My goal with this batch is to make an &quot;easy drinking&quot; non-threatening homebrew for my friends. My group of peers tend to be Bud Light and Miller Lite drinkers. They don&#39;t appreciate more sophisticated styles, and they really don&#39;t seem to want to. Instead of having hurt feelings that my brewing efforts aren&#39;t appreciated by people other than my husband, I decided to try and brew some things that my friends would like.

Kolsch is an ale exclusively brewed in Cologne Germany. It is lightly fruity/floral and tastes a lot like a lager. It is probably my favorite style of beer when it is made by someone who understands the style and can brew it properly (it&#39;s not an easy brew). I honestly haven&#39;t consumed one brewed in the U.S. that passed muster. Sunner Kolsch is my favorite German Kolsch (sadly there is an issue with importing it - so getting one that isn&#39;t out of date is kind of hard).

I don&#39;t call my brew a Kolsch since there are a few things about it that are very un-Kolsch like. First of all I am not using a dedicated Kolsch yeast. I&#39;m using the <a href=""https://www.wyeastlab.com/hb_yeaststrain_detail.cfm?ID=150"">Wyeast German Ale 1007 yeast</a>. It wasn&#39;t my preference, but got my yeast at the local homebrew shop instead of mail order due to the time of the year (I didn&#39;t want my yeast dying in the heat in transport). The 1007 was the only yeast close to what I wanted. Also, I&#39;m using 1 ounce of Fuggles hops in my recipe. There isn&#39;t a real reason for this except that I was one ounce short on hops - and this was the only one I had that would work.

Here is the recipe

10lb Pilsner Malt (German)
.50lb German Munich Malt
1 ounce Fuggles Hops (added at 60 minutes)
1 ounce Saphir Hops (added at 30 minutes)
9 gallons of water (my recipe asked for 9.16, and I wished I would have trusted it because I came up just short of 5 gallons in the fermenter)

This was the first time I did a 5 gallon BIAB batch. I usually do 3 gallons. It was a little tricky. My boil pot wasn&#39;t big enough, so I had to mash and boil 2 gallons on the stove. Kind of a pain, but it was doable.

I mashed at 147 for 90 minutes - brought the wort back up to 160 then strained all the grains.

I boiled 90 minutes adding hops per the recipe.

At the end of the boil I poured the wort into a No Chill &quot;Jerry Can&quot; and sealed it pushing out as much air as possible.

Left the wort in the container overnight to cool down.

The next day I racked the wort into the fermenting bucket, pitched the yeast, and aerated the wort.

It is currently fermenting at 62F in the fermentation chamber - I would go lower but I&#39;m also fermenting my Loquat Mead in that chamber, and I don&#39;t want to crash it since it is fermenting with Champagne yeast.

Sadly I forgot to take Hydrometer readings. I&#39;m really mad at myself for this. I guess with the new procedures (5 gallon batch, new type of yeast, no chill process) it slipped my mind. This is really going to screw up my calculations for ABV, but it is what it is :-/

June `19, 2015 - &nbsp;Bottled today. &nbsp;Netted equivalent of 46 twelve ounce bottles. &nbsp;The bottles went directly into the refrigerator for &quot;lagering&quot;. &nbsp;I&#39;m kind of wondering if carbonation will take place at these temps. &nbsp;Maybe I should have lagered before bottling since it is an ale yeast. &nbsp;The reason I didn&#39;t is because I still have Mead in the fermentation chamber, and it would hav crashed had I dropped to lagering temps. &nbsp;Well, this is all a learning process so..... &nbsp;Side notes: &nbsp;I saved the yeast from the batch. I&#39;m going to brew al Altbier when I get back from New England (which will give me enough time to get it fermented and bottled before leaving for Germany Sept 1st). &nbsp;I tasted the finished beer - definitely NOT a Kolsch; however, it was mighty tasty even before any lagering etc. &nbsp;Super excited to see what we get in a month.  

June 27, 2015 &nbsp;- &nbsp;Began tasting today. &nbsp;I was just curious to see what&#39;s up not expecting even carbonation since the beer is now under refrigeration. &nbsp;Well, the carbonation was there. &nbsp;So was a kind of strange boiled egg like aroma. &nbsp;I am not sure if this is the yeast or an infection. &nbsp;The beer is drinkable, but the aroma is not really pleasant. &nbsp;It is possible that this aroma will fade as the yeast cleans things up since the live yeast is still in the bottles to some extent. &nbsp;Will be tracking it.&nbsp;"

"event","<p>Tomorrow is the last day of May; it seemed to just fly by. &nbsp;This month we had loads of rain. &nbsp;This was good for us, but our neighbors in San Marcos and Wimberly good clobbered. &nbsp;Houston and Dallas has had it&#39;s share of the wetness as well. &nbsp;They say, as of today, it has rained enough to put the entire state under 8 inches of water. &nbsp;I hope everyone&#39;s water table is where it should be for this year as a result.</p>

This month I have made some healthy changes and seem to be sticking to it. &nbsp;I vowed to severely cut back on my diet soda consumption and begin walking regularly. &nbsp;Both are going good.

My walking routine took off once I downloaded and started using an app called Map my Fitness which records your fitness activity via GPS. &nbsp;It maintains a record and allows you to share each walk via social media. &nbsp;This is motivating by itself, but companies can also sponsor challenges you can sign up for in the app where you can shoot for prizes when you complete their objectives.

I made a &quot;no bottled soda&quot; rule in my house, and I bought a Sodastream system to make soda by the liter as needed. &nbsp;This one change really helped me to cut back on my soda. &nbsp;I am no longer even buying diet cola syrup for the Sodastream. &nbsp;I&#39;m making tea instead. &nbsp;I still will have a diet soda occasionally, but I am making sure it&#39;s the exception to the rule.

We&#39;ve been harvesting A LOT this month, and as a result have been busy putting stuff up either canning or freezing

<span style=""font-size:1.4em;""><b>FAVA BEANS</b></span>
We wanted to leave the beans on the plants to let them dry naturally, but all the rain forced us to harvest and seed them ahead of time. &nbsp;Marcel sauteed them in butter and garlic, and we thoroughly enjoyed them. &nbsp;Next year I will grow a lot more!

We were so happy to have a nice Zucchini harvest this year. &nbsp;The Squash Vine Borers finally got to them (we knew it was only a matter of time), but we harvested about 20+ pounds before that happened. &nbsp;Next year I will get even a bigger jump on the season by putting out starts instead of direct seeding. &nbsp;I will also be much more vigilant about scraping any and all vine borer eggs.

To put up Zucchini for use later in Zucchini Bread and Meat Loaf I grated and dehydrated - then stored the dried result in canning jars on the shelf. &nbsp;I will report back once I&#39;ve tried using it reconstituted.

This month we also completed a little project to create a BBQ space in our back yard. &nbsp;We did the ground work. &nbsp;Next up we buy a grill and a picnic table. &nbsp;We are going to buy one of those picnic table kits from Amazon.com where you get the hardware and you buy your own wood. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t really save any money, but it allows us to make the table more custom. &nbsp;I also want to do some outdoor string lighting or something to make it look festive. &nbsp;This is something I&#39;ve always wanted to do, so glad Marcel is helping me accomplish it. (p.s. - I know it looks l ike he is doing all the work, but he&#39;s totally NOT lol - - it was shared equally - - he just never takes pictures, so I have to always be the one behind the camera) :-)

"event","A few weeks ago I (with some help from Marcel and my niece Jerrica) harvested Loquats from a tree my friend has in her backyard and the tree of her neighbor down the street. &nbsp;This is a first for me. &nbsp;While I see these trees all the time in our area, I&#39;ve never tasted the fruit. &nbsp;The fruit also are not for sale at the supermarket for some reason. &nbsp;It seems like, while lots of people have these trees, nobody is very keen on harvesting and eating the fruit.

Loquats have the texture of a firm grape and the taste is a combination of grape/lemon/apple. &nbsp;They are the size of a jumbo grape with a firm skin (kind of th like the skin on a passionfruit. &nbsp;They have large seeds inside - usually two...sometimes one or three. &nbsp;They skin tannins will stain your fingers kind of like the husks of pecans will do if you aren&#39;t careful.  

I processed the fruit by peeling and seeding it. &nbsp;What a HUGE PAIN IN THE BUTT.  

The first thing I made was a few pints of preserves. &nbsp;Then I was going to make juice from the rest, but&nbsp;I finally decided I would make a batch of Mead with the juice (I think Mead made with honey and fruit is a Melomel - or something like that).

Here is how I did it (this is my own recipe adapted from a basic Mead recipe)

Batch Size 2.5 gallons

Ingredients

1 gallon and 16 ounces of juice from Loquats
5 pounds (80 ounces) Honey
80 ounces water
1 Campton Tablet
1/2 tsp Yeast Nutrient (I will be adding more nutrients as the fermentation continues)

To juice the Loquats I ran them through a food processer and then strained through a jelly bag. &nbsp;I thought about just fermenting the pulb puree, but I didn&#39;t want to have to keep a super close eye on it while it ferments - the juice won&#39;t require constant monitoring.

I added the campton tablet to the juice as I was making it

I heated the honey just enough to make it very fluid then I added the juice. &nbsp;I let it all cool down to room temp.

While waiting for it to come to room temp I dissolved the yeast in a little water to get it ready to add to the must.

After adding the must to the fermenter I rocked it to add oxygen.

I pitched the yeast and added 1/2 tsp yeast nutrient.

I am going to put it in the Fermentation Chamber at 68F for now. &nbsp;I will be doing a Koelsch beer in the next few days and when I put that in the chamber I&#39;ll lower the temp to 66F."

"event","I feel like I want to mark the passing of my cat Cyber with a journal post dedicated to her.

Cyber came into my family in the summer of 1997. &nbsp;I&#39;d recently moved to Japan to work for MWR, and I wanted to surprise my daughter Sierra with a kitten when she came to join me around Christmas that year.

Cyber was always Cyber - even as a kitten. &nbsp;By that I mean not overly playfull; definitely independent. &nbsp;She was like a roomate (who didn&#39;t want to be bothered too much). &nbsp;We still adored her regardless of her lack of kitty cat personality.

While living in Japan Cyber&#39;s home was our 3LDK Mansion apartment. &nbsp;She was predominately an indoor kitty, but she slipped by us and out the door occasionally. &nbsp;This wasn&#39;t really a big deal to us until one day she didn&#39;t return. &nbsp;I think she was gone almost 4 months when she returned not too worse for wear (she was missing a tooth). She never strayed again.

In 2004 we moved back to the United States, and Cyber came with us. &nbsp;The base vet perscribed her some sedatives for the trip. &nbsp;She traveled under my seat in her carrier, and she was a real trooper. &nbsp;I already owned my house when we got to Texas; we just didn&#39;t have any furniture in it yet. &nbsp;Cyber went from cat carrier to the top of the shower stall of the master bedroom after being turned loose. &nbsp;She stayed there for a long time.

We got dogs shortly after we moved to Texas. &nbsp;This didn&#39;t make Cyber very happy, and there were some tense moments. &nbsp;She got through them though. &nbsp;We kept the dogs outside and Cyber inside. &nbsp;For the most part everyone learned to live together.

When Marcel came along in 2009 Cyber was skeptical. &nbsp;She retreated to her safe place (above the hot water heater in the laundry room) for the first few weeks after he started visiting. &nbsp;Eventually she would stay in the same room. &nbsp;Then she would allow him to pet her. &nbsp;Then she would jump into his lap. After we married I was still living in New Braunfels and Marcel was commuting from the coast up to me every week. &nbsp;The plan was, eventually, for me to move down to be with him. &nbsp;Since I couldn&#39;t be with him - I sent Cyber down to live with him. &nbsp;They formed a nice bond when that happened.

We noticed in the past 5 years that she was &quot;showing her age&quot;. &nbsp;You could tell she was moving slower and it took her longer and longer to find a comfortable place to lay down. &nbsp;In 2014 she developed quite a serious infection in her eyes. &nbsp;We struggled with it back and forth until finally I asked the vet to remove them (she was already blind by that time). &nbsp;Once the surgery was done she gained weight and was coping fairly well. Not long after this we sold the restaurant and moved to the house in New Braunfels. &nbsp;She came with of course, and she was doing fairly well considering her age and blindness. &nbsp;She slept most of the time only getting up from her bed to eat and poop. &nbsp;Still - she was doing okay.

Then the infections returned. &nbsp;The vet perscribed two antibiotics, and we kept her on them for two weeks. &nbsp;No change. &nbsp;Because her eyes were goine - the area just above her eye swelled up. &nbsp;She was not a happy camper. &nbsp;After getting the advice of the vet - we made the decision to let her go. &nbsp;We didn&#39;t want her final weeks to be miserable. &nbsp;We held her while the sedative was administered and she was relaxing, and we held were both there when they gave the final injection.

I felt sad, but I also felt like she was still with us in spirit. &nbsp;We buried her under the fig tree in front of the garden shed. &nbsp;I am going to make a market stone for the little plot.

We are feeling very empty at the moment - we have constant reminders since she used to live in our bedroom. &nbsp;We are both okay though - we know she is where she is supposed to be.

This is just a journal post to honor her memory :-)

I didn&#39;t think Marcel would like this because he doesn&#39;t like KimChi. &nbsp;He did like this batch which I only fermented 24 hours. I&#39;m hoping I can allow future batches to ferment longer on the counter and keep feeding it to him to encourage his taste buds to adjust. &nbsp;I like well fermented &quot;chi&quot; - provided the pepper heat isn&#39;t through the roof.

<span style=""font-size:1.8em;"">Chard-Chi</span>
makes approx 1 quart (after 24 hours initial fermentation)
<img height=""268"" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5443/17395427128_363d559388_z.jpg"" style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px; float: right;"" width=""200"" />2 lb &nbsp; Swiss Chard Ribs (very coarsley chopped)
2 tsp &nbsp;Salt
<div>2 tsp &nbsp;Sesame Oil
<div>2 tsp &nbsp;Soy Sauce
2 tsp &nbsp;Sugar
4 tbsp Garlic, minced</div><div>2 tbsp Ginger, dried
(because we had a bunch of it on hand - it was a little aged which is why we used so much. This is probably a good quantity for minced fresh ginger which we will use when our stash of powdered ginger is gone)
1 tbsp Red Pepper Flakes (again - we had a bunch of this on hand)
<div>** You really should sanitize all bowls, jars, lids, and utensils when making this since there is no cooking involved. &nbsp;This ensures there are little or no competing bacteria which would cause spoilage. &nbsp;You can do this by boiling in water for a few minutes or using a sanitizer like Star-San etc. &nbsp;(I don&#39;t recommend bleach solution only because I don&#39;t think it does a very good job; however, if that is all you have - use it).

<img height=""268"" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5338/17583251535_f5b99fbb5b_z.jpg"" style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px; float: right;"" width=""200"" />You are basically just mixing all the ingredients together well in a large bowl then transferring to a large jar (or several small) to ferment over night. &nbsp;Cover the jars with something that breathes like cheesecloth or muslin during this process.</div><div>
After the 24 hours the volume of the Char-Chi will be quite a bit less. &nbsp;You now have choices.....

You can eat it now. &nbsp;It&#39;s going to have a fresh salad taste. It won&#39;t really taste fermented, but it&#39;s delicious

You can transfer it into smaller jars, seal with sterilized lids, and refrigerate. &nbsp;It may continue to ferment slightly, but I doubt it will change much.  

You can let it stay on the counter for another day (or multiple days) tasting it as it ferments along. &nbsp;You then refrigerate it when it reaches the taste you like. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure if this lessens the storage time in the refrigerator or not. &nbsp;I&#39;m going to test longevity in future batches (I doubt this one will last two weeks).

"event","Today was a very eventful day (and it&#39;s not over yet).

Well, beginning at midnight - it is Marcel&#39;s and my 6th wedding anniversary. &nbsp;It really snuck up on us. &nbsp;We aren&#39;t big into celebrating every occasion, but it reminded us of the day we married (it was on a Wednesday just like today). &nbsp;We seem like such an old married couple - it just doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s only been 6 years.

This morning, first thing, we took our 17 year old cat Cyber for a return visit to the vet. &nbsp;We&#39;ve been treating her with medication to try and calm down a scary swelling around her right eye socket. &nbsp;I wasn&#39;t posting on LJ when cyber first began having trouble about a year ago. &nbsp;She developed a horrible infection in both eyes. &nbsp;it was complicated - I think park was Glaucoma and then the vet said she had an infection behind the eye sockets. &nbsp;Well, we treated her several sessions to try and control it to no avail. &nbsp;Finally I asked the vets to remove her eyes (she was blind at this point anyway). &nbsp;She did, and Cyber recovered (or so we thought). &nbsp;About 8 months later the inflamation returned in a different way - I would swear it was a tumor, but it&#39;s still unknown. &nbsp;The vet had us giving her two types of antibiotics twice a day for two weeks. &nbsp;No result. &nbsp;She was already fairly frail and thin - and this was slowly taking more of a toll on her. &nbsp;At the return appointment the vet layed out the options. &nbsp;We considered them, but in the end we opted to have her put to sleep. &nbsp;We buried her under the fig tree on the property. &nbsp;She was a tough cookie - she was my companion for all my years in Japan as well as Texas - learned to love Marcel - and moved to the coast AND back with us. &nbsp;It&#39;s going to be weird around here without her.

My niece Jerrica passed her online Adult Driver&#39;s course this afternoon. &nbsp;This will give her a certificate to show the Texas DMV - so she can skip the written test and get her learner&#39;s permit immediately. &nbsp;Once it comes in the mail we will get that going.

Today is WET - &nbsp;soggy and wet. &nbsp;We are still grateful we aren&#39;t on the coast where there is some scary flooding going on. &nbsp;We are all inside today. &nbsp;I&#39;m tending to my journal and photo collection. &nbsp;Jerrica finished her Driver&#39;s class and is watching &quot;Pickers&quot; on the television (at least there is someone to actually watch the TV now lol), and Marcel is making Blackberry Jam. &nbsp;Later we hope to go out to dinner to celebrate the highs and lows of life I guess.&nbsp;"

"event","We now have a farm truck. We weren&#39;t intending to buy a truck until next year, but life happened. :-)

My niece, the daughter of my sister Zoe who recently passed away, came to live with us. She has not been out on her own yet, so we are going to try and help her become independent. She is 25, but she has not ever had a driver&#39;s license. Naturally, this is the first order of business. Well, Marcel said a big NO to letting her practice in his BMW - - and it seemed silly to buy a car just to have her practice in. We really did need a truck (lots of work going on at the Bauernhof) - so we went about searching.

We started with the used car classifieds, but this made both of us uneasy. We didn&#39;t want to go to a dealership and get &quot;played&quot;, so we pulled up the CarMax app - and we were able to find exactly what we needed. A single cab truck with an 8 foot bed, and a trailer hitch :-) It&#39;s big and has a big engine, but we will really only be using it for farm work (and teaching Jerrica how to drive). Heck, once she learns on this baby - she&#39;ll be able to drive pretty much anything :-)

"event","Going to start recording garden notes again now that I&#39;m back on Livejournal. &nbsp;Past notes over the years proved to be so helpful when I needed data.

This year the data may be skewed because of the wet spring we had. &nbsp;(I need to make a post with thoughts about this year compared to my first &quot;magic&quot; year in this garden - - it&#39;s a memory I want to keep)

******************************
Noticed in the garden today:

Cucumbers and Pole Beans are flowering (Marcel said he saw the beginnings of beans on some of the vines)

Lettuce is starting to falter. &nbsp;Looks like the Batva is going strong, the Oak Leaf Salad Bowl still good - but can tell it&#39;s a matter of time, the Romaine has had it.

Tomatoes still flowering and fruiting. &nbsp;Might have some ripe maters in a week. &nbsp;I need to &quot;treat&quot; them with more epsom salt this week. &nbsp;With all the rain we&#39;ve had - they might be running low on magnesium to prevent blossom end rot.

All my flowering perennials are flowering except the yarrow. &nbsp;I have not seen a bee on any of them yet, but they are all still rather small. &nbsp;I know the bees are here because they have polinated the vegetable garden and the blackberries.

Speaking of blackberries - blossoming is over, and now we have lots of starter berries on the canes.  

Many Many blooms on the Pomegranate trees

Summer Squash are still flourishing. &nbsp;Both yellow and green have blooms and small fruit. &nbsp;I&#39;m awaiting the dreaded vine borer death wilt any day now - - or will I be passed over this year? &nbsp;If I am passed over, is it a fluke or did my aggressive mulching work? &nbsp;These are things I lose sleep over.....

*****************************************************
Today I planted black eyed peas in the following locations:

Soaked for about an hour: &nbsp;1st Row Right side main garden &amp; Flower Bed closest to Play House

Unsoaked: &nbsp;1st Row left side

In order to make room to plant the beans I had to harvest quite a bit of lettuce out of the rows. &nbsp;I brought it over to my neighbor Jerry - he has lots of friends that he can share them with. &nbsp;He, in return, gave me some deer stew meat, deer sausage, and pork sausage. &nbsp;Awesome!  

*****************************************************
Most evenings Marcel and I end the day sitting on the swing under the tree. &nbsp;Right now it&#39;s hard to get up and go into the house because the fireflies (lightening bugs?) are EVERYWHERE. &nbsp;It&#39;s like being in a Disney movie. &nbsp;I love that Marcel appreciates these little things as much as I do (probably more). &nbsp;I wonder if the heavy amounts of rain we&#39;ve had has something to do with the population?"

"event","This is really just a batch I did in order to further use the ingredients sitting in the beer fridge.

I originally bought the wheat malt to make a Hefeweisen, but I never did. &nbsp;I can&#39;t now because I don&#39;t have the proper yeast.

I don&#39;t think the Beer Gods were with me on this one because I made process mistake after mistake. &nbsp;I will be grateful if this beer ends up infection free. &nbsp;Especially since I cooled the wort in the bathtub - and was stupid enough to get some of the cooling water into the wort (I don&#39;t even want to explain how that happened).

Here are the ingredients and the process in case it actually comes out good :-)

Dried Light Malt Extract &nbsp;2 lb (I added 3 additional ounces after the boil to bring the OG up to what the recipe predicts)

Canadian Wheat Malt &nbsp;2 lb

Crystal Malt 70/80 &nbsp;12 ounces

Perle Hops .50 oz &nbsp;60 min

Perle Hops .50 oz &nbsp;15 min

Muntons Ale yeast (dry)

Using BIAB method I mashed the grains 60 minutes at approx 148F - then raised to 160F and set 7 minutes. &nbsp;Removed grains (squeezed as much wort out as possible) - brought wort up to a boil. &nbsp;At this time I added the DME and first hops. &nbsp;Added the 2nd hops with 15 minutes left. &nbsp;At the end of the boil I took a refractometer reading, and it showed I was a little shy of the estimated original gravity. &nbsp;I added 3 more ounces of DME.

Due to poor planning I ended up cooling my wort in the bath tub (comedy of errors involing not remembering to check prior to brewing that I had enough cooling ice bottles, the chilling coils were leaking, and the kitchen sink too small to use the 5 gallon pot - not necessarily in that order).

While wort cooling I rehydrated the yeast &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After cooling I rocked the carboy for aeration then added yeast, bung, airlock.

Original Gravity Brix 13 (1.053)

May 17th - bottling today from primary. &nbsp;Shooting for carbonation volume of 3.5. &nbsp;Used 4.25 ounces of corn sugar for priming.

Ending Hydrometer reading: 1.02 &nbsp;(abv calc: 4.3%) &nbsp; &nbsp; Ending Refractometer reading: 7.5 &nbsp;(abv 4.95 estimate)

Batch probably has an Alcohol By Volume contest of 4.5% (I was shooting for 5.4%, but I&#39;m not disappointed - taste is more important; we&#39;ll have to wait and see how the final batch tastes)

Beer pre-bottling tastes&nbsp;"

"event","We were blessed with rain this spring. &nbsp;We had yet more last night. &nbsp;Halleluja!
Rain means so much to me since how the plant life on the homestead fares is much influenced. &nbsp;There is a difference between rain water and well or city water. &nbsp;Rain water is not processed or treated, and it is designed by nature to hydrate life (mammals drink it - plants absorb it).

The homestead garden is looking gorgeous. &nbsp;We&#39;ve harvested a huge amount of lettuce, radishes, and swiss chard. &nbsp;The summer squash, peppers, and tomatoes got a massive early boost. &nbsp;The blackberries, grapes, and fruit trees also have hit the ground running. &nbsp;EVERYTHING is just flourishing!

This spring we discovered that we have five total Mulberry trees. &nbsp;I knew I had the one over the chicken coop. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t even know I had that one until about 3 years ago. &nbsp;A couple weeks ago Marcel was walking the property perimeter and found the others along the fenceline. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know how I/we missed them before because they aren&#39;t babies - they must be several years old. &nbsp;My only thought is that they started producing fruit when we were down in Corpus Christi. &nbsp;Well, however it happened - we are thrilled. &nbsp;We collected enough to make a few pints of Mulberry Jam. &nbsp;Next year I am going to make syrup to add to water for drinking.

My friend Bea has a Loquat tree. &nbsp;We harvested a lot from it and processed them into juice. &nbsp;We froze it for now. &nbsp;Not sure whether we want to make syrup or wine from it. &nbsp;Loquats grow well here, and many folks have them in their yard. &nbsp;We are deciding whether we want to grow one or simply barter with people who have them already.

Marcel and I both share the same feeling inside right now - it&#39;s a blend of happiness, gratitude, enthusiasm, and a general feeling of well-being. Not just about the good weather. &nbsp;About everything. &nbsp;It&#39;s not that things are perfect. &nbsp;There are still daily challenges and setbacks. &nbsp;It just feels like we&#39;ve arrived at where we are supposed to be in life. &nbsp;We are both looking forward to the future.

"event","It&#39;s been several months since I brewed last. &nbsp;Now that we are settled back in somewhat, I feel like I can take on brewing some batches. &nbsp;I still had odd quantities of malt, hops, and yeast - so I am creating some recipes that will use most of it up. I will be able to get two 3 gallon batches I think.

I did the first batch yesterday. &nbsp;It&#39;s a Brown Ale modified from a Brown Ale I did previuosly. &nbsp;The modified recipe uses the same weight of grains, but the makeup of the grains is somewhat different. &nbsp;The hops are different. &nbsp;The yeast the same.

The previous batch only gave me an actual final ABV of 3.1 even though the recipe on paper estimated I would get a 6.8%. &nbsp;The previous batch was sluggish in fermentation I remember, but I couldn&#39;t find another reason for the discrepancy. &nbsp;It remains to be seen what this batch will do.

RECIPE

Batch Size 3 gallons

3 lb &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 Row Pale Malt
2 lb &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 Row German Pilsner Malt
1 lb &nbsp; &nbsp; Caravienne Malt
1 lb &nbsp; &nbsp; Munich Malt
3 oz &nbsp; &nbsp; Black Barley Malt
.5 oz &nbsp; &nbsp;Crystal Hops (in at 15 min)
.12 oz &nbsp;Chinook Hops (in at 60 min)
.12 oz &nbsp;Styrian Goldings Hops (in at 60 min)
.12 oz &nbsp;Willamette Hops (at flameout)
1 Pkt &nbsp; &nbsp;Safale US-05

ORIGINAL GRAVITY REFRACTOMETER 11 BRIX (1.044 specific gravity)
ORIGINAL GRAVITY HYDROMETER 1.05 specific gravity
(note: forgot to do the reading and did it the next day with the leftover trube - so I am guessing the refractomter OG reading is more accurate)

Notes:

4/16/15 &nbsp;Brew Day &nbsp;- &nbsp;see above for recipe and readings. &nbsp;Note that I chilled using a combination of coil chiller and sanitized frozen 1 liter bottles. &nbsp;I &quot;rocked&quot; to aerate. &nbsp;I let the yeast bloom in water before adding to wurt. &nbsp;Primary fermentation is in a 3 gallon carboy. &nbsp;Wow, this wort is CLOUDY - yikes! &nbsp;Hope it settles out.

4/17/15 &nbsp;There is activity in the airlock. &nbsp;Next Check in about a week (unless something out of the ordinary happens)

4/25/15 &nbsp;All is going well. &nbsp;Beer is settling out nicely. &nbsp;Airlock is silent. &nbsp;I did not need to install a blow off tube even though the Krausen came right on up to the top. &nbsp;I kept a close eye on it. &nbsp;I plan to leave well enough alone. &nbsp;I don&#39;t plan to rack this beer to a secondary. &nbsp;I&#39;m going to let it go 3 weeks in primary then bottle. &nbsp;I&#39;ll take a reading and record at bottling time.

5/7/14 &nbsp; Bottled today. &nbsp;Had some issues with the capper and my german bottles. Thank goodness there were lots of Flensburger bottles handy. &nbsp;Final gravity 1.012 on the Hydrometer. &nbsp;Refractometer showing 5. &nbsp;Alcohol by volume approx 5.1 give or take. &nbsp;The beer tastes good - I&#39;m looking forward to seeing how it carbonates (used corn sugar as usual). &nbsp;This isn&#39;t a true brown ale - it&#39;s too light (color, mouthfeel); however, I think it&#39;s going to be good drinking.

5/30/15 &nbsp;First taste today. &nbsp;Carbonated nicely. &nbsp;Head is creamy and long standing. &nbsp;Color is good for a Brown Ale. &nbsp;The yeast settled out nicely (US-05 never seems to disappoint) - the beer is clear. &nbsp;Flavor ...... &nbsp;First of all it tastes good. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t taste like a brown ale though. &nbsp;It&#39;s more clean and the Crystal and Chinook hops are on the nose and palate (which probably overpowers any maltiness?). &nbsp;I like it though! &nbsp;"

"event","I recently made a &quot;from the hip&quot; gallon of what I call Hard Gingerale. &nbsp;I say &quot;from the hip&quot; because I didn&#39;t measure or record anything. &nbsp;I remember thin slicing ginger and putting it in the pot with an unknown quantity of sugar, a few squirts of lemon juice (to add some acid), and the leftover half pack of yeast from the last batch of beer (a Saison) that I brewed previously.

In the end it came out SPECTACULAR!! - Seriously. &nbsp;I&#39;m kicking myself for not logging my ingredients, quantities, and fermenting procedure. &nbsp;Well, less than one week after it was ready to drink - it&#39;s gone. &nbsp;I&#39;m not a Brew guzzler really - a gallon of brew yields about 9 bottles of brew when all is said and done. &nbsp;I&#39;ll add that the alcohol content on this particular brew was probably around 3%.

Anyway, since most of my homebrew is gone - - I need to make some more. &nbsp;I should be doing this once a week considering my enthusiasm for drinking and sharing it with friends. &nbsp;It takes about 3 weeks from brew day until you can drink the cider-style stuff (cider, hard gingerale, etc.) - and 4-6 weeks for beer.

Yesterday I brewed a German Blonde Ale, and it&#39;s in the fermenter. &nbsp;Today I pitched the leftover yeast from that brew into a gallon of Central Market apple juice and set it up to ferment. &nbsp;Lazy I guess, but I really wanted to see what simply fermenting the basic juice would end up tasting like.

I seem to be brew crazy these days. &nbsp;Marcel and I went out to a brew pub for lunch today (there&#39;s a pic on my FB page), and I tried Porter for the first time. &nbsp;Yum!! &nbsp;Loved it. &nbsp;When dessert came I put some of the vanilla ice cream in a glass and poured some of the porter in. &nbsp;Marcel was like - Yuck!! - then I made him taste it. &nbsp;He is one of those painfully honest types..... he said it was delicious. &nbsp;This might be an upcoming dessert idea if I can figure out how to present it.

It was cold and wet today, but I&#39;m trying to enjoy it. &nbsp;Pretty soon it&#39;s going to be hotter than hades and sticky yucky; I really don&#39;t look forward to dealing with it from mid May through mid October.

"event","I&#39;ve always believed that the Universe sometimes (but not always) gives you things at the very right time. &nbsp;Or is is that that I focused in and paid attention because I was ready..... &nbsp;Either way, when it happens It&#39;s awesome.

I&#39;ve struggled with my spiritual identify my whole life. &nbsp;Every spiritual discipline has value in my opinion. &nbsp;I find myself rejecting and embracing aspects of each.

I&#39;ve never been able to believe in the fundamentals of Christianity though I do believe that Jesus was a great teacher, and the Ten Commandments..... can&#39;t beat those. I love the Psalms, and the bible stories are inspiring and teach important lessons.

My husband and mother were both raised Catholic. &nbsp;I love this Christian Denomination for it&#39;s tradition, and I find their rituals beautiful and interesting. &nbsp;I find it very seductive in a way. &nbsp;I suppose I am jaded when I say I consider all the ritual and materialism in the Catholic church a crutch for the members. &nbsp;That would be a whole other journal entry though. &nbsp;We&#39;ll leave it at - they have it going on; just not for me.

I think the principles of Buddhism make sense, and I have adopted many of them in my daily life. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think I could ever consider myself a Buddhist though. &nbsp;It would be like moving to a foreign country where I could speak the language only conversationally. &nbsp;I am also turned off by a lot of the idolatry in some Buddhist sects.

The Hindu faith has a lot going for it. &nbsp;Their large ideas I love (we are all one), but there are too many various Gods, prayers, etc. &nbsp;It&#39;s too complicated to fully embrace and - like Buddhism - a little too foreign.

I found bliss when I discovered Alan Watts. &nbsp;This is it!!!!! &nbsp;He&#39;s just a philosopher though. &nbsp;He, like me, found real truth (and BS) in a variety of religions. &nbsp;His take was my take though, and I felt supremely connected to him (I think I&#39;ve read and listened to everything the man has ever published).

I&#39;ve always felt a little lost - like there wasn&#39;t a spiritual home for me. &nbsp;I&#39;ve honestly felt like a spiritual outcast unable to share my thoughts with people because they are so different than the norm.

I&#39;m a 51 year old reasonably educated liberal female who has open ears, eyes, and an open mind......

So why
I am honestly wondering
has it taken me so long
to find Unitarian Universalism on my spiritual radar??
(and I wonder what Mr. Watts would think of them - if he ever even mentioned them in any of his talks or books, I don&#39;t remember it)

Nevertheless
I have been giddy with excitement to have discovered this group of religious rebels.

Marcel and I checked out the UU church here, and we very much enjoyed the services we&#39;ve gone to. &nbsp;It&#39;s a friendly service with some of the traditional trappings (greeting your fellow attendees, singing hymns, listening to the sermon, etc.). &nbsp;We&#39;ve had to jet out just after though, so we really haven&#39;t met any of the members.

The restaurant is open on Sundays, so it&#39;s not always possible (well it&#39;s usually not possible) to make a service that begins at 11am. &nbsp;Instead I listen to UU sermons via Podcasts. &nbsp;My favorite is the<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/first-unitarian-universalist/id372427776?mt=2""> First UU of Austin Podcast</a>.

I&#39;m hoping to make time to participate in the UU community and become a member of the church. &nbsp;I just have to carve out free time which is non-existent right now.

Do you all know about Unitarian Universalists? &nbsp;If so, what do you know about them - and what are your impressions. &nbsp;If it&#39;s negative, I certainly want to hear that too, so feel free to be honest :-)"

"event","For those still on my Friend List - I am back (for a trial run any way).

I can&#39;t seem to connect with another blogging service (ie Blogger / Wordpress). &nbsp;Maybe I had been on LJ too long, and I can&#39;t retrain my brainl. &nbsp;I want to record entries but it never seems to happen. &nbsp;I&#39;ve only done a few since leaving LIveJournal.

I do have a paper journal of sorts that I jot down little thoughts and inspirations to, but I feel the need recently to really get some of my thoughts/ideas/feelings onto something.

I&#39;m active on Facebook, and I love the connection of Facebook - it just doesn&#39;t support what I really want to do. &nbsp;It&#39;s great for sharing real life stuff, and I adore staying connected to close friends and family. &nbsp;I just need more.

I need the atmosphere that LJ gave me.  

Today whilst thinking about the situation (It&#39;s come up in my brain several times in the past few months) - I thought....why not just go back to your Eats_Veggies journal?? &nbsp;I don&#39;t know.....why not........good question.

I&#39;ve got a lot of stuff in my head Universe - and I need to express/purge. &nbsp;Seriously.

Nothing is wrong really - I&#39;m just growing! I&#39;m excited! &nbsp;I&#39;m having a mental/spiritual growth spurt! &nbsp;(or is it a mid life crisis without the crisis part)...) &nbsp;I don&#39;t know what to make of it, but it is something important for my personal growth - I know it.

I need a place to help me sort through and make sense of this chapter in my life.

So, I am going to put some effort into re-settling here on LJ. &nbsp;and I&#39;m going to try and post, at least, a couple of times a week.

I plan to post public, friends only, and private. &nbsp;What I don&#39;t know yet, &nbsp;but I know I need to do it.

Hope everyone is well; I am looking forward to connecting with your again!! (and making even more new connections)"

"event","So, I&#39;m finally going to Germany this year. &nbsp;Marcel and I will be in the Black Forest region (where he is from) and will visit &nbsp;the Lake Constance area and Alsace region in France. &nbsp;We&#39;ll be together 2 weeks then he will go home. &nbsp;I plan to stay another week and go to Austria (where my &quot;people&quot; come from). &nbsp;I&#39;m hoping my mother and aunt make the Austria trip (I would take a train and meet them in Vienna) - they should be making the visit even more than I.

Originally I had dreams of visiting Munich and staying in Hostels then going to the Beaujolais area of France and more, but after studying the area and hearing Marcel&#39;s take on it - &nbsp;I realize that is not going to happen. &nbsp;I&#39;d be running here and there and not enjoying any of it.

The highlight of the trip is probably going to be hiking in the Black Forest. &nbsp;There are lots of trails and Inns throughout the area. &nbsp;We will do, at least, a two day hike staying over one night. &nbsp;Then maybe a day hike later.

A close second is going to be the Alsace region of France. &nbsp;I&#39;ve become quite a wine lover since I met Marcel. &nbsp;Especially French wine - I can&#39;t help myself, and I swear it&#39;s not snobbery or anything of the sort. &nbsp;I just love a lot of the French wines. &nbsp;

I&#39;m also looking forward to visiting the town where the Cuckoo clock was invented.&nbsp;

I started studying German as my New Year&#39;s Resolution. &nbsp;I have a year Gold Key membership at LiveMocha.com to help me. &nbsp;I also have some grammar books and recordings. &nbsp;Then there is the live-in Native German speaker who sleeps next to me....... &nbsp;I&#39;m determined to speak with a fair amount of fluency by October.

So, those are my plans anyway. &nbsp;Something to keep me hopeful - it&#39;s always fun to plan.

Anyone else visited Germany? France? Europe? &nbsp;If so, maybe you could make a Journal post about the experience so I can read it (I&#39;m sure other people would be interested too)."

"event","I'm finding it more and more inconvenient to get onto Livejournal these days.&nbsp; When I do, I just read to catch up - rarely posting.&nbsp; Will have to remedy that somehow.&nbsp; Maybe I'll make a weekly appointment or something.<br /><br />What's new.......<br /><br /><span style=""color: #ff6600""><span style=""font-size: larger""><strong>The baby chicks are over 3 weeks old now</strong></span></span>, and we recently moved them to the &quot;halfway coop&quot;.&nbsp; They will stay there a month or more then go to the big coop.&nbsp; We have a couple more of the old flock to put in the pot before this happens.&nbsp; Five of our hens are still laying - they will stay after the new flock moves in.&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong><span style=""color: #993300"">Last week Marcel ordered me a Grain Mill.</span></strong></span>&nbsp; I've been wanting to grind my own grains for a long time now.&nbsp; We did alot of reseach, and we decided&nbsp;The&nbsp;Family Grain Mill&nbsp;was best for us because..... 1 - made in Germany 2 - with the setup we purchased we can grind by hand and also with the Kitchenaid mixer.&nbsp; 3. there are many add ons you can purchase including a motor, roller/flaker, meat grinder, shredder.&nbsp; We shopped around for the best price and found what we wanted for $149.99 with free shipping from Millersgrainhouse.com.&nbsp; It arrived today (so FedEx says......I'm here at work).<br /><br />With the new mill I can make flour and cracked grain for the chickens (and cooked cereals).&nbsp; <span style=""font-size: small""><strong><span style=""color: #808000"">Now we need whole grains to mill</span></strong></span><strong><span style=""font-size: larger""><span style=""color: #808000"">.</span></span></strong><span style=""color: #808000"">&nbsp; </span>We&nbsp;bought&nbsp;25# of rye&nbsp;and a couple pounds of wheat locally, but it is a&nbsp;little&nbsp;pricey.&nbsp; We researched and found that there is a Co-Op that orders twice a year from Waltonfeed.com.&nbsp; Doing it with others saves a bundle on shipping.&nbsp; This is the best pricing we could find - but we're still looking.&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style=""font-size: small""><strong><span style=""color: #339966"">The cool season garden is tapering off to nothing as summer approaches</span></strong>.</span>&nbsp; Still have lettuce and chard though - and the onions/garlic won't harvest until mid June.&nbsp; I'm not entirely satisfied with what we produced with this planting.&nbsp; While nature had something to do with it (like that weeklong deep freeze...) I probably could have started earlier and protected the garden better overall.&nbsp; Next cool season I will be protecting with hoop row covers all season long.&nbsp; It doesn't look as nice, but maybe I can use my imagination and come up with something not entirely hideous.&nbsp; We did produce a decent amount - and, more importantly we learned some valuable lessons.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><strong><span style=""color: #800080""><span style=""font-size: small"">I am already started with the warm seaon garden though </span></span></strong>- tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, okra, beans, and cucumbers, and summer squash&nbsp;are all in the ground.&nbsp; This weekend I'll be planting some cover crop (buckwheat), planing a bed&nbsp;of butternut squash&nbsp;as well as re-planting basil (first planting were some old seeds I was hoping were still good - didn't pan out).&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm determined to get a good crop - and I'll be sticking close to the garden this season nurturing it along. <br /><br /><strong><span style=""font-size: small"">I'm going to post a photo slideshow this weekend - yep, promise<br /></span></strong><br />"

"event","In the , almost, two years Marcel and I have been married we've learned that our interests and motivations are freakishly similar (unless someone is fibbing just to stay in good graces....)

One of the most important is that both of us have a desire to homestead full-time.&nbsp; As &quot;off the grid&quot; as possible for two modern people who can't live without their I-Phones.&nbsp; 

We'd like to have a little smokehouse - and heat with a combination of solar and wood.&nbsp; We want to make our own wine - and our own sausage, tend a garden that feeds us - and put up food for the winter months.&nbsp; 

We (well....to be honest I) want to have a family cow or at the very least a Nubian milking goat.&nbsp; I want to have a milking shed and have that chore be mine every morning.

Ideally we'd like to have a cellar - and a REAL attic (not just a crawl space).&nbsp; If possible we'd like to have either a pond or a stream on the property (we figure a property on a lake or river might be above what we're willing to pay).&nbsp; 

In my dreams I'd like this homestead to be in Oregon or Washington State, but - we'd probably get a lot more for our money in Arkansas, Missouri, or perhaps North Carolina (other areas I think are suitable for the lifestyle we want to live).

We could always stay on Sunshine Acre in New Braunfels and do what we can to be self-sufficient; however,&nbsp;civilization is creeping our way -&nbsp;they are building a Walgreens just down the hill&nbsp;(and then there's the neighbor with the car repair business that lives next door.... kind of ruins the warm fuzzies from nature).&nbsp; We are really wanting more of a Waldens Pond or Little House on the Prairie lifestyle (and we don't mind doing the chores every day to have it) :-)

I love that we have this dream to work towards together.
I hope we can make it a reality before we're too old to fully enjoy it.
I hope that my husband stays true and helps make it happen for us. 
(much of making this a reality&nbsp;is in his area of influence)"

"event","The Lyndon B Johnson State Park is located on Hwy 290 Between Johnson City and Stonewall Texas.  It's a beautiful park for a picnic, and there are lots of activities planned throughout the year.  The visitor center offers tours, and you can get a cd for your car for a driving tour.  I am looking forward to returning very soon.<br /><br />The Sauer-beckmann Farmstead is a living history farm.  The staff work the farm just like it was worked in 1915 using the same implements and without running water and electricity.  Such a great history lesson.<br /><br />I went with my friend Bea, and we had a great time.  I went specifically for the sausage making demonstration, and it was a good learning experience.  I was wishing my husband was there with me the whole time - he's gonna really love this place!

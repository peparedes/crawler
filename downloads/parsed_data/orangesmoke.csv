"event","Whoa!!!! what a weekend! IT was um exciting i dont think that there was a dull moment. From partying to almost getting killed. Sat: stupid inservice.. same shit everytime. then beach which was O.K. wasnt great but it was nice to just chill for a while. uhh then party. WHOA... I had fun or so i was told...jk. Sun: breakfast... lunch.... went out to movies. On the way to the movies this car was trying to pass me as i was changing lanes and we almost crashed. Now u'd think it end there but nooo the car was full of pissed of people who decided they wanted to kick the shit outta me so they start following and chasing me. I finally lost em after a while but they were really persistant. So taht was ummm... exciting, being chased by 4 or 5 guys screaming and yelling out their car windows and throwing shit. After that i went and saw I, Robot. It was actually pretty good. Then dinner and home. Aite thats about it so... latez.

THen once iget it i have to make my driving test appointment which will prob be for mid march so if i get it before my b-day ill consider myself lucky. Other than that I wasn't able to buy the paint to flame my door so I need to do that this weekend. Ive decided on orange flames on a blue background, they'll look pretty sweet when they're done. Hmmm.. what else OH YEAH, Check out my webpage www.orangesmoke.com I just added a line of clothes and stuff. I'll add more designs later."

(Esp since thats the only thing in my room thats a normal color) :) If i do paint my door Ill prob post some pics of it on my site but first i gotta go through my flames and pick a design and color theme I like. On to other stuff the whole damn DMV system can go suck my left nut, cause if i dont get to the dmv by wensday to renew my permit it expires and that would totally suck. Plus once I renew theyll let me book a new appoint so hopefull I can get my friggen liscense. Yeah thats it fo now oh yeah by the way COLORADO SUCKS :)"

THIS WEEK SUCKED MONKEY BALLS, this may go down as one of the worst weeks of my life, well maybe. A very long term friend of mine who was like a father to me died this week, and the worst part is the only one to blame is him. He was a big health freak, never ate red meat, didn't eat certain oils, etc etc, but he thought he was f(*&$ng superman and never had any tests run like he was supposed to when he got older to see if say.... 5 f(%*(#)ing arteries were clogged in his goddamn heart. ALL HE HAD TO FRIGGEN DO WAS HAVE A TEST, they do the op. bada bing bada boom he'd still be alive, but nooooooooo thats not how it happened. So hes gone and I cant really remember a time when ive been this down but the reality is the only one to blame is him. Even if it does sound cynical thats how i feel. Aight. Hopefully illpost withing the next few days with something a lil more positive."

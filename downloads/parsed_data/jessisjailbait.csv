"event","i get a certain vibe from you. and i don't know if i feel it because i give off the same vibe to you and i want to believe that you returning the feeling, but it's the most intense feeling i've felt from you in a long time. we're both happy, we wouldn't be able to. we couldn't its been too long. well why shouldn't we? it would be awkward, yes but we've known each other for so long and you're the one i can never give up. so much of who i am is because of you. things that are impossible to change. memories that will never fade. the most vivid colors still fill my head when i think about them - down to the color of our skin tones next to each other as we laid. i'm almost positive it will never be but the thought of it is so nice."

"event","ok. so this morning i woke up because i couldnt stop thinking about josh going to that party with jax & i couldnt get back to sleep so i just got up .. then  josh gave me the comfort of knowing he slept on the same couch with her & nickie yeah comfort.. ok so then i was sitting here straightening my hair & this is what i thought.. i finally know why it bothers me so much.. because josh said his mom ""approves"" of jackie .. yet jackie is the one taking josh to parties so he can drink.. & his mom doesnt approve of me & what do i do..? try to get him to NOT drink & smoke .. WTF it doesnt piss me off so much as it just hurts & makes me feel like i should have never cared & let him learn his lesson for himself .. but what if it took getting super sick from drinking to actually make him learn his lesson.. all i know is i miss him & i do actually love him & jackie is fucking pissing me off because she knows how much he means to me even if her intentions arent bad her intentions are still to take him to parties where he can drink

"event","Well i woke up at about 6o5 & didnt get into the shower until 61o then i picked up mike picked up chrissy & we were all off.. matt & john ended up behind us this morning again so of course they were all viciously driving but you know me.. i slowed down to annoy matt :) then i went to school first period was boring & so was second me & raleigh fought over what color the sun was orange or yellow.. but i dont care what raleigh says i say YELLOW then in 3rd period me & aynaz didnt know wtf was going on so we just sat there & talked like usual :) then in fourth period i got left out as usual no surprise there i tried to scare joe but i didnt work.. of course i waited until josh left to go talk to him but joe says there is no scaring him.. in 5th period me & steph took pictures of tbone, our shoes, & some gay flowers.. SUPER BORING! then in 6th we did our summer reading test & i wrote matt kelly a note about the teacher & ryan told me he put it on the floor so o god watch out! tomorrow might be trouble.. :/ stupid ryan buff! i feel bad cause kristin didnt do summer reading & i wasnt gonna take my test so we'd both have bad grades but i filled in some .. 7th & 8th period always seem the longest we took a test in 7th & i fell asleep lol it was great & in 8th i forget what we did but i almost fell asleep then too then i dropped jax off & then my brother & me & chrissy went to st. mary's to chill with kristin omg it was funny we followed the ice cream man, this kid with hydrolics got kristins number & then we got food & dropped kristin off at the barn & came home.. now im home alone & there is nothing to do & jason was supposed to beep me when he got off work so i could go down there but i guess he's not getting off till late which is gonna suck cause i was gonna take mike & he's high somewhere so we'll see..

Sure what we had we`ve lost, but things don`t stay lost forever, eventually they are found. History also repeats itself & i don`t think we would have been given something so great, for it to just get lost & never be found. I realize it won`t be found anytime soon, but someday perhaps 20 years from now i think what was lost will be found.

Today, i woke up early showered & got jax & took her to school then we came home & woke chrissy up & went to see josh (reppin bikini bottom) lol then we went to the deli, taco bell, to pick hance up & then drop jax off we stopped by josh wolfe's then i dropped them off & came home & waited for my buddy :) & yea i learned about dreams & gay wicca lmao best reaction to that everrrr & reading palms & numerology & bunches of stuff! great fun &hearts;

So josh & i called it a truce on fighting.. i hate fighting with him it makes me feel horrible .. it makes me think the most horrible things as well.. for example today whil playing with a razor i thought.. why not just cut myself? then i threw the razor :(

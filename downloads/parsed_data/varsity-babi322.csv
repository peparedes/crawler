"event","i dont know what to do... everything seems just so confusing! i feel like im completely lost and i dont know why. maybe im just stressed out becuase schools almost over, thank god, becuase if its not that, i dont now what it is. i start work tomorrow morning! finally... money! haha 11-4 saturdays and 4-10 tuesdays... but i wont get to work with my brother :( yet... i get to rain with the other manager, who im already friends with cause of my bro. his name is arbin... ya weird i know, but hes nice. then i have.. mmmmm right, nothing to do for the rest of the weekend. i wanted to hang out with a friend but he has something to do so that idea wont do me any good! oh well... ill think of something.
    lately me and a girl on my squad have been thinking about summer and next season... ooooh were already planning! this summer were going to ""flip camps""... aka tumbling... haha we wanna get our tumbling better for next season. weve also been thinking about who our coach is gonna be.  the coach weve had for the past 2 years said she only coach if nikkis mom helped her out because she wants to see some ofher sons fotoballs games this year. shes probably gonna end up doing it, which will be cool cause shes an AMAZING coach and nikkis mom is great too. was also doesnt have football... but next year will be our first season with a team... and theyre starting out JV. the catch is... they want the cheerleaders to cheer for them, obviously... BUT BUT BUT... varsity cheerleaders for jv football isnt so fun... and they expect us to do it in our uniforms, which our coach disagreed too. she said wed only cheer if they got us warm-ups, and the ones we wanted. so well see how THAT goes... but if you have any advice for suggestions for season please let me know!
    if your from the new england area and you know of tumbling camps/clinics that go on during the summer... itd be great if you could let me know! thanks everyone!

     If You Forget Me
       Pablo Neruda

I want you to know
one thing.

You know how this is:
if I look
at the crystal moon, at the red branch
of the slow autumn at my window,
if I tough
near the fire
the impalable ash
or the wrinkled body of the log,
everything carries me to you,
as if everything that exists,
aromas, light, metals,
were little boats
that sail
toward those isles of yours that wait for me.

Well, now,
if little by little you stop loving me
I shall stop loving you little by little.

If suddenly
you forget me
do now look for me,
for I shall already have forgotten you.

If you think it long and mad, 
the wind of banners
that masses through my life, and you decide
to leave me at the shore
of the heart where I have roots,
remember
that on that day,
at that hour,
I shall lift my arms
and my roots will set off
to seek another land.

But
if each day,
each hour,
you feel tha tyou are destined for me,
with implacable sweetness,
if each day a flower
climbs up to your lips to seek me,
ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated,
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
my love feeds on your love, beloved,
and as lond as you life it will be in your arms
without leavig mine."

           Angels Brought Me Here - Guy Sebastian
Ooohh
It's been a long and winding journey
But I'm finally here tonight
Picking up the pieces
And walking back into the light
Into the sunset of the glory
Where my heart and future lies
There's nothing like that feeling
When I look into your eyes
My dreams came true
When I found you
I found you
My miracle

If you could see
What I see
That you're the answer to my prayers
Oooh if you could feel
The tenderness I feel
You would know
It would be clear
That Angels Brought Me Heres


Standing here before you
Feels like i've been born again
Every breath is your love
Every heartbeat speaks your name
My dreams came true
Right here infront you
My miracle

If you could see
What I see
That you're the answer to my prayers
Oooh if you could feel
The tenderness I feel
You would know
It would be clear
That Angels Brought Me Here

For me to be with you
I'd be forever grateful
ohhhhh forever faithful
My dreams came true 
when I found you
My miracle

If you could see
What I see
That you're the answer to my prayers
Oooh if you could feel
The tenderness I feel
You would know
It would be clear
That Angels Brought Me Here"

"event","confused... i dont even know what to do anymore, and it sucks so bad. i like *him* a lot... and from what he says he likes me... but so does his best friend, which causes so much shit to happen. im stuck in the middle of all of it too. i dont want *him* to walk away from this, from me... you know? i want him to stay a while... i really want him to stay a while. and with his best friend... oooooh boy, thats a whole nother story. heres my issue in a nutshell... i like *him* a lot and he likes me. we talk and hang out when we get the chance and its great, i love it! but his best friend likes me and he confuses the hell outta me. last night he told me ""i know you like him but what if you end up not liking me""... think about it, it made no sense to me... but thats just an opinion. i wish everything would get figured out... this situation is shitay...
  what else is new... softball is started :) lovin it lovin it! i got my number this year, thank god! 3 bitches! woop! hahha softball makes me happy. we have a good team this year, and im anxious to see our outcome. im the starting catcher for the jv team, by the way. its cool... i have fun so its allllll gravy. but i must say... i miss cheerleading!!!! :'( A LOT
  talkin to jon again... ya... i dont even know what to say about him... its been a while... hes still the same little shit head as he was before... thats right... i said THE SAME... hes jon... woohoo *twirls finger in air* just kidding jon... im not gonna even touch the subject of other people... but jon... hes a loser and you should all hate him :)

"event","wow... its been a while! i seem to have a slight problem with keeping on my toes when it comes to updating this thing :/ sorry guys... anywho... yesterday was probably one of the worst days of my life... one of my close friends moved to Arrizona at 5 and im probably never gonna see him again. ive been crying pretty much since i got home from school at 3, and if i wasnt crying, i was holding it in with everything i have. i hate her... her referring to the bitch that took him from everyone he knows and ruined his life. because of her i lost a great friend that i probably will never speak to or see again unless by some miracle chance were in florida at the same time... which kinda sucks :'( but looking on the bright side of things... i talked to him today... a few times actually because his cell phone hates me! i swear it was every like, 8 minutes it would disconnect. he was being a funny kid! haha he told me that i wasnt allowed to go to his baseball games with him because then i would never need sex cause i would orgasm over the guys that were on the field... i couldnt help but laugh hysterically! and it turns out that he spent most of the night at a party about 2 seconds from my friends house... let me tell you, i found that out and i wanted to scream! ummm i dont think i was supposed to fall for him like i did... but, its ok because i really do like him... hes great:) so tonight i watched passion of the christ and it fucking creeped me out SO BAD... it wasnt scary, but some parts in that movie really can creep you our a little... theni watched the exorcist and now im watching the exorcist the beginning... hmmmm i love it. im big on scary movies... however i do prefer to watch them with guys! haha havent talked to the baby since ummm yesterday? what is there even to say about him anymore... hes my love and we fight like its our fucking job... ya its just fun shit! jason is being a lil weird lately too... but i dont even know what to do anymore... with any of them... im conflustered and it sucks. i hate not knowing what to do... but jason knows. we determined that i dont need to tell jason what to do anymore because he already knows, me saying it just proves him right, so i dont bother anymore... oooh yup and my birthdays TUESDAY! woohoo!!! im excited... sweet 16 bitches... it makes me happy... i love it... 
  cheerleading ended on sunday:'( i was SO sad... those are my 2 favorite seasons out of the school year... and now i gotta wait till august or september to start unless i join an all-star team, which i am definalty considering.  does anyone have any suggestions as to some good all-star teams in CT? if you do please let me know... i would very much appreciate... even though softballs starting im still looking... maybe ill pull 2 cheering teams next year. yup softball starts monday, the day before my birthday! woohoo... no i really am looking forward to it but then again im kinda not... its a LOT of hard work but im totally up for it.
   oh well... enough for now... movie time... then probably bed... sleeping till 12 and calling him at 1201 cause thats when he gets out of school :D yay! ta-ta for now my loves...
                                      *(.Cara.)*

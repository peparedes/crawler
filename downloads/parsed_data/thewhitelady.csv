This journal belongs to some crazy woman who lived in Anderson and then moved in with her parents for nearly two years.  And let's face it, people, she was a whiney twit.  For all of you who put up with me through all that shit, thanks.  You rock.  :)  For those of you who somehow missed it . . . what are you doing reading my journal, exactly?  Anyway, I determined that a lot of why I hadn't been posting had to do with the associations I have with this journal.   So, I'm going.  All the cool kids will be added to my new friends list post-haste.  If for some reason I don't add you, go away; you're too ugly to be loved.  Oh, no, wait, I mean that's because I'm stupid, so drop me a line so's I can add you.  So ends this chapter in the life of Becky."

At New York's Kennedy airport today, an individual later discovered to be a
public school teacher was arrested trying to board a flight while in
possession of a ruler, a protractor, a setsquare, a slide rule, and a
calculator.

At a morning press conference, Attorney general John Ashcroft said he
believes the man is a member of the notorious al-gebra movement. He is being
charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction.

""Al-gebra is a fearsome cult,"" Ashcroft said. ""They desire average solutions
by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of
absolute value. They use secret code names like ""x"" and ""y"" and refer to
themselves as ""unknowns"", but we have determined they belong to a common
denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country.

""As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, there are 3 sides to every
triangle,"" Ashcroft declared.

When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, ""If God had wanted
us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more
fingers and toes.

""I am gratified that our government has given us a sine that it is intent on
protracting us from these math-dogs who are willing to disintegrate us with
calculus disregard. Murky statisticians love to inflict plane on every
sphere of influence,"" the President said, adding: ""Under the circumferences,
we must differentiate their root, make our point, and  draw the line.""

President Bush warned, ""These weapons of math instruction have the potential
to decimal everything in their math on a scalene never before seen unless we
become exponents of a Higher Power and begin to factor-in random facts of
vertex.""

Attorney General Ashcroft said, ""As our Great Leader would say, read my
ellipse. Here is one principle he is uncertainty of: though they continue to
multiply, their days are numbered as the hypotenuse tightens around their
necks."""

AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
ECO BANK,COTONOU, 
REPUBLIC OF BENIN
DIRECT TEL 00-229-483-784.

Dear good friend,

I am MR.Sam Aronu,the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of ECO BANK OF COTONOU REPUBLIC OF 
BENIN with due respect and regard.I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that  will be very beneficial to both 
of us at the end of the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a 
deceased person who died on 31st october 1999 in Egyptian airways plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his 
account with this Bank without any  claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this 
development.

Although personally,I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be profitable 
and successful. During the time of execution. The said amount was us$21.5M(TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED 
THOUSAND UNITED SATES DOLLARS).

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund  with you as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, and  
transfer this money to a foreign account  has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as 
soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self in this great business opportunity.In 
fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate 
a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this  bank. 
This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as The next of kin will present to the 
bank with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-
transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the 
bank,where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transactionis 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 
30% of the total sum as gratification,while 70% will be for me and my partners.

Please,you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude 
this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask 
us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further 
investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.

All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible 
stating your wish in this deal.   

CALL ME UP RECEIPT OF THIS MESSAGES FOR MORE DETAILS
ON MY TELEPHONE NUMBER 00-229-483-784.FOR MORE DETAILS

The surreality of this was really brought home by the fact that I knew, even in my dream, that we live in a third floor apartment.  I could walk out my front door and I would be in Concord, but if I walked out my back door, I would be in Black Rock City.  My back door was always open, and sometimes I'd wake up to find dusty, costumed strangers on my couches (I had neon inflatable couches, and one loveseat covered in soft white material, with a red throw over the back).  It was like living halfway between a dream and reality, only it was impossible to tell which was which."

"event","Walking in Oakland is a very unique experience.  Despite the complete urbanity, there's something very earthy and primal about the city, as though humanity's marks are all there at nature's suffrance.  You can see it in the sidewalks, cracked and broken between tiny green weeds, along 580 at the maze, the huge highway structures somehow overshadowed by the sheer presence of the Bay.  Sometimes it's more vivid: following little orange detour arrows around emergency crews that work frantically to find survivors between a sandwiched highway; blinking smoke and ash out of my eyes as I help carry a terrified cat to its owner's car, a firestorm raging less that two blocks away, eucalyptus popping in the distance.

As much as I detest my job, I love walking to BART in the afternoons.

It seems that I will be looking for a new job, after all.  If I get this promotion, I won't be able to go to school, and if I don't get this promotion, I won't be able to eat, so . . . yeah.  But I kind of knew this was coming, so that's okay.  Planning on hitting the restaurant circuit on Wednesday or Thursday.

If all goes well, my schedule come fall will be approximately as follows: MWF, get up way to fucking early (but a good two hours later than I get up now), jazz dance for an hour followed by back-to-back band and orchestra.  Then I get two hours for lunch, then cello class.  On Monday, I'll have physics lab until 5.  Tuesday and Thursday, I'd pretty much be at school from 11 a.m. on, but I'd have lots of breaks between classes.  C, then break, then physics, then an even longer break, then calculus.  It sounds absolutely exhausting, and if I can pull this off, I think I'll be a lot happier.  I've been rediscovering that I actually have energy when I'm doing things I care about.  I may pass on the dance class, since it's so damn early, but since my conception of early has been so drastically screwed by nine months of getting up at 5, it may not seem so bad.  I think it will mostly depend on how late I have to work on Sundays."

"event","For the past several years, I have worked at various customer-service-type jobs.  I always just assumed that such jobs were inherently horrible and/or that my tendencies toward introversion made them seem a lot worse than they were.  Lately, however, I've begun to wonder if there isn't something more going on.

One of the things Borders employees are required to do is ask every customer they ring up if they would like to receive our email newsletter.  After my first month there, I was informed that I was not gathering my expected quota of emails (3% of customers, if you're wondering).  Since I had asked every single customer, and since I had received some downright hostile responses, I was somewhat irritated.  So, I resolved to do better.  I talked to my managers, asked for advice.  Without fail, every male manager responded with some variant of ""just ask; it works for me.""  When I questioned my managers about how would be the best way to difuse a hostile response (and I DO mean hostile -- about the response I'd expect if I'd asked for Driver's License, SSN and major credit card info), all of my female managers told me to just laugh it off, these things happen.  With one exception, my male managers told me that they'd never had to deal with any such thing, pretty much implying that I was making this up or overreacting.

So, I started watching the monthly postings of how many emails everyone had collected.  Every month, in the six months I've worked there, every person who has broken the 5% mark has been over 30.  Every person who has broken the 10% has also been a white man.  No woman under 25 has managed to break 3%.

After a couple of months of watching these figures, I started paying closer attention to employee-customer interactions, thinking back on some of the other jobs I've held, and really talking to friends and co-workers about their experiences, and what I've found really disturbs me.  Women, particularly young women, in customer service postions seem to experience a much higher level of verbal abuse from customers.  Almost all of the younger (in their 20s or late teens) women I've talked to have been grabbed by a customer who wanted their attention (what the hell ever happened to ""excuse me, can I get some help, please?"").  When engaged in friendly conversation with customers, men between the ages of 18 and 25 are often asked what they are studying in college (regardless of whether or not they're actually attending) while women of the same age are asked about their children (regardless of whether or not they have any, and please note the plural).

But what bothers me the most, beyond the obvious sexism and agism, is that <i>almost all of this ugly behavior is perpetrated by women!</i>  How can the female contingent of corporate America complain about salary inadequacies and glass ceilings if they're going to go out to dinner afterwards and physically accost and verbally abuse their waitress while cracking jokes with the young waiter serving the table next to theirs?  As long as women with political and financial power are upholding sexist attitudes, there is no hope for equality.  Maybe if I start referring to all of my female customers as ""baby"" or ""sweetcheeks"" they'll start to get it, but probably I'd just get fired."

I don't even know why the POS terminals have a way to register people purchasing coupons.  And I think I may have caused the power to go out today.  It went out first in the cafe when I bought my soda, and then kind of spread.  The registers all went down when I walked past them.  Oops."

"event","And I am still me

Alone amongst a thousand satellites
But always with you
Holding my hand

You touch the dark places
Kiss them awake like burning stars
And yet I am

In the darkness
The muddied shadow of humanity
And you are here

Within me
Without that which man has names for
You understand

Where no one can
Where the emptiness swallows me
You understand

And I am free"

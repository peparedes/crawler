Well I'm back the camping trip was fun we got to play man hunt and paintball. We got there thursday afternoon the guys put up there tents and the girls got to sleep in the cabin. Afterwords we walked around the woods and started a fire cause it started to get a lil cold but no that much (all though the girls were complaining that it was 2 cold all weekend), then we fixed dinner and the girls went 2 see a movie at the local movie theatre (which only played 2 movies) because they didn't want 2 play Capture the flag (CTF) so the guys played CTF for a while then we got bored and we started rosting Marshmellows over the fire and talking about guys stuff. Finally the girls came back around midnight after saying they would be back at like 8:30 or 9 and we all went 2 sleep.

The next day me, Sabashtin (Bashin), and Pastor Jack (PJ) were the first ones up and we started a fire again and fixed breakfast then about 8:30 everyone else was up so we ate breakfast and played around for most of the day. We walked around some more to check out the woods and everything then PJ brought out one of his grandpas old guns and some targets for us to shoot at it was fun, then he pulled out his and had david throw an old paint can into the air and he shot it 3 time in a row there was a huge hole in the side of it, it was kool. Then afterwords we had lunch and played paintball it was fun PJ had Bashin and Peter stand about 20 ft. away from him w/o a paintball gun or any protective wear except a mask and he shot them. He nailed both of them in the nuts it was funny as hell. Then we sent dustin out into the woods and PJ, Mike, Joey, and I hunted him down Mike ended up cathing him and shooting him it was funny cause he shot him right in the middle of his ass and he fell to ground holding his ass he couldn't sit down for 15 mins. Then later on that night we had dinner which was good cause it was hamburgers and deer meat, it tasted good. Then everyone played a game of CTF and Manhunt it was much fun cause in CTF manhunt we didn't use any flashlights and Patty was running and she ran right into a tree it was so funny, and me, and Bashin both ran into this puddle of water and got our shoes all wet and muddy it was disgusting. Then after the game we went on a hey ride which was kool but it was a lil to cold everyone was a cuddled up next to eachother so we could keep warm then while we were going down the road this dog came out from one of the houses on the street and it started chasing us it was all though a couple of the girls got scared cause they thought the dog was gonna get them lol. After we got back from the hey ride we sat around the camp fire and talked and burned just about anything we could find and would burn it was fun then about 12:30 a.m. we all went 2 bed.

Then today we backed everything up and loaded the vans up and left around 1:30 p.m. but like 10 mins. after we left the camp site the left rear tire blew and we had to pull over and fix it then we went over to PJ's parents house for about an hour and we played with the horse and we picked cotton it was fun we all picked a lot so we could make our own lil pillows out of it (we would make good black people out there picking cotton back in the old day). then we left there headed home we stopped at Taco Bell for dinner the ride home wasn't as much fun as it was on the way there but thats ok cause we were all kinda tired.

Well thats all for now sry again that it was so long I'll ttyl peace.

Oh yeah since I wasn't here to say it on January 1st HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!"

I've been stressed out about a lot of things lately and everything keeps getting worse. I haven't been able to sleep right in a while since all of this shit started. I wish I new what to do but I don't, there is someone who can help me with some of this stuff but I don't think she will because of something that happened between us ( if you don't know what I'm talking about then I'm not gonna tell you so don't ask ).

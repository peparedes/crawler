A couple of weekends ago I went to Scarborough Faire and had a blast.  Last weekend I had my neice for a few days and had fun with her over.  My sisters baby shower was Sunday and I went to her house for that.  She lives in Temple, TX which is right outside of Waco.  Otherwise I've just been working which sucks also."

"event","I just bought a 27 inch flat screen tv from WalMart last night.  It is awesome.  I only paid about $154 for it since I had a gift card to pay for the rest of the amount.  The tv with tax was $205 and really nice.  My sister and brother-in-law came into town last night and we did Christmas at my house.  We went and ate dinner at Chili's with one of my sisters friends and then went to WalMart for the shopping spree."

I got a few carousel horse figures from my grandparents plus a fairy figure also.  My ex-roommate/wife gave me a watch-bracelet set, a necklace with my birthstone, and $20.  My sister bought me a vacuum which she will be up when she comes up on the 1st.  Happy New Year everyone and be safe."

I went to WalMart after I cashed my check at work.  I bought my very own first toaster.  I kinda had to since my roommates moved out and took all of their kitchen stuff.  I also bought silverware because the silverware that I already own is still at my dad's house in Missouri.  Then I also bought five new dvd's to add to the ones that I bought earlier this week.  This week I bought Wrong Turn, The Patriot, A Man Apart, Patch Adams, Interview With The Vampire, Little Women, Bringing Down the House, Men Of Honor and Guess Who.  All bought curtesy of Kroger.  I got the same bonus deal as Jessa a former co-worker.  Well I'll update other info sooner or later.  Oh and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone. Jessa if you read this do you still live at the same apt.?"

"event","Ok so I am working like 7 days a week with both jobs.  I haven't had a day off in a month and it's starting to get to me now.  I am tired all day long even when I sleep the other half of the day.  The only reason I get up is to go to work.  It's alright though.  I'm making money and it's not like I have that much else to do.  Except trying to date someone but thats not working because I am working all the time.  Knowing how this dating thing happened last time it won't work but I have to try.  I am working full time at Kroger and part time at Babies R Us.  I wish I had a set schedule.  The only thing that is set is that I have wednesdays and fridays off at Kroger to work at Babies R Us.  Making almost $11 an hour rocks though.  It's better then the $6.76 an hour I make at Babies R Us.  That just wasn't paying anything.  Now I am paying stuff off and still have some money left over.  Not that I have anything to show for it since I am not saving any of the money I earn.  Soon I might learn to save money.  I have Thanksgiving at my moms house but only after I worked that day thanks to Kroger.  That's alright though since I figured that I would have to work.  It was just me and my mom this year for the holidays so we didn't have to work all that turkey dinner stuff out around other family members.  Saturday the 19th I had Thanksgiving dinner with my roommates family.  I'm kinda still part of the family even though he is married and stuff.  Family by association now I guess is what I am."

"event","So I've been working at Kroger again now.  This will be my third week back.  Everyone seems to like me there and I'm well known or something like that.  For the last 3 weeks I've been getting all the late shifts.  Mostly 5p.m. to 1 a.m., the earliest I've gotten off was midnight but even still was late enough.  The earliest I get off this week is 8p.m. I'm guessing that's to keep me at the 35 hours I'm only supposed to be getting or something.  It's all good though.  I'm making $10.95 an hour and the checks are weekly and a good amount.  I am still working part time at Babies R Us part time two days a week. Working there Wednesday's and Friday's with eight hour shifts.  So I get 16 hours a week there at $6.76 an hour.  Now you see why I went back to Kroger.  It's wierd though being at Kroger because I see all these familiar faces from when I worked at my home store that is down the street from the store I am working at now.  I've seen about 10-15 different people that were regulars at my old store.  Last night I even saw a co-manager that I worked with over at the Plano store.  I couldn't remember his name but he remembered mine.  Next week I think that they are going to start me working in Customer Service.  Ahh customer service... I had to work so hard to get out of there at the old store and I'm going to get stuck right back in there.  What else am I going to do though?  I need the money and I get enough right now so I can't really complain too much."

Also I think I might end up making $10.95 an hour.  Talk about SWEET!! Jessa I'll be working right down the street from you.  I was going to visit you at your store but ended up leaving 587 at around 4 p.m. and figured you would have left work already.  I am going to try and work both Kroger and Babies R Us but with not being able to have a set schedule at either job I may or may not stay at Babies R Us for long.  I think I'll be starting next week at Kroger.  I'll only be getting 35 hours a week but it'll be worth it making over $4.00 an hour more then what I'm making at Babies R Us."

"event","Are you tired of all those sissy friendship poems that
always sound good,
but never actually come close to reality? Well, here
is a series of promises that really speaks to true
friendship:

1. When you are sad -
I will help you get drunk and plot revenge against the
sorry bastard who made you sad.
2. When you are blue -
I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you.
3. When you smile -
I will know you finally got laid.
4. When you are scared -
I will rag on you about it every chance I get.
5. When you are worried -
I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse
it could be and to quit whining.
6. When you are confused -
I will use little words.
7. When you are sick -
Stay the hell away from me until you are well again. I
don't want whatever you have.
8. When you fall -
I 
will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

This is my oath...I pledge it till the end. 
Why? You may ask.
Because you are my friend.
Send this to 10 of your closest friends, then get
depressed because you can only think of two and one of
them isn't speaking to you right now anyway.

Remember:
A good friend will help you move. A really good friend
will help you move a body.
Let me know if I ever need to bring a shovel.

"event","I started at a new Babies ""R"" Us store today that's here in TX.  UUggghhh.  New people + new environment = uncomfortable Jade.  Well eventually I will get used to it but I want to be at my old store with my old co-workers. Well some of them at least lol.  Jessa you were right about Sharon.  I saw her the other day at her Kroger so I could talk to her about working at Kroger.  She does look a little older.  She is the same ole Sharon though.  I was thinking today on how I do kinda miss working for Kroger.  Although the whole time I worked there I was like I hate this place I want to work somewhere else.  The job I have now is so boring it's not even funny.  It doesn't get busy during the week and only gets a little busier during the week.  Jessa have they moved you guys to another store yet?  Where did you say they were moving you guys too?  I'm not even close to being able to work in the area that I'd like to.  I'm in Dallas but on the border of Mesquite and Garland area.  It sucks because nobody I know live out here.  I know I don't know a whole lot of people but still I'm not even close to the people I do know.  Gas is like $3.00 a gallon.  I put $11.00 of gas into my car last night and it wasn't even four gallons and it was only a little over 1/4 of a tank.  What a gip..  Oh well gotta get used to it I guess.  I guess it's a good thing work is not even 15 minutes away from where I live.  I want to work at a Kroger cause I know I can make almost four dollars an hour more then what I am making now.  

On another note it absolutely sucks living with an ex-boyfriend and his new wife.  Esp. when you don't have anyone at all.  I would like someone that I can date and cuddle and be with.  In time in time I need to keep saying to myself."

"event","Woo hoo extra hours at work.  I need to actually find just a different job and make more then $6.50 an hour.  The store I am working at is closing and we are all moving to another location near the St. Louis Mills mall.  For those of you in Texas yes it is just like Grapevine Mills mall.  So yet again I get to help close another store that I've worked at and gotten used to.  If you don't remember when I worked for Kroger I had to close a store that I worked at for about 7 years off and on.  Arrgggh oh well.  At least I have a job and making a little bit of money.  Other then that I still don't have anything else to do.  I still have no friends.  All that is my fault though since I did make the decision to move to this stupid town in this stupid state.  I miss all of my friends and the area that I got used to being in."

"event","I had this dream last night while I was sleeping.  It had my friend Jessa in it and for some reason we were in my bedroom talking about things she wanted to get off of her chest.  She was talking about whatever was bothering her and I just laid there listening.  I think the reason I had this dream was because I read her lj before going to sleep.  It reminded me of working with her and we would sit there and talk.  

Last night my step-mom and I went to this place called Our Place it is a bar that's right down the street.  This really cute guy came and out and then finally back in.  His name is Bryan and he is 30.  I might just go back in next weekend and see if he is there again.  He didn't believe that I was 25 but yeah I get that a lot.  I get Thanksgiving off only cause the store I work at is closed Thanksgiving day.  I know I'll get Christmas off also cause the store will be closed then also.  This will be the first Thanksgiving that I'll be spending with my dad's family.  It will be a change but it'll be nice.  I was at KMart today and I saw the movie Pitch Black for only $4.99 and had to get it.  One cause it has Vin Diesel in it and two cause I had already bought Chronicles Of Riddick the day it came out at Target for $15.99.  So yeah I have a thing for Vin Diesel.

We only had a little bit of detergent left on the one bottle of stuff here I thought I would be nice and bought a couple of things of laundry detergent.  I bought two bottles of detergent, Shrek 2 on dvd for only $15.99, and three bottles of Sunny Delight for $1.00 a piece.  Then I went to a grocery store and bought some wild cherry pepsi.  For lunch I went to IHOP for lunch and then off to work.  I didn't do much really at work, I don't usually.  My grandparents were in town because my grandpa's brother died.  They live in Arkansas so I don't get to see them really.  After work I met them up at an IHOP up the street from work.  So I didn't get home til after 11 p.m. and now I am watching Shrek 2."

A few black ladies tried to steal somethings today but I think that all that stupid stuff was stopped cause we paid special close attention to them to scare them lol.  This lady at work said maybe she should hook me up with her son.  She said that he is 30, is a manager at Kinko's, single and lonely.  HMMMM  single and lonely sounds like me.  Who knows relationships don't seem to happen for me in the last couple of years.  Not that I try too hard to go out and meet people.  That's life me without friends or a life.  Night."

I had three days off in a row from work.  Ahh yeah.  LOL  I went trick-or-treating with my sisters, nephews, and step-mom on Sunday.  It was cold and raining and I forgot to put on my sweatshirt cause I left it in the car.  My step-mom bought us haloween t-shirts so we were in the spirit or something.  I didn't do much at work today except make labels for the new store.  I worked in Baby Registry today.  Lots of fun; my life's dream!! NOT!!  night I should have been asleep hours ago."

I actually kinda miss it.  You know it was a big part of my life for almost 7 years.  I was so used to working there and I got paid alright, didn't have to pay for my health insurance, and I got 40 hours a week.  I actually wouldn't mind going back there if I knew I would be making what I used to make.  There are no Kroger grocery stores here in Missouri though.  None of the gorcery stores here are hiring not that it would be the same though.  I guess I also miss working with all the people I got used to working with there and had worked with for so long.   Ahh that's life though.  Remember to set your clocks back an hour today.  Happy Haloween.  Have a nice day."

"event","So it's obvious I have forgotten to update in quite a while.  Well I am still working at Babies R Us and it's been a little over a month now that I've been working there.  I work the Baby Registry Desk, cashier, and money counter which is counting all the tills in the morning and doing a few reports.  Sucky job for what they pay me there.  Umm a few weeks ago I had strep throat and had that for like two weeks.  That sucked really bad.  I think I got it as punishment for being bad but I got better cause I've been a good girl now.  Plus I didn't have health insurance so I had to pay $50 just for the doctor to tell me that I had strep throat.  The good thing though is that he gave me samples of what he would have just given me a prescription for.  So I didn't have to go to the pharmacy and get a prescription filled and pay for that.  I missed three days of work so my check for that week was only like $60 stupid $6.50 an hour job.  Plus for the two weeks or so that I was sick I couldn't eat anything real cause it hurt too much.  Too bad I didn't lose some extra weight.  I am going to try and get a job at Home Depot where I know I'll make more money and will probably get more hours and stuff too.  I bought Matthew Monty Python's The Life Of Brian on DVD for his birthday which was 9/26 but still haven't sent it out to him yet.  He keeps asking why haven't I sent it yet and I say cause I haven't.  I'll send it tomorrow cause the post office closed at 5p.m. and I got there later then that but oh well.  At least I bought him something.  I want my own apartment but don't make enough money to even come close to pay rent.  I don't wanna live at my dad's house anymore cause people make too much damn noise around here.  And the drama here you wouldn't believe so much drama happens in one house.  I mean it's just retarded how much shit happens around here because of whoever is dating or not dating someone or something like that.  I am used to it being quiet and very non-dramatic but here it's quite the opposite.   I have this friend back home (in TX) that is married so you know I can't really get with him but now that I have moved to Missouri him and his wife have decided on doing a threesome kinda thing.  He choose me as his choice which kinda surprised his wife since she thought he would choose someone else but she hasn't choosen anyone yet.  The thing is though I live nowhere close to them anymore so that can't happen.  Not that I am that excited about his wife being there but if that's the way that I could be with him then I guess ok or something.  Oh well can't really mess with that kinda thing."

I'm here in Missouri and have been here something like a month and a half.  for about a month I didn't have a job which sucked since I was bored out of my mind.  Finally I got a job and I am in my second week working there.  I am working at Babies R Us and I don't think I'll really like it there a whole lot.  It is a job though and it gets me out of the house.  I am only working there part time and only making $6.50 an hour which sucks.  I'm used to working 40 hours a week and getting paid $10.65 an hour.  At least I have a job and getting paid so that's something.  I am working as a money counter, cashier, and in the baby registry.  Maybe I'll find something different soon or whatever or maybe I'll stay and see how this goes.  I've gone to bingo a few times with my grandma but haven't won anything yet.  Maybe one night when I go I'll win something but I am still waiting on that day.  I filled out an application again at the pizza place my sister works at so that maybe I can get a second part time job so I can make some more money.  I don't know but it will give me something more to do and maybe I might meet some friends there.  So far I know noone but the family that I have living here and a few neighbors."

Then on Monday morning of next week I am leaving for my dad's."

"event","Yeah so I am a little anxious.  My last available day of work is the 14th of this month and I can't wait.  Finally I will actaully get away from the hell that is called Kroger.  Actually I guess it isn't that bad but I have just been with Kroger way too long.  My birthday is in ten days and I'll be 25.  My mom said she would give me money which will be good.  I might just use that for gas or something.  Maybe I will make myself be special and rent a hotel room just for the fun of it or I don't know.  This lady my mom knows said I looked like I was 13.  I was like no way I'll be 25 next week.  Stupid lady.  I babysat my neice Saturday night and we went to Chucky Cheese's and had fun. She is so cute.  We went swimming also and that was fun."

"event","Yesterday I went to the mall so I could eat at a place called Big Easy because they have bourbon chicken and really good potatoes.  I couldn't eat that cause they were closed and that sucked.  I even went out of my way to go tomy bank and get out cash since they only take cash.  Oh well I guess,  I had Sonic instead but it wasn't as good.  Then since I was bored I walked around the mall.  After the mall I went to WalMart to get gas and then went to Big Lots to take up some more of my boredom.  After Big Lots I went to Super Target to look around.  I ended up buying Drumline and Waterboy on dvd since Drumline was on sale for $10.00 and Waterboy was only $9.44.  On Monday I was at target and bought a new pillow for only $2.99 and Forrest Gump on VHS for only $6.99.  I shouldn't really be spending money on this stuff and should be paying bills.  {Shrugs}  L8r."

"event","I got back Saturday morning from my vacation. I went up to Missouri to see family.  I filled out a few applications while I was up there. Didn't want to fill out too many though.  I don't know how much longer I will stay here; maybe just three more weeks.  Decisions decisions.  Then on Friday we drove to my Grandparents and spent the day there to visit.  On vacation we saw three movies: Spiderman 2, Dodgeball, and I. Robot."

I saw some fireworks last night after I got of work in Addison.  I start vacation next week next Friday and then all of next week.  I'm going to drive to my dad's and Matthew's going with me.  My dog and most of my other things are already up there."

"event","Just got back home a little while ago from driving to Missouri.  I moved like 98.9% of my crap up there since I am moving to my dads house.  Yesterday we left the apartment at about 4 a.m. after only getting about 2 hours of sleep.  I had already been up since 7 a.m. cause I worked 8-4 friday.  We finally got to my dad's house at about 3:15 p.m.  Then we unpacked the two cars and took everything to the basement and just set it all in a corner.  Had to do that since they didn't clean out the room that I am going to be using.  But they had a good reason for not cleaning it out.  My grandma had a heart attack and then had to get a quadruple bipass (spelling)  and has been in the hospital for a few days.  Then we kinda just hung out at the house and talked to my family and stuff.  Had hamburgers for dinner.  Slept from about 12a.m. to about 4:30 a.m. and then left my dad's house about 5a.m. and started driving home.  Lucky me I didn't have to drive all the way home.  Matthew drove the whole time while my lazy butt stayed in the back seat sleeping/laying there prentending to sleep."

"event","Moving my stuff to my dad's this weekend.  I still have some things to pack but I'm glad I think I have mostly just little crap to throw in boxes.  Eleven hours to drive there and eleven back and doing all that in one weekend since I get off work at 4 on Friday and have to be back at work Monday at 3:30.  Work sucks but that's normal.  Went and saw Chronicles of Riddick and it was a good movie.  Vin Deisel is awesome, if I had one wish at this moment it would be to have hime talk to me all of the time about anything at all.  I love his voice.  Later I need to make dinner."

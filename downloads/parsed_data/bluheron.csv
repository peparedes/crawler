"event","I love being outside right now. It really makes me so much more pleasant when it is not too hot, and not too cold. I am fortunate to not have allergies. 
Not too much going on ... we put a new deck on the house, which I didn't know it could bring me so much pleasure. And, work gave me a laptop and I can now surf outside - thanks to the wonders of wireless technologies. Somehow though I don't think my work intended the laptop for hanging out on the deck, drinking scotch and surfing the internet. HA! 
Got a good weekend planned ... mtn biking tomorrow, some gardening, and my brothers coming over on Sunday for brunch. I swear, I hope I don't get hit by bus because I am down right content with pretty much everything... :-)

Oh yeah, and if you haven't seen the most recent Chris Rock special on HBO, please catch it, it was so fucking funny."

"event","I was reminded recently that I don't post very often. Ok, so it's true, but I will try to be better. 
We saw Twilight Singers last night at Smith's Old Bar. On a school night even ... it was so much fun, but the ringing in my ears has yet to stop. Last night, it was so loud, but so great. I thought at one point maybe I should put some ear plugs in or something, but even though it was so load, I didn't mind, I thought it sounded really good. Today at work someone tried to get my attention and I didn't even hear them. And, when I told someone that I couldn't hear because I had recently seen a band that was really load, they asked, ""Britney?"" I immediately was like - yeah, right - no way. Then as I thought to myself, you know, I would go see Britney, if it was free or something. I bet her show would at least be pretty entertaining. I wouldn't want some nose bleed seats or anything ... ever since the Toxic video, I have a new look on Britney. Wow, this is a confession I don't know is one to be sharing ..."

"event","I had this really bizarre dream, the kind that really sticks with you long after you have been jolted awake. The dream was I was with my parents, alisimo and another friend and we were in this building waiting from some kind of show to start, but it was a dinner theatre type thing, because the seating was such that I wasn't facing the main stage. Strangely, before entering the building I noticed an airtraffic control tower. And, as we were trying to enter, we were walking up this hill that was laid with straw and we all kept slipping. This guy my dad was meeting for business came down and helped us the hill. My dad went off with him and told us he would see us later. Anyway, once were were insid, the building was really rocking back and forth and I noticed this woman next to us who was visibly upset by the building movement. But she wasn't leaving as if that wasn't an option. And then, it finally just rocked to the left and essentially began to tip over and we began to fall. Everything went silent as we were falling and I remember saying, ""how is this going to work out?"" and then realizing that it was going to smash into smitherines when it landed. But, of course, before it landed and killed us all, I woke up .... really rattled my cage. Weird, huh?"

"event","I remember hearing people say, ""Oh, I should have Decaf, or I will be up all night."" And, I remember thinking, jeez, that's old ... one cup of coffee shouldn't keep you up all night. Now, I had a cup of coffee at 9, and I am afraid I will be up for some time. Crap, I'm getting old ... 

But, on a more humorous note, I appreciated this recent article on the onion

"event","John and Holly came for dinner last night and we narrowly tied up the Cranium challenge. One game to one. I was really sad to give up the bottle of Bombay Saphire - which was the bet on our first game. That's an awfully nice bottle to lose.
I am pretty happy that today is only a two day work week. If it was a three day work week, I might work for Congress. 
The recruiter called yesterday and needs to reschedule our luncheon due to a funeral he is attending today. That sucks about the funeral - those are never fun. 
I am taking Corolla in to work to show my boss. She is offering a new laptop in exchange for the car. It could be pretty sweet but I still need to see the laptop. But, the other side is that Jim and Julie really want the Corolla. We shall see how it all pans out.....
Traffic is going to suck today."

"event","Ah, my first time at the live journal thing. Can't sleep right now - due to being home sick today and sleeping on and off all day. The Nyquil will set in shortly and hopefully I won't be up too much longer. I am missing the Twilight Singers tonight which is a real bummer. I missed them the last time they were here too. Last time was because of a wedding I think. But, I think it may have been sold out anyway. I hope D still got to go so I can hear about from him. I heard the show in NY was fantastic, but its Greg Dulli, so its bound to be entertaining at the bare minimum.
I sent off my resume to a few places today ... been thinking about that interview question that you always get, ""So, Why are you looking for a new job?"" I wish just once I could say, ""Because I'm sick of where I am at and looking for something new."" But that's not ""appropriate."" I did get one call back from a recruiter today, so that will hopefully be fruitful. 
Getting sleepy ... check out www.notproud.com if you haven't seen it. I found it quite humorous..."

"event","Life has been going amazingly.

i have a lovely boyfriend.

we have an apartment together and will be getting a house together once this lease is up in july.

i have 2 dogs.  [technically one is matts and the other is ours but i think they both have become ours]  Caylee and Maya.

My job is boring but pays well and is 9-5 monday through friday so i am content with that for now though i probably will be looking for a better career later on.  to much of an artist for accounting...

things can always get better but could always get worse and right now i thnk i am doing just fine and have no real complaints."

i've changed.
.....for the better.

...with a touch of sour.

maybe a lot sweeter...yea-that sounds better.

i'm happier.  :D"

"event","okay so today was insane and basically decided a lot of things for me for the next....year atleast....

i went to a job interview that wendy had gotten me at an accounting firm...i thought this was an interview to help out in an office run little errands and basically just do the little jobs no one else wanted to do but yet get some good practice and experience in and learn some about what goes on and what an accountant does.  i get there and he gives me a job as a book keeper taking the place of a girl that already works there.  with absolutely no training and no formal education in accounting...they'll train me in everything.  i start out on salary pay of 400 a week.  after 90 days i get a 25 dollar raise...after a year i get another 25 dollar raise and every year after that it gets to be more.  also i get cash bonuses during tax time being theres more work and i work mon-thurs 9-530 friday 9-5.  no saturdays and no sundays and NO NIGHTS.  also after tax season every year he usually takes everyone in the office on some trip or something...like in august everyone gets to go on a cruise to the bahamas...FOR FREE.  he pays for everything.  also if as i go through the accounting program i get raises.  once i complete my associates i get a raise then at bachelors...then masters another raise.  talk about a good steady job that has great hours...and i get paid well for someone my age and experience.  
AND THATS NOT ALL...
i also have a job working with a band promoter as her assistant who sets up shows and goes on the tours etc etc with the bands and such...which is way awesome.  i might get to go on the mini tour this thurs-sat with everyone-shes just making sure i can and everything and checking up on all that and she'll let me know tomorrow...if that happens i get to pack my bags real quick and leave for a show with 6 bands playing in gainesville, then a show friday in jacksonville, then to orlando on saturday with the bands...if not...theres always next time.

all this means i can afford a nice apartment for myself...go to FMU and take all my accounting courses online...work a good 9-5 job that has more than potential to grow and get better...and i get to do it all while hanging out with awesome musicians and growing in my own music with them all helping me... 

so i guess i'm staying in florida.  i'd be stupid not to.  look at all i'd have to give up.  to go back to what...?

nothing."

"event","i'm here.

the drive wasn't bad.  i made good time.

<i>for someone who begged me to still be their friend after the breakup and who made me promise to still talk to him and be a part of his life you sure act like you could care less.  or maybe it makes you feel good if someone comes to you and you have to do nothing.  well i'm not doing it anymore.</i>

been pretty busy.  karoke, bands, restaurants, the new kitten...the place wendy owns has bands coming in every weekend and so its been fun to meet them and get to see them all play and such. crazyness.

we picked up lian's extremely young kitten.  she's 5 weeks old.  she pretty cute but kinda a handful sometimes with how much attention she craves and how much you have to watch her and keep her from getting into everything like she tries to do.

i think i'm visiting with my older sister some this weekend. that should be fun.  saw my aunt jo this past weekend.  

trying to get into a good excersize routine.  bike riding early in the morning is the plan.  then maybe walking some in the evening.  we'll see.

everyone is trying to cinvince me to move down here.  i don't want to i don't think.  its kinda bothering me cause if i really wanted to would the7 even need to so any convincing.  i don't know where i want to be.  i don't feel like i belong anywhere.  bvut i'm the most free in virginia.  its fun here getting to do all this stuff but...i'm not as free.  atleast not right now.  that might have to do with the fact that i have no friends but...i don't know.

we'll see."

"event","i feel bad for the next guy who falls in love with me...for the next guy who even trys to date me.  its not exactly a good thing that my first true relationship was amazing and that i truly fell fully in love with him-that we were in in love with eachother.  hes always going to be the one i compare every next guy to and i'll expect a lot from him.   and its not that he won't be as good but its going to be hard to make someone feel the same way he made me feel when we were together.  its hard to match up to ones first love and i'm afraid that no matter how much i love the next guy i'll never love him the way i loved eric and even worse that he will be able to tell.  it'd be like a...a big....huge...fat...hippopotomus sitting in the room with us all the time. i don't know i just find this frightening for me and i think about it a lot.  it doesn't help that this has been part of the reason i haven't dated anyone really.  everytime i get the option i turn it down before i barely consider it.  the next guy is going to have to have me from the start-there is no letting him grow on me....

i really hope that this doesn't happen once i do find someone i want to date but...i'm scared it might."

when my window is open
i hear a train go by around 4 AM
i don't know if it is my imaginiation
or if we really have trains that close to here
i think its real though
it reminds me of you
and how it would wake us up
we hated it
but somehow
i think i loved it a little
at the same time
it was ours
a memory
unconventional
like most of our memories
we had the memories of fairy tales
the kind of things you saw in romantic comedies
the things that don't happen in real life...."

"event","my sister was in this past weekend.  it was nice.  its sucked though that i was sick for most of it.  oh well though.  mainly hung out at holly's cause erica's bridal shower was on saturday.  got coffee with scotti on saturday night.  had lunch with my brother on sunday.  those were the only two times we weren't at holly's house.  except for a lunch excursion that i went on with Holly's husband rob while holly and tonia were shopping for the shower on saturday afternoon.  we got gyros downtown and then got coffee at mill mountain.  this is boring babble.

i am unsure as to my plans for this summer.  it might be smart to go to florida to save up some money then come back here and get an apartment later on closer to the beginning of the school year but i don't know what i'd do with all my stuff while i was down there if i did that unless i paid for a storage facility.  but then again it could end up being kind of a pain in the ass to do that also.  i'll call and talk to my mum and see what she thinks.  also i need to see about my work.  if i get the raise i was supposed to get forever ago i'll stay.  if not i might as well leave cause i can easily go somewhere else, work the same number of hours and get a lot more.  ah-its all so complicated-more complicated than what i have written here but i don't feel like typing about it anymore.

though i am ready for this semesterr to be over i am not ready to have to move out of here at hollins cause i seriously have no idea what i am going to do with all my stuff-i might need to do some talking to my brother unless i find an apartment quick.

i really need to figure out what i am doing-i only have until may 15th. to get everything straight before i have to be moved out of hollins..........."

"event","so my lovely car died again.

saw erics band on tuesday night-their last show being 2 of the guys are graduating.  they did well.

went to macrock on friday.  that was fun.

eric showed me some new stuff on guitar.

worked a 10 and a half hour shift at work last night.  5:30 PM-4:00 AM ---- that was extremely NOT awesome haha.

i want to find someone who plays acoustic guitar that would want to do acoustic sets with me where we both or i sing and i could play some stuff on the guitar also but i'm not that advanced so it would have to be simple stuff that i played.  i think it would be fun and i'd like to get out and do something like that.  i'm bored.  all i do is work and go to class and occasionally go out.  this past week was the eception cause i actually did some stuff extremely OUT of the ordinary.

blah blah blah...ok, back to practicing my song for voice on thursday."

so a real update...i'm going to try.

classes are going well-its only a third into the semester though so...haha.  work is alright-working upstairs is nice so yea.  i'm rather busy with all the work and full time student stuff but yea...usually my only time off is sunday all day, monday night and friday night.  classes monday through thursday morning-afternoon, one class friday morning, work tuesday night, wednesday night, thursday night, friday morning and saturday night.  most every friday is hanging out with stacy until 4 or 5 AM and then sleeping in saturday til work then out late saturday with ash and stacy sleep in sunday then relax all to begin the week on monday and monday evening is usually for errands and sometimes taking CT to a movie.  pretty soon it seems david might be getting himself in there a little more often and on a regular basis but...we'll see how things progress with him.  haha.  got a new tattoo that i guess could be considered two -because it is on both arms- but for me it was one.  a poem i made that is only complete when you put the two arms together.  it took me some time to put together and a lot of research but i like it a lot.  i'll post some pictures in a bit once i get around to taking a picture of it.

another amazing room mate amanda quote--
[reading a paper that says ""YAM EVENTS""]
me--""what is Y A M""  [meaning what does it stand for]
amanda--[staring into space] ""Yam....i like yams""  [continues to stare into space]
me--""umm amanda...hahaha""
amanda--""what i was thinking about yams""

it doesn't sound as funny written there but it was great.  haha"

"event","its all how you look at it and what you do with the day.  why whine when you can call your mom and best friends and tell them you love them-celebrate the day in some way just by wishing everyone the best?  and does it really have to be different than any other day if you don't want it to be?  no not really-unless you're with someone and then its an amazing chance to do something special and tell eachother how much you do mean to eachother, on a higher level and on different circumstances than we do from day to day.  just because you have a boyfriend or girlfriend doesn't mean you both don't deserve a day to celebrate. a bad attitude towards valentines day is just an example of bitterness and in a way a childish view of the whole holiday-if you ask me and i'm not saying this from the point of view of someone who went out with a boyfriend or anything-i worked tonight.  and that is only <b>my</b> opinion so if you try to comment telling me how wrong i am or explaining why you can and should hate valentines day- expect to get ignored --you can have your opinion as i said i have mine.  :]

first week in the new position.  it is going well, worked tonight-everythng ran well.

hanging out with david tomorrow is the plan :]  then work."

"event","i realized some things for myself this weekend.  it was nice.

saturday was...alright.  not bad really-nothing too amazing.  i had fun with stacy earlier in the day.  first i catered to my brother and then he dropped me off at her house i should say.  we went to lunch at mama marias-it was great.  i enjoyed just sitting and talking like we have been more recently and like we used to.  i missed that i think even though i didn't really realize it until i noticed how nice it felt to be doing it again.  i'll have to thank her for being around.  [making mental note....]  okay anyways then we went to the mall and i did my usual walking the whole circle top and then bottm and only walking into the bookstore, journeys to admire the pair of pumas i want so badly but i refuse to pay 70 dollars for a pair of shoes-always checking the price hoping they're cheaper and stopping to look at the knives.  we left there cause i picked nothing out for her to buy me for my birthday and went to best buy.  in there i found kung fu hustle-which i love and she bought it for me....i was thoroughly pleased.  i bought ong bak for myself.  i have waned to see it and it was only 15 dollars...and the guy in the movie is crazy...no stunt double or special stuff like that....i'm sure i'll like it. after that she brough me back to hollins and i hung out with rachael for a few before mike and eric showed up.  we came back to my room and hung out some then went to eat at famous anthony's. brandon showed up while we were there and we talked for a bit.  after this we went back to the dorm and talked in my room some more.  next to play pool downstairs.  then to the fire with a bunch of hollins girls.  hung around there for a good amount of time actually.  back to the dorm and watched austin powers...then some of eternal sunshine for the spotless mind.  during these two movies slowly we lost people.  brandon left during austin powers and eric fell asleep as eternal started and basically we never finished eternal cause mike and i fell asleep at some tie during this...this morning eric and i were up before mike so we sat in the community room and talked.  then we drank some tea while and eric also had some ramen.  shortly after mike came about and they got ready and left for JMU.  i have since them talked on the phone with a few peple and gotten dressed.  and done this.  and listened to music.

that is a boring summary.  list list list.

oh well anyways, i think i might go play some piano and sing...maybe.  yes.  or read.  one of the two...or both.  haha.

it is rainging outside."

You take a while to fall in love with someone. Trust takes time.

You give and take equally in relationships.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>


i'm enjoying short term.  i like my class-politics &/through film.  its interesting and its cool to be in a class with my romm mate.  she helps me to stay on top of things.  :

it looks like i am going to get to stay at hollins for atleast one more semester.  :]  i'm really glad about this.

i knew that if i kept telling myself that eventually things had to start getting better being they just kept getting worse-it can only go so far own before it can go back p-that eventually things might start to work themselves out.  hopefully it kepps going and getting better.  hopefully.

i'm scared about my birthday...mainly because its always ruined when i try to do anything with more than one or two people and if any of them aren't close friends.  last year was the first time since the 4th grade where my birthday was good and thats cause eric and i hardly celebrated it...no cake nothing-just a simple present from him and that was the only mention of it...i'm scared cause eric is bringing mike and its not that i don't want to hang out with mike or want him to visit...i just am scared because this is the same kind of innocent group thing where something ends up happeneing and i'm not saying mike will do anyting...its just...the whole group thing or planing thing.  its hard to explain.  like i wanted to hardly celebrate it and if i do anything i wanted it to be only with a close friend or two...and i just...i wish he would have told me before he invited mike so we could have talked about it some because now i feel kinda trapped into it...but...i am hoping that things work out ok..."

After you've gone and left me crying, after you've gone - there's no denying
You'll feel blue - you're gonna be sad
You've missed the dearest pal that you ever had

There'll come a time - when you're gonna regret it
Some day when you get lonely
Your heart will break like mine - you'll want me only.
After you've gone- after you've gone away 
After we paid - our dues together
You should have stayed - through all that nasty weather
Someday while you're feeling badly
You'll need the only one that loves you so madly
But I'll be gone - yes I'll be gone - to stay
Yeah after I've gone - after I've gone away"

You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and free.

In love, you feel the most alive when your lover is creative and never lets you feel bored.

You'd like to your lover to think you are loyal and faithful... that you'll never change.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was insecure and in constant need of reassurance.

Your ideal relationship is lasting. You want a relationship that looks to the future... one you can grow with.

Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about society and morality. You would never break a commitment.

You think of marriage as something precious. You'll treasure marriage and treat it as sacred.

In this moment, you think of love as something you thirst for. You'll do anything for love, but you won't fall for it easily.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/keystoyourheartquiz/"">What Are The Keys To Your Heart?</a></div>"

the last night john IMed me and was like YO! lets go to PA tomorrow and get fireworks. of course i was down. well i found out my mom was picking me up from school...FUCK. so i had to find a fireworks store in NH or CT somewher close. he gets here at about 7:15, we hit dunkin donuts and our journy begins. we arrive at Phantom Fireworks (TM). Yah kno? the one advertised on 91north. yeah so we get there and this bitchy lady is like IDENTIFICATION PLEASE. so he shows her and shes like umm scuse me , you gosta be 21 sir. BYE BYE. so we leave and go to walmart which is a few minutes down. we walk around there until we found a victim. john asks this dude to buy us fireworks and he aggrees. so we get to the store again and the people are suspicious. john finds the package he wants, and we are ready to pay. well i go to the car to get the coupons and i see the dude dart out. he comes up to me and hes like sorry guys its wicked unsafe. AND I QUOTE, a grown man say ""WICKED UNSAFE"" to me. she was on the phone with the cops. oh great. we go back to walmart to look for someone else. we see this ""badass"" looking guy and we talk to him about buying us some goods. he was an asshole. anyways, we head back home and i decided we should go to CT and see what they have. it wasnt that bad and he bought something neat... buy one get one free so thats always good. then we go to visit my cousin at falcetis and head back to the school. OF COURSE john decides to come in with me...nice this is good. i walk down g hall and guess whos heading right toward me. you got it, MR. WALEN. ""boys can i see your passes"" john is like im going to guidance but im a senior. great this sets me up. mr.walen is like andy come with me. so hes like im guessing you skipped school with john. we'll have to call your mother about this one. ""oh fuck"" i think. so we get there and whaddayah know. i get 2 fucking suspensions. GREAT FUN!! oh well thats my day.

lost in tides your profound gace
a  memory of your smiling face
it packed a punch too hard to take
god must've made a mistake
i dont think i can ever sleep
wish that you were here with me
but instead your in the light
a battle lost, we failed the fight

but i know your in a better place 
its something i just have to face
theres nothing left that i can do
but i know that i'll miss you

even though you are gone
your soul will always live on
the memories shining through
i may never shed a tear
but i know my soul is crying 

they say there's a plan
but this plan isnt right
never made it to your sweet 16
how is this a plan?
friends are wounded forever
a daughter lost for eternity
but your angel looking from above
this isnt how the story should end

if only we had one more day
we could say our goodbyes 
its hard to breathe knowing you're not here


even though you are gone
your soul will always live on
the memories shining through
i may never shed a tear
but i know my soul is crying 


goodbye kate"

"event","you steal these, i stab you.

this home is not enough
the shelter beres no hope
your broken lies and promises
left unsaid
the world is raining chaos on my head
our empty hearts and empty soul
life better off dead
but times are changing
a revolution needs to come
but times are changing
i wish icant save the world

the world is getting smaller
tides are clashing on the shore
leaders at each others throats
no one ever knows
whats life without problems
a wish to peace of mind
but then again impossible 
in these dark and hopeless times
fourty seven hours in darkness and despair
searching for the answers that were never there
fourty seven hours sitting in peace so i stare 
living without answers, living without care

break from the surface
rise from the ground
losing control you let me down
trying to fight the storm away
erosion in society
are minds aren't thinking clear
is there hope?
not enough
pray to change
but we aren't tough
tough to fight through it all
but no
we are too far to turn back
cannot look behind
cannot turn back time

what we're going through
we cannot go alone
cannot fight the storm
the times we're living through
we can feel but we cannot do
the things that hold us back
cannot, cannot dissapear

<i>friends influence friends</i>
yesturday i saw that anti drug commerical. the one that says friendship is the best anti drug and the girl is drowning. that really put everything into perspective for me. i have an even better perception for life right now. im glad that i learned the truth about drugs although i didnt learn it the easiest way. i guess the best way for me to learn shit is to experiance it first hand. thats a bad thing...but im trying to grow away from it. being friends with people like sharon has also brought things into perspective. some people just cant realize the truth and cant appriciate shit. people like that need to open their eyes and come back to reality.people like that dont understand true friendship. friendship isnt a bunch of kids you go on a blunt route with, get sexually harassed, and do favors for. ok im done ranting and raving about that.

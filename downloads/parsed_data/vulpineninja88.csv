My Visual Arts Folio is almost completed!! The teacher gave me 85/100 for it ^_^v
I did not come on Wednesday just to finish the Course Work. Today when i meet her she was suddenly being nice.. (wth?). and sympathetic. She told me to touch up the work a bit and take a break. D'uh, i worked till morning!
Now i had to pass it up on Monday.. fuuh...
i don't regret taking V.A. but i regret being such a lazy arse...

Got Chemistry test today. geez, i did not read, but thank God i can remember bits of it. we all did a last minute revision. Poor friends, they all are so blur blur about it... i had to help Jo a bit to make her understand...

Tomorrow, we got Modern Maths test!! Phew, good thing that the topics are quite easy. Just need to take a look at it for a while.

Seriously, i don't think my guy should take comments too personally. Somebody said that his artwork is boring. Hell no! It's damn interesting, especially the backgrounds! Majority, more people love his work, man! I envy his talent as well!"

"event","Me and my group members are supposed to practice our presentation after school...we have to do a drama. We have to practice because tomorrow might be the presentation day (the teacher din say when). But two of the members were not serious. They were always laughing and joking around. I don't mind a bit of laugh but they were going overboard. we often joke a bit in the middle of the practice... but when it comes to them they'd laugh for like... 10 minutes before we could continue. It's not the first time it becomes like this. I knew if i work with them again another job is gonna have so much delay. My character is supposed to talk to theirs but when I talk they were busy talking to each other...

If our presentation turns out really lame It would not be my fault. The hell i care anyway.
I got so pissed off, I just went home without finishing the rehearsal. If there weren't any practice I'd rather go home than waste my time there.

Stupid... can't they just get a bit more serious? i mean... gez, I can't do anything. I hate to show my temper. I only kept quiet and put on an angry face. Lucky my friend blue_moon15 didn't come. She'd kill those two if she was there."

"event","Me and my friends, including blue_moon15 (we're editors) did the English Newsletter during English Month on March 2005. We finished it at the end of the month and passed it up to the English teacher. BUT, the headmistress refuses to publish it because she said, ""it's not worth it"".

WTF!?! NOT WORTH IT?? HELLO! Me and the rest of the editorial board worked hard in completing it!! And you say it's not worth it? All of our effort is just wasted like that? geez. That is when I started disliking the headmistress.

But the English teacher still insisted on publishing it. Bless her (but she ain't my fave either). So, finally, today the teacher told the editorial board that the newsletter is gonna be published! Cool...."

I was looking at this really nasty french magazine that my english teacher had lying around for ssr. It was nothing but boobs, perfume samples and sex stories. Now I know why he keeps them around. That sick perverted freak... Note to Brittany: Your lovely drawing of me is hanging up. AND IM GONNA KILL YOU BRITTANY! YOU NEVER MET ME AFTER SCHOOL TO DO THE ALCOHOL AND DRUG CLASS! Well Ive only got myself one little bit of good news. Me friend Jesse, got me a job and I get like 7 bucks an hour plus under the table pay, whatever that is. I guess tips.  But Im really excited.

Cept when Brittany threw my backpack which ahd my iPod in it which fucked it up, so now I dont know how to replace it. Thanks... I REALLY needed that. My friend Aliicia and Farra want to give me a makeover because I dont wear enough color. What I wear shouldnt be of their concern, I mean, what I wear is how Im expressing myself and they should let me express myself that way this whole phase will end sooner, but they just dont get that. I just cant stop thinking about my birthday, and once again, today I forgot to go to the office and sign up for that alcohol and drug class for my license permit thingy. I hope I dont forget again. Im still dying to go to Tates. I want Taco Bell but I feel like if I eat anything I might projectile vomit everywhere. I wish I could go to the mall and just buy like 600.00 worth of crap. I havent shopped for the longest time. Well thats about all for today. I hope myself feels better later on."

"event","I cant wait until my birthday. I been thinkin aboot it a lot the last few days. I think Im going to go to a Disturbed concert for it, though I dont think theyve planned one that late yet... But I really wan go. But then again, I dont know anyone else who likes Disturbed and will actually enjoy it. I mean, me best friend likes techno and rap. The only problem with going to one of their concerts, is that everyone will be drunk there, not as if thats a problem, but that mean im probably going to get harrassed and felt up while in the crowd cuz the fans are gon be so drunk and high. Well i guess Ill figure it out when it comes around... My friend wrote this really cool story. Here it is if you wan read it, if you dont, then dont bother scrolling down. 

By Chris K. 
Chris:This is a story that I decided to re-post because its amazing. Read it again.

10th grade ********** 

As I sat there in English class, 

I stared at the girl next to me. 

She was my so called 'best friend'. 

I stared at her long, silky hair, 

and wished she was mine. 

But she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. 

after class, she walked up to me 

and asked me for the notes 

she had missed the day before. 

I handed them to her. 

She said 'thanks' and gave me a kiss on the cheek. 

I want to tell her, 

I want her to know that 

I dont want to be just friends, 

I love her 

but I'm just too shy, 

and I dont know why.



11th grade ********** 



The phone rang. 

On the other end, 

it was her. 

She was in tears, 

mumbling on and on about how 

her love had broke her heart. 

She asked me to come over 

because she didn't want to be alone, 

so I did. 

As I sat next to her on the sofa, 

I stared at her soft eyes, 

wishing she was mine. 

After 2 hours, 

one Drew Barrymore movie, 

and three bags of chips, 

she decided to go to sleep. 

She looked at me, 

said 'thanks' 

and gave me a kiss on the cheek. 

I want to tell her, 

I want her to know 

that I don't want to be just friends, 

I love her 

but I'm just too shy, 

and I dont know why. 

Senior year *********** 

The day before prom 

she walked to my locker. 

""My date is sick"" she said, ""he's not gonna go"" 

well, I didn't have a date, 

and in 7th grade, we made a promise 

that if neither of us had dates, 

we would go together just as 'best friends'. 

So we did. 

Prom night, after everything was over, 

I was standing at her front door step. 

I stared at her as she smiled at me 

and stared at me with her crystal eyes. 

I want her to be mine, 

but she doesn't think of me like that, 

and I know it. 

Then she said- ""I had the best time,thanks!"" 

and gave me a kiss on the cheek. 

I want to tell her, 

I want her to know that 

I dont want to be just friends, 

I love her but 

I'm just too shy, 

and I don't know why. 

A day passed, then a week,then a month. 

Before I could blink, it was graduation day. 

I watched as her perfect body floated like an angel 

up on stage to get her diploma. 

I wanted her to be mine- 

but she didn't notice me like that, 

and I knew it. 

Before everyone went home, 

she came to me in her smock and hat, 

and cried as I hugged her. 

Then she lifted her head 

from my shoulder and said- 

'you're my best friend,thanks' 

and gave me a kiss on the cheek. 

I want to tell her, 

I want her to know 

that I dont want to be just friends, 

I love her but I'm just too shy, 

and I don't know why. 

Now I sit in the pews of the church. 

That girl is getting married now. 

I watched her say 'I do' 

and drive off to her new life, 

married to another man. 

I wanted her to be mine, 

but she didn't see me like that, 

and I knew it. 

But before she drove away, 

she came to me and said 'you came!'. 

She said 'thanks' 

and kissed me on the cheek. 

I want to tell her, 

I want her to know 

that I dont want to be just friends, 

I love her 

but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why. 

Years passed, 

I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my 'best friend'. 

At the service, they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years. 

This is what it read: 

""I stare at him wishing he was mine; but he doesn't notice me like that, and I know it. I want to tell him, I want him to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love him but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why. I wish he would tell me he loved me!"" 

'I wish I did too...' I thought to myself, and I cried.

Now, not too many people in this world understand this message. People just don't get that the person you love, the friend that is always there, might not be there tomorrow, it is never guaranteed, tell someone how you feel about them. And, wake up and live life in the present, do not sulk in the past. That is a lesson that I've learned from the past 8 years of my life. From the accident until this very moment, all the help that I've gotten all the sorrow that I put people through to get to this one moment, I'd say that its been worth it because of the outcome now. Today was supposed to be my 'Silent Chris' day, I forgot about it completely because I was having a good day. 

So, be happy, give someone a high five or a hug. It'll make both feel good."

"event","Yo. Im actually going to write in here finally. What Brittany says is true. Im not exaclty sure why we thought we were going to get away with bringing food into the movie theatre, but hey, it was worth a shot. But in any case, Boogeyman was excellent. I actually got scared. This is actually my second time writing this, my pc shut off last night before I could sumbit my entry. But whatever. I feel like such  bad friend right now. Because my friend Luis went into the hospital on Monday to get surgery done and he wanted me to come see him or bring him something because he knew no one else would. But I was home sick from school on monday so I guess I have somewhat of an excuse. But the bad part is, I didnt remember until last night...so... a week went by and I didnt even call to see if he was okay. I dont know why but Sims is getting to me. I downloaded all of this new stuff that was really cool for the game, but now I have so many families I dont know which ones to use. And my old families I cant change and give the new items to and I really want to change them! But I cant. So, i think Im going to get rid of them all and start fresh. Im having Tates withdrawl right now because Im dying to go there and get a few new books and some Pucaas. Theyre quite yummy. I also need to get a few more pocket demons because I cant find my other ones. I made them into earrings. lol. I have nothing to do this weekend. But the good news is, Im going to be 16 this year. It really doesnt feel like it, but at least I get my drivers license and that means I cant take myself to Tates anytime I want! But Ill need a job for gasmoney and books... Oh well. I need to get a haircut. ""Napolean, Im sure theres a babe out there for you. Peace out."""

I had a really hectic day with sims. I got really mad at the computer, but Im in the middle of something really bad. Or at least I think its bad... If a girl is pregnant with her 2nd child with the same guy, is it wrong for another guy to sleep with her? Well thtas whats happeneing in my game right now. AND I think I have a lesbian Sim on my hands. She refuses to kiss or flirt with any guys. So... Im dying to go to Tates right now and but Death Note and some other meaninglesss crap that I probably dont need, but hey, it makes me feel better."

Then my mom starts to date again, well actually its not really dating. Its more like ""sleep with me"" dating. Shes such a frickin slut. I would like to go with my friend Jesse to one of his shows cause hes in the band Montag, but I can see thats never going to happen. My friend Luis aka Loomis is going to have surgery done. He ripped the cartilage in his shoulder while playing football. He wants me to visit him in the hospital cause no on else will. Since hes injured maybe I'll build him a cake or something...as a little get well gift. lol. But anyways. Against my will, Im being forced to go to Laser Quest with my ex, Farra, Brittany, Katie aka K Tizzle, lol, and a few other people. Fun. I really hate Laser Quest. I mean I really really loathe it...... but at least I get to be with me friends, right? Well anyways, Im kinda sick right now because I just ate this really nasty soup for dinner and I think Im gonna go hurl it up. I feel like shyt right now. I mean I had a confrontation with my moms fuck buddy and I havent had the chance to brush my hair. I think Im gonna play sims. Talk with myself later."

But after I got home Farra gave me the details on what happened while she was at Brittanys house. I was suppossed to have gone  but I had to watch my sister at my dads house >:0 . I sat there for 9 hours watching The Villiage, Shaun of the Dead and Napolean Dynamite eating Trix cereal.But while they were there they were online in chatrooms messing with guys and asking them to call her and then theyd insult them and hang up. It was really funni. Then Farra, Brittany, and Tyler all went to the park and went on the swings and stuff. But last night was awesome! Me Farra and her brother went to see White Noise. When it was over we were in the parking lot waiting for the bus, but we were pulling each other in shopping carts and pushing each other into garbage cans with them and junk. Then a security gaurd came over and said "" You guys are drunk, you shouldnt be over here."" Then he says if we needed anything to come get him.And then he drove away. But we were ""drunk"" so we dint care if he told us to go wait by the entrance or whateva he sed to do. It was hilareeus.But now weve all got bruises where we crashed and I ache all over from god knows what. But I need to go to the doctor to get an x-ray of the inside of my stomach cuz i need ta know if the hole is any bigger.(and if ya dint no that i had a hole on the inside of me,ya do now.)its from stress.a lots happened over the past few years."

But after school,me and me friend walked home which took like 2 hours and we were dying from the heat. We decided to stop off at our friend Brians house to chill and see his cat. We messed around on his carpet and raided his fridge. There wasnt anything fattening.lol.We decided to wait for a few minutes til Farras brother came home and Bruce so we could walk to Taco Bell for sum junk food. As we were walking there we stopped by Ralphs house only to find some old scooters. Brian, Bruce, and Bobby(her brother a.k.a Bobbay)took them and did all these crazy jumps and fell and almost killed themselves.lol. it was pretty funny.After wards while we were starting to walk back from T.B. Brian poured his soda on me friend and so I bought a drink and she poured it all over him. sweet revenge>:)buahahahahaaaa Anyhoo. Me and Farra hung out in front of Bruces petting his cute puppy while they crashed into each other and garbage cans with their newly found scooters. It started to get late and I wanted to go take a shower so me and her left to her house where we touched up part 10 of her quiz: Would you kiss a werewolf? Its really good, you should take them.

P.S. Chris, if you ever read my journal you will know the mistake you made. You spelled Pocahontas wrong on one of your entries when you were typing in the music portion. You said that your music was Colors of the wind, and you spelled her name wrong. FIX IT!!!! lol

I could really go for some Taco Bell right now."

"event","Why did I have to have a sister?!?! Today Im suppossed to be going to see White Noise with my friends and now I cant go because I have to watch my frickin sister who Im 10 years older than. I notice how my brother gets to come at 5:30 in the morning everyday after hanging with his band for hours but I cant have some fun before I go back to school!!!! I was really looking forward to tonite cuz this really hot guy is going that I have a crush on. But in any case the fact doesnt change that I cant go. Ive tried to hire a babysitter but all of the ones I know are working and this sucks. Well, I hope my friends will tell me all about the movie. I wont be leaving anytime soon."

"event","Today was sooooo frickin frustrating! I was playing Sims2,cuz i love that game and all the other ones, and this guy I was controlling started to make out with the maid and then his knocked up wife came in and caught him and they got in a cat fight and they were shoving each other and all this stuff and I couldnt stop them cuz it was on Free Will,and it was just a huge fiasco. I dont want to go back to school. Im enjoying being a lazy computer potato (i cant say couch potato cuz im at a chair)but anyhoo... Im going to see White Noise tomorrow with Loomis, Ralph maybe, Brian, Bobbay, me friend Farra and maybe sum other ppl but Im not exactly sure yet. Im dying to see Boogeyman! I found a whole bunch of cool sprites today!Im reading these comics on 8-bit Theatre and they are the shiznit! Though, Ive missed up on some reading...aboot 3 months worth.....but thats not the point! 

My freind and I have been creating these quizzes called :Would you kiss a Werewolf? and theres parts 1-8. They are very good, but unfortunately are for girls only. Unless you are a guy who likes to read about some girl practically getting raped by this hot guy she loves in a greenhouse.

TAKE THESE QUIZZES OR ILL CASTRATE YOUR GRANDMA!lol But really, they arent bad. I guess I overexaggerated a tad bit.

But today wasnt bad, I caught up with some friends online and shared a bowl of mashed potatoes with my cat. But now I think Im gonna go watch some movies I rented. Au revior."

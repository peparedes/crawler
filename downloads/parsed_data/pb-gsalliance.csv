"event","Alrighty people the school year is underway and we've got some updates:

Well we've lost our original advisors; Mrs. Ganely and Ms. Bass are no longer our advisors, they've decided to take up Sophmore Class. 

But have no fear, just as we have lost, we have gained. We already have two new advisors, Dr. Leibovitch and Ms. McDonald. *claps*. They are quite eager to help and get this started ASAP. And in the few days we've gained them as advisors we've accomplished a lot. They've already talked with Mrs. Greene, our new principal, who is also willing to help us get this started. They've also made some calls to other schools with GSA's and we're just waiting for callbacks. We're hoping to have this started by at least the winter. And it'll be a full fledged recognized club with an account and in the budget next year.

Although we have a request of you, the reader, GLBTQ youth. If you or someone you know has been harassed, someone has made offending comments regarding sexuality or sexual orientation we need to know. We've been asked to get accounts of harassment and/or violence taken against GLBTQ youth. So if you could, please email it to us so we can get it to them. The more accounts, the more it shows that we need it in our school, and the faster things'll get moving."

"event","Hey everyone, 
  PBGSA here, and the school year's just started for those of you who attend Pine Bush High School or any of the schools located within the district. We're still in the process of getting the o-kay from Administration for actually holding meetings on school property, but in the meantime we can make this our community. We hope you've been checking out the sites we listed and are helping to get the word out. We have a lot of expectations for the GSA and some things we'd like to see happen, but nothing can happen without support and members. We hope things are going well with those of you who have just entered into a new school year. If you have any problems, concerns, comments or questions don't hesitate to contact us. We will respond in a timely fashion.

^_^

Sincerely, 
PBGSA"

I am taking a new approach. Using the methods I have learnt in the AJ Rochester book ""A Lazy Girls Guide to Losing Weight and Getting Fit"", I am dragging Cory along for the ride in the weight loss train. 

Tomorrow my journal entries will start again, along with my exercise. I will not use the word ""DIET"" because I will be working hard to be the best I can be. 

My Pledge *courtesy of AJ's book*: 

""I commit myself to being the very best that I can be. I deserve to love, be loved and most importantly of all, to love myself. I deserve a healthy bod and I will never gie up on myself, no matter what happens, and I promise to do whatever it takes to make it happen. Today is the first day of the rest of my life. SHAZAM!"""

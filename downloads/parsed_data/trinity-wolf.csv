"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, living in Louisiana and the weather being horrid atm, it is raining and muddy.&nbsp; I happen to have a dog and he likes to go outside.&nbsp; He goes outside and comes back covered in mud.&nbsp; So, twas bath time.&nbsp; I forget what I update on, but Boudreaux is a pitt and about 7 1/2 months old now and not in the least bit aggressive.&nbsp; But anyways, he hates baths.&nbsp; He always tries to jump out and ends up scratchin up my legs as well as soaking myself and the floor.&nbsp; So, I have this breakthrough.&nbsp; Why dont we shower together?&nbsp; So we did, and he didnt put up any fight.&nbsp; I suppose the curtains confused him.&nbsp; And so now we are all clean and whatnot.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other news, I took the SAT last Saturday.&nbsp; Scores will be in on the 14th of this month.&nbsp; &gt;.&lt;&nbsp; I'll post the scores if they're decent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also re-reading the 5th through 7th Harry Potter books.&nbsp; Actually, I have yet to read the 7th one because I forgot most of the 6th one and am just re-reading the 5th one because I feel like it.&nbsp; It's been a while since Harry and I have had our quality time together.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmmm... ah!&nbsp; My mate's birthday is coming up on the 26th. w00t!&nbsp; He'll be legal.&nbsp; But, I need to save money for a present and Valentines. &gt;.&lt; I have $45 put back. O.O
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, I shall go scour the interweb for Tool and Avenged Sevenfold stickers!!!!!"

"event","So, today wasn't half as bad as the morning foretold.&nbsp; When I woke up this morning and went to shower the only towels in there were the little barely-cover-your-ass towels.&nbsp; I get back in my room to find that my dog not only shit in my room but on my Cosmo magazine which I had yet to read.&nbsp; I was spazzin because I couldn't find my Sudafex which is what is keeping me awake and functioning atm.&nbsp; Get to school only to walk through the rain and then my boyfriend isn't there.
It got better though ^_^&nbsp; Did great on all of that Chemistry stuff we did today.&nbsp; Which btw and Louisiana HS aged furs, I should be at literary rally either in Chem, Spanish, or some other random subject. w00t.&nbsp; So hit me up if you wanna meet up ^_^&nbsp; Anyways, we didn't have to take our test in Sport's Medicine, which wasn't really a big deal because I knew it all anyways...&nbsp; got to 7th hour and had to make up a test that I missed (American History).&nbsp; My teacher sent my friend Ashley and I to another room so it would be quiet, and we cheated out asses off.&nbsp; I got an A. ^_^
I also got to baby-sit tonight, not much for kids, but I like money.&nbsp; I also cleaned out Smittie's (my bearded dragon) cage and put him a huge water bowl/tub type thing.&nbsp; Happeh lizard ^_^
And here I sit in my bed drinking a vanilla coke and feeling great because my dog shitting in my room inspired me to clean everything else in here ^_^&nbsp; 
So yea.&nbsp; I do believe I'm going to bed&nbsp; now.&nbsp; Doubt anyone actually reads this but blah.&nbsp; G'night!"

"event","Hiya! &nbsp; So, yea today was pretty great.&nbsp; I got to go horse ridin! ^_^&nbsp; I love to ride.&nbsp; Such a great feeling.&nbsp; I think I got sunburnt a bit, but it was soooo worth it!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, yesterday I went to go watch Cloverfield and I liked it.&nbsp; Everybody I was with hated it, but I thought it was great.&nbsp; Refreshing new idea.&nbsp; Kept you in suspense the entire time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sick =(&nbsp; I left school Friday because I felt so bad I was crying.&nbsp; Then on the way home cue anxiety attack!&nbsp; I stress too much &gt;.&lt;&nbsp; But my mommy is takin care of me and givin me all this good medicine and I feel alot better now.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am getting a pawprint sticker for my car ^_^&nbsp; Which, if I haven't posted, is a tan '03 Ford Escape.&nbsp; She's great.&nbsp; Have yet to name her though...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here I sit watching about full-body tattoos on National Geographic.&nbsp; I watched ""A Man Among Wolves"" on there today.&nbsp; It was pretty great.&nbsp; It's amazing how in tune he is with his pack.&nbsp; I probably sound like an idiot, but oh well ^_^
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want a tattoo.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm tired and rambling.&nbsp; I'm going to bed.&nbsp; Good night."

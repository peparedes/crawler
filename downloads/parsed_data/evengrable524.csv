"event","yesterday was fun!
the mexican pizza was worth waiting for kari to find her way out of the catacomb subdivisions behind lakeside---yay for delicious!---then i got my first Christmas presents of the year and all is well cause i found the ""dress up the Supreme Court Judges"" page in the America book, lots of fun stuff, i can't wait to watch my movies:) --my noir leather bracelet got caught in my hair while playing trivial pursuit and just kinda hung from my head for a while until kari got detached it most of it(eventually i did have to just yank it out with a few strands)---the fondue was excellent and the cat was crazy fun...i hope erin likes my t-shirt! ---i gotta go to royal oak again now to turn in all my paperwork so is i gets paid---yeah"

"event","it's silly updating this thing really...

i've gotten a lot done this week so far as work is concerned and its all very exciting so i know i'll be blabbing about it until it becomes old habit...after heading to mcnichols(6 mile for the suburbanites) and livernois to take care of some business of sending out old UDM transcripts to the proper authorities i went up the road to royal oak to do some reading and work done.  i went to an indie cafe called cafe de marquis and i ordered a peanut butter cup latte and it was mighty fine and foamy. the down side was that you could smoke in there and a dude just kept lighting up and it became a bit overwhelming by the time i left; i will still go back next time i'm around though....i did some x-mas shopping too at kohl's nightowl sale which wasn't as busy as i was expecting, so yay!"

"event","Random Stuff from the past couple days in no particular order:

--Saw two guys blatantly abuse the privilege of the free bread at panera: they each a napkin full samples,doused them in dipping sauce, sat down, and went back 10 mins later for second helpings, Jesus-tap-dancing-Christ buy a bagel already!
--The headline in local Richmond paper: ""Gazing Balls go Missing""  (needless to say, this perked my interest
--got purposely woken up with a phone call telling me to turn on the radio to listen to the ""don't worry, be happy"" guy do a one-man-band thingy because it was thought that something that hyper would get my ass out of bed (he was right)
--took kari to dinner for her b-day, the fondue was neat...she ordered the ""super wet burrito"" but noted that it really wasn't all that wet...she made up for it though in parking lot by letting loose a super-wet-fart....seriously funny.
--Spent friday in d-town and ferndale at the java hutt doing some work and dodging the rain, there was supposed to be an ice festival but all i saw was a santa claus harassing people in front of the dollar castle
--other stuff happened but its not all that interesting or amusing in print form, so for now this is the cockblock signing off."

"event","i'm not sure if the last 24hrs. is my life because it is simply too good to be true.  I won't put the details into words because i would not be able to do them justice.  tonight i will go to bed and release a sigh of relief and fall asleep with a smile of such elation on my face that until now did not exist. i have learned so much recently and some of it has been so painful. but sitting here now it has ALL been worth it."

"event","today is my dad's birtday, he is a whopping 53 yrs young and is still rockin out like a MO-FO!!  of all his presents he seems to like the ""BEST of Foreigner"" cd my brother got him as a joke, so i guess my pj pants  and nose-hair trimmers shall come in a distant second.  we just got back from din-din at a restaurant highly recommended by irwin, and kudos!--it was scrumptuous...have you ever been ranted at by a goldfish?--i have, and it is jolly good entertainment...i also just saw ""man on fire"" on the whole ON demand thing(haven't checked out the guitar lessons yet), better than what i had expected i must say though it caused me to miss damien rice on leno last night so to erin: ""i'm sorry!i said i would tape it, but forgot!"" that's all folks, tomorrow is shopping shopping shopping as i think i will finally say adieu to the last of my stockpiled monies hidden like nuts stored for the winter.  and since i have decided against my original gift idea for kari and erin i am now at square one, but i'll think of somethin  :)"

"event","My basic recap of the holiday weekend:
Wednesday - was totally behind schedule the entire day, I was supposed to meet up with peeps later in thead y but got so behind and the weather was crap, so i ended up having to skip late nite theatrics...i had an interesting experience in my mom's office though, especially with canadian boy telling me that he was finished building our house and all we had to now was get married(this is news to me)
Thursday - helped make dinner and it was great, got sleepy and took a nap--the lions suck--nuff said
Friday - my mom actually sent me to the mall....me at the mall the day after thanksgiving, i'm proud i didnt fall to the floor in convulsions.
Saturday-Sunday -  i cant remember, lots of relaxing, sleeping, shopping, put up Christmas decorations, very nice.
Fun long weekend, not all that exciting, but way more enjoyable than any other thanksgiving weekend from recent memory.  Now it's time for Christmas, kinda crazy, eh?"

"event","Hello again,
Such a gloomy day, yet so many nice things happened.  It was off to my alma mater to collect some recommendation letters from my former profs for my PhD apps.  After getting yelled at for only applying to Wayne State and not to better schools I explained my reasoning and we decided on a compromise that left everyone happy, and left myself feeling much more confident about my plans for the next couple years.  After a lot of anxiety over this in the past few weeks believe me, I feel much better and much more confident.  

Not to beat a dead horse, but I'm still feeling the after effects of whatever stuck me in bed for two days: I feel better but looking at sandwiches makes me queasy.  I had coffee and a croissant with Erin before she headed off to Hollywood, then I made my way to Target to buy b-day gifts for my litle cousin.  I made off with over $60 in that BRATZ slut doll crap--they have a BRATZ shushi bar set!  How chic, Barbie beware!  Now I'm home for the night and I think I'm gonna go read some Milton."

"event","I typically think these things are for vacant, sorority types.  But I also know that it will keep me from being more productive with more important things and that's cool with me in general for now.  I doubt I will keep this thingy up though, but we'll see.

Saturday I went and saw the Pixies at the FOX, and good thing for its huge marquee saying ""Tonite: THE PIXIES"" cause I thought the show was at the State Theatre.  Before the show I got dinner at the WAB and ordered something different--BIG MISTAKE!--Do not order the Cashew Turkey Sandwich!!--

The show was incredible--thoroughly enjoyable, i love kim deal...all was good until i got home.  Shortly after the end of SNL I got hit with what amanda would call ""the vomitus""---and the vomitus came every hour, on  the hour, for the next 5 hours...ughghg

so sunday was spent in bed avoiding further vomitus."

Okay so here I am sitting in my room crying not even really sure why... I decided finally to stop thinking that i was gonna be able to go out with this guy I really liked... he is a friend of my friends and I met him at there house one night... he is really cool and there seem to be a lot of simialar intrest but I am not the chasing type i guess... especially since I don't see him in person and don't have a chance to talk to him  online since I doubt he even has any messengers... I have his number but i hate phones and it is hard to learn things about a person and have conversations through texts........ so i have been thinking about giving up on the idea on us going out or really doing anything because school is almost done and then I have to go home and it just seemed like a bad idea but I wasn't really thrilled at the idea of it all so I thought maybe I could have some hope and maybe something magical would happen but instead I have had two oppurtunities to hang out with him one was last night but i couldn't cause I had signed up to do this event til six in the morning... well then there was hope that he would hang out at my friends house tonight... will he showed but i took too long getting ready and talking to a few friends here and by the time that I was about to leave found out he had already left and that was it for me.... it has to be fate or something to lose out on the chance twice like this..... especially the one today... I really wont have a chance to see him again before I go home..... and even if I did there wouldn't be much of a point to it..... i would be about three hours away for three months.... I have given up on the thoughts of other crushes before but for some reason this when has got me into an emotional wreck.... which also has me questioning my sanity haha.... I dont know my head is going about a million miles an hour.... I am crushed more than i have ever been by a bf dumping me and I am just not understanding why..... oh well mike if it is meant to be it will happen when the time is right.... I should know better than to think that I really have much control in anything that happens to me.... but still I don't know right now i just hurt...... I should be over it in a couple days I just have to hope that it happens sooner then later.....  love you all ~Dee"

"event","In all my disfunctional relationships this one has lasted me the longest... but I had to finally breakup with the boy cause I was sick of being in a relationship that was already over... why hang on to a title that really doesn't mean anything to us... we hadn't really talked or barely seen each other for almost a month... so about half of the time we were supposedly going out we weren't even talking to each other and so I got fed up and said this has to end and so it has..... I am a lil upset by it but it really was the best thing to do for all parties involved I believe.... it just seems so abrupt but that is okay... I just hope I can get over the fact that he has now ruined 'just to see you smile' for me which is a song that I really have enjoyed for many years and now it has been tainted.... I hate how relationships can do that to a person... especially me haha will I am in pretty good spirits right now and hope that this will mean I can have more fun.... haha we will see I guess.... will I should go take a shower now I will ttyl always with love, ME"

I am in a weird mood and I hope that it passes quickly cause it just makes me upset.... doesnt' help that I tend to listen to songs that are sad or moody but hey they are good songs... such as James Blunt song which I have stuck in my head... and Melissa Etheridge songs which just get me all on edge.... I dont' know hopefully I will be able to be happy with things soon cause I am a happy person and not being happy is just killing me.... oh and Doom which I watched really disappointed me I thought it would be better.... well I have things to do tonight so I hope I am in a better mood next time I write...

"event","just cause I am here and I am bored... so I am going to my friends house for the night on saturday and I am super excited for this because I have yet to even go to her town and me and her always hangout so this will be a good opurtunity to meet more of her family and friends  then I already have thus far.... I have been working my ass off for my art class which is a lil ironic cause I only took that class so I could have enough credits to be a full term student... I am still having some issues about my ex... I dont' know why I can't let it go... I don't want to be with him and I we have both moved on to other people but yet it bugs me... with the way he treated me he doesn't deserve this emotional junk to be used on him but for some reason I can't help it.... I think me and my bf are going to make it to the one month aniversery this is a goal I have not yet obtained except with my ex's (meaning aniversery of our break ups haha I only count the one from my ex that is still my friend and a person that I cherish.... but we will talk about him some other time) but me and the boy seem to be going strong...  I should get going I will talk when I have something that makes more sense love always ME"

I don't know if there have been any changes on this thing since last time I was on it but it looks like there must have cause this page looks completely new to me hmmmmm maybe I will load a pic of me up on here cause I don't think I have done that yet.... so this is just one of many of these blog like things I have... I also Have myspace and facebook and a few others so this is kinda interesting to come back to the first one I had had... the one that started it all... haha ttyl ME"

I can't realize that I may know some quality straight guys until we are leaving?!  or maybe I am just thinking they were quality cause I haven't had much time to seriously evaluate them.. either way it doesn't matter cause I am not at school I am here and it is no good.. I will just bury myself in books except at work where I will boy watch as always (how could I not there are so many hotties there and from all over the place, there are even australians woowoo  yep I am a dork who loves australia!!)  Well I have all the sudden gotten bored with this and am already upset that I haven't seen much of anyone yet (tho I did get a surprise visit from two awesome friends but it would be boring to go into that and it was a short visit since my brother and father can't stand to wait if it isn't something that has to do with them)  I miss everybody and those from back home that I missed I haven't heard from yet :(  oh well I should go do something more constructive haha. I'll write soon."

I hate whining but yet I am anyway...  I am having fun why do I consume myself with thinking I need a relationship, all it would do is get in the way!!  I have awesome friends and I am meeting all kinds of new people...  I can't believe how many new people I have met just with in this last year... I have met people who I do not know how I could have gotten on with out them before bu yet I want something more but at least I am not alone a lot of my friends seem to be in the same boat.  Especially G who is having a had time finding a guy he is into that is gay.  I should just wait till I get this diet thing going then maybe I can get some to look at my (besides the creeps like the Perv.)  I dont know.  I can't believe those girls who throw away good guys..like my friend ""Hick"" his ex gf must have been crazy because he is an awesome guy.  He's attracive and sweet and a good dancer (swing, baby.)  He is such a god friend and he is so much fun to hang out with.  I will miss him when he is gone. oh I should just give up but that is not me....I say I give up but in my mind I never do.. in some recess of my brain I keep thinkin will there is a chance.  Than llama Chris tells me that I should go for this guy who has a gf (11 months!) cause he say a ""spark"" between us.  If I did that I would hate myself and I don't think I could trust the guy.  I mean really that is just a horible thing to do.  will no one reads this anyway so I will stop ranting and maybe try to get something important done.  Wow can't believe that I haven't wrote anything about stargate but I guess I'll have to do that some other time.  Always ME"

I got offered to do it but it was a guy who has a girlfriend and I wouldn't have done it anyway.. hopefully it was only cause he was drunk but I know better than that.  but that was after the good stuff.  Oh but another bad  thing is that I have to get a new mouse cause mine broke.  How sucky is that.  But for the good stuff now:    
I talked to Marc  who is the hottest guy I have ever met.  He is also gay which is awesome... of course the fact that he is so unblieveably hott.  Makes me sometimes wish I was a guy.. but anyway.
I talked to T.V.  he is soooooooooooooo cute I bet he is an adorable sleeper. I saw him before he went to bed.
Then Ishamel was nibbling on my ear and he was trying to learn how to swing dance with the help of me and his roommate who is a good swing dancer but it was hard cause it was in the hall of the dorms.  

OMG I need to get a boyfriend bad.

What else should I talk about.  I have no fricken clue.  Kudos to tim who tried to fix my computer that wasn't really broken.  but he made it faster but I need to get a new mouse.  First the keyboard goes than the mouse.  How sucky is that?!

"event","Hello all sorry that has it been so long.  I have been pretending to be busy plus I had spring break.  I have one thing to say that is really on my mind at this point in time:  I saw one of my friends msn names which said It is better to have love and lost than to have never have loved at all.  I have just realized how much I hate this phrase considering I have never loved ( well with the exception of family which I believe is suppose to be excluded in this statement and is worse if I consider those who do not love their family like I love mine).  This makes me feel like scum because I am not part of this better category.  I have lost but before I could get attached to anyone (or more specifically any guy).  Cause when I analyze me and the gay guy I fell for I think there was mostly lust in that as well as all my guy crushes that I have had in the past and even presently.  Having never been in a real relationship I feel that this comment is trying to take down all the single people who never had a chance3 for love since in my case I am seen as the friend not the girlfriend.  This has got to be yet worse for my gay friend who has to find a guy he likes and then find out if the guy is gay or straight  (or even bi as a case may be).  Am I always going to be helpless I wonder?  
             Oh my hick friend want me to say something about him and I only call him a hick because that is what he asked me to refer to him as.  He is an awesome guy and a good dancer (swing dancer not something liike napolean Dynamite would do).  Anyway there now he'll be appreciative he got mentioned.  Too bad it is in this entry but who really gives a damn.  Oh speaking of dams  we have a picture drawn by mr ADD on our door of a beaver and it says watchout for mr. beaver.  It is funny and cute.
             What is with all the guys who like blondes by the way??  Two really hott guys are wasating their time falling for only blondes.  WHat is the point of that seriously??! So I am not blonde and I will not dye my hair blonde either.  I should go drown myself in a puddle now.  I am not sure weather or not it is still raining hmmmmmmmmmmmm whatever."

(keeping it down for the kiddies that may happen upon this)...anyway who wants to go on abouit her......not me right now since she hasn't pissed me off lately and by my saying that means we haven't talked in awhile.......I didn't intend to make my journal so negative as I am a generally positive person.....oh well got to let it out some where so I am going to hit the keys.....I type more on here than I do in my essays but I guess it is because I don't feel the need for structure here....I should go though....till next time!"

Or maybe it has to do with my recent absence of caffine from pop which I have given up in the hopes that I will lose some weight since I can't go n the akeins diet when I am eating cafeteria food.  I am applying to be an RA and I am nervous about that and the fat that my back still hurts and doesn't show signs of going away.  Things is I'll have to wait till the summer to get it checked out.  Why is it that most the guys I like are gay and the others think of me as a buddy.  I really think I am just one of the guys but the problem is that I like the guys.......I want the guys.If I was a gay male I would be in heaven but right now I am a single heterosexual female....... becoming a lesbian it looks like my chances are still low.   Hey if my roomie got drunk she may make out with me oh lucky joy for me right. I feel like my best friend ditched me....though that isn't what happen it still feels like that.. wow my radio just turned really loud which is scary and it is playing she don't know she's beautiful ... a song I love though it doesn't really apply to me oh shit my radio just turned off.....I am so scared now.....I was gonna go to bed but my hair is still wet from my shower.

I got to see my nephew though since one of his great grandmas on his fathers side died.  I had meet her a few times and she was a spunky old lady.  My sisterseemed a little worried about the whole ordeal which seems warrented since they didn't get there luggage back yet and her jacket and the little ones jacket were in there.  I hope they get it all back soon.  I can not wait to go see them over spring break.  I have to work tomorrow but I do not feel that I am completely over whatever I have.  Oh well I guess that will just have to do.  I wish I could go to the club I miss seeing him.  I know that I don't really have a chance with him but there is something about him that I just can't stand not seeing him less than weekly I wish I could see him daily. He is like a mystery that I just have to figure out and if I don't he'll drive me insane forever.  Oh nothing sppectacular happened at the island that night I l lost the 10 bucks I gambled but my nephew was adorable.  I got him to say the island is calling then he asked me who was it caling.  I thought that was so cute and that was all in the car on the way to the buffet.  Well anyway we h ad been in the resturaunt for about half an hour at least and he trys to get my attention and when he does he tells me ""look at all the other people the island has called"" and he begings to point out all the places the people are in the resturant.  Oh I love that little boy so much.  I wish that he lived closer to me but oh well.  My sister said that if she had known sooner that I had so much time between semesters she would have had me go back with them and sent me back to school on a plane.  Oh well more time with my mum who I think needs me more than my sister does."

He refused to go into my dorm room.  It may have been because of my roommate.  She has her eyebrow pierced and he is young so it may have scared him.

"event","I took this from my brother who took it from someone else:

""Is there a point to life when your passion no longer wants you? Where do you go when the world gets blurry with tears? What next when you wipe the tears away and everything is still a blur? When do you just admit that if you can't make yourself care about the things you want to care about that you'd be better off with an empty skull. Can mistakes be washed away with pain? Can love be shared outward if it cannot be granted inward? Can i live again after dying once? If all i cause is pain will i ever see happiness? Will words ever mean anything? Will the lump in my throat ever go away? Will my questions ever be answered?'

...
I used to think that no, because you don't know what you're missing so it can't be that painful. That it'd be worse to love someone and loose them. Now I think differently. I want to know what it is like to be in love. Broken hearts hurt, but hearts that have never experienced love also hurt. What is the purpose of a heart? Not in a medical way, when people think heart they think love, and my heart isn't working, I haven't found love. Its not like I expect to find my soulmate at age 18, but you know what I mean... I long to know what its like to have someone care about you, to want to kiss you and hug you and be with you always. I want to know what its like to want to do anything for someone, I want to know what its like to have that. It seems like so many people just go from boyfriend to boyfriend, girlfriend to girlfriend, or just guy to guy and girl to girl. How do they do that? What's their secret? How is it so easy for them? I rarely even have crushes on people, because in the past things have never worked out, so I tell myself from the begining hey don't! And I don't develop a crush on them, maybe that's why I don't like anyone anymore, I won't let myself. It not a good feeling to like someone then hear stories about who they like or who they kissed or have them ignore you. It makes me sit there and think what's wrong with me? What is it about me that makes no guys want to be with me? And as I always say you can't help like who you like. They don't like me that way and its never going to change but I just wonder when I am going to find someone I like and they like me back... when is it ever going to work out for me? It sounds like I'm just complaining and whining if you think that I don't care. I was just sitting here and thinking okay so I find it a little pathetic that I'm 18 and never had a true boyfriend (true meaning not a middle school one that pretty much meant hey we're friends that like eachother but did nothing about that.) I've never been on a date, I've never kissed anyone, I guess I just find it sad. And I know that maybe other people my age haven't experienced those things either, but being a hopeless romantic I can't ever forget it and its always on my mind, driving me insane. I just don't know anymore..."

I watched Girl Next Door in the basement and I think I made my gay guy friend upset with me but he tells me not to worry about it that he still likes to hang with me.  Anyway I have alot of classes with him next semester.  But I forgot to tell you about SG.  So were on our way again after we returned to the dorms because this one chick forgot her drivers license (she though her school id would work, it doesn't.)  So we all talk to her boyfriend who's on her cell a little bit but then the driver is talking to him (one of my best guy friends ever) he starts talking to him.  The boyfriend said something to him like hi hows it goin?  and he replies oh not to bad just driven to the club and the girl hit his chair because her boyfriend was not suppose to know (wouldn't approve, guys get so jealous for no reason) So his little fixer up was ""oh s**t I mean the library.""  Everyone was laughing so hard except the boyfriend and maybe the girl.  I was to busy laughing to notice.  Oh and some guy grabbed me and danced with my behind for a little bit but lucky it was only for like a sec.  I still regret not asking that guy to dance.  Oh well I guess thats too bad.

I was waiting for my friend B (female) from dorm next door on the fourth floor of my dorm which is an all boy floor (I live on the all girl floor below the only one in that building think about this 3 guy floors and one girl floor usually I would think lucky me but it isn't really all I thought it would be but back to the real story).  So I ma waiting with my friend N (also female from B's dorm) for B to get back from ironing one of my guy friends Chris's shirt (I know all eight of the guys at the end of the hall (last 2 rooms on each side).  We were outside my crushes room who lives with a friend chuck (they are two of the eight guys).  Well he gets back form a fraternity meeting that went really late.  He is talking to me and N about the meeting and starts unbuttoning his shirt.  Then N goes (two buttons into the process and makes a comment on his nice shirt and he goes in his room to unbutton the rest and switch it with a t-shirt.  The door is still open and he is talking to N and when he's almost finished he sees me watching him and he asked me if I was watching him.  N starts laughing I move back to original postion to stuned to even think he then says ""busted"" and know I am also laughing with N.  It made me hyper for the rest of the night.  I hope he doesn't get completely digusted with me because I dtill want him as friend if he doesn't want to be anything more.  He is so smart and cool but whatev.  That is my story hope you get a laugh if not I got enough from it."

"event","Hey this is me.  I am so excited that it is thanksgiving and that I can come home to see my family.  I love pumpkin pie but I am going to try and eat reasonable.  I have a lot of home work to do but I am procastinating by making myself busy online.  I have to work tomorrow and I am not to excited about that.  I would rather stay home and visit my family but I need to make some money so that I can continue to go to school.  I also hope that I'll be able to go to Australia with the study abroad program but that would mean I have to take a lot of credits.  I would rather stay in school for 8 more years then get a job and come to terms with the real world.  I am glad that I have at least 3 years of college left and maybe more with grad school.  I don't want to do what Van Wilder did but he had a good philosphy I think.  I have to write this paper and it is on how my roommate and her cell phone are a like.  Hopefully I well be able to get through that without to many entanglements.  Oh by the way I love the sea (ocean) but esppecially Sea turtles.  I have only seen one while I was scuba diving in Couzmel it was awesome.  My brother loves tigers.  I think they are cool too but he wouldn't be happy if I was all the sudden collecting them."

"event","<p>hey all! My roommate and I are trying to find someone to sub-lease our apartment from mid-may to the end of july. We're both moving somewhere else (not together) and do not need to be wasting our money here over the summer, but can't get out of our lease without sub-leasing. The apartment is a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment located on Buffington Ave. in the Buffington Arms Apartment building (#12) owned by Big Green. The rent is $575 a month, which breaks down to $287.50 each for 2 people. The utilities aren't that bad, you'd have to pay water, electricity, and for cable if you want it. It is unfurnished but comes with a small table and 2 chairs. If you and a roommate sublease in May, my roommate will throw in her couch for free! You would start paying rent in June, but would have to pay a security deposit of the same amount that rent is to my roommate and I, and you would then receive our security deposit that we originally paid when you move out. If you're looking to stay in Huntington over the summer and then live here for the upcoming school year this is a perfect time to catch a good apartment! If you're interested email me at Gilbert26@marshall.edu<br /><br />Thanks!!<br />~ashley</p>"

"event","Hey guys.. i just found out that my grandfather has a cancerous tumor in the top right part of his head...they can't operate..if they did they could only take half of it out, but it might kill him, and the drs. said chemo wouldn't help it at all... He's on steroids which will stop the swelling and make him act normal-ish, but as soon as it gets to the left side of his head he won't remember any of us... 

If you pray, please remember my grandfather, grandmother, and my family in your prayers. I'd really appreciate it..Thanks

"event","I'm bored at work on my break.. So i decided that it's time to update the good ole' livejournal.. not like i update anything though, really. 

So, my summer hasn't gone to bad.. Working 40 hours a week since May 30th.. I haven't gone to the pool or anything though, which sucks, because I'm still white as a cloud.. But I leave for the beach sunday! Its gonna be awesome :), but anyways, my job is absolutley boring, but for 6.10 an hour, I don't really care. Like, seriously, the hardest thing about my job is staying awake. I sit here and scan old titles into the computer..that's it. The state pays me for that! yayness. But it's all good, i guess. It's been great to be able to see my sister everyday. I hardly get to see her at all during the school year, and that's way hard on me. It's gonna be especially hard this year because I'm going to miss seeing her pregnant and everything. :'( 
So yeah, I leave for the beach sunday morning..early sunday morning..I'll be back the next saturday.. then I move into my apt. the next week. Then the next week is Nitro's band camp, in which I'm instructing again (for more money this year! yay me!), and then my band camp at Marshall is the next week, and school starts after that.. What a fun month August will be! ..Busy-ness..Stress...yay. blah.

I really can't wait to move into my apartment. Finally my own place, where i can make the rules and my parents have no control over anything anymore. their lack of brains kills me sometimes.. I love them to death, but they go overboard sometimes... And of course I'm way way WAY glad to be able to cook my own food.. a year of that dorm food was about to kill me. And now i can bake! yay! haha.. Yeah, so break is almost over and i'm too bored for livejournal now.... it way sucks that the state blocks myspace and facebook from us...

I'm droping my Communications/speech class because i just can't do it right now.. I'm over stressed and i'm really deprived of sleep. yeah.. fun life od a college student/music major. yay.

BTW: You all looked amazing in the pics i saw of formal. I'm way depressed i couldn't go :'( . I WILL be at prom :)

I've almost got my clarinet paid for. $425 more... it has a crack in it. damn wood. my instructor thinks its only a hairline and she temporarily fixed it. Kerr's is going to be my savior this summer.I'm going to have it entirely fixed. Cork, pads, everything. It needs it. rawr. damn money stealing buffett.

So. I'm a member of Kappa Kappa Psi. And right now things aren't to busy with it. Convention is coming up though, and we're hosting it in charleston. so that should be fun.
I'm joining MENC... which is the Music Educator's National Conference. Not really sure what to expect out of it... but It'll look pretty good on a resume, so i'll stick with it.
I recently got a bid for Delta Omicron as well. It's the music educator's fratunaty. It should be fun. and it too will look good on a resume.

Busy busy busy... yippee..

But anyways, brandon is on his way up here to see me and everything, so i'm off! love and MISS you all!!! <3

-get a handle on my shopping crazy.. less spending money would be GRAND
-SAVE money
-force myself to practice more.. and better
-study rather than be lazy and hang out with people when i know i have other things that must be done
-get an A in theory
-refrain from as much stress as possible
-get more sleep on school nights (rather than be on the internet/phone till 3 in the morning) (*this one will be broken, i'm sure*)
-actually do my [own] homework
-actually work hard on [my own] homework
-stop biting my nails when i'm nervous/stressed out

"event","i feel so lost in my own mind sometimes. weird? yeah, probably. but anyways..

Christmas wasn't all that grand this year, nothing new. It's not as big of a deal in my family as i wish it would be.. which makes me so eager to get out on my own and have a family of my own where i can make it a huge deal. blah.
My parents didn't even care to get me anything real.. contacts.. which i did need, but shouldn't have been a present. And a crappy p.o.s. digi camera that hasn't much use for anything. ..and that's it. No candy in the stocking. nothing. I went and bought $12 in candy at the dollar store just so my sister and brother-in-law would have candy in their stocking because i wasn't about to leave it empty. I hate how selfish my parents are. ""we don't have the money to fill our kid's stockings.. but lets go bowling 3 nights a week!!!"" ..blah. I don't even care about the presents really... i just wish they'd care about more than themselves.

Brandon got me the most beautiful necklace ever :) he's the greatest guy i could ever ask for.. I'd be so lost without him. He also got me the rent soundtrack, which makes me way happy, lol
His parents got me a way awesome pair of boots
And his grandma got me a $25 gift card to fashion bug
My sister and kenny got me a dolphin sno globe thingy, a beta fish that i named Squirt, and paid for my hair to be cut :)
My grandparents/aunt/uncle/etc.. got me
about 3 different skirts
4-5 shirts
2 pair of comfy/lazy pants
a marshall hoodie
$20
make up
a fleece blanket
a pink heartshaped pillow that has a little vibrating box in it
a makeup bag with clinique makeup in it
my uncle otto from indiana sent me a cute little box with a buterfly on it and a note and gold-coin dollar (inside joke with he and my sister and i)

and i cant remember anything else...

Brandon went to dinner with me at my grandma's sunday evening. I'm way glad my family likes him :) ..he about killed me though because they bought stuff for him, lol. That's alright though.
After dinner i went to my sister's and didn't get home till 8somethin tonight because of a change of plans.. i was suppose to come home last night. but that didn't happen... yeah..

Tomorrow is brandon's birthday! He'll be 18, god help us all. So we're hangin out, watching some movies and such.. Friday he's having a LAN party.. so i'm not even invited, lol. Not that i'm complaining. I'm gonna go hang out with witt and fluffy, so it's all good :) and hopefully saturday i'm going to fluffy's party, but i'm not sure if the rents will let me out... we'll see how that works out.

So yeah.. i'm home till the 8th, so someone call me and hang out!

Ha, that's way more than I was expecting, and i'm WAY not complaining! haha. I don't remember working that many hours.. Plus, my aunt sent me a card with $10, so i'm all in the money today, lol. To bad i have to save most of it.. blah.

Anyways, life lately has been pretty awesome. I came home last tuesday night, after a brutal final and working 4 hours. Wednesday I ended up sleeping a good deal and eventually going to the mall and church with brandon. Thursday I slept till 12:30 and it was great awesomeness. I forget what else i did though, lol. Friday i didn't do much.. went to my sister's awards dinner at State. Saturday i did nothing and went to the bowling ally. Mike gave me a way pretty gold cross necklace for christmas! :)He's a way great friend/brother. Yesterday was Amber's graduation! She's finally out of college! haha. I'm so proud of her. After 5.5 years and 2 majors she's teaching! She's subbing today, actually. After her graduation we went to dinner. Then I came home and went to brandon's house. His mom got a new puppy! it's so cute too! He ended up getting way mad that Mike got me a cross necklace and made me open his christmas present.. i had told brandon last month that i wanted a cross necklace for christmas... and when i was in for thanksgiving mike asked me what brandon was going to get me.. and i told him probably a cross necklace.. but he didn't remember that or something.. but brandon got me this beautiful 14k white gold cross necklace. it's so freakin beautiful. i love it. I hate that he got so mad though.. it wasn't a happy opening :( but it's okay. I'm going over to his house after he gets out of school today to play with the puppy and help him on a paper for english, and of course just to spend time together. I way love that kid. :) I can't even believe that i once almost thought otherwise, i'm way glad i came to my senses! 

So anyways... I'll be at school thursday, providing that Spencer is still going and is still going to take me. So i'll definitly be in the band room during 4th block to see people! I miss ya'll so much, you have NO idea how alone i usually feel at marshall. 

But anyways.. my time being bored is over, i need to find something to do. bye!!

If subway were to burn down this very second, i would not give a damn. In fact, I'd point and laugh.

If i didn't need the money so much, i'd quit. damn parents and their lack of helping me with anything.

"event","Yeah, it most definatly has been a long while. Life has been okay. A bit stressful, definatly busy, but still okay. Nothin to horrible, anyways. I like it here at marshall.. yet at the same time, i hate it. I really feel kind of alone here sometimes... I miss brandon and everyone... granted i do have a lot of new great friends here, i really really miss all ya'll. 

The music department owns my soul... it's official. I'm taking 17 hours next semester.. with 11 classes (i have 15 hours this sem. with 10 classes.). It's insane. My schedule is hell. And with work on top of that.. i'm doomed. 

BUT.. the great news is: I got my clarinet!!! That's right. I'm now the proud owner of a Buffett R-13 professional Bflat clarinet! And damn, am I happy about it... Now i just have to get it paid for, lol. I'm buying it from a girl who was a music major here but she won't be next semester and she's selling it to get a lesser value one, because she doesn't need a great buffett now. So she's selling it to me for $1200 ..i'll pay $200 a month and have it paid off in 6 months! I'm way excited, you don't even know! lol. It's beautiful too, and it sounds awesome as well. But yeah, It's all mine now :)

So.. do me a favor and leave me lots of love, because i need it.

Love and Miss ya'll!!

"event","So, i haven't updated in a while... Not to much has happened. I've got some awesome friends up here. I've got no time for anything, including sleep. I work more then i need/want to, and I never have time for homework! Interesting life of a college student, yay. 

So Marshall won today! YaY! ..went into overtime, ended up winning 16-13. yay herd! 
Who's got a herd on???

I got my hair cut yesterday. It looks okay. The lady did the exact oposite of what i asked for. I told her not above a certain point, and she put it just above that point. I told her no layers, it's in 2 now. And she barley angled it in the front like i wanted. People say it looks okay though, so I'll go with their opinion.

I never get to talk to brandon... It kills me. I miss him SO freakin' much. I really hope he comes to Marshall next year. I don't care if he ends up majoring in something that will keep us poor.. i just want him to be here and around me all the time. I miss him to much. Everytime I call he's to busy, or I just don't have time to call. And he always calls me when i'm to busy to talk. It sucks major booty. I really hate this situation...


Band at MU sucks ass. It's way to easy. I'm starting to hate it a whole lot. I don't like my section either. You guys know.. I come from a woodwind section that is -like- teh closest section in the band.. here, i barley know everyone's name, and there's only like.. 13 clarinets... half of them barley talk to anyone but their own clique. There's no closeness at all. I'm contemplating learning a new instrument just to join a new section. I don't like the music or drill we do. Not a bit of it is challanging. I miss the drum corps. style of nitro.... I miss nitro in general actually.... blah.

....sorry to rant and bore you.. i have to work tomorrow though.. so i'm goin to bed soon. Bye!

"event","So, this week has been pretty cool. Monday Nick gave me one of his computers that he wasn't using so that i could have one in my room. He's definitely the greatest brother ever :) After he brought the computer up we went to walmart and then we made dinner at his appartment and he and his roommate and i ate. Just hung around. Had some fun.
Tuesday was an okay day.. I had to work from 5-close (around 12:30 last night!) so today I am DEAD TIRED. I didn't get home till around 12:45.. then i worked on a paper till 1:15ish, got to bed around 1:30, and then i couldn't get to sleep for like.. EVER. And had to wake up at 6:20 for class... damn 8:00 classes. Rawr. 
Today wasn't to bad. Besides being tired all day. It seemed like everything would never end. I'm glad it has though.. even if i do have homework to do later. I'm going to TRY to go to bed early.. doubt that'll happen though... I have math, english, and aural skills to do work for.. yay... tomorrow i work 5-close again.. god help me. I won't have allen there.. so it won't be as okay.. blah. I get paid tomorrow though, so i'm going to be okay. I'll be able to get some things i need now. finally. yeah.

So, it looks like I'll be going home on the 16th! ..I'm going to go to the Spring Valley vs. Nitro (at SV) game on the 16th, then come home, stay the night at my house, and on the 17th i'm going to the Cabel Midland festival with the band. Then that night, brandon is staying up here with me for the rest of the weekend. I really miss him.. more than i thought i would. Like.. i haven't been so sure of everything the past couple weeks, but certain events have made me really notice how much I love brandon with all my heart, and how much i care about him. I really REALLY miss that kid. gosh.. (no shane, i don't miss attitude or halo, lol)

Yeah, but anyways, i'm gonna go watch the notebook and attempt my math now.... ta ta!

"event","Hey everyone! What's going on? Nothing really here. I'm chillin in the computer lab that is FINALLY open after about 2 weeks of being closed. I've been so deprived! LoL. Yeah. But anyways, the second week of school has been going pretty well. Nothing to extreme. Monday was hecktic.. 6 classes in one day, duh, of course it was. And after my last class, ending at 9pm, I had to write a paper.. so i was out late doing that. Tuesday was okay. It was my first day working at Subway. It wasn't all to horrible. Yeah, that's right, I have a job. Lol, scary, i know, but it's okay. It isnt hard at all. Especially with the people that work that shift with me. My fried Allen works with me, so it's not bad at all! Yesterday was okay too. The band got to practice in the stadium, on the nice new astroturf. It's so much better than the old! Nitro band, you'll love it at the festival! lol. Today has been pretty good. Game tonight. Should be interesting... yeah, we'll see. 

I've been in college for 2 weeks now and already i have SOO much i need to buy. Damn me and my major. I have to buy a new clarinet, because mine isn't a professional one, so yeah, that'll put me about $1000 or more in the hole. Before I get that I need to buy a new mouthpiece.. that'll be about $80 or more. And i need to buy some new reeds.. On top of that, i still don't have all of my books. I needs some random odds and ends, and i still need to buy a comforter and matress pad for my bed! Rawr! ..Hopefully my loan refundwill come in soon and i can get some stuff with that (it's about $1100!) I figure if i can save half or most of the loan money and keep adding half or some of my paycheck in, I can get that clarinet in about.. 5 or 6 months. LoL. Yeah. Hopefully my parents will help some. Hopefully. ...they haven't helped a whole lot yet, so we'll see....

I really miss brandon. Like, a whole lot. But hopefully I'll get to see him soon. He may come down here on the 16th and 17th. Hopefully I won't have to work! 

Anyways, I'm gonna get off of here and go do some stuff before the game. I hope thoes of you who are still in high school had a great first week!!!

We watched Without A Paddle, National Treasure, and Harry Potter 1. We also attempted to make ""Ton-Tounge Toffee"" from harry potter movies. got the recipe off of Mugglenet.com ..i didnt like it to much, but it was okay, lol. We stayed up till after 2 am watching thoes movies, lol. Then woke up around 7, 7:30 and i went home, took a shower and got ready to go again! lol. Justin picked me up around 10:15 and we went to nitro to cats back records to sell them some used CDs but they weren't open till 11 so we just went to Marshall. Fun times driving up there, crashing a million times, yup. lol. !insider! We walked around campus a bit.. mainly doin nothing, lol. Then we met his boyfriend and went to his appartment. Awesome hang out times. Went to eat at Arbys, then we left and went to find toys r us!! lol.. that was an event. just finding the place was an event, lol. I met a friend of mine there who i've been talking to online (matt). He's pretty cool. cool indeed. definitely friend material, lol. He's in the band at marshall, so yeah. i need friends down there, lol. So after talkin to him for about 15 mintues justin and i went to circut city, then home! My brother in law picked me up a couple hours later.. So now i'm at my sister's house just hangin around bein way bored, but yeah, that was my day! exciting?? Fun?? I think so!

So anyways, tomorrow i'm going to go see a movie and whatever else with amber and kenny, then goin home, packing, and all that lovelyness.. and saturday i might be helping my uncle with a wedding again, hopefully. I need the money.. Sunday leaving for nitro's band camp.. Coming home from that on the 13th. Going to my band camp on the 14th, and then i'm gonna be in huntington for a way long time. Happy times? I'm thinking not. Im really going to miss brandon.. even though he doesn't understand why. He's looking at this whole college thing in a way different perspective than i am. He sees it as he'll see me again soon. I'm seeing it as i won't be seeing him everyday like i'm use to and i wont be talking to him as much.... he doesn't understand at all how i'm feeling about it, but i guess i can't do anything about it, huh? yeah,well.. i'm gonna go now. Thanks for reading my boredom! adios

Go there, if you have .mp3 files or other music files on your computer, You can have them sent straight to your phone, for free! Free ringtones!! You can also send pictures to your phone!

I went to the doctor monday. Nothing really happened. They're gonna try to schedule a gall bladder ultra sound for sometime this week, if they can't do it this week, i'll have to try to see what's going on up at marshall. 

So.. tomorrow i'm staying the night with Melissa!
Thursday I'm going to Huntington with Justin and we're gonna walk around campus. I'm gonna try to go see how big my dorm room will be, and see how big closet space and everything is.

"event","Well, it's been quite an eventful week or two. Last week I was at Myrtle Beach at the Apache campground with brandon and his parents. It was way awesome fun. I love the ocean! I got burnt really bad monday though. I was reading HP6 laying on my stomach and didn't feel like holding it over my face/laying on my back, so i never turned over and yeah.. burnt bad. lol. Yeah, that's a true Harry Potter fan! Haha
So, anyways, i got sick on friday night.. so the ride home saturday was hell.. damn bumpy turnpike. rawr. I didn't do much after i had got home. My chest was hurting and i was still kinda sick. So i just layed around. Went to bed early. Woke up around 10ish sunday and layed around again. Around 6ish i took a shower and we mom and dad decided to FINALLY take me to the hospital about my chest. It's been hurting for nearly 2 months or more. So yeah, That was interesting. They did an EKG on me, took blood, gave me a pain shot in my hip, did a chest x-ray, and some other stuff. They couldn't really tell what was wrong with me. They've crossed out the possibility of heart problems, so the dr is thinking it's a gallbladder problem. He gave me 4 different perscriptions.. 3 pain (hydrocodine, ibprofine, and something else) and Pepcid for stomach acid. I need to do a followup appointment with another doctor to have a gallbaldder ultrasound. Not sure when that'll happen. But yeah, fun times? i think not.

So, School is in less than a month. After financial aid pays, i still owe $551. I have NO clue how it's going to get paid. I am so over stressed about it. Loans are practically impossible due to parent's bad credit. My grandma won't even co-sign for a loan that she'd never have to pay for, and it's all hell. It sucks ass. Hopefully god will bless me with some kind of way to pay for it.

Hopefully I'll get a roommate I like. Hopefully. I don't have a high tollerance for people so yeah... I guess if i don't like her i can just live my life in Smith Music Hall practicing like crazy, huh? yeah. I'm kinda reluctant to go into a dorm with someone i don't know... I mean, I'm gonna have a whole lot of expensive stuff in that room (my clarinet, flute, guitar, jewelry, etc..), and I don't know this person i'll be rooming with. I can't just trust someone so easily like that. I have trust issues.. i know.. but with what i've been through, i can't help it. I don't even know who it is yet.. so hopefully when i talk to/meet her we'll get along well. It'd be way awesome if she turned out to be a band chick.. then it'd be a little easier to trust her... because band people definitely rock hard.

Anyways.. enough about that. I need more money. lol. I don't have enough financial aid to pay for my first semester.. I'm abotu $300 short.. and i don't have any money period. Band camp will cost me $50. And i'm PRAYING that Mr. Brooks will let me do band camp and/or summer band. I hope i hope i hope. I need that money from it. I wish i had time for a job.. I mean, i probably do... but i doubt any place would hire me and let me off all the time i need off... the rest of my summer inclueds:

June 27-July 1st: i'm going to a day camp at WVSU from 9-2 ..they'll pay me $100 if i go every day.. with that money, i'll either use to fix my clarinet, or use for the beach..
July 2nd-4thish: possibly staying at the grandparent's.. depending on my grandpa's health. It's not lookin to good right now though :(
July 17-23rd: Beach with brandon and his parents
Aug. 7-13: Hopefully working Nitro's Band Camp.. hopefully with woodwinds.
Aug 14-19: MU Band Camp
Aug 22nd: MU Classes start

So i have a coule weeks i could work like crazy.. but honestly, what place will hire me and give me all of that time off? AND.. how am i suppose to get to work? Ah, it sucks not being able to drive and having no money. My dad expects me to help pay for whatever the Jeep needs.. yet i can't work. Yeah.. that'll work somehow. only not. That jeep is gonna sit right where it is for a LONG time. 

So.. does anyone know of anything i could do where i can have all of that time off? lol. Any odd jobs or anything? because i really need money like crazy. I can't even get a loan.. my parent's credit sucks like crazy. raw.. You guys can send me money if you want!! lol.. kidding, of course. :)

I doubt anyone even reads this, so i'm gonna go now. I won't waste my time... 
If you have read this, i love you :)

So it's been an okay two weeks. I worked with my Aunt Cindy at Merle Norman Cosmetics in the Nitro Market place Thursday through Saturday. Got paid $138 just for three days, 24 hours total.. i was pretty happy, lol. Sunday was full of nothingness. Monday, too, was nothing. I worked again Tuesday but not for money.. just to help my aunt because i love her tons and i love spending time with her. Yesterday I went to the movies with Brandon. We saw Batman Begins. It was actually a really good movie! I liked it anyways, lol. After the movie we left and about 5 minutes later his mom called my phone saying someone had found brandon's phone at the theater.. so they took it to the office and we had to turn around and go get it. So then we went to McDonalds.. i'm so sick of that place.. I paid for the movie and lunch. I felt special, lol. He actually let me, so it was quite an amazing day. lol. Last night I went to my grandparent's house and visited them a bit while dad cut their grass. So yeah.. fun week, lol. Tomorrow I'm going to the DMV to get an ID (not a learners :'( )..I have to have a pic ID for orientation next wednesday, so yeah.. doing that, then going to get my check cashed, then going to the hotel with my dad.. he doesn't have to work till 10:30.. Brandon is gonna meet us there around then or a bit later and we're going to lunch, then wherever else. I'm spending the night at his house *or up at his grandma's* and waking up WAY early and going to King's Island on saturday! Yup! fun times! :) :) :) ..It's gonna be me, Brandon, his mom Renee, his brother Jared, and Jared's Girlfriend (and Max's sister!!) Jessie. Five people in one car.. god help us. Yeah. It should be a fun day though. I'm looking forward to it!

So.. As i said, i have orientation on wednesday! from 8am to 4 pm! ..i don't think college is worth that. lol. I'm not exactly sure what will go on, but hopefully it will go well! I don't know anyone that will be there the same day, so hopefully I'll make some new friends as well. I need friends at marshall. I know hardly anyone! ..I'll make tons of band geek friends though, i'm sure. lol. 300 people in one band.. i'm sure to make tons of friends! ..I want to go back to high school though, lol. I'm gonna miss nitro band :'( But i'll get to see some of you at the Spring Valley festival as well as the Marshall festival, so yeah. lol. I'm going to beg Mr. Barnett to let me be the nitro band guide... hopefully he'll be nice like that, lol. 
I'm going to quit boring you people now. Bye!

"event","So.. I'm pretty bored.. and have nothing better to do right now.. so i decided to update! Amazing, isn't it? lol. yeah. Not that many people actually read or pay attention, but that's okay, lol. 
Where to start.. um.. how about graduation? Better yet.. After graduation, lol. Almost everyone on here was at graduation so i don't need to tell you about it. Except that it was really sad and i already miss everyone like crazy. But anyways, after graduation we took my grandma home, visited with my grandpa a little, and then came home. About an hour later we went to Brandon's because his parents invited my parents and I to their cookout. So yeah.. That was fun. My parents left after about an hour or two, so i was there without them.. which is better. lol. Brandon's family gave me $50 total and a grad. teddy bear and a book! i liked it :) ..the whole day was really cool. A day i'll always remember anyways.
The next day.. i don't really remember, lol. Monday was way over boring.. I was suppose to go to the movies with Melissa, and i was totally looking forward to it, but my dad was undecided about if we were going to do a cook out for my grandparents or not, and he didn't decide till it was to late to go to the movies. So that was a waste of a day. :( It pissed me off, honestly. Rawr. But anyways..
Tuesday Amber picked me up around 9something and we went to walmart and took brandon Lunch. Then we ate lunch at Roadrunners (best salads and ice tea ever!). After that we just drove around a bit, went to the dollar store. I bought tons of stuff that will be awesome for college, lol. I got a thing to hang my shoes up.. lord knows i have to many pairs of shoes..well, flip-flops anyways, lol. I also got things to keep me organized. After that we went back to her house. That night i was forced to go to the bowling ally with them while they bowled. So I talked to Mini-Mike on yahoo im through my phone, lol, then he called. so i talked to him a while. Then went home.. home being amber's house in the boonies of Clendennin.
Wednesday was baking day.. as was thursday, lol. I baked and decorated 2 cakes. and decorated 2 others for amber's grandma-in-law. Friday i helped out at a cake auction fund raiser for this lady and her hospital bills. ..i officially hate taking food orders and making hot dogs, lol. Saturday was pretty boring.. i don't really remember what all happened, lol. Sunday I went to church, came home, peeled and cut 10 lbs of potatoes, took a nap, then went to a dinner at the church. Twas fun. Monday Amber and I went the townish part of Clendenin. She had to do some laundry at the laundry mat because their dryer broke. While her clothing was drying we went to this little junk store. I bought 3 old NES games, lol. I had to.. haha.. they were only $2 each, so yeah. lol. After we finished there, we went to Charleston. Amber had to get her allergy shot.. then we ate at Fazoli's and then went to my house! She washed/dryed some more clothes. And then left. 
Tuesday I baked two pineapple upside downcakes. Then brandon picked me up after school and we went back to his house where we watched Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. It was the only one i hadn't seen so far. Then we went to see Star Wars Episode III. ..for the 2nd time :/ .. then we ate and i came home. So yeah.. interesting summer so far, right? lol. not really. 

Either tomorrow or friday, i'm gonna start working with my Aunt Cindy at merle norman cosmetics.. only for a week while my cousin is on vacation.. it's still money in my pocket though, so i'm not really complaining. then on the 18th i'm going to kings island with brandon, his mom, his brother, and possibly his brother's girlfriend or a friend of his. Melissa might be spending the night with me on the 19th, and then on the 20th we're gonna go hang out with our way over awesome friend Justin. The 22nd is my freshman orientation.. i'm scared! lol. I don't really know what to expect..

Anyways, i'm done boring the crap out of you, so i'm off now. 
I love you all! 
adios!

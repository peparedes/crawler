"event","""Have You Forgotten""
by Darryl Worley

I hear people saying we don't need this war
I say there's some things worth fighting for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
Before you start preaching
Let me ask you this my friend

Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away?
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

They took all the footage off my T.V.
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away?
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And we vowed to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten all the people killed?
Yes, some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon?
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?"

French people suck

Those beret-headed nuts. 
They can stick the Eifell Tower 
Straight up their butts.

Played a tune on my Uzi 
And made the sissies dance. 
Killed a hundred or more 
And I had a ball.

Many of the people I know that have Democratic beliefs hate everything about
President Bush. They hate his accent, his methods of speaking, his role in
deciding to go to war with Iraq, the No Child Left Behind program, and his
hair. The list could go on forever. Put yourself in his place. Yes, I know,
he is a grown man and is out of school, but bear with me. You are in a
position of high power of one of the most powerful countries in the world.
You are commander in chief of the military forces. You can say when to use
the supply of nuclear weapons. If even 1% of the nuclear weapons in the
world were used, all life on earth would eventually cease to exist (this I
learned from one of my past teachers). There is a country who we think has
certain weapons of mass destruction. If they do, they would change life as
we know it. Of course, the only logical thing to do in order to preserve
human life is to go in and make sure everything is safe. It was, but you
can't just leave. A surgeon can't cut someone open, do what needs to be
done, and then send the person off to live their life. They need to stitch
them up, do physical therapy, take off bandages, or do even more surgery.
People tell us to get out of Iraq now. Okay, ""ill wake you up from surgery
without any stitches. Lovely. Weapons of Mass destruction ARE our business,
when it can negatively affect the whole world, it is. To quote your article,
""What we really need to do is pull ourselves out of other countries'
business."" Sure, your life threatening disease is none of my business, no
surgery. Have a glorious day. 

Our soldiers joined military forces knowing that they may have to risk their
lives. You don't join the military because you think it will be a fun
vacation. Rather than complaining about our soldiers dying, can't we honor
those who died and thank those that are still living and fight every day for
us? If you ""love living here,"" act like it. There was no draft. Citizens
were not forced to fight. They did this because they love and care about
their country. They care about YOU, someone they have never met. You can't
go around being apathetic about that. 

Yes, I do realize that I may not be able to change your beliefs, but I can
provide enlightenment on what is actually good for humanity"

No.  There were protests, but the were orderly and done in the right manner.  I disagree with disrespecting any religion.  But violence is not the way to show your disapproval.  Christianity today is so disrespected by the so-called ""main stream"" media and liberal religious figures, but Christians don't act like idiots about it.  We don't burn buildings and start riots.  I know most followers of Islam aren't idiots.  But those that are make the entire religion look bad.  I hope the good Muslims eventually prevail over the idiots (terrorists included)."

Keep the real bad guys in jail.  Banning guns and having stricter gun control laws only harms the law-abiding citizen.

Social Security Refrom:  Social Security as it is right now sucks.  If I had my way, I wouldn't have it taken out of my paycheck.  Either allow people to control their own retirement money with private accounts, (I don't know about you, but I trust myself with my money over the government.)  or make Social Security voluntary.  If you pay in, you get it.  If you don't you're on your own.  I'd rather have the bigger paycheck.

Elecoral College:  Get rid of it.  Allow a straight election for President.

Lower the drinking age to 18.  you can vote and join the military at 18.  But you can't drink legally.  That's stupid.

And remove age limits for running for congress and the presidency.  If you are old enough to vote, you should be able to run."

"event","""Have You Forgotten?""
performed by Darryl Whorley

I hear people saying we don't need this war
I say there's some things worth fighting for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
Before you start preaching
Let me ask you this my friend

CHORUS 1
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away?
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

They took all the footage off my T.V.
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

CHORUS 1
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away?
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And we vowed to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

CHORUS 2
Have you forgotten all the people killed?
Yes, some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon?
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?"

"event","Conservative talk show host Sean Hannidy, along with Col. Oliver North have started a charity called Freedom Alliance.  This charity, through donations, provides <i>full scholarships</i> to children who have lost parents in Iraq. Mr. Hannidy and Mr. North don't get a cut of the donations.  <b>ALL</b> of the money donated goes to the scholarships.  So far, 200 kids have received scholarships.

Democrats on the other hand would probably just raise taxes to give the kids scholarships."

"event","Those of you who have been with me for a long time remember my ex, Donnelle.  Well it seems the guy she has a kid to and has been living with for almost two years got another girl pregnant!  Of course Donnelle doesn't believe it.  She thinks people are lying just to take her ""man"" from her.  

And one more thing about the happy couple...  <i>They're related!!!!</i>  It seems Donnelle and her boyfriend are actually cousins!  LMFAO!"

But don't do it half-assed. Don't just leave for four years and think you are coming back. Give up your American citizenship and become a citizen of Canada! If you are serious and want to do it right, I think you should go all the way! So go ahead and leave. Run to the country who gave us Shania Twain, Celine Dion, Nickelback and Bryan Adams. Become a puckhead who puts mayo on your french fries!

That is all. Thank you for your attention."

"event","This is the end, Beautiful friend
This is the end, My only friend, the end
Of our elaborate plans, the end
Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end
I'll never look into your eyes...again
Can you picture what will be, So limitless and free
Desperately in need...of some...stranger's hand
In a...desperate land
Lost in a Roman...wilderness of pain
And all the children are insane, All the children are insane
Waiting for the summer rain, yeah
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the King's highway, baby
Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west, baby
Ride the snake, ride the snake
To the lake, the ancient lake, baby
The snake is long, seven miles
Ride the snake...he's old, and his skin is cold
The west is the best, The west is the best
Get here, and we'll do the rest
The blue bus is callin' us, The blue bus is callin' us
Driver, where you taken' us
The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery 
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and...then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door...and he looked inside
Father, yes son, I want to kill you
Mother...I want to...fuck you
C'mon baby, take a chance with us X3
And meet me at the back of the blue bus
Doin' a blue rock, On a blue bus
Doin' a blue rock, C'mon, yeah
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
This is the end, Beautiful friend
This is the end, My only friend, the end
It hurts to set you free
But you'll never follow me
The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die
This is the end

"event","hey guys its NEW YEARS EVE! well i am supposed to go to this show on the ship about now but i realized i have to do major getting ready. hmm i think im going to wear my homecoming dress tonight. ah im already so amazingly hyperactive from finished a whole bottle of cruzan dark rum with carly ah im getting lucky tonight =] fuck. in st.martin i bought a bottle of hypnotiq and they took it away until moi gets off the ship. fuck fuck fuck i bought it 0nly for tonight and those bitches take it away.. =[ hmm 2 nights ago was interesting. its so funny that on a cruise you can totally be with a guy one night and then the next they'd totally like be with someone else. well its actually kinda weird too but people shouldnt be getting feelings for one another on a cruise anyway. tonight hopefully will be exciting. hopefully i get lucky again ;] hey its a cruise does it really matter. everyone should have a good new years and im coming back in 3 days bitches!! okay i really should go now.

I LOVE YOU ALL!"

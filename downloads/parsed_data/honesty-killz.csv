He doesn't ask much of us.
He wants us to believe.
He doesn't want us to envy, but to love
Why do we not do these things so easily?


(chorus)
we're called to hold our hands,
against the wounds of a broken world, 
to stop the bleeding,
Heal the wounded.
Look at what our world has become.


He gives us faith.
He gives us choice.
He heals our broken hearts,
Why not trust him?

(chorus)
we're called to hold our hands,
against the wounds of a broken world, 
to stop the bleeding,
Heal the wounded.
Look at what our world has become.


Please don't ignore the bad things,
help this world...
and understand, there needs to be changes..

(chorus)
we're called to hold our hands,
against the wounds of a broken world, 
to stop the bleeding,
Heal the wounded.
Look at what our world has become."

my hands are shaking,
my heart is racing
with my undying love for you.
I've used up all of my tears.
Im searching for your heart,
but its turned to cold stone, baby.
As I lay here all alone,
my aching heart bleeds no more,
breathing in the pain you've brought upon me."

pulsating through my veins.
Im tired of looking in the mirror.
im tired of looking into your stone cold eyes.
Where you manipulate her for sex.
Its too late girl to run away he says.
Go ahead, lust. Darling go for it,
after all isn't this what you want?

I know I haven't really been around,
But im changing that.
I brought my self into a world of lies, drugs,
and despair.
I chose that life over the summer.
I didn't see myself in the mirror.
I fell in love,
and I don't have to explain this to any of you.
I used to think that if you really loved someone,
you had to prove to your friends that you loved that ""special someone.""
Listen, you don't have to prove anything to anybody.
You know what your feeling.
the crazy knots in your stomach,
the way he sucks out your air, and breathes it into you.
The way you can look into his eyes,
or if he cries when he says he loves you.
The best thing that happened to me was love, and now im worried sick about him,
and i let him slip."

"event","today was danny's funeral at mount sinai.  

for some reason my chest was overcome with a heavy pain during the entire service like a metal ball between my ribs.
 we listened to his accomplishments: 23rd in fencing in the nation, an accomplished violinst and piano player, a researcher who ironically was driven to learn about human longevity and what can lead those to fulfill a longer lasting life.  

i sat with ellie, sam and gago and my mom and we dug ground onto his grave and threw down flowers.    
ill miss you danny and i hope you are finally happy"

and i didnt even have seconds.  now thats a first.

so t-giving was quite a day.  we were supposed to volunteer but they had too many volunteers so we were turned down.  sooo i watched the macys day parade, and did some art, thought about finishing my dickinson essay, thought about jpn as usual, took a shower, went for a walk, set the tables and watched tv with dad.  then g-ma came over and dad and maddie picked up our dinner from the LA-double C.  the first t-giving my mother didnt cook.  i mean she made 2 apple pies, mashed sweet potatoes, the weirdest carrots ever and green beans... but the cc made the rest.  then i saw the other amos'.  yay for cousins home from college.  My favorite cousin wee wee... aka amylee has freaking 7 roomies... she lives in a suite.  patrick works for the athletics department and is trying to get me tickets to the ucla game... go bruins!   Uncle Danny is still the craziest guy ever, and hates being a lawyer, and wants me to get into lehigh so we can ""party it up"".  lordy.  Grandma was glad to come home early from PA and miss the snow and she saw a soldier with a big penis at Betsy Ross' house and she took a few too many pictures of the liberty bell, the crack in the liberty bell, the building they are making for the liberty bell... ok u get it.  We watched the Lakers... who won... finally, ate too much, made many hollerbach jokes (poor vj), and had a debate on sees candy.  Also, we picked our secret santa ppl for xmas.  i got patrick which means giving him money.  that was easy.

i cant sleep... again.  i watched 2 episodes of family guy and one of oprah and did some more art.  i dont feel like working 2morrow but i must must must.  I think im going to go shopping and for sure WORKING OUT.  not eating like anything.
then to katies house for some drunken fun with my friends... YAY.  i call katies bed with heather.  thank god for tomorrow evening.  

i miss you so much its crazy. jpn ! jpn @ jpn # jpn $ jpn % jpn ^  

its not fair

oh well

id rather wait.

love you MORE.     ha.

so you go to google and type in your name followed by ""needs""

so according to google Noelle needs:

Noelle needs to stay away from blue glitter on her eyes
Noelle needs help for endrometrosis
Noelle is a very special black lab mix who needs surgery to remove cataracts
Noelle needs help, as all addicts do.  
Noelle's dad needs to lighten up at playoff time, says Grandpa
Noelle Bush needs drug abuse treatment but prison is not the answer
Noelle needs to tell katie about the stop signs
Noelle needs very kind, gentle handling in a settled , adult home
Noelle needs her milk and we need to figure out a plan for Christmas dinner for the three of us.
Noelle is a model, though she's a bit stinky and needs a bath.





ok ok ok im going to study more.

but you should try this yourself.

Nothing better,the feeling is so fine
Simply put, i saw your love stream flow

lets go...

so my birthday was amazing.  thank you everyone.  party will come later... i promise, im just busy.

i got my package from the best bf in the entire world yesterday.  all i can say is it was more than amazing.... it was extraaa ordinary and perfect and ahhh i love you john patrick michael novak.  the shirt drives me crazy... oh stiff leg HA.  where are you at?  come here now. 

<b>im so lucky. </b>  

even though he'd like to disagree, too bad.  its true, its true.  i could list off all the ways he is truly one of a kind and simply amazing, but i dont want to embarrass anyone or give someone the chance to throw my complements in the trash.  &hearts;

so college applications.  ummm.  im so freaked out. seriously.  ive honestly never been more scared with the exception of maybe 2 or 3 events in my life.  its such an arbitrary process, stressful process and one that makes me think the world is going to end... more specifically on dec. 15.  so on that date if i think the world is over... it is over for me, but just for a little while.  or it may be a very happy day... but i dont know.  and the unknown is so frustrating.  

but there are things that i do know and that are constant in my life:  my hilarious/awesome friends, family, and most of all this boy who well call  jpn.  :-)


father daughter dance... omg it is going to be 100% intense!!!! pink suits, bow ties, converse tennis, party bus, TRADER VICS, ball gowns, hair, makeup... awww im so excited!  we are going to get down.  hey-oooooooo.  ... then sat 2's the next day.  fuck them.  


so i love you and i love everyone and i should study so maybe one college will be like alrighty come on down...  

austere.  i think jane austin right away.  a word she would use in one of her monotonous/ lame-o books.  yes i called her lame- o.  hmm.

so sadly im back.  back from an amazing weekend- really quite an inspirational/ thought provoking weekend. 

so i arrived early early early thursday morning, took a major nap, woke up at 1, went to see villanova at 2.  I stayed at this old mansion turned conference center which was nice cause each floor had a kitchen equipped with all the food i would want.  really really good cookies to large bottles of pelligrino... it really dosnt get better then that.  My dad and i were bored in the afernoon so we went exploring and found a pond of geese which we most definetely held a conversation with.  

friday, we drove to bethlehem, pa to see lehigh... which was.. WOW.  love it.  then we flew to piiiittttsssssbbbuuuurrrghhh.  which is officially my new favorite city to visit. but getting there... omg.  late flight, 25 minute taxi ride etc etc... but finally i saw my johhhn.  aww.  pittsburgh and john = amazing.  even though i didnt get to meet the new love in his life... his roomate adam ha ha ha.  

i had the best time with him and im determined to go visit asap.  
saying goodbye... so hard.

i really cant even describe my weekend stay in pittsburgh.  it was just amazing.  and made feelings stronger, and saying goodbye even more difficult.  so many tears, so little time.  and so much distance...  which truly makes the heart grow fonder and makes the moment of reuniting even more wonderful.  this really just came out of nowhere and smacked me in the face... but definetely is a wonderful smack.  

missing pittsburgh,
missing you...
always.

its weird being a senior.  the social environment seems not very stressful.  which is a good thing.  school is just so crazy.

college apps are killing me too.  i have too many schools and my parents are trying to make me apply to UCs... particularly UCSD cause they can get me in with my fencing. but i have no interest in going to school on the west coast.  im going east no matter wat.  i like the new college counselor.  

last night i came home exhausted from the week.  i went to dinner with the parents at the club at the beach.  after watching the sunset with my dad we played one on one bball in the gym... ha we are so cool.  then we went home and i was gonna go out but i just got really tired.  john crestani came over to give me the kanye cd and was just being dumb- then he left to go to big bear thank god. then i picked up peter drunk-he is such a dumbass. then i hung out at home. will d. came over for a bit cause davids was lame he said.  then i helped maddy with her art portfolio.  

this morning i went to the library and took a practice SAT.  sweet.
now im home.  im about to leave for my hair apt. and then to my make up apt at fred siegal.  then home for the photo shoot... ha.  then to drive maddie to a bat mitzvah then out to dinner with sam. byrnes.  UGH MOM SAYS SAM GAY IS SLEEPING OVER>>> NOOOOOOOO. i guess that means i have to entertain him 2nite.  urgh.  watever.

so last night i went to bed at around 3.  i was thinking too much (yes i know...) and so i couldnt sleep.  i had an interesting online convo, but then i finally got tired at 3.  i was rudely awakened at around 8 by my father informing me that he, my mother and brother would be gone all day golfing in some tourney at the club.  I got out of bed at 9 and went to have breakfast and found absolutely nothing in the kitchen to eat. so i watched queer eye... it was such a good episode.  Then i was talking to dubbie about getting lunch- but i was too lazy to leave my house, so i did sit ups all morning long while watching Bring it On.  Then i cleaned up the mess in the kitchen left by my parents and i cleaned my room.  I read some of my book and realized i need to paint asap. 
 My arm is still not better.  i still cant figure out how i hurt it.  oh well.  i called john.  i went for a walk.  i took a shower...... my day was blah.  
Caitlin came over and we reunited and chatted.  then we left for our favorite date spot- the brentwood gardens. We dined on sushi and tempura at taiko and then had some fro yo next door where we saw none other than MK and A.  it was truly an LA moment.  asian food and famous midgets = brilliant.  Then we headed back to my house where i decided to change. I talked to john on the phone for a bit, but he was tired and locked out of his house, so i thought i better let him go. Then i headed to LA CABANA to meet kt, monnie, heather, julie, alex and friend.  We had over $80 of margaritas... i obviously didnt have much cause i was driving.  But i am very tired and i blame it on the tequila.  Monica was so funny, same with alex. We all had QUITE the talk about SOMETHING that i cant discuss.  But it was intese and this week will be 100% intense.  omgoodnessssss.  I will be involved... i know it. I dont want to be, but its going to happen.  Then in the parking lot we chatted about the 'run' about to be made and placed orders and said our goodbyes until manana.  I finally am home and im in bed and im ready to pass out.

"event","what a crazy/ lazy couple of days

friday night= kt, dub, steve, and pat mc c and i went to chris wolfs house.  jazz music, hefner robes, THE BIG BOSS, a fire pit... then weirdos came and too much vodka w/ coke so we jetted home.  

saturday night was craZy... lots of drama, drinks and disappointment. oy

sunday = coffee and more drama created

monday = all girls 'sleepover'.  coloring books, drunk phone calls from chicago, zoolander, white wine and quesadillas.

tuesday = le movies, the spot with more awkward moments, starbucks, talk with dubbie

today= peter left for costa rica at 4 AM...E! true hollywood story, facial/massage, gym, then i was tricked into goin to hooters with dubbie, cole and mort.  ive never heard so many consecutive penis and vagina jokes.  then the hooters girls all stood on chairs and danced to YMCA... i was so over it.  Then i was given a huge group hug and i was almost crushed to death.  

i missed fro yo with alyssa and arturo!!!! NOOOOO.  



i was told that im leaving for sac-fucking-ramento 2morrow.  i have to miss shauna's breakfast.  not fair.  

so my dear shauna:

im going to miss you while you are gone.  who will see movies with me and who will walk to streets of santa monica with me?  ill write you i have the address.  tell the princes hello for me.  i hope you pick up some HOT english lad and take lots of pictures.  I love you and expect a letter soon.  MUCH LOVE AND MANY KISSES.


i hate sacramento already.  
but john is coming SOOOOON.  and when i get back life will be good again.  10 day party... GET READY

"event","summer has arrived

::applause::

what a fabulous kick off summer weekend.
party crew on thursday night, and the party mom... love you debbie. i love white russians.

friday i recooperated and then went to the graduation... so cute!  Mrs. R reminded me how my year had such losers for boys... i totally agreed.  Peter blew the foghorn when maddy graduated.  

Thheeeen...  i went home to a house lit by lanterns, tiki torches and candles with the caterers dancing around with amazing food.  But i was quickly off to pick up will who lives around the block, john, and molly (the palisadians) and we headed down to the bonfire bearing gifts of malibu and jack d. and blasting my crunk mix.  Dubbie brought his guitar.  The xroadians came.  Then TAll will (different one) invited us to his house for more party fun... but we got lost (p-sades will , john and i).  We were meeting ppl in westwood like alyssa and then i was getting really tired so i dropped will and john off and went home and saw my old computers teacher drunk off his ass and then i fell asleep at like 1 cause i had 1 hour of sleep the night before.  

Then the day of sake came.  People arrived at mi casa at like 7:15 and we left at like 8:15 and sake-ed the night away and other mmounters showed up as well.  we basically took over the front room.  Then we drove to malibu to kate's 'other' house and had an open bar to ourselves and music.  Psades will and i danced with jc and kt an some ppl went in the pool and on the beach cause the house was right there!  Then at like 1:15 we left and at 3:15 the guys left my house and we all went to sleep... after 90 pictures were taken of the evening.  I am the official documenter after all.  

i totally forgot to go to school today to 'look at my grades'... i woke up when kt came over.  she was laughing at me cause of my disheveled look.  we chatted, read some bad magazines, watched some bad tv, then she left me for her novio.  I went running then had brunch of eggs and salsa... yum.  Then went to jamba juice at like 4 with john and on an adventure throughout belair.  

2morrow is julie's birthday and the next day is sam's!!  happy birthday! i love those girls!


im excited for summer... so busy
and im also kinda nervous for summer.  i hope someone isnt disappointed or remorseful.  hmmm

well i never update fully so i thought i would cause im waiting for my ride to some fiesta.

much love to everyone

and SUMMER '05 is FINALLY HERE>>> WOOOOOOOHOOOOO

p.s. summer project = greatness

Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines 
he wrote a poem 
And he called it ""Chops"" 
because that was the name of his dog
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
and a gold star
And his mother hung it on the kitchen door
and read it to his aunts
That was the year that Father Tracy
took all the kids to the zoo
And he let them sing on the bus
And his little sister was born
with tiny toenails and no hair
And his mother and father kissed a lot
And the girl around the corner sent him a 
valentine signed with a row of X's
and he had to ask his father what the X's meant
And his father always tucked him in bed at night
And was always there to do it

Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines
he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Autumn""
because that was the name of the season
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
and asked him to write more clearly
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because of its new paint
And the kids told him
that Father Tracy smoked cigars
And left butts on the pews
And sometimes they would burn holes
That was the year his sister got glasses
with thick lenses and black frames
And the girl around the corner laughed when he asked her to go see Santa Claus
And the kids told him why
his mother and father kissed a lot
And his father never tucked him in bed at night
And his father got mad when he cried for him to do it.

Once on a paper torn from his notebook
he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Innocence: A Question""
because that was the question about his girl
And that's what it was all about
And his professor gave him an A
and a strange steady look
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door because he never showed her
That was the year that Father Tracy died
And he forgot how the end of the Apostle's Creed went
And he caught his sister making out on the back porch
And his mother and father never kissed or even talked
And the girl around the corner wore too much makeup That made him cough when he kissed her but he kissed her anyway because that was the thing to do
And at three A.M. he tucked himself into bed
his father snoring soundly

That's why on the back of a brown paper bag
he tried another poem
And he called it ""Absolutely Nothing""
Because that's what it was really all about
And he gave himself an A
and a slash on each damned wrist
And he hung it on the bathroom door 
because this time he didn't think
he could reach the kitchen.

I. Reply to this post with your name, because I would like to say a couple words about you.
II. I will also tell you what song(s) remind me of you when I hear it.
III. I will also tell you what celebrity/movie character/public person you remind me of, either personality-wise or looks-wise.
IV. I will also give ONE WORD that I associate with you when I think of you.
V. We all could use a boost now and then, so steal this for your journal and make someone else's day as well.

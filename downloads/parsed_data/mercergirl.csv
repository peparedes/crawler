"event","""Why is it that, as a culture, we are more comfortable seeing two men holding guns than holding hands?"" 
-- Ernest Gaines 

We would like to know who really believes in gay rights on livejournal. 
There is no bribe of a miracle or anything like that. 
If you truly believe in gay rights, then repost this and title the post as ""Gay Rights"". 
If you don't believe in gay rights, then just ignore this. 

Thanks."

"event","Okay, I've been on vacation and finally found something weird to comment on in my new journal. I found this article that compares finger lengths to interest in slash. Read on: <br /><br />Katherine Salmon, for example, a psychologist from the University of Redlands, decided to look for a connection between finger lengths and taste in erotica. <br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"">It's a given that many heterosexual men enjoy pornography depicting woman-on-woman sex. It's less common for women to want to think about sex between two men, but some women do enjoy stories featuring male homosexual encounters. <br /><br />Such guy-on-guy erotica often goes under the name slash fiction, not because there's any violence, but to indicate a slash between the names of the lovers. It's part of a larger genre of ""fanzine"" literature in which fans of a movie or television show write their own stories about the characters. <br /><br />Slash started in the 1970s with that sexy Star Trek duo Kirk/Spock. A quick Web search reveals dozens of stories with passages like this shower scene: ""Jim ran his free hand through Spock's wet, matted chest hair, rubbing the bronze-green nipples with his fingertips... . Spock moaned...."" The action gets much more pornographic at that point, and the pair eventually end up in a mind meld. <br /><br />Many women find this unappealing to the point of disgust, Salmon says, but others report that it fulfills a long-held desire. She wondered whether the difference could be related to testosterone, and perhaps connected to these finger-length ratios. <br /><br />To investigate, Salmon lined up 40 slash fans and 40 non-fans and measured their fingers with a pair of digital calipers. She found controls averaged a very feminine index/ring ratio of 1.04, fans .97, which is close to the typical male ratio. <br /><br />There weren't any obvious differences between the two groups, Salmon says, though a survey revealed that slash fans were more likely to have been tomboys when growing up. Some of them did also like gay male pornography. <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/living/columnists/faye_flam/14850250.htm"">http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/living/columnists/faye_flam/14850250.htm</a><br /><br />Edit: I'd say my index is longer than my ring finger.&nbsp; So what does that say about me?<br /></div>

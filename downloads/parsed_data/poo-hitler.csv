This wig was a lot of fun- it actually has a styrofoam leftover container sewed into it to achieve Bakura's bizarre hair wingspan- As always made from a high quality synthetic wig and all styled, cut, and wefted by moi"

Probably my favorite wigs yet.  Both custom dyed, cut, styled, and wefted all by yours truly. I'm not gonna even attempt to be modest here.  
We took home the first place in the Journeyman Division from Otakon for our group."

Styled from a shoulder length good quality synthetic wig.  The widow's peak was sewed onto the wig and hand-wefted-  I came up with the method all by myself since it seemed nobody else could figure it out no matter how many forums I visited. :)"

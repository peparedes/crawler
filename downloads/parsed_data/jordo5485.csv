So i followed the crowed for about an hour and finally a fight broke out. At first it was against 2 people not to say any names. Later the fight got worse and everyone started getting into it. It was crazy! parents were tring to brake it up but it was much to big to do so. Finally the cops came and everyone ran away! IT was crazy!!!"

"event","Yeah so,
Last night was crazy! Juniors vs. seniors was kickn off. Derek, Dez, Kara, Jena, Kyle and me all went out T.Ping last night and hit a few seniors. we stopped at meijer and talked to all the drunk people from the party. most of them were alright but a few were pretty trashed. After meijer we got pulled over by a cop and it almost made derek piss his pants. I thought it was great but everyone else thought it was scary. I always like it when i almost get busted it just sends a rush through me. Anyways thats it! cant wait for the weekend!

"event","<P><STRONG>Today was tight! school was so boring until theater tech hit then it was fun. Recently i've been tring to take advantage of the warm weather thats left so i decided to go to the beach and go skimboarding. After school i called around to find&nbsp; someone to skim with but everyone was going to the girls basketball game, so that didn't work out. But then my wonderful girlfriend called me and said she would go. which was defiantly fine with me because come on wouldn't any guy rather go to the beach with a&nbsp;hott chick anyday,&nbsp;than go to the beach with his friends! But i had a great time like always!</STRONG></P>"

"event","Just to inform everyone James Robert Metiva is the biggest nutsack in the world!
I mean he gets on my live journal and tells everone that i got herpies from some trucker.
This brings up a very great incident that james once asked me about. it was about winter time and little old james was sitting there poppiing white heads into his mirror. when all of the sudden he noticed a large unusually sized soar on his mouth. without any reaction james yeld out OH SHIT! at this time little jimmy had thought he had contrapted the Herpies virus. Latter that day all jimmy could think was damn i shouldn't of made out with that chick. OR man for all we know! jimmy decided he'd ask people if it looked like the virus. It was about 3:00 on a friday afternoon when i came in vision of this enormouse gigantic soar in james mouth. he asked me if it looked like herpies, and i told him it did, just to scare the shit out of him. as time whent on james contined to have brakeouts in his mouth and still unaware of what it was. So when people like james write about me having herpies when i dont by the way, just remember OH MY GOSH THERE A Fucking Soar in your mouth!"

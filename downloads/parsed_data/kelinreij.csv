"event","Greg and Dean got married today. Found out you can't just get married at the Town Hall, you actually are required to have a ceremony. They had a justice of the peace on call though, so they went to his house and held a ceremony there with the justice's wife as the witness.

Congrats you two!"

"event","Of not posting on LJ, no wait that's tomorrow. Damn! Blew it!

Oh well, a lot has happened in the past year and I don't feel like summarizing it right now (who am I kidding, I'll never get around to it). So on to recent events. 

Suni just bought a pool table, got a good deal on it at Sears for Black Friday, $200 and they had it in stock. It's a really good table for the price and looks pretty good too. I got a remote started installed on my car from Tweeter, that's the first time I've even gone ""Damn your a good salesman!"" to anyone. It's acting all weird now, alarm keeps going off when I use the remote keyless entry, and if I use the key to open the door the lights on the guages flash and it sounds like a turn signal. Weird! But I got an apointment saturday to have it reprogramed correctly along with makeing the remote open the trunk too.

I'm still going skating once or twice a week. I'm surprised I've stuck with it so long, been a couple times I thought about taking a break from it, but I keep going cause I got a couple friends that I only see there. Hopefully that'll change soon though for one of em.

Let's see, conventions... didn't go to MFF 05. Did go to FC, AC, and FF though, all were great except I was pretty sick for FF, managed to have a great time anyway. Got to see Scorch at AC, he stayed in our room. Met Skippy in person at FF, he's cuter than I thought he would be and we got along great.

That should be bout it for now. See ya next year!"

"event","Forget turkey day, this year we gave it a weekend. Spent friday night through sunday at Sym's for Thanksgiving. Went skating friday night, then got up early saturday and started cooking. This makes 3 years in a row cooking Thanksgiving dinner for Sym, except this year he actually cooked it with me. Hopefully next year I'll have it in our own house, and maybe even with my mom there too, that would be nice. Dinner was great, Turkey with all the trimmings of course. And for desert my Apple Pie of doom! along with a nice chocolate mouse pie, which turned out quite well for a first attempt. 
How good was dinner? It was sooo good we ate at 1, stretched out on the bed and watched the third Harry Potter movie, then lounged on the bed and chilled till I finally went to sleep at 8. Everyone else stayed up till like 5am, but there was no way I could manage that.
It was a great weekend, and very relaxing."

"event","Saw in the newspapers on Thursday that 7 gay and lesbian couples have filed a lawsuit in New Haven county superier court fighting for the right to recive mariage licenses and claiming that the part of the state constitution that defines mariage is unconstitutional. So at least the ball is rolling on it now. One of the quotes in the article from some politician in CT, don't remember who, hoped the issue would be decided in legislature. Anyway the court battle will end up in the CT superior court if the legislatue doesn't ok it first. Unfortunatly govoner Rell doesn't seem to be supporting such legislature, she quoted something along the lines of saying ""I think the citizens of CT are happy with the current definition of mariage""

Nothing will change soon, but at least the process is started for CT now.

"event","Haven't updated in ages, and I don't have time to catch up on that now, so let's just start with this past weekend.

Sym's Fur-B-Q was a blast! It got rained out on saturday, but that turned into a blessing as it became a two day even with only 2 furs unable to make it back on Sunday. The company was great, the entertainment a bit unusual but very entertaining none the less, and the food on sunday was really good as well. About 6pm sunday sym had to leave to take a couple furs back home, so me and sunitai took Jeil rollerskating in Groton. I've never had so much fun on a friendship skate (where 2 or 3 friends skate holding hands). We added a creative spin to the nomal slow skating couples and 3somes, by switching position constantly and seeing how fast and far we could slingshot the person on the end when going around a corner. That was a blast! Was glad me and suni got a chance to talk to him and hang out one on one for a bit.

That's all you get for now!"

"event","Because this is rather long it will not post as a comment, so I'll put it here.

I meant what I said in my last post, several things will change. 

No cutsie clothes, my leather shorts probably won't be seen in public again. 
No drinking just for the hell of it. I've never been bad about drinking, and I will still do it when there is a reason or in social situations.
All the stress from the past month has been building, since we had the first fight, and I'm not good at dealing with stress, there has been several times I've considered taking up smoking cause nothing else was helping to relieve the stress. But I will not resort to that.
No sex with mundanes, this one may be dificult occasionally, although I haven't had many offers for quite a while it seems.

I am a vain person, I admit it. But that's probably not going to change. When I'm looking for a new friend the first thing I look at is their physical appearance. I could go one for pages trying to analize why, but I'm not going to. But there are also a couple other things I look for: if they live close enough to hang out regularly (which so far no one does), if we have common interests (other than furry), if we just click (our personalities mesh and we get along and just enjoy being around each other). Out of those things though there is only 1 that I can automatically see when I look at someone I don't know, and that's if I'm physically attracted to them.
Call me a slut, but I enjoy having sex with my friends, even most of the ones I don't find to be all that close to my type. I don't have any hangups with sex (with guys), it doesn't get weird if I sleep with a friend, it doesn't make things akward, it has yet to damage a friendship (it's always possible that it could at some point, but so far it hasn't).
In my defense though, I do still talk to every person I've had sex with (fur and mundane) except for Lou cause I just wanna... well we won't go there. Some of them I haven't talked to much because I haven't seen them online hardly and that is the only way I have to contact them, and one person don't reply enough to keep a conversation going. If they come online then I do talk to them, and every one of the guys that's I've had sex with I've wanted to hang out with and develop more of a friendship with, and I've tried to arrange that but most times it seems to fall through and in a couple instances it just was not possible yet for one reason or another. 

Yes you did make me into what I've become. I followed your lead for the longest time, then I steped in front and kept going further and further. Limits are for the weak. I had no reason to stop or slow down, for the longest time I was having a lot of fun. Then I started getting full of myself, making snap comments and stating things bluntly as a smart ass quip. I liked that at first, gave me a feeling of power, then I realized how much of an ass I sounded like. 
I flaunt my sexuality, my pride ring, my earring, my flamey jacket. But that proved helpfull, it gave me courage and confidence. At first I was nervous about wearing my flamey jacket to the mall by myself, look around nervously, try to get in and out quick, stuff like that. Now I don't think anything of it. I'm comfortable with anyone and everyone knowing I'm gay, but I'm at the point now where I don't feel the need to flaunt it. I haven't worn my pride ring in a month or longer, I think I'll stick with a hoop earring instead of my gay symbol one, and my fox jacket I will save for cons and such.

It's human nature to compare what you have to what you want, but it takes a strong man to accept something less than what his heart truely desired. What's the difference in (physically) comparing potential mates to me instead of comparing them to Chester who was always your perfect physical specamine? Before you had me you probably compared potential mates or bf's to Chester. You probably even compared me to chester at first. 

Yes suni will probably move here this summer and I'll get an apartment with him, and I would still like to visit and hang out and do stuff even if you and suni aren't on good terms by then. I've invested over 2 years of my life in building a friendship with you and I'm not going to toss that aside. 

I know what I'm paying in rent is unheard of, but this house has never been my idea living situation. I never said it before, but the clutter does really bother me as does the fact that most of my stuff, which I'd spent several years collecting (all my fox and wolf statues and quilts and pillows and stuff) is still sitting in boxes 2 and a half years later. I also don't like the fact that I can't sit on the couch and watch tv, cook in the kitchen without moving tons of stuff around, or even sit at the kitchen table to eat. Those are all simple things that I really used to treasure. I'm tired of eating out 2 to 3 meals a day.
The apartment I get will probably be small, but it will be mine, my statues will be sitting around, I will stretch out on the couch to watch tv, sit at the table to eat, COOK MY OWN DINNER! and not be ashamed and have to hind half the house when anyone comes over. Ok, that sounds harsh, but I got kinda emotional there."

"event","Short and sweet. Ramblings mostly. Just trying to get some things out.

I wish I never got into ""the cutsie thing"". I wish I didn't know how to manipulate people to get what I want. I wish I was never told I was cute enough to get anything I want. I wish someone would have slapped some sense into me and made me see what I was doing. Silver tried, but I didn't believe him, I didn't think I had a problem. I thought Sym was happy, I thought he liked who I was. He made me into who I am, I thought he liked me that way. I thought I was his chester. I thought that was what he wanted. I was out of control. 
I did some things I shouldn't have. I played around with some guys I shouldn't have. I didn't pay enough attention to Sym, I didn't put him first, I didn't respect his feelings. 

To Silver, I'm sorry I was too self-richous to listen. And I'm sorry I'm not the person you thought I was. I'm not the person I thought I was either.

To Sym, Everything you've said to me reguarding our relationship is true. I'm sorry I didn't have the strength to say all this in person, but in any confrontation I just want to curling into a ball and hide away in a hole. I hope by admiting my fault I can help bring you closure, ease your pain, and help you move on. I'm sorry I'm not the person you thought I was. I'm sorry I let the power corrupt me. I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough to deal with it. I'm sorry we couldn't see this coming and avoided all the pain. I am not sorry however that I have spent the last 2 and a half years of my life with you. You are a wonderful caring person who treated me like a God, and I was not capable of dealing with that aparently. I know it will take time, a lot of it probably, for you to really forgive me, but I hope one day you'll think of me as a true friend once again.

I'm sorry..."

"event","Made it back home a couple hours ago from AC, it was a blast for the most part. Sym introduced me to another fur or two that he already knew and I met a cuttie blue fox on the dance floor friday night and spent some time with him. And of course I got to say hi to a bunch of other furfriends and artists. 

The masquerade went pretty well, not as many laughs as we hoped for, but it was still good fun.

Decided I wasn't going to splurge as much at this con, fixing my new car (see previous posts) and my Palm dieing cut my funds lower than I prefer. So I didn't buy ANY art, WOW that's a first. But we don't have space for the stuff we already have so it's no big deal. I'm just glad for the opertunity to socialize and meet furs.

I wish you coulda been there Suni."

"event","Alright time for a major update, since I haven't posted in god knows how long.
Furry Pride was a blast, had more to drink than I usually do, then again I don't usually party for like 10 hours straight. 
Toronto's Pride Parade on Sunday was fun as well, the weather was perfect, warm with a good breeze and no rain till a good half hour or more after the parade was over. Fortunatly I didn't really burn, just got a little red, I did think ahead to use sunscreen. 
Work has been kinda tame lately, nothing really fell apart while I was out of the country for the long weekend. Let's hope my luck holds out for AC, I think it should, it's Feral that may be a challenge. I have 3 good people right now, plus a couple others I have a few concerns with, however come August 1st 2 of those (good people) are moveing out of state. But I just hired someone who does have good potential, now as long as she stays honest I should be ok.
And Suni, if your reading this, the arcade in Toronto was pretty boreing without you."

"event","After a relatively normal day, which I'll skip cause it's irrelevant right now, me and silvermoonwolf went up to Mirrabar in Providence to dance and such. Had a lot of fun, danced with a few really cute boys. Two am came around, we left, went back to the parking garage, and found my winshield smashed.... Fuck!
Someone aparently steped on the hood and kicked the bottom passanger side of the winshield, leaving it cracked decently good and leaving a dent in the hood along with a scratch or two. Aparently that wasn't enough though cause they also kicked and dented the front license plate. Ow! Hurt me bad boys! We checked the car over good and didn't find anything else wrong with it so we drove it home and I just called Geico so hopefully I can get it fixed quickly and not to expensively.
The part that annoies me the most is I've tried so hard to keep it in new condition, I've only made 2 payments on it.
Sometimes people just suck!"

Plans to meet a local guy after work were canceled, by the other party.
Sym is off with Shadow visiting another fur or something, I think. He probably will be back just in time to go to work.
I'm lonely and bored.

The regional manager's meeting was yesterday, didn't really seem as long as the meetings before, was rather enjoyable actually, good opertunity to socialize with my co-workers and my supervisor. After that I went to a different store and helped clean it up a bit for an inspection he was expecting today, dunno if it happened or not. So! That and the good audit just sinched me my vacation time for FC! Yay!

Ok, work out of the way onto my personal life. Thanksgiving was great, well not the day it's self, but the dinner I had 3 days afterwards. For the holiday I actually worked 13 hours, but I get vacation pay for it so all the better. Sunday I fixed a turkey with all the trimmings and a dutch apple pie for desert. Started cooking about 6am, cooked until we ate at about 1. I enjoyed it very much though, and the food tured out rather well. Sym seems to really like my apple pie, next time I have to make it less runny somehow. Also discovered that I DO like wine. Sym picked out a nice strawberry zinfadel (SP?) which I ended up having about half a big bottle of in the course of the evening. It was Me, Sym, and his mother for dinner, and for the first time since I moved up here I felt... like I was with family. A feeling that got tossed to the way side a year and a half ago when I moved out from my mother's home.

I wonder what happened to Sunitai. I haven't heard from him... since before MFF. I assume he's trying to go on with his life and be the good little mormon boy he's told he wants to be. He always tried to do what was best for me, and I do regret that I let him do that until he gave himself an ulser from the stress and worry. Perhaps now it's my turn to be strong for him, time has made me stronger, but part of me is sad to admit that I am finally strong enough to let him go completely. Except for the memories, those I will treasure until the day I die, and if there is life after death they will go with me wherever that is.

There will come a point when memories are worth more than life.
Live your dreams and leave nothing to regret.

And if you ever read this Suni, I hope life brings you all you could ever want and more."

Work managed to survive without me from thursday morning to monday morning, I'm pleased that it went as smoothly there as it did, little surprised too.

The con was great, I knew I was alive for a reason! heheh. Got to work 3:30 thursday morning, left work 7:30 same morning, drove about 6 hours, picked up SilverMoonwolf, took turns driving another 7 or 8 hours and arrived at MFF about 8 that night.

Not a lot happened that night, just kinda hung around chatting and stuff. Friday morning, got up bright and early, shaved from the ears down and got all set to parade around in all my skimpy cutie outfits. The variety show was at midnight, dunno how I managed to stay up that late, but it was great! Sym's act got a huge response, probably the best out off all the acts. And of course I ate up the opportunity to be on stage and be the center of attention, well, least in part.

The dance saturday night got off to a rough start, but was more decent as the night wore on. I made it to almost the end before I crashed, caffeine, sugar and alcohol wasn't enough to get me all the way through it :o( That and my leather shorts look damn good, but they get a bit uncomfortable after too much dancing.

Sunday I won the piece I wanted that went to voice auction, the Rog Minotaur (adult!) clock. Won the piece in the general auction as well, but it didn't go to voice, it was a wolf head etched on glass with celtic knotwork trim. Spent a little more than I wanted to on those two, but it was worth it I think. Now where the hell do I put em!?!

Left sunday about 3, hit a few flurries on the way home, but got ahead of the storm and had a clear ride most the way. Got home monday morning just in time to take a bath and go to work at 9am (I usually go in at 4:30, but had arranged otherwise).

I had a great time, snuggled up with my bf every night, really enjoyed the time I spent with a close friend I don't see often, improved the ""friendship level"" with another friend, had the opportunity to meet a new face or two and got to talk to a new admirer who I'd seen before but never talked to."

"event","Yesterday was a rather long day.
After 12 hours at work by myself, I almost make it home, and a half mile from my exit my car overheats. Busted radiator hose. Thankfully it was split at the very end where it connects to the block. It was kinda dark and I couldn't see, didn't have a light in the car that works.
Ok, so I tried tapeing it up with electrical tape, the only kind I had in the car hopeing it would get me home where I could fix it. No luck. Made it to the bottom of my exit ramp and smoke pours everywhere. Two minutes later a cop pulls up, takes me home and I get some tools, a flashlight, and a ride to go back and fix it. 
Was easier than I expected to fix, just cut 2 inches off the hose and reclamp. Quick stop on the way home for a couple quarts of oil, oh yeah, I forgot to mention that somehow my oil cap was off and laying under the hood by the brake lines. Don't know how long it was like that, but it was 2 quarts low.
Made it home, gave it a good drink of oil and tried to sop up some of the 2 gallons of antifreeze it spewed out in the course of things.
7pm, I'm home, my temperature light is still on, figure it hasn't sucked in any of the antifreeze I put in the overfill tank.
7:30, take bath. Get interupted by call from work. The person I had on to train tonight never showed or called. Grrr! The person closing my store was going to have a bit of a rough night to get everything done by himself.
Wait till morning, ie. 3:30 am when I get up to go to work, add a gallon and a half of antifreeze, scrape the frost off the windows and go to work. The temperature light stays off.
Seems like it's doing ok now, before I left from work today I checked the coolant and added another half gallon to top it off.

I wanna new car!"

Good news on the work front, I decided to take the Portland store, so as of this morning I am the manager assigned to that store. Meaning today was my first day on salary, no more hourly work for me! Well, for the most part anyway.... 

My supervisor offered me more than I was expecting, only down side is that since I didn't accept the position by the start of the new quarter (October 1st), I'm not elegiable for the bonuses until Janurary 1st. But in the meantime I'm makeing about $50 more a week than I was expecting. Can't wait till <lj user=""Sympolarbear""> gets back home so I can compare notes, I may give the bear a run for the money next year on who makes more! *giggles* Not that it really matters, but still....

Talked to both my parents and my grandmother this past week. My mom is doing good, my grandma recognized my voice, and my dad is doing ok too. When I was growing up, and all the way through highschool I always said I could never leave West Virginia, it was my home and was where I belonged. Funny now that I look back at it I think God that I got out when I did. 

Sometimes I feel guilty that I have it so easy. My mom and stepdad do ok, but my stepdad works so hard and mom keeps the budget tight. My sister and her husband and pretty much dirt poor, but they are happy and very much in love so I'm very happy for them both. My dad is in sort of a mild late midlife crisis, he switched positions at Dow and is taking classes to be an electrician there instead of a pipefitter. I guess he does ok too, but takeing care of grandma (his mom) takes a lot out of him mentally and economically. She's in a nursing home close to him, but he takes care of all her bills and finances.

And here I sit, management job with good pay. Very few expenses, no financial worries, the only stress I have comes from my job. I'm planning to slurge on a nice car come spring, and very much looking forward to co-buying a nice house of our own in a couple years.

Kinda makes all the little daily problems seem rather miniscule."

"event","Ok, ok already. I'll update my freaking journal! *giggles*

Let's see what has happened since... last week I guess. Hmmm, the most noteable thing is when Sym took me out Monday evening to celebrate me haveing moved in with him a year ago as of the 10th. We got all dressed up, at least more so than we had in a while, and went to the Steak Loft. He wasn't going to tell me where we were going till we got there, but his mother, kind soul that she is, guessed the restaurant when she saw us all dressed up and he told here we were going over in Mystic. So I found out that way before we actually left.

The dinner was great! Had a huge angus ribeye cooked to perfection with some kind of wine sauce I could have sworn was gravy. Definatly the best meal I'd had in a long time! 

Not really much else to report on besides work. I think I'm going to take the Portland store after all. Hopefully I'll be able to compensate for the extra hour of driving per day by getting out an hour early like 3 days a week, which won't affect my pay any cause I'd be on salery. The hard part with this store is putting together a good crew, but I have at least one good employee, a couple that are average and a couple good applicants, plus one assistant quality person I can borrow some times from another store.

That's really the only hard part though, the store is a lot slower paced than what I'm used to, so I get everything done early and have time to work on improving things. Most every weekend off would be a nice benefit too."

"event","Got started at my new store today, was rather calm which was kinda surprising. The store isn't in as good of shape as I was expecting, but hopefully I can get through the next week with ONLY 70 hours, some goal huh? I really should be sound a sleep by now, considering I have to get up at 3:30 to go back and open, but since I closed yesterday and didn't get up till 10:30 this morning, I'm not tired right now so I'm way too mentally alert to sleep. Found out today that the person that is closeing my store full time just started this past Monday, so tonight is his 5th shift. But on the good side he did come on board as a manager in training, so he seems competent... he just needs training!

Ok yes, I bitch a lot about work, but really I love it. Otherwise why would I be so devoted to it huh? Couldn't be the temptation of all the money now could it? I discovered that I DO have expensive taste, so I guess it's good that I don't mind working so much to afford it. Besides, I like being the boss *grins* .... even if it means long hours *whimpers*

Wonder what's made me so moody lately? heh, if you can't guess then you don't know me all that well *chuckles*

I think one of them was Mountain Dew brand, anyway I'm happy that I can get away from wearing jeans at work all the time. 

Don't know when my next day off will be, work is going to be... interesting... for the next month. Starting friday I'm going to be manager at the Portland Cumberland Farms, I was offered the store as my own, but I don't want to drive that far to work every day on a long term basis. A 50 hour minimum work week is enough without adding an hour drive time ONEWAY every day. At least I'll be off nights, but that means getting up at like 3:45am again.

Sym got off work really early last night, made it home by 10 so we rented Panic Room, ON VHS cause the Blockbuster we go to doesn't participate in the ""Guaranteed to be there, New Release"" program. DVD's are much better! It was a good movie though."

My supervisor offered me my own store but it's a 45 - 50 minute drive, and during the summer it would be at least an hour drive home in kinda heavy trafic every day. So I turned it down. I'll wait for a store within a half hour drive.

Sym is off at the Pandaguy picnic in DC this weekend, I would have gone with him, but weekends off are hard for me to get right now so I'm saving it for the halloween party in toronto. Then I can get the leather jacket I want made at North Bound Leather.

I have tomorrow off and still have no plans for anything, other than meeting Sunitai online at 2:15 to chat for an hour or so while he's between classes.  DJ did actually call last night while I was at work, so maybe I'll give him a call in the morning and see if he's going to be up for anything.

I did make it to the gym today, first time for this week. Probably be the only time this week, I wish they were open all night, I'd much rather work out after work then before.  My routine has been kinda hard on my back so it was actually good to take it easy for a week, but I got a massaging mat yesterday and hopefully it will help the muscles to relax. Hmmm, speaking of that, think I'll just go vibrate for about 15 minutes or so now."

It seems like if I'm around someone to talk to I'm fine, I only get depressed or kinda out of it when I'm alone. I don't even have to be talking with them, I just need to know they are there. If no one else is there then I start wishing Suni was, I'm not as over him as I thought I was.
Went to the bar last night after work, Sym got out of work early so I joined him about 12:30. Had fun dancing, saw DJ but really only said hi. I wish he'd take more interest in me, he's so cute, but he always seems to have his attention elsewhere. Anyway, it was fun and I got more of a buzz than I expected from my White Russian, they make em kinda strong. 
The rose Sym bought me is starting to wilt, but it brightened up the room for a few days, I could smell it everytime I walked by it."

Late last night I did talk for a little bit to a local guy I found on gay.com. He sounds like he'd be good to hang out with.

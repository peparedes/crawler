Now, first of all, I have to say on its behalf that it's wicked <STRONG>wicked</STRONG> good.&nbsp; The only part that befuddles me is that on the can is a picture of&nbsp;a totally old school soda glass, and written over this is the words ""fountain classics"".&nbsp; </P>
<P>mkay. so.</P>
<P>This totally does NOT make sense.&nbsp; How in the world is the classic Dr. Pepper, to which 2 extra flavors made of odd chemicals has been added and from which all of the calorie / carb producing ingredients have been extracted, classified as a ""fountain classic""?!&nbsp; </P>
<P>That is what I would like to know.&nbsp; Plus, can someone explain to me how they get fizzies in soda, and why it goes out after a bit?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ALRIGHT well that's it for my soda rave.&nbsp; Now to business.&nbsp; Not much has been happening, but I did go to get the 6th harry pottah book, and proceeded to finish it in 2 days.&nbsp; I understand that others may find that kind of pathetic, like my cousin mike,&nbsp;seeing as he finished in like.. a night and day.&nbsp; But still.&nbsp; So my thoughts on the book?&nbsp; Overall it was good, because I just love harry potter, but personally I think this one had nothing on say, the fourth book.&nbsp; which totally rocked.&nbsp; Also I really didn't like the ending.&nbsp; Kinda made me want to just.. ( gasp ) stop reading harry potter.</P>
<P>Still a good book though.&nbsp; recommended to you from me!</P>

"event","<P>It is only the third day of summer, and I am already totally bored.&nbsp; </P>
<P>BUT I LOVE IT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^_^</P>
<P>I want to go to the beach.. I can't though because I'm leaving for my camp tomorrow for the weekend.. I abosolutely love having a summer camp because you can just go and swim and tan and read and play card games with various family members and go for rides on the boat and go tubing and sleep and tan some more and SLEEP for as long as I friggan want..&nbsp; I love summer!!!</P>
<P>I am in a really good mood! woo!&nbsp; I was so hyper last night, It was really creepy.. and I was like running around my house laughing wicked loud and it was like 1 in the morning hahaha...&nbsp; and then my brother (who doesn't sleep, I swear to god..) came out of his room and yelled at me.&nbsp; Which only made me laugh harder, of course.. you know that feeling when you really <EM>shouldn't</EM> be laughing but you just can't stop yourself, and the fact that you <STRONG>can't</STRONG> stop makes you laugh even harder, and then you end up with a wicked bad stomach ache because you laughed so hard?&nbsp; I love it when that happens ahhhaha...</P>
<P>Well... what else...............................................I'm redecorating my room at camp.. basically that means new everything, which is WICKED cool because I have the best room in the house (aka the attic) and it really needs decorating.&nbsp; So thats what I'm doing.&nbsp; And I have new comforters and pillows and other pillows and curtains and lights and rugs...and a mirror.&nbsp; And I'm painting a lot of stuff white when I go up this weekend, because everything in there is kinda cool and old fashioned, but with all the new stuff I have, the black iron doesn't really go, so I'm painting a couple of black things white so that I can keep the old theme and have it match.</P>
<P>I really REALLY want to go to OOB though.. I have like the hugest craving for ocean.</P>
<P>Guess that's it for now, I'll update when I get back!&nbsp; Cause I will definitely be tan and my hair will be all blonde from the sun like it gets every summer.. and then .. yeah I will come back to my boring life here in Maine and I will sit in my room and think to myself.. ""I guess I'll update my livejournal now"" and then.. you will get to read more about my life.&nbsp; </P>

"event","<P><FONT size=2>I have a website for you all to go to and worship.. its called <A href=""http://www.cdzinc.com"">www.cdzinc.com</A>&nbsp; .&nbsp; I have such a passion for this website..basically what it does is you go into it, click on 32k or 16k, i dont really think it matters.. then you go to search, and type in a song, an artist, whatever, and it gives you a list of results. then you click on the right one, which it has always had for me, and you can play ANY SONG ON THAT CD FOR FREE AS MUCH AS YOU FRIGGAN WANT.&nbsp; I think it's pretty sweet, myself.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>umm..today I went to the mall with sanja and we saw frank (sm) and curtis. it was pretty funny, seeing as they totally left us.. but whatever.&nbsp; We had HUGE problems finding both of the things that we went to the mall for, except i bought shoes (which i needed) and sanja and i both bought some kick ass shorts, me a shirt, and we both got THE BEST EVER IN THE WORLD hats and sunglasses.&nbsp; which we will SO be&nbsp;wearing all the time, you know it!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>plus i have 2 new sweatbands.&nbsp; which are sort of pointless for me, seeing as first of all i dont sweat so much that it runs down my arms, and second of all i don't have any reason to keep sweat off of my hands, even if i was terribly hot.&nbsp; which.. im not. so there we go.&nbsp; except it is extrememly hot in my room right now.&nbsp; I actually slept on my couch downstairs last night because i forgot to get a fan in my room, and it was like 100000000000000 degrees, plus it was cold downstairs where we have air conditioning.&nbsp; soooo basically i had a shitty night sleep.&nbsp; I never realized how hard it is to sleep on a couch, but it really is.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>i have learned a new song on guitar, woooo!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>plus today i bought a soda.&nbsp; it was YUMMYLICIOUS!&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I have a bug bite on my hand.&nbsp; i bet that kinda changes your life's direction, doesnt it?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>IT'S ALMOST THE END OF SCHOOL. SWEET!??!! YES!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>alright, obviously i am running out of things to say, because i keep starting new topics with new sections in&nbsp;this sweet-almost-at-the-end-of-school-entry. so i guess i will be typing more later, since my fingers are starting to hurt anyway.&nbsp; Bar chords are a bitch.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>umm.. yesterday night i went over to luke's with lauren and we played some mad ddr.&nbsp; It was wicked fun.&nbsp;we unlocked mission mode and that's pretty much what we did the whole time. its actually really hard, for anyone who cares what i'm saying about ddr ^_^</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I guess nellie called me a little bit ago, so I should probably call her back.&nbsp; I think we are doing something today, and then i guess we might be going to rob's with like.. molly and chris and mike.&nbsp; so that could be fun, except, you know, for that whole chris+molly and rob+nellie thing. hahahah.. oh well!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Umm.. what else.. oh yeah! I got a new monitor for my computer, its sweet, a flatscreen 17"".&nbsp; <STRONG>Super</STRONG> awesome.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>hahahaha</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Today, I am going to shower and then I am going to play tennis with Benny-boo. (thats what my brother's nickname is. all of a sudden he is such a pimp. I'm not kidding. He has way more girl friends then guy friends, like a ratio of 20 to 3. It scares me. On the other hand, he is still a loser at home, his girls just don't realize it. [Possibly I am just jealous that he is having much more luck with girls then I am with guys.] I dislike my brother.) We were supposed to go a while ago (like in days) but we didn't because it rained. Now its sunny and we are definitely going. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>my dog will not shut up. He barks all the time, I may have to murder him.&nbsp; only kidding. I love my dog ..&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I used to spend a lot of time on my entries like with the colors and whatnot.. Now I am just too lazy to do any of that stuff.&nbsp; I wish it did the colors automatically.

<P><FONT size=2>today I'm going to go through all of my clothes and get rid of a ton of stuff that I've had since like 5th grade and is just sitting at the bottom of my closet.&nbsp; Plus I need to go shopping for this season.&nbsp; in the words of my mother, ""I'm only taking you shopping if you clean out your room of all the clothes you never wear.""&nbsp; So this means that the homeless people will be getting new clothes, how generous and kind am I?&nbsp; ^_^</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>We have absolutely NO Homework this entire vacation, and I am so happy about this.&nbsp; I am kinda surprised but oh well, that doesnt really matter.&nbsp; It is so beautiful outside right now, but I don't have anything to do, so I will probably just end up staying inside today..&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Oh yeah, spring track starts the week we go back, so that will be really awesome.&nbsp; I love spring track so much,&nbsp; it makes me such a happy camper. haha.&nbsp; I guess since I haven't been running for like 3 weeks (since indoor ended) I should go for a run today.&nbsp; My dad goes for runs with me, is that weird?&nbsp; I think its fun cause I beat him ^_0</FONT></P>

"event","My computer is having issues, and I am pretty sure that I won't be able to do much on it until I fix it.  Which won't happen.  But apparently I can still do livejournal and thats all ok with me.

I just walked back from Bruni's with my neighborly neighbor Jen, and earlier today she was taking emo pictures of my car, so that's pretty cool.  I suppose my car is now photogenic hahaha

Now Jen has a song about a bean supper according to a sign by a church on a road.  We found lots of wicked awesome litter on the side of rt. 237, wow I just cannot believe how much awesome stuff is on the side of roads in north gorham.  If people have not been walking on the side of a road up here, I would most definitely suggest it to them.

At the bean supper, at the bean supper, there'll be beans (I swear!) and franks, and that homemade...lemon pie.

that's jen's song right there, yo.

A 7 hour track meet is a very LONG time.  Especially when you are there from 2:30 to 9:30, and your SINGLE 45 second long event is at 9:30.  This is only made better by the fact that everyone else has to sit there with you, so we resorted to some fun things like throwing rotten bananas, throwing bags of peanuts at people and narrowly missing other people's heads, getting yelled at by mr. wilkinson for being stupid, and other such things.  It was actually pretty funny, I thought. Then again I wasnt the one being yelled at *cough cough*

Anyway, now Im going to go play ddr, since I havent in a while.  Bye!"

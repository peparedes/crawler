"event","It seems my younger brother (he's 27) was taken to the hospital last night along with his friend Mike....Why you ask?   It seems that my brother and Mike went 4wheeling down a canal around midnight and were attacked by 6-11 PITBULLS.  The story goes like this,
My brother just fixed his 4wheelier and they were testing it at the canal that runs behind our complex Mike jumps off and my brother takes his turn as he starts tp pull away from Mike a gang of pitbulls attack Mike, my brother them jumps off the 4wheelier and starts to kick and punch the dogs only to be knocked down by them.
My brother proceeds to grab sticks and rocks but to no avail....Mike is still getting attacked.  My brother reached for his cell phone to call 911 screaming he's being attacked by pitbulls and his location over and over again cuz the phone was knocked outta his hand.  Within 3 min about 20 cops showed up weapons drawn, the dogs see the cops and lunge for them, meanwhile my brother and Mike are yelling SHOOT THE FUCKERS, and the cops did just that only killing one and the rest ran off.
My brother has punctur wounds up and down his arms, a chunk of flesh bitten outta his but cheek, and a chunck of flesh outtal his knee, and a few stiches behind his knee.
Mike has about 300 puncture wounds all over him besides his throat and face."

Well, they tell me Im calling the wrong # I have to call the fuckin court house to get that information (cocksuckinmotherfuckers), I called at 8am and they tell me that his court date is TODAY and 8 fuckin 30 am.
Now mind you I live about 45 min from the court house and that's not with traffic, So I hop in my car (still in my PJ's) and speed all the way there....I get there at 9:10!  Well, thank God the Judge was late and hadn't seen anyone yet.
       They offered my brother 6 months (for unpaid fines) he refused.  My brother then tells them about all the shit with his accident and his surgeries on his arms and his leg.  They came back with 15 days and they will put a judgment on the unpaid fines, which means he has a lien against him and if ever he wanted to buy something it would go against him...I guess.  So he accepted that plea bargain, I asked the probation officer what the total amount of his fines were and she said $978.00 So I told her I will pay that now if they will release him today she said ""NO I want him to do the time""..FUCKIN BITCH!!!!!

So we went to Hot Topic and she was dancing around like always looking for something to get, she picked out Rainbow Brite, some nightmare before Christmas (Jack) barrettes and a gothic Hello Kitty glitter dome (when you shake it there is glitter and bats).  The chic at Hot Topic was amazed that she wanted that kinda stuff and asked Lexi (my nieces name) if she or I picked it out....Lexis answer ""Duh Im carrying it aren't I"" and she said that last Christmas she had gotten the Living Dead Dolls and Lunch Box.
I love my Niece"

A few months back he had major surgery on his left eye do to a clogged vein leading to his retina. Well, now he has a hemorrhage in that same eye that has caused his loss of sight. Now his right eye is totally blind and has been that way for 15 years.  
So now I am taking care of his wife who just came home from the nursing home (she broke her hip) and My boss who can't see.  I never 
realized how hard it is taking care of the elderly. So I give a big Kudos to those in the medical field and the nursing field, the home health care industry."

You Suck 

I know you're really proud 'cause you think you're well hung
But I think it's time you learn how to use your tongue (yeah)
You say you want things to be even and you want things to be fair
But you're afraid to get your teeth caught in my pubic hair
If you're lying there expecting me to suck your dick
You're gonna have to give me more than just a token lick
Well, you may like it but you better learn how
'Cause it's your turn now

(chorus)
Now, you suck
Suk it hard
Go down, baby
You suck
Lick it hard
And move your tongue around

If you're worried 'bout babies you can lower your risk
By giving me that special cunnilingus kiss
It's on your face that I'm gonna sit
You can wiggle you can jiggle your tongue on my clit
Don't worry about making me have an orgasm
Just take your time and do it with enthusiasm
I can tell it's making you scared just thinking of it
But you better learn to love it

(chorus x2)

When you hear 'safe sex' you snicker under your breath
We've gotta take cover we're flirting with death
AIDS is our problem, we've gotta talk
Break out your dental dam and your latex sock
I'm your latex lover wrapped like a gift
Got my microwave plastic wrap heating up my clit, wooh!
Dinner's on, get busy with my booty
Got a couple of flavors, sweet licorice and fruity
I know you said luscious pussy with a cover
I'm aching too, we can't taste each other
There's no slacking off with an unprotected stroke
This aint no joke

Sisters..sisters, you've got the power...use it!

chick: You brought a condom, right?
dude: Huh?
chick: I'm unprotected.
dude: Ain't you on the pill?
chick: Oh, that was great and everything, but you know, I think it's your turn to go down on me.
dude: Oh, I'm tired, I'm tired..
chick: What do you mean you're tired?
dude: C'mon..
chick: Come on, baby, come on!..
dude: No, no, that's awful...that tastes terrible!
chick: You asshole! You shit!

I know you think it's a real drag
To suck my cunt when I'm on the rag
Quit making up stories, ah, give me a break
'Cause I really don't believe that you've got a headache
You tell me it's gross to suck my yeast infection
How do you think I feel when I gag on your erection? ugh!
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Get your face between my thighs

(chorus x2)
Now, you SUCK!"

"event","What was once simple logic is now a bewildering 
maze of altered conditions. 
The more I try to focus, the more blurry things become. 
You get what you ask for but it maybe in a different form. 
Maybe I didn't expect to be here, but there's still time to make the best of it. 
I will do whatever necessary to grab the first fresh moment of the day 
between the cobwebs of my dreams and the stinging memory 
of yesterdays mistakes. 
I've been in my own little world for so long I had forgotten 
what its like to be alone. 
Some offhand remarks carry the weight of official statements. 
I struggle everyday with my shadow self and my evil twin 
in hopes of the right one prevailing 
the bottom line for the most part is that everyone seeks their 
own pleasures and hopes none gets hurt. 
But it doesn't always work that way all the time someone 
gets hurt in the end of it all. 
If I pretend hard and long enough that it doesn't bother me I may 
even convince myself that life is just one big confusing game of give and 
take. Like opponents standing ready to pounce on the first sign of 
weakness, so I wont give them the satisfaction of seeing me squirm. 
The same old thing suddenly feels like a ridiculous waste of time. 
Everyone uses a person as a stepping stone at some point in their life 
only to realize that perfection is only in their state of mind. 
If you have to make a decision based on guesswork, remember you might not get a second chance. 
Some believe that there's a person without substance behind you dazzling 
facade, but soon you'll prove them wrong. 
But why am I still playing the game? 
When I look around, there aren't any other players on the field....are there? 
I think about whether or not there is a reason I haven't noticed that everyone has called a time out. 
Is it possible that I might be in love with the process that no longer serves any real purpose. 
The people around me cant believe how well I seem to know what's going on in their heads, my guesses are so accurate that they make me look like a genie 
I really cant believe he remains my constant companion for yet another 
fun-filled day. 
But I cant quite put my finger on it, something around me has changed 
Something is different in my world ---maybe its me. 
And yet the wild ride continues between us!!"

It was a good 30 min session, when I was about to climax, I never let him see the orgasm face I always hide in the pillow but for some unknown reason I sat strait up and I dug my nails in his shoulder and as I finished I opened my eyes and he's looking right at me with a big shit eaten grin. All I could say was ""AHHHHHHH good stuff."""

It's hard everytime father's day comes around... it's been about 6 years now since my dad has passed away... I really miss him and it's so hard to believe he's gone after all this time. He was the best dad any one could ever have. His personality and humor was loved by everyone. He'll always be apart of me and even though he isn't here to hear me say this I just want to tell him Happy Father's Day..."

"event","It's raining. A little more than it should. But it's comforting to sit here and watch it. I'm at school wasting away until summer break comes. Only today and tomorrow... and of course thursday for exams, but I only have to be here until 12:15. 

I'm leaving thursday after exams for VA. Jason's picking me up. I think he's nuts for driving almost 11 hours in one day, but he really wants me at his graduation, and i want to be there too. I'm not sure when I'll be back... possibly Monday or Tuesday. It's nice not to worry about the days as much with school letting out. 

Summer Plans:
- get a job
- make lots of money
- buy a good camera
- work on my website
- write more of my book
- read more
- go to Heritage for camp!
- go running or biking just about everyday
- go to Warped Tour!
- go camping the 4th of July
- visit the guys in cinci. 
- paint my room
- go skiing and jet skiing again
- sell my car and get a new one
- see some good movies
- go to FL?
- buy the new Rufio CD
... who knows what else. but that's what I'm going to try and do this summer, at least be productive and not waste away inside."

"event","Today was such a long day. I actually had a life outside of the computer. My goodness I'm pathetic. I have a journalism exam to get done procrastination always gets me in trouble... It's due tomorrow and I've only got one page of the article done, well not even that *thinks of ways to b/s the whole assignment*...maybe if I make the test bigger? ...maybe...???

I'm sad right now and extremly tired. School is almost out. Three more days and one exam day, for me at least...

missing someone...

it's like... you can feel their presense on you, and that moment you can almost breathe, but only for a second, and all your pain goes away, b/c deep inside you know that that same person just might be thinking of you at the same time... and when it rains, you walk outside just and stand there to feel the rain falling on you, and you feel their tears and you know everything is right with them... that eventually you know u will see them again, maybe in ur dreams, or in reality, but whichever you know there will always be that feeling in ur heart that won't go away and that's what makes you miss them every second and it's a feeling so beautiful, but so horrifying at the same time b/c you have that urge to be with that person, to be one with them for just a moment... and to be with them would be such a rush and time would be lost within itself and you in each other...

yeah, I'm done... sleepy time..................night ZZZzzzz...."

"event","I know we've been inactive for quite a while, but my band, 

Nigh Eve, is playing at the Cartersville Civic Center Battle of the Bands this Friday (11/10/06) night.


The show starts around 5:30 PM; we will not play until about 7:00pm, or a little later (they haven't given us an exact time.)

It's $10 at the door and there are a lot of really talented local bands playing with us, including The Enders and The Mandrake Theory, so PLEASE come out and support all of us if you can possibly make it.

I know it's short notice, but we were just recently added to the bill to replace Circean, who dropped from the competition.

If you haven't heard my band, then go to www.myspace.com/nigheve and listen to a track, and see what you think.

Here are directions from Marietta:
75N to exit 288 Cartersville/Main Street
Stay right at the fork
Left onto GA-113S/East Main Street
Stay straight, turns into West Main Street

The address is 435 West Main Street, Cartersville, GA 30120.

Thanks in advance..."

"event","I hate my nose.

Returning to work hasn't proved as nice as sitting at jury duty.

I've been working on a new Nigh Eve web site. I really like the way it's looking.

Geoff has been working on a new recording of Elastic Man. It sounds a-fucking-mazing.

I really like the enter button.

I'm feeling very tense. I need a vacation."

Ok, well...don't kill me.....but get me away from here, i'm dying. play me a song to set me free. nobody writes them like they used to, so it may as well be me, here on my own now after hours, here on my own now on a bus, think of it this way you could either be successful or be us, with our winning smiles, oh us, with our catchy tunes, oh us......i believe that i've lost it, and a belief is harder to change than an idea....."

"event","One of the ladies in the office is moving to Philadelphia, and her position is going to be open. I think I'm going to go for it. I feel that it's stiff competition though. It would be a raise from $26432/year (without accounting for the overtime) to $29175/year, but it would also mean moving to monthly pay instead of biweekly.  I would really have to buckle down with my loose spending as I would be getting a smaller number of paychecks, but they would be bigger than the ones i get now. Yep. The title change is not bad though: I would go from ""Senior Accounting Assistant"" to ""Accountant I"". Someday, when I have to look for a job somewhere else, they're going to think I know what an accountant really does."

"event","Ok. I need some serious adjustment. Either a vacation or something else that's soothing. It seems that every customer that comes up to work frustrates me in some way. I know most of them are asses, but some of them are very nice people. It seems to not matter anymore, they all piss me off. On top of that, Peggy feels that she needs to give us more and more of her job. Grr. Arg.

It also doesn't help that they won't turn off the heat. Maybe that's the real problem here."

<b><i>MY DOG IS GREEN!!!</i></b>

It appears that he knocked over a plastic container that Susan had put some <b>pastel green interior house paint</b> in, and then he sat in the resulting puddle.

If anyone knows how to get paint off of a dog, I'd really really appreciate.
Otherwise, i am the owner of ""Jake: The Multicolor Puppy Dog"""

We're purging our NSF files (the amount of people who bounce checks is fucking ridiculous - there are two entire filing cabinets full of them). And it seems that everyone who has an attitude today.

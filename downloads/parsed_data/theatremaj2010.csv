I thought I was out of that phase of my life.  Oh well.  OOOOOO, guess who I spoke to not too long ago...David.  yea, I know.  But it was just a random conversation to get some closure on things.  He called me later on that week to show me his true colors.  Asshole.  I'm over it all."

I'm on the verge of tears, but I don't know what I am sad about.  I just want to cry but the tears won't come.  I have soo many things to do, but I'm not in the mood to do any of them.  I'm heading into another one of my ruts."

"event","I'm sad tonight journal, because I'm prepped to spend yet another New Year's Eve and subsequent New Year's Day alone.  I told Jesse I liked him yesterday, and he seemed okay about it. But that's how they all seem in the very beginning.  I lose at life.  I'm sick of expecting things from people.  I'm tired of always being right about people.  All I want is for someone to surprise me and like me back, that's all.  Is that too much?  Maybe.  But I think I deserve it.  I just wanted him to be different than all the other boys I have liked in the past.  It still may be too soon to tell anything definitive, but the outlook doesn't look good.
By the way, I'm back at school now and everything is the same.  The roommates haven't shown up yet, because I came here early.  It was time for me to get out of Youngstown."

Oh I had another David related dream last night.  This is starting to piss me off.  We didn't get back together or anything, we just became friends again.  Granted that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, but why do I have to keep having dreams about it.  I'm just slightly annoyed by the whole scenario.

Jesse and I have been texting back and forth for like the whole weekend, and it has been the tiniest glimmer of hope in the muck that I am walking through now.  He's really helping out his cause, in terms of me liking him.  Should I become hopeful about an ""us"" rather than just a ""he and I""?  Both cases, though, would be fantastic.  We'll see what happens.  *crosses fingers*"

"event","Sorry that haven't posted in a long time, I've been kind of anti-social lately.  I want to go back to school now.  I am sick of home and everyone else.  I think I am falling for Jesse really hardcore now, which isn't all that great of a thing.  More unrequited love for me to handle, I can't wait.  Ryan read my journal and wasn't happy w/ it and took me off of his friend list so he won't be tempted to read it again.  Eh...  I don't know what I'm supposed to d with that, but whatever.  I'm sick of boys in general.  I was having David related issues last night.  I was glad when that passed.  The less I think about him the better.  I don't even think I am mad at him anymore, but he is still on some other type stuff.  Oh well, I can't help w/ that.  I got my contacts a few days ago.  Actually they're my sister's...so they're a bit light.  My order comes in sometime this week.  Tomorrow is Christmas, and I am soo not in the spirit to celebrate anything.  I need a new cellphone.  My one noe sucks ass.  I'm rambling now, for lack of anything better to do.  Ok, I'm going to go now and pretend that my discontent for the isn't depressing me.

P.S.- Moe and I went to Perkin's this morning at like 3:45, I had pancakes and a cinnamon roll.  He's a good guy.  He makes me laugh really really hard, but guess what I don't like him in that way.  That is always a good thing."

I spent the day doing a whole lot of nothing.  I hate being bored. But I figured out how to get wireless in my room, which is exciting.  I'm in process of downloading some porn.  LOL!  Too bad I'm soo not lieing."

"event","I'm sad.  I'm not real sure why, but I know I don't feel great about myself right now.  I haven't really done anything particularly deplorable, but just the same.  Terrance wrote on my wall today.  He does that alot: come back into my life one way or another when I think about him the most.  I'm not sure how he does, but he figures it out.  I think Ryan is mad at me because I didn't return his phone call.  And I can't really blame.  I don't know what I am trying to accomplish by not talking to him.  I mean he is nice to me for the most part and the sex is amazing, but I still don't want it to go any further than that.  Does that make me screwded up?  I need to goto bed, but I'm not tired because I took a nap earlier.  Stupid me."

"event","Journal, I had a dream last night that I got back with David.  And I have no idea where that came from.  It makes me sad that he is still in my head.  I was talking to my friend Rachel about it earlier, and I have come to the conclusion that it is because I am back in walking distance of his evil.  I think the best thing for me to do right now is just not think about it.  He only depresses me.
I have not done a damn thing with myself since I have been back home and it sucks monkey balls.  I haven't been going to bed until 4:30-5:00 am and not getting up and out of bed until 2.  I haven't showered in forever and I feel really gross about that, but I haven't had any real place to go.  Maybe tomorrow will be different.
I miss Terrance, and I don't know why because we don't talk or hangout like we used to.  Which is mostly my fault.  I mean I don't really like him anymore, but it's the principle of the situation.
Hopefully, I'm going to be at the Howland tournament on Saturday judging.  It'll be good to get around speech people again.  I miss high school speech soo much.  But I am coming to love college speech as well.
I have decided that I have to change my work and study habits for Winter Quarter.  I barely made it out with the grades that I did.  All of which is because of my laziness and procrastination.  I really want to get straight A's next quarter and get on the Dean's List.  We'll see if I stick to it.  But after all of that slacking off, I now know what I can and cannot do, which is helpful.  I just need to buckle down."

I'm bored shitless.  I'm at home from school right now and I want to go back a.s.a.p.  I got drunk while I've been here though.  It was specialness in a bowl.  I am soo proud that I didn't vomit.  I had a 24 hr. crush on a boy, but it's okay now.  Boys are pretty much non-existent in my life right now.  Except I am kind of doing ""things"" with a guy at school.  This is really weird for me.  I feel bad on one level, but on another level not so much.  The funny thing is that I have no real desire to date him.  And I think the feeling is mutual.  I'm not sure how I feel about that, but when I figure it out, I'll be sure to let you know."

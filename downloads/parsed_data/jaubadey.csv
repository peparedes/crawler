but tis my life, to have lame weekends. friday, i waited and then disappeared into oblivion. saturday went shopping for a prom dress rather unsuccessfully. saturday night sat and did nothing, again. went to bed before 11 o'clock on both nights. raise your hand if you think jeanne's cool! hellz yes. 

today the plan is to write my paper.

i guess a real update first. 

i dunno. not much has happened.  i got accepted to college, i'm visitng next week to see how it is.  at this point, my decision is based upon money, which sucks a buttload, but whatev. c'est la vie. right, kiddo? right. i dunno. 

yesterday was a awesome/awful day. finally went rollerblading with emily. it was great, dare i say liberating? yeah, i'd so. it was just so nice to be GOING somewhere, ya know? and with the wind through your hair, life was good. and then we did more fun stuff, including my greatest love, Avocado.  times with emily was awesome. but then blahhh. but that's ok. i'm better. and i could not, for the life of me, sleep. i just kept THINKING and DWELLING and it was NO GOOD. HAH. so i woke up at 3 and so i wanted to listen sigur ros, because sigur ros allows me to sleep. BUT apparently, my zen only had one frickin song one it! i was so mad. so then i listened to classical music. and finally we (mozart, vivaldi, beethoven, the works, although dvorak is generally not good falling asleep music) fell asleep and woke around 8 to the craziness of my grandmother. AGH. and then i lied in bed for a good amount of time, moaning the pitfalls of being a girl.  but things are ok. YEP. so. YEAH. this is a weird entry. kind of blabbing, it reminds me of ben's drunk one. except i am SO not drunk. only drunk on CAPITAL LETTERS! LOSER = JEANNE. hellz yes. 


anywho. here's the survey-bob-thinger: 

01). Total volume of music files on my computer? 5000ish
02). The last CD I bought was: Bob Dylan --The Times They Are A-changing 
03). The last song I listened to before writing this was: leisure suite by feist
03b). Song playing right now: lonely lonely by feist
04). Songs [artists] you've been listening to lately:
x1. Bob Dylan 
x2. feist 
x3. tv on the radio
x4. travis
x5. david bowie
05). Which 5 people are you passing this baton to?
um. i5nizza, chaudhury, iamtheocean, emnorf, jill_beam"

-my room smells like burnt fabric, b/c i just burnt the edges of my ribbons 
-laura + sarah + emily + jeanne made their own pizza 
-sarah and i volunteered at the nat'l heritage museum, which was actually quite fun. despite that i felt awfully underdressed. and my arm nearly fell off by holding up trays of food. but gooooood foood. yuuumm. 
-livingston taylor sounds like phil collins. and i offered quiche to him!

<P>and to know that after this year, i probably won't see 90 percent of the senior class ever again is also kind of sad. granted, i won't miss most of these people, but to know that it's the end? well, bah. and people say we'll all stay in touch, they're all compulsive LIARS and they know it. so, then what? </P>

today i went to boston with emily! was soo good. the token guy at alewife was so cheery. it was amazing. usually they're really grumpy and mean, but no! and h&m is awesome. good stuff, man. and we walked across the frozen swan (?) pond in boston commmons. more like slided across. and we went to tons of awesome cute stores on newbury street. and this mayan store, and the little mayan woman was SO CUTE. she was soooo nice. so i had to buy a necklace from her. and we were in espresso royale cafe and i had a 'spanish latte,' a latte with condensed milk. pretty intense, man. and then the best part of the day. 

so we're walking out of the cafe, which is in the lower level of the building, and we're walking up the stairs, and emily says, ""oh the sun's setting."" and then a man, who's standing on the pavement-level, leaning against a railing and drinking coffee says, ""but the days ARE getting longer."" and it was grreat. it was so random and so weird. but perfect. 

i swear, it's much better if you're actually there. 


and i got cute shoes and a lot of other stuff. so my day is complete.

so i really need new glasses. i've been using my middle-school pair (which i updated to a more recent prescription a couple years ago), because i had lost my newest ones a couple months ago. the old pair SUCKS. the prescription is not strong enough and it is completely bent out of shape and i can't wear them out of my house. i was going to get new glasses today. but no. i searched AND searched AND searched for the prescription but couldn't find it. i did find my contact prescription, but i can't use it. darnit. so, i don't have new glasses. boring story, i know. but it's really been bothering me, so there. 


oh funny story. the other day, i stuck a penny down the back of dave-o's shirt. and both of us forgot about it for awhile and ten minutes later, lo and behold, the penny was in his shoe! my victory.

-i watched castle in the sky yesterday, and it was really cute. and also much cuter because i watched it with a 4-year-old in my lap the whole time. and he gives you a kiss or hug on command. it's great. 
-no more singing valentines? is this true? i haven't sent ANY yet!
-i'm trying to devise a plan to get an ipod. it's not working out too well. anyone want to donate 300 bucks to the jeanne fund? 
-i have ANOTHER family dinner/chinese new year thing on monday. too much! 
-i have cancelled stats mon/tues and thus, i have triple free lunch on tuesday. and long blocks! i'm so excited! three classes!


i really want to do something. will someone call me?"

"event","so you see, my lexington paper is due tomorrow.  the whole course is based around this paper. i had planned to spend the whole night at the library finishing up research and whatnot. 


but no. the snow has other ideas.

the library closed today at 4 o'clock.

this makes me extraordinarily upset. 


not to mention, i think i almost got frostbite. i was waiting for the bus until forever in my too-thin socks and crappy bakers shoes.  thus, my toes froze. and they are still tingling, two hours later. (i had my aunt pick me up, because i was getting seriously paranoid and thinking i'd have to amputate my toes.) 


i also have a cumulative test in stats on everything we've learned. this is a problem, seeing as my cumulative test average is a 70.  i'm really bad at stats. and i have a stupid psych test that was suppose to be on monday. pshh. 



on the upside, there's no astro paper (until 3rd quarter), and the spanish grammar test is on monday! thus, i will have time to write my poli thought essay! hallelujah! 

alias is on tonight. this is not so good for my finishing paper/study for tests goal. 


the snow and i, we have a love-hate relationship.  kinda like lorelai. i wish someone would build me an ice rink. i would be so happy.

I LOVE COOL WHIP. it's soo fantastic!

financial aid is the biggest pain of my life. and they're not even due until like march, but my damn father is being a bum and making me to do them now. 

i bought a bottle of nail polish from walgreens, and i was all excited because i thought it was black nail polish, and you can never find good black nail polish in drug stores. so i'm painting my nails. and it's NOT BLACK. it's clear! what the hell??? soo angry. 

and i would have liked to hang out with more people besides my sister and brother this vacation. but it's doubtful. pish posh. 

i had a dream last night that my parents, unexpectedly shipped me off to ohio to go to school.  and they didn't let me say goodbye to anyone, and i couldn't bring anything. and this town in ohio didn't have any computers or internet and i was just completely cut off from everyone. i couldn't apply to the same colleges that i was going to, and for some reason, they would only let me apply to northeastern and i really didn't want to go there. the guidance counselors in ohio sucked. and i was just dying. it was a horrible dream. really. 



117,000!!! i feel sick. 



isn't it amazing that the tsunami didn't kill any animals?"

"event","dear mr. colarusso, 
you're a cool guy. really, you are. i enjoy your anecdotes about how you used to hit on girls and then bring them to the observatory at cornell. i enjoy your visual aides that you draw on the board. i don't understand what you draw, but they sure are pretty. i also really am quite amused by your attempts to involve the class in discussions about topics we really don't care much for. and it's also pretty swell that you don't really mind when jake or manny come in 10 minutes before the block ends. but you've gotta be a tad bit nicer to your favorite student, among the few that actually laugh at your jokes. and not give her 21% tests (it was a hard test!). so, tomorrow, it would be most appreciated if you could give me a 100% on the chapter 19 test! 
thanks, 
jeanne."

"event","Tomorrow is Kassy's birthday. And my birthday is coming up too. 
I'm sort of cool with Brit again. 
I just dropped it, as I should have in the beginning, I suppose. 
Thomas Walsh was being an ####### today in Spanish class. So I put ink on his face. Craig said that I wasn't a pushover and I wondered how long it took for him to realize that.
My back hurts. And I didn't get to see Diego at school this morning.
ANd I'm really starting to dislike Kassy and Tommy's relationship. I think it's really unhealthy. It's not like they're having sex or something ""risky"", but when Kassy walked with someone else after school today, Tommy got mad at her, which is REALLY weird. And not good. When I stayed at her house one weekend, he kept her up until 4 in the morning. He was complaining at her, and if I heard her correctly she had been crying. Tell me that's not alright. I think Tommy is WAY too clingy. Kassy does need some space. Oh well, just my opinion. She denies that they have any problems whatsoever. But if she won't do anything, then maybe it's not that bad."

"event","I hate being lied to. Especially by people that I thought respected me. Brit, my darling, I thought that we were friends. But now I'm not so sure. Why would you lie to me? If you're gonna call Diego, that is fine with me, but there is absolutely NO reason for you to lie to me about it. I'm not so sure about you and your ""loyalties"". Do you really respect me? Are you really my friend? I don't understand you. It can't be a good sign when you're lying to me over something so trivial. It makes me wonder . . . ."

"event","I'm in my study period now at school. I'm really bored. I figured out how to work this computer without a mouse. I don't like the fact that I couldn't actually turn the mousekeys on. I guess it's because the main computer doesn't allow for that. Maybe they're just trying to prevent students from using the computers when the don't have mouses or mice, how in hell do you say that anyway? I have to go to Ms. Cola's class next. Oh geez, it's not gonna be very fun, but then again, when is it ever fun? Yesterday was pretty uneventful, except for me baking a cake for no reason. I didn't even eat any of it. I don't really like cake very much. My dad is already starting to have his nerves visibly frayed with my mom gone. He's scary when she's gone. He get really loud and he's easily angered. I don't like that at all. I also don't like how a person can tell which keys have been used the most on this disgusting keyboard.

OOOH!! I found out where the money for the ""No Child Left Behind"" Act-type thingie is going. It's all going to fund TV shows on PBS. That, I think, is absolutely weird. Why are they using education-intended money to put on more hours of violence-free entertainment? That doesn't teach children anything, except for the idea that all bullies are truly cowards deep down, and they don't actually want to hurt people. That, my friends, is all a big load of dog poop. Nothing in those PBS shows actually reflects the elements of real life. I'm sorry children, but Clifford the Big Red Dog doesn't actually exist. And no, little 6-year-old Billy will not be left alone by the school bully because he ignored him. If this is the kind of crap that we, (kids our age), feed our children when we have them, I don't think any of them will live through elementary school. The lucky ones will get to die on the wrong side of a gun manned by a crazed lunatic in middle school or high school. Ew. Stupid PBS. Wasting money that should be used to educate children about real life situations. It pisses me off, in case you couldn't tell."

"event","Everything has been pretty slow lately. I haven't heard about many political issues that I feel strongly about. Except for the failing quality of my high school and the other high schools in this nation. I hate the fact that Time magazine listed George Bush in their list of Top 100 Most Influential People. I also hate the fact that the person who wrote the article decided to claim [very falsely] that Bush has all of the qualities of a leader. I'm pretty damn sure that I don't want a leader who can barely understand the speech that Dick Cheney wrote for him. He's just a miserable puppet for that man. Some kid named Doug said that the government was being run by ""A dick, a bush, and a colon.""
That was very funny indeed.

Besides that, I'm sitting here at my computer eating Trix yogurt. I hate that stuff. But, I don't really feel like doing anything else. My Chemistry teacher has this way of making any food at all seem incredibly unappealing and inedible. I feel sick just thinking about eating. And yet, I eat the yogurt. Why? Oh well, I will find something else to do. Lately I have really been getting the insane urge to bake a cake and eat it. Hmm, maybe we increase my drug intake. Medicate me, Mr. Doctorman!"

"event","For my first entry in this journal, I would like to say that I am glad Terri Shaivo's poor soul has finally been laid to rest. I believed that she had undergone enough suffering, and also that it was her time to leave this world. All of the confusion surrounding her case and fate inspired me to write a living will. It basically states that I do not wish to be kept in such and artificial state of life for more than a few months of attempted resuscitation.
Another topic that really captures my attention is the funding, or lack there of, in public schools. It's very sad to walk through the hallways of my high school and see pieces of the ceiling lying on the floor. The heating in the school did not work as often as it should have during the winter. The school's floors and bathrooms are quite disgraceful, they are covered in dust and spilled beverages. Teachers' Unions also get me going. It has become nearly impossible and ridiculously expensive to fire a teacher who is lazy and irresponsible. I do beleive that the so-called No Child Left Behind Policy is not just leaving students, but entire school systems in the dust. 
Reforms should be at least somewhat evident.

My father has just informed me that the No Child Left Behind Policy is an ""unfunded mandate"". So, this means that the government is telling severely underfunded school systems to make new programs and pay for more things, without actually providing any means for them to do so.
""Typical Republican response."""

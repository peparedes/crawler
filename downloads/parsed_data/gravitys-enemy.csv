"event","There are worse things that could happen. 

Basically in order to get the property insurance, because the people I am hired by for wouldn't sign off on it, I actually had to incorporate my film company. Yeah so Girl On Top Films, this name I worked under for student films and such.... is now, legally, Girl On Top Films, LLC. Oh yay. I mean it's a good thing (limited liability when you are poor is always a cood thing), but now I need to dig up money and accountants and lawyers...on the otherhand it's pretty cool to be in college and have you're own legit company. So yeah, I'm a CEO. 

Yay stress.. I must be off work and such. 

Love,
CEO of Girl On Top Films, LLC"

I could just ask you to give me a few bucks.... but this way you get makeup too!!! <br /><br /><br />Since some of you live some ways away it's easiest for all of us if you go to<br /><br /><font color=""#ff00ff""><a href=""http://www.meetmark.com""><font size=""6"">Meet Mark!!!</font></a></font><br /><br />and place your order. When you are about to check out it will ask you for your representative's phone number, <br /><br />My Number is <font size=""6"">xxx xxx xxxx</font><br /><br />This really really means a lot to me. Not to mention it's not bad makeup and when I say cheap I really mean it, most stuff is $5-7. That's a heck of a lot cheaper than Sephora. <br /><br />And men out there, it is Valentine's Day soon... it's a reaalllllyyy easy gift! <br /><br />Please please please help me out, otherwise I'm going to have to take out another loan and that would really suck.<br /><br />If you need advice on what to get or have any questions just ask away. After all you know my number now... ;-P<br /><br />Your (Kinda Sorta) Avon Lady,<br />Lila<br /><br /><font size=""5"">THANK YOU!!!!!!</font>"

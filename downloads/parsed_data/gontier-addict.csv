Happy- my Reagan-cat didn't run away!!!!!!!!! mom said she saw him this morning. she said he was eating and he went back outside and Magic followed him and they were playing which is a rare occourance! Pissed- I am Grounded for the week cuz I ran out of dish liquid, and I asked my mom to bring me some from work, well I guess she forgot, so all we had was dish washer detergent which I can't use cuz it makes the water all slimey*eeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwww* so I threw a fit! and that is why I am grounded. Scared- a friend send me an e-mail saying that he might kill himself, and plezz not to betray his trust and tell anyone. I don't want him to do anything stupid, and I want to tell anyone cuz he is a really awsome friend and I don't want him to not trust me. He is known for cutting himself, which I find TOTALLY FUCKING STUPID! and I think people who do it are stupid and selfish! and I cry everytime I talk to him on the phone cuz I can hear him grunting from the pain! I am really, really scared that this time he will&nbsp; hurt himself worse than he ever thought. I told my mom and I am trying to get her to help me figure out something that I can do to be a good friend, and help him at the same time. well I have to go to lunch! anyone with anysuggestions on what I could do plezz coment! love TigGer!"

There was a bunch of shit about me and A.J. and the stuff we did but not in too much detail, and my mom read it all !!!!! And all the stuff about Ashley and Teddy, and about Bob buying us alcohol when we were over at Ambers' house. Well, now I'm not allowed over at Ambers house, I'm not allowed to be around A.J. while my parents are around, and that really sucks cuz we were gonna go to the movies when he got payed on Thursday. I swear that if he breaks up with me because of me mom or John I will never talk to them ever again, and I will spend weeks in my room! well I really hope we stay together for a while cuz I really do love him. even though we haven't been together that long, I really Love him!</FONT>"

OMG! </FONT><FONT size=3>me and A.J. were playing 500 with the football yesterday afternoon w/ ashley, teddy, taylore, reighan, isiah,&nbsp;jo jo, and jewls. A.J. was being a butt. He was: pushing me playfuly, steping on my pants, trying to trip me, ect. well i decided to gei him back, so i squirted him with the water gun, and threw water balloons @ him. he pretended to be mad at me, and went in to change cuz he was all wet. when he came out, he was being a but, and I kinda was being a bitch, but when am i not? newayz i wrote a note asking him if he was really mad @ me, and that i had a surprise for him either in the morning or later if he came out. well aparently he got the message, cuz he came out w/ oreo and asked what the surprise was and if he could have it now or if he had to wait till the morning to get it. i told he he could get it when we were alone, well he didn't hear me cuz teddy strolled over and decided to eavesdrop. he offered me some Bud,&nbsp;i said no, that i only drink Zima. well that started the liquor conversation. well teddy finally went away, and A.J. asked again if he could have his surprise. I said ok and pulled him to the fence. he started saying if it was something to do with getting him wet he was going to be pissed. I rapped my arms arould his neck, and told him to shut up and kiss me, and he did!!!!!! OMG! He tasted like beer, but it wasn't bad! ashley asked if i gave him his surprise, and i said yes, then she asked me if i was going to do it again, and i said maybe. maybe almost always means yes, unless it's tony, then it is always no!</FONT>"

I kinda feel bad cuz he was going out with Ashley, but before they started going out, he wanted to hook up with me, but I was kinda scared, cuz he's 18, and I'm only going to be 15. But My mom kinda knew I liked him, and that he liked me, but I didn't tell her. She said she didn't mind us being friends, but she didn't want any kind of touchy-feely shit. TOO LATE! I don't know if I should tell her cuz she wasn't sure if it was a good idea for us to go out cuz we're 3 years apart, and i don't think that is a fair way to say we shouldn't be together, cuz mom and john are 3 years apart! But whether she likes it or not, I'm still gonna go out with him! Ashley is kinda scared cuz she thinks that A.J. thinks she is a slut cuz she kissed him the first day they went out. I don't care what any1 says, I love her and I don't think she is a slut! I am really happy that A.J. likes me, and I hope we are good together!</FONT>"

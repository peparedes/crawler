"event","<small><center>wanna here about my day? in the morning i came to susehns house. :]
Like around 6 in the morning. Oh man i love watching mornings. :3 i wish i could always watch them. i walked slowly into her room and she giggled and said i was creepy. I am. <3

I realized she had summer school, and she was getting ready while i was looking at a japanese Men Magazine. :o those guys are so hot, its like they are gay, and dress better than me >:0

i think all guys should have MAN BAGS. cuz its awesome. 

dude. i remember this azn girl who was so pretty . i don't know why i just remembered her, but she was so pretty i couldn't stop looking at her. :S I mean this was at knotts when i went on a ride with PRETZEl. but she got paint on her face, it was a butterfly. :] when i think about her, i dunno, i feel happy. i like people who give off good auras ^___^

anyway, i went to see 2 movies today. i saw Simpsons for the 3rd time and transformers for the 3rd time. :]

i like cookies. and i like raman. and sushi, and i wish i could change my past. Oh no, i mean so my future would involve me still in love.

Yup. but i'm not. heh. and i feel so SINGLE, it hurts. I don't know what to do with my time anymore. i'll leave that to people around me.

i depend so much. :[ like i depended on janet. in 7th grade no matter what situation i was in she was always protecting me. And i didn't realize how safe i felt around her, or how defenseless i felt when she was gone. Damn. i screwed up didn't I ?

:] 

I miss thanh. i need to talk to him. One because i feel different with him gone, i depend on him when i feel like shit. and he makes everything better. god knows how. and because, he makes me happy. I like people who make me happy.

The moon is full tonight, i like to think when i look at the moon, who else is looking at the moon right now? in this beautiful night?


i'm confusing huh? >;]

i used to think it was bad, but now. i find my un-understandable personality interesting. 
X] crazy right.

rawr. 

<b>we can be friends in hell but until then i despise you and i probably always will."

Bada bap pada da da <3

Let me tell you. Online is a dangerous thing, don't you think. 

I was watching my anime. And it came to a part where the guy was trying to tell the girl that he loves her, and he knows that his past affects him and his previous love, but since the girl thinks he is still caught up in his past, they got into a fight. The guy tells her that she cheated on him, and he doesn't like her anymore. The girl feels betrayed, she doesn't believe him. The guy grabs her and says you don't know what betrayed is do you? You don't know how it feels like to be pushed aside and tossed away alone do you?. The anime.

I was betrayed wasn't i?

Yesterday i went to a sushi place. YUM. with my sisters. After i told them about MEEE and whats up. I felt very happy. I love family. even though i don't have a life cuz all i do is watch anime all day. and lay around sleeping like a kitten. (who by the way, study shows, can sense death :0 dun dun dun) 

everything i say. I mean it. I know it gets some angry, but they don't understand my feelings. Because what i wrote before, in my last entry, i wasn't the only one who felt like that. Nope. I knew more than just one person who felt the same way. LOTS of people. and it hurts me to say it, but its so god damn true. 

I hurt myself just saying it. 


Sushn, just one more daaay.

kathleen, i'll see you lattteeerrrr!

Anyway, I'm soooo exhausted right now. haha I'm in class, done with all my work. and well half asleep because i was only able to sleep 2 hours. I don't know what is wrong with me. Hmmmmm. i was stumbling videos and i was up watching dane cook and watching anime, and i usually feel tired and go to sleep but i didn't! i stopped my self at mid-night, went to bed . moved around for like 30 mins trying to get into a comfortable postion (failed) slept of the cold floor because everywhere else is too hot. woke up 2 hours later, got up watched anime, drank water, laid down. bored. i hear my mom  she usually watches tv i'm guessing cuz she walks in looked at me (i felt it) and walked away. And i heard her go into the kitchen and i opened one eye. and i said ""mom you can watch tv"" and she laughed at me. My body was sleeping i'm guessing but my mind could hear everything around me and i could THINK. but my eyes were closed and i couldn't move. 

So here i am on my last day of summer school, i can't waitttt!! Till around 7 or eight. i'm gonna see THE SIMPSONS MOVIE!!!!! i'm going to have lots of sugar and get all excited :]]]

susehn!!!

"event","<font size=""1"">Everything is new? haha not sure where to start. um. <br /><br />Friends birthday is coming up and i'm planning a surprise party.. yeah school .. it was stressful this last trimester. i mean, tests were overlapping themselves. i sometimes had three test for one day. Luckly i pulled through getting all A's and two A+.. yeah its good that i have good grades :D I'm pleased.<br /><br />.Anywayz, yesterday i slept over at a friends house. Her name is jennifer. I went through alot during that saturday :[ ... I think i need to pay my price soon.. anywayz. what happened was that my friend is not supposed to be here.. well her family wasn't born here and something about thier papers or whatever expired... well apperently when they went to the store and bought something.. (you know how they most of time ask for ID) well when they saw my friends dad's ID he looked at it and said ""its fake"" and called the cops on them. what a fag. i mean i usually don't&nbsp; call people that but i mean thats really jacked up.It was a peace full day to. Jennifer and i were having fun talking then all of a sudden we hear her dad yelling and sound panicky/angry and i thought, jennifer's cat must have done something. so i waited while jennifer went to go check it out.. She comes back like OMG something happened she looked sad/scared a little bit... she kept looking around.. saying oh shit... i didn't want to bother her. she seemed to be in some kind of daze, so i just looked,and i and listen.. she left the room.. came back sat next to me... the saddest face i've ever seen. i grabbed her as though she was going to fall, and she started crying. she cried so hard and alot, it surprised me a bit. but for some reason she felt small :[ helpless... so i just stroked my hand in her hair.. and all i remember from that was her saying, whispering in my ear. ""promise me that you won't let them take me away..."" and i hesitated for a bit but i promised for now... I listen to her dad, crying... getting scared... from what i understood, they had her brother in handcuffs. ( the ""officers"") and of course jennifer was crying saying ""whats happening to us?. this is the day. the day i've waited for, the reason why i've cried everynight.... day when they take everything from me"".... i wanted to help. i was in a house... everyone was crying, even me. How can one not? Her grandma actually made me cry. Because after the dad and the mom went to go talk to the ""officers"" jennifer heard her grandma crying too, trying to call someone to talk to her. I mean i don't blame her, she was scared too, and she was 80. Then jennifer told her to come in and all i heard was her crying saying in spanish "" Mi mijo, they are going to take my son away. what is happening??"" such cries, i couldn't help but cry. I mean it was one of the saddes thing i've ever experinced, seeing even her grandma in her worst state... After wards, somemore family members came over and calmed the grandma...then jennfier comes back into the room and says you hungry? and i was like err. her face made me lose my appitete but i said yes and she gave me poptarts. &lt;3 Yet we ate in silence and soon she said"" i told my friend something like this would happen. that i would come home one day, from school, and i would walk into the house and everyone/everything would be gone.""<br />.. I didn;t know what to say.. so i walked over to her. kneeled down so i can look up to her face(since it was down) and said, if anything like that was to happen, anything at all, i only ask you one thing... come run to me. Come to me and i'll be there for you. and of course she felt better. and thats what i wanted. to make her smile... and then i sat next to her until her parents came back with her brother and everything was fine. everything was ok, and jennifer and i were happy. After we heard them come into the house, jennifer said, ""when i move jasmine, i want you to keep my stuff. ""and i was shocked. but i smiled and said ""really? thank you!... ""Then i said, ""hey jennifer, you know cement, before it dries its wet and you can press it to make a mark? yes well, you just left a mark in my heart&lt;3"" and she gave me a hug. Then she said ""i'm glad you came, i don't know what i would've done without you"" and i said"" i'm glad i came too, i wouldn't want you to go through this alone."" after that, well we changed subjects but i'm glad that everything worked out.<br /><br />Sometimes life isn't fair..<br /><br />susehn i don't know how to send ...stuff.. ahaha yeah i need to talk to you later.<br /><br /><br /><br />&lt;33333</font>"

I was in 5th grade. What i did, I don't know why I did it... It wasn't like me at all yet it was. (Before i used to be mean. to everyone. BUT I didn't WANT to be mean, I just was.) anyway, I can tell from this day that i was gonna be nice in the future. The day on Fathers day. Its funny though.. WHY i did it, i'm not quite sure. I mean i didn't talk to her alot. i didn't HANG out with her in recesses. i didn't. Yet, she sad next to me and cried. She was sad and angry and was crying on Fathers day when we were making cards for our dads. I was about to ask her what was wrong when i realized she told someone that her dad was in jail and he said he never loved her or her siblings. The teacher would call "" Lets make a GREAT card for Fathers day"" and she cried even more. I still remember her crying face. I felt so bad, i just had to do something. and i did. I went up to the teacher( haha we had a sub that day but i didn't care), and whispered in his ear "" Can you keep the whole ""great fathers card"" thing down, my friend is having trouble with her father and she is very sad"" and the teacher was like alright and he avoided saying happy things about Fathers.Instead he was talking about HOW to make a card and so forth. My friend, she calmed down alittle. She stopped crying but the look on her face was still gloomy. So i decided to give her my mood ring. I'm not sure why. But I'm glad i did. I said"" Here, you can have this"" and she was very surprised and i remember she smiled after that and everything was ok now. She was happy with her mood ring and she must have forgotten about fathers day, which is what i wanted.She was happy. So was I. Her name was Genesis. The next day she was very happy and i had noticed that she put the ring into a necklace. I was happy.<br /><br />My mom was impressed when i told her. and so was my dad. But they must understand , because i know that i should be thankful that my parents haven't split up or gone to jail for doing something EXTREME. I guess Thats it. I remembered it. And I'll never forget</font>"

"event","Got to do some horse-riding last Thursday at the firm's expense on a fun day - did a little bit of trot and a bit of canter - then a nice walk in the forest.

I had hoped to go down to Janet Rogers on Saturday and ride Silver, the horse I'm riding at Waltham, but with the nearby town of Maidenhead being under-water and the threat of the roads to the south being blocked with stranded motorists, the odd life-boat and the emergency services, thought I'd give it a miss and keep out of the area.

So, in recompense, I booked a private lesson at the West Bridgford Equestrian centre in Nottingham - it was wierd - the last time I was there was winter so I was riding at night in an indoor salle - they've now built an outdoor school so I got to ride outside in the daylight - totally unnatural !
 
I had a very nice hour-long lesson tonight on a horse (sorry, forgotten his name already) who was *totally* misbehaving (and had been in the previous lesson), putting his head down suddenly and trying to snatch the reins - apparently he'd had his spine looked at earlier in the day and I think was feeling a bit sore.
 
Bloody good lesson, though - we tried a bit of trot, but as he'd stop suddenly with no warning and throw his head down, we went back to basics and just worked on the shoulder-elbow-hip-ankle posture at the walk, without stirrups, correcting my posture bit by bit, doing leg/hip stretches to get my lower leg under me, relaxing deep in the saddle even when he'd try to snatch the reins and learning to rise from the shoulders and upper legs without moving my lower legs until I could rise and sit under control without falling back - then to finish off did some rising trot (with the instructor holding a BIIG whip - he got the message) and I was rising and sitting completely relaxed and under control - I could stand up there on balance and sit deep so when he did eventually throw his head down, I didn't budge an inch as I was sat directly over his centre and was on balance.
 
So I've now got a bunch of warm-up exercises to get my seat corrected while warming up at the walk - I'm now sitting a hell of a lot deeper in the saddle and I can see how this comes in handy for cantering. I'm sore as hell as I've stretched in manners which do not come naturally to men (!), but I can't wait for Waltham !"

"event","Nice show; bit of difficulty getting back home.

Friday was nice - myself and Jo took the afternoon off and drove down to Jo's parents in Croydon and got fed and woke up only an hour's drive away from TW. Nice quiet roads, got there early and set up.

Good show - participation was on a when-you-feel-like-it basis, lots of talking to the Public and occasionally shooting combatants whenever Roj's evilness got the better of me.

Did a bit of one-on-one with Jo and some line-fights and I managed to acquit myself well, even slotting Adrian a few times when he took his eye of me for a millisecond. The rest was spent doing crafty things - Jesper's got the patterns for authenti-leather waterbottles (cuir boili or something like that) so I was sewing them up ready for the boiling stage.

The battle was fun - basically a Sheriff's Arrest Warrant scene and I got to shoot many people before getting evilly slotted myself.

Getting back was a nightmare - we left at 5:30 and go onto the M25 at J5, just in time to hear they'd been a major 13-car pileup at J3 and everyone was being turned around a J4. The trouble with motorways is there's no other exits, so you're trapped. At 9 o'clock after much swearing at queue-jumping b******ds driving up the hard shoulder with their hazards on, we finally managed to reach J4 and do a U-turn. (We did fantasise at one point that we had the means to poke those undertaking ****s with a 1-handed spear as they passed by - in lieu of having a LAW rocket - but decided there were enough stupid people on the road)

The plan was to circumnavigate the M25 the long way around and go up the M1. Just as we got near the M1 turnoff we saw the matrix signs and traffic reports saying the M1 was CLOSED at J10, due to bridge work. Oh come on, I thought, give me a fricking break ! I had to drive past to the A1 turnoff, stop for much needed lucozade, fuel and chocolate and drive up the Nottingham up the A1.

We got home at 20-to-1 in the morning, some 6-7 hours later and just went straight to bed.

Today I feel like I've got a headache behind my eyes from all that driving and staring at rear-head-lights and I feel some calorie-therapy in Sainsbury's cake section coming on for the 2 of us."

"event","HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JO !!!!

It is Jo's birthday on Sunday (today), so we went out cycling around Clumber Park, taking a picnic with us in the panniers, cycled for about 10 miles, ending with a downhill stretch where we reached dizzying speeds of 14 MPH (!), then lazed about on the picnic rug and ate sarnies and flapjacks.

I kinda lost track of the rest of the afternoon when we got back due to passing out on the bed, but woke up in time to take Jo out for a surprise birthday meal at a nice Italian restaurant in the evening.

Jo woke up to cards, coffee in bed, pain-au-chocolat and a present from me - a folding craft table for her card-making - kinda like a sawn-off ironing board.

We did the tour of out-of-town shops, got some house-hold stuff, lunch food and then attacked the gardens with a vengeance. Now, I'm pretty aggressively indifferent to gardens and I guess I may possibly have left them to overgrow just a tad too much - we couldn't get INTO the back garden - I managed by simple expedient of moving the lawn mower in, angled upwards at 45 degrees to machete its way into the undergrowth. We now have chopped back the massive budlia bush which was trying to come in the front door and mug the postman, we have a lawn now in the front rather than rye grass and an expeditionary trail blazed into the back jungle, possibly destroying species unknown to Science in the process.

I think I need to do gardening a bit more ... I was going to say ""...regularly"" but ""..at all"" sums it up more.

If anyone can recommend a napalm air-strike service with pinpoint accuracy, I'm all ears...

The forecast for tomorrow is thunderstorms, so no cycling in (boo), but I hope to cycle in during the rest of the week. 

We're driving down to the Haestingas local show this coming weekend, visiting/staying at Jo's parents in Croydon on Friday night and then leisurely bimbling down to Tunbridge Wells on Saturday morning. Just taking war-gear (bow), bowls and an appetite - should be fun.

"event","Had a 9 o'clock ride some 70 miles away this morning at Mark's Stables, near Hull, so early night last night, packed the car, set the GPS and then 0h-dark-hundred this morning - up, Boots n Saddles and hit the road.

Had a big grey (read ""white"") horse called Penny and Mark taught up a lot of stuff which I've heard before, but he was able to put it into context - such as ""keeping your heels down"", cos otherwise it's easy for a ground-pounder to chuck you out of your saddle....

Glorious sunshine, trotting around the field with Martin &amp; Clare and working on our balance - riding at the trot, standing up in the stirrups, holding onto a neck rein and having to twist our torsos (whilst standing) to be able to see over the horse's tail - the reason being so you can see who's behind you while you're riding.

Lots of stuff which contradicts what I've been taught before - such as you can slow down from rising trot to Walk without going to sitting trot - in fact the horse would prefer it ! Trotted (rising) around the school weaving in and out of cones, keeping my hands low over the withers (shoulders), my heel down and then slowed to a walk and halt still standing in the stirrups before sitting down....

3 Point plan for stopping - 1) Heels down, 2) sit back and roll your pelvis to increase your weight on it's back legs, 3) say ""Whoa"" and pull on the reins - works like a charm.

Couple of combat points I hadn't thought about before such as your feet always stay in the stirrups. These are not ponies, you're sat on a warhorse and need to be properly seated if it suddenly decides to take off.

Mounting and dismounting was different from what I've previously been taught. 1) Collect the reins in your left hand and pull all the slack out (ie Don't get on the horse and then sort out the reins) 2) foot in stirrup 3) Right hand on the far back corner of the saddle (I normally grab the pommel at the front), then get on.

Getting off -&nbsp; feet out of stirrups - both hands on the horses withers in front of the saddle (not holding the saddle), then get off.&nbsp;

We didn't get to do any weapons stuff, but we had to get these basics right as they're critical for delivering a sword or lance strike and if you don't get them right then you could be going off the horse.

We had a hour break for tea and sarnies, then back in the saddle - this time on Magic - a 17 hands chestnut horse that does bunny hops when trotting - and out for an hour's hack along the back lanes and bridle paths - you really get your rising trot, heels down and seat&nbsp;working when you're trotting in a pack along a hard earth road. By the time we got back, any rough edges in my technique had been filed down - with Magic occasionally setting into Bunny Hop Trot to catch up with the front horses - all I needed to do was sit back and settle my weight and off she went - slowing her down was the trick - you either get your seat right, or you walk back home - and then driving 70 miles back.

I'm exhausted, but it was well worth it - I learned a heck of&nbsp;a lot and the hack just validated what I've learned in the school and I just sat back and enjoyed the view without thinking too much about the riding.

I believe we're going to have an all-weekend up there at some point this year, which should be good.

Going to pass out now.

"event","Grrr.

Rode 2 horses tonight - Percy who is now called ""Nova"" - ""No go"" and Chester which I'm calling ""Daisy"" - some day's 'e trots, some day's 'e don't !

Had to retire Percy halfway through the lesson as nothing this side of a lightning bolt was going to make him trot. Chester would trot, but would go wherever he damn well fancied no matter how many teeth I pulled out and how much crop he got. Spent most of the time trying to stay on and not go over the jump in the middle of the school he fancied.

On the glass-half-full side, had to dodge 3 more DaddyBoughtMeAPony types wandering around whilst keeping a tight rein on [Insert name of nag] from suddenly deciding to spook and jump sideways, run at a post, run to his mates, paw and bite at some poles on the floor, stamp feet and generally act petulant.&nbsp; Again, good exercise in horse-control and trying to stop the horses charging the barrier and trotting of that small child. Have learned today that no manner of aids, signals or out-and-out-violence will change the mind of half a ton of horse if it decides it's actually going THIS way.

Booked in for a bit later next week, hopefully will have fewer DBMAPs around. Getting up at silly o'clock on Sunday to go to Mark's stables to do some cavalry riding with Clare &amp; Martin - should be fun.

"event","Drove straight from work (what a more civilised hour!) to the stables and on Percy. 3 other horses in the yard as it was raining (hey, didn't I pay for private lessons?!) but was cool as it was good conroi training keeping a battlefield situational awareness eye out for where they were (doing individual circles, trots and canters), undertaking them on the inside track at the trot, keeping my horse doing what I wanted to do, rather than Percy charging after the herd and ... finally ... into canter.

Percy is fantastic for canter - he was well up for it. Rising trot... transition to sitting trot going into the corner, bit of outside boot - whayhey, suddenly we're cantering around the school. Percy has a very slow canter which is great for me and gave me long enough canters to sort out maintaining my rein contact and not gripping with my legs - very much like sitting in a rocking chair - just sit back, keep contact and keep encouraging him on - I much prefer canter to trot !

Booked in same time next week and then off for Military equine training at Mark's up in Yorkshire on Sunday 11th.

Managed sitting and rising trots and some nice transitions, riding figures-of-8, diagonals, etc at the trot and astonished Steve by getting Sandy to trot several laps without stopping - which she's notorious for.

Getting a better feel for the horse - much more relaxed in the saddle - must remember to incorporate breathing into it as I keep concentrating so much on LeftLegRightReinTrotTrotKickTrotBREATHE !!!! I'm able to feel when Sandy's about to slack off the pace and give her a nudge, when she's aiming my knees at the walls - I even got some dressage side-stepping out of her and Steve let me train for a bit 1-handed to simulate Regia horsework - although just at the walk at the moment until I get the controls right.

Steve was going to move me onto a faster horse called Percy next week, but said I could continue to ride Sandy as I seemed to be getting faster paces out of her. Coool. Bless her, Sandy was absolutely chinstrapped at the end and, ironically, I got chinstrapped - literally - managed an entire hour riding without incident and on the dismount didn't get my riding body armour clear enough so it rose up and smacked me on the chin as I dismounted. Oh well.

Taking the day off tomorrow for York, looking forward to a long lie-in in the morning (cos I ain't going to get much sleep this weekend !) and drive up to York early afternoon, have a leisurely bimble around town and pick up the hall key whenever they ring me up with the details.

Not nearly as nackered as last week, although a few sore muscles so I may or may not be wearing armour at York depending on how they're doing after a good night's rest.

Had a call from my dad 10 minutes later to check I'd gotten home okay as the maniacs were slipping and sliding up and down the road.

Most of it has vanished over the weekend - indeed today was pretty balmy. Been playing Splinter Cell Chaos Theory by way of diversion, lots of sneaking around in approved ninja-style.

"event","<font size=""3"">To join in with the other deBec riders, I've booked my first riding lesson since 2003/2004. I did a google search and found a nice riding place just 5 minutes from work (probably 20 in rush hour) and have taken the plunge and booked a private lesson on Thursday at 8pm so they can assess where I'd fit in. The school runs from 9am-9pm, so I can ride during the week if I'm away at the weekend.<br /><br />I went over there to check the place out and decidedly felt like a fish out of water. Everyone there seemed female, younger and richer - the car park was chock full of daddy's BMWs and Mercs and here I drove up in my van. Phrases like ""Samantha's just bought her own pony"" - ""Well, about time too"" just underscored the fact that if we were to take everybody around me and do a bell-shaped-curve of wealth..... I'd be the blip at the far left....!<br /><br />I'm rereading Sally Swift's books on centred riding which translate martial arts principles of balance, breathing, etc into horse-riding and Monty Robert's books, but I think despite wanting to get in sync with the beastie, it's still going to tear-arse around and look to deposit me onto the sawdust at such point. Oh well. I'm hoping by 8pm, it'll be too knackered - or, just surly, grumpy and homocidal.<br /><br />I'm treating this as a learning experience. I'm a learner. The horse has a lot to teach me - even if that lesson is that there's no such thing as gravity - the earth sucks. I feel a Rincewind moment coming on ohgodohgodohgodohgodI'mgoingtodieohgodohgod. I've never done a private lesson before; normally I've been 1 of 6 riders so got to get a break for my sore ankles when I got to the back of the ride and the peer support of the rest of the deBec gang... but no.... not this time.... I'll have an hour with no let up, hot and cold running shouting from the instructor, no peer support&nbsp;and a big spotlight on me.... no pressure.<br /><br />I'm hoping once I'm back in the saddle, it'll all come back to me... I'll be trotting around, perfectly balanced and loving every second of it....(yeah right)..I&nbsp;think it would be helpful if I dumped these expectations of results at the door and just focussed on the fact that I'm there to learn and just relax. Whatever happens, happens, and good or bad, it's all building up experience in the old computer and years from now it'll just be a funny anecdote around the campfire.<br /><br />Did I mention - nervous ? I think I need a dose of Ginie's French positivity to counteract my English pessimism.</font>"

"event","Complete reversal from the last time in the dojo! <br /><br />Tonight was defences against man armed with a sword, which end with swordsman on the floor and you walking off with a nice, pretty, shiny new sword. <br /><br />I wisely just grabbed a bowl of muesli rather than something heavier before going and really threw myself into the warm up and rolling practice. My bounciness has returned ! <br /><br />Sensei Alan gave some very specific pointers which was good as I hate vague <br />- sword strikes are done not with just the arms, but the whole body moving forward - WWHUUMP ! The Japanese senseis apparently come and test your posture after a swords strike - they don't care what you've done with the sword - they push your chest and see if you fall over from not being on posture. <br />- As soon as the swordsman twitches - get in there! Don't wait for him to strike - get in !! <br />- Your upper body doesn't have to tense and rise up when defending against a lunatic swordsman. Stop thinking you're doing a martial art - let all the tension drain - it's just an exercise in moving with posture. <br /><br />Tonight, I had one of those techniques which you get once every few years where everything's right. One second Tim was striking at the top of my head with his sword - I moved thinking about posture - then next he's on the floor and there's a sword in my hand.

Sensei Al has been playing more with very bad Japanese types and obviously wanted to make us suffer too... I mean, pass on his learnings. We started off the night with a gentle straight-arm throw, moved onto an evil sankkyo wrist lock which makes your partner dance for you on tiptoes, a rotary-throw (kaitennage) which was very gentle, fluid and makes people go splat and finishing with rokkyo knife-taking techique which is designed to cheerfully pop someone's shoulder out in 1 violent rotation.

I'm so glad Sensei chose to share that with us.... I'm fine (at the moment) but no doubt will lose all ability to use my arms in a day's time.

This draws on a lot of theatrical acting techniques such as projection, vertical moments (getting centred), horizontal moments (making eye contact with the audience), empathy, etc. 7.5 hours later, whilst I feel better about my progress, I've projected my voice hoarse, shared more emotion with my fellow course-goers than I'm usually comfortable with and am generally knackered.<br /><br />God knows what state I'll be in by the end of tomorrow - it requires a hell of a lot of focussed energy, standing in a grounded posture and trying to convey energy and emotion - usually while reciting something weird.</p><p>I'm hoping to get some good stuff out of this which means I'll be able to connect with people better when giving presentations (and generally) rather than just a dry recitation of facts and figures and try to influence people more (Jedi mind-tricks are banned at work - unreasonable lot)<br /><br />God knows how actors keep up these energy levels day in, day out - I have a hell of a lot more respect for actors'&nbsp;abilities now.

It was a bit pants at first (a lot of it my fault), but we eventually managed to get the&nbsp;wrinkles ironed out. The addition of the squad system we used on Sunday (3 squishies attached to a noble) seemed to work very well and allowed local command when comms went down.<br /><br />I was also very impressed with&nbsp;Count Guy's&nbsp;command style which had less to do with shouting at people and more about their morale - especially when idiot commanders came up and shouted at them.... I have taken notes...<br /><br />The event was marred for me by the [expletive deleted]s on the Saxon right flank who took it on them to hack the ends off our Novice's spears in the final clash, but that didn't take too much of the shine off the weekend for me.<br /><br />We managed to cheaply and easily(ish) feed 24 people for a fiver.

On Wednesday, I put my car in for it's MOT (it's nearly 3 years old) plus its 36k servicing to find out that I needed 2 new tires (1 had some wire wrapped around it, puncturing it), the rear brake compensator had seized (whatever that is), front suspension had a lot of play in it... the list went on, adding to a hefty bill and a need to find a lift home from work.<br /><br />Thursday I thought went well, until I had some feedback from a fellow manager that I had p****d-off a whole bunch of people in a disaster scenario exercise by pointing out all the flaws in their plan. We had a frank and hearty exchange of opinions/feedback which left us both feeling crap. I then was late for getting on the tram to pick up my car, couldn't jog the first mile from the tram stop due to a lot of police in the area dealing with some incident (a running man would attract a lot of unwanted attention) and had to run the last mile to get there in time.<br /><br />I had to grin at the reams of garage printout including the line where they claimed they ""fried"" the brake compensator (they meant ""freed"" - I hope)<br /><br />Didn't get much sleep overnight mentally reviewing the verbal exchange, but sorted out the personality clash by dragging my fellow manager into a room to continue our conversation in a more positive vein. We have a difference of styles - I need to employ more of a Star Trek mindset - different laws on different planets. Drove down to Canterbury that night with much caffeine and frequent stops.<br /><br />The Saturday deBec AGM was very productive and good natured&nbsp;and I really enjoyed going into town with everyone afterwards to eat at Nandos and generally talk rubbish in the pub afterwards.<br /><br />At Sunday's battle practice, I took out my frustrations from the week on everyone and went on a bit of a killing spree - which was nice.

It has an integral coif and looks cool - fortunately I've got some sheets of mail I made earlier for some random project - I think it might have been chainmail leggings - which I can use to widen it and put arms on. Kit-specs permitting, I'm hoping to wear it for Hastings, although I'm going to have to acclimatise to it as it's a wee bit heavier than my byrnie.<br /><br />Not sure exactly what timelines you can use different mail shirts in - when aventails and integral coifs came in, etc.<br /><br />Cleaned the car so I can see outside rather than using the Force and put Rainex on the windshield which is really funny stuff as rain can't grip the windscreen and just slides off in beads without the need for windscreen wipers.</p>
<p>Jo and I planned our meals for this week and shopped accordingly - it's all very healthy but we have far more fruit than reason.

"event","Myself and&nbsp;<span class=""ljuser""><img style=""VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom"" height=""17"" alt="""" width=""17"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" />Pogglemad</span> have set ourselves goals of doing 1 activity per week to get out of the house - last week it was seeing Pirates of the Caribbean II. Jolly good rollercoaster of a movie and like roller-coasters, exciting, with twists and turns, sudden unexplained flat bits followed by jaw dropping adrenaline rushes, that strange stop, stop, stop bit at the end when you're not sure if it's finished or not... and a desire to go again and see the next bit. Basically a prelude to the 3rd film, but with little control over the slow/fast pace and wandering direction. <br /><br />Been working on my authenti-sundial project (well, surfing, more like it) and sent that off to Regia to get their OK to try it out at Detling.&nbsp; I love the thought of out-authenti'ing Regia....<br /><br />Also attacked the back-garden - mostly having to fight my way in by uprooting nettles which have grown to gigantic proportions and compact-filled a wheelie bin with nettles which were taller than me. Perhaps I need to do gardening more often..... nah ! <br /><br />Aside from that I've been watching Airwolf season 1 - a blast from my teenage years - and playing Commanche 4 and giggling at poor unsuspecting Russian hardware on the horison which were about to recieve an armour-piercing surprise... Having said that, the latest mission involves trying to sneak past the Russian airforce and I'm getting creamed - I want an Airwolf !<br /><br />Mark"

"event","<p>The next few months are going to be very manic - Detling, AGM, Freshers, Hastings, Wychurst, etc. Not sure where or how often myself and Jo will be able to stay down in Thanet during our visits either.<br /><br />Work's pretty stressful, although we did get taken out for a half-day fun event - I spent mine bombing around on a bicycle around the Sherwood forest trails, keeping up with the uber-fit folk and fish-tailing down slippery hills at breakneck speed. Went through a ford which had slippery algae on the stones - thank heavens we slowed down and went through at snails pace. Great fun, involving following trail markers, map reading and just ignoring the sheer insanity of high speed on rough terrain. Forgotten just how much distance you can easily cover on a bike - almost makes me want to cycle to work each day - apart from the psychotic drivers and lack of cycle lanes.<br /><br />Obviously, my legs hurt like a git last night after all that and I was basically zombified all evening so didn't go to aikido - need to stop doing things which prevent me from going, I haven't been in weeks ! It used to be that the only reason you didn't get your ass in the dojo was because the iron-lung wouldn't fit through the door....<br /><br />Lots of audit-type prep work filling my day, although I'm taking a grip of my team and have prepared and led some surprisingly productive feedback sessions which I thought they might take as b******ings, but ended up with better working relationships on the far end so I'm feeling happier for getting through some tough conversations with a positive outcome. (Wish I could keep this up when I come home - might stop me posting some ranting postings to my friends !)</p>
<p>Off to Waltham Abbey, Royal Gunpowder Mills this weekend - a site which doesn't allow ground campfires due to the cordite in the ground - cool ! Then nothing for a month then Detling, last Regia show of the season. Then AGM, Freshers, Hastings.........kill me now. Thank god I've got good people around me !<br /><br />Took <span class=""ljuser""><img style=""VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom"" height=""17"" alt="""" width=""17"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" />pogglemad</span> out for a nice Italian meal for her 25th b-day on Saturday - kept it a big surprise until Saturday. Still got loads of cake to finish off if anyone's hungry.... (nope, sorry, Jo just said it's hers - apart from the coffee-flavoured chocolates)<br /><br />Mark</p>"

"event","<p>Feeling much better just in time for the departmental fun day out at Carsington Water. Spent a chilled out morning playing boules followed by an 8 mile mountain bike cycle around the reservoir. Most of the dept decided to cycle on the flat bits and turn back at half-time, but the rest of us when on&nbsp;a mission to get around the reservoir in the hour available.<br /><br />I managed to keep up with the front 2 team-mates by virtue of the fact that they stopped to let my poor, wheezing frame pushing the bike up the nastier hills catch up with them, but it was a really good workout and the final downhill sections, freewheeling up the hills from the downhill impetus were great.<br /><br />Lots of gravel on the trail, so downhill was done with back brakes as they suddenly went through hairpin bends, usually to go up another hill.<br /><br />Damn, I need to be fitter, but for someone who hasn't ridden a bike in over a decade, I managed to do well to keep up and the after-event meal in the pub felt well and truly earned afterwards.<br /><br />Mark</p>"

"event","After a good Wednesday night in the dojo, woke up on Thursday unable to speak - massive throat infection which was giving me a painful ear.

Went to the docs who were no use - their diagnosis went ""yes, your ear's going to be painful because your throat is sore""... and that was it - nothing about how to get rid of the sore throat ! Fortunately, found lots of Beechams to take care of it.&nbsp;

Came home Thursday afternoon unwell and slept through most of Friday. I have been mostly spending this weekend unconscious ! Drank beechams at 3hr intervals and eventually got better.

Not looking forward to work tomorrow - will have to catch up on whatever got missed on Friday due to my absense and try to keep functional for an entire day rather than just napping at very inconvenient mome-"

"event","<p>Good tip from Sensei Al when we were inhaling our drinks after a sweat-box-like 2-hour session in the dojo. When you're tired, irritable, knackered, etc, etc, you'll probably find you're primarily using just 1 sense - usually sight.<br /><br />Take a second. Listen. What can you hear? (the barlady counting change out) What else ? Smell - what can you smell (ok, in our case, ""wet dogs""). What are you feeling ? How does the space around you feel. Taste - damn, but that diet coke I was inhaling tasted good.<br /><br />Extend your use of your senses, especially your awareness of the space around you, between the tables in the bar, the space between the ground and the submerged X-wing (oh, hang on...).&nbsp;<br /><br />Makes a big difference switching channels to experience life when all seems very dull and flat - you've probably shut down most of your senses (I can see the reasoning for smell shutting down in sheer self-defence)<br /><br />Aikido was very good tonight, attack from a grab, draw your elbow to your body, turn your hips sideways slightly and shunt the chap off to the side and down where he ends up contemplating his proximity to the ground whilst you're calmly standing up and explaining the error of his ways to him and the karmic damage he's doing to himself - or, you know, just ninja'ing him into the floor - whatever. Nice controlling move, deflection of a full-tilt attack from the front straight into a pin where you can dump him and take on the next chap.<br /><br />Of course we all tried to do ninja moves like throwing him, elbows anywhere but to our sides, but once we'd settled down and treated it like an exercise in movement, they very obligingly went splat in a harmonious manner.<br /><br />I must be getting old, I had to stop at one point to get my breath back in the middle of a 2-hour, sweatbox martial arts marathon, but I damn well threw myself full-tilt into every technique, went flying across the dojo, bouncing back up in posture, kneeling in seiza during the demonstrations practicing my posture and breathing (and praying my heartbeat would slow down) whilst everyone else lolled around. I've still got game.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm pretty good - a strained friendship has been patched which has made me a much happier bunny. Life's too damn short to waste friendships.</p>

"event","Small show and some wic kit couldn't arrive due to illness, but we rose to the occasion.<br /><br />No firewood provided by the client - so we went foraging and brought back a load of deadwood.<br /><br />No 2nd tripod, 2nd cauldron, wic boxes or tables, so we managed to borrow from Roger of Hastingas. Everybody knew exactly what needed doing on the wic so looked for things that needed doing and just did them. No ordering people around just very chilled out.<br /><br />Did 2 cooked breakfasts, a cold meat/cheese lunch and an evening meal of Pork in Cider, veggie stew and pears in red wine - all very tasty.<br /><br />Very hot - must, must remember to pack my hood for shows as I'm very sunburnt on my neck. Everyone got dehydrated despite us buying copious amounts of orange juice, applejuice and salted crisps.<br /><br />Did lots of archery, was on top of my game as I kept hitting what I was aiming at, but sadly no combat archery due to very small arena. Got to play the leader of the Saxon men (it was basically deBec vs) taking over his new lands from King Edward, only to find the previous Cnut-appointed incumbent still there (Ben).<br /><br />We got utterly mullered in such a small arena with short arms vs a lot of spears and my boy <span class=""ljuser""><img style=""VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom"" height=""17"" alt="""" width=""17"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" />Rufas</span> fought with the banner in 1 hand and his lang in the other to the last man. They dragged me over to Ben who talked a lot about killing me but sillyly took his eyes of me whilst posturing. They hadn't searched me for weapons and I know this little Japanese technique of striking from drawing a sword, so his speech ended abruptly with ""Shall we kill him? Shall we --aaaaargh"" as I gutted him before being jobbed by the rest of his men.... hee hee...<br /><br />Very tiring, but we still rock in terms of numbers,&nbsp;logistics&nbsp;and kit on the field.<br /><br />Mark"

"event","... had a good night in the dojo doing defences against 2-handed grab to the collar. Having been extremely peevish in the last few training sessions, I remembered that there's always something new to learn, you're not expected to get everything perfect and there is no goal to achieve... there's just turning up, training and polishing the techniques. Switch to learner mode (recieve-only) and you feel far less frustration that you're not actually a death-ninja and there are bigger fish out there than you.

Maybe sometimes that means you explore all the millions of ways there are to NOT do the technique, but it all sinks into the mental computer and eventually whittles it down to the ways that do work. Some of the techniques resonated with me - they were blasts from my past when I started learning aikido all those years ago, but with a slightly different twist.

Got a good solid lamp in the jaw - chap asked me to attack him with a bokken with a good solid strike to the head, so I did a full, committed, betternotbetheredude attack and he did a fully committed defence which involved stepping inside the strike and striking my jaw.

Lots of evil, dormant subroutines came alive - took the sword off the attacker, threw him and swept the sword in a followup move to strike him as he came up off the mat. Sensei Alan says that's what he's been taught by the Japanese and, strangely, it was what I was taught back in the old days of Sensei Doc Price, the one man I know who I could have dropped on a 16thC Japanese battlefield with a sword and expected him to be the only one left standing at the end... Scary man.

"event","... had a crap night.. attacks grabbing both hands from behind... couldn't get the initial control... couldn't find it with a road map.. didn't even know what I was looking for....

Whilst I can force a technique with brute force and biomechanical leverage, that's not what I'm looking for. The end bit where you get to do some ninja move involving arms bending the wrong way is very gratifying (and they make a nice splat sound), but if you don't have the control on from second 1, you don't get to live to see second 2. Forcing it on and telling yourself, ah, but that's ""street aikido"" is just another way of rationalising the fact that you don't understand it and you're more interested in boosting your ego than learning something.

So pretty much not a single technique working all night. That's pretty disheartening, I have got to say. Without any ego, if I walked into any other aikido dojo, I'd be throwing people around all night - which while gratifying - is more because they train to fall over, to blend with the tori. Don't get me wrong, that's good also - there's no right or wrong Way, but it's not where I want to be at the moment. I'd rather take this harder path.

Sensei Alan summed up the class by getting me out into the middle of the dojo and getting me to try rotary-throw (kaitenage) and my uke swung under it and thumped me. Then Sensei did the same technique but from an initial pin (ikkyo) start which moves the uke around you, not the other way around. This is a standard technique taught across the world (I've seen it in many dojos and books in my travels) and there's this gap in the middle where you can get thumped if you have a bloody-minded opponent (I'm sure any muggers out there are sportsman-like pugalists though - not). 

There's a lot to learn, but if it's all the same to you, I'd like to get more that 1 instance of 1 technique working all night! I'm sure in another 20 years these techniques might start to look somewhere decent.....

"event","Had a relaxed Saturday - played far too much Star Wars Jedi Academy - unfortunately, I've started reading the Rogue Squadron books and that created an itch to use a lightsabre...<br /><br />Sunday <span class=""ljuser""><img style=""VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom"" height=""17"" alt="""" width=""17"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" />Pogglemad</span> and I drove over to Ilkeston which is 10 miles away for a local Regia show. Lots of St.Georges Day activities with the Army recruiting, a very dinky tank parked up, bouncy castles and lots of kids in jubbly stringmail. We had no arena stakes so we improved with rope and chairs and wandered over to bash each other when bored, in between getting fed copious amounts of bread and water (alas, not enough water). Did a lot of sword-on-sword with Jo (who passed her Battle-field-safe) and watched a Battle of Champions between Nathan and Cristian which ended when Cristian tried to shield-barge Nathan and bounced off....<br /><br />Glad to see the new Sharpe episode - looking forward to part 2 tonight. We're both in the wars with various bruises and dehydration, but it was a good intensive amount of violence, so I'm spending most of today rehydrating and telling myself I'm not too old for this ****.<br /><br />Mark"

"event","Dear Tyson chicken, 

I just ate one your chicken wings. Instead of being greasy and fatty, it was greasy, fatty AND raw. Why would your instructions tell me to cook the chicken for 15-20 minutes, if it wasn't pre-cooked. I guess you forgot to pre-cook that one. Well, guess what? I knew it was raw and I ate it anyway. Because I hate the name Tyson. Once the Salmonella kicks in, I'm going to use my winnings to pay you to rename your company ""Salmonella bites"". Because I hate the name Tyson, and Salmonella Bites sounds more accurate.

I hate you."

the greatest mystery the universe offers is not life but Size. size encompasses life, and the tower encompasses size. the child, who is most at home with wonder, says:daddy, what is above the sky?
and the father says:the darkness of space
the child:what is beyond space?
the father: the galaxy
the child: beyond the galaxy?
the father: another galaxies
the child: beyond other galaxies?
the father: no one knows

you see? size defeats us. for the fish, the lake in which he lives is the universe. what does the fish think when he is jerked up by the mouth through the silver limits of existence and into a new universe where the air drowns him and the light is blue madness? where hugh bipeds with no gills stuff it into a suffocating box and cover it with wet weeds to die?

or one might take the point of a pencil and magnify it. one reaches the point where a stunning realization strikes home: the pencil point is not solid; it is composed of atoms which whirl and revolve like a trillion demon planets. what seems solid to us is actually only a loose net held together by gravitation. shrunk, to the correct size the distances between these atoms might become leagues, gulfs, eons. the atoms themselves are composed of nuclei and revolving protons and electrons. one may step down further to subatomic particles. and then to what? tachyons? nothing? of course not. everything in the universe denies nothing; to suggest conclusions to things is one impossibility. 

if you fell outward to the limit of the universe, would you find a a board fence and signs reading DEAD END? no. you might find  something hard and rounded, as the chick must see the egg from inside. and if you should peck through the shell, what great and torrential light might shine through your hole at the end of space? might you look through and discover our entire universe is but part of one atom on a blade of grass?might you be forced to think by burning a twig you incinerate but to an infinity of them?

perhaps you saw what place our universe plays in the scheme of things-as an atom on a blade of grass. could it be that everything we can percieve, from the infinitesimal virus to the distant horsehead nebula, is contained in one blade of grass....a blade that can be existed for only a day or two in an alien time-flow?

hopefully you really took that in. moving? no. maybe. yes."

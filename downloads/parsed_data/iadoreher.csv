So, being honest, I tell her, ""No, mom, I didn't.""  She calls me a liar and says, ""Why don't you want to talk to me about this stuff?"" and I said, ""Mom, it's <i>my</i> personal business.  I don't share it with anyone, even if things <i>do</i> happen and in this situation, nothing happened.""  What the fuck?

"event","<center>As we made our way back from where you were staying that night, I knew I wanted this moment to last forever.  The night sky was a deep blue, and I would have confused it for black if it hadn't been for the glistening stars above that reflected perfectly in your eyes.  It was cold.  Even my thermal socks couldn't keep me warm.  Your friends sat in the back seat.  One asleep, the other just quiet, enjoying this moment also, but not the same way I knew we were.  I was afraid you didn't want to be affectionate in front of your friends.  You always were a shy person in my eyes.  

I felt a sudden burst of warmth.  There was your hand, on top of mine, gently grazing your fingertips across my hand and along my thigh.  I no longer felt cold.  I wanted to hold you in my arms right then, more than ever before.  Everything went out of focus.  I felt like the world was watching us, holding their breaths, as if you would do in a love scene, waiting for that passionate kiss that you always wanted to share with the person you love the most.  I almost felt like I was part of the audience.  I exhailed deeply.  This felt too good to be true, but it was.  It was all true.  No lies, no masks, no fake words.  My mouth couldn't speak for itself and I swore that my chest would open up and my heart would beat loudly, humming your name in it's rythm. Telling me with every heartbeat to say those words.  The three words that contained the most emotion, most meaning.  I was paralyzed in this state of euphoria and the beauty the moment contained.  

Back to reality.  This was reality.  Things came back into focus. I could hear the stereo.  I softly whispered the lyrics to the song playing, while you carefully drove us into the night.  It felt like nothing could stop us, and that our passion for each other could make us slowly drift away into the night sky, promising us perfection and unobtainable bliss.  This was the night I knew how much I loved you. This was the night I knew I wanted you the most. I didn't tell you this, but I'm telling you now: I love you.

And after the gallon challenge.


Last night was oodles of fun! 

Jeremy, Hanson, and Yeti came and picked me up.  We went to Coco's and went to the Duplex.  We ate the food, and Druugs came by.  So did Matt, Neil, Lani, Darren, Clint, Adam, Sam, and lots lots more.  We had a ""Milk Shake Yo Ass Party"" even though no one was really shaking their asses.  Druugs and Hanson were trying to drink a gallon of milkshakes.  They didn't make it.

Yeti and Adam did the Gallon Challenge.  A gallon of milk in an hour.  Neither one made it and Yeti puked lots.

It was time for Park in the Dark.  Dan, Mikey, Jeremy, Druugs, Sam, Matt, Neil and I all went.  It was so cold but we had SO much fun.  They spun me around on the tire swing and I almost puked. They wanted it on camera.

I pooped out early due to a sore back.  And here I am now, listening to Jeremy play his guitar.  Last night was wonderful.  Things seem to be getting much much better.

All I have been doing is spending time with the boys at the Plex, making them food, playing video games, laughing, getting wedgies, beat up on (it's all love), pepsi challenge, and so much more.

"event","Just got back from Europe on Thursday.
I'm way behind on everything.

Europe:
amazing.
France = worst
Switzerland = best
Switzerland was beautiful.&nbsp; I can't even describe it, and the pictures don't do it justice.&nbsp; It's wonderful; I'm going back.

I have all the pics on Facebook.

:)

summer is almost over :("

"event","i'm so stressed.

college:&nbsp; stupid.&nbsp; I think I'll just end up going to State.&nbsp; &amp; I'm totally okay with that. State is a good school :)&nbsp; I don't think I'll go to UNCW because I'll just be too far away from Kati.&nbsp; I'm sorry. She's my backbone and helps me everyday.&nbsp; It also depends on the situation with me &amp; Michael.&nbsp; I'm totally clueless right now.&nbsp; I know he's been busy with college applications, but cmon.&nbsp; if you have time to get on facebook and comment on other people's profiles, why not mine?&nbsp; I just want to know that you care sometimes.&nbsp; We don't have to talk on the phone for hours, just a little text message or something will do.&nbsp; You're totally leaving me hanging.&nbsp; But I still love him; I've been working much harder to learn how to deal with those stiuations that really stress me out.&nbsp; I'm more mellow now.&nbsp; He probably doesn't think so, but I do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

AND.&nbsp; Ok so it might not seem like it but, Kelly has zero self esteem.&nbsp; I don't believe in myself. ever.&nbsp; I don't think I'm pretty, skinny, successfull, smart, funny, I'm none of that.&nbsp; I feel like I'm never going to be good enough for you.&nbsp; You've never told me that I wasn't any of those things, but I just feel that I'm not up to your standards. sorry.&nbsp; And no one seems to like my hair.&nbsp; I still hear comments about it every day.&nbsp; It's my hair, I needed a change.&nbsp; I like it; I think it makes me look older. I'm tired of being a little girl.

I've been finding out lately who I really am.&nbsp; I'm not an outgoing person.&nbsp;I don't like the akwardness of meeting new people, but I do like making new friends after the weird part is over.&nbsp; I hate being a leader even though I'm forced into that situation sometimes.&nbsp; I know that I have about 3 friends that will watch my back no matter what and are always there to make my day brighter and are always genuinely concered about me.&nbsp; I've been getting a lot closer to my parents recently.&nbsp; I'm really going to miss them next year.&nbsp; That's another reason I would like to go to State, to be closer to them.

I'm really excited about Europe.&nbsp; I couldn't be going with a better group of people. I absolutly adore Hoyle, Byrd, and Ange.&nbsp; I love prom committee.&nbsp; The fashion show is the 26th and I'm wearing a gorgeous dress.&nbsp; SIZE 2 I might add!&nbsp; I've been learning to eat healthier and stuff...now I just need to get the exercise part down.



&lt;3 i miss my bff."

"event","Wow yeah so today was fun.  We didn't do much but yeah it doesnt take much for me and Britt to have fun.  Ohh yeah after school we decided to walk into the middle school to see if the note we had left on a board was still there and I saw this kid.  he was black.  okay and so yeah he had this watch on and it was on of those spinners. and so yeah i was curious and i went up to him and started spinning it.  what a cheap piece of shit.  but yeah i asked him if he got it out of the 50 cent machine cuz it sounded like plastic but he said no its real.  i made fun of him for about 56 hours after that.  i guess you had to be there cuz it was really funny.  then we saw ej.  then we went back to my house.  but yesterday when were walking back to my house we found this soccer net like one of the big real ones. and we decided to climb it.  it was so crazy we got to like the top but then we got stuck in the net so we were like hanging by our feet.  well sort of.  anyways so yeah today at around 4 Wassim picked me and Britt up and then he went to cash his check so he could buy me and Britt food.  So yeah then we went and picked Craig up and I dont know we just drove around.  NOOO omg it was so funny. Wassim was ordering our food and I dont know nevermind. I cant explain it but me and Britt seriously were almost pissing our pants.  And at the bank too.  But yeah and then that supposely ""haunted"" house off of Van Vleet.  We went there.  And Wassim was really scared.  So me and Craig wanted to go inside and so Britt decided to go too.  Well we walked up to the shed or something and we saw a rope hanging like what people hang themselves with..whats that called? yeah so Britt went back to the car and me and Craig and walked around and went inside and yeah it was odd, but gay.  There isnt even an actuall house.  

Okay so yeah back at my house.  Once again we almost pissed our pants.  We were throwing magazines at my fan.  And I swear to god it was by far the funniest thing I have ever seen.  We were doing it for about 15 minutes and in those 15 minutes it ended up destroying my room.  The magazines knocked over my speakers and clock and pictures and other things.  Yeah there were alot of other funny things but I dont remeber.

Oh yeah, I officially broke my phone.  It like well I was talking to Ryan on the phone and it like shut itself off and then turned back on again.  And he called me back and the ring got like all jacked up.  It was funny.  But not anymore because it wont turn on.  I dont know what Im gonna do cuz I might be screwed out of a phone until Christmas time.

Anyways. I LOVE RYAN BAKER.

"event","Well around 6 45 last night Tyler picked me up once again.  It was a little different this time though.  Nate Ray and Craig were all in the back.  And Whitney was already up front.  That was just a bit uncomfortable.  Dude it was crazy.  We had to be back at Tylers by 7 and it was like 6 44, so yeah he was goin like I think 70 threw his neighborhood..and running every stop sign.  It was fun.  As soon as we stepped out of the car his mom pulled in and then like a minute later Ray's mom pulled in.  So yeah, then we all went to Britts and some people were already there and then Wassim and Sarah and her boyfriend showed up so that was fun.  The movie was gay as hell though.  Well it was fun out in the lobby w.Ray Tyler and Whit before it started.  Once again me and Tyler decided we wanted to fight - right in the middle of everywhere.  But then we walked in there and there was like 20 of us and we were seriously like the only white ones.  It was crazy.  About 15 minutes into the movie me Tyler and Whit decided we couldnt take it anymore so we went outside.  I was tryin to get a hold of Ryan so he could come get us so in the meantime I was talkin to Vince on the phone and I turn around and Whitneys on the ground up against the door.  She had like passed out so I gave her my drink and sweater and ran inside to get Wassim.  We left because she said she need some cheese and orange juice.  So we ran up to Kroger and me and Tyler bought her what she needed.  She started to get better but we just stayed in the car instead of goin back into the movie.  Anyways we all went back to Britt's for a while but then Whit and the guys had to leave.  At   3 30 though Tyler was gonna go pick em back up and come back to Britts but then he didnt wake up soo yeah.  We decided to play Monopoly with Britts Moms friend Matt.  He was cool.


So yeah today me and Britt made cookies, and I decided I was taking her out to a candle-lit dinner then a movie next weekend. Lol. Yeah."

Last night Tyler picked me up around 9 then we spent an hour looking for Ashley's place.  We got so fucking lost out in like the booneys.  But then this fucking big ass bird hit us.  It was crazy it was like a bald eagle or somethin.  Hmm, yeah and once we did find Ashleys no one was there.  So that was gay.  So drove around and stopped and saw Joel, and then we stopped and I played some bastket ball w.Ray, Jared, and Eric.  I suck.  Then, I don't remember.  I got home a little before 1 and then just went to bed.  It was fun I guess.  Better then staying at home.  I think today I am going to Britt's then later a bunch of us are going to the movies then back to her house.  Hopefully I can stay the night. : /  

Anyways..

Last night was fun.  Eric's parents were gone for the night so me Carol, Tiff, Katie, Cal, Cope, and Baumchen stayed the night there.  Wassim was there for a while too.  We drank and umm yeah.  Lets just say I had a f i r s t last night.Then this morning Wassim stopped back by and took me and Tiff up to Mcdonalds.  Wow. Crazy ass driver.  - Oh fuck. Yeah okay so last night Carol's mom two-ways her & was like Brianna's mom just called looking for her and I just hung up on her you have to get back home now.  So me and Carol ran our drunk asses back to her house at 1 in the morning.  But as we were turning the corner to her house my mom pulled in her driveway.  We were fuckin smooth though.  We told her we were at Jareds watchin a movie and all this bullshit.  & she believed it.  She wanted me to call my dad though so she was like handin me the phone & I didn't want her to smell me so I was like all strecthin out to grab the phone.  But then yeah she was like okay well heres 20 dollars and just left.  It was nice.

Ohh yeah, I got my homecoming dress.  I like it a lot.  BUT.. no date : /"

"event","This really sucks. I just got ungrounded and I have to go back to school.  I guess I'm not really that mad about the actually being in school part; but I guess the part where I'm going to have to get up fuckin 5:30 again every morning.  

I've got to still go and pick some things up for school today.  And hopefully I will pick up my film from like 2 months ago.  So yeah, if I do I will try to put some of the pictures in here if I have time.  Hopefully.  Then tonight I am supposed to be putting hot pink on my ends.  But now I don't know if I want to.  I might wait till next weekend.

"event","Wow.  I'm tired as hell.  We got back from Cedar Point at about mid-night last night, but it was definitley worth it.  First thing we rode was the Dragster.  That was awesome.  It was crazy though when we were standing in like we saw Nick.  Then later that day we saw him when it was gettin ready to take off again. 

But yeah, getting hair and bangs cut again for the second time this week.  & Colored for the third time. ..Oh well.

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#green>Funny</FONT></STRONG> story :</P>
<P>We walked up town (in Fenton) and we saw this cart.&nbsp; I got in the seat where the babysits, and she pushed me.&nbsp; We did this for about a mile around in that area.&nbsp; We have a picture, its hilarious!&nbsp; We recieved a few looks, some laughs, but most of all another memory with a cart.&nbsp; Wow do we have alot.</P>
<P>Then in Wal-Mart, there were these pretzles, but they said rods.&nbsp; So I started yellling ""Hey, suck on my rod! It's salty""&nbsp; Well we found it quite amuzing.&nbsp; But then again, it doesn't take much to amuze/amuse (which one is it?) us. : )</P>

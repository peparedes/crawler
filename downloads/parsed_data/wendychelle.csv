*Wear more cute underwear.
*No more puking from drinking.
*To read Anna Karenena, Dr. Zhivago, and Love in the Time of Cholera."

Boston was awesome. I LOVED it. I didn't like Cambridge, which is where Harvard is. It was creepy Hobo-ville. There were people singing in the streets for money. Wow. Also, the accent up there is INSANE. Even the women talk like crazies, and they talk really loud. It's hard to get used to. I hated Syracuse, much to the chagrin of my father (he's from there). They did have an insanely massive mall though. I bought three really cute tops from Guess, so now I'm ready to hit up the bars.

Speaking of bars... I started my bartending class this week. It's SO much fun. We don't use actual alcohol, but we're learning to make all sorts of fun drinks and Thursday we learned how Bourbon is made and all about the different kinds of whiskey. I'll be an educated consumer when I get back to school."

1. Well, actually this was yesterday, but Katrin and I saw them again today so it totally counts. J West and I saw French Mormons. The gospel is spreading. Hide your doorbells. 

2. Katrin and I were sitting on benches at Jean Jeaures eating our Mozarella paninis and I'm gobbling up a huge gob of melty cheese when who walks by but the spanish kid I've had a crush on all f'ing semester and I've got a stream of cheese hanging out of my mouth! He laughed at me and did this head nod thing. Damnnation.

3. I called my dad and asked him to call and check my voice mail and gave him the code and everything. We hang up and a couple of minutes later my phone rings. My dad accidently called France trying to call my cell phone. 

4. I just tried to call my peer group at 10:20pm our time, and I got yelled at like a rebellious teenager. I said, ""Good evening. May I speak to Jennifer?"" in french, and she replied, ""Not at this hour! It's 10:20."" I didn't know what to do since that hasn't happened to me in oh... 5 years, so I mumbled goodbye and hung up looking really confused."

Last night I had a dream that Michael was dating Penelope Cruz and then today my ex, Aaron, had some creepy cryptic away message about hurting people but especially his current girlfriend Rachel... so I don't know what's going on. So to make myself feel a little less bleh and out of the loop I wore my Gucci sunglasses to the bank. Yay for label therapy.

This weekend was so much fun. Paris was cool (as usual), but it's not hitting me that I'm leaving, so it never quite hit me that that was my last time in Paris this trip. Weird. EuroDisney was the shit. The only bad part was space mountain. I think we rode, but I can't quite remember... I think the brain damage I got erased that memory. 

I packed on Sunday and yesterday I started cleaning. We're not talking tidying up... we're talking Cinderella-esque hands and knees washing the floors with a sponge and such. I really want to get this deposit back (it's like 300 american dollars). I also think it's been theraputic for my weird ass mood I've been in. 

Katrin is moving in tonight and she leaves tomorrow morning. Tomorrow I have to go close my bank account and finish cleaning and then Thursday it's buh bye Tours. Jamie is taking me to the train station so I don't have to go alone although Thursday is supposed to have a one day freak of rain which is just awesome since I have to walk to the train station and switch trains and then catch a bus at the airport to take me out to my hotel. Awesome I say. Friday night my family and I are going to Olive Garden. I CANNOT wait! Let's just hope I make it through customs and make it to my connection to Memphis. I only have an hour and 20 minutes, but I'm flying into Cincinnati, so hopefully it won't be bad. For Olive Garden, I'll run. 

I'm not even going to comment on the Michael Jackson trial. But I think it's super cool that Alicia Silverstone got married!

I finished reading Scarlett, and I'm glad I read it, but it was total crap. Alexandra Ripley couldn't write her way out of a paper bag. Plus Rhett was barely in it and that sucks ass. So there. Next I'm going to read Love in the time of Cholera. Exciting."

"event","This past weekend was the Cote D'Azur, and it was AWESOME. We went to the beach and tanned and we ate really good food. The hotel was creepy, but it was the only bad part (I'm copying J West here: the hotel was called the Hotel Dante: ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here""). Saturday was Cannes, which was sandy and kind of like a beach at home. FYI: All the women who go topless are OLD, like 60's OLD. Poor Nikki saw some old man's nastiness when he decided he needed to take off and ring out his speedo. Eww. Sunday we went to the beach at Nice, which is rocky, but we had already decided we weren't going to lay out so no one had on bathing suits. J West wanted to go swimming in it bad, but couldn't so we picked up rocks and took pictures. Then we went to Monaco which I think had to be my favorite part. We were walking over to the Casino Monte Carlo when we stumbled across a Chanel. I swear I heard angels singing. (That's why I'm smiling so big in my new facebook picture.) Then we went by the casino and walked down the strip with Prada and Gucci while I drooled profusely. We took the bus out to the castle and the buses were running for free that day! I heart Monaco. So we got to see the Castle and the cathedral where Princess Grace and Prince Renier were married and are buried. It was awesome. That night after dinner J West put on her bathing suit and dragged us all down to the beach and she swam in the Mediterranean. It was funny. Then Jamie, Nikki, and I watched rollar bladers while J West called her Daddy and this poor guy was trying to impress Nikki (which was pretty much the case with every guy all weekend when Nikki's around) and kept knocking cones over and looking like a moron, so he moved the cones closer to us so she could see him being a jack ass up close. It was hilarious. Monday we came home and I was exhausted (the hotel beds were ASS) and grouchy, but it was an awesome weekend, Monte Carlo style. 

Yesterday Katrin and I had to go pick up our grades. It was nerve racking. But... we passed! YAY! So last night we went out to celebrate. We went to this crazy restaurant that's like old time-y Gaulle or something. Like you have pitchers and one cup each and they grill your meat in the room and it was weird, but the food was good. Then we went to the Pale for the last time and got pints and Katrin FINALLY stole a Guiness pint glass. She's been saying she would for the longest time now, so it was an exciting day. 

I also bought my second suitcase yesterday. It's MASSIVE. I did a practice pack and all of my stuff fit with a little room to spare, so I think everything will get home without having to involve the french postal system. I'm just ready to pack and get the apartment clean, or rather to get all the technical stuff over with. I'm starting to get nervous about coming home, but I can't help but still be excited."

But no one else was doing laundry so I got to come back to my room while I waited for everything and I read a lot of Scarlett which is what I'm reading now (obviously). Tomorrow we leave for Nice (yay!) and today I got everything arranged for me and J West to go to Paris and Euro Disney next weekend (it's the last weekend before I go home). We're going to go up the Eiffel Tower and I've decided we're going to go by the Moulin Rouge, and then we're going to go hang out with Le Mickey Mouse.

1. I am happy for Paris Hilton and for her parents who are going to save a ton of money considering both bride and groom have the same f'ing name!

2. I'm glad Brooke Shields stood up for her self and told Tom Cruise to mind his own business (he called her ""irresponsible"" for taking antidepresents when she got postpartum depression). I get sick to death when I hear men preach about women's issues. What the hell does it matter to Tom Cruise if Paxil helped Brooke Shields not throw her baby out of a window?! I think he may be one step away from full out crazy himself, but maybe that's just my opinion. 

3. Mr. Watergate ""I am deep-throat"" guy, if you happen to read my livejournal... I want you to know that you have spoiled one of the single most interesting mysteries of American history. What good does it do us now to know who you are except that your face was on People.com for one day (and you're kind of old and not pretty to look at... sorry)?! Learn to keep a secret! Shesh! 

4. I heard the American news is blowing it out of proportion, so just to clarify... there was no rioting in the streets or bombings coming from Germany when France downed the European constitution.

"event","This morning I got up at the ass crack of dawn (8am) to take Bonnie to the train station. It was really sad and I already miss her. Damn it's weird.

But in other news, I have my peer group! It was super exciting. I met her at the Institute and there was a lot of screaming and hugging and everyone was super jealous. Then Metka introduced me to the entire group which was weird because they're all going to be like ""Who's the weird girl who never comes to class?"" Oh well. So Metka was freaking out about our trip to Nice and took us to the train station to show me how to buy a train ticket which I have done 500000000000000000 times. It was insane. So we went back to my apartment (me, J West, Jamie, and Nikki) and checked the train schedule online and got our tickets this afternoon so Metka would calm the hell down. We went to the Institute and were sitting around on the benches hanging out and the two guys I had met earlier who are on their trip showed up and were talking with us and then Metka showed up and started yelling at the Joe kid because he hadn't met with his host family to go get his bus pass this afternoon and it got really heated and then J West points out Jamie who's making a really funny face and I burst into hysterics which made everyone else laugh and I basically saved Joe from getting his face eaten off by Metka. Everyone on their little trip seems really nice. It's weird though. Tours feels different. You can kind of tell there are Americans EVERYWHERE, and so it feels a little more like a summer program even though I don't have to go to class, which is AWESOME. I was also a little nervous about J West, but we're still totally a peer group and can still read each other's thoughts and whatnot. That's totally cool. 

Well I haven't gotten a whole lot of sleep lately, so I'm dragging ass and I'm going to go to sleep. Holla'"

"event","Today Bonnie and I did an all day drunk. At 1pm I arrived at Bonnie's with two bottles of Heinekin. Then we went into town and ate paninis and bought a bottle of wine each. We went back to my place where we drank about 4 fifths of the bottle to get nice and drunk before we went on a trolly ride around Tours (which we don't even remember). Then we came back and finished our wine and then Katrin came over with her friend Rachel who is visiting. We danced around to silly music and music videos and then we went out for some food around 11pm. We just got back (it's midnight) and there are obnoxious Arab boys partying outside of my building, being loud and obnoxious, and I can't close my windows or else my room will turn into an oven now that it's actually summer in france. I don't even want to close my blinds because then they'll know I'm in here and buzz my room which is obnoxious. Especially when you've had an all day drunk and really need some sleep. Damnnation."

Sunday I ended up skipping the wine festival to sleep and have some Wendy time. It was fun.

Monday I took Katrin's friend Nathan to Amboise (Katrin had to go to Angers) to see the chateau and to see the house that Da Vinci lived in for the last three years of his life and that he died in. It was pretty cool. There were a bunch of kids though. I don't like kids in groups. They are obnoxious. 

Yesterday we all went to Blois with our friend Saara. We went to the chateau and went to the house of magic and saw a magic show, etc. It was cheesy but fun. For dinner we picked up pizza at Domino's. It was the closest to being home we've eaten in a loooong time. Saara and I split a Hawaii-ian. It was awesome. 

Last night Bonnie came home! Yay! We all decided that it feels like we're going home for vacation, but then we'll be coming back next semester. It'll feel a little more real when we get home I guess. We'll see.

Today's laundry day. Bleh."

"event","Today was the wine festival... and if anything can get me out of my room it's a promise of all you can taste wine for 3 euros. It's an awesome time of year. So you go into town and the festival covers a ton of space, and for 3 euros you get a cute little wine glass with which you can taste as much wine as you want. And you can use it for both days because the french drink on Sunday. I went with Katrin's friend Nathan (who doesn't like wine at all), Katrin (who likes everything), Saara (who only like Rose), Emily (who like me is a huge red fan but I also enjoy a good dry white). We met this really funny old man who's North Korean but lives in France named Peter. I also met my soul mate. He was really fun to look at and he had bright blue eyes and he wore capris (they're popular here and according to me, men look hot in them) and if he's there tomorrow I'm going to take it as a sign that he needs to take me out sometime before I go home. Emily and I tasted his wine and you could taste just a little bit of cinnimon in it (Katrin said we were retarded, but I told her Emily's and my paletes were more adept to tasting the subtleties of red wine) and Emily said it tasted like Christmas. It was yummy and so was the guy serving it. I'll keep you posted on whether or not I'm going to elope and move to a french vineyard. Oh and P.S.... Saara tried to explain to two old men about the drinking age in America and they thought it was retarded so they didn't understand and it took her like 10 minutes to get the point across. Yay for America."

"event","Today was fun. I left the apartment (happy J West!?) and Katrin and her friend Nathan and I went to find the theater that has english films, but it was weird and not really showing anything. So then Katrin and Nathan went sight seeing so I went shopping. I went to the foreigner bookstore and got Scarlett, A Year in the Merde, and Fairytales by Hans Christian Andersen. Then I went on the search for something to wear over my bathingsuit when I go to Nice and in the very last store I found some linen capris and two white wife-beaters. How exciting and cute! So on the way home I swung by the other movie theater to see what was playing and went home via the boulangerie where I got a strawberry tart (happy J West?!). So today I left the apartment and I ate a french pastery. It was a very productive day. Today was also hot as a mother, which wasn't too much fun, but I think I got a little sun on my face, which makes me happy."

It's really f'ing cold here. Like yesterday's high was 62. It's the middle of May. It's supposed to be hot and sunny tank top weather. I think mother nature missed the memo. 

So now I have four weeks of nothing before I go home. I still have to cancel my phone line, cancel my internet (which apparently includes writing a letter and a hoop of fire or something), buy a suitcase, etc.. etc... I also have to call Bama Parking because they still think I need a comuter tag. Last year I had to go in and change it, but I don't want to have to do that again, so I'm going to call... from France. Bastards. 

My friend Laura is leaving today to go back to Canada. She's one of the first to go, and it's really strange that it's already time for people to start heading home. Sad.

Katrin has a friend (who happens to be a boy) coming to visit which means that as of tomorrow she's staying with me for a week. Her friend is also getting here at 7am tomorrow so she's going with Laura and staying at the hotel with her tonight, which means I get to wash sheets so that she and Nathan have somewhere clean to sleep. I'm hoping I can slip my sheets in there too. We'll see if I can wing it. If anyone wants me to get them fun french underwear send me an e-mail with your size (I wouldn't want you to have to post it in a comment) and I'll find something fun and first-date-esque for you.

"event","I got a pity talk. I'm 21 years old and I got a pity talk! I was online the other day and my friend who happens to be getting married this summer (a small civil ceremony, but she ""already feels married inside her heart"") gets online and after gushing about how she's ""sickeningly and fabulously"" in love she asks me if there's anyone in my life so I told her I was ""sickeningly and fabulously"" single, and then I got the pity talk. She told me, ""He's out there Wendy. Maybe if you slowed down you'd be able to find him. You're always on the go, but he'll find you if you let him."" Oh gag me. How does she know I'm not running from him (which I honestly probably am doing)?! Well then she has to bring up my ex, John and she asks me ""so how are you doing with that?"" People. I broke up with him, and it was a year and a half ago, but whenever I'm single she brings him up EVERY time I talk to her. It's obnoxious. So this time I decided maybe I needed to stop sugarcoating and I told her, ""Darling, I was over John before we even broke up."" So then she tried to convince me that I needed to date this guy who I've been friends with since the sixth grade. Doesn't she think I could have handled that on my own sometime in the past 10 years that I've known the kid?! Not to mention the fact that the guy is like a brother to me, and that's just sick. It's like it's terminal to be single. I understand that she is dellusionally happy being in a committed, marriage-bound relationship at 21, but to be completely honest, to me, serious relationships (especially those that seem to be marriage bound) are overrated and they tend to give me ulcers (see the quiz result below entitled ""The Keys to Your Heart"", particularly the section that relates to marriage). You know the episode of Sex and the City where Carrie breaks out in a rash and has panic attacks because she and Aidan get engaged? I have a sneaking suspicion I would go through something similar, considering my most serious relationship (which lasted a whopping year and a half) gave me ulcers. Literally. Love made me throw up blood. So if you're really my friend and really care about my well being try to keep me out of relationships so my stomach and the rest of me can rest easy."

"event","I saw and heard the most disturbing things EVER tonight (no not about Renee Zellweger and Kenny Chesney, but what the mess is that about?!) when I went out with my girls for an early night coke/hot chocolate at Place Plume... I'll start with the scary one and move on to the funny one.

-We were walking down this street and this man and woman (who look like they may be on drugs and were very white trashy) were yelling at each other and then all of a sudden he reached over and grabbed her hair with both of his hands and started to violently shake her head. This woman stopped and was watching this until he started screaming at her and she didn't want to get hurt so she walked off and we picked up the pace a little. So we get down the street and this man is dragging the woman by her arm and she's screaming at him to let her go when I see him smack her across the face. He keeps pulling her along but now it's by her neck and when they get to the cross walk she falls down and he grabs her arm and drags her across the street while she's still down in front of traffic. She gets up and they keep fighting until they get on the bus. The most disturbing thing... no one did a damn thing. They just watched it. It was nausiating.

-Now for something a little more funny. Recently my sorority sister Abby had the perfect engagement, but tonight I heard about the absolute WORST engagement EVER. This guy, who is apparently a huge sketch ball and cheated constantly on his girlfriend of ten years, decided it would be a good time to get married and how does he pop the most important question he's ever going to ask? He puts the ring in between his butt cheeks and moons his girlfriend. I am NOT joking or elaborating. This man put an engagement ring in his ass in order to ask his girlfriend to be his wife. The most disturbing thing... she said yes."

"event","I am on my last leg, so if this doesn't make any sense... tough.

I love London. Just FYI... 

<b><u>Friday:</b></u>
-Katrin and I left for London from the Tours airport (it's the only flight that leaves from it on Ryan Air... sketchy) and it wasn't a bad flight and we were both excited because we had managed to finish those damned papers for our civ professor who had agreed to meet us at 2 on monday when we get back. 
-We land in London and try to use the ATMs to get pounds and two different machines tell me that my card isn't valid or something along those lines and so I freak out (important information for appreciating this story: my bank just got bought out by SunTrust and they sent me a new bank card in the mail, but I'm not in Memphis, I'm in France, so I had told my Mom to call and make sure they didn't cut my card off)... to be continued.
-We get into town by the little train. From there it was the handy dandy underground into the part of town we were staying to find the hotel (which was REALLY nice and we got a really good deal). 
-We go down Oxford Street to find something to eat and luck out and find a Pizza Hut! Awesome. We gorged ourselves on garlic bread and I got an individual meat lovers pizza (my favorite). 
-We went by Borders to get a little guide book and so I could pick up some things I've been wanting to read in English. 
-Back to the hotel via a little stand where I bought a phone card. Got to the hotel and I called home and made my Mom call the bank. I called her back 30 minutes later, and because she hadn't called the bank and because she had never verified my new card they had cancelled my old card. So I am in Europe with no means of getting cash. Woopee.
-We try to relax and watch tv. We saw Windtalkers (crap) and Intolerable Cruelty (REALLY funny). Then we planned out the weekend and crashed.

<b><u>Saturday</b></u>
-We got to Westminster Abbey at the asscrack of dawn and saw the church, which was really cool. I hadn't been in since I was 13 so I liked it a lot.
-Then we went to Buckingham Palace for the changing of the gaurd, but the place we were standing at didn't have a great view, and it started really late, so Katrin and I watched like 20 minutes of it and left. 
-We went to St. Paul's Catherdral which I had never seen the inside of. The crypt was neat... lots of famous people, but not as cool as Westminster. 
-The favorite part of my weekend... Shopping! I went to Top Shop and Urban Outfitters and loaded up on cute British things for my closet. It was awesome.
-Dropped the goodies off at the hotel and rested a bit.
-We went to Piccadilly Circus and walked down to this Indian restaurant I LOVE over by all the theatres. The exact same waiters were working as were working the 500,000,000 times I went there this summer. They had changed the table clothes from coral to lavendar however.
-Went out to see the lights on Piccadilly and oooh and ahhh. It was fun.
-Bed time...

<b><u>Sunday</b></u>
-Also an early morning, so we ended up getting to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum at 9:30 (which is ungawdly in my opinion). It was fun though. We got goofy pictures with different people and it was fun. It was weird though, because now (as oppossed to when I was 13) your tour winds up at this planatarium place where they show a rinky dinky thing on stars and the vastness of the universe and blah, blah, blah... It was dull, but the only stupid part. 
-We walked down to Hyde Park via a Starbucks and an ATM for Katrin to go to Speaker's Corner. It was hilarious. Some man was RANTING about religion and about how women don't need to try to be men because men have enough problems as it is. This other guy was wearing a sign that said something to the effect of ""Listen to me. I am very clever. I know everything. Blah, blah, blah...""
-From Hyde Park we caught one of those open bus tours and took it around to see all the sights. It was ""V.E. Day"" to celebrate the end of WWII so Trafalgar Square was all set up for some outdoor concert thing and random parades of vetrans would march by. It was neat.
-We jumped off the tour at the Tower of London and got a full english breakfast for lunch (eggs, toast, sausage, ham, fried tomato, beans) before going inside. We saw Bloddy Tower and the place where Ann Boleyn was beheaded and the Royal jewels. It was fun. We took a picture in front of one of those funny little gaurds and when I zoomed in on the guy he's sticking out his tongue in the picture! Before that his buddy who had just gotten off duty walked by and made a face at him and he laughed so I knew he wasn't a really serious kind of a gaurd, but I mean really!
-We decided to take the boat to get back into town since it was covered on our bus ticket. The guide was hillarious. It was fun.
-We got back on the bus from where the boat dropped us off and took it around to where we had started the tour. 
-We went over to this movie theatre we had seen to see what was playing and The Wedding Date was starting in 20 minutes so we went in and saw it. It was so cute! We had been wanting to see it and it worked out perfectly (just like In Good Company when we were in Dublin). 
-We walked down to Hard Rock and got dinner. We were both ass out tired and I thought Katrin was going to fall asleep in her Tupelo Tenders. 
-We dragged ass back to the hotel where we called our Mommies to say Happy Mothers Day. We watched a countdown of the top 100 number one singles of all time (we caught the top 20) and I decided that Moby, Sinead O'Connor, and Yoko Ono are evil and need to take a long walk off a short pier. FYI...

<b><u>Monday</b></u>
-Got up at 5:30 and showered and checked out and walked to the underground. Went back to the airport and check in for our flight and I did some more book shopping. What can I say... I'm a nerd.
-Flew home and ran to the rooms to see where our civ professor wanted us to meet her since she had said in an e-mail that she would be giving an exam on Monday when I asked if we could meet her Monday at 2pm. Apparently something got lost in communication and she had sent an e-mail after we had already left for London saying that if we're going to be here on Monday to come take the exam like everyone else, but unfortunately (and we had already told her this when we e-mailed her last week and when we talked to her on Wednesday) we were in the air when the others took the exam. So we went out there and couldn't find her and this nice lady offered to put our papers in her box so we scribbled a note on the envelope and came back and wrote her an e-mail and now are worrying about whether or not she's going to accept the final assignment she gave us. What an f'ing idiot. I'm pissed and stressed out and seriously considering alcoholism. Wish me luck."

But I have to finish it by tomorrow because tomorrow Katrin and I leave for London. Yay! I've been procrastonating like a champ, because I just really don't want to have to do actual work and doing actual work in french is so incredibly harder. Can't I just watch Sex and the City and go to sleep? Damnation."

"event","Yesterday was shoe day, which I am now convinced should be a national holiday. So Katrin and I went to Paris and went to the Galleries Lafayettes and looked around at all the shoes to make sure of what we wanted. Katrin ended up getting some Prada black heels, and I got black Prada flip flops that I know I'll get a lot of wear out of. Then we went on the metro with our huge as Prada bags and went out to the Champs Elysees to go the Gap. Holy hell. Gap jeans here are between 100 and 150 american dollars. So I got a cute top and some capris that were on sale. Then we went to the Virgin mega store where I got a KYO cd and an -M- cd. They're pretty popular french bands. KYO is kind of pop-y. I dig it. 

The weather has been freaky as hell though. Yesterday was ridiculously hot. Then last night we had thunderstorms and it was raining off and on all day, but in between the rain it was bright and sunny. It was freaky. We had a make up grammar class today but only 7 of us showed up so it was kind of laid back. I'm glad I went though because one of my friends already took the final and said it was really hard and it was all stuff that we covered last time and that we were going to cover today. It was kind of tricky, but I get it now so I hope it'll help on the final. 

J-West... I don't know if you heard this yet, but the guy down in Georgia is still wanting to marry the crazy lady who was ""kidnapped by Mexicans""! How stupid can he be? She ran away from your ass! Jeez. Idiot. 

I'll holla atchy'all!"

Being born on the 12th day of the month (3 energy) is likely to add a good bit of vitality to your life. 

The energy of 3 allows you bounce back rapidly from setbacks, physical or mental. 

There is a restlessness in your nature, but you seem to be able to portray an easygoing, sometimes ""couldn't care less"" attitude.



You have a natural ability to express yourself in public, and you always make a very good impression. 

Good with words, you excel in writing, speaking, and possibly singing. 

You are energetic and always a good conversationalist. 



You have a keen imagination, but you tend to scatter your energies and become involved with too may superficial matters. 

Your mind is practical and rational despite this tendency to jump about. 

You are affectionate and loving - but very sensitive. 

You are subject to rapid ups and downs.</td>

"event","I am sick. I have a cold or allergies or something. My head is a giant snot ball.

<b><u>Top 5 things I miss about being sick at home:</b></u>
5. Doctors who I'm not afraid of
4. Drugs I know I can find at the Walgreen's
3. Klenex with lotion in them
2. My Mommy and Daddy
1. Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup... or better yet, Chicken and Stars

I am not a happy camper. Last night I took two sudafeds to try to make me feel better and sleep, but the room started spinning really bad and I was afraid if I fell asleep I would get thrown from the bed and plummet to my death. I feel like ass. Ground up ass. Hopefully this will pass and soon."

"event","I think that if I tried to write a livejournal entry about my trip it would take WAY too long, so I'm going to give the short version... We went to Geneva, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Paris. It was two and a half weeks. It was fun. I bought a pair of Gucci sunglasses. I met my cousin's 82 year old Lucana mother who doesn't speak Italian, but a dialect from southern Italy. I spoke French and Italian and when I got home yesterday I was absolutely exhausted. It was a good time and I'm still trying to recover from intense physical and mental exhaustion. Training around Europe can be a bit of a bitch. Now back to school on Tuesday.

I have my final due for my cinema class on Thursday. A two page paper on a movie... then I'm done with that class. Awesome. Tonight a lot of my friends got together over at my place and we got two pizzas from around the corner and watched Miracle. It was really fun to get to just hang out with my friends again. I'm going to miss them when I go home. 

I think I'm just rambling so I may quit while I'm behind and head on to bed."

"event","Today was the beginning of my three week spring break. Don't be too jealous though. I just got done reading about Meredith, Meuchal, Brig, and everyone's break and I'm TOTALLY jealous. My crazy european spring break will be serving as a tour guide to my grandma. No crazy drunk/ make out stories from me! Sad, but oh well. 

This week isn't technically supposed to be a vacation, but I'm making it one anyway. Today I bought train tickets and went grocery shopping. Crazy exciting, I know. Since I finished reading the book I borrowed the DVD of Gone with the Wind from Emily Miller. I have to agree with my mom though; the book is better even if Clark Gable is gorgeous. 

So life is still technically boring, but I'm sure I'll have a bunch of fun stuff to write about when I get back from two weeks of touring around Italy. Holla'"

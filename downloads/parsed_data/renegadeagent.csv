"event","Well, 
Today is shaping up to be the toughest, scariest and saddest birthdays I've ever had. Or any day period. I feel like the floor is dropping out on me. I have no choice but to give the control of my life back to God for the first time in years. I know I'm just your average christian hypocrite for waiting to turn back to my true relationship with God until He was all I had left, but that's the long and short of it.
After years of saying it, I'm finally willing to let it go and start treating my faith as what it is: A personal relationship with God. Not  a way of dressing or a certain translation of the bible, or condemming others and finding fault but simply a One-on-one relationship between me and God that takes thought and time to build just like any other relationship.
There are lot of things I am pleading with him about right now and a lot of direction he's been giving me from unexpected places. I never thought He'd give me a miracle, but He has in how He's changing me. Maybe it isn't too late for more.
I'm sure to whomever stumbles on this it may not make a lot of sense, but those of you who know me just keep me in your thoughts and prayers.

Thanks"

"event","Not much to update here right now, work is interesting this week. Lots of poo hitting the fan, and the rest of the poo is standing in line waiting patiently for it's turn through the blades of death. There is only so long that people can put up with things going like this at work, and I don't know how long that'll be.  It's all I can do to try and keep my mind on task and my temper in check for 8 hours till I can get home and do something mindless, but that has it's problems too. As somebody I respect a lot pointed out to me I haven't been doing a great job following through on putting together a budget and I've been feeling the effects of that. I just need to find a day when I can focus long enough to sit down in a chair and type it up.

On a slightly more interesting note, I ran across this story today. http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=424 Odd shot in the dark, or the wave of the future? You tell me. Either way, it's a bit scary.  I get the feeling that within the next 20 years humans are going to have some powers we aren't morally equipped to deal with in a beneficial way. Come to think of it, it's probably been that way for a while now anyway. Back in the dark ages mankind was sort of in a 'padded cell' so to speak. Yeah, we could go to war and kill a lot of people, but nobody had the ability to pretty much wipe out mankind as a whole the way we can now with nuclear power and biological weapons. And when you throw things like being able to 'predict' crimes, and genetic modification etc into the mix things get a wee bit freaky all of a sudden."

"event","Just saw AVP tonight on DVD. It was in fullscreen, which was minorly annoying but all-in-all it was a much better movie than I expected. I started out jokingly predicting who was going to die first (Hint: the guy who shows off a picture of his kids in the first 15 minutes always gets killed later on) but then I realised: It's a sci-fi action thriller, all but one person dies. High art it isn't, but at least it has that much in common with Shakespears' tragedies.
It would have been mediocre at best but good effects and some nice twists in the third act made it worth the watch."

"event","I've been reading up on the new Xbox 360, and let me just say right now that the new incarnation of xbox live will probably be looked back on as one of the milestones of change in the culture of connectivity.  It looks as though you'll be able to carry on voice and videochat with anybody else who has 360 and the proper gear. There will also be pay-as you go downloadable media content. Ultimately, Microsofts' bid to bring the internet out of the office and into the entertainment room may start a pretty fundamental shift in our media habits."

I stopped reading cause I couldn't understand any of it without a dictonary, an understanding of the finer points of electrical engineering and some sort of degree in higher math. Does anybody else find it ironic that we are grounding the shuttle because nobody can figure out how to keep pieces from falling off of it?"

I'm finally over this darn cold for the most part. For some reason, I've started having some back spasms though.
It's all good, I actually got out of the house and the office on tuesday night, and somebody special showed me a really nice little coffee house.

So, some sorta big news...apparently work is sending me to africa(!) to help the production team shoot some stuff. Like AFRICA! as in, it's warm and the sun is out and all that stuff. Oh yeah, then there's the shots...I got a couple of them today, with about 4 more to be done on monday. And malaria pills too. The thing is, most of the shots need to be taken 4-6 weeks ahead in order to be effective...and we are leaving on the 23'rd, so that makes me a little bit nervous.
I went to Miejer photo to get some photo's for my visa....no such luck, thier camera was busted. Anyhoo, thought i might see some friends I know that work there,  but no such luck. Ended up going to Wallgreens for the pics. bleh."

      tree</strong></em></font> today. Even with all the <strong><font color=""#FF0000"" face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">l</font><font color=""#00CC00"" face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">i</font><font color=""#0000FF"" face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">g</font><font color=""#FF6600"" face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">h</font><font color=""#CC6600"" face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif""><font color=""#FF0000"">t</font><font color=""#00FF00"">s</font></font></strong> and
      whatnot, it's still a saaaad looking tree, in my honest opinion. I bought
      the last few christmas presents I needed to get today, and boy was
  28th street a madhouse. :-( I meant to stop and say 'hi' some friends at <strong><font color=""#FF0000"" face=""Times New Roman, Times, serif"">Miejer&reg;</font></strong>,
  but <font color=""#000000"">Mel</font> was apparently deep in the bowels of the
  system somwhere and I never saw her. Hope you made
  it out alive! Kendra, you looked like you where having a lot of fun working
  the lane...next time
  I'll
stop and say hi, promise.</p>
<p>Thanks to the person who is responsable for all the <font color=""#CC00FF"">pretty

"event","Things I learned early wednesday morning:

I Learned that you can spout cheesy one-liners and still be loved and adored by all the girls, as long as you are Orlando Bloom in pointy ears.

I learned that a three hour movie can seem too long and way too short at the same time.

I learned that 2 coffees, orange soda and fruit punch makes you wish there was an intermission.

I learned that ROTK ROCKS!!!

I learned that IHOP is open at 4 am, but they aren't used to serving 6 nerdy LOTR fans and random drunks at that time of the morning.

Did I mention that Return of the King is awesome?

I learned that when IHOP is understaffed at 4 am, they let patrons answer their phones, and serve other customers.

I learned that some people are very hyper the next day, if they haven't had any sleep.

I learned that my car is terrible on the snow.

I learned to hide my keys.

I learned to listen to my intuition. (ask me about it, the story's not as deep as you might imagine.)

I learned that it's great to have friends."

It seems that though we have a chainsaw, you need gas to run it and we where a little short of that....despite dads' trying to siphon some from out of our truck. Note to self:apparently, stealing gas isn't as easy as it looks. So, I cut down the tree with the handsaw. Enter problem number two. Sidenote: Ever notice how things outdoors tend to look small until you try and stick them in your living room? Yeah...so it seems a ten foot tree won't fit in a room with a nine foor ceiling. Enter the saw. walla, nine foot tree, nine foot ceiling, everybody happy. Oh...but why does the tree look as if someone hacked off the top of it?"

Well, it inspired me to stop slacking off and actually PRACTICE. Anywoo, Ring Of Steel is Tommorrow, So it's all good because I'll get 3 solid hours of practice time in.
We are cutting down a Christmas tree tomorrow. Usually for our family, finding the 'right' tree is a complex process that involves walking around in the cold and examining every tree avialable, and comparing their relative merits. (much like shoe shopping with a woman, only with frostbite.) This year however, we opted to take a tree from our property, so things will be much simpler. We even get to use a chainsaw.
Well, Everyone have a great weekend! Andrew, We'll hafta play some video games this weekend. Yay!"

In a feeble attempt to feel better about living in this wet, cold state of ours, I've written this little list:

**The Top Ten Reasons Michigan is Better Than Hawaii**

10. No active volcanoes.

9. Doing donuts on the highway is fun.

8. Hurricanes? what are those?

7. Wearing little grass skirts and flower necklaces gets old.

6. If you live in Hawaii, where do you vacation to?

5. Pineapple juice drinking fountains stink when you're really thirsty.

4. It's great not mowing the grass 4 months out of the year.

3. Traveling out of state doesn't cost 999.99 round trip. And we can buy the little bags of salty peanuts at walmart anyway.

2. It's fun to laugh at crazy drivers just after the first snow of the year. 

And THE NUMBER ONE REASON MICHIGAN IS BETTER.....

1. Um......yeah, riiiiiiight."

Lame and stupid, you say? Wait! there's more. I translated it into spanish using bablefish, then back to english. Below is the original piece of tripe, followed by the computer's translation.

THE ORIGINAL:
""For a moment, everything seemed cookie-cutter beautiful. The sun slanted across the road, leaving pools of amber light and warm shadows, defining the shapes of the trees just budding there leaves, some green, some amber brown. The fields were the brilliant color of new growth, and like in a perfect storybook town, at house after house people were crossing the road to pick up their mail after a long days' work. With the perfect choreography born of chance, they moved in unison. And for a moment, I felt sure I must be living in a car commercial.""

THE ENGLISH-TO-SPANISH-TO-ENGLISH TRANSLATION
""for a moment, everything looked like the beautiful cake-cutting. The sun inclined through the way, leaving swimming pools of the amber light and the hot shades, defining the forms of the trees hardly that bloom there go. Some green one, certain brown an amber one. The fields were the color shining of the new growth, and like inside a perfect city of storybook, in the house after the people of the house where crossing the way to take they send there after the long days work. With choreography perfect taken of the occasion, they moved in unison. And for a moment, it felt safe I to me I must live in an announcement of the car."" 

Even better than the original! (not that THAT would take much..) Instant comedy! I may be onto something here. IF anyone else has any submissions, feel free to post them in a reply to this entry."

"event","i had a superb time!

my man had booked a room at MBS for our anniversary! so happs! he had wanted to surprise me but he told me ahead just in case we wanted to bring Alyssa along. and we did! 

we did contemplate abt bringing her cos i wasn't sure if we cld enjoy ourselves or would we be ""burdened"".. hee hee..

the weekend was a smooth one i would say.. =) i woke up early cos Alyssa did.. =_="" but i slinged her and we went to the market to get breakfast for her daddy dearest.. came home and it was only 8am. gosh.

waited for her daddy to wake up ard 9am.. then she was feeling sleepy so i put her to bed.. was just nice! me and him had a leisurely breakfast.. i bathed and we watched ""the incredibles"" togets.. she woke up ard 11am.. gave her a bath and we played for while.. and ard 130pm we left to go out.. he had wanted to drop by the tailor's to get some stuff.

we arrived at MBS slightly after 3pm.. we topped up to get a city view room! but as it wasn't ready yet.. we walked ard for bit before finally going up to our room on the 21th floor at 430pm.. the room was gorgeous with an even more gorgeous view! the bathroom was huge with a tub big enough for two!

Lil Alyssa was so excited when we put her down on the sofa.. i felt so happy to see her huge smiles and laughs! bouncing up and down! =D
We had decided to go for the buffet dinner..but since it started at 6pm we went to the skypark on 57th level.. it was awfully hot and crowded so we stayed awhile.. went down to the hotel and had our dinner.. pricey but alot of variety! 

after dinner we went up to the room anticipating to watch the race at 8pm.. hahaha! but only then did we realised that the relay match starts at 10pm..but no prob! so we gave our girl a bath.. and we played ard for while before settling her to bed. after which we had some couple time! =D  But due to the comfortable bed and conditions... we fell asleep by 11pm! muahahaha!
but of cos we did take in the breathtaking night views of the city.. really special and nice~ directly opp the fullerton hotel.. nice view to fall asleep to!

next morning! Alyssa slept pretty much like a baby (pun intended) and only woke up ard 645am.. which was pretty much her usual wake up time.. but after her milk she actually fell back to sleep! hee! joy for me! i woke up 20 mins to 9am while she and her daddy continued sleeping.. i had thot we needed to check up at noon and we still wanted to swim so i was afraid we would not have enuf time mah.. turns out i busied myself for ntg.. he extended the checkout to 2pm.

well.. so while i was preparing the luggage and her drinking water i woke them up.. haha! so we changed and went UP to the pool! the pool was really really beautiful and it helped dat it wasnt crowded ard 10am.. so we enjoyed our first family swim dere.. again as long as it was swimming or water-related, Alyssa was duper happy. and as long as she is happy, we're happy too!

after a fantastic swim, we were starving! me and the man.. after we went back to the room, we gave her a bath and fed her milk whilst we took quick turns to take a bath and get ready to go for some food! 

we went coffeebean for breakfast and i had the breakfast platter! yummilicious! he had pasta.. haha cos it was ard 1130am... after dat, we shopped around and had intended to leave ard 3pm cos dat was when the 24 hr valet carpark charges ended.. however, 2 of his frens were dere.. so we met 1 of them before checking out.. after checking out, he wanted to check the floating LV.. so we decided to forget the charges and stayed on for more shoppin!

by 430pm, exhaustion set in so we decided to go off.. but at this time, another of his fren called and wanted to meet up for coffee.. he wanted to treat us.. so we ended up having an early dinner at the hotel! by the time we left, it was 7pm! and at 7pm, the first fren we met had wanted to give us free walkabout F1 tickets! hahahaa! but me and the hubby were oredi too tired.. besides Alyssa was with us.. we wanted to go home, give her a bath and relax oredi.. so we forgo his kind invite..

our weekend trip was really fun! and am so proud of lil Alyssa cos she is super adaptive! even till now, when i leave for work, she doesnt cry.. which is both a relief and a disappointment.. haha!

but i definitely can't wait for the next hotel stay! i wanna go back to MBS! perhaps end of the year? *winks*"

"event","alyssa is now 4 mths 5 days. *gosh* each time i look at her i marvel at how fast time flies! she was still a lil bub 4 mths ago and now.. bigger baby. hahaha!

she did her first flip on tummy on 2nd feb (few days short of 3.5 mths) very proud of her! =) and best thing was i got to witness it. i was disappointed dat i might miss out on events like these but thankfully i got to see it.

she's now more responsive and can grasp things (which she tries to put in her mouth)  the fun part now is to watch her learn new things. but of we haf to watch her more carefully cos she flips once we lay her anywhere. =_=

2 weeks ago she started coughing so it was quite tiring to look after her at nite. cos each time she coughed, i'll be worried she'll choke. thankfully her cough has improved abit. =)

now i'm always looking forward to the weekends when i can spend time with her and my man. =) i really enjoy gg out with them even tho its tiring and i haf to bring along alot of things. hahaha.. 

another of my close fren is preggy! great news.. hee hee.. now dat i'm *ahem* a mummy, i can understand the bliss and joy (and the occasional frustration)  of having a child. sometimes i wish she can grow bit slower so dat i haf more time to see her grow. =)

altho i love alyssa loads, i'm not very sure if i want a 2nd kid. primary reason is i dont wish to go thru the pregnancy, confinement and stress of losing weight. 2nd time round i haf even less confidence.. besides, having to pay for 2 kids is not cheap nor. ^-^  hence the hesistation. of cos my hubby wants. typical. sigh... but i'm definitely not thinking of anymore ""creation"" until 2012. i wanna rest and enjoy my time with alyssa.

each time i look at her sleep, i'll smile. just seeing her sleeping makes me feel contented. and when i see her with her daddy, i'll feel even happier. so i guess its true a child can bond a couple even more... =)"

"event","wow... been like what? almost 5 mths since my last post. =p

can't blame me.. been occupied with the new member of our small little family.

today marks the day dat i return to work. mistakenly too. =_= hahaha! but i too lazy to summarise.

well the past few mths for me haf been many emotions. BUT! mainly great! =D

i've got a new gal to play with.. ever since my confinement lady left, i've been assigned her new caretaker. hee hee.. and i think i did a great job considering its my first attempt.. i'm still constantly adjusting to her, and her to me.

guess we're pretty lucky dat she's quite easy to care for. but again, their patterns change.. like for the last 3 nites, she hasnt slept through the nite as easily. boooo.. cld it be she knows dat i'm gg to work? sigh...

being a mother is different and not so different either. i still feel the same! act the same and love pretty much the same stuff.. except i haf an additional role.. 

having her been in our lives for 3 mths 1 week, i would say our relationship is still strong.. she adds a lil fun in our lives.. even till now when i look at her, it feels amazing that she's a combination of us. how she has grown from a 1cm cell to the present stage.. 

starting work poses new challenges.. and i'll not get to see my lil gal. =(  i may not get to see her many firsts.. but life is such. but i'm grateful to be where i am and to have what i have now. 

Oooo.. will miss her funny expressions esp when she sleeps. she can whimper or chuckle in her slp.. really fun to watch! and when she yawns.. itz super adorable! she'll end it off with her own sounds.. and when she sneeze too. =)

of cos, taking care of her has its not-so-nice moments like when she's crying and struggling during her cranky hr. ya.. not so nice.. hahaha!

overall, motherhood has been vy enriching... everything has been worth it. since the moment i found out i was pregnant. =D"

"event","With our lil one on 18th oct! Hee.. Yup. 

Went to see my gynae ytd and routine scan shows dat she's oredi approx 3.4kg which is above average since I've got abt 2 wks to my EDD. Dr suggested inducing as he's concerned abt a too big baby for natural delivery.. =p I've been drinking more full cream milk lately cos bb was only 2.5kg 3 weeks back & I felt her growth was bit slow so worried. But turns out she's doing better this week plus!

Anyway we discussed the date w Dr & between ourselves to arrive on 18th oct.. So likely I'll deliver on 18th or 19th (my dad's & ann's bday) depending on my labour progress. I'll be seeing my Dr on Monday 230pm..by the time I'm warded shld b 4-ish? Gosh!! Nervous lor!!

Dr discouraged hot date like 20/10/2010 as there are mote scheduled c-sec ops on the day..in event dat I wld need an emergency c-sec, he doesn't want my safety to be compromised as manpower is likely to be tight.. The hubbs wanted ytd or today but Dr said if labour drags to weekend it'll b additional cost. =_= plus his surgeries are all scheduled on fri afternoons & he prefers dat his patients don't induce on fri as he doesn't wanna haf to worry abt me and the planned surgery.. So yah lor.. So we decided on 18th! I quite like the date lah.. Now we haf to 'convince' our lil princess to stay in till then! =) 

I had the worst pelvic pain last nite.. Her weight rested on my vagina & butt area so one will perpetually feel this pokey feeling alternatively on these 2 areas. Sobs! And when she shifts her head I feel a jab of pain in the vagina area. Quite xinku.. Last nite I oso had pain similar to menstrual cramp in my lower right side.. Worried me!! Cos we planning to see her on 18th or 19th mah! But the pain was gone in middle of nite.. But will try to rest more on bed..so ironic! The days before ytd I was anxiously looking out for signs but now dat a date has been set for inducing we rather wait.. Haha! Was hoping me & the hubbs can go for movie & bit more dating.. ^*^

I haven told all my frens abt me inducing yet cos dunno wanna gif another false alarm.. Haha! But Monday shld be the real deal. But shall wait till my labor is bit more progressed! Really scared, nervous and yet excited too! There will definitely be a huge huge HUGE learning curve ahead of us! 

Quite worried abt breast-feeding too.. I mean it's good for baby & weight loss..but I'm worried my supply might not be ideal.. Or baby doesn't like to latch etc.. And the fact dat my breasts will no longer be 'mine'! So weird!!!

Sigh but for now I only wish to see a cute & healthy lil girl! Datz the most impt for us... =) looking forward to her first cry! (altho I hope she cooperates & doesn't cry much after..tee hee)"

"event","The thot of myself being ""alone"" in this pregnancy arose again. 

Not dat the hubbs isn't loving or helpful or doesn't take care of me.. But I realize we missed out a crucial bonding chance. We shld haf attended pre-natal lessons togets while we cld. But previously I thot itz mostly a waste of our time.

Looking back I regretted it. It wld haf made the hubbs understand more abt pregnancy, my changes & preparing for the new family member. Sometimes I wish he cld be more involved in the knowledge-sense. I wld be able to discuss w him on pregnancy topics. Most of the time I find myself feeding him info.. Which I'm not sure if he gets. =s 

Again I can't fault him entirely cos I do understand he's generally busy & I shld haf been more sure or insistent.. Oh well.. We can only play by ear oredi.. >_<"

"event","Cos it means the hubbs has more time with me! =s

Being on maternity leave has been mostly boring for me cos I'm home alone 90% of the time! From the moment I get up to the time I sleep. =(  it's gettin to this preggie woman, ME! 

Due to the hubbs's job nature, it's inevitable.. Sometime I really wish I haf a hubby who has the same working hours as me... But I do not. It's not a sad thing per se but something I've to adapt to. I think I've been vy independent & sensible when it comes to this. I mean, it's great to haf ur own place & do things at ur own pace. But it gets pretty lonely after sometime..2-3 days of such long days can make one feel miserable.. In my case I even haf to da bao my own meals (I usually go down to get dinner, lunch is a more simple affair of cornflakes w milku. Breakfast is sometimes bought by my MIL) & having meals alone, watching tv alone (I even wanted to talk to the person in the tv show just now! Haha!) 

However my hubbs is pretty appreciative of my independence & understanding which is a consolation itself. And he has the habit of calling me often or msging.. This is a relief of cos.. Otherwise I'll feel like totally alone. :/ I guess in my current state, there is a natural tendency to be even more doted & pampered on.. Sigh.. I wish so. But the hubbs has been mostly great! Hee hee.. He's still sweet towards me.. (he better be right?! After all I'm baking his 'bun') 

I just wanted to rant/whine tonight cos tonight I don't feel 100% ok., but still alright.. Just needed to get this off my chest cos I got bitten by the lonely bug. =(

"event","Well.. We've finally come so far! Today I'm 37wk2days preggie.. Our lil gal is finally considered full term & shld be a well-developed baby.. Datz by far the most reassuring.. =)

Since my discharge last last fri, the past few week or so, we've been mentally prepared for baby to be out anytime soon.. Looks like we're still waiting.. >_< I'm guessing we'll just get more impatient as this drags on.. It is a dilemma thingy for me as I haf to go through the delivery process before I can see her.

Yup..... Still super scared of the pain to come! I even had 3 dreams of my doctor so far! I din dream abt the baby's delivery process per se but it all has something to do with the baby.. Hahaha! I'm now even more likely to take epidural altho my hubbs has been trying to convince me not to. But I feel more confident if I had this choice.. So I'm gonna use it when needed, datz for sure!

Baby's stuff are better prepared which is a relief.. =) I think we prepared most of what we shld? So this time round we wld definitely be better.. Haha! Now we're oredi bit impatient.. The last time dr did a VE for me was last Monday & I was 2cm dilated.. Wonder why last thurs & today he did not check me? But it's a relief cos oso bloody uncomfy & pain. This morning I asked dr if baby is engaged (for delivery I meant) & he said oredi engaged so I cld probably give birth anytime soon.. Ookkk.. Means still gotta wait lor! It's the suspense datz gettin intolerable.. Like when or how?' I prefer a 'show' which in preggie terms means a bloody discharge..similar to start of menses but definitely not vy heavy.. I feel it's less drama than having the waterbag burst! =p I'll prob haf time to go salon to wash my hair & bathe before ""checking in""!

Baby weighs about 3.15 kg as of today.. Lil bit heavy since I don't know when I'll be popping? in 2 days or 2 weeks time. I better monitor my sugar intake these few days too. =)

Daddy has the date 10/10/10 in mind but we'll let our lil princess decide of cos!"

"event","tuesday started off as normal as normal could be. =_=

dat morning we left for office togets.. was abt 45 mins late for work cos of traffic jam.. other than dat, it was a innocent day off to work.

however whilst in the car, i started realising i keep feeling the tightening of tummy regularly like every 5-10 mins which was a first! at first i thot it cld be the false contractions commonly known as braxton hicks.. i think from the time i got on the car, it started or as far as i cld remember.. it continued till abt 11am.. and i started feeling bit uneasy.. asked pj and she suggested i call the clinic even tho my contractions haf no pain or backache.. i decided not to take the chance and called my doc shortly after. 

upon hearing abt my condition,the nurse told me not to wait and just come in to see my dr. i was huh! orh.. so luckily hubby was still in office so he sent me over. upon reachinig the clinic, they put me on this CTG machine for half hr which measures baby's heartbeat and frequency of contractions.

after which Dr did a VE for me. stands for vaginal examination! OUCH! hahaha! and found me to be 1cm dilated.. said i shld get admitted right away and i was HUHHHHH!! so scared! cos i read from forum, even a mummy at 2cm dilation was allowed to go home first.. and i had to be admitted dere and then! u shld see the faces of both us at dat moment! hahaha!

and then they gave me an injection on my buttock. sobs! pain pain... Dr said it was for baby's lungs in case baby decides to come out these few days.. the injection will help baby's lungs to mature faster.. i had to take a 2nd dose of injection 12 hrs later..

so anyway they called for a wheelchair to bring me up to the delivery suite.. =_=  and once there, we panicked and informed our family and frens cos we really thot i was gonna deliver anytime within 2 days.. hahahaha! forgive the first-time parents. =p

so for next 3 days, i was warded.. initially was afraid on the first day especially since i heard 2 mummies doing their delivery.. the first one was scary! hahahah! made my body go all soft when i heard her screaming.. so i din slp well the first nite.. in fact not sure if i did! was just a bundle of nerves especially when he wasn't in hospital cos he had to tie up some loose ends at work and get my hospital stuff.. i hadn't packed anything at all! but he did great.. i was just nervous dat he wouldnt be back on time if i really was gonna deliver.

2nd day, both of us calmed down as Dr had found i remained dilated at 1cm.. contractions weren't as regular.. so i settled down to a routine whereby the nurse came in 3 times a day to connect me to the CTG machine to monitor me and baby.. baby was especially active in hospital i felt.. but after 3 nights of stay, Dr finally allowed me to go home! cos contractions were irregular and not frequent plus i was still 1cm dilated..

so home sweet home for us! totally glad to be home! i think baby too.. she's more ""quiet"" perhaps more relaxed? since i am too? UGH... hate staying in hospital..

my hubbs has been really sweet and it has been tough for him, he has had to juggle some appts, take care of me... accompany me and also, help his parents in moving the house.. physically he is exhasusted. i think for previous 3 nites, he barely slept 3 hrs each nite and still had to run errands the whole day.. he wasn't in hospital with me all the time but he still made the effort to so i thot he was sweet. =) i mean its his duty too... but at this moment, he just has too much on his plate.. so i kinda understand he can't be with me all the time.

so here i am, back at home. i haven recovered my energy back completely but definitely some! i tidied up baby's room just now.. her cot is here! to see it finally in the room is such a joy. hee hee.. just feel happy.. joy of first-time parent! like vy cute lo! can imagine a baby inside.. kekeke.. so i'm probably gonna put on the bedsheet once its properly dried and air-ed. i've also tidied up my hospital bag..

so i think the next time i go into hospital i wouldn't be so lost and panicky! good for the hubbs too.. hahaha!

now we'll just wait for our lil one's arrival.. its good she has decided  to stay in a bi longer since she'll be a borderline premmie if she's out now.. but dr has said at wk 35, most babies do not have to stay in incubators.. they are mostly developed just smaller than normal.. 

i've got 10 days to reach full term of 37 wks.. so i hope she will continue to grow well! not sure when she will come out.. within 2 weeks? since i'm 1cm dilated.. hmm! but now dilemma cos means i haf to go thru delivery pain.. yikes! =p"

"event","i was reading xiaxue's blog post on the passing of her hammie. suddenly i thot of my own hammie - pokka

she was adorable.. and like wat xiaxue said previously she couldn't imagine how one can bond with a hammie. apparently she has and i haf. i think my hammie, pokka was one of the longest pet i had.. i was the sole caretaker of her..

i cleaned her cage, bought her food and her cage stuffing. i gave her treats like chocolate and yoghurt (after i finish, i leave a dollop on my spoon and feed it to her).. she laps it all up! =)  i loved her dearly becos she doesnt bite me and allows me to handle her anyhow. =p  so i like to cup her in my hands and rub her soft fur. and kiss her! hee hee!

and she's the best companion when it comes to exam period! cos she'll be mostly awake.. hahaha! so when i burn the midnight oil, i'll bring her into my bedroom so she can accompany me.. halfway thru my revision, i'll take a break and play with her.. otherwise she will be running on her wheel.. it makes me less lonely.

i still remember when she passed away.. for abt 2 weeks, she started eating less and was noticeably less active.. she just looked sickly so i had the feeling dat she did not haf long to live.. i remember it was nov 2004 when i was cramming for my uni papers, fearing that she might just leave without me knowing.. i determinedly brought the cage into my room despite my mum saying dat its not hygenic.

i saw her breathing hard inside the cage and was so heartbroken.. i gently stroked her and told her to leave if she's finding it difficult. i told her how much i loved her and how great a pet she was.. while stroking her, she just stopped breathing. i was so upset.. must haf cried buckets! 

but in another assuring way, its like she heard me and i couldn't be more happy dat i got to accompany her before she passed away. =(  

after she breathed her last, i laid her in a box filled with soft tissue. i placed the box in a clear plastic bag and vacumn-packed it. yupss... cos i din want those insects to come bother my hammie. i want her to still be a whole. i then got my brother to accompany me downstairs to dig a hole so i could bury her. i couldn't bear to throw her in the rubbish chute as she's too precious to me.

i think her body is still dere today.. in dat small plot of flowerbed. to date, she remains as one of my most favoured pets. =)

i would love to own a pet again and i would. i think its very important for kids to love animals.. so that they grow up to be loving beings. like moi! =p"

was gonna meet my family at tamp mall for dinner and we were slightly late. upon reaching tamp mall, he said he wanted to go ntuc and i kept badgering him for the reason.. cos we were oredi late. he asked me where was ntuc and i pointed the direction out to him and he asked if i wanted to stay on the spot to wait for him. i agreed cos it was crowded.. and soon, i saw him walking towards me with a smile on his face and hand behind his back.. i thot he bought something for me to eat. hahaha!

but i got an even sweeter surprise! i got this!

i went ""huh? for wat?"" hahaha.. he jokingly said how come whenever he gives me surprise i always go ""huh""?? cos when he proposed, dat was the first word i uttered too! hahaha! he revealed it was for our 1st wedding anniversary! but lunar date - eighth day of the eighth mth

tee hee.. i couldn't stop grinning afterwards.. =p

i love him more especially in moments like these! romantic boy ~ kekekeke! but he's usually vy affectionate towards me which i love too.. =p  

dere is this thing bothering me too.. i'm afraid of how having a baby will affect the dynamics of our current relationship.. i wanna remain the same with him! as lovey-dovey and mushy as we are now! i still wanna be the ""main attraction"" in his life! =s

really can't take it if there are huge changes.. =(  but i shall not let baby ""take over"" either.. haha! there are many women who let children become the focus of their lives.. its not wrong but i feel dat the husband shld not be neglected either.. 

after all, its us both who will walk the rest of our lives together.. after the children gets married etc.. 

*shhhh* but i do kinda regret a bit abt not waiting a bit longer to start a family.. when i think abt it now, i realised we're probably gonna spent 1 married year alone only.. altho we pak tor for almost 3 years.. but its not the same cos we weren't staying together and hence, unable to do more coupley stuff.

but of cos i still want our lil one! perhaps i'm worrying too much.. hee.. 

dat day someone asked if i'm expecting boy or girl (quite a common qn these days) and i answered girl. he said girl good, next time get a boy so can haf one of each. i replied ""we can't choose them, they choose us"". it was a straight-from-heart kind of answer.. and i thot i made pretty good sense! hahaha!

so our lil gal chose us at this time so its definitely fate.."

"event","had another lousy nite of sleep. i think its gonna be this way till indefinitely... =s  one of the forum mummies say its training for the nites when baby is out. ha.... 

sigh.. i tried gg to bed ard 11pm.. he wasn't home yet, was out networking with some pple at clarke quay. he mentioned he was tired and i was afraid he might drink.. but i still nodded off and woke up ard 1am.. he still wasn't home.. but i din msg him cos usually after 2am, then i will be more worried.. so i thot nvm. i fell back to sleep and he came back shortly after.. 

woke up at 5am to pee.. and couldnt really go back to sleep.. i probably spent the time daydreaming and zoning in and out. =(  i fell asleep just when my alarm rang. #$@#%^$

my dear hubby came to work with me.. he must be really tired too.. cos he has had late nites for the last 2 nites. =s  heartpain to see him working so hard! sigh.. but tonight will be an earlier nite for us i hope. meeting my family for dinner as its my bro's bday.. gg seoul garden! kinda looking forward to it.. it was the hip place to eat at when i was back in sec sch and jc. but afterwards, the lack of variety and price kinda got to me. wasn't worth it.. ntg much to eat for wat i'm paying. so i think i haven been dere for 8 years? hahahaha! really long time anyway.. 

rainy morning is making me even sleepier... sobs. i wanna haf a good nite's rest! 

shall i take mc tmr and nua at home? super tempted.... doing pedicure in the evening tmr. =)  

supposedly meeting the guys on fri nite.. but they are meeting ard 8pm.. will i be too tired?

sat i've got a gf's wedding. hence, i decided to do my nails this thurs! kekeke.. still got package mah. =_+   

oso lots of ""preparation"" work to be done for myself.. i'll go for another pedi in 2 weeks time (after this thur's appt) but will not apply nail polish! cos i heard from some mommies in the forum dat they will usually remove nail polish of mommies during delivery as nails can help the doc gauge the condition of the mommy.. so must haf clean nails.

and i intend to go for B wax next thurs.. =p  the last time i did it was quite some time ago.. i din remember it hurting badly.. still tolerable.. so i wanna do it so that post-delivery, it will be cleaner <i>down dere</i>. =)
and oso not ticklish for baby when she comes out. muhahahaha! so yah.. some concerns of doing B wax at tis point is inducing contractions.. cos if too painful, one might haf early contractions. so one reason of me doing next week is also cos i dont wanna haf too early contractions. choy~ actually the waxing itself is not dat pain.. its when they try to clean the area up by using tweezers. =_= any stray hair dat wasnt pulled out cleanly. 

and oh yup, i washed my darling lil bub's discharge clothes over last weekend.. not alot. =p  but i was still pretty excited to wash and hang it out to dry! too cute! 

here's a pic! i only washed her romper, bib, 2 caps, mittens & booties, tummy wrap, a swaddler, a blankie.

the reality of having a baby gal is becoming a glaring one.. we'll soon haf our own little ""doll"" to take care of. =p

recently i've been feeling physically weaker.. as the tummy gets heavier, i feel lots more tired. and these few days, my calves already start feeling tight in the morning! by the time i reach home, my lower back is aching and so are my feet. when i walk, i really haf to take it slower.. =s

the feeling is quite sian. like this morning i had to take the train to office, it was so warm and dere i was, waddling... by the time i reached office, i was in foul mood. cos the tummy was really weighing me down.. there is this tightness in tummy that makes me unable to stand straight up. really shagged!

sigh.. but haf to remind myself dat i gotta hang on for few more weeks.. but then the delivery part scares me so. =(  so dilemma! hahaha!

sigh... really in not much mood to work liao.. these 2 weeks have been busy cos my boss is not ard and i gotta take care of my own daily operational work, plus some projects like the audit and last-min problems dat my staff face.. and i haf to leave by 6pm. so i've been feeling this stress.. 

feel like taking mc tmr.. i've got internal audit on the 17th (fri) so thurs better not take leave.. then only choice is tmr.. but is my bro's birthday and i still gotta meet my family at tamp mall. =s

i really wanna take leave soon!!! but i can't! i'm on leave next thurs.. which will be a busy day itself.. gynea appt in the morning, meeting pj ard 11am..shop shop then we'll be having high tea. baby cot will be delivered on same day as well.. =) looking forward to cot's delivery! 

then end of the mth is our busy period so we seldom get to take leave.. after which, one of my colleagues, Ann will be on leave for 3 days. either she or me has to be around.. so if she's not here, i haf to be in office. then my next leave will be 8th oct. 

following dat week, will be the actual audit week so we'll need to ensure everything is in place.. by then its mid of oct! if i really dont birth by then, i'll start my maternity leave on 20th oct.. cos 18th and 19th, Ann is on leave.. =_=  so i must wait another 5 weeks before i can start my maternity leave. SOBS! I fear i cant take it physically.. feel like just lying in bed the whole time nowadays.. i dont wish to be stressed at work or as long as they dont disturb me and i just finish my own work first. 

to add to it, these few nites, i noticed i'm becoming an even lighter sleeper! nowadays when he comes in the room to check on me ( cos i sleep first), i'm awake cos i was oredi half-awake! cham~~ insomnia really.. SOBS!
nowadays when i feel xin ku, i pity myself. =s  one will tend to have this ""oh i'm so poor thing"" mentality cos its not easy. 

but i must JIA YOU! now's not the time to give up."

my lil gal is now abt 2.3kg! =) her growth seems to have stablized.. grew abt 300g since 2 weeks ago.. if this continues, she shld be slightly past 3kg upon birth! i think abt 3.3kg is good. =p  got a colleague who's more petite than me gave birth to a bb gal 3.53kg! so i guess i haf ntg to worry abt! tee hee...

and........... we managed to get 4D scans of her! =) happs!

initially she was shy, she kept her face turned away and her little hands were covering the face.. =s   my gynae had to keep nudging my tummy in a bid to get her to shift her hands which she finally did after abt 10 mins. dat was when we cld start taking satisfactory facial shots. 

here's one of her with her hands covering her face!

i think she looks like daddy.. hahaha.. perhaps its the nose. =p

but still her features can change.. only from 6 mths onwards, they grow into a more permanent look i feel.. =) the first 3 mths usually change vy fast. oh well! glad my lil gal decided to cooperate (after much nudging) today after all! =)

the clinic has given me the admission letter today (yuppy!) cos i haf less than a mth to full term so there <i>might</i> be a chance of delivering early oct. nervous after getting the letter cos it definitely feels even more real! and i've been advised to prepare my hospital bag oredi. =_=  i was just gonna do so.. need to go pick up some necessities soonish!

and oh! its confirmed i'll be doing confinement at current place (dancing for joy in my heart) but then we'll have to pay off 2 mths mortgage for current place exclusive of our usual mthly contribution. =( 

but bo bianz... just hope everything goes smoothly for us. *fingers and toes crossed*"

"event","we're now contemplating moving into the new place right after i deliver (if logistically possible)... means i will doing confinement at the new place.

it makes more sense if we can move in earlier so that our current place can be rented out earlier so that we do not have to pay an extra mth's mortgage. but of cos lots of complicated planning if we choose to do so.

gonna get the keys for the new place from the lawyer tmr... so this weekend we can start noting down the defects. after which we haf to confirm with designer on the final design of our place.. and then they can start on the reno works and complete within 3-4 weeks. 

however i forsee that if we wanna move in right after i deliver, time is kinda tight. cos starting from this weekend, we prob need at least 5-6 weeks before the new place is fit for moving in. by then i will be in the 37th / 38th week, so there is really a possible chance i might deliver anytime then.

there are other little things like packing, moving of certain furniture over ne? its not gonna be an easy task. sigh.. 

we've bought a new tv (LED! super sleek) , new washer and microwave for our new place. why? cos to remove the current tv is not exactly ABC easy, gotta get someone to dismantle it and reinstall at new place which wld cost easily $200. =_+  we got a new washer cos we wanted a quieter one. as for the microwave, the new place doesnt haf one! we bought a built-in one but he's thinking of switching it with the current one. hee.. bigger mah.

to save costs, we're gonna move over the current sofa, fridge, dining set, sound system, my serta mattress (i lurve it! am glad we spent bit more on the mattress back then) and possibly the coffee table as well. so this means we need to get replacements for all these items as well. cheaper ones of cos! hahaha! super budget-constraint! no point in letting our tenants enjoy good furniture while we take lousy furniture mah.. =p

sigh.. the reluctance to leave current place is coming back. when i saw the layout of the place, i oredi sian. now we haf to spend a bomb to alter it into a more livable place. =_=  

hate the kitchen, so little cabinets and squeezy dat we haf to add new ones...and the bathtub in the master is totally redundant. so small, how to use so we've gotta spend money to hack it all away and make good the area. these 2 areas oredi gonna cost us almost $10k. super annoyed. we oredi tried so hard to cut down on the stuff dat we need to do.. and now we're toying with the idea of not adding a mirror at the foyer (like current place) and doing a concealed wall for the living room (cos the stupid common toilet door faces the living room), these 2 items add up to almost $5k. its definitely a huge sum for us at this point. GRRR. why the house cannot be designed better!!!

anyway enuf of dat house.. 

============================================================================

i woke up at 515 am for a pee pee and then i found myself to be hungry. weird! but i resisted to even drink milk cos i was too lazy to get up. in the end, i just laid in bed till my alarm rang. 

so this morning i'm feeling vy tired.. -_-   with tiny eyes. and i feel a headache coming on too. sigh... jialat. dunno izzit cos of my poor rest last nite, dat i'm feeling the heaviness of the tummy so early in the morning.. my waddle is getting more pronunced. 

and bloody hell, its raining heavily at my office here. super wish i was still tucked in bed! sniff~

sigh... i'm gettin impatient abt baby's delivery date. but definitely i gotta hang in dere till 37th week so she'll be full term and major organs all developed. i'm just sooo tired of all the aches and weight dat i have to lug ard. =s

"event","actually there is a different way of counting.. i can also say i'm in my 34th week.. cos today is the day i crossed the 33rd week of pregnancy.. =)  getting more excited and scared as the weeks pass.. =p  i'm really quite scared u know.. not kidding abt it. when i think of the image of delivery, my heart stops for a beat and i banish the thot to the back of my mind once again. i haf to remind myself its a must to go through this and i will. 

even told my lil one dat i'm scared too.. haha! and best if she cooperates to give me a fast and as painless as possible labour. ^^ with the condition dat she comes into the world healthy and safe of cos. so many worries but i'm trying not to think too much at this point.

ytd i went to look for a little cap for her homecoming trip. =) i settled for something so-so cos not alot of choices.. i will be bringing her clothes to be blessed. =p so i need to prepare a set of clothes for her.. 

this is the most simple and nicest cap i could find at kiddyland

and i went to look at receiving blankies too (the blankie used to wrap newborns when they return home) and i spotted a cute pink minnie mouse one. actually i oredi haf a swaddle kind (oso in pink) but pj suggested i get a trad one in case the other gets dirty. basically a swaddle wrap is used to wrap the baby's arms and legs so they are cosily tucked in, and its the short-cut version of the trad receiving wrap. i was contemplating if i shld get it but the shopaholic in me gave in! the reason i gave myself was dat when she gets a bit older, i will let her use as a real blankie. hahaha! i wouldnt feel safe to cover newborn with blankie in case she messes up the blankie and covers her own face.

so i got it!

and i chanced upon this romper too! damn! i told myself to stop buying oredi.. =s  but too cute to resist. polkie dots again with an ice cream cone (my fav snack!)

actually i wanted to get another 2-piece white set..which looks innocent and sweet.. but i decided not to over-indulge in shopping so i only chose the romper. =)  still got some will power left ne~!

i'm now awaiting 1 romper, 1 dress, 4 pairs of socks and 2 pants i ordered online for her. =)

dat day i took out all the clothes i bought for her.. actually not alot either lah. i counted quite happily and excitedly

- abt 10 (0-3 mths) pieces
- abt 5 (3-6 mths) pieces
- abt 7 (6-9 mths) pieces
- 3 to 4 pieces of above 9mths

datz a rough estimate cos i can't recall totally either.. i will supposedly get some hand-me downs from his nephew and cousin's son. but those clothes will be more boy-ish.. those can wear at home. but if someone visits us or when we go out, i'll let her wear those i bought! =) much prettier... 

i'm guessing baby's clothes will be washed every 2 to 3 days, so the ones i bought plus some hand-me downs shld be quite sufficient?"

i received an email update dat a baby blogshop had new arrivals so i went in to take a look.. and saw some really cute stuff. =p  so i sort of ordered a few pieces.. hee hee.. but all of them are pre-order so gotta see if there is stock. but i've gone and ordered 2 dresses, 1 romper, 4 pairs of socks and 2 bottoms. this will cost me ard $70+. kinda ex ne~ but shall check out the stock first.. haha!

i've not gotten any hand-me-downs yet so bit worried abt the amount of clothes to prepare for her.. but to be frank, i've been buying and not noting how much i haf. in my mind, i feel not enuf lah.. will wash the baby clothes in another 2 weeks so hopefully i can ""stock up"" if not enuf. =)  not sure if i shld get more rompers anot.. or separates.. and so far, i've been buying mainly bigger sizes so dat baby can wear longer.. tee hee.. 

======================================================================

feeling huge lately and looking huge i'm <b>sure</b>. many ppl haf commented how <b>fat</b> i've become. =s  it is definitely my largest size ever lah! sigh... but then wat to do ne? 

all for sake of the lil one! ann says its a good sign dat i'm putting on weight cos means baby is healthy and growing well. during my whole pregnancy, i've never gorged on food nor snacks agressively.. my only lifelong weaknesses are ice cream and chocolate but i'm still eating my desserts like i used to or perhaps bit more only. so, i dont understand where my weight gain has come from! 

perhaps from more carbo? from the end of 3rd mth onwards, my appetite was really good but the best i could do is finish a whole meal (i could never finish a meal in the past) and i would need a bun in the afternoon to tide me to dinner.. i also ate more heartily for breakfast (i seldom took breakfast in the morning in the past).. so i guess datz where all my calories come from. =(  and the 2 large boxes of durian i had when i was in the midst of my 4th mth.. hahahaha! but i haven had any since i found out i put on 4kg in the 4th mth alone. i <i>think</i> i've been taking too much sugar intake from my birds nest as well.. my MIL makes birds nest with rock sugar and the previous 2 batches were really sweet dat i had to mix with water.. i think dat played a factor. 

another thing is i notice dat my arms have gotten firmer (but much larger obvs).. =_=  last time is soft soft one.. might be due to the vitamins i'm taking.. my mum says fish oil will make me fat! i din know dat.. but since i found out i was preg i've been taking 1 pill daily. =s  but good for baby's brains so can't miss out!

anyway no point in analysing my weight gain eh? since i've got abt 5-8 weeks left to my EDD. funny thing is my appetite has shrunk again. can hardly finish my breakfast / lunch / dinner even tho i get hungry quite fast. only a few more weeks to go so i shld probably just concentrate on baby's development.

am determined to get my pre-pregnancy weight back asap after delivery! can't wait to get started on my exercise regime (provided my lil one is cooperative so i can get my MIL to take care and i can go to the gym / swim)

its depressing to be this huge especially when i look at my old pics. =(  sometimes it truly gets me down. but the hubby has been really sweet.. he still tells me i look gorgeous and sexy. =p  what a great hubby i haf! hee hee! so also partly for his sake, i'm eager to lose the WEIGHT!

also, when i was pre-preg, i still get the occasional glances from men. nowadays once in a blue moon, i still do but i'm not sure if its for the same reason! hahahaha! damn it! i hope at least its something positive like ""oh she's preg and fat, but her face still ok lah"". u know? datz already positive to me! hahahaha! but seriously, i know the attractiveness factor has dipped drastically since i got preg. =(  kinda affected my self-confidence as well... but on most days, i think ""heck it, few more months only""

know wat? deep down i still feel its worth it. =)  some pple haf lost half their weight so as long as i haf determination and discipline, i'm sure i could do the same.. its a matter of want or not. 

so i'm aiming for my old body! but this time round, i'll haf a cute baby gal in my arms. =)"

"event","my lil one is 8th mth old today! wowee.. another mth or so to go before we see her! =p

i think the initial part of taking care of her will be more trying with us being new parents and all.. and usually newborn babies' features arent so obvious till 6 mths later.. i like babies at 6 mths cos easier to carry and more fleshy. hahaha! i find them more cute at dat age lah.. too young like vy fragile.. =_= 

nowadays i like to play with my nephew.. like to squeeze his arms cos he vy ""ba ba"". not too hard of cos! =p  except i can't carry him much cos of my tummy and he's vy active so i worry abt him squirming and kicking my tummy. but after i ""pop"", i'll haf to carry my own baby liao. haha! the hubby will say its tiring to carry the nephew after barely 10 mins. =s  i told him next time u'll still haf to carry ur own child hor!

my next gynae visit is next thurs! now the frequency has been shortened to 2 weeks. =)  on my last visit, i couldn't do the 4D scan which was rather disappointing.. cos baby has turned downwards and had her back facing us so no point in doing the scan unless she faces front at least. =(  i'm gonna attempt again next visit.. see if she's guai anot. =)

in another 5 weeks, i'm gonna reach full term! exciting... and scared cos it means the delivery date is near. my SIL says its not dat pain.. hers was more aching.. she said her back felt sooo sore that she thot it was gonna break. well, she had the epidural and after dat, she said it was ok. SUPER tempted to just opt for epidural.. but the tiny sadist side of me wants to see how much pain i can tolerate. LOL! =p

last sunday, we went bugis for lunchie and i wanted to take a look at the bedsheets for baby's cot.. we ended up buying baby's detergent, bath gel, powder.. =) PJ says like so early?! but i thot we haf another mth or so to go.. might as well get..

i'm getting the baby cot delivered in about 3 weeks time.. and i aim to wash the baby's clothes soon and packed nicely.. i still haf my hospital bag to get ready wor.. so hopefully by 3rd week or last week of sept, everything will be ready! then i can just wait for baby's arrival with no housekeeping worries. =)

oh! 2 bottoms dat my SIL got for my gal. =) i like the piggy one.. haha!

suddenly it seems scary how another week has flew past!

received great news today! haha! work-related lah.. basically i was supposed to be on leave this fri cos gg for gynae visit and wanna do a 4D scan.. but last week, there was an email for a workshop and i was to present at. =(  imagine my sian-ness.. so i was actually gonna come in on fri morning for the presentation and then go for my check-up. but now the workshop has been shifted to monday so means i'll be on leave for fri! yea! happs! 

can't wait for the scan ne cos can see baby's features.. at least some sort of facial feature or expression i hope? altho probably not an accurate depiction cos still might change and babies' faces change very fast! but i'll like to haf the memory.. initially i was sceptical abt the scan.. not sure if i wanna do it. after all, it costs $200 for a scan of perhaps 15 mins? and i'm not sure how many pics i'll be given. but then since its my first-born (and possibly only child?) i thot i better haf no regrets. at least i can look back and take a look at how she is in my tummy. =) 

i really love to feel the way she moves in my tummy.. when she's gentler of cos. feels like little waves.. and when i rub the area, she'll nudge against the area too but i'm still not sure its the head / arms / legs. =p

i think it will be soon dat the baby moves downwards and head shifts downwards.. then definitely i'll feel a heavier load on my pelvic region. =s

sigh.. another year of many changes!

last year i was talking abt changes in my life.. marriage and moving out of my home in pasir ris..taking on new roles as wife, daughter-in-law, sister-in-law etc... and now i've got another new role this year. a mommy. gosh. hee hee.. 

and i'm gonna move house. again! hahaha!"

"event","i've been in my 3rd trimester for 2-3 weeks now.. lately the symptoms are getting more significant.

and the most significant would be - <i>exhaustion</i>

for past 3 nites, i reached home around 930-ish and then at nite, i can't seem to have restful sleep.. so by last nite, i was thoroughly exhausted.. when i got home, i felt really damn pek chek. 

i was so tired and my tummy was feeling heavier than usual... i was draggin my feet as i got out of the car. the combination was almost enough to make me cry. when i got home, i really wanted to cry out in relief. it was quite bad.

after my bath, i felt better and after having a snack, i went to bed ard 1030pm.. i think last nite was the best nite among the last 4 nites... so this morning i felt bit more refreshed. however, the tummy definitely feels heavier..

=s  still got abt 6-8 weeks to go before i pop! i shall remind myself to hang in dere... but its definitely getting tougher.. its the exhaustion coupled with the increased weight and its a combi dat feeds off each other.. with more weight, u get tired easy and once u get tired, any extra weight feels even heavier. =p

sobs! now i understand why women are encouraged to give birth when they are young. cos its so freaking tiring at the last trimester. 

shld i do some exercise? but wat kind? only light swimming perhaps. my legs look damn swollen now.. i told him my calves look like those french loafs. hahaha! oh well, i'm very much hoping its water retention so after giving birth i can massage it all away!

my tgif will be spent at home resting away! i shld be gg home myself this evening bah.. oh can't wait! i quickly get my dinner and go home and chill.. still got 5 hours to end of workday and 6+ hours before i can lie on my couch! 

tho i secretly hope the hubbs can come pick me up and go home straight.. =p  but i understand if he has work engagements.. sometimes i think i'm such a good wifey. hahaha!"

hate it.. it can be soooo painful! and i've had to bite my blankie lo.

this morning, when i was woken up by my alarm, i turned over intending to switch it off and dat was when i experienced of one those excruciating leg cramps. obviously i couldn't turn off the alarm but my dat heavey sleeper hubby was still in dreamland. =_=

so bo bianz. i clutched his arm in pain. and he woke up with a start! hahaha! he thot wat happen.. like am i gonna deliver? hahaha!

anyway told him my leg cramp was really painful and asked him to turn off the alarm for me. he did so and then wanted to massage my leg but i told him NOOOO.. this kind of leg cramps aren't like pins and needles! its really p.a.i.n.

so only way is to allow pain to subside and let the leg relax.. after awhile, i was finally able to straighten out my leg but then the muscle pull was still dere. even till NOW! yupz.. will probably continue for bit longer tho i've been applying yoko yoko periodically since this morning... sniff."

she's now 7.5 mths old.. =)  EDD gettin closer... 

i'm also gettin easily tired more! i tend to get breathless easily cos the uterus has moved higher up and possibly pushing up my lungs. so when i walk a bit faster, i get bit ""chuan"". =s  gettin up from a lower seat is gettin bit difficult too, i gotta position myself well before i use some angle / effort to raise myself up from the seat. and my tummy will only get heavier which will be good for baby. i think i'm carrying a front load of abt 2.5kg to 3 kg right now.. baby's weight plus its water bag.. so when baby's weight reaches 3kg, my front load will be roughly 5kg plus? *phew*

still got another 7 weeks to full term.. sounds fast hor! hee hee.. he jokingly said he's gettin cold feet. i told him i got cold body ah! i still haf to go thru delivery and the confinement ne ~ he go hospital at most help me to ""push"" but will get to carry our baby without physical changes. =_= nowadays i oso fel the fake contractions more.. its tightening of the uterus. when u touch it, u can feel a hard tummy.. supposedly its ur body practicing.. the real contractions will come faster and more regularly, and likely to be painful. right now, mine is just uncomfortable when tummy tightens.

suddenly i'm all nervous and excited at the same time again. some mommies in my forum thread oredi started washing their baby's clothes.. packing and gettin ready for baby. and i haf done zilch! haven pack my delivery bag too.. need to get maternity pads, disposable undies.. gosh! and i haven arranged for the cot to be delivered as well.. intend to start on it next fri cos i'll be on leave. 

next fri i'm gg for my next gynae appt, it has been shortened to 3 weeks interval. and i wanna do the 3D scan! which would cost us $180+. EX! hopefully i can start on some washing of baby clothes (expecting some clothes thru post this week cos i ordered some more! keke! shopping for girls is so fun! many cute stuff lah!) and packing of the guest room.. 

like so freaking SURREAL! we're gonna bring home a baby soon!

oh! and pj's expecting a baby gal too.. =) great news cos she wanted a girl girl! and now they haf one boy, one gal! gee.. i think its more stressed thinking abt the 2nd one's gender.. even now when i think of possibly having #2, i wonder abt the gender. =s  of cos it'll be great if i get a boy boy then i'll haf one of each. but seems like the likelihood of conceiving a boy drops when one gets older (according to some gender prediction chart). oh well! settle this one first.. will see decide on #2 one or two years down the road. =p"

"event","Well.. this weekend was certainly less busy than the one i had last week... which was good. =p

i woke up late on sat morning.. was up at 930am to put on my babyplus and i spent the next hr drifting in and out of sleep. hee hee.. i think i woke up ard 11am.. and proceeded to haf my breakfast of 2 baos. the hubbs went back to the parent's place to pack his remaining stuff whilst i went down to get proper lunch - zinger burger! hahaha! just felt like having it.. i ended up all hot and bothered cos i oso made a trip to ntuc.. super lay chay. sigh.. and heavy even tho i bought a bottle of 2L milk only..

when i got home, i switched on the air con cos i felt bit faint and tired from dat short trip.. after i settled down then i had my lunchie while watching my korean show. =)

i made some brownies using ""betty crocker's"" ready-mix. =p i had initially wanted to make brownies frm scratch but then when i went to ntuc, my hands were full from juggling my drink from kfc and carrying the basket, so i decided to not go buy separates cos i still had to get butter and eggs.. i was kinda pissy so i thot heck it. try the ready mix~ hahaha!

so after i finished stirring the brownie mixture, he came home which was abt 4-ish.. and i put the brownie into the oven to bake. after doing the brownie i felt like napping so i did.. just relaxed on the bed and he went to finish some proposal stuff.. it was abt 7pm when we went down for dinner.. had dinner at some taiwanese-themed resturant.. but immediately after my dinner, i had tummyache again! luckily i live so near. =p so we went back home cos i needed the loo.

i think i might haf found the cause of my recent diarrhoea - yakult. i suspect so lar.. cos in the last few days, i recall drinking yakult plus on sat evening i had yakult right before i had dinner. *shrugs* not too sure.. hehe.. we came home and chilled in front of the telly..

he went to bed early cos he had an appt at 2.30am. yupz... at a club! hahaha! at the areana in fact. sigh.. so he left in the middle of the nite for the appt while i slept on. =p 

on sunday, again same thing. i always nua until 11plus am before i'm willing to get up.. had light breakfast.. took a cat nap of 20 mins before i got ready to go out. he was out at the family factory helping out with some praying stuff.. and he came home to pick me up to go and meet our interior designer.. after dat appt, we went down to beach road looking for outdoor furniture.. found wat we were looking for but we'll still need to consider. then we went back to his parent's place for dinner and left right after too cos he had an impromptu appt.

i was home by 8pm and i watched the last 3 episodes of my korean show. =) such a nice and sweet ending... for once, its not one of those draggy love shows and i thot it was vy well-paced.. shld i watch it all over again? hahaha! the lil girl in the show so cute.. reminds me of my own lil one. hee hee.. 

ahhhh.. another monday another week. FASTER! FASTER! WEEKEND COME FASTER! can't wait for maternity leave... hahaha!"

i got the runs. sniff. went to toilet 3 times so far.. all watery stools. sniff. so i suspect i got mild diarrhoea. but i haven had chili these 2 days ne! except i had nasi lemak for lunch today (cos my colleague da-baoing so for her convenience i agreed to eat wat the others were eating) but i oredi cut down on my chili lots, only had bit compared to previously. 

could it be too much carrot juice yesterday? think i had only 2 glasses ne...not excessive.. and previously i do drink carrot juice too. hmmmm... 

my tummy really more sensitive lately.. perhaps my lil one doesn't like so somehow it gets pushed out of my body.

and best of all? i left the diarrhoea medicine at home. after the previous episode of painful diarrhoea, i had asked my gynae for some medicine in case there is a repeat episode... and clever me, did not carry the medicine in my bag. =_=

thankfully its not like the previous one.. just normal tummyache.. but also worrying cos i dont wanna end up dehydrated. but after my 2nd visit to the loo before lunch, i drink lotsa water after dat. now useless again.. i just had my tea break of sausage bun (hungry after 3rd toilet visit) and hot milo.. but i dont dare to take too much water liao in case i need to visit the loo even more often at nite. sigh..

the reality of being married and preg hit me particularly hard dat morning. kekeke..

wasn;t it great being single and dating before marriage? save for the long distance and travelling for him. =p

but of cos i know in my heart he's the one i'm still gonna end up spending my life with. so marriage is just a formality for the parents. =)

i'm still vy happie with him of cos.. and i love dat i get to see him more often.. and best of all, we're still as affectionate before.. we must maintain dat kind of spark.. especially with the arrival of our princess soon!

call me silly and selfish but i worry abt how having a baby will change the dynamics of my relationship with the hubbs. we surely must put in more effort to sustain the romance in the long term.. i dont wanna become a naggy wife and mother. 

on the other hand, oso quite thrilled abt meeting our ""master piece""... quite exciting to see our ""product"". this lil one will help strengthen our familial bonds for sure.. ""tie"" us together tighter in a way.. hahaha!

well... guess we can only plan along the way! but the picture i haf in mind is definitely a happy lil family. =)  coming from a family history of mine, i understand and value the importance of a loving relationship between the parents and so i will definitely treasure wat i haf with him. in fact, i've highlighted to him dat we shld love each other more than the kids.. hahaha! cos we will still haf many more years to go together... true mah! i wanna grow old together.. and i really can't imagine my life without him anymore.

went for the checkup last sat and my lil one is not so lil anymore! she's 1.6kg.. hee hee.. i put on 3 kg in the last 4 weeks and 800g was hers.. ok lah huh? but still need better control. hmph. how to make all the weight go to her? i think its better if she weighs about 3.2kg at birth.. datz a reasonable healthy weight to haf.. least not over 3.5kg.. =) but towards the last 2 mths, her weight gain will be significantly higher and faster.. and i've confirmed she's still a princess! hahaha! 

had quite a bizzy weekend~

fri nite

after work, i made my way down to bishan to meet the old chums. had dinner at some coffeeshop and then we proceeded to go to pj's house to relak.. my hubbs came to join us shortly.. went home ard 10pm and slept quite soon after too.. tired!

sat

went for checkup at the gynae's.. and then we settled our lunch at tradehub where we went to meet interior designer for while.. the service was disappointing so we gave up. haha! we decided to go home for a nap (or rather i did!) so i managed to catch a few valuable winks before we headed to his aunt's place for his cousin's bday party.. left ard 830 cos the mum needed to be up early so we fetched her home first.. i was still tired! hahaha! same thing every nite.. 

sunday

i wanted to sleep in quite badly but the hubbs asked if i wanted to go see the interior designer his bro intends to get for the parent's place.. so i very generously agreed. =p  left home abt 11am.. and met up with the designer.. sealed the deal and we left for lunch.. i wanted to go home for a nap (again?!) but then itz only an hr window dat we haf (cos meeting my family for dinner) so he convinced me to go his parents' place for awhile.. so we went dere to relak. 

we met my family ard 6 for dinner - zi char at a nearby coffeeshop.. just some simple fare as i did not wish for my mum to cook up a storm.. takes alot of effort especially when she prepares like 6 dishes or more each time. =_= so thot i'll give my mum a break. hehe.. 

after dinner, the hubbs and i made our way to tampines ikea intending to look at their outdoor furniture. to our dismay, the outdoor furntiture collection was a one-time thing!! oh manz.. so we dragged ourselves over to courts to try our luck.. no luck. =s  *pheesh*

monday

woke up late! 11am.. actually i was awake at 930am to put on the babyplus... then i nua until i couldn't stand the hunger so i went down to get mac breakfast. =p while the lazy hubbs slept. horrigble hor! preggy wife go get breakfast for him.. -_- hahaha.. aiya.. but i decided against waiting for him else i'll get crankier..

after a satisfying breakfast, we settled ourselves at the sofa to browse mags.. small talk. and i said i wanted to nap again. hahahhaa! so i went to our bed, closed my eyes and attempted to nap. not much success but better than ntg.. whilst he went down for a swim. 

after he came up, we finally started on wat he has been harping on.. to bake a cake.. we chose a cake receipe from the webbie and improvised using melted chocolate chips instead of cocoa powder.. so dat we can achieve the marble swirl pound cake look. =)  we were indeed amateurs.. haha.. but the cake came out still edible..altho it had a slightly hard crust. kekeke.. but flavor-wise, still ok. =)

after the cake was done, we went out to dinner. wanted to see if his parents new place allowed views of fireworks.. as time was short, we da-baoed up and stepped in the house just in time to catch the last two bursts of fireworks! =) haf to try our luck next year again... but at least can see bit. kekeke!

we went to bed ard 11pm last nite but i had a hard time falling asleep. horrigble in fact. kept waking up every 2 hours... =(

today slightly better, got mood cos longer weekend.. =p

wonder if today will be a good day.. cos boss on leave and ann on half day leave..so i'm not gonna be as relaxed. i wanna eat snake mah.. kekeke...

this evening will be meeting pj, sy and hubbs.. shld rename this grp cos no longer just sec sch frens cos now got hubby and kids liao..""old chums""? hahaha! ya.. old chums. 

since the hubbs has an appt at 7, hopefully he can reach ard 830pm.. i would be hitching a ride from pj from bishan mrt.. gonna take the circle line this evening.. 

i hate taking public transport cos most sporeans no courtesy.. *phessh* and i dont wanna make ppl feel obliged to give up seats but yet i can't stand it when ppl are not gracious enough. 

for this pregnancy, taking mrt has been manageable.. as i stay in boon lay (just haf to take 2 stns backwards to get a seat) and from my office at eunos, i usually can wait for trains with empty seats. sometimes i wait up to the 3rd train but still ok.. if not, i'll be so tempted to take cab everyday! but the 35% peak surcharge is really too ""chor"".

i know its silly but if i get pregnant 2nd time, taking mrt probably wld be more difficult which would make the pregnancy even more stressed. i just dont like the feeling of boarding a train and having ppl tryin to avoid looking at <b>everywhere</b> ard u except YOU. beyond stupidity!! so the hubbs would haf to do something.. can be a chuaffuer or a car if we're are planning for #2. hahaha!

one would think i haf better things to be stressed about pregnancy.. but the woes of a pregnant woman can be ridiculous and numerous! its a right! kekeke.. but of cos, overall, its still a blessing lah. =)

tomorrow's the appt with gynae! yea... finally can see baby's development.. from the mummies on the forum i've joined (singapore motherhood for mothers-to-be due Oct 2010) Some of their babies are about 1.4kg for a 29wk plus baby.. or thereabouts. 

so i'm pretty curious to see how much our lil bub has grown.. and <i>much less excitedly</i>, how much weight i've put on during this past mth.. o_0  *yikes*"

my guess is dat i had too much spicy food for the entire day.. nasi lemak for breakfast, chicken curry noodle for lunch and korean mixed pot rice for dinner which was also bit spicy. immediately after i finished my dinner, i felt tummy pain.. it subsided for while so i ignored it. but then once i went up to my home from jurong point (after dinner with my dad), my stomach was super pain and i chiong-ed to the toilet and was on it for the next 30-40 mins! the pain came and went in b/w.. i did not even haf the strength to go get my phone to msg or wat. =_=

thankfully after 3 successive toilet dumps, my tummy finally settled. *phew* and so i laid on the bed to rest.. waitin for the hubby to come home to see me. after an hour, i was strong enuf to wake up and haf some hot milo.. =p

my baby really can't tahan the spicy stuff. too bad.. guess i shld not try my luck anymore.. nasi lemak is fine.. but perhaps the combination of so much spicy food led to the tummyache plus i had bit of constipation these few days too. 

mummy is notti. =p"

"event","my lil one is now 7 mths old.. =)

was telling the hubby dat day.. how come we start calculating how old the baby is inside us and when the baby is out, we start re-calculating again? dat'll be the birthday.. so we gathered datz why we add an additional year to our birthday age under the lunar calender? hmmmm?

baby was kicking away last nite.. =_= prob she knows i wasn't sleeping well? i kept waking up.. *yawn* and it doesnt exactly help when she was having some kickercise in my tummy last nite. hee hee.. but still cute. LOL. seeing gynae this sat! yea! can see baby... 

i wanna get gynae to confirm gender once more.. cos he told us 2 mths ago at the detailed scan showing me baby's labia. erm.. i can't tell much obviously.. but saw in forum dat some gynae actually made a mistake abt baby's gender! i dont want dat kind of shock.. right now, gender doesnt matter to me anymore as long as baby is healthy and normal. (altho i'm quite excited to haf my own ""doll"")

yesterday, i found out a fren of the hubb's had a miscarriage for 2nd time. sad to hear dat...and i was still happy to hear dat she got preg recently. the couple were the emcees at our wedding and also gotten married last march after a decade togets. they're a very loving couple in their early 30's..hubby shld be 32 i think, wife probably 30? they are genuinely kind ppl who loves kids especially the husband.. i heard dat the wife commented dat they wanted to try for kids right after their wedding as the wife felt dat if they waited a few years before trying and not get, its gonna be a longer wait. unfortunately both times were not fated.. =(  i truly hope they succeed cos can tell how much they love kids.

so i felt blessed dat we haf our lil one. unfortunately sometimes it takes another person's situation to highlight our own blessings. some of the simple things we take for granted like our family, a roof over our head or even 3 meals a day.. =s  over time, these seem to be expected.. 

ahhhh... weekend come faster! long weekend wor!

i need to zzz early tonight. hope hubby can pick me up and go home togets. =p

bought a korean drama series last saturday... and watching it these few days..quite funny and heartwarming."

"event","i've hit the halfway mark for babyplus (u know, the pre-natal thingy datz supposed to encourage alertness in babies, enabling them to cry less, nurse better and hit developmental milestones earlier)..

my lil one starts her lesson 8 today! =) all togets, its 16 lessons all the way to almost 40 wks (end of full term) however, i'm thinking of adjusting the lesson duration from 1 lesson per 9 days to perhaps 1 lesson per 8 days or 7 days.

gosh.. i started using babyplus since 18th week.. and i'm closing in on the 28th week.. means 10 weeks has just passed like dat! yippeee! another 10 weeks to go! both excited and afraid! my blog must be getting boring cos i keep ding-donging between 2 extreme feelings. hahaha!

funny thing is i'm not sure if my baby enjoys her lessons.. i assume so. kekeke.. but she does move during lessons most of the time and i can see the babyplus move up and down due to her kicks.. i shall take it as a positive sign? or is she lamenting how come so noisy outside? hahaha!

at last weekend's BBQ, i asked one fren who used the babyplus too.. i asked if her baby moved during lessons.. she said nope.. this puzzled me. either our baby is really enjoying or she's really hating it. dont know which.. but i'm still gonna continue cos my instinct is she likes it. sometimes before lesson time, i'll feel her kicks and i take it as she knows its abt lesson time and wants to remind me. hoho...

one also has to haf discipline when giving her the lessons cos i've gotta bring the babyplus to work each day and bring home again just so she can haf her lessons.. its not vy heavy but its not dat light either.. and so far, i've adhered to the schedule..930am and 930pm. On and off i missed a few times but so far, shouldn't be more than 6 times i believe.. 

its finally TGIF! but i'm still feeling exhausted for most part of the week. mr sandman hasnt been throwing enuf sleeping sand in my eyes. =s  why do i keep having insomnia? =(  i havent got anything on my mind datz really stressing me out.. or cld it be my sub-consciousness? 

i've no concrete plans for the weekend as my boo will haf appointments so we'll haf to work around it.. 

sleepy desu sho!"

"event","last sat, we organised our first BBQ at our place... it was a random date. cos everytime we wanted to book the pit for a specific date, its always taken up. =s  so this time round, we picked a random saturday and booked! haha! easier this way...

we chose the easy way out cos this time we ordered BBQ food that's already prepared and they delivered it to us at 5pm. only thing extra we did was buy prawns, de-shell the middle portion and skewed it. so dat pple will eat! haha.. otherwise most ppl wld not want to peel the shell.. >_<

we slept till quite late on saturday and then my hubbs wanted to go IMM look at furniture and electronics so we made a quick trip down.. almost reached home too late.. =p i had wanted to take a nap but too bad. got home abt 4pm and started doing the prawns.. ard 5+, the delivery man came so i went down to direct him.. and sat at the pit for next 2 hours. =_=

first guest arrived at 730pm.. and the cookout officially started! i thot the food for the evening wasn't too bad.. and our prawns were a surprise hit! must be the quality of the prawns cos all we did was butter it. simple yet nice!

we enjoyed ourselves dat nite...cos we finally had our BBQ! hahaha! at least before we moved over to the new place. =s

gee.. the new place.. well i'm not trying to sound ungrateful or wat.. we are indeed very blessed to be able to own 2 private properties before age of 30 (thanks to some help from his parents and <i>alot</i> of help from the bank. muhahaha! my liabilties are HUGE! altho all $ has to be returned eventually) 

as a risk-adverse person, i was initially reluctant of taking up another property. but he convinced me that since we had the leverage right now, we shld do it. otherwise in future, we will find it harder to buy or change property due to the heavy initial outlay. 

but the ultimate factor was for our unborn child. =)  for her sake and ours, i decided that we <b>had</b> to move closer to his parents as his parents will be the main care-giver most of the time.. we're lucky his parents are willing to take care too, hence saving us the worry of maid abuse etc. so bearing in mind of the distance and potential time saved, i felt it would be more sensible to move closer to them.. cos for the next few years, this will indeed save us alot of headaches.. not to mention costs. altho the new place is somewhere at clementi.. its still 4 mrt stops away from our current place at boon lay and a 15 min drive apart.

seeing how reluctant i was to move, he suggested leaving the baby in his parents' care during the weekdays and we bring her home during the weekends. as he would have appointments in the evening, he would not be able to send her home.. and if i bring her home myself it will be very inconvenient as i dont drive or even haf a 2nd car for dat matter. besides even if he can bring her home each nite, its not wise to carry baby back and forth late at nite too cos i dont wish for her to haf disrupted sleep.

i just find this idea quite ridiculous.. much as i relish my freedom, i feel its hardly responsible for me as a parent to see the baby only during the weekend. would i be the child's mother or will my MIL be the ""mother""? so i totally threw the idea out of the window.. as i found this unacceptable. so only alternative is to move over... altho if in the first place, had his parents and him be more decisive, his parents would be staying in the ground floor unit in our current block. dat will be the best! unfortunately.... =(

still very sad to leave current home.. =(  classic case of head vs heart. and the most annoying part is i find everything abt the current home much better.. layout, space, location.. sigh!!! must remind myself its for baby so i'll feel determined. shall avoid thinking about it for now... now i should only be concerned abt preparing for baby's arrival. =)

Andddddd......... on sunday i went for my jie lun's concert!! 
oh wat joy!! am really happs dat i got to attend his concert in the end... i can't describe the happiness i feel in my heart when i see him perform.. a mixture of happiness and pride in seeing him perform.. am also glad i shared it with our lil one.. she did move during his concert.. kekeke.. hope it wasn't too loud for her! =p

i took monday morning off, hoping to sleep in. but then, his parents were gonna collect keys for their unit at the new place.. so he wanted to bring me along... so i tagged along.. previously we already went to take a look as the agent had another unit of her client which TOP-ed first.. so this time round, it was to collect all the keys, documents, manuals etc. *phesssh* now they can start preparing for renovation. but i'll only collect my keys in sept.. =(  anyway i'll only move after my confinement which will be in nov.."

dilemma.. can't wait to ""pop"" so i can lose all the extra weight.. and yet i'll haf to take care of a little baby. *yikes* how intimidating! luckily i'll haf the help of my confinement lady (cross my fingers she dont put aeroplane), my MIL and my mum, together with some help from the maid. i think i'll rest as much as i can during the first 2 weeks.. really stay close to my bed except for nursing.

dat day i saw my MIL bathe my nephew and change him, she's really quite rough le...bit scared for my princess. =p  hahahaha! nephew never mind cos he's big and strong for his age and is a boy so a little bit of rough handling wouldn't hurt. but if its my precious princess, i would want her to be handled more gently! 

lately i've been feeling tired easily again.. wonder if its cos of my poor sleep or because its 3rd trimester again.. sian.. lately oso no mood to work. just keep thinking of taking leave.. my maternity leave is in another 3 mths or so.. sigh!"

normal weight gain for an acceptable weight person shld be around 11.3kg to 15.9kg.

erm.. i've reached the end of this range. FML. 2.5 more mths to go. 

but doncha think its interesting how much misc stuff ur body has to develop and store during this period? =p apparently the fats for breastfeeding is mostly stored in thighs.. my thighs are huge so dere better be more milk for my bb gal. hmph."

"event","as arranged, i met up with my mum at cityhall to go over to suntec for the singapore garden festival.. we settled our lunch at new york new york which was rather disappointing.. we both had the baked dory fish (more fish is good for bb!) after lunch, i brushed off the urge to haf dessert. =s  twice! once at new york itself and after dat, we walked past this ice cream waffle shop along citylink mall. =p

we went straight to the garden festival after that.. well.. if u asked me how the festival was? i'll say it was satisfactory... nothing wow-ed me.. but the flowers are mostly pretty! here are some two pics i took with my iphone.. the rest in camera. =)

love this pic... my mum looks uber happie!

i think we spent slightly more than 2 hours at the festival.. after the festival, we went for a break - had milo, tea and some butterfly, hum chee peng.. cos the fish we had for lunch was neither filling nor fulfilling. hehehe.. 

and then it was onwards for shopping!

and the first shop we went into, we stayed for an hr i think. =_=  incredelous? it wasn't a maternity shop but a shop selling floral casual clothes.. there were 3 assistants who kept passing us stuff to try.. i must haf tried 10 or more outfits.. it was quite a challenge to find stuff i can continue to wear for another 2 mths plus.. but in the end i did get 3 dresses and 1 top. =) happs! and my mummy got 2 dresses and 1 top too! 

the shopping did not end dere.... =p

we went to the 3rd level where there are shops selling kids stuff and bb clothes.. i went ahead and bought few more pieces for my lil gal.. courtesy of her grandmum! =)  i'll post up the pics tmr bah.. haven had time to take time yet.. i got a few long pants for homewear cos my mummy says at nite, better to let bb wear long pants.. and i bought them at a steal! bobdog brand.. 3 for $11! bargain or not? i'm not fussy about brands as long as it feels comfy and looks nice... after all, babies grow super fast! i did my spree at two shops spending $100 plus.. and i decided to stop. too much too fast. hahaha! still got another few mths to buy le.. and i dont wanna waste too much $ either.. but in my buys yesterday, the rompers i got were mostly for 3-6 mths as i feel no harm in letting her wear bigger ones cos she can wear them longer. rather than buying just nice... besides, my mum says if baby wears the diaper, their butt will be bigger.. so haf to get bigger sized pants too.. hahaha!

after a long day of walking, we finally settled our dinner at the foodcourt at about 8pm where again i had an unsatisfactory meal. =s  my hubbs came to pick us up close to 9pm.. sent my mum home first.. glad dat my mum enjoyed her day. =)

and he surprised me with a pandan chiffon cake when we got home... he had walked past the shop after having dinner and found the smell of the cake too irrestible so he got one. it was good.. i had 2 slices.. =p  fluffy and not too sweet!

******************************************

this morning i had a mini episode.. felt depressed over my weight gain.. i wore one dress and he commented it looked kinda tight.. so i was sad. suddenly overwhelmed with the weight gain issue... sigh... after i changed, he assured me that he'll buy more dresses for me.. i told him i dont want dresses.. =( i just wanted to be slim again.. i was so sad i even teared. (drama mama) he consoled me and asked me not to affect bb.. so i felt bad.. anyway can't blame bb.. cos i've got such a body type.. i can't expect myself to be slender cos i know i'm big-boned and belong to the more fleshy kind.. but at least to pre-wedding weight mah.. =(  any weight gain goes towards my arms and thighs first so i look even fatter. *PUI*

sigh.. trying to assure myself.. dat i've got another 2 mths plus to go only.. hopefully i can maintain my weight and any weight i gain now goes towards baby. i'm hoping not to tip over 20kg weight gain cos i'm close to it oredi!! FML. only consolation was ying did gain 20-over kg for her first pregnancy bingeing on durians and steamboat.. comparatively i haf a more normal diet.. i never over-eat like having 2 bowls of rice or 2 burgers dat kind. and ying is shorter than me by almost 10cm.. hahaha! is dat a consolation? aiya... i guess anything is better than nothing. 

oopsie.. BBQ this sat. o_0

"event","last nite i experienced painful aches again. =(

started feeling the ache more after dinner.. came quite suddenly.. the whole arm was aching from the shoulder downwards to the wrists. it felt so sore... i applied yoko yoko before i slept.. but in middle of nite, my wrists ached more so i woke up to apply more.. throughout the nite, i can only just lie flat with my arms at the side.. any awkward positioning of my arm would only make the ache more painful.. 

its not funny.. it really aches till point of pain (altho still quite bearable if u've got my threshold and if u compare it to.. a broken arm? hahaha..) its not those usual aches datz for sure... thankfully after applying yoko yoko, the aching areas warmed up and i was able to sleep.. altho i still had to take care not to move my arms around.. 

this morning it still ached so i applied more yoko yoko.. and right now, the aching pain has more or less subsided. *phew*  ytd my man came home late.. and when i woke up to apply the yoko yoko for the 2nd time, he felt bad for me cos he couldn't take over the pain. =p  sometimes i can't help feeling pitiful.. hahaha! but true mah.. initially it was the morning sickness discomfort, puking and now the aches. usually this sort of self-pity will pass in time cos i'll forget till the next time when it arises again.

was telling pj dat after this round, i really dont feel like gg through pregnancy again... =_=  but she told me i'll soon forget all the things i go thru.. hahaha! perhaps.. =p  was thinking if we try for another 2nd one, we'll wait till dragon year bah.. let me rest for at least a year or more.. anyway leave it up to fate.. see how we feel then. 

i'm on half day leave today, accompanying my mommy to the garden festival.. =) happs.. cos i can go shop.. walk around.. and some time with my mommy.. haven been accompanying her much. =s  but i'll haf to take cab home tonight.. train communters hardly give up seats to pregnant woman.. no one has given up to me yet. (>_<)

everyday i rush to get off work on the dot at 6pm.. cos from eunos, i still haf the chance to board a train with empty seats at eunos if i reach the station by 615pm latest.. after dat, the trains usually are more crowded.. so i get to sit all the way back home to boon lay. and in the morning to work, i take 2 stations backwards to joo koon (last station) so dat i can get a seat all the way to eunos. sian hor?  i know its silly but i hate the feeling of having to look for seats and awkwardly waiting for ppl to give up seats to me.. so i rather take cab home. =p  anyway will probably do quite bit of walking today so i dont wanna take train back either. see if my man can pick me up this evening.. see if he got appt.

2 more hours to freedom for the day!"

new hello kitty items i bought! actually i'm not an avid hello kitty fan.. its a coincedence if it happens to catch my fancy and it happens to be hello kitty. hahaha!

bought these from JB at watsons in holiday plaza. the boxed item is pantyliners! disappointingly the pantyliners inside had no kitty imprints, merely pink. oh well i can use the box to store my other pantyliners in future. and the other is a mascara from loreal! gothic kitty!

and a new hp casing which was too ""happy"" to resist.. just looking at the case makes me cheery. =p

"event","last fri i was off! and so my weekend started off on thurs evening... =)

and i was happs cos he met me for dinner on thurs nite.. we went to east coast park for dinner.. at some char-grill alfresco restaurant.. prices were reasonable and the food nice! so it was sort of a romantic nite.. long time since we went for a stroll at east coast! nice evening.. =p

on fri morning, i woke up at 540am! why? cos he was gonna send his maid back.. she had decided to go home for good. =s  so me, him and his mum went to the airport with her.. too bad morning was bit rushed so we could not haf breakfast with her.. =(  she has been with his family for 2 years.. so since i've been with him longer, she's always been someone i know.. she's gentle and obedient.. and after we got married, she helps with the chores at home.. altho she's slow but we still consider her a good helper. was quite sad to send her off.. for one, she is familiar with the chores and she's guai.. never gif much trouble.. i bought her some stuff..din know wat to get for her.. so got her practical stuff like a hairband, nice scruchie (cos i notice she wears them at home) and a nice side clip studded with some bling. on hindsight, i shld haf gotten her a bag hor. hmm.. anyway his mum gave her clothes and he gave her a mini cd stereo player (one which he won previously but never used) i think she is one of the more doted on maids. aiya.. anyway i oso teared abit when i see her enter the departure gate. =p

after sending her off, we had mac breakfast.. after which, we sat for bit cos it was kinda early..had to accompany the man to run some errands like dropping off his tailored pants for alteration, returned something to his client. then we went home to pick his dad up, went for lunch and went for some ""exploration"". was quite disappointed with wat i saw.. =s  definitely current one's better. anyway the topic's for another day!

we sent his parents home.. then went into JB cos he wanted to cut his hair.. so i accompanied him.. then he went for his massage and i went for my mani and pedi! he dropped me off at holiday plaza and went to his regular massage place.. erm.. quite alright cos its a fri so not too quiet at holiday plaza..din feel unsafe or wat. my nails were done in about the same time as his massage. =) so he picked me up and we went to a famous fishball soup place for late dinner! i love how cheap nails can be done across the border! =p we went home after dinner as we had a long day oredi... thankfully no jam! we were out for almost 18 hours straight.. so i was damn shagged.

in contrast, saturday was a relaxing one.. we woke up late am.. had late breakfast at home.. and i felt bit indigestion at the ba zhang i had so i took another snooze from 2-330.. =p woke up for a swim/dip with him... changed and left for dinner at his parent's place... after dinner, we left for the movie ""inception"". BOY! was it gooood!! i mean the whole idea of the movie was pure genius! i loved it.. =) definitely one of the better shows i've watched this year.

sunday was also quite relaxed.. again woke up late.. almost noon in fact. hahaha! had late breakfast again.. crashed infront of the tv... when it was 2pm, he went down to da bao some lunch.. prata! yums! we had late lunch... i snoozed again for abt half hour while he did some work.. woke up and prepared to go my parent's place for dinner... was at my parent's place till abt 845pm.. as usual, my mum whipped up a feast. 6 dishes and 1 soup. =_= sigh... still prefer own mummy's food. =)  kinda used to my MIL's food but then its never the same as own mummy's. kekeke!

i took wed PM leave this week cos my mummy wants to go to the singapore garden festival.. so i'll be gg with her cos she seems keen. so i'm pretty happy.. hee hee..

oh my BIL and SIL will be back today midnight.. along with the nephew.. he has grown so much! chubby chubby one! kinda miss him too.. even tho i admittedly can't say i like my SIL ( i mean she's ok but my verdict of her character is not out yet) , my nephew sure is cute! hahaha!"

"event","suddenly the whole idea of parenthood seems daunting today.. once again, the expected responsibility and scarifices that is to come seems too close for comfort. too real.

are we really ready? i think most parents-to-be are not until the baby is out and even so, parenting has no sure-fire formula. =s so its all about trial and error.. and its really happening to me, to us. gosh.

even though everything seems super challenging, i'm sure there's a rainbow to it all.. looking at some of my frens' fulfilling faces.. despite the many types of scarifice, i dare say 99.999% of them would have no regrets.. i hope to be in this group. hahaha!"

"event","dunno why lately for the past week or so (or as far as i can remember) i haven been sleeping well.. having some sort of insomnia or wat. grrrrr... 

every nite, i'll try to be in bed by 10pm so i can fall asleep by 11pm. my alarm is supposed to ring around 640am to 7am depending if i am taking a ride from hubby. so i get about 7 hrs of sleep thereabouts.

however due to the toilet visit frequency, my sleep is often interrupted.. the first few hours of sleep usually better cos i'm tired from the previous days.. and then when i get up to pee around 4am or 5am, i haf difficulty falling back to sleep. i'll be tossing around till the alarm rings. SUX. and i think i disturb him when i toss around too.. hee.. 

ahh.. i wanna haf better sleep!"

"event","hahaha! i must do a weekly post as such every week.. to mark each week's arrival.. and being closer to the ""finish"" line. =p

bb is still as active and sometimes makes wriggles dat make my insides cringe in a ticklish way.. =) she is getting more responsive.. if i tap my tummy and call out to her, sometimes she responds with a kick. cute! but of cos depends on wat she's doing inside.. right now i think they sleep almost the whole time except each sleeping routine varies.. can just fall asleep for 5 mins and be awake again, intermittent sleep. 

and when i use the babyplus, i can feel her move more.. her movements are larger too.. sometimes i can see the babyplus move up and down cos she's moving too much. which is of cos good.. i guess its her way of responding to the ""lesson"". i assume she enjoys it... hahaha!"

"event","my bb gal weighs abt 830 grams now! =_=  above avg at this point... avg weight shld be abt 600-650grams.. altho weight estimation is not accurate at this point (cos they use head circumference as a gauge) but its worrying!!!

and nurse told me i'm putting on weight too fast! 4kg in the past mth! gosh i din know... i blame it on the 2 boxes of durians i had at the end of my 5th mth.. sobs! i really haven been gorging myself.. or snacking all the time.

could it be the type of food i'm having? too much carbo or sugar in my diet? i really dunno wat i shld eat lo.. =(  

i'm quite worried cos i dont wish for bb to be too big else i'll haf to do a c-sec. and i'm worried abt the weight dat i'll haf to lose... SOBS!

so starting from today, i'm weaning myself from ice cream or sugared drinks. even fruit juice.. cos fruits have high sugar content too.. i shall just take fresh fruits.. no fruit juices either.. only liquids i'm gonna take will be milk, soya bean milk and plain water from now on.. maybe the occasional milo, tea and coffee. no more snacks like biscuits too.. =(

shall cut down on carbo too... shall haf less carbo like subway and delifrance but stick back to economical rice.. i just eat less rice.. or haf more cereal.. wholegrains.

sigh..."

"event","the bag first! hahaha! the bag one has to bring to the hospital.. kekeke.. the rest is bit hard to be prepare for.

My EDD is 26/10/10 but i just thot it safer to prepare the overnight bag soon.. perhaps in another mth or so? just suddenly remember abt it.. 

hmmm.. still finding all these bit unbelievable.. dat we're welcoming our baby soon... such a strange feeling at this moment. i might just bawl my eyes out! cos nowadays i'm oso quite emo.. tear at every touching thing. >_<

din expect myself to move on to this stage of life so soon... but i guess since it'll be in the pipeline, its only a matter of time. 

and truth be told, i'm seeing the advantage of delivering before i'm 30.. 

currently at 24wks2days,

- i'm experiencing tiredness once more.. i prefer to be in bed by 10 as i take some time to fall asleep. 

- body aches like wrist aches, buttache. yes. buttache.. wrist aches cos of some nerve thing.. it's an effect of pregnancy too. so nowadays i find myself applying yoko yoko in the middle of the nite. =_=  but by next day, i'm usually fine le.

- clumsiness. i'm beginning to waddle like a penguin. slightly. hahaha! haf to remind myself to walk more normally.

- feeling tired physically.. like after walking for some time or carrying stuff. i feel the strain sooner.. =s

still, i've finally realised dat its not dat bad to be preg.. =) dont really know how to describe.. in spite of all the bodily side-effects.. its pretty sweet. no wonder i had a fren who said she misses pregnancy. 

perhaps i feel i'm doing something really miraclous? dat i'm able to bring a child to this world? mebbe bah..  =) 

but check with me again once my lil one is out! hahaha!"

"event","yea! officially in the 6th mth!

same day as kvan's actual 1 year old bday! =)

felt baby kicking away early this morning... am glad to feel her movements.. but sometimes when i wanna sleep, it can get bit exasperating. hahaha! cos sometimes she kicks quite hard these days and she can make 2 movements at 2 different places.. perhaps i'm feeling both her hands and feet. and it can get quite ticklish. hee hee.. but of cos still cute! =)

sigh... so many mixed feelings! want to see baby soon but it'll also be initimidating.. and the pain of delivery? oh manz... better not think abt it. hahahaha! but fact is baby is to come out!"

oh and i also got it wrong! the <b>first</b> item i got for our bb is actually this pillow.. from japan! saw it and thot it was cute so decided to get it.. =) chose yellow cos we did not know the gender yet and i love the rainbow on it. anyway all colors have different designs and the yellow one happened to be be my fav. if i remember correctly, this small thing cost me almost S$30.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My diet

i'm so bored of eating outside food. =( no one to cook homecooked food for me. sigh... its just dat i'm so sick of thinking of healthy alternatives.. ntg much out dere datz really healthy.. and i still dislike soupy food. so the best choice are sandwiches. hahaha! i feel its healthier cos not oily.. has veg too! so nowadays my dinner diet consists of delifrance and subway. =p

my lunch is even worse.. less options. i'm often lazy to walk far.. and so , the only options are yong tau hau and malay food. some stalls i dont wanna patronise cos i feel the food sucks. 

nowdays i realise i crave desserts. like mango pomelo, ice cream, tau huey, canned fruits. hahaha! but its not a must-have item... i just happen to think abt it and feel like having it. i used to be like this even before i'm preg.. like if i suddenly recall i haven had this thing for some time, i'll wanna haf it. =)

*yikes* realised i've put on alot of weight. =(  double-digit! but of cos part of it is for baby, cos u will haf more blood and even ur thighs will store fats! breasts become heavier... and of cos the sac dat contains baby, the fluid.. and baby! =) i think my baby shld weigh something close to 500 or 600 grams by now? hahaha.. but damn, most of the weight is still on me! hmph!
sigh.. but now i'm less bothered in a way... ""resigned"" to it. shall work it off after pregnancy. in fact, my hubby has volunteered to sponsor me amore fitness. hahaha!

next gynae visit is this sat. =) can't believe it has been another mth... gonna see baby on screen once more! i better remember to ask doc how big is my baby this time round!"

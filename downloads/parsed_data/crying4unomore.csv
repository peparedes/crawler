"event","Today was my last day of orientation at AMDA. It was pretty cool. I got to go to a movie at the ArcLight for free, so that was nice. (Even if the three choices of movies I had were ALL movies I'd seen already). We had a choice of seeing either Pursuit of Happyness, Night at the Museum, and Dream Girls...I saw Pursuit again. It still made me cry...a LOT...my friend thought it was ""cute"". I thought I was being pathetic.

I've made new friends, friends I never would have expected to make. I've met some very interesting, whacky, deep, fun, funny, and interestingly enough, genuine people at my school. I think I'm gonna' fit right in here...

I've been spending a lot of time with a friend I made yesterday. Amber. She's really sweet, and we have a lot in common. It's been a long while since things have clicked right off the bat with someone. I can tell we're gonna' be really good friends. We walked around Hollywood tonight, cause she's still excited about the whole thing and wanted to take pictures. So I took her to the Kodak Center and The Chinese, and Ripley's, and all that other fun stuff that none of us from L.A. really care about. Although I do enjoy going to the Chinese.

I'm going to Disneyland on Saturday with Nichole, Jordan, and Amber...Should be interesting, and a lot of fun, I'm looking forward to it.

I miss everyone a lot. And I take comfort in knowing that I've got some of the most amazing people on this planet as close friends.

My love always goes out to everyone I don't get to talk to or see everyday. I hope everyone's doing well and having as much of an adventure as I am.

Good night.

"event","I'm really sad right now. Like, I feel really depressed.

All of my friends are gone. Everyone's going back  to college soon. I'm gonna' be here. Everyone that's closest to me is going to be hundreds of miles away, and we're all going to be so busy.

I hate working at the store here in L.A. It was FUN to go to work in S.F. Now, I feel like it's a chore, like high school felt.

I miss everybody so much. I kinda wish I didn't feel this way. I don't really want to be with everyone 24/7, but I think it's the fact that everyone's going to be so far away, and I won't be able to see them at all until next break.

On the other hand, I suppose time'll go by pretty quickly. I just remembered how much everyone means to me after seeing them all again, and being with everybody made me feel at home.

I'm just really going to miss everybody so much.

I love everyone so much."

"event","I'm writing my heart down in words,
On a brown paper verse,
So you and the world can know,
Of everyone in this universe,
No one can take me from this heartache row,
As long as it beats,
My heart will always be hers.

Tear away the pain,
And leave the rain to stir,
In the hearts of unwary travelers,
What was it you meant to deter,
From the eyes of this ever watching cur.


I put my heart in the hands of a fool,
A greater fool was I to believe it could overrule,
The messages I received, informing me of your betrayal.

You requested some patience, and yet more still,
I gave and I gave, and my never broke until,
I realized how much, I had let you play me for the fool,
And opened up my eyes, realizing I'd been such a tool.

I thought it could have worked,
Maybe just this once.
I gave the benefit of the doubt,
And believed every line.
Lines in the sense, of a cheesy pick up line.
Lines in the sense, that I now know, I'll never make you mine.

Cold winter nights, Christmas spirit in the air.
Lonely winter dream frights, chilled by all my despair.
You watched and let me leap,
Knowing I'd never fly,
Laughing, watching as I cried,
You decided to leave me forever floating there.

Now I see the true devil in your eyes.
The one that tricked me, into believing every one of your deceitful lies.
I thought you're feelings were true, and your heart in the right place.
I bought you a diamond necklace,
Which now would serve better as a neuse in its place.

It's funny, to think of it now,
How,
Quickly things can change.
What started as a letter of love,
Now has become,
A letter of pain."

IF YOUR LIFE WAS A MOVIE, WHAT WOULD THE SOUNDTRACK BE?
So, here's how it works:
1. Open your library (iTunes, Winamp, Media Player, iPod, etc)
2. Put it on shuffle
3. Press play
4. For every question, type the song that's playing
5. When you go to a new question, press the next button
6. Don't lie and try to pretend your cool...

"event","At this point, I'm not sure if anyone has time to even read these things...so i'm pretty much just using it for an actual journal for myself right now.

Sometimes I wonder why I am the way I am. I'm nothing like my parents, but I have qualities they both have. People don't usually understand me, or the way I think. and that's fine. for the most part. but it's hard. People said that I'm easy, or I move too quickly, I act without thinking. So I slowed down. I changed...Again. Now I don't move too quickly, but everyone seems to be passing me by while I wait for someone, who's...probably just using me. And what scares me is that I feel so alone that I'm willing to punish myself by subjecting myself to it. I'm not trying to make myself a victim here. I'm perfectly aware of my actions, and that I'm responsible. But that's just the thing. It's like I don't care anymore.

She gives me a reason to care...but...i can't tell if it's real or not. It's like ever since Sophie I haven't been able to let anyone in. I know it's because I'm too scared of getting hurt again...I used to believe that if something's worth while, it's worth the risk. That it's what we do, we jump and hope to god we can fly. I jumped.

I'm falling. And she isn't giving me wings.

It's like i'm falling and just being stuck in limbo with nowhere to go. I'm waiting for her.

waiting for her to grow up (maturity)

waiting for her to say she wants me.

waiting for us to not be ""just dating until you get back to L.A.""

I know it's not fair to put presure on her, so I don't. I don't ask her something I know she can't give me.


commitment.

i thought it was the guys who were supposed to be affraid of commitment.

what's really scary...is that i'll keep on waiting for her.




because I love her.



the question is...

Will I wait forever?

(Will I lose my dignity? haha, had to...it just came into my mind.)

Love is killing me.
Really. I'm really dying this time. Why can't she see what she's doing to me?

Please give me wings so I can fly..."

Most, MOST, of my friends are havin an awesome time in college as well. My parents are doing relatively well, no girl problems. just a little confusion, but that's to be expected. we can't wait to see eachother, but we don't want to get too involved because of the distance between us. but we're okay with just friends for now. XD I'm being creative again, my artwork's comin' along, my poetry's back in business, and I'm busy as hell like every single damned day. but i love what i'm doing. it's just tiring me out a lot.

I really do miss just hanging out with my friends from high school. which is why i'm looking forward to winter break, for at least one day, the gang'll be all back together again.

i've been trying to open up more as a person. reach out and make new friends. which is something i haven't had to do...well, ever. my friends always came to me first. for the most part anyway. but i'm happy about it. i think it's making me a better and more well-rounded person. it's just hard for me. i still have to work through that damn shyness i never really got over.

my romantic side has died down. which is a good thing. it's still there, just not as persistent, shall we say. she thinks it's good. i think it's good. it's all good.

everyday, i'm looking at life from a different perspective, and it just keeps getting better. i haven't really had a lot of depressions lately. and it's definitely a change.

it's scary...

i really don't know where i'm going to be in three years.

i used to always think i'd know.

now...

now, sleep time it is. for the force, waits not.

My closest friends are the only ones who are able to see it, and they can't do anything about it. It's eating away at me. I try to occupy my life. I take advantage of all I can. But I can't seem to find what i'm looking for. It's like no matter what i do. i'm constantly in this limbo of wanting something i just can't seem to have. i have dreams of a happy life. with someone. someone i've never met. someone, i don't know if i'll ever meet.

i lost my conscience when i left L.A. Mark was always there when i needed to have a deep philosophical discussion. he always had answers. he always pointed me in the right direction. i've been losing touch with so much of what my life was. and connecting with things that now, my life is. when i look up at the sky at night. i see even fewer stars than i used to. and instead of feeling bigger, i feel even smaller. i want to make a difference in people's lives, but can't.

if i could re-live my life. or even just watch the moments that have slipped through my fingers as i've grown up. i would. not to change anything. but to be able to remember ever little thing.

who was i when i was five years old?

who am i now?

all i know, is that i'm definitely not the same person.

why do i always feel like i shouldn't have been born in this world?

"event","what's with this?

not too long ago, i was in a place in my life where i didn't want to be. i was depressed, stressed, and always worrying about something. i couldn't find a job, no matter how hard i tried, my parents kept sending me money, even though they didn't HAVE any, and my love life...pretty much sucked. I tried so hard to just stay, not happy, but content, with what i had. and i tried to keep my hopes up, that eventually, EVENTUALLY, things would change. they finally started to. i got out of bed every morning, and found a reason to smile. and now, i don't need to find one, i just do.

sali's in that place. the only difference between us, is that she's been in that place her whole life. wondering when things are gonna' change, and finally get better. i alwas feel so helpless. I can't MAKE her see life differently, or that the changes she wants to see happen need to start with her own self. i can't show her how everything is completely in her control. all i can do is listen, try to give helpful advice, and be as good of a friend as i can. but always feel so horribly for her. she's probably one of the closest people on this planet to me. she knows more about me than i do. but i can't help her. i've never been able to. i want to cry, but can't. i don't believe in God, but i pray for her. I know she's not going to change, but i try to help her anyway.

we were talking about how i was 14 and she was 13 when we met. she couldn't wrap her mind around it. it was so baffling to her. we've known eachother for almost five years now, and we've been through a lot together. not in the sense that we've both experienced the same things. but we've been right there for eachother the whole way through. through thick and thin, for worse or for better. i used to love her. i still do. but in a different sense now. i know i can't pursue a relationship with her because we're too different. but she's my soul-mate. it's strange, but it's true. we're perfect friends. we've grown so close to one another that we're more than that. we're actually siblings. we've only known eachother for about five years, but we know eachother's lives inside and out. we did grow up together. and i think that's why it makes it so hard for me to see her going through all of this.

what's wrong with me? why do i always feel like i have to rescue everybody. i should know by now that no one really wants to be rescued. the human race is flawed in it's own design. we like to complain and make people hear our problems. the worse the problem is, the better the story we get to tell others. it's like we love to soak up all of this, strange energy others give off when we're depressed in between a hard spot and a rock.

not only is sali having shit to deal with, my girlfriend had a shitty day. and now she's being distant, and i can't do anything about that either, because we're already in a long-distance relationship. it's hard enough being far away from one another. now she has to do this. it's not that i'm mad at her. i'm mad at myself, for not being able to help her. for not being able to help sali, or my parents.

i walked into my apartment today, and found my room mate crying and looking at photos. i've never seen him cry. tomorrow's his birthday. he's from a small town in Pennsylvania. in every aspect, he's a stereo-typical small town country boy. but he's honest, smart, out-going, funny, sweet, and caring. he's a really great guy. and he gives off this presence of strength, power. but to see him cry today. it made me realize how vulnerable we all really are. He really misses his family. he's EXTREMELY family oriented. tomorrow's his birthday, and the first birthday he's going to be celebrating without his twin sister, or his mother and father, and brother.

I often find myself thinking, ""i wish i could get them to see things the way I see them."" i know no one ever can. and i'm not saying everyone should be or think like me. i'm not saying that at all. but i think that my outlook on life, helps me get through things, that i wouldn't be able to get through if i looked at life the way these people do. i looked at life their way before. i got sick of it.

i changed it.

i changed me.

and as a result, my life has already begun to get so much better.

i don't know where this is going anymore. i'm going to close my lap-top now. and get into bed, and go to sleep. i will wake up tomorrow to a new day, and take on the world again.

i'm looking forward to it.

g'night world."

"event","I'm sitting in the laundry room. waiting for my laundry to get done. so i thought i'd update, which is something i haven't done in a while.

so, what's new...

my parents came up to the city this weekend to visit. they're going back to L.A. tomorrow. :( But I was really happy to be bale to spend time with them. My mum's been getting worse. she's getting depressed now. She's so tired of having to go throught her chemo sessions and then have it take everything out of her. that and she isn't getting any better. My pop's worried about her. She's a lot more quiet these days. I'm always worried about her, and i honestly have no idea of how much time i have left with her. i think she's considering stopping her chemo treatments. There's only so much we can do for loved ones before the rest is up to them. i feel so helpless watching her go through this. i try to be strong for her. but some days i honestly think it would just be best to quit school and go back home to L.A. and be with her. At least until she gets better. But i know she wants me to stay in school and that she's never been so proud of me. i feel like sometimes, even though i'm doing all this for myself, that maybe a lot of it is so i can have my mum see me accomplish something with my life. she never followed her dreams, and all my life she told me to do that, if i did anything. she wanted me to be a doctor, or a lawyer, for a while she wanted me to be a model. but she always told me what she really wanted was for me to follow my dreams, but to do it with all my effort and heart. to not half-ass it. my parents are my strength these days. i don't have many friends too close by. and i don't have a significant other to talk to. i spend most of my time with my pencil and markers in my sketch book. i've had a lot of writers block when it comes to poetry and music. but my novel is coming along really well. someone's been telling me how much they love me, and that i was the most amazing thing that's ever happened to her, and that she misses me so much. but i don't know what to do with that. i care about her. a lot. and it never used to bother me. but when i think of what my friends will say if they find out i've started seeing her again. it always seems enough for me to keep my distance. The thing is, none of my friends ever knew her that well. but anyway. i've been doing a lot with school lately. i'm gonna' be starring in 4 student films. I've got a play that i'm working on coming up Dec. 7th. school is amazing, as always. i really love it. I just got hired at Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and I start work this Friday. um...my band has me, on my clarinet, my room mate Roni plays bass, and our friend T.K. plays guitar. we don't have a drummer or a singer yet, and we don't have a name. Our music is like a mix of jazz and rock. we call it ""jock razz"". haha. um. yeah. i spend a lot of nights sitting on the pier listening to the water. it's relaxing. we had rain for like two days, it was amazing. i can't wait till it really starts to rain. i love the rain so much. but yeah. that's basically what's been up with my life. in case anyone's been wondering. for the most part i'm not depressed. i have it pretty good up here. it's just when i start thinkin bout my mum that everything starts to get unclear. but i know she wants me here. and i want to be here. so, i guess in some wierd way, i'm doing the right thing by staying here, in my mind. i hope it's the right thing anyway.

well, my laundry's done. night all.

"event","I watched Bladerunner again tonight. after watching it, i looked around me, and realized i lived almost exactly like Rick Deckard did in the movie. and i realized that if i were over 21, the bottle in my hand probably wouldn't be a sobe drink. i lay in bed and no matter what i do, the first image that pops into my mind when i close my eyes is her face. her smile when she loved me. i know it's long past due for me to move on. but i haven't met anyone that even comes close to her. i'm not looking anymore, but i'm not meeting anybody new, friend wise or other. i feel as if i'm curling up into a ball of seclusion and putting a lock around myself. i'm trying to just live my life, but i always feel like there's something missing. something i'm not catching. i don't know what it is, or if in fact, i have finally gone off the deep end. all day long nothing but stories of dragons, and goblins, and international espionage are floating through my head and never letting me rest. my mind is always racing faster than i can breath and i fear i'm losing myself again. i'm trying hard to hold onto what little bit of sanity i have left, but i'm not sure how long that'll last. i'd ask for a cure, but i don't know what's wrong. and even if i did, i doubt there'd be a cure. i don't even know what i'm saying anymore. at this point i'm just typing and i think i'm actually going to stop now and go to sleep. i've been having trouble sleeping the past couple of nights, but i'm feeling really tired tonight, maybe tonight'll be different. well. g'night."

"event","so, i've got a great new apartment, i finally have a steady job (which means steady pay check! woohoo!), i've got amazing classes, i live in ONE of the coolest cities in the country, and yet...something's missing. don't get me wrong, i'm not depressed, i just feel like there's something I'm not seeing, or experiencing, or something, that I should. but i dunno.

Lauren's stopped talking to me. Which made me really really sad. We've been friends since she was born. She knows me better than anyone on this planet, and i'd like to say the same vice versa, but i don't think i can. Which is sad. She's always been the closest person to me in my life. and i always seem to be stupid and let the best things go. even when i now i shouldn't. she's dating some imibicile who has pictures of her on his myspace with stupid quotations like ""damn she fine & she mine! i be a lucky mofo!"" or ""i'm supaman mufukaaaa!"". She stopped talking to me because her friendship to me somehow ""threatens"" him. I don't know much about him, but i don't like him. I dunno, maybe i'm being to quick to judge, i guess i just want her to have the best. But i'm not in a position ta give that to her. she seems happy, i suppose that's all that matters.

i'm done for tonight. i'm exhausted and it's been a long day. and i feel realy badly cause i think i missed a friend's birthday and didn't say happy birthday to them. I don't know who though, and i'm really sorry that i didn't at least wish them a happy birthday. well, good night world. tomorrow's always another day right?"

"event","My final days of vacation in L.A. are coming upon me.  Soon I'll be on a plane heading back for San Francisco. I didn't get as much done as I wanted to. I'm glad I got to see people one last time before we all venture out on our journeys into adulthood. I wish I could've seen more people and hung out longer...but alas, time is always against us. Being back in L.A. brought back so many memories, memories that surprisingly had been pushed to the back of my mind just from being in S.F. for two months. People I'd almost forgotten, places I used to love. And then I got scared. I realized...this isn't my home anymore. My home is S.F. At least for now. But this place, it's not home for me, at least not right now. Everywhere I go, I remember her. All of my memories of us, they're here, in this city...everywhere in this city. We went everywhere together. We did everything together. and now...i don't know. now i feel like this city isn't anything but a place for the ghosts of her and myself to linger, until they find their way again. I e-mailed her today. For the past month or so, I've been thinking about her more and more. I miss her. I don't miss what we had, what we were, or miss just being in a relationship. I miss her. Just as I'm going to miss everyone here once we're all really off on our own. I wanted to call her, hear her voice again. But I'm not ready for that. and besides, I figured an e-mail was better. That way she has a choice of if she wants to talk to me or not. If I call her it's kind of not giving her any alternatives. I guess it's up to her now. Whatever happens, I tried, to keep at least our friendship alive. I just really don't think i'm ever going to find anyone like her. or at least anyone who wants to be with me. the last person i dated was...well...insane. i just can't find a way to stop thinking about her. missing her. and being in L.A. hasn't been helping. I'll be glad to be back on my way home. But I truly will miss everyone dearly. this is the end of one chapter of my life. hopefully it'll put the rest of my life in perspective. here's to what hasn't come to pass yet.

good night, never good bye"

"event","A lot has happened over the past four years. Loves have come and gone, friendships have ended, formed, and grown. Fights have been settled. Tears have been shed, shoulders have been leaned on. And we've all made realizations about our lives, together and apart. I've made bonds with people that will NEVER be separated, no matter how far in time and space we grow apart. And I've lost connections with people I will still always care very deeply about. I realized today that I really miss some things. I miss:

Yeah. A lot has happened, and a lot has been put into my journey that's taken me to where I am now. I'm sittin in a room, in the middle of Downtown San Francisco, California. I'm reminiscing of all the magical moments that are like snap shots in my head and they all fit together to make a portrait of my life so far. Friends past, friends new, friends who stayed strong, and we always knew, we'd stay together.

I had a wonderful evening tonight, and it was ended PERFECTLY. I went to an art gallery with my new friends (all of whom are over 21 except my room mate, Roni) After the gallery, we went for pizza and beer. It was wonderful, and...new...different...I started to realize that I'm actually starting a new life up here, and the friends who will most likely be spending the holidays with me and my girlfriend in the future, will be these people. And I almost started to cry. I know I'll never lose certain ties that I've made with people in L.A. But none of us know for sure that they'll be around where I am. Not to say that they should be, just that they most probably won't be. And at dinner tonight, we were already planning our ""Thanksmas"" holiday. It takes place in between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we ALL get together, everybody brings food and presents and cooks, and we all sit down at a HUGE table and feast and drink, followed by much music making. and we all dress up and spend the night. I know it'll be fun. I guess it's just un-nerving because I always imagined I'd be doing this kind of thing with my other friends. And it's like I have a completely different life up here. People respect me and treat me as an adult, and I can actually relate to everyone on a psychological level, as opposed to just those few friends I really connected with back in L.A. 

I felt lost once...now I just feel as though I've lost something. I've gained something in return, but part of me if very sad. I think back to when I didn't worry about expenses, bills, how much I was drinking so I could walk back to my place, what time I had to set the alarm so I could get to work on time. I think about how whenever I needed a friend who was so much more than a friend, they were actually family, not only could I call them, I could drive to them.

Things will NEVER turn out the way we think they will. They may be worse, they may be better. But I've realized I don't WANT to know what's gonna' happen. I don't want to know if that huge earthquake we've all been expecting is gonna' hit today or tomorrow. I don't want to know if Rebecca and I are gonna' make it. I don't want to know if I'm ever going to actually have two kids, a loving wife, a husky, and a stable in the back full of horses and a vinyard.

I just want to know that I'm going to wake up tomorrow, and that it'll be a brand new day, full of new adventures, and new people. I want to know that tomorrow isn't a step closer to the end of my life, but the first day to the rest of my life.

I keep people dear and close in my heart, and they're there when I need them. I suppose we all come to this realization one day or another. It's just a matter of when. When we wake up one morning and realize everything's perfect, we have a loving partner, a great job, a smile on our face, and a reason to get our ass out of bed every day. I'll always miss what was, but I'll always look forward to what wil be; the un-expected, the un-known, the exciting, the beautiful, the sad, the wonderful, the hateful, the happy. The future.

It's one a my FAVORITE movies! lol. if i could be ANYONE, it would be Dick tracy. HE'S my idol, (not countin my pop a course, he's always first). but yeah, back to tha movie! weeeeeeeee!"

"event","Rebecca/Rebbeca caled me. She thought we were going to the movie tonight, and she had already bought her ticket. So I changed and went over to the theatre. She brought a friend, Hannah, who's from England. Hannah needed to ""go to the restroom"" during the movie. Right after she did, Rebecca/Rebbeca put her head on my shoulder. I wasn't sure what to do. I didn't mind it, but it made me feel uncomfortable at first. I don't mind her age. But for some reason, everyone I know, save for my parents and immediate family, kept popping into my head and ""looking down upon me"" as if to say, ""she's too young, stop being stupid! you're acting like a pedophile"". And then she wrapped her arms around mine. I didn't do anything. I just sat there, watched the movie, and let her rest head on my shoulder. It felt right. Nothing's felt that right since...well, for a long time. We had a good time. And her friend seemed to ""approve"" of me, I only bring it up because it seemed to be a big deal for her friend. She's got a beautiful smile. It's honest. It's real. I think that's what I like about hanging out with her. She hasn't been corrupted by high school and all that typical bull shit we all go through yet. And it's been a while since anyone's told me that they had a really good time with me and I believed them. She's flyin out to Michigan on Saturday to see her dad. She'll be back after summer's over. Course she's gonna' be in Pleasanton, and in high school...If anything, I've gained a new friend, and it's nice, she's like the friends I had back in L.A. Maybe it's just nice to have something remind me of what it was like befoore everything changed. before my life got flip turned upside down and the paint on the walls of my mind dripped all over the ceiling and opened up the doors. She said she'd call, and that she'd e-mail every day. It's okay if she doesn't. But for some reason I believe her. I'm glad I can start building this friendship. For right now that's all it is. That's all it can be. but mabe one day it'll be more. Who knows? Who wants to?

Enough of that. Beach and rock climbing photos! YAY!!!! me n' my buddy/room mate Roni went to ocean beach. it kicked ass!

By: Mick Feinman

I was bit today, in the neck...by a girl, with a vampyre fetish. don't get me wrong, she's cute, she's hot, she's nice...she's got issues, way too many for me to deal with. And she still has quite a bit of growing up to do. If you met her you'd understand. she gets turned on when I wear all black, slick my hair back, wear black eyeliner and lipstick, and my blue contacts and fangs...vampyre fetish. I dress up like that sometimes when i go to the club on Vampyre Night. it's fun. it's like a second Halloween. she scares me...of what i might become. when she bit me, I pusher her away and told her to stop. But it wasn't because i found it disgusting or painful or anything like that, like I used to believe I would. It was because it turned me on and it scared me. i wanted to bite back, and squeeze, and bite her lip...and taste her blood. Images I never want to see again flashed in my mind. Images like the ones you only see in movies. and it made me thirsty, it made me horny. It made me scared out of my fucking mind. i have no idea who I was in that split second that I wanted her blood dripping from the corners of my mouth as she licked it off the side of my chin, and her nails digging into my back. I never knew I could be so horrified of anything in my whole life. I NEVER want to go back there. Ever. I'm not myself there. I'm IT. A thing. THE, thing, that people idolize, and lust over. A sex symbol for ages, a symbol of death, lust, thirst, excitement, danger, immortality. What would happen if I let it out?

By: Mick Feinman

I'm going out tomorrow night. with a girl named Rebecca/Rebbeca. (I haven't asked her how she spells her name yet.) She's a nice girl. sh'es beautiful. she's young...too  young. I'm doing my best to just do all I can to go about this as just a friend thing. i know it's wrong, but it feels so right. i know I won't do anything stupid (kiss her). But part of me feels as though i would wait for her, just for one kiss. Wen she's 18, i'll be 21. will that still be wrong? Would it only be okay once she's 21 and I'm 24? Or will it ever...COULD it ever be okay in societies eyes? I'm not hoping for or expecting anything sexual. I don't even want that. I like who i am when I'm with her...I'm me...and she likes who i am...But at the end of the night...it's still wrong? ...Yes...In the words of a great song; ""can't be bad, to feel so good"". Ahhh, good ol' Irving Berlin. I'd ask what people think i should do. And i know what they'd all say. and i know what my heart says, and what my mind is telling me. she lives in Pleasanton, it's about an hour away from the city. She's still in high shcool. She's only going to be a junior for cripe's sake. but i have so much fun with her. Pure, innocent, enjoyable, fun. there's nothing seductive about it, nothing sexual in any way. and yet, I constantly find myself asking; ""if she'd leaned in for a kiss...would I stop her? Would I do what's RIGHT?"" Or is she the girl I'vee been looking for? someone to just have a good time with, not necessarily something lon-term, just something, that maybe one day, could be long-term. But it's perfect the wy it is right noe. She makes me remember who I am. Maybe she's just someone I needed to meet, for myself. I'm gonna' try something different, I'm just gona' have a good time...we'll see what happens. (within the legal realm that is) ;)"

Ben Harper
<i>
Yes indeed Im alone again
And here comes emptiness crashing in
Its either love or hate
I cant find in between
Cause Ive been with witches
And I have been with a queen

It wouldnt have worked out any way
So now its just another lonely day
Further along we just may
But for now its just another lonely day

Wish there was something
I could say or do
I can resist anything
But temptation from you
But Id rather walk alone
Than chase you around
Id rather fall myself
Than let you drag me down

It wouldnt have worked out any way
And now its just another lonely day
Further along we just may
But for now its just another lonely day

Yesterday seems like a life ago
Cause the one I love
Today I hardly know
You I held so close in my heart oh dear
Grow further from me
With every fallen tear

It wouldnt have worked out any way
So now its just another lonely day
Further along we just may
But for now its just another lonely day
<b>

I've been trying out my new life. So far it fits...and that's what scares me. Life...where does it take us? and why? do we really have control over the choices we make? I know most of us like to believe we do. And I suppose that to some extent we do. But where does our control end?

We all go through life's ""slings and arrows"" and we all have our own troubles to deal with. how many times can we all fall completely apart, and put our hearts back togethr just feel the emptiness of the dark? I used to say I'm ""used to being alone"". I realized now. I'm not used to it. I'm comfortable with it. and it really scares me. I can't really truly explain my experience to anyone. But when I walk through union square, and i just stand there. everyone passes by me and they don't even notice me. i know there's not really any real reason for them to. but it's interesting. time really feels like it's slowing down for me. and i can analyze everyone and everything around me. like i was meant to be on the outside looking in. and then i see it. a smile across a girl's face. a true smile. genuine, full of happiness, content, excitement for the future...and the man who's eye's she's looking into. and her hand in his. then everything stops, and it's just them. and me. and they walk right through me. and as much as m heart is yearning, and wishing, and breaking...i know i'm fine. i don't want to be, but I am.

it's funny. i'll write journals like this, and i'll write with all my heart. but to anyone else reading this, it's all just a bunch of words on a screen. a random jumble of letters in a formation that really only makes sense to one person in the end.

my life...past, present, future...i know it's mine and mine alone. and that no other person could complete me. but what if someone could? who says we have to stop believing in something?

I could've fallen in love eventually...if I had asked her out.
But I didn't. She wanted me to. And I stopped myself.
It didn't feel wrong, but I was scared.

I hope this isn't what my life has come down to.

everywhere I go I see her. and after writing this...i only feel more fear.

fear of being judged. by people I know and care for. fear of them remembering the me they knew and thinking i haven't changed. but of course, how would they be able to tell...from just a bunch of words on a glowing screen..."

"event","i'm bored. so i'm gonna' write.

...

I don't have anything to write about really. I've realized that this has really just become a journal for me. I don't think I'm gonna' make my posts public anymore. I don't think anybody reads them anyway. I don't know if I want people to. Most of the time I'm just writing to write. I miss home. I spend most of my days pretty lonely. it was good for a while. But it'd be nice to see at least one of my friends once in a while. the whole party scene has kinda lost all of it's fun for me. I've seen every movie that's out, I've been to every part of the city, I've gone surfing, clubing, rock climbing, played football, ice skated, dated, gotten drunk, stayed up all night, gotten A's in my classes, lived completely alone. I'm bored again. Sometimes I wonder if I can ever be satisfied. It's not that I'm proud of that. I just need to figure out when I'll finally be content, like, permanently content. I want to travel the world, and i know I will, just a little slowly and a bit at a time. for the mean time, I guess I just have to make the best of what I have.

I don't know. guess I'm just tired. I'm gonna finish watching Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and then go to sleep.

good night world."

"event","everytime I've started to get close to someone up here, she pops into my mind, and I miss her more than anything. It's funny, when you finally TRULY lose someone, you realize how much they really meant to you, and how much you meant to them. I called her, and left her a message. That was three weeks ago. She hasn't called back. We grew up together. I saw her EVERY single day growing up, we made dinner for one another, she told me she loved me. i shut her out. I THOUGHT I was protecting her, maybe I was protecting myself. I cry when I hear Aladdin songs. She'll always be my Jasmine, but I guess she's found another Aladdin.

I'm tired.



I have class in the morning.



I want to take my knife and shove it in my heart to stop the pain, but just thinking about that makes it feel worse.



















after finding a place for evrything in my life, and getting my life together and on track. I realize that the ONLY thing I'm missing, isn't love, isn't sex, isn't dating...

it's her.

the only question is, how long ago was it that she actually left?


no more depressing shit.

I'm going ice skating soon! weeeee!

i can't wait, it's been so long.

I went to the beach the other day.

it was fucking awesome!

I went rock climbing up the cliffs, and surfing, and I played football in the sand.

It was so beautiful...

the water was friggin' freezing!

it was fun.

well, night all."

"event","wow...i never thought it would have ever gotten to this point. the point where I feel so disconnected and sepearate from all my friends i left in L.A. I know the whole sepearation thing has to happen. but i never thought it would make me feel like i don't have anything in common with any of them anymore. sometimes i want to talk to my friends, but it felt like whenever i called one of them up, they were kind of annoyed to hear from me. and in all honesty, i'm sure i can get pretty annoying sometimes. it's just wierd that im SCARED to call my friends. or people i thought were my friends. is this when i realize who my real friends were? are? i don't know. i know i feel like i'm turning into a completely different person. i've been out partying most nights, and it was pretty scary. i felt like Neo did in the first Matrix movie, when he was ""following the white rabbit"". my entire life is turning completely flip side, and i don't understand a lot of things anymore, but on the other hand, so many new things are opening up to me. i'm directing/producing/and acting in RENT this fall. so much fucking work, but i'm loving it. i wish i could call some people from L.A. and cast them in it, but i know that would be even MORE work, and i'm already not sleeping.

becca and i broke up, but we've become such close friends. she's just a little too...wild, for me. we broke up like a week ago. and i felt like i could be me again, which i know is a good thing. i was falling into another sand trap, and i'm glad i got out.

lately it's felt like time has had no meaning in my life. the days go by slowly, and i'm able to enjoy what i want to enjoy. it's almost as if i can just freeze time and move about on my own sometimes. it's kind of tripy...(i might still be riding on some of those shrooms...haha, nah)

this morning was a yucky morning. i woke up EXTREMELY in need of and lacking sleep, my head was pounding, and it was fucking FREEZING this morning. i felt like crap, while on the bus, i spent half of the ride staring out the window at the city passing me by, while i sat motionless. at one of the stops, a girl got on, when i looked at her walking up the steps, she just smiled at me. there wasn't anything to read behind it, it was just genuine kindness and a morning ""hey, how are ya?"" i couldn't do anything but smile back, no matter how shitty i felt. she sat down right next to me. (which is pretty odd, considering that most mornings, becca, roni, and I are singing RENT songs at the top of our lungs the entire bus ride, and scaring most of the high school students in the Summer Art Experience program. haha) and i just couldn't come to understand it, so i didn't, i just went with it for a change. we started talking, and the strangest thing happened. i wasn't tired anymore, my headache was gone, and i found that i couldn't stop looking at her, the wierder thing was that she didn't stop looking at me either. she got off the stop before mine with a ""i'll see you next week""

i have something else to look forward to...


okay, so if anyone who knows me is reading this, they're probably going, ""oh, he hasn't changed at all, he's still the same old, 'oh, okay, let's fall in love every other week Mick' "" but in all honesty, i didn't fall in love. it was just shocking to me, it was kind of a surreal experience I guess. course a lot is this days.

my life up here so far:

-went to the Death Guild (where EVERYBODY is gothic, and they all dance like fucking zombies, LITERALLY)
-got a girlfriend (who's bi, has a vampyre fetish, and is into bondage and s&m)
-broke up with the girlfriend (we're better off as just friends)
-got drunk off my ass one night and was stumbling all over the place (three girls who were with us that night were all over me and took care of me when i couldn't take care of myself. ""okay...these girls only like me cause i'm drunk...wrong crowd maybe?"")
-started writing a new script and book (like NOTHING i've EVER written before)
-started working on RENT (oh my fucking god, it's taking over my life! someone save me!)
-formed a band (we play a mix of rock and jazz. i play my clarinet in the band, it's awesome!)
-i'm moving into a new apartment with two of my new friends Roni and Andrew. (they're in the band with me)
-the RAVE (do i have to go into anymore detail? okay, i will. it was at the docks, or should I say UNDER the docks, it had about 300 people there, people were rollin on ecstasy, glow sticks were EVERYWHERE, and I felt like i was in a BLADE movie. it was fucking wierd and awesome at the same time)
-started a skate docmuentary down by Pier 1. (i never knew how much i enjoyed making docmuentaries)
-bought new roller blades (i've been tearing up the city with my friends who all skate board. i'd forgotten how much fun it is to blade)
-gotten the ENTIRE Final Cut Pro Studio (for FREE!) from my friends mac (i love macs!)
-almost gotten mugged by a guy while i was coming out of the movie theatres. he kept on calling me his ""nigger"" and started walking right beside me and wouldn't leave. i got scared, my heart was racing, and i felt my fists clench so hard it was like they had a mind of their own. i was ready to fight back, and i was hoping to god i wouldn't have to. i was more scared than anything. then he said he was going to count to five. i told him he didn't want any trouble and asked him to leave me alone. i stopped dead in my tracks and looked him straight in the eye. (probably not the smartest thing to do when you're about to get mugged by the way) but i don't know what happened, or what he saw, but it was like he pissed his pants, and he simply backed off and walked away. i was walking for about fifteen blocks before my hands finally unclenched. i was bleeding from my palms. my hands were clenched so tightly that my nails had started to dig into them.


yeah. it's been a pretty fucking wierd experience. but it's been my life. and i realize that all of this is sill just molding who and what i'm going to be. i'm scared for the first time in my life. i really DON'T know who i am."

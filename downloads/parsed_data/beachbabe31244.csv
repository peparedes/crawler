"event","Well my last journal entry had mentioned that I had seen Bubba that weekend before. Just reading that kind of upsets me knowing the last journal entry I wrote in a while had mentioned the one person we all have recently lost. Its like I find myself fighting to hide the missing feelings for him. i just dont know how to cope missing such a caring, fun loving, life of the party guy. Who has been my friend for so many years. Its just still unbelievable that he is the one who is gone. i guess all i can really say is i miss him alot. 

Well I guess I could update my journal on some of  the things that has been going on in my life. A month and a half ago I had gone out with a kid named Theo. Who is still around in my life which is the sucky thing because I see him all the time he works with me. Well I am now going out with an amazing guy Scott who at first I really could say I didnt care about at all. He was just a rebound from when Theo and I broke up, but he has grown on me now. At first I could say i would of broken up with Scott to be with Theo again if it was possible, but it has changed now im not even sure what i would do i would probably just stay with scott. I mean I cant say that i still dont miss the thought of how me and Theo were, but just seeing him sometimes and just looking at him kind of upsets me. I start to think well i wonder how being with him right now and that much longer down the road how it would of turned out if I wouldnt have fucked up. Would we stay together? or would we still have broken up? I guess i will never know. 

Life: What to actually say about that subject who knows anymore. What is it actually holding for you? Is it just to create you a lesson before you meet the big man or is it meaningless  you find out in the end. I know im rambling, but I feel like i have so much to get off my chest and by rambling maybe ill come up with one of the things to get off my chest. Works getting hectic since everybody is going off to school and I am picking up more hours We only have 2 managers left and everybody is suspecting dave picking up and leaving after his wedding in september but who knows? Jimmy just got back from his vacation and I have been planning on asking him for a raise, but I think i need to bust my ass for a little bit before I ask him. School: I havent spoken to my father in a while I dont know if he has been getting my emails at all he is supposed to be sending me money for a car so I can have a way of getting to school and back. Thats why I will be going back and starting classes in the spring. My 19th birthday is a month away pretty much which is pretty awesome since it is on a Friday this year. Well enough with all my rambling  I just thought I would post since I havent posted in a while."

"event","Well come to find out ive done something wrong this weekend and I cant tend to find what I really did wrong. People are hating me for all the wrong reasons and I seriously would like to be filled in, but thats kind of hard knowing these people wont speak to me. I am hoping we will be able to work things out and sit down and talk about things, but it doesnt look like thats going to happen. Whatever they think i did I guess i will say sorry  for one person said i was talking shit about her when thats totally not true when her name didnt even come out of my mouth once and if it did it wasnt in a bad way at all. The other says I have going on things that i have ""heard"" which I really dont understand whats going on.It upsets me that they wont even listen to me, tell me what I have done wrong, and hear what I have to say about it, but i guess I cant really change anything about there choices. I guess I might be experiencing my father alone instead with the one person i wanted to share the experience with and the one person I wanted to be there with me. 

Well lets just say this weekend was quite the blur. Friday night went to Matt's house saw Bubba after the longest time, and met some of the unknown people Chrissy talks about. I found myself getting totally fucked up after 1 xanny and a crap load of beer. Hanging out with some of the older brothers friends and having them yell ""Little Thiess"" all night. 

Saturday night found myself getting wsted at 6. At Alli's like usual for Alli's 18th birthday party kind f thing. It was supposed to be a surprise but she ended up finding out  about it. So i was wasted at 8 probably even before that. Saw Jeremy Kubiak which was quite a surprise knowing i was so wasted i saw him and ducked in the other room. At the end of our little fiasco i ended up being nice and saying hi. Played flip cup for the first time which got me wasted fast and then some games of Beer pong screwed me over. Chrissy and I ended up leaving from Alli's at 10 and decided to go to Oyster Pub to meet up with Shane for his birthday shit. Saw Jonny, Jmac, and Tony there ate some food. Ended up hanging out with Shane, Boswell, Brett, Walker, Jim, and the rest of the group for the rest of the night at Oyster Pub until 2 decided to go to Frank's and that was boring so we thought the club was going to be boring but knowing that chrissy's Brandon was inside the whole time bummed her out the next day. Left at 2 and got home by 3 passed out. The next day woke up at 10 went to the mall, ate, and then came home. That was my interesting weekend even though there is more to it in details anyway but no need to worry about that. 

Well I guess ill be on my own or feel that way for a while. i really dont know what I do or what i did but im really sorry for whatever you think i have done. 
im out."

"event","I do understand if I do write something in here offensive or something that bothers you please dont take it personal its just how I feel and  what goes through my mind. Certain people in my life are doing certain things I dont approve of, but all I can do is sit back and watch them do it. It all comes down to 1 thing. coke. Ive seen people do it, Ive heard about people doing it, and ive talked about people doing it. I never realized how bad the drug can be and how it can bother me until I realized even my closest most favorite people in the world have experienced it or are doing it. I feel like im the outcast becuase I havent done it and I dont want to do it. I am also scared im going to be suckered into it or im going to see one of the people I love do it and im just going to crack and fall and thats going to be the end. Finding out made me upset and crazy ripping things off my walls taking pictures out of frames and just laying on my bed room floor pounding it and crying histerically. Becuase you always thought that those people who were so close to you wouldnt do something like that and it just stuns you. I was just hoping that I was going to wake up in my bed and it was all going to be just a bad dream, but it wasnt. Thinking that the person you know who always told you that they were going to prove everyone wrong and not do it was amazing to hear that they actually did. People I have met that I know have done it before doesnt upset as much as someone I have known for many years that say they are never going to do it and they actually end up doing it just is disappointing. I feel like in the circle of my closest friends im being shut out and im about to be pushed out just because i dont do it. i feel like i just need to get out of this town and get away for a little bit and the trip to Costa in 24 days will do that for me. Just being in paradise will be the best thing i will need. Certain people wh influence and sit there and let and watch people do it like shawn Carpenter sickens me. Hes just a complete piece of shit. That drug ruined his life and made him into the piece of shit he is today only caring about himself and his feelings not caring at all about anybody else but him self. Just worrying about who can get him drugs and fucked up. Thats what he calls his friends. Just the drug makes you into  totally different person than you were before it alters your beliefs and actions of your everyday life. i just feel like I cant do anything about it and im just stuck in the pit and nobody is coming to get me and im trying to claw myself out. 

Well this weekend was nuts not so much Friday, but Saturday was. Jill came and picked me up went to Al's. Took 2 Shots of vodka, drank out of Al's Malibu and popped a Xan. Went to Joeys all fucked up and drank more beer from the keg. Ended up taking a couple keg stands. Then dont remember shit walked out of the garage threw up in the street, on my shoe, and on my purse that pretty much sucked.  Sat in the curb for a few minutes than wanted to walk. Dont remember the walk but ended up at US 1 and Wilmette seeing cop cars and a flipped truck. It was Ph il's truck that was flipped and all the cops knew I was wasted. So a cop named Jay who comes into Hull's knew I wasted and gave me a ride home. So I ended up at home safe. Then Sunday was a definite 360. What a crazy time i am just glad its kind of over."

"event","i find my self confused about many things. i dont know whats going on with things lately but things have been affecting me alot more. Little things are getting to me I mean i dont know if&nbsp; its just me or if they should be getting&nbsp; to me or not. I find myself going between 2 things i mean one part of the day I feel really upset about everything and the other part of the day im just in the middle about everything. It feels like my friends are drifting apart from me or it may just be me thinking that. i need something just to make me happy all the time maybe find some xannies this weekend or some other kind of fucking pill. I dont know what to do about the whole Kaytee situation. It seems everytime she makes up with me she goes and turns around and does something else that just pisses me off. First its not being around and not really being there anymore. Then its She blows us off after making plans with us. Then she picks out my flaws on multiple occasions to find out im getting pissed and then says shes kidding, but I dont like someone who is going to sit there and humiliate me all the time in front of all my friends with certain things that are tempermental to me i just dont know i guess it could be with draw from drugs but i dont think so i dont think it could make me feel the way i do feel but then again drugs do crazy things."

"event","well......lif hasnt changed much. Dont know if the plans of going to costa rica in december are still intact. but i guess ill find out when my dad emails me the flight or just ends up sending me a plane ticket. i guess when that time comes it will just fall into place. Well saving up for a car before my birthday will be a difficult task especially since we are trying to cut back everybodies hours. i also planned on asking for a raise so i guess thats out of the question also since jimmy is trying to save money. Havent been going to school much in the past 3 days. didnt go friday or monday and only attended 3rd block today yes the bitch ms. ganikon is going to have a few words to say about that but fuck her its my grades and my life she needs to keep her mouth and nose out of it. Homecoming is right around the corner which is freaking awesome were going to have a hell of a time i cant wait. dinner is going to be awesome. dancing with kaytee is going to be awesome just like the night at Razzles so much fun especially the state of mind we were in we had the time of our life it was awesome. its the day after my birthday which requires me to get totally fucked up out of my mind all weekend. no boyfriend is kind of fun but then i get that lonely feeling and having no one to cuddle with.  i hate not having the same feelings fun exciting sad happy relationships that Mauri and Kaytee have with their boyfriends.i guess ill get over it and eventually end up finding someone im happy with.well im done updating  good bye"

I found myself the other morning waking up at 6 and freaking out where&nbsp; I was and what the hell happened the night before but all i remember is taking the 2 1/2 and getting to Bretts. Yes there still is no boy and really I could care less yes I do have my down times where I get depressed about not having one and kaytee and Mauri do but hey I'm free and I love it. I can do whatever I want. I also found my self coming home today to My brother and some fucking random girl sleeping in my bed.&nbsp;<br />Yes.<br />My Bed.<br />WTF?</p>
<p>Well I came to find that friends keep the&nbsp;slightest most important thoughts about you from you. Its human nature to hurt one another or bring another one&nbsp;down to make you feel better about yourself even if they are your friends. well got shit to clean so ill update the rest later.</p>"

"event","Well I had a rather interesting Easter. I woke up to having to get ready real quick becuase I was going to church with Mauri and her family. I had to sit through that nonsense that I wasnt even listening to which is quite bad to say. We then went back to the Aunt's house to eat and just visit. Played a competitive game of Spoons which was quite entertaining. Mauri brought me home around 3. I found out my crazy grandmother was coming over for dinner so quite pissed about that because the woman is absolutely crazy. Well ended up asking my mom if i could drink some champagne becuase i was going to be able to deal with that woman all night sober and the only illegal my mom will let me do in front of her on holidays is drink. So of course i suck down my first to glasses until I get 9 r 10 really didnt keep track. i call up Mauri she comes picks me up with Kaytee and Ashley falling. i was drunk off my ass. We took a trip to the park where Shea Miller was i said hi to him and I guess reintroduced my self even tho he already knew who I was since we did go out. Headed to Kaytee's sat out front smoked some. Then ended up ordering pizza the pizza guy showed up and i had fallen asleep on this mat thing out side&nbsp;the house.&nbsp;that I didnt even eat everyone else did i was so pissed becuase while they are eating pizza my head is in a toilet puking not fun at all.&nbsp; Then ended up passing out on Kaytee's bed after she helped take care of me. Oh one other thing Kaytee and Mauri pinned me down again and did some marker fun EASTER = DRUNK!! Well ill update the rest later leaving the library when im supposed to be at school I am a failure and suck at life."

"event","Well lets start from the beginning it all started yesterday when I decided to attend school. Wrong choice on my part. First i leave my phone at home and of course i feel lost without it. Well i decide to arrive in 2nd block and you know how you get those slips to go seem mr. Carter well ms. Cerveny had like 5 of them and of course what happens when i dont want to get one? I get one of course. Well so i go down there talk to mr. carter about how i didnt go to my friday school before Spring Break and he had already rescheduled that from the saturday before. Well he told me he couldnt reschedule it again so he would have to give me 2 days of ISS. Well then i hear over the walkie talkies ms. Jones is asking to see me. Well i go back to ms. Cervenys class and ms. Bell is standing there waiting for me she asks me to gather my stuff and go see ms. Jones. So I go down to attendance. i go talk to ms. Jones and of course I hear the same old bullshit i heard before. of how stupid I must be and when am i gonna grow up and she took my off campus sticker. Well then she put me in ISS or the rest of yesterday and I had to go all today and ill be in there again  tomorrow. 

Let me say life is pretty much boring for me right now. oh  and i decided FUCK BOYS!!!!! i am so sick of them all I ever do is fucking be nice and  of course I get a fucking asshole back. Well Derrek and  I arent talking anymore at all. My life is now school work and more school and work. i am also probably failing Spanish and English but hey what can you do I havent been to Spanish in god knows how long. i hate Seabreeze so much i wish I could just drop out and go to DBCC. i really do wish i could just straighten up and actually get my act together and go to school and actually do my work but its way too hard I just cant do it. Well I guess tomorrow is another day of ISS which should be fun  cant wait!!! Well the good thing about tomorrow is Mauri and I are both off. Well i guess peace out homie!"

I thought it would just be a life of partying and being wasted every night until I was very wrong. i probably fucked up something that could of been amazing. It is such a shame becuase after all he has done I still want&nbsp; him back. i waited so long for what I did have this spring break and then I totally fucked it up. Even though the shit that he did staying at my house, going out with me, but then he left comments on girls myspaces about how they were sexy and shit. thats FUCKED UP!!!!<br /><br />Weill I guess I learned the hard way even tho I didnt even want to learn anything. I just wanted to be happy and actually have something good going for me. Well Spring break ends today and it totally sucks becuase we have to go back to school tomorrow and im stressing out about my report card&nbsp; and just having to deal with my spanish teacher who is a major dyke. I kid you not. Well Mauri good luck with ms. Jones tomorrow. im tired as shit peace.<br /></p>"

Seriously i miss him soo much but then at the same time i dont want a boyfriend to deal with right now. i feel so stupid for saying that becuase i finally get what i want and then I dont want it anymore. its quite stupid.. i havent updated in a while i dont know I either dont have the time to or dont feel the need to. i feel empty without him and i feel the need&nbsp; to have him around but when he is around i feel smothered with his presence. i guess i just dont kno what to think anymore. Well we go back to school Monday which i am definitly not looking forward to. i seriously hate that place. My grades suck i never want to go or do any work. i have no motivation and it just feels like i have failed myself and my mom. I guess im just going to have to face the consequences whatever those might be. I dont know how to act or sometimes i dont know what path to choose or what choices to make I just feel like each step i take im fucking up my life even more. late.<br /></strong>"

That all your here for &nbsp;is to learn a lesson. i feel that way sometimes that god puts these difficult paths through your life to make you stronger&nbsp; so when you end up in heaven you are a stronger person than you once were. i feel like everything I count on to work out or happen always crumbles to pieces or just doesnt ever go the way i want it to. i have learned that even your closest friends can betray you, but you still forgive them becuase you feel a emptiness without them. I have also learned that people you care about the most always lie even if you dont want them to. Sometimes I feel so stupid for succeeding with&nbsp;some of my actions that it was all a waste of time or should of never happen. Its funny&nbsp;how someone can tell you that they care for you so much&nbsp;and&nbsp;only wants you and nobody else and then turns around and acts like thats not even how&nbsp; they felt.

Well i have so many projects in my classes now to do. Like in my computer class i have to make a computer science project and history I have to write a stupid story made up by me but have historic events in it. I am kind of stressing out. Well I dont kno lately I have  ben just feeling kind of blah and i dont really kno how I feel like half the time im depressed/upset, then the other times i can occasionally be happy i dont kno I guess im just stressing about some stuff lately. Tomorrow is early release thank god. i am just so tired lately I didnt get enough sleep this weekend so now I find my self sleeping in 1st and 2nd but whatev. i hate how people can judge someone or hate someone so much when they dont even kno that person at all. its either guys or just stupid conflicts that hold people back from just being friends or just not hating eachother and letting life go on. People can be so stupid sometimes its ridiculous. the Volleyball banquet is next week I think on a monday, but I forgot the date for it and I have to bring dessert and I still have to take my traffic school ugh! so much shit to pay for and my gym membership.

Well I might be going out of town for thanksgiving if my mom lets me that is and if I can get work off. I think this weekend i will ask for my raise. I have piced back up my schedule and am working again so i should be entilted to one and plus I have been working there a year and only have gotten one so I think its time. Well have to go winter shopping for the trip if I go. Derrek no longer gets out November 1st its more like December 14th now which is kind of depressing becuase he would be coming home next tuesday but now I have to wait 47 more days. i hate his stupid probation officer who wont let him come home early. i was reading some old journal entries yesterday from when Derrek and I first started talking and then went out and I was just thinking to my self wow how dumb was I? It's suprising how much you can change over a little period of time you dont realize it but you do.&nbsp;Well things have been kind of weird lately. i hate how people can get mad at another person for stating there opinion and then they get mad about it when&nbsp; they dont like it. Its stupid I mean people pick out flaws in people all the time but have they ever realized there own. Its just kind of ridiculous. I am just rambling sorry. It just has been bothering me since 2 of my really good friends are going to lose a friendship over something really stupid. I just hate to sit back and watch. the other person doesnt realize that the person who did say it was just looking out for the feelings of another friend. It is time to grow up now and talk it out. Don't just ignore the fact that you arent talking. People are just really stupid sometimes. well havent gooten the car yet which this is getting to become very ridiculous I have been waiting forever and my mom is killing me with this shit. Well i guess ill update later when I actually want to again."

This shit fucking sucks now&nbsp; I just wish yesterday I made better choices yesterday. i feel so bad for damaging more of Mauris car&nbsp; but ill save up and pay it all back. Well I think im going to school tomorrow and if anyone says anything to me I aint gonna care becuase I dont give a shit what people fucking think about me they can shove it. Well they just pushed my tooth back this morning it hurt soo bad but I took the pain killers they gave me&nbsp; which was good. I love pain killers there the best. I am soo just disappointed with myself I spent 4 hours in the hopsital yesterday which sucked just getting checked out and waiting for them&nbsp; to take a cat scan. I found out last night that nothing is broken thank god. I have a very swollen lip and one of my teeth were pushed back and made my mouth bleed my braces saved my tooth from falling out which I also thank god for. I just got that fixed this morning and the swelling is supposed to go down eventually.&nbsp;I hate missing school and and now missing volleyball ugh! Well ill update later when i feel like it."

Mauri and I are going to die without him especially since the whole jonny thing. Well yes officially saturday night Jonny and I will not be talking anymore due to alot of stuff. To add on to the night i missed Derrek's call once again and to come to find out when i walk into mauris room guess who is sitting in her little sisters comp chair hmmmmm?????????KEPA maybe? umm yea! that was freaking omg i  dont even kno  what that just topped off the night and made it just grande. well sunday was fun hung out with Mauri and Jill and went to the beach then saw shawn later and had fun. Well he hasnt called tonight and hes prolly mad so i dont expect him to. But i want him to and the only night im actually home around 7 30 hes not gonna freaking call.

"event","OMG tomorrow is friday and im not even scared yet of the test for my license omg I cant wait. Well I finally came to realize i shouldnt let stuff bother me soo much I mean hello there is more to life than stupid arguments with friends, fights with ex/boyifriends, and just thinking life sucks becuase it doesnt. When you think life is getting really bad and it sucks always think that God only gives you as much as you can handle nothing more. You just need to let things go and look on the brighter side of stuff. I was just sitting on the curb at work waiting for my mom to come pick me up and i was looking at the beautiful sky and was thinking i cant let things bother me theres more to life out there in the world than to get upset over stupid stuff now. Becuase your not gauranteed to find ur soul mate when ur 16 your just looking for someone to have fun with. Dont let little things get to you. haha it was funny because Derrek was talking about how god is against him and stuff and i told him it could get worse becuase god only gives you as much as you can handle and he says ok Miss Preacher omg it was hilarious lol. I hate how my friends think I cant do something when I kno I can and they sit there and say your not gonna be able to do  that or they think im crazy im doing it. I mean hello if I want to do it then let me just get off my ass about it im not trying to pin it on one person this is kind of a general friends thing. I mean yea sometimes when they say oh ur not gonna be able to do  that and start to laugh it still bothers me i mean it happens alot especially with the whole me and Derrek still together while hes in there they think is stupid and shouldnt wait or think i cant wait which is ridiculous becuase if I can wait or want to then let me dont make snotty remarks on how I should live my life. I make my own mistakes and i learn from them so if nothing comes out of this then oh well thats my own fault but dont come back saying I told you so when I say it becuase thats the shit that really bothers me. Well i guess ill quit my bitching finally and go take my lovely shower I hope."

Well maybe ill actually try and bring up my grades when I get back start focusing on the school and not soo much whats going on with guys and partying. Well my spring break has been eventful and pretty shit at the same time. Lets just say my baby is in jail and isnt coming out for a while omg I miss him soo much and cant wait for him to get out and some people dont think i can do it but  I can im going to wait for him becuase he means everything to me. Anyways he will be gone for a while which is very depressing becuase i want him now. Well enough about that the last 2 nights I have hung out with Chris hes a really nice and cool guy we had alot of fun right lol Crop Gravy haha that was great! Well i guess I am just not feeling really up to going to school Monday im kind of dreading. Well I worked today from 9-9 which was alright i guess I was just soo tired this morning I didnt even feel like getting out of bed plus i was late for work. I just feel so lonely I want my baby back. I want my Derrek. UGH! Anyways Juan called me tonight that was weird  didnt expect that out of  the blue. Well spent all break with Mauri practically but its been fun. Well I guess Mauri and Andres arent talking anymore as Mauri says but that wont last too long haha i kno they will talk eventually. Well i have been missing all of derreks calls and maybe god just doesnt want us together. I fucking miss him soo much i just want him to come and lay in my bed with me and just rub on my stomach like he use to do and carry me to bed again. 4-5 month is a long ass time but im waiting for him. Well hopefully he will call tomorrow and ill be home and we will talk cuz I miss his voice, I miss his smile with his squinty eyes and long shaggy hair with his hair flick. Well i guess ill update later when I have more to say and actually feel like typing it."

"event","<P>Well this weekend was interesting a 3 day weekend which was great. It was also Mauris Birthday which was also awesome becuase i loved the present that i got her even the jewelry place i got it from didnt engrave stuff anymore on it which made me mad becuase i was gonna get our initials engraved on it. So I got her a charm bracelet with a volleyball on it. Well we stayed in Orlando this weekend at the Hyatt Grand Cypress Resort which was alot of fun but also stressful for Mauri becuase her mom and sister came which made it worse in her situation. Well we had fun we layed out, hit up the hot tub,played volleyball, the paddle boat was crazy lol, and just chilled in the awesome hammocks lol or however u spell it. We kind of got burnt. Took ton of pics. Came home yesterday went to the mall bought a cute new shirt. I went home and called Derrek and talked to him on the phone. Hes soo nice I dont kno just something about his personality&nbsp;I like alot. Just hoping one of these days he'll have the balls to come and see me which will probably when&nbsp;i get my license.&nbsp;Speaking of that I get it in 27 days actually i have&nbsp; been saying 29 all day today and its actually 27 omg I CANT WAIT!! Well I have to start looking for a car to buy so any suggestions just leave a comment! looking for either a SUV or a little hott car. I know what a total difference right?!? Well Derrek lost his part of the bet so now he owes me 15$. Wow umm&nbsp;Kris just called me very random hes wanting to hang out..........ummm&nbsp;dunno about that one. Well I guess hes coming over oh god!!&nbsp;This is where everything just goes down the shitter ugh!&nbsp;Thinking of changing my background and stuff on my live journal have any suggestions just comment! Ill update later I have to go freshen&nbsp; up&nbsp;for this stupid&nbsp; kid!</P>

They're an outfit called Music Choice, but their website doesn't have anything useful on it that I can access. My cable company isn't even listed on their silly login thing. What purpose locking their playlist info away like that serves, I have no clue.

So far, it seems like last year's playlist with a couple less than spooky songs plopped in. Don't know if I should go to the hassle of hooking up the mostly useless cable tv box so I can record it again."

Having missed out last year due to medical issues, this was the first time with the new location. Lots of walking if you're staying in the Hilton. I liked my room. It was kind of retro. When I saw the elevator lines at the Marriott, I didn't always mind the walk. ;)

That long walk between hotels and the main conspace was like passing through some twilight zone airport terminal, especially at night. Trudging back to my room in costume through that mausoleum made me want to pop my head and ""ruin the magic"", which I saw more and more suiters doing this con.

Wasn't feeling that great half the time. Woke up really achy every single morning. (Getting a flu shot less than a week before the con may not have been the best timing, but so far, no crud either!) Something got in my eye when I left home Thursday, (it was very windy) and my left eye hurt a lot all day Friday and the eyelid got swollen. That scared me for a while, but the old soaking with a hot washcloth trick helped it to mostly clear up by Sunday.

Didn't get as much suit time as I wanted. In spite of some improvements to the vision in my mask, I'm still having comfort problems with the suit overall. That and a near fall on some stairs is making me think it's time to hang it up. (Although it's harder to do so without another costume in the pipeline.) 

As I had done a couple years back, I wound up escorting a certain huge baby dragon on his rampages without mishap. As per usual, not enough time with people I haven't seen in a while. It was almost comically sad how I kept missing one person I was trying to find half the time. We were both on the dance floor in costume at the same time, and I didn't see them. 

Lots of neat suits this year. Some brought out the fanboy in me. Furry Frolic was an interesting surreal experience. Saw the ""Men in Suits"" doc screening both times, and I wasn't the only one who cheered when the Gorn clip came up.

Hopefully, I'll be in better health next year, because the new layout does take it's toll if you're slightly under the weather. Maybe if they built a small monorail inside the convention center?"

isn't that the cutest pic ever??

Todd is a such a great sport when it comes to taking my bunny pics for me.  I'll try again tomorrow and hopefully I can get a shot so that you can't see the carrot and <i>really</i> looks like bunny kisses!"

"event","CA is having a weird heat wave these past few days and i can see how its affecting the bunnies.  BonBon is shedding like CRAZY and under the bed is covered in fur. (I just cleaned it like 2 weeks ago too!)  He is also very moody!  Snickie and him keep chasing each other and nipping bums.  This afternoon is about 98 degrees and i brought out the ice packs.  I put one in Opie's water bowl and she played ""bob the ice pack"" for 30 minutes!  It was so cute to watch. I put the other ice pack under the bed with BonBon and Snickie but they just kept pushing/attacking it until it was not under the bed anymore.  Silly bunnies!  i wish i had a camera so i can take pics. 

The fan is on full blast in both rooms and i put ice cubes in BonBon and Snickie's water bowl to keep the water cold.  (The ice pack is too big for their little cooler.)  They seem to enjoy that... Poor babies... you can tell they aren't very comfortable... DAMN THIS WEATHER!!

If i had my own house i would have to buy one of those wading pools b/c i think they'd enjoy that!"

"event","i am not sure but somehow dr. melody frankenbunny was able to contact my bunnies b/c when i got home there was total CHAOS!! bonbon and snickie somehow got behind the NIC barrier and chewed up my computer wires!! OMG! todd was so pisssed... so we spent a couple hours this afternoon trying to figure out what needed to be replaced. here's the damage list:

speaker wires
lamp wire
monitor wire
telephone wire
2 USB cables
1 ethernet cable

cripes! the wires were ok to replace but the wire that b & s chewed thru on the monitor wasn't the power cord b/c i can easily get a replacement for that, but they chewed thru the wire that attaches the monitor to the CPU and that doesn't detach so you have to buy a whole new monitor. they also chewed a little of the cable wire so my connection is kinda sporadic/slow... i have a feeling i'll be calling time warner cable to come out and replace that wire... ugh... can you say expensive?? bonbon and snickie also succeeded in chewing up 2 of my stuffed animals b/c there was cotton strewn all over the floor. also the bed comforter has chew holes in it too.

AND THERE'S MORE!

opie destroyed the kitchen linoleum somehow  she was able to pull up patches of the linoleum so i have to pay for my apt to fix it.

sigh... maybe its their way of saying ""welcome home mommy!"""

"event","Now that my vacation plans are more set in stone (officially bought the tickets this past weekend) i am geting antsy about leaving the buns for so long... The last time we left the buns, Todd's brother took care of them and he called me 4 days later to say that opie was sick and going diarrhea really bad... so we cut our trip short and came home a day earlier... but obviously LV is much closer than vietnam so... 

i realized after that trip that opie suffers from separation anxiety.  I always knew we had a close bond, but i never realized that she would make herself sick over me being gone... i will probably leave todd's brother instructions to give her rescue remedy everyday so hopefully that will keep her calm.

So... forget being ""home sick"", I know that while i am in vietnam i'll be bunny sick... i miss my bunnies just thinking that we'll be separated that long...  Do you think the bunnies will forget all about me while i am gone?  i hope when i come home they won't think of me as a stranger... =/"

experienced bunny lover to take care of the infamous BUNNSKETEERS!
send qualifications to <a href=""mailto:my03bunnies@yahoo.com"">my03bunnies@yahoo.com</a>
Must be 21 and over to apply

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v123/cinnabun/LL_sig.jpg"" alt=""Bunnsketeers""></center>
It looks like i will be needing a new bunnysitter when i go to vietnam for 3 weeks (approximate dates: July 20 - Aug 7).  It was originally gonna be Michelle (my coworker) but she is moving and mentioned that she didnt wanna stay at my apt (she is currently my neighbor so it would have been easier) but now that her new apt is farther away she doesn't seem that interested anymore...  since i definitely want someone who WANTS to take care of my buns i was thinking...  

If i bought someone a plane ticket to CA, you could stay at my apt, see the sites around my home (disneyland, knotts berry farm, shopping malls, etc etc) do you think anyone would be interested???  (obviously you have to have some rabbit care experience and/or be someone i trust, the ticket can't be <i>that</i> expensive, and i would only provide one ticket so if you wanna make a vacation out of it your traveling partner would need to pay their own way...) there would also be some light housework (ie collect mail, take out trash, vacuum, etc etc) 

<u>Duties include:</u>
- feeding 2 meals/day to 3 bunnies
- cleaning litterboxes every 4-5 days
- playing with bunnies 
- taking TONS of pics for me!

food for thought for my LJ bunny friends, k?"

Now that my wireless is working better (or maybe the operator - me - understands how to work it better) its been really easy to use my lappie in another room.  

Since i usually sit on a beanbag at the coffee table, its opie new thing to bump my knee or foot so that she can get some pets while i am on my lappie.  For the last few nights i have even been holding her in my lap while i am typing (one handed).  Its been great!!  she must feel comfortable/supported by my legs b/c she falls ASLEEP!!  i am just loving it!  she kinda hums really softly when she's drifting off to sleep and i am petting her cheeks, tummy and feet the whole time... what could be more perfect?  computer and OPIE!  heheee...

The inside of the house will have a comfy doggy bed floor and still thinking about painting it and putting her name on the front too!  also wanna get this cute doggy bed that i saw at a store near me (love the name:  MOONDOGGIES) where you can insert a cold/hot pad thing inside depending on the weather... of course since bunnies already have a fur coat i'll probably use the ""cold"" one all the time in the ""house"" part."

"event","I brought Snickie and BonBon in together so that snickie could be moral support!  I also think that an unfamiliar place with loud noises would strengthen their bond seeing as they snuggled together for comfort.  It was interesting to me that everyone that met them seemed to LOVE snickie more than bonbon.  Usually its the other way around... Its hard to resist those lop ears!  hehee...

As i thought, Dr. wayne did a skin scrape, cytology and culture.  All the tests (except the culture b/c it takes a while for anything to grow on the agar tray) were negative for ringworm, mites or any other parasites.  We also ruled out rabbit syphilisis (whew!) b/c his genital area was clean and clear!  So Dr. wayne is a little stumped right now.  He asked me if BonBon chews on anything in particular that might be rubbing up against his mouth, licking his lips alot, housed in a dry area, etc etc... BonBon isn't a big chewer so I didn't think it was that and even though i haven't observed him licking his lips i am not sure about that one.  Dr. wayne was thinking it might be equivalent to ""hot spots"" that dogs get.  But he's gonna call another collegue of his tonight and get a second opinion before he gives me any medication.  I thought that was kinda cool that he admitted he was kinda stumped, but he seemed willing to still try to figure it out you know?

I think the thing that really worked for me was establishing different territories between BonBon and Snickie and bringing Snickie into BonBon's territory in the end.  Females seem to be more territorial (at least mine are) and even though when I brought Snickie into BonBon's territory there were some growls and a couple nips they eventually worked things out.  I also think the car rides and laundry trips were really good bonding tools, but i honestly think that spending time outside with them in a totally neutral territory was the clencher!

Since its the first day I wouldn't say they were ""absolutely bonded"" but definitely very close.  I went shopping for an hour and left them alone and came back and they were still doing well... baby steps... baby steps..."

"event","Nothing to worry about, but he has skin issues around his mouth... Dr. Heidi saw him a couple months ago for the same issue and determined it was an allergic reaction to his plastic feel bowls.  I switched to ceramic and now to metal and it cleared up... but around his mouth its starting to get all scabby and flaky again even though his bowl is still metal.  I have looked up about rabbit skin issues on the internet and most of them are parasite related (ringworm and/or mites (mange, fur, ear canker)) but i know that its not parasites causing it b/c Dr. Heidi did a skin scape last time and it was negative for any parasites so thats why she diagnosed it as an allergy.

But since its back I decided to bring him back to the vet since his meds ran out a while ago (i believe we were getting baytril suspension as the antibiotic).  Since Dr. Heidi doesn't work on Thursdays, Dr. Wayne will be checking him out instead.  I wonder if there will be a different prognosis.  could it be weather related?  

Luckily he's eating well, BMs are normal, playful, drinking well etc etc so i am not too worried.  I just wish i knew what was causing these flare ups of skin irritation.  He has such an adorable mouth that i want to keep it that way...

bonding technique --> smooshing together on the couch

I usually start all my bondings with this method.  I put all the bunnies in one space between my legs and a pillow or another person (bf's are good for something!) and keep them there for a good 10-15 minutes... during this time i am rubbing their heads and talking to them in a low voice... As i feel them loosen up i am also loosening up my grip and getting them to try to relax together... Usually the next step is a car ride...

Right now i have been slowly trying to rebond my bunnies... I miss my bunnsketeers and i miss more that there use to be only 1 litterbox and now there are 3 separate ones *wink wink*.  Unfortunately with my job and other responsibilities its harder for me to bond the way i am use to so i am trying new things that my bunnies and i are not use to... which is probably making the whole process a bit harder and more frustrating for us all.  Its interesting to me that upon this bonding time, the girls are EVIL to each other when they use to be best friends... maybe it has something to do with their new found territorial nature with bonbon vs cinnabun.  Both girls are good with bonbon by themselves but when i put all 3 together either snickie or opie will go right for the face!  sigh... i have a feeling its gonna be a long road..."

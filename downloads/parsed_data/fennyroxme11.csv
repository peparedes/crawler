"event","Well this weekend was completely and utterly innappropriate for soooo many reasons....first of all we did the umass chant at the club hahaha with the RIC girl standing right there, and i saw a girl in my spanish class at the club(weird) and my teacher held up the test just for me...haha thats awesome...got my girlies in for half the price and Maureen tried to scare them away at the door...we had a bonding session and both came to the same conclusion that straight girls feel comfort in our essence...Holla!  soo us pirates danced the night away, SOOOO OUT OF CONTROL, ashley must have been freaking out the whole time, i hope she had fun, she probably had a heart attack when i was throwing leal around hahahahahahaha, sex on the dance floor....hahahahahaha  moving on before i get tooo aroused...so the club is out and somehow dubby ended up driving sals car, sal ended up going with salas, and me shawna, lissa, and nono, went home in dubs' car...so next thing i know we are at reed rd, and melissa is like im hungry(what else is new), and we had already passed anything to eat at 245 AM, so i say CUMBERLAND Farms is the only thing...so we go there, i think i ruined the old ladies life forever, and if not she is watching reruns of the video huh shan.  And when i went to the bathroom, i had my tshirt hanging out of my pants, and it went in the toilet...HAHAHAHA, and then we dropped everyone off, and i went back to sals....talked on the phone with my friend ;) until like 515 how did i keep my eyes open GEES...and that was my night...hilariously fun, out of control, holy pants, pulled quads, o and by the way i heard from like 8 of my friends how hot amanda leal is...and how they couldnt take their eyes off you...blah blah blah....so holla!!!!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY LAUREN!!!! 
I LOVE YOU BUDDY!!!!!"

7.  I hit a homerun on tues and i was so happy that leal was waiting with open arms(i cant believe she made out with me right on the field!!!!) totally innappropriate
8.  I KNOW EVERYTHING!!! 
9.  My coach owes me big because she promised to drop me off at the concert if i hit a homerun and she lied to me. (obvioulsy she had no faith in me)
10. How do you focus on a game, when we have to focus on being alive, and 20 girl scouts hanging out with us?"

SOOOO softball started, i can not feel my legs, wait let me rephrase, i can feel my legs all tooooo much.  I am sooo sore.
this weekend was a bust, i was supposed to go to the club for my bestest buddy donnas birthday, but that did not work out too well....i will make it up to her though...i was kinda disappointed that i could not spend time with her, she does live two hours away and i never get to see her. =(  but what can i do about it now, nothing I LOVE YOU DONNA.  

so i have decided that my body hurts toooo much to even sit here so i am going to bed"

Ok so I AM A LIAR....for the record there was a time that i just walked away, walked away from my reality of problems, because i hurt someone that i loved very much and did not know how to handle that.  I AM PUBLICALLY MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT...Lauren Ashley Motyl i am sorry that i left things up in the air, that i left you hanging with no answers, to wonder alone.  SO here is the new answer ""Ever left things the way they were just because it would be harder to resolve it?"" Yes i have, but i am older now and that would not happen ever ever again."

New years eve: Went to a house party, was on my way up to the club and decided to stay to go see lauren...it was a good time.

New Years day: Went to the club, it was great i was hammered, extremely intoxicated had a wonderful time, with jackie, sak attack, and rachel

Next day: Worked a pats game, love the ladies, i think i was still drunk in the morning on the ride up with leal, good thing she was my designated driver but i was so tired, and then me and becca and rachel watched a movie.....I LOVE THOSE GIRLS to the extreme

and then tonight i just stayed in and rach and jack came over we watched Dawn of the dead, it was terrible, and now i am very tired and going to go to sleep.

P.S.  Sal has a pretty smile"

Do you understand what i am saying here, or am i not clear in my explanation, either way i hope you feel it, go with it, and run, bc this does not happen too often, no often enough that i can just turn away from you.......

It doesn't matter how long we may have been stuck in a sense of our limitations. If we go into a darkened room and turn on the light, it doesn't matter if the room has been dark for a day, a week, or ten thousand years - we turn on the light and it is illuminated. Once we control our capacity for love and happiness, the light has been turned on.

I LOVE LIFE!

Do you want to hold my hand, like I want to hold yours.  The soft, warm embrace of your touch has left me breathless.  When I hold you in my arms it is like I am in another world.  Silence overtakes the room, and all you can hear is breathing, and the beats of our hearts.  I urn for you to be next to me, to feel our hearts beat together, making soft sweet music.  

big smiles everyone....goodnight"

First of all, how do you tell someone something so many times and they just dont believe you, that just makes me think that you do not believe one word taht come out of my mouth, if i say i like you i like you, if i kiss you more than once it is not bc i am drunk, i wait for your phone calls, i think about you constantly, what else can i do, what can i do? i guess my priorities are off, OK everyone that reads my JOURALS KNOWS that i am not in love with kelly anymore, and if anyone thinks otherwise please let me know, bc i hear it everyday, and gosh dang it, I AM NOT!!!  I LIKE YOU......I LIKE YOU ALOT.........BUT ITS FINE.....think what you wish,  i just wish i knew what you really wanted...........GRRRRRRR sorry about the venting session people, and the world may never know who i am talking about.  if she would express her true feelings to me i would not tell a single soul.......EVER...EVER!  GOODNESS i got to go to bed.....
one last thing.....he will see me as a person not just a lesbian ""i believe"" love is the answer, grrrr YOU ARE MY ANGEL, that has come to rescue me, to save me from this pain...

The moons reflection shining upon the water that is slowly moving towards the shore.  Glistening, glowing, so peaceful, so at ease.  Nature at its best.  The waves quietly connecting with the shore, gently pulling back the rocks that were once there.  The smashing crackle, with the wind caressing the ripples on the surface.  Moving as one, but together at the same time.  The wind is growing stronger, starting to forcefully  move the water.  The wind is not visible like the moons reflection, or the stars that are guiding our way, but it is strong.  AS strong as the emotions that breeze through me as my eyes meet yours.  Your reflection is beautiful, you are as strong as the wind, but as calm as the current, and YOUR star is guiding my way.
......what do you think...? hmm not sure, sooooo went to a stupid don west meeting, was pointless i could get taht paper anytime...but its fine always nice to see everyone, ummmmmmm i saw leals underwear that was a highlight of my night, i changed my voicemail, and since 6:00 this is what i ate...Big Mac, fish sandwich, hot dog, chicken quesadilla hot pocket, and a chicked caeser salad wrap...OMG i am a fat kid yikes, good thing we are going to be on a hard core work out schedule, and some yoga on the side(IT""S SO GOOD!!!) zompetti kills me!  im out of here youngins

I LOVE MY WIFEY...so yeah i got her this awesome perfume...it is by DKNY..smells soooo good on her, and the bottle looks like a green apple...i was the designated driver which is ok bc i am an ALCKY..that is what some people think....MOVING ON...i just need to say that i have been hanging out with straight people for the past few days, they live crazy lives. i am so glad that i am not straight, all i hear is OMG he can only last 30 seconds he cant keep it up, or he has a small dinky, or hows my hair look..all i have to say is i have never heard jayne, shan, mander, sak, sal, any of them ask me how their hair looks, i dunno i guess i just dont fit in...and the stuff they put on their lips is sooo shiny, and shimmery, i am good with CHAPSTICK..i dunno its funny
               ~~~~It is funny how beauty is characterized throughout society.  Beautiful body, eyes, dressed to impress, and  many other physical attributes.  But the way i measure beauty is internal.  The way not your eyes look, but how i feel when i fall in them, am i safe? The way a gentle touch gives a loss of breath.   The way intelligence is always beneath the surface , penetrating in just the perfect moment of connection.  And most importantly the interlock between souls, the chemisty flowing radidly, causing the stomach to hurt, and misbeats on the heart.~~~~ 
        my new thing is i am going to write a book, a book on life, and how the choices you make effect more people than you know, and what happens to you is what you deserve, so everyone needs to buy a copy....  I ATE A SANDWICH from garys and it was lovely, although i was really fucked up it was wonderful, must be bc lealy made it, and she gave me a great deal...but i gave her the tip bc she is pretty ;)....she wants to make out with me but i told her that it is just wrong for two girls to make out ewwwwwww ahaha ok jk.....I LOVE MY WIFEY,..........HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY LOVE!!!!

ok first things first there is nothing really extraordinary about my life right now, there is not to much to say.  I can say that i miss my volleyball team already, and i miss my l-unit i feel like i have not seen them in forever...but that is fine...i decided that i will never date a lesbian, out of 200 people at the club last night the one girl that i choose is straight, what the fuck are the odds.   still bought her a drink and she was really nice, but that is it...

In other news...i coached some little boys today and it was really fun..
     i love my wifey..
i love sal bc she has no shame with me
       i love jayney even though i have not heard from her in forever and the only way know she is alive is bc i can check her idle time....hahaha
  i love this girl that has a cute laugh and scrunches up her nose
oh yeah and the year 1987
      shanono you are my boy, i cant wait to say that out loud!
  my finger is bigger than the penis of a boy that will remain anonymous! ha
 i am becoming extememly overwhelmed with everything around me, but a certain someone tells me to just ride the wave so that is exactly what i am going to do...

Saw 3 movies this week 
TAXI-----A+  i recommend it 100%
Alfie.....if you want to take a nap go there it will put you to sleep, i had more fun texting people

* Sad but true kelly still turns me on, and vice versa! we only danced together once because it was like we were having sex on the dace floor so that was uncomfortable

"event","Well my update would take forever so i will just give a briefing.  Ok i have been partying it up because this is my last weekend becuase DOUBLE SESSIONS start YUCK!  anyways you know what sucks is when you know there are about 3 girls that are willing to hook up and do whatever but none of them are who you truly want, and the one that you truly want is wrapped up somewhere else and cant even call you =( but i mean i dont want to lead these girls on becasuei am not the hooking up type, and i do not want to lead them on and be thinking of someone else, and no it is not KELLY.  Speaking of saw her yesterday, went to a bar with her and my friend liz, it was legit though, I HATE her , because she is not my friend anymore but thats ok..it was my CHOICE!  But back to the girls that does not mean that i did not go down the cape and you know say whats up, but UGH itssss SOOOO annoying!  ONE WORD: ASEXUAL!  haha But there is this one straight girl that was at TANYA's the other day, ""STRAIGHT"" but bumping and grinding on me, ok no, get over it..this girl is not straight, if she was she would not have been rubbing up on me, very pretty, my type, just no connection....what do i do? god i wish i was a douchebag sometimes and just really pimp it out, and not care about others feelings but whatever.  This is not helping me i am just getting PISSED so i am going to go.  

SEE ME FOR WHO I AM, WHAT I REPRESENT, AND WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER YOU.

But yes it feels great...and no time soon will i have one either, but i do want someone to take to another mental level with, but even if not i am so happy.  You would think i would be going through hard core sex withdrawals but i am doing ok!  So i have been hangin with Tonya alot lately, she is a cool shit, one of the nicest, most honest people ever, and she always has a smile on her face, i am so glad that we became friends.  And also i saw a girl from my high school who is so pretty, and it was so good to see her, and she helped me pick out lealys bday gift, well kinda...Oh i went to six flags, i dont think i put this in here yet..umm yeah i made a comment to these two guys ""RIDE EM COWBOY"" and they said hey we are not the ones who are gay, yeah well make this story short tonya and her girls bitched at them and their girls and she ashed her cigarette on that ignorant loser...haha she wanted to throw it at him but i would not let her do it. AND then the guy gor real pissed because as we were walking away i said dont hate bc my girl is prettier than anything you could get, and put my arm around her and walked away...i wish you guys could have seen his face!  Oh and me and sal are going out we are girlfriends...or at least that is what people think..which i think is so funny bc she is so not my type!  Well my eyes hurt so that is good enough for me, give me some love, and im outie like a belly button =)

And she is even willing to work around us fall athletes, because even though i would love to play fall ball, there is nothing like smacking a volleyball into someones face.  And volleyball has a new coach too, he is going to be great, the vball team needs a huge turnaround, and i think he is going to be the one that can do it!  

Having the house to myself is great, i get a bunch of down time, and am just lazy watching MOVIES.  The mighty ducks is very inspiring.

   I got a job, yes finally, and all i have to do it drive a older lady around because she is scared to drive on the highway. im getting paid under the table to drive a benz, so basically i am a driver which is what i always do GREAT.
   Next thing on the list i am academically eligible to play VOLLEYBALL!!! YAY..im so excited, the coach called me this morning, and left a message and when i called him back and told him that i got 4 f's last semester, he told me to just go check it out, so i went there, and i am eligble, somehow my gpa is still above 2.0.  This is my chance to turn myself around and i am not letting it pass me by i am so grateful for it.  So yes this new coach is awesome, and i started today going to the gym, i am going to make it a everyday habit.  

Things i need to do
   Get courses
   
   Get in shape by aug 25 for triple sessions
   
   Quit Butts, which by the way i am almost there, i only had   4 today..go me!

   Keep just the people in my life that are going to better me as a person and motivate me to do great things

   Say goodbye to my first love, mary jane!

http://www.naucon.net/misc/tests/easiest_quiz.htm


Whats you favorite fruit?
http://www.naucon.net/misc/tests/fruit.htm
Peach

Like a peach, you enjoy the juice of life it all its lush ripeness! You are the friendly sort, and are quite frank and outspoken, which adds to your charm. You are quick to forgive and forget; and value your friendships highly. You have an independent and ambitious streak in you, that makes you a real go-getter. You are the ideal lover, fiery and passionate but sincere and faithful in love. You don't however like to display all that passion in public.
(public display of affection is kinda looked down on in society for me, so i respect other people, you know me!!!)

What cartoon character are you?
http://www.naucon.net/misc/tests/cartoon_char.htm
You are Tweety.

You are cute, and everyone loves you.  You are a best friend that
no one takes the chance of losing.  You never hurt feelings and
seldom have your own feelings hurt.  Life is a breeze.  You are
witty, and calm most of the time.  Just keep clear of back stabbers,
and you are worry-free.

somewhere i have never travelled

somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond 
any experience, your eyes have their silence: 
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me, 
or which i cannot touch because they are too near 

your slightest look easily will unclose me 
though i have closed myself as fingers, 
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens 
(touching skillfully, mysteriously) her first rose 

or if your wish be to close me, i and 
my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly, 
as when the heart of this flower imagines 
the snow carefully everywhere descending; 

nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals 
the power of your intense fragility whose texture 
compels me with the colour of its countries, 
rendering death and forever with each breathing 

(i do not know what it is about you that closes 
and opens; only something in me understands 
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) 
nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands 

e. e. cummings, 1894-1962

"event","Summer darkness was absolute fantastic!!!!.
I've seen great bands like The Frozen autumn,Clan of Xymox and my favourite, Cinema Strange!
They gave a great show. They were a laugh. To see the singer dancing about with the mic stand and th guys being all overeachother while playing. Das Ich gave a great show,a party more like it.
Sleeping in a tent wasn't as bad as i expected it to be. 
So i'll be going to Flevo festival soon (it's a christian festival).
And there i'll be sleeping in a tent to. I wonder how that will be. Till than

"event","I'm so exited about going to Summer Darkness festival. Alot of good bands and nice people. To avoid travelling alot me and my friend Eva Bla decided to camp near the action in Utrecht. It's been 9 years since i camped in a tent. It's ok i'm not to keen on camping but for this festival even camping sounds cool enough hahaha.
For those of you outside of Europe Summer Darkness is a goth festival.

Several days after SD is over i'm going to another festival called Flevo. It's a christian alternative festival sorta like Cornerstone i guess. But even there i'll be staying in a tent. Oh fantastic. But he it's really cheap.

It's the first time i'm going to Flevo and i've no idea what to expect but alot of fun.So i guess i'll be ok. Alot of people i know are going there so that be ok.

That's all for now. Greets"

We had a lot of thoughed on it and prayed alot about the whole love thing.
We have decided to be good friends and not to rush things as we did at first.We want to know one another better and it felt good and yet somewhere it didn't.

We pray alot for eachother and it works fine. It really made our friendship alot stronger.
So who knows in the end it might happen after all for us to be..............in love?

But i don't really want to think that far ahead i enjoy the way things are right now"

The thing is that i have a sarcastic sense of humour as some of you out here already know. And with some of you i can really have a great time of laughter exchanging these jokes and we understand.

In other places such as work some people don't have a clue.So with my parents to.
It is so exhausting to constantly explaning the jokes you make because they don't get it.
If you know what i mean. Some people say i should start acting in a play or become a comedian.

I really made it bad last sunday. I had to eat something and i didn't want to eat in a fancy place. At that moment i was in Arnhem and i felt like the star attraction. People were staring at me like they never saw a goth before. 
So i decided to keep it simple i ate some chips with hot sauce and added sambal just a little bit (for those of you who do not know what sambal is it's a spicy indonesian sauce of mached peppers). I continued with 2 frikandellen and some more sambal and a chicken burger.

For the next 2 days i had the enjoyment of a crumbling burning stomache.Great fun (sarcastic)!
I went to bed really early and took some pills wich a colleague gave me.The combination worked fine. I feel ok now but for now i will have to do it easy on the sambal."

Anyway. The weather was lovely last weekend. Especially on saturday.
I went out with a friend on saturday to look for a long leather jacket.

In stead i came home with a bass chorus paddle.We were in the guitar shop in 
Amsterdam. And i loved the bass guitars i saw there.And there it was the bass chorus paddle!
Only 25 Euro's!!!! So the shopkeeper plugged it in and i was in love with the sound.
I have no idea how long we've been there but i guess at least one and a half hours.

When i came home i plugged it in straight away and fiddled with other sound effect to.
Like chorus in combination with reverb and flanger. Oh man i really dig the sound.
 Corus and flanger are also nice. Maybe you guys  have some tips for me of what other combinations i can use.

I also bought the Pornography album by the Cure again with bonus lp with live stuff from '82.
I LOVE IT!!!!"

The bands that played there did a good job aldough the first one was a bit messy.
The second band Divamee was very cool. the guy at the merch stand told me that they were vegans. That explaned the pics of the bio industry on the vid screen.Whatever they were saying in there lyrics and pics on the screen i agree with them how disrespectfull we handle God's beautifull creations.However the ironic thing was that the message of the band didn't affect the crowd because they were all eating burgers and kroket rolls.hahaha.
The chef that handed out these burgers had a t-shirt on wich sayed ""i beat anorexia"",yep with his round tummy i can't disagree on that. LOL!

The dj's sure kept the vibes strong and i really enjoyed the evening in the venue.Wich was a good thing because the first train home left at 6.30 am and the party ended at 6 am.
I enjoyed the party and i can't wait for the next edition of Unterwelt"

So bad that it was very funny. A bad story about a lesbian girl in a boys uniform who wanted to do a duel with some guy who acted like a prick towards his girlfriend. Whoever would win the duel would win the girl. So she beats this guy and wins the price uh yeah very lame i'd say.we only watched the first episode because it was bad enough. I don't know if i'll ever watch the rest. I saw some anime films in the past. Most of 'em were laughable and weird but very funny. i can't remember the names because it was so long ago.I'm sure i will see some in the future but not for now."

At home i'm fiddling to record some batcave/goth stuff with my bassguitar and drumcomputer. Had 4 trax laid down and sounds pretty cool. I have to find someone to fill in the blancs on guitar.
Sad thing is that I LOST THE TAPE!
Hopefully i'll find it soon enough so i can let someone give it a listen and that the guy can put down his guitar thingies."

I guess it's just one of those life lessons you have to go through from time to time. But they say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I guess that's kinda meant for me at this point because it made me stronger indeed.
Meeting new friends who can help you out in times of need really can give you a push in the right direction. I can also say that i could not have done it without God's help and i'd love to thank those who helped me in prayer.

Sometimes in these moments of darkness i can say stupid things i don't really mean and didn't think about,could hurt other people. I'm really sorry. But i guess we all have moments like that.

I bought a cd from Carnival in Coal and their music gives you joy and lots of laughter. I listened in the train to their cd and i laughed loudly and the people gave me weird looks. These guys rule"

I feel blessed with the good things that come on my path.

I'm still dealing with mixed emotions about a whole lot of things and the coming of the cold and winter isn't really helping. Perhaps it's a goth kinda thing (laughs). Sunshine after the rain they say just as something about a silverlining or something.

 A good thing is that i still have got my sense of humour covering the darkness around me and also with God's help i manage to stay happy to.I'm still going out alot meeting new people wich i love to do.

I wish you all some light at the places where you all are at the moment because i guess we all can use some in these dark days.
Alot of people are dealing with winter depressions at the moment and i hope i won't be one of them.

Than it was time! Siouxsie came on stage and.......WOW!!!
Round 50 years old and still going strong! Bounced on stage like she was25.
They played stuff of her solo album and lots of stuff she did with the Banshees.Like ""Hongkong garden"",""Israel"",and some more i was to exited to remember the rest of the set.
They also did a cover from the Doors wich was funny.
It amazed me that there were people in the venue from all over Europe to see her. I was so happy i was there to see it. I still have a lot of catching up to do with the early 80ies stuff."

I guess the other albums can only get worse from there perhaps that be the reason for their split somewhere in the 90ies.

So in the mean time i can still bounce about the place if i should or shouldn't buy the bass guitar. The shopkeeper adviced me to buy a bass amp first for i still am playing on a regular guitar amp. But it's ok i've done that for years and the amp still does it perfectly even when i use destortion over the bass.

"event","I bought this album a couple of days ago and it's still stuck in my disk man.I really love this band and their sound.But what they do is nothing new. Bands like Fintroll and Eluveitie came before them. But the music makes you wanna have a cold pint of lager. A great blend of polka/metal and folk. i hope to hear more of these crazy guys from Finland."

"event","It's always funny to me when i walk in our church wearing shirts of bands like the Sexpistols,Joy division,the Cramps and so on that people come up to me and tell me that they like it that i wear these shirts because they used to be punks and wavers themselves when they were young.They tell me lots of stuff and things they did in their punk period.It's funny and kinda ironic. Only a couple get offended by it but they don't say much.I guess they think i'm ok in Jesus wich i am ofcourse.A woman told me she hung out with the guys of Joy division in her students appartment in the late 70ies. I gave her a copy of the Cramps album Off the bone. She liked it because she's got lots of good memories with their music i guess.Like last sunday i came in wearing my Sexpistols shirt and my pastor started to sing ""God save the queen"" from the Pistols. I was amased that he did that but i found it kinda cool in a way. The people in this church keep surprizing me with this sort of actions.But i think it's cool. I just thoughed it was kinda fun sharing it with you people"

"event","I've always been pro E.U. due to economical reasons and that the police within Europe can work together.But  i guess that the E.U. parlement people lost it along the way and want to move on to a European super state.Wich cityzen in Europe would want that??? We would have our own European president. Our own Bush. No thanks!It is kinda scary. I wouldn't want the Netherlands to be a province of Europe.They say that if the Netherlands would say no again to the referendum that we'll be kicked out of the E.U..If these guys would turn their big mouths to England,Sweden and Denmark, they could say the same about them because they haven't even got a euro in their pockets.Before they would point their finger at us.But what if we do get kicked out of the E.U.? Would we make it to support ourselves or would we totally be banned by the rest of these lunatics in Brusseles.I guess that our men in The Hague are ""debating"" on it with a cup of coffee and a piese of apple pie. These are exiting times we live in........"

"event","Mij date with Marije was cool. We met at Utrecht Central station at 2.I was all dressed in black with my Joy Division shirt on. She seemed ok with it. But i don't think it'll work out. She is a christian like me but not a goth and she has some ideas of her own about it. She's a vegeterian with vegan influences.I have some problems with her vegan part because i used to have a friend who is a ""vegan""( with leather couch).She tried to convert me to become a vegylover to.No thanks i love to eat meat.But Marije is not like that so that's a relieve.We got along nicely as the day passed. I noticed that she was carefull in picking the right words as i was just being myself. Perhaps she just wanted to keep herself toned down. But we made an appointment for another meeting.I have to say that i like her as a good friend and she liked me to as a friend or more i don't know.What i do know is that i'm very happy that i dated her and i found out that i ain't ready yet to start a new relationship with someone. I guess i finnaly start to enjoy myself doing things alone or with good friends."

"event","I had a church conferance last week and all fired up for Jesus. Hopefully i can keep that vibe in me alive for as long as possible.All and well when i opened the news paper this morning in the train to work. All full of death and destruction.War here,riots there,global warming,polaticians threaten each other with bombings and so on.Very positive. Uhuh!Sometimes i think we've all gone mad aspecially political leaders. They think they can do whatever you know. Blablabla. My guess is this, when the global madness has reached it's highest point i just sit down with a pint of beer and enjoy the fireworks.Than that song Miss Saigon pops in my head and we'll sing loudly ""...and we will all go down together"".I mean what else can you do apart from running around? Weird enough with all this lunacy around you start appreciating life more than you used to. At least that goes for me."

"event","As temperatures in the Netherlands are rising i really dread the summer! It's not that i dislike the summer but i can't stand temperatures above 25C. Last year it broke the record of highest temperatures of the sentury. 36,6C. That year i nearly passed out because of the heat. This year we hardly had a winter only one day of snow and that's it. I missed the snow and frost. But oh well global warming i suppose.I remember 10 years ago that me and some school mates were cycling over frozen lakes wich was a cool thing to do or play football ( even funnier afte a couple of drinks). I guess that won't happen again. Perhaps i should move to Norway or Sweden........."

"event","Nostalgia in the Akhnaton in Amsterdam was a cool party. Sadly it was very small and crampy.The more people came the hotter it got.But musical wise it was very good. They played anything from batcave to industrial.There were 2 performance acts where i totally had no idea what they were all about so i'd rather got out to get some fresh air or getting a drink at the bar.But i hope they would soon find a better venue than small ones like the Akhnaton. But yes nostalgic it was because it's where Medusa all started before moving to a cool venue like the Force. I wonder if th Force is still there because they wanted to trash it down to build another shoppingcenter. Like Amsterdam hasn't got enough of those things already. I'm looking forward to another goth party. Bring it on."

I came a little later so i missed Faderhead and by the time i got in Diorama was already in full effect. I enjoyed the gig dough the sound was sometimes a bit messed up.Perferator 23 was cool. I enjoyed their show. The band is a parody of everything gothic stands for. Go for it girls!! The dj's also did a great job afterwards. I'm looking forward to Nostalgia in AMSTERDAM"

"event","I feel like sliding away
in darkness i fall like quicksand
i feel a touch in the dark
i grasp but can not reach
standing an a beach
as the wind strokes my hair
with the sky so dark

i feel a touch of love
in this darkness
as i've lost faith in my surroundings
will You descend from above
to hold me and melt my frozen heart

what have i got to lose
as i surrender myself
to the purest form of love
i will choose
Your love gave me a reason to live

Your hands that raised me
from the desolate fields
where lonelyness rules
a place for lost fools
untill You showed me a way
to a better day

my soul
screams to be touched
screams to be loved
lonelyness is killing
my heart needs refilling

consumed by emptyness
it rains in my heart
i feel the love depart
as my soul turns cold

i've tasted love 
and i crave for more
see me on my knees
endarkening to my core

Ancient Spirit
catch me i'm falling
Ancient Spirit
hear me calling

Spirit who was,is and is to be
grant me love and life to see
enlighten my darkened heart
embrace my soul,never to let me go

for darkness is surrounding me
come swiftly,make haste
catch me i'm falling
Ancient Spirit
hear me calling
i'm in need of Thee

"event","Freitag the goth party in Leiden was very cool.I've met new people and of course people i allready knew. The music was great and so was the vibes. I prayed during the party and i felt God's spirit moving in to the venue wich was cool. There was a great atmosphere after that. I bought 2 compilation cd's wich are cool. i tried to look for stuff by Eva O but the guy at the cd stand didn't have any. On the way back i had to change trains at Amsterdam central where i had to wait 1,5 hours till the first train home but lucky me my work was close by so i went to get a coffee to kill some time. When i got home it felt like i worked night shift but that's not so weird if yer up for 28 hours. Gothic greets and blessings,Mordekai"

<lj-cut text=""Incoherent ramblings.""><lj-cut>I've been thinking a lot lately about ... stuff.  Lots of random things that I shouldn't be thinking about or I don't want myself to think about.  It seems like whenever you don't want yourself to think about something, you usually wind up thinking about it anyway, and all the time for that matter.  It's a pretty hopeless situation.  I was listening to Plumb while doing my PreCalc, and it sorta put me in a melancholy mood.  Especially ""Damaged"" ... I feel damaged most of the time.  I feel like I'm not the way I supposed to be, whatever that means.  Damaged as in missing something?  Maybe.  Missing... what?  Solace I guess.  Perhaps not so much with myself, but with others around me.

I find myself attracted to people who are in no way like me.  Maybe because I feel that they have something I don't, and whatever that is, I need it.  Or not.  Or maybe it's that rebellious streak, disregarding authority, wanting something just because I know it's ""bad"" and I can't have it.  ""Having is not so pleasing a thing as wanting; it is illogical but often true.""  I agree.</lj-cut>

Truth is what it is.  It will always be, no matter what you think or what you do.  You cannot warp it, you cannot twist it to what you feel it should be.  There are absolute standards, whether you like it or not.  And no matter how much you try to reason with yourself, trying to convince yourself that your selfish little ideas are acceptable, you are just digging a deeper hole.  And someday you're going to be in a darkness so thick, so blinding, you won't be able to discern where you went wrong.  But I pray to God it won't be too late."

"event","I know I haven't posted on what I thought of school, so I guess I'll do it now while I have some free time.  I'm stealing your format, Land.

AP European History (Hour 1, Fleet):  This has got to be my favorite area of history.  The class mainly consists of seniors, so I feel like I'm on an equal footing with everyone.  Well, everyone except for Max who is some kind of a genius freak.  But this class is definitely a good way to start my morning.

PreCalc (Hour 2, Cornell):  The only word I can think of to describe this class is ""meh"".  I've never liked math.  So far the work isn't that hard, and I hope I'll be able to understand everything we cover this year.

AP U.S. History (Hour 3, Fons):  As just about everyone else has already said, Fons is insane.  The man is radically liberal and rants about many things.  And participation is one-third of our grade so right now I don't like this class too much.  If there's anything I have a mortal fear of, it's public speaking and giant insects/arachnids.  

Lunch (Hour 4):  Crowded, crowded, crowded.  There are too many annoying freshmen.  The only good thing is that I have it with a good amount of my friends.

Pre-AP English 11 Honors (Hour 5-6, White):  I really like this class.  Mr. White is very laid back and an all-around cool guy.  We'll be studying The Crucible, The Great Gatsby, and many other awesome books this year, so I'm satisfied.

Intro to Greek Life & Lit (12:30 - 1:45 MW at UWM, D. Mulroy) - We're reading The Iliad by Homer right now, and after that we read The Odyssey.  My professor seems like a nice guy and he's not too boring when giving a lecture.  This girl that sat next to me started talking to me and she seems nice.  There's also a guy with dreads ... I'll have plenty to look at this semester.  Heh."

Since attendance has been down some thirty percent this summer, Milwaukee County will be closing around six of their pools on August 17th.  I know Matt was talking about us possibly closing on that day.  I would like the extra vacation time before school starts, but I could definitely use the money for working those days.  Hrm.

I hate clothes shopping with my brother.  I always feel so pressured to buy crap from American Eagle, just because he works there.  And every time I go in there, I always think ""Maybe this time, I'll find something.""  Except for their sweaters, I never do.  I hate all that trendy crap.

It was Nadia.  Yay yay.  We got to talk for awhile since I didn't have anything to do really.  She's such a great girl.  So funny.

Being ditched (sometimes) by your best friend because of a significant other is something I have definitely felt before.  It's not a good feeling...not a bit...life cannot be fair it seems.  But I hope you're feeling better, dear.

<b>EDIT:</b> And I'm gonna shut my mouth about the above said.  Kelly is neutral.

I had to go to Bradford Beach yesterday morning at 7:00 AM to take pictures with all the parkies and lifeguards.  It took well over an hour.  *rolls eyeballs*  I saw a girl I knew in middle school.  Apparently she's a lifeguard.  We didn't talk, but I think she recognized me.  Bad memories...damn preppy clique.  I'm so glad she doesn't work at Sheridan.  I got to see Karl, too.  So it wasn't a total waste of time.  I was just kinda peeved that I had to wake up so early.

Ah crap...Katherine Hepburn died today at age 96.  I guess I sorta expected it at any time since she was so old.  Farewell, Eleanor of Aquitaine.

Ah me...what have I been feeling lately?  Not much of anything.  I was thinking this afternoon what I would be doing exactly ten years from that time, at that exact moment.  Would I still be alive?  Would I be married?  Would I be anything like I am right now?  I guess I was mostly thinking about if I would still be alone.  There are some days when it hurts so much, not to be able to have someone I can share my life with.  There are some days when I beg God to let me have someone...I turn a tear-streaked face towards the sky in a desperate effort to see something of the heavenlies.  But I think God wants me to me happy with myself first, happy with Him within me, before He'll allow someone else to be within me as well.  Maybe I'm talking nonsense to you here, but it's starting to become clearer to me every day.  But it's hard...so hard...  So hard to let Peace overtake me.  I've had offers in the past...but I never felt right about it.  There was always that lingering doubt.  Was I scared?  Yes.  But in the end, it will all be okay.  In the end...I can rest easy."

Work was fine...I handled the baskets (i.e. sat there most of the day since not many people came, and since still fewer bought baskets for storage).  Heh.  But that's just fine...I wasn't feeling up to doing anything strenuous.  I have off on Monday!  So...if anyone wants to do something, just give me a call.  I went to Half-Price Books this morning and I got a copy of <i>Ben-Hur</i> (which I have wanted to read for a long time) and a copy of <i>Jude the Obscure</i> (which I have also wanted to read).  Nifty.  I guess that's all for now...au revior kiddies."

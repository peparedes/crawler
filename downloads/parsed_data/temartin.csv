"event","So im semi-liar. I just like to humor people. To be quite honest, I feel like I often say things that I dont mean...just in agreeance...things I dont want to mean.  And you may ask me why?  I am an irrational thinker.  In the moment it seems like the logical approach, but then after, my train of thought leads me to the conclusion that Iiii really dont know what i was thinking. Hmmm...surprising how that works out.
  In reference to the (side note---limptrisket is a little bit dirty) previous sentimental irrationality,life moves on.  My mom told me i have no time for stupidity...and all boys are under that category, because boys are accessories.  However, she also said white after labor day is under stupidity too, so i concur that stupidity has a broad range of categories within this larger phylum.  
  I find it so much easier talking to people i dont know as oppose to people i do know.  Not only do i not get bored bc there is always something new to learn, but it leaves hope of gaining a new prospect for all the things i need to do in my life that want partner to join in.
  My roomate has tried on several different shirts as of now and has no idea that each one of them looks just as good.  What is it with girls?  Do you not realize that your gorgeous and that makes every shirt just as flattering as the last.  But what really flusters me is why worry about your shirt, your automatically pretty, maybe consider the jungle your sleeping in.  We always new that live organisms, such as that from the Phylum Antropoda, would at one point inhabit your place of rest.   WaTcH OuT BoYs....shes hot, but shes got more in the sheets than you think.
  My other roomate wants a tongue ring...her mom's the head of the church, her dad's the head of the cemetary, and she frequents catholic retreats and non-alcoholic beverages.  Enough said.
  Nonetheless I heart her very much....and her deviant sibling.  PS lady, be safe on friday...limptrisket seems likes he's needin a lil somein somein. But I know your good.
  I miss sex and the city. It made me feel so much better about having to go through another week.  Come back to me...and give me some good tips.  I need them. I have bad luck.
  So 1-800-i have a staring problem.  Yes, yes i do.  You know what i love, when my staring problem is so out of control, that the poor victim whom is my focus gets so uncomfortable that they need to address me and ask if i need something.  Thats wonderful.  
  In terms of sex and the city, this is how i would like to conclude this random addtion....

 Thanks jen...i stole it out of your profile.  you probably dont read this anyways so i dont care.

"event","you wanted an entry that could make you laugh,
and i know at one time you made me.
you wanted to chat, 
to just shoot the shit,
but the shit reversed its ways.
you wanted to be with me,
to sleep by my side,
but phone calls were too far away.
you wanted a friend,
one to whom you could say goodnight,
i gave you hours of secrets to save.
you wanted my trust,
to be only mine,
but you wanted conveniece as well.
you wanted the feelings,
the ones you said to me,
to come back straigt to you.
when i finally came around,
and found what i felt,
it fell into 'im falling for you.'
you wanted to come here,
to see how it went, 
you wanted to find out how much...
the i want to see you's,
the i only think of you's,
felt while your feeling my touch.
when you layed next to me,
and kissed me goodnight,
i knew it was something more than lust.
because when i woke up next to you, 
and thought you wanted to run away,
you held me and ignored what was done.
you wanted to call me,
you wanted to tell me,
how hard and how unfair all of this is.
you wanted to show me,
that this connection,
was something more than just friends.
but what you failed to want,
what you failed to share,
throughout this entire saga,
was the feelings you've hidden,
the feelings of falling through,
the feelings of not working out.
and now its hard,
even though we havent tried,
and so easy just to back down.
we'll i solute you sir captain,
and give you my best,
but its nothing to be proud of.
you didnt hurt me as bad as you think,
my spirits arn't broken down.
but you've showed me how strong that i really am,
because i know i wasnt the one who let go.
i've been through times much much harder than this,
to the point where i might of lost a life.
but the fact that when something so good,
withstands one obstacle,
you fall right to the ground--
tells me your right,
we're not meant to be,
and i'm willing to move on and out.

although i am hurt,
and feel torn a part,
because the words i said we're so true.
i know you didnt mean to do this,
and i know who you are,
and for a memorable time,
i wish the best to you.

you wanted an entry,
you wanted some fun,
you wanted so much i cant give to you.
i want to wish that we had let a vacation stay a vacation, 
so i would not have felt so strongly for someone as wonderful as you."

"event","We pick and choose the paths we take, and sometimes in this decision making process we choose the wrong route.  Theme of the week.
  Back to school is always an adjustment.  At home we find comfort in not wearing make up, utlizing scrubs to the maxim limit, and carelessly laugh, joke, let lose of anything existing outside the premises of your comfort zone.  On the drive back to school, your in a middle zone; your saddened by the fact that the laziness your so accustomed to has ended, but you have hope that your dolled up and diligent efforts will strike a difference in the way other people who your not comfortable with, view you.  
  I'm looking around my room right now and noticing that 80% of my wall is decorated in photographs of fun times, 10% is matted and aestheically pleasing magazine motivation ads, and the other 10% is posters with representations that describe myself.  It's kind of funny how we define ourselfs by the things that we see in order to take place of a feeling or memory we once had but can never forget.  Even the materials on my desk hold the same value.  It's not likely that I'll use the five bottles of hand lotion sitting around; but the fact that the bottles are so intricately designed with a figure or symbol that draws my attention gives me the motivation to display all five of them.  Is this a reminder that I'm a distinct person who displays her characterisitics between sight or am I an idiotic consumer of false advertising?  Clearly the fact that I sit here and take the time to debate this in my head shows that I need to progress in other areas, such as my social life.
  Even though I am a proud Bostonian I'm not going to hold back...we are a little out of control.  Driving in Boston through rush hour traffic is a never-ending battle no matter how many lanes and highways we keep adding on.  My favorite experience in Boston, which has occured multiple times, is finding a parking space.  Driving down one way streets lined by meters and cars that double park is not unusual in this city.  But after scrambling your way through this maze, there ahead, in the distance, is one open space to park.  You eye it as if your proclaiming ownership over it, and you anxiously wait for the moron in front of you to hit the gas pedal and move the hell out of your way.  Right when you approach your space, the asshole driving next to you cuts you off, to the point of causing a potential accident and steals your rightfully unattained space.  There is nothing you can do to get it back.  The only thing left is to roll down your window while giving the finger, yell that's mine you f*ck, cough up a cup of mucus and spit it out the window...Then you hit the gas as hard as you can because you know a smug SOB with a nerve like that has a bat in his back seat. Because in order to be a Bostonian and to share that aggressive mentality (which is so common), you drive prepared for anything that comes your way.  Yet, what I find particularly ridiculous is who really has ownership of the road...the cars or the pedestrians?  Green light Go...all of a sudden a hand with an sbux coffee cup goes up in the air commanding your vehicle to hault.  Mindlessly walking across a four lane road during oncoming traffic, why, because that the white coller jerk with the sbux cup has an agenda.  Whatever happened to cross walks...oh, they're there, just not utilized, because Boston has taken on this new concept that the pedestrian who just took public transportation to get into the city has control over the driver of a 5000 lb operating piece of machinery.  New Flash fon slice, I just drove an hour and a half through rush our traffic to make it to my appointment, so you can shove your sbux up your ass and wait for the red light.  I think we should take the Canadian way of thinking.  Try jay walking up there and the cars accelerate.  I swear, you walk into the road and the car is a half mile away they dont slow down, theyll drive right around you if they can make it...otherwise they risk the chance of hitting you; or do they really?  Yea, Canadians have little value for pedestrians, but I think the purposely try to run over Americans.  Point of the matter...the rules of traffic and pedestrians in Boston needs some work."

"event","I'm a little late on writing my update I'm afraid and I apologize for any inconvenience.  I am aware that there are people in this world who fill their free time with my live journal entries and I applause you for utilizing your free roaming minutes of life with my entertainment service that embodies the main goal of providing its clientele with a rewarding opportunities.  What those rewarding opportunities are I dont know,  your the ones reading this you find the reason as to why you continue to pursue this text.  My piece today entails an array of subjects that hints upon the most recent topics that I have engaged, observed, and analyzed over the past month. I hope you all enjoy and attest to the fact that not only do I appreciate your business, but I also hope you wonderful people continue to remain my avid readers.
  First thing is first.  I have recently returned back to my residence at the Bertrand Hall of St. Anselm College.  The second I stepped foot in the front entry way, memories of first semester were brought back to me so vividly it is almost as I never left.  The smell of mold in the hallways, the dust circulating the over-ventilated rooms, the hairs on the walls of the bathroom showers--its just like home.  Although these descriptions may sound rather grotesque, I'm not gonna lie, I kind of enjoy this poorly maintained and ancient dormitory.  Note to self, it is not poorly maintained due to the cleaning ladies, they are wonderful people who work hard and are always so pleasant when you visit them while they're smoking their cigarettes in the front corridor or taking breaks to watch General Hospital. It just so happens that the building is simply falling a part.  And you know what?  I like it this way.  It give it a sense of distinction, a clear photographic memory that can last for years and define a period of my life.  But as clear as it was the Berty hasn't congealed as much as I thought it would over the period of winter break, there has been one new addition that I would like to protest.  The Bathroom Radio.  I don't understand these people, and I don't understand their actions, and I don't understand their blindness.  Let's start with the reality of the situation and then we'll move towards the facts.  Now I am a music lover.  It is how I fall asleep at night, it is how I wake up in the morning, it is how I detach myself from the stresses of life, it is a significant figure of my life.  In all honesty, I feel like if I did not have music in my life, I would never find an escape from the reality I am always living.  But my pet-peeve about the radio being in the Bertrand showers is as follows.  First, what is the necessary need to listen to the radio in the showers of your dormitory when a) no one spends more than thirty seconds in the shower bc there is a 75% chance that your going to come out of the shower dirtier than when you went in due to the fungus growing within that enclosed space behind the curtain.  b) what has the world come to when people can't even be mentally stable enough to spend 'the amount of time it takes to take a shower' with themselves; we now need an entertainment service to get us through the stress of having to be alone with our being for the duration of time it takes to shampoo, condition, and caress. AND C) which is the ultimate faultiness of the radio-in-the-shower- is that IT DOESNT WORK.  HELLO, are u people deaf...IT--DOESN'T---WORK.  I don't know if people have been immune to the sounds of daily life for so long that they can't even tell the difference between what sounds are audio pleasing and what sounds are an audio annoyance.  Everytime I walk into the F-n bathroom all I hear is these little blond grls giggles of ""oh my god i know, this shower radio is amazing.  Wow its really great.""  As the staticy zizzzzzing noise is playing in the background.  There has even been a time when I've walked into the bathroom and some girl engaging in her nightly ritual of face wash, lotion, and tweesing is singing along to Celine Dion, A New Day Has Come.  As she and Celine were in the groove, it would be just about every two seconds that Celine would be taken over by a zizzzzing noise for a good 7 seconds, leaving this poor girl, who definetly needed the assistance of Celine, to help her out seeing as she wasnt' regulating her vocal cords through this static duration. And to top it off, I thought that since this girl was partially hard of hearing (seeing as though she was participating in this twisted version and mockery of a good song) I was thinking maybe she doesnt recognize my presence in the bathroom.  But after this entire outbreak of insanity, she turns to me as I'm brushing my teeth and says, ""Dont you just love this shower radio."" You wanna know my answer, you wanna know my answer.  NO, NO I DO NOT ENJOY THIS PIECE OF CRAP SHOWER RADIO< AND I CERTAINLY DONT ENJOY YOUR PARTICIPATION IN ENHANCING THIS INDESCRIBABLE PAIN DESTROYING MY HEARING WHICH IS TRAVELING TO MY BRAIN, CAUSING A MIGRANE. NO.  So anyways to all audio-blinded Bertrand residents, come to your senses, use some cu-tips, or invest in a hearing device to assist your shortbusness.
  Some of you may need to take a break from reading, I know that I have those times, so if your about to take a fiver I suggest you do it now--I plan on switching subjects.  So I plan on devoting an entire entry to Montreal, but that will be for later times.  I'm about to write about something now that has always been on my mind.
  I know its so weird that I in this live journal, I write about some things that I'm afraid to say person, or even at all, so instead I say it indirectly to the world over the internet.  I don't know, I guess it just makes some things easier.  But something that is really bothering, that always bothers me, like any other girl is the quality of my dating life.  I feel like over the past five years, I have met so many different guys, and dated different guys, but the only thing I have accomplished in doing so is that I have found everything that I don't want in my ideal guy.  Which I suppose is a good thing because it sets limitations and allows me to find out what i do want.  But at times part of me is almost scared to open up.  Like any other normal person I dont like thinking about the fear and fact that at anytime a relationship can totally end, and ill be stuck in the mode of having to repair.  In the past I've had some real rocky experiences that although I've learned from, still have a soar spot whenever they come up.  But I suppose that through all this mess and bull-shit, I still have the mentality go for it anyways, you never know what can happen.  And i know i'm young, I know i have so much time, but I also recognize that I have a huge fear of any commitment for the sole purpose that I never want to get stuck.  I never want to be in the place where I feel as though I'm limited, as though I might change, I might lose who I am.  Thus, there are many times I end relationships before I ever really chance them. In my past experiences, I think that there have been so many times that I was afraid of getting rejected, that I would almost completely devote myself to trying to make it work, that I over-looked the fact that I was actually being hurt during the relationship.  Now don't intepret this in the wrong way, I'm a tough kid and I'm not easily swindeled.  I know that I'm extremely confident and I'm not afraid to say what I feel.  But do I feel like there are sometimes, irregular occasions, when I find myself forgetting who i am and what i want, because I'm willing to like someone else just as much.  And that is never good.  So end result, my goal is to wait it out...to see what happens, to continue to take these dating risks, but to remember that it might not work out, even if i want it to.  Because there are certain things i want in a guy, I want to feel wanted, I want to feel needed, and I want to never change--I am willing to believe that 'everything in life is temporary, because everything changes, thats why it take great courage to commit, knowing it might end anytime, but having the faith that it may not.'  But in the meantime, I'll keep up with my priorities and trust that fact that it will all work out.  Until nexttime, live happy, dream big, and think wise. Kisses to you.
P.S> S.Kane you are of live journal recognition and you know that if you make it to the live journal you have some potential, either that or you're a representation of notoriety.  But I would like to congratulate you on maintaining that jungle you sleep in, I havent found any strange objects such as macaroni and cheese bowls, straighteners, or library books with in the sheets.  And I'm also pleased that you have upgraded your memory system in order to detect the location of your student identification within 5.35 minutes.  You are granted an A for the day."

"event","To all my avid readers out there, I owe you an apology for I haven't been consistent with my entries.  But please understand, that the concept, definition, and meaning of the word finals constitutes a detailed explanantion as to why I have partially abandoned you, and I'm sorry.  To be quite honest, I think finals should almost be condsidered illegal, they contain the components equivalent to that of a drug.  Finals force people to stay awake hours upon hours of the day to the point of sleep deprivation.  They change the mindset and attitude of people, they bring down ones self-esteem, and they ruin the meaning of good-work.  Now it is not the person taking the final who chooses to do so, it is society at large.  Society forces  the drug of finals into the throat of the next generation, the ones who will be in charge of the world.  They brainwash into being trained robots that follow certain orders and memorize certain formulas.  I don't agree with finals, they're societies drug.
  I like being home but I don't like being home.  I like the fact that when I go to cut a piece of fruit, I am able to do so because my knife at home has ridges.  I like being able to shower without sandals on, and not have the fear that if I touch a part of the shower I will be diseased.  Yet, I don't like having to resort to the nordic trac or tredmill on a Sat. night.  As much as I love those low key nights, I fear that I am going to have an abundant amount of them this month.  Not to say that I don't love my friends, but I haven't really seen them yet, and it doesn't seem that they are making such a large effort to come see me.  And I can understand why, the holidays are crazy and everyones busy, and there is lots to be done in such a sort period of time.  But Montreal should be fun, I am rather excited for that.  Yet, I miss my friends at school, it is so weird moving from one totally different setting to another.  As much as I dont mind it, the transition sets a feeling that is very distinct and memorable.
  I never saw blue like that before, across the sky, around the world.  Your giving me all you have and more, and no one has ever shown me how.  To see the world the way I see it now, oh I, I never saw blue like that."

"event","Sometimes when people talk to me, I can't understand what they're saying.  I don't think that it's because they mumble, I think that as I gradually age my hearing begin to depletes. This situation takes place very often in my day.  The typical response of a normal person would most likely be, ""what did you say?""  But I don't like to play that game, because even when they repeat it, I still don't understand what they're saying.  Thus, I give a response to a question or comment I didn't hear.  For example, today I encountered a muscular body, approximately 6 feet 4 inches, brown hair and brown eyes.  I was talking to my friend about my screen name and I assumed that since he was in a reasonable distance he was listening to our conversation.  When I finally got this ab fabulousness to approach me, words came out of his mouth, words which I could not decifer.  But from the look on his face, it seemed as though he was asking a question.  I told him what my screen name was, because logically my previous conversation would indicate so, and he his faced progressively developed into a confused state.  I heard the what come out of his mouth, so I repeated my screen name, and then when I again realized he could not comprehend my words, I told him I would tell him in biology.  He shook it off as a 'whatever,' this grl is special ed, and then he backed it up for me.  He walked closer to me, and in slower, clear words, he repeated his question...'I asked what your name was.'  I felt like a loser, because one, i thought he already knew who I was, and two I tried progressing a relationship with a really hot kid by giving him my screen name---assuming he already knew my real name.  Well, I knew his real name, but thats because I'm like that.  Hell, it any girl says she's not a researcher (a.k.a= stocker) then she is lying.  Because the truth of the matter is that all females are 'researchers.'  It's like we were born with a certain persona that motivates us to be this way--i'm not going to deny it, I have nothing to hide, whatever you have you might as well throw on the table, Right? Right t.martin, atleast you agree with yourself.  Hey, sometimes you only need yourself to agree with yourself--to be honest thats the way it is most of the time for me, because as Pap would always say ""99.9 % of the world is handicapped.""  And you know what, i think its true.  Although i'm probably among that large majority, I'd still like to think otherwise.  Keep the Peace in the middle East."

"event","Today is a burberry day.  Because it is a burberry day, anything that I don't do, that I'm suppose to do doesn't matter.  I am declaring today to be a burberry day.  I'm not making my bed, it's still just a matress with the sheets on the floor.  I am going to eat all the congo bars B.Green made for me, sitting next to my computer as I type.  But I can do this all because today is a burberry day. 
  A burberry day does not have defining characteritics.  It's just a day when I feel very burberry.  Maybe its the snow storm outside, or the Om perfume i'm wearing from gap, or even the neatness of my books on my desk: it just makes me feel very burberry.  
  I like to look at my Polo Ralph Lauren application that is half filled out.  It is not the concept that I might work there (because I won't be, Mom says its too far away), but it is more or less that fact that it is in my possession.  Like Polo was considering me.  Not that one should feel so priveledged for working there, but nonetheless, everyone loves the feeling of being wanted.  I wonder if that really counts if I was the one who asked for the application, it wasn't offered to me.  But scratch that, I enjoy having the ab fabulous feeling that I was almost a Polo girl; and I can have that feeling, because today my friends, is a burberry day.
  Venture out in the world, have a new experience, try something you don't think you'll like, screw up, fall down the stairs and have everyone laught at you--its a great feeling.  You'll realize that once all this craziness has happened and you don't care about anything in the world except the ben & jerry's ice cream your going home to, that you are having a burberry day.  So declare you burberry day, be independent, and live like no ones watching you.  Be burberry for once in your life.
  P.S.--it's january according to my computer, happy new year my little compaq."

"event","I was a little hesitant about coming home again.  I feel like I really needed too though.  There was something inside me that said it is now time to depart, it is now time to change the atmosphere, and it is now time to venture home.  Thanksgiving is a time to be together with those  you love, and a time to regroup with those you've drifted apart from.  
   I saw my friends, and it seems like we never left each others side.  The most wonderful part about not seeing your friends for a while is the fact that you can retell the stories like you like to talk about, the stories that your still interested in, the same stories that all the friends you've been recently hanging out with get sick of, again again and again, because your old friends haven't had the run through detail for detail--it's as if I never told the story before.  And the best part about is the fact that your old friends no you so well that they'll support you in anything, whether or not you made the right decision.
  Another part of me was holding back from becoming Needhamized again.  I left high school with a new outlook, and outlook that said your past is your past so never look back.  That's how I felt about attending the football game today.  I feel like I've seen the people I wanted to see, and for those who I haven't seen I plan on making it up over winter break.  The only part about that philosophy that makes me superficial is not the fact that ""I'm satisfied only seeing my real friends,"" but in part I'm scared to see those old acquantences.  Why, I don't know?  There are so many people I considered friends because we went out together, and there are other people who I literally try to avoid, because I'm scared how they may have changed and I don't really want to know how they've changed because I'm satisfied with the memory I have in my head.  The truth of the matter is that people fade away, the people you once considered friends become a part of old memories.  Yet, there is a bright outlook, because the friends you still have, the bond becomes stronger and you really value being together.
  The worst part about Thanksgiving is the relatives you try to avoid.  I honestly don't mind that much getting together, but it kind of bothers me that I feel more comfortable talking to a homeless person on a bench in Boston than I do conversing with my Uncle.  I can't help it and I can't handle it.  I'm just like please ignore me, because when  you come and talk to me we both know that we struggle to come up with the words to actually form a conversation.  It's just so weird how they kiss and hug you as if they really know you, but in actuallity I probably know the drunk kid who threw up on my shoe better than I know my own grandparents.  And they're sweet, they are really nice people, but its so hard--as you can read I would rather indulge in a peaceful session of writing and music than spend time participating in the holiday festivities.  
  All in all I'm glad to be home, I like that feel of bare feet on my floor, opening a refridgerator to get a drink, and watching football with my Dad in our basement.  It feels like home again.
  What I'll acheive in due time: I want to wake up feeling free, I want to dream as if I'll never die, I want to speak the words I feel with no regret, I want to hear what he means in complete silence--""I want to say it best when I say nothing at all""
P.S---How do I change the Date"

"event","Old feelings fade away.  At the time, in the moment, you think they'll last forever, but overtime they disappear almost as easily as they originally came.  Whenever your in a certain setting, you sometimes feel a rush run through your body reminding you of how you felt at one point in your life, but like anything else in the world-- they fade away.
    I thought that the verizon tower was knocked over yesterday.  When I woke up, I reached for my phone, tried to direct my calls to arrange my social life, only to find that the little bars at the top of the screen did not appear.  There would be no breakfast date at the caf. that morning for T.Martin.  I was thinking, wow, this is ab-fabulous, if not for the fact that I don't memorize anyones number, so I have to rely on my cell phone--the only people I can contact would be within walking distance of Saint Anselm College.  My social life crashed for the entire day.  It was a good opportunity to be productive in other ways--but don't worry I repaired.  My revelation erupted when I had the bright idea to shut off my phone last night at 11:30 due to a low power charge, only to find that when I turned it back on to check the time--> the bars reappeared.  Serves me right, the stupidity I displayed throughout the entire day subjected me to not an intelligent conclusion: to shut off the phone and see if the bars reappear, but to wait for the trial and error stage, which took 13 hours to complete in order to fix my cellular device.
      J.the bartender--although I never see you anymore, you are probably the most beautiful being ever.  I hope one day I'll see you again.  Isn't it weird to wonder how often you might go through someone elses' head?  I believe so."

"event","Sarah always says that head games are the way to go.  Rather than going to talk to your secret love, you need to play with their head.  Give them enough attention to make them want to come and talk to you, but never go out of your way to show that you want to give them attention.  My problem with these head games is that I get frustrated to easily and I am alreadys ready to attack.  I would say that in any relationship I have ever had, I've always been the one to initiate.  I don't know, I suppose I like the chase for a while, but then I'm ready to speed things up--keep things going.  If there is no change in the environment that I am in, I get bored easily, and for that reason alone, I go through boys as quick as I go through my outfits.  A new season calls for a new waredrob. 
      Today has been a blah day, nothing too good and nothing too bad.  I kind of like those days once in a while.  As much as people say they hate cloudy and rainy days, I have to admit, I am a huge fan.  During days like today, the wind is suttle; the air is fresh, and when you breath it in, you can almost taste the air (if that makes any sense at all).
       I also think that the weather today, along with some other factors, has helped clear my head and prioritize my values.  Last night I from my sister informing me that my mom's mri results have shown that her tumor is regrowing.  My family and I have been dealing with these technical difficulties since last December.  I've remember myself saying at the time of this discovery, that I had grown up more during the first two weeks experiencing this tragedy than I had in seventeen years.  It has now been close to a year, and I can still feel myself growing and adapting to my everchanging life style.  The reason I bring this topic up is because I've gotten to comfortable and too caught up in my own life, that I had forgotten what it was like to be in that stage of fear that I was in for the first six months of this year.  My mom had gone on a treatment, and it appeared as though her tumor was being regulated, so she took a break in June.  She has been so positive and strong through this process that at time I forget that there is anything wrong with her.  And I think since the beginning of this school year, I've been locked in that self-centered stage, and I needed something to kick me out of it.  I was shocked when I heard the news, but something inside tells me that everything is going to be okay.  I believe that everything happens for a reason, and maybe somethings happen to the best of people because some higher forces are trying to send out a message to all of us; What is really important?  Is it really important that I have stupid boy problems, is it really important that I didnt get the grade I want, is it really important that my over the pant fat doesnt make my jeans fit right anymore?  No.  Whats important is what you find inside other people, how they change you, and how they can effect you when their life is threatened.  It may sound so strange but I've been saying this since the beginning, things happen for a reason, its the way its meant to be, and as much as I wish this wasnt happening to mother (because im selfish and i know i cant live without her, I'm glad to be able to say that 'I can see beyond the obvious.'  So the truth of the matter is that I dont know how this Thanksgiving is going to go.  My mother is either going into surgery or starting chemo so what it comes down to is that I dont think its going to be a typical Thanksgiving.  But I have come to the realization that this year, like our last Christmas in Brigham and Womens', my family will be celebrating our holiday the way its meant to be: with a close-knit, united tie thats bonds us together.  Whether it be around our dinner table, or in a hospital room I will learn to value the true meaning of Thanksgiving, I'm thankful to be apart of their lives.
    I apologize if this entry isn't the typical humourous reading that I normally like to display.  But nonetheless, I think it portrays an important meaning that everyone should be accustomed too.  And not deter my readers, but I write in this journal more for myself than anyone else.  The live journal gives me the opportunity to express everything that I want to be able to say, but sometimes have trouble saying outloud.  I'm usually not one for corny lines or emotional tales, but then again it would be superficial to say that I'm never a victim of the heart."

"event","Aol and aim are so hypocritical.  I'd like to think that Aol was dominant over aim, but tonight I found out the hard way that thats not the case.  I sometimes like to pretend that I am pulling a fast one by signing on to aim, putting up and away message, and then sign on to aol at the same time so I can frolic on the internet.  I assumed that since I already had an away message up that there is no necessary need to put up another one.  And I also figured that since my away message was up to only reason no one was iming me was because they are too lazy to write a message to a person who wouldn't be responding anyway.  That's how I look at it anyway, people are too lazy to give the whats up if there is no one there to respond.  Note to self, this is how I view other people.  For myself in particular, I am not a fan of the this piece of technology.  Well in actuality, I'm not a fan of communicating throught the use of the computer, I mean to be quite honest usually dont check my mail for weeks upon weeks--its just so boring; and I HATE writing e-mails, they're lame.  So I would be that rare case of a person who enjoys talking to the away message, because I dont like to utlize my time on this piece of machinary. And to be quite frank, half of the time im online, the conversations are usually the regular 'whats up hows school' deal.  Something that can be communicated through leaving away messages.  I would prefer the average hello I havent forgot about you message over, give me the summary of your life since we've last talked which has been about two weeks ago.  The point of this conversation is that I was tricked tonight.  I was signed on to aim with an away message up and then I signed on to aol to write in my live journal, because I've been receiving external pressures from my roommate to do so.  As soon as I signed on I got the 'hey whats up deal,' from a person who I just recently talked to their away message before putting up mine.  I've learned two things from this fiasco.  One, aim away messages dont cover your ass on aol, and two, I'm nowhere near captain popular, because I originally thought ppl didnt wanted to talk to my away message they wanted to talk to me in person--where as in actuality, they could have talked to me in person because I was signed on the entire time.  Way to feel like I cool kid.  
    Even though the outbreak with the aim vs. aol makes me feel like a loaner, I have pictures all around my room that make me feel like a cool kid.  I think the reason why is because my pictures are of so many different people.  I love when people comment on my pictures, it makes me feel like I've acheived something.  It influences me to take more and more and more pictures just so I can indulge in the greedy pleasure of having other people look at them.  The only part I dont like to admit in this situation, is that I dont really know half the people in these moments of time.  In order to justify that I'm still a cool kid, I refer to the people in those pictures as my friends at of that era.  I suppose they were, even though in some cases I only hung out with them one night-- but I mostly still remember there names so it must be a kosher situation.  But dont frett, I do have literal friends-- they happen to present in multiple pictures so you can pick them out easily.  It's funny, pictures on you wall should change like your waredrob of the season--some just go out of style so easily as you friends change so frequently.  But there are some friends to keep for ever, they're like that plain black shirt that never goes out of style because black is such a universal and transcending color; you can never go wrong with them.

"event","I've decided that I hate the live journal process.  Everytime I write a good entry its always freaking deleted for some idiotic reason.  P.S. The Journal entry I JuSt WrOtE was about my navigation skills in the White Mountains.  This weekend I went up to my house in Waterville Valley with my two friends.  I tried bringing them to certain tourist sites, but it seemed rather impossible considering that I had no idea how to get anywhere.  Yes, I have been resided in that area for 12 years.  Its kosher how it took me and hour and half to get to a destination that should have only taken a good twenty minutes. I concluded that it was the darkness that through me off only to find that the next day I totally contradicted myself when I got lost another two times, and again I prolonged short half hour rides to a good hour and fifteen minutes.  Atleast the designated driver is a naturally patient person and the back seat passengers chackled the whole time becaues thats her trademark.  The mission of the weekend was to purchase skis, but due to my prior purchase of a two sizes too small polo shirt, I needed to peace out of the N.H. action early in order to make the outlets before they closed.  Not to mention that my failure as captian navigation condensed that amount of time I had to make it to the ski store in time.  Yet, despite all this craziness, my vaca away from school was low key, eventful, entertaining, and fun.  And despite my rejected hypothesis that I believe it was the darkness detering my keen driving skills I still faithfully believe that under different circumstances I could have successfully reached my destinations in better timing.  P.S- I am a good driver when I am behind the way,  I simply get distracted by the conversations within the vehicle so it is applicable that I would miss certain turns along the way."

"event","I can convince myself to do anything.  You never have to worry whether or not I'm doing something because I want to or because I'm being forced into it.  Whether or not its right or wrong, I can convince myself that whatever it is I am doing can be justified in some way.  Today I went to Burger King and told myself that I can get two orders of chicken fingers, because chicken doesn't have carbohydrates.  I told myself that I didn't need to go to my humanities lecture because my teacher wouldn't be in class today, and before the final I would go to the library and listen to all the lectures that I missed.  I also didn't attend my biology lecture today either, because I naturally understand how the human body works. If someone were to tell me that I am making the Fonniest mistake of my life, it wouldn't matter because I can fabricate some bullshit ab fabulous reason as to why what I am doing is morally correct for myself.  Am I just really confident in decisions or am I avoiding the truth of reality?
    I don't think I've managed to make it through a day without having some type of incident happen when I either fall or am close to a fatal injury.  Today I almost got hit by a car.  I was walking to utilize my roommates explorer when all of a sudden a loud excruciating horn noise vibrates through my  body.  I look back and without doubt a red compact car is not more that a foot away from me still moving.  Overwhelmed by the fact that I was about to be taken out by a rolling car I literally jumped out of the way, caught my heel on the bottom of my pants, and rolled my ankle to the side until I could maintain my balance.  It was sly.  But not as sly as last week when I crossed the street going to St.marys, pulled another ankle rolling action, this time completely wiping out to the point that I was laying in the middle of the street sprawled out. It wasn't until the oncoming traffic in both directions realized that I wasn't planning on getting across the street within the normal time frame; thus, multiple brakes were slammed on un-expectantly. I've decided I can't even be embarrassed by incidents such as these, because they are a common occurrence in a typical t.martin day."

"event","I would just like to point out that at this has been my third attempt to put up a life journal entry today.  Every time I seem to try to put up a journal entry, these shortbus advertisements about how to make yourself feel better keep coming up on my damn computer. They are basically shouting out, you should hate yourself and if you buy my product then maybe you'll start loving yourself while becoming a relatively okay looking person.  Honestly, the next time an advertisement pops up on my computer, I might track down the F**king company that sent it to me and sue them.  Although I am naturally a dramatic person, this is to an extreme.  Previously I had two really good entries that I rather enjoyed.  The first entry was about the art of pistachio nut cracking and how I am a Saint A's sports team abuser.  The second entry was about how I woke up in the most senseless state that I ever had in my life.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not going to reject the internet for the rest of my life, but I'm going to remain bitter about my last two entries because to be quite frank, they were probably some of the best pieces that I have created in the past 18 years.
      I hate over thinking.  It's one of my best and one of my worst features.  It's one of my best features, because I can think well.  It's one of my worst features because I get sick of it after a while.  That's why waking up this morning was one of the best experiences I've had in a while.  I glanced at the clock around 6:30 this morning, my eyes werent open for my than a half of second. I needed to close them.  I've never felt nothing before.  Literally nothing, to be explicit, I felt senseless; like my entire body was deadless--just a mass of something lying in bed.  My mind was like the sky, it had no direct beginning or end.  I have no recollection of what was going through my head, it wasn't cloudy, but wasn't clear.  I was just there.  I was scared to open my eyes.  The feeling of nothing is so rare, especially in my life, that I like to grasp it for as long as possible.
I think the only logical explanation for explaining this phenomenon is that lately I've been thinking too much.  I can never go to bed with something on my mind, because whenever there is a problem, it consumes my whole being.  My dad always said never go to bed mad--and I didn't, I went to bed without analyzing, without thinking, with nothing.  
   The showers at Bertrand are revolting.  My roommate always says that she comes out of the shower dirtier than when she went into it; I wouldn't be surprised, because Sarah 'doesn't lie.'  But the shower is a struggling state for more reasons then the fact that it's disgusting. It always bothers me how I can never shave.  I'm not one of those flexible girls that can bend in certain ways, or one of those girls who can maintain their balance by holding up one leg at a time.  I the girl that needs help holding myself up, because the snickers I eat on a regular basis go right to my thighs, so it becomes too much work having to lift up an entire leg.  Maybe shaving can wait for a while--it's too cold out and I'm sustaining from any intimate contact with the male genatalia for quite some time.  
    I havent seen Caitlin, Hil, or even Kristen for quite sometime; they're kosher, and I love them- as shortbus as they may be at times. They arn't literal shortbus, they are funny shortbus.  Cait is the more logical thinker, she believes life should always be 1/2 whoa.  If I were to compare her to anyone on sex and the city I would compare her to Charlotte even though I know she likes Keri more.  Hilary is the half whoa of my life.  She loves to do madonnas and the gym and keeps my entertainment level at maximum voltage.  She is a nymphomanic and has not problem telling anyone that she is so--not even the Needham Pool and Racket club workers when we go visit Caitlin, or the store clerks at Abercrombie.  K.Green--I can't remember the last time I saw that girl.  I feel as though she went to college and took a 180*.  I support every mistake she makes because she is one of my best friends and I truly enjoy her rebellious ways--but I hope she learns the relm of life: anything with a penis has the potential of being an asshole, don't be shocked when they are.  Now that isn't to say that all guys are like that because I'm sure some are awesome. But judging by the fact that I only attract two types of guys, Creeps and Assholes, I would'nt doubt if 75% of the male race made this qualification.
    I hate over the pant fat.  I get it everytime I sit down. You know college is starting to rub off on you when your legs start moving together as if they're one when you walk.  I use to try so hard to avoid that, but now I embrace it.  I think I'm the only girl at school who has under the normal amount of money left on her meal card.  Well, lady you know what it comes down to--enjoy lifes pleasures, not every stick shaped object that comes in 6 inches, has caramel, nugget, chocolate, pea nuts, and only 310 calories, so live it up while you can.  Thats all for now, peace in the middle east."

"event","Today is the first day of my life that I have used a live journal.  Although it is not the first day I have longed to use a live journal.  You see, I have quite the predicament on my hands, but it wouldn't be the first time that I do.  Over the past two weeks, I have been subjected to so many feelings that I did not even think existed in the human body, well that is not in the body of T.Martin.  Maybe I though of myself as superhuman, one who can control all feelings, expeiences, and obstacles that I may come face to face with.  Maybe I thought, that even though I am presented with these obstacles, I can block these feelings with a superficial smile, and justifications as to why I can not subject myself to how I feel.  Yet,I did feel and still do-- I feel angry, guilty, unworthy, violated, used, urning, frustrated, superficial, hypocritical, foolish, and loving.  The question that may be running through your head right now is why do you feel this way T.Martin.  Well to be quite honest, I havent really found any answers until today. About two weeks ago I did something that I rarely ever do, I lost control of my emotions.  A boy, who is commonly referred to as 'the boy', pursued me and led me to believe that I was more than just any regular girl.  He called, he asked my friends about me, he hung out with me once or twice--he made me feel wanted.  Initially, I had no feelings for him whatsoever, but once that I realized he noticed me my perspective began to change.  As you can see from the start of the story my feelings began to change for the wrong reasons.  One Saturday night, I met up with him, and the way I had planned out that evening didn't work out how I wanted it to at all.  The following Sunday I was a wreck, and I'm sure he doesn't even realize that I was and I know for a fact that he could never realize why. Although the next day I tried to talk to him about it, I knew that there was no way of easily bringing up Saturday night; so I jumped right into it.  The funny thing is, that after reading the conversation again, I realized I never really said what I wanted to say.  Since I didn't want to scare him off, I only said things that I thought he might have wanted to hear.  I could feel that there was no connection, and that I led myself in the wrong direction.  Days passed, and I continued to be frustrated.  The problem pretty much consumed my entire being, because I knew that there needed to be one way or another to let out how I felt.  I hoped that he would attempt to talk to me and try to resolve the situation, but for some weird reason I knew that it wouldn't happen, because we had trouble saying hi to each other.  When I reached the point when I realized that this situation was hopeless, I found out that he had his ex-girlfriend spend the weekend.  I've never felt so low in my life.  It took a four hour conversation with a really good friend to realize, that as much as I wanted to make him feel a certain way, it wasn't possible, because he never entered the situation with the feelings I had.  That conversation held me through this entire day, it cleared my head;it made everything in the world that seemed wrong to seem right. The only flaw was that I still wanted closure.  Tonight I attempted to try to make closure, I went to im him online as a friend, and talk to him as if we're just friends, because I realized that if someone can cause all of these terrible feelings that I had, then I know that what we did was not right for me; but I still wanted friendship.  So I noticed on my friends computer (also his friend), that he was online. So I went back to my room in order to pursue a conversation, but I noticed he didnt come up on my buddy list.  I had my roomate check to see if he was really online, because maybe I was wrong. Oh no, oh no, he was online--but he was blocking me.  Could this kid be anymore of a jerk, I think not.  Now as much as you think that I would be worried and upset, that is not the feeling I have AT ALL.  I am so glad that that happened, because it not only puts into perspective how immature he is, but it really deters me from even wanting to be friendly with him.  It's not like I attempted to im him on a normal basis, I've never even called him, and there is no way in hell that I would go out of my way to see him.  So the fact that he has to block me, because he cant handle telling me to my face that he just wants to be friends, and that he still has feelings for his girlfriend, honestly leads me to believe, that he is probably one of the most disrespectful guys I have ever met.  What it really comes down to is that my live journal is probably going to be one of the most intense web pages out there because everything I say in here, I struggle to say outloud.  I don't know why, I can't fathom what prevents me from doing so, but I feel like when I write it, its more honest and legit.  So the goal I am setting for myself is to completely cancel him out of my life.  If anyone can make me feel this way, can not decifer between his feelings for his girlfriend and for a girl he is pursuing, can not be honest with me about what his intentions really are, can put me in a decision where I felt forced to do things I didn't want to, can not respect my morals as a person, and can not even have enough balls to talk to me after the fact--is a guy that I do not want in my life.  Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson--not only do I need to trust my gut instinct and wait out my relationships as little bit longer, but I can finally say screw you.  I'd rather be alone for the right reasons then with someone for the wrong.  (p.s.- Prophet D, I think this entry is another one of those irrational decisions that I decide to make in the moment)"

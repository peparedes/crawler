The Matches are as follows:


In a rematch from last week, Crow takes on George Martell w/ The Freak Foundation. Last week Crow was defeated in a match to decide if he would join the Freak Foundation and then humiliated in the post match beatdown. Will Crow rise to the occasion and upend Martell and win his acceptance into the Freak Foundation?

""Mr Entertainment"" Freako vs Ray Beez w/ Gene Beard. 

Toxic vs Sean Zindell 

Legion"" Freaking"" Cage w/Gina Marie vs (Me So Good) Nooie Lee
This is definitely one of the matches on the card that will be Match of the Night. These 2 men went tooth to nail last week in trying to score the win on each other. What do these 2 men have in store for each other this week? Come to IWE's Collision Course to find out!!!!

""Raging Bull"" Eddie Taurus vs ""The Assassin"" 
One of the most underrated workers in all of Florida takes on a newcomer to the business. Eddie Taurus is known for a no nonsense- take it to them style of wrestling, as well as some hard hitting. It could be a short night for the Assassin once ""Raging Bull"" Eddie Taurus gets through with him.

Ice vs ""The Ace"" Vinny Lee w/ ""Merc"" Tony Gunnz- Last week we saw ""The Ace"" take the easy road to the win by cutting a check to ""Merc""Tony Gunnz. What is in store this week for either man. Could ""Merc"" Tony Gunnz be the X factor?

""Latin Sensation"" Ricky Romeo vs Jerome Hendrix
Great friends colllide as we anticipate a very good matchup between these 2 competitors. These 2 have a long history of being friends. Could this end at the conclusion of this week's 
show?

And in the Main Event, we have Michael Patrick/Suicide taking on Sideshow/Druid w/The Freak Foundation.
This is a rematch from last weeks show as the Freak Foundation eliminated Michael Patrick from the match to pick up the win on the young Suicide after a Black Hole Slam from Torcher. What does Sideshow and Druid have planned for the opposition? Will Michael Patrick and Suicide overcome the odds stacked against them?

"event","Ya know, this past weekend we lost one of the best wrestlers, as well as entertainers out there. ""Latino Heat"" Eddie Guerrero, is gone and I just don't know what to say. Someone I grew up watching all these years, from back in the ECW to WCW to WWE days, is not gonna be around to see get another World Title around his waist. Unbelievable...

I met him twice, and both times he was a very kind and very nice man. Never really got to work with him in practice at Keirns or anything , but talking to him was special. I know that I am gonna miss him, as well as every wrestling fan, casual or hardcore fan, will miss as well. 

I remember watching Eddie vs Malenko and just amazed at how fluid they were in the ring together and just in awe of what they were doing. Same goes for his matches in Japan and against Benoit, Mysterio, Jericho, and countless others. He made everyone look good no matter there ability. I remember when he was out of WWE and was busting his hump to get back to the ""BIG SHOW"". Seeing him take on Super Crazy at a ROH show was fucking amazing, the man looked like he never missed a beat. His recovery from the abuse, and his eventual Heavyweight Title win, and then him celebrate with Benoit, goes to show ya that good guys do win... 

The wrestling world will never be the same, this will affect us all for years to come in some way, shape or form. Just wish it was a dream and I could wake up from it. Too young to go so soon, saw that he passed of Heart Failure, which is a shame.  I would once again say thank you for being the best out there every time you came through the curtain , and for entertaining me like only you could.  You are in a better place, as much as I hate to say it, I wish you were still here.  My heart is broken, and my prayers go out to you and your family.


God Bless,


R.I.P  Eddie Guerrero




Thanks go the WWE for the moving tribute on Raw, I cried like I haven't cried in a long time. I feel like I lost a brother in this sport of ours.."

"event","So as I was layin down watching some of the good ole TV, I came across this episode of Dateline NBC. Now normally I don't watch stuff like this but the title caught my eye and I had to watch and see what happened. They were doing an undercover report on online child predators. Basically Dateline and PervertedJustice.com were working together and posing as underage boys and girls and were contacted by many people in the attempts to have sex with them! Absolutely fucking disgusting to me, but these sick bastards acted like nothing was wrong!  They were told to go to a house and the person playing the kid, said that they spilled a drink on themselves and had to change, and for the perp to just hang out in the kitchen. These guys, which range from various walks of life, then were shocked to see an adult in the house!(Go figure)  Needless to say I laughed my ass off at these sorry excuse for people and of course the excuse, ""I have never done this before"" was used(Thats like saying I've never gone in the back door on a chick! Of course with the chick willing!  Come on now!) There was a 50 year old emergency room doctor, some military guys, even a Rabbi!!! One guy who got busted even went to meet the same kid the next day at Mcdonalds!! Some people amaze me!!   Sick bastards!!


If you want to see the other sick bastards, you can go to PervertedJustice.com and see everything. Amazing what people do, my god!!"

"event","Hey folks, know I haven't written much lately, but I need to please ask a favor of everyone. Ya see I have a friend, Jerome Hendrix, who we all know and love, and his grandma is not doing sooo well.  I lost my grandma at a early age so, I didn't get a chance to really get to know her that well, but Hendrix does. So could you please say a prayer for his grandma, and just think well wishes for her so she pulls through what's ailing her? He is a very close friend , and hate to see him go through this on his own.. So say a prayer, a kind thought, or just wish her well, I am sure it would make quite a difference.. Thanks for your time....

"event","Ok so I said I would update about some of the shit thats been going on so here we go.. Keep your tray tables up and seatbelts locked at all times!!!!

So Oct 4th I left for Portland, Maine. My ex girlfriend who I went out with and stayed in contact with for over 5 yrs lives there and we have been talking more seriously lately about our futures together. I decided I was gonna visit and see how things would go and go from there...

I left Tampa about 6:30, flew into Washington Dulles Airport, which if you haven't flown into it, it's an absolute clusterfuck...Get off plane and check to see what gate I am on, and the FUCKING FLIGHT IS CANCELLED!!!!(due to weather, fog!!). I am fucking going nuts, go to the customer service desk and they inform me that there are no more flights that night, or the next , and I would be in Washington till Thur!

That shit wasn't gonna work as I HAD to be in Portland so Laura could pick me up. So they said I could catch a flight to Manchester, NH  which is about 3 hrs from Laura. So I call her, she says she will be there(awesome woman I tell ya!) and I proceed to the gate. I arrive at the gate with time to spare and wait.. and wait.. plane was supposed to leave at 9:20, I was at the gate at 9:10 and they were boarding for Philadelphia! I asked the Missy Elliott double if the flight for New Hampshire had boarded. She stated it left 25 minutes ago!!!! HOLY FUCK I AM PISSED!!!!!!

I proceed to haul ass back to the the cust service desk and notice that 2 security guards weighing about 150 lbs are following me.. I get to the desk and the lady has the nerve to ask what is wrong! I tell her ever so nicely, ""YOU BOOKED ME ON A FUCKING PLANE THAT LEFT BEFORE I GOT TO THE GATE! AM I SUPPOSED TO CHASE IT DOWN THE RUNWAY?"" The lady looks at me like I am crazy and the security guards ask if there is a problem, and I respond back with""If I don't get a flight out of this shithole and get as close to Portland Maine, tonite, then we will have a problem."" Security guard looks at me crazy and I respond back"" And it's gonna take more than you 2 guys to do anything about it either, so you better get a bigger guy or more of ya!"" I WAS FUCKING PISSED AND don't have the greatest temper.( I ain't as big as Bruce Steele,Erick Stevens or Madison,  but I sure as hell ain't no Suicide or Heater, and have a decent size  can hold my own!)She then tells me the only other thing is flying into Boston... Never been there, I call Laura and she says that she will Mapquest directions and she will be there but will take 4-5 hrs to get there.. I was like, ok just be careful driving.

I make it to the gate and board the flight finally, but pissed cuz of all the bullshit I have gone through this evening... Finally get to Boston, and I hate it. No Mets Fan should be subject to being in Boston for any amount of time... So I get in about 11:00 and sit and wait.... and wait.. and wait.. and then Laura gets to the airport at 1:00 am... and finally see her, and it is sooooo good.. I can't explain..  We hug, smooch , all that lovey dovey happy couple stuff and haul ass... 

Needless to say it was like 1 when we left, and with the fog, and the fact that my girl needs glasses to drive at night, and trying to remember the way back, we finally made it home at about 6 am. And yes, I did not fall asleep once in the car on the way back.. Anyone that has gone on road trips with me knows I tend to fall asleep on the way back.. But was wide awake... After all I hadn't seen my beautiful girl in forever...  So get to bed at 6 am and she has to get up 40 minutes later.. Poor girl.... but we were together again , and will be together again very soon..

Oh yeah, and to add insult to injury, my luggage got more flying miles than I did, then sent it to Boston, then to Portland, then back to Boston, then to Portland again, then once again to Boston before they realized that it was supposed to be in Portland in the first place!!! What a bunch of dumb motherfuckers!!!! Finally got my luggage Fri afternoon at like 4...."

"event","Hello folks, yes I know, I haven't updated much lately... Just been really busy, working, tanning, wrestling here and there( I will get to that story later on), and just resting and went out of town for a couple of days... I will cover that story as well cuz it's a real good one..... 

I want to congratulate Antonio Banks, who is now signed a developmental deal with the WWE... I had a feeling they were gonna sign him up back when he worked Mideon at the Raw at the Ice Palace... Never seen any non-WWE guy get as much promo time as he did, ok maybe one other time but that was Scoot on Sunday Night Heat talking trash to Michael Shane..but still congrats nonetheless...

Went to my first Lightning game ever! Yeah I know, been living in the state since I was 14 and never been to a game since they started.. Definitely nice seats and good view of the ice from section 321, matter of fact I think it was the same place where I sat for Raw...

I also want to send a big Happy Birthday to my boy, Jerome Hendrix! One of the nicest and most caring guys around in this business, I am proud to call him a friend and a brother... Luv ya man, and hope you have a good one...

This is going to be short and sweet as I will come back and write some more later, but if you haven't seen the movie Waiting(about the fictitious Bennigans rip off), then you better get your ass there right away!! That movie has my vote as one of the funniest motherfucking movies this year, right behind Wedding Crashers and 40 year old virgin.... Great flick...


Well thats about it, waiting for someone I Love(yes I used that word) very much about(Hendrix knows who it is) to get off work so we can go into town and have a good time dancing, and enjoying each others company... Yeah I'm not in Tampa... Im in Maine bitches!!!!  I will update some other time with the story, but damnit I don't want to come back.. but I have to... Life Sucks, but it's not so bad when you know someone loves you..   Peace Out bitches!!!"

"event","Hello folks..  I am back with another edition of my latest news and tidbits.. So let's get to the action!!!

-Went to Raw with some guys from work. Got a free ticket and saw a bunch of local guys there, Pretty Fly, VinnDetta, Hendrix, Havoc, Mark Zout, plus there were others that I heard of but didn't see

- Some of the local guys got shots on Tv...Michael Patrick(otherwise known as DR) got a match with Renee Dupree.. Good little contest with DR catching the finisher to theback.. Madison and Buck worked Big Show and that was pretty good too. Antonio Bank$ took on Mideon early and cut a nice promo bashing Tampa.. Good job by all the guys, but I was also looking forward to seeing Bruce and The Crashers... I thought that this Raw sucked ass, the only highlights were Flair coming to the save of HBK, Lita's tits, Hardy vs Edge, and that was it.. We left during the Angle/Cena promo...



-Totally devastated by this New Orleans thing... Its like hell on earth from what I have read in the paper and seen on the TV.. Fucking government taking their sweet ass time to do something about it..

-I have to agree that taking some time off from wrestling whether injury related or just to give your self some time to heal up, is a good thing.. I am more excited to wrestle than I have been in a long time... and working out with guys like Madison, Buck, Stevens, Hendrix , and others helps out too.. Things are looking good ..

- Got some good comments about the new gear.. I fucking love it.. Jolene did such a good job on it, I just don't know what to say... 3 more pairs are in the works...

-Trying to find a good screen printer to get some shirts made....Any ideas or places to go, please let me know..

-If anyone has a 8MM camera with a cable to plug into your TV to watch it right on the tv, could you lend it for a day or two.. Got something I need to do, and would need it.. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

-Did the ACW show at Bourbon Street on Sept 3rd... Bout 8 matches, all were pretty solid, a couple stood out more than others , but all were solid... Got to meet Xavier and Devito... Nice guys, real easy to talk to...

- I was in a 5 man cruiserweight invitational... Yes regardless of reports, I am a cruiserweight legit... I am only 215.... Match was planned out well, we kept it simple, everyone made it through safely, even Suicide who took an ass beating from me, and even a top rope spinebuster, but came out fine.. Good kid too, bumps his ass off and just a genuine babyface... Crowd liked him.. Match ended when I hit Suicide with the Top Rope Spinebuster, and didnt cover him, I was celebrating the move and Legion ""Freaking "" Cage hit me with a tornado DDT... and pinned me.. I underestimated Mr. Cage....  But got my revenge when I caught him with a spinebuster after the match.. Should be a great feud with him..   I really pissed the crowd off before the match with a verbal and racy tirade about the crowd being all related and shit.. Pretty funny...

- The ACW DVDs are looking really nice.. The office is doing a good job on them.. Seen the first 2 and the video quality and on screen graphics are nice... Envy vs Heretic was a good match too, poor Heretic busted his forehead open on the finish and had to go to the hospital..

- Big congrats to Madison and Buck who will be going to Japan this weekend!!! I know you read this Madison so update your journal, lol...

-Been reading William Regals book, which Erick Stevens let me borrow.. (Thanks bro!) Great read, lots of info about the business to pick up on, goes real in depth with his demons and stuff... Almost done with it.. Definitely a must read....

-Looking for some best of Tapes, if anyone knwos where I can find some.. of Ricky Steamboat, Regal, Orndorff, Rick Rude, ....Lets say I am doing some homework... Want to be good at both heel and face..  I have been working on some things , but it takes time... 

-Speedy Recovery goes out to James Morrison who is out for like 7-9 months due to very bad knee injury... He will be missed.. Speaking of knees, waiting to get an MRI on the right one.. been bugging the shit out of me since the doubleshot at Sunray....keeps slipping and popping.. Not good..

- IPW show is coming up.. Should be just pure fucking insanity!!! I always enjoyed their show at the Plex.. Very innovative shit they did and seen some great matches there.. (Daniels vs Scoot in a cage, amongst many others..)

Well thats all folks.. Sorry if it was a little long.. Needed to make sure I covered the bases...."

"event","Ok so I was bored and decided to update.. Been told I don't update much..

Ride to Melbourne was fun... Rode with Mercury, Hendrix, and Mercury's girl.. Real nice woman... They look good together, so good for him...

Was able to get Vinndetta on this show as someone cancelled due to Hurricane Katrina...Glad to see him and his dad at the show.. Love those guys...

Good catching up with people I aint seen in forever.. Chasyn, Snow, Baddboy, Malibu, Mr High Light,Zilla. The venue was really nice, the lady working the concessions was fucking hawt!!!!!

Show had a good crowd there for a Sun.. Was skeptical how they would draw on a Sunday but they did very well.. Looks like the owner wants to corner the market on Sundays so we will see how it goes...

The card was switched around alittle.  Vinndetta finally got the chance to work me, as we both have been wanting to work each other for awhile now.. It was a pretty good little match, with the whole ""So Sexxxay"" gimmick going, the crowd was into it... Vinny went to the well one too many times and caught the spinebuster for his troubles.. I really enjoyed working him.. 

The rest of the show was pretty good too, the booker was happy with all the matches.. Super Destroyer 8 was hilarious, coming out with BBQ sauce to eat Hendrix...They had a good little comedic match with Ocho somehow eaking out a win... 

Sedrick and Chasyn was pretty good too, Chasyn getting his nose busted was not good, as Sedrick must have thought he was Varsity Kid or something..lol

Bruce and Erick was very entertaining shit I must say. The whole purse spot was classic, Erick being scared of the life size Hulkster doll was good shit...

Beef O bradys was a very good sponsor.. Took care of the boys by hooking them up. I think I let Bruce Steele down by taking on Kentucky Jordan and letting him score first in Madden 06..Sorry Bruce!!

Congrats to all the guys who made the PWI 500 list..

Got the best of Triumph : The insult comedy dog, and must say the shit he says is off the charts... Had my stomach hurting I was laughing so hard...

There will be more, probably tomorrow..

"event","Ok, so as I am sitting here , I thought I would take some time out to update about last nightand other things.......

Went to the EWE show last night in Temple Terrace.. Very nice venue to have a show in. Their staff( I think it was one guy) was very nice....

Crowd took a little bit to get into it, but they got into it though... Good crowd for their first time around. Once word gets around in that area that there is wrestling on a regular basis, it is gonna get craaaazy!!!!

Great news, as I got my official gear from Jolene... She definitely surpassed my expectations for what it would look like.. Looks like something you would see on Mon or Thur nights being worn... Absolutely Outstanding...  Still getting 3 more shorts in the next couple of weeks...

I really liked the show itself...not a weak match on the card itself... Got to finally after all this time meet Jenn. I am pretty sure she is Madion's girl, and she was very nice to talk to... Also got to sit with Mary Kate, and her cousins, who said are dorks.. or maybe she said one of them was a dork.. Can't remember...

Fan in the Corner did the sound.. At first we were having problems with the microphones but got that straightened out... Somehow got the keys locked in the minivan... OOOPS.. Thanks Alan.. LMAO... Luckily his daughter brought a spare..

I honestly have to say that the match of the night, and there were a couple of them, would have to go to Heartbreak Express vs Jacob/Jeremiah w/Uncle Grady.....Just pure comedy, had me laughing start to finish..Love HBX's gimmick, always have... But just great spots and lots of comedy... Great match....

Hendrix vs Kahagas was good, Saint vs Scott Davis(who i think looks like Chris Candido RIP) was really good, with Hendrix putting the pimp slap to Davis for an earlier interference... Crowd was really into Hendrix..

Scott Commodity vs Preston James was good too, good crowd interaction there, weird seeing current partners collide, but a good showing nonetheless...

Antonio Banks vs Brian Gamble was good. Haven't seen Brian in a while, and looked a step off, but still did good.Antonio showed why he should be in Stamford instead of the ""305"", but then again there were a couple of guys on this show who should be there also...

Buck had noone to wrestle since Kanyon wasn't there, so he challenged Commish""Marvelous"" Mike Sullivan.. Good match between 2 guys who have been many places in the biz..Buck the outrageous heel that he is did his thing, Sully fired up and had him on the run, and Q2 interefered hitting Buck with the chain, which led to Sully rolling him up for the win, but the Crashers interfered.....

Leading to Stevens/Madison vs Market Crashers.. Very good match, lots of brawling in and out the ring, lots of wrestling, very physical encounter, which led to referee Dwayne Wayne being bumped and calling for the DQ... 

Good times were had, got to hang with Tshirt Mike, his brother, and Richard T....Looking forward to the next EWE shows...

Today is Sunray in Melbourne, should be a very entertaining show, usually is, looking forward to seeing Erick Stevens take on Bruce since I coudlnt see it Fri night in Sanford...I am taking on David Mercury tonite, which could be a show stealer, we will try to at least.. and also see Hendrix take on the madman, Super Destroyer 8... Plus the late addition of my buddy Vinndetta taking on ""The Killing Machine"" Snow... Gonna be a fun time and afterparty will be fun too... 

Have a great day folks!"

Went and saw the 40 yr old virgin... Fuckign hilarious.. Took my dad and we laughed our asses off... I coudn't believe Kimberly Page was in that movie.... She has got some nice store bought boobies... And a nice nipple slip if I must say so..... Definitely highly recommended...

Work has been good, Gym has been good as well, wrestling is looking good as well , new gear will be in this weekend just in time for the Sunray show, and I hope(fingers crossed) the EWE show, regardless, I will be there to check it out..

Sunray looks like a good show, they alwys have a good live crowd and this should be no different... I take on David Mercury in what should be a great opener, and then I get to watch Super Destroyer 8 or ""Ocho"" tangle with Jerome Hendrix.. That should be entertaining as all hell, as ""Ocho"" makes me laugh my balls off..

Getting back in the groove again with wrestling practice.. I think the hardest part is time management as far as working out, and training..But I think I have it under control.. Be easier when my current gym membership runs out, then I can lift at the school, then wrestle right after.. Be real simple that way...

Tonite was fun at the school, Learned alot tonite from Buck, he really helped me with some stuff, but just listening to explain things was really good too... Got to mix it up with a couple of people, mostly Hendrix, and Buck liked what he saw.. We took it to each other and we both left with busted lips... Thats what happens though, shit happens....Definitely one of my fave people to work with is Hendrix.. and many others.. Sonic Youth, Madison, Dwayne(student), Tom Cruise(student/wrestler) were there as well. Was hoping to work with Sonic some , as I know we will be tangling here soon in the near future. 

Raw is coming on Mon, I am sad, cuz I found out the guy I was gonna get tickets from didn't get enough, so if Lenny your reading this, could ya email me? I got a question for someone 100% muy guapo such as yourself.....

So I was thinking that since I am making a return, that I would call it a catchy title for the return,  Like the ""So Sexxxay"" Tour 06, since 05 is almost over,  I think it woudl work, I am doign the same gimmick, just making some adjustments thats all, I think all will like it.. But if anyone has suggestions, feel free to let me know.. 

Thats all for now, and HAVE A GOOD DAY!!!!!"

"event","Sat night, I went and checked out Ken Wards promotion, FPWA.. New Venue that I like a lot better than State Theatre... Ken is always good to me, and someone I would work for , and will work for in the future, any day....

Show started roughly on time, which is unusual these days.. Saw guys, and gals I hadn't seen in oh say........ a day or so.. some longer...

Heard alot about Evan Starsmore before the show, and he was facing one of my fave people, Aaron Epic.. Epic and I go waaaayyyy back to NSW days, and early FIP days when I used to work for them... They opened the show, very good match, the crowd basically sat on their balls the whole match... But I enjoyed.. I tried distracting Epic by flashing him my pectorals... He liked it... lol....

There were some good matches on the show, but then there were some really bad ones... one bad one for certain was Amir vs a very green Ben Hogan(from Auburndale). I like Ben Hogan, he is verrrry green, but has a good look and with a lot of work and adjusting his gimmick, he could be very good later on down the line, and he would have done good tonight, had he not been wrestling the German Shitbag, Amir..  He is just plain awful, I am not Ric Flair but damn.... Picture if you will, he is the heel, in a Boys and Girls Club, and he is cussing, and trying to get the crowd to chant"" Hitler Hitler"". Now if that dont get you kicked out of a venue, I don't know what will..

Psychedelics vs Navy Seal/Black Knight was very good.. I enjoyed it alot.. Sideshow/Stevens vs Punk & Disorderly was very good too....

Superstar Amy Love's gimmick is fucking phenomenal. Absolutely loved it..She was dominating, arrogant, just a fuckign uber heel.. The kid she worked, his name is Suicide, he was impressive too, as he bumped his ass off and hit some nice moves also, but the best was the F5 Bruce gave to him.. Goddamn he was up in the air for quite awhile... 

Rod Steele/ Frankie Capone  was very good too, Rod and his mic skills just kill me.. Sedrick and Dagon was really good too, he was still recovering from the ass whooping put on him by the Varsity Kid..lol.. Bruce and Zout was good, Bruce is also one funny as mother fucker.. He had me dying the whole time he was wrestling.. His spoof of Frankie was classic...

Good times were had by all, I had fun, plus I was surrounded by a bevy of lovely ladies, Mary Kate, Holly(Epic's girl) Jackie(Rods girl), and Bridget( Billy's Girl) so good company, as I tried to entertain them.. Plus David Shirt, Lenny, Aaron, Ron, Havoc, Liser, Ronnie Jr, were in attendance.. Fun Times..."

"event","Well I know I don't update often enough, so I am gonna update about fri night... and other stuff that has nothing to do with fri night......


- I am now the proud brother of not 1 but 2 sisters who are engaged.. Man how they grow up fast... Son of a bitch, at least they are good guys...

- Work is good, gym is good, been adding legs to the repertoire twice a week, they are responding slowly, so have no fear they will grow....

- Been hanging with the lady friend(s), things going well with that as well. Gotta have someone to keep me company and hang with! Good times being had by one and all!!!

-New Ricky Romeo gear will be ready this Sat, and I am looking forward to rocking it out at the Sunray show... Look out David Mercury, oh and I feel sorry for James Hendrix, I hear he is fond of dark meat, he might bring some BBQ sauce....

Fri nights EWE show was very good I thought.. God to see alot of good guys that I get along with and have alot of respect for,  Fan in the Corner provided exceptional sound, Lenny Leonard did his normal best as always, the fans were entertained.. Lots of great matches on there, thoroughly entertained by all. The Grady's and Varsity Kid had me in stitches, that shit was soo funny.... Don't ask Sedrick though, he wasn't laughing and I know why. It looked worse than i thought it was...

-First show in the new EWE home, it was humid, but it always is humid there, and the office did the best job they coudl to get it going, and I think it was a great job in doing so... Totally looked different than what I had know it to look like..

I fucking love D-Lo Brown from back in the day, and to see him there was fucking great...  the 3 way with him and Banks and Steele was one of the best matches, for comedy and actual wrestling... The 6 man was very good, the out of ring brawling was crazy but the crowd  was loving it,  The Saint vs Kahagus was very good as well, loved  the submission finish, never seen it before, but it looked real good.... Scott Davis turned on Jerome Hendrix which is good, hes a real good heel, and Jerome is a great baby. So I  am looking forward to that one in the future...

-There are other matches that I cannot remember off hand, since I dont have the list of the matches in front of me, but were all very well done..   Big congrats go out to Madison, Bruce, the Crashers, and Buck who are gonna be working the Raw/Smackdown Tapings.. 

- Got to wish Mary Kate a happy birthday, even though I saw her on Sat anyways..lol...

- Also got to see someone I hadn't seen it in a long time,  and that is Adam and Frankie Reyes.. Hadnt seen them in a long time, and it was good seeing them, we talked and there are some  things coming up that look pretty good, even might see Ricky Romeo in a EWE ring soon? Only time will tell..... Looking good though....

- I will be back to update about the Sat FPWA Show, as I am heading out to see Summerslam.. I am really digging the entire card, could be their best card of the year!!!!


Card Subject to Change....."

"event","Ok so I am gonna try and update this shit as often as I can remember, but since I think I am getting old timer's, I will do my best!!! Shall we play a game?????

-My lil sister is getting married.. Yeah I said it... April 22, 2006, she is taking the leap. I think its catchy... My high school buddy got married, one of my closest friends just proposed to his girl, damn what next..  don't look at me, I think you have to be in a relationship to think about getting married.... NEXT.....

-I miss reading Sedricks journal. For reasons that he has, he no longer is updating, but I still hate his pasty white gringo ass... Much love bitch!!!  lol

-Thanks to those that have been giving me insights as to designs for the new gear. Meeting with the designer tomorrow to come up with something.. Getting new pads and shit also.. .Knees are fucking killing me, so make sure I pad them up right...

-Saw the EWE show. I really enjoyed it. I got to see the guys, and I got to sit with MK, Amy Love, Bridget, and got to see the ever so lovely Ravyn. 

-I know people shit on the show cuz of the venue and the ring, but give me a fucking break, I have seen shows with better venues and better rings and have shitty matches.. I liked the venue, the ceiling was too low, but the fucking wrestling was fantastic.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion and I loved it... Erick vs Roderick was match of the night.  The 6 man match was very entertaining, and I liked seeing the work of Sal Rinauro, and Ray Gordy. Hadn't seen them before. 

-Tommy Vandal's baby is so damn cute. I sat in front of them making faces at the baby throughout the show....lol..

- Big shocker seeing Bill Alphonso there. Got to take him home, and we talked on the way home about the business adn stuff and he had some good advice that I listened too...

- If anyone has a idea for great entrance music, let me know what group and the name of the song, so I can check it out!

-  Aug 9th is ACW. I am taking on Shaun Hill. Looking forward to it.  I guess this is the start of a reemergence back on the scene. Gonna take my time with it and choose my spots.....

-I recommend watching Racing Stripes. I saw it and it was pretty damn funny.. Good stuff...

-Looking forward to checking out shows this weekend.. Should be good stuff... 

-Miss doing the Sunray shows, those were always fun and seeing that crazy fucker Super Destroyer #8, or Ocho as he is called is hilarious...

- Wrestling is starting to pick up so that is a great thing.. IPW Hardcore is making a one night appearance, I remember going there and watching the shows, and seeing guys like Erick before he started working at those shows...  My favorite memory is Havoc going through the entrance way.. Fucking crazy... and the Snow vs Phil Lation matches were great too...

"event","Well folks, I am back with a little bit of an update, not too much as everything has been the same shit... pretty much... so here it goes, in bullet points since that seems to catch attention.......

-Wrestling in Fl has me sad, I liked the days when there was a show at least once a week, whether it was during the week, or on the weekends, I miss those days...

- Watched Rise and Fall of ECW, and I must admit, I always liked ECW, but that DVD was just great... should of had more matches on it though..... Oh and my copy of ECW: One Night Stand is fucking awesome.. RVD and his shoot promo, as well as Heyman's was great shit...Currently viewing the Road Warriors DVD...

-Work is going well, about to hit the 1 yr mark already, didn't realize it went by so fast!!!

-Gym is going well, I put on 12 lbs of lean mass in 2 months... Thank you Creatine!!!! lol...

- Regardless what my retarded, but funnny friend Sedrick Strong says, I am not Mexican, and Hendrix is still White... 

- Finally ditched the fucking Mexi Mobile( my truck) and got a VW Jetta! Now I have even more reason to want to work, and that is to pay that bitch off as quick as possible...

-Been watching lots of movies lately... Batman Begins, Fantastic 4, both great movies, looking forward to Wedding Crashers...

- Want to wish the best of luck to the 2 new promotions, EWE and PWW, their first shows are coming up soon, I will definitely have to check those out and catch up with people...

-Wrestled for ACW on Tues night. Originally was gonna face Vinndetta in a Kendo Stick Match but it got scrapped. Instead I took on Shaun Hill and Cousin Dale in a 3 way. Now I am not a fan of 3 ways, cuz they can turn into a cluster, but it went very well , and I had alot of fun! The crowd was large, like in the 200 range is about right, and were very vocal.. Shaun Hill hit me with my own spinebuster, never taken one but definitely have given many to others, and I ended up losing to the Fujiwara Armbar. But something was set for next month with Shaun, so I will get my revenge....

- I will admit, Ive been having my doubts about wrestling, but, I enjoy doing it and am starting to look for new gear as I hate wearing those damn LadyKiller Tights....so look for a new design....

- Heard Rumors that Steve Keirns School has moved to a new location, if someone can give me the iggy I would appreciate it....

- NCAA FOOTBALL 2006 is off the charts. Fucking great game!!!!

- If your in Tampa, go to Vallarta's on Anderson Road, their fajitas are the fucking best around!!!!

Thats all kids, thanks for reading and leave a message or comment.... Later!!"

"event","one night a guy & a girl were driving home from the movies. The boy sensed there was something wrong because of the painful silence they shared between them that night. The girl then asked the boy to pull over because she wanted to talk. She told him that her feelings had changed & that it was time they moved on. A silent tear slid down his cheek as he slowly reached into his pocket & passed her a folded note. At that moment, a drunk driver was speeding down that very same street. He swerved right into the drivers seat, killing the boy. Mieraculously, the girl survived. Remembering the note, she pulled it out & read it. ""Without your love, I would die.""

Big thanks to all on the www.mistersaintlaurent.com message board who posted birthday wishes.....Unfortunately I wasnt able to sign in and reply due to the change in the message boards...But thanks to Josh Rich, MikeWG, Pato, Will Rivera and all the others... How the conversation went from my birthday to talking about Poop happened, I have no idea, but its the thought that counted!!!!!

Did the ACW show in New Port Richey on Tues night.. Good to see some of the guys I dont normally see around the area at that show. I wrestled(to use the term loosely) Dale Williams.. I love the guy, but the match was blah... First Actual match in a long time and not good....Oh well, Ill get the groove back over time no worries...Did hit the Spinebuster on him, how in the world I got him up for it I have no idea... He's a big boy... but a great guy... Scary moment of the night, when Laduke Jakes blew a fireball in O.G.'s face and it seemed to be  in his face forever instead of blowing out right away.. But he was ok..... Ended up meeting a nice woman at the bar, very smart(go figure for New Port Richey) and the best part, a massage therapist... Yeah you do the thinking there....lol.....

Peterson Cup has moved the finals to Palm Bay so I will definitely be going to check that out....Good Job to Zilla and Ron for coming up with something on such short notice...

Saw Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, and I hadnt seen any of the other new ones cuz I didn't care to, but this motherfucker was awesome!!! Big thumbs up to George Lucas.. I missed the cameo he did in the movie but oh well.. And the full trailer for Fantastic Four and Batman Begins is awesome....Looking forward to those....

Well thats all for now, just a quick update... Catch ya later!!!"

So I get to rest for the next 2 days, until the dreaded day comes, May 20th... I use to enjoy that day when it came around but now, I dread it.. Nothing more to celebrate on your birthday after you turn 21... So  we will see what happens on Fri.. I hope its a good day and I get lots of stuff.. But I doubt it..lol.... Oh well not looking forward to aging another year, but I still look young so its all good...!!!!

I fucking knew Winky was gonna beat Trinidad... Now I hear Tito's dad is retiring and that Tito said he was gonna too if his dad did... Bring on Bernard Hopkins Bitches!!!! St Pete in the House!!!!

Tonight is ACW. Gonna check it out. Im supposed to work it..We will see...Should be a fun time nonetheless...

Fucking super stoked about the progress in the gym.. More and More weight gets stacked on and I knock it out... Now if I can get my legs to do the same as my upper body I would be straight... I really think its funny when your at the gym and you have these guys put this massive amount of weight on, and then they go to do it, and its really their buddy the spotter helping them halfway up and they count that as a rep... I'm no bodybuilder, but i like to keep in shape and I see shit like this and I laugh... Do they think they are really lifting the weight on their own? Or they do it and they have the fucking worst form at all... Ridiculous... 

Looking forward to the upcoming Peterson Cup. Last years was great, and this years should be fun too.. Lots of hilarity after the shows.... DavidShirt knows all about that...  Well until next time...."

"event","Ahh well I know I have taken my sweet time to come back and update this thing but sometimes I just don't know what to write about... But I will cover this past weekends excursion into the wrestling world.. Pretty interesting to say the least...


Fri I worked at the bank, then headed out and met a one Fan In The Corner to head out to FSPW in Ellenton. I know what your all thinking, I should have gone to Sanford, but I was booked for this, but we did miss a hell of an evening from what I heard. The show was ok, I'm not gonna lie. It went on kind of long, some people didnt really stick to their times, and some of the people, should really go back to wrestling school or find something else to do with their time... But I do like the guys I worked the shows with, so that was cool. I also got to see Vindetta's gf Tami, who I hadn't seen in a while, and Mrs. Zout( not officially , but thats what I call her). I was dressed as security with ski mask and all, and just stood around until I got get my hands on Baddboy. And I did.. I also got reinstated. So now I'm taking him on  for the cruiserweight title. And to all those naysayers out there, I am STILL A CRUISERWEIGHT!!! A big cruiserweight, but still like 212-215.... 

Ok so on to Sat. Decide to meet up with a Mr. Hendrix and a prick known as Sedrick Strong....had to do it..lol.. Head out to Sunray, which I enjoy working for, its soo much fun.. Got to see a bunch of guys I hadnt seen in a while, Commodity, Preston James, The Crashers, Josh Rich, The brothers Steele, as well as Kubi and all the Sunray fans.  Super Destroyer #8 took on the young upstart Rip Malibu. It was fun, crowd was behind Malibu which was quite odd as Ocho is usually the over one in previous matches.. But that was cool.. Not a very technical match as a Ocho match never is, but a fun one.. The promoter enjoyed it, Ocho had fun, Malibu had fun, and Ocho picked up the win out of nowhere!!!! Sheer Craziness. Oh and they had professional pics taken of Ocho so maybe we will see them around.... And someone made an ""Ocho"" shirt..lol..  
The 911 Inc was way over as well.. Crazy since they are normally heels, but heard they had a real good match with the Crashers, and they were sporting new gear which I liked very much.. Erick was sporting new stuff too that I hadn't seen yet... Got to also see MK and Amy Love as they are a few of my favorite people to see.... But the best was at the end when 911 Inc came in to save Tommy Vandal and Bruce was in his drawers... lmao.... great stuff... then everyone else came out in their underwear too.. Bruce yelling out"" Everyone get in your underwear"" was something you will never hear at a wrestling show normally, but in this situation made sense...lol.... Aaron Royal was dying laughing and Erick almost made his way out in his skivvies, but realized that noone was in the ring at the time so decided not too....

The ride home wasn't too bad, sitting in the cramped ass backseat while driving home.. But just when we thought we were gonna make good time and make it back to Tampa in a reasonable hour, tragedy struck.. Horrible accident, that I swear had us in traffic for at least 2-3 hrs... but the time was well spent with Hendrix talking about how he had to pee, and so did Sedrick, but neither wanted to pee in the bottle, and then Hendrix said he had performance anxiety ..lol.... Finally got through the traffic and passed the scene of the accident, and Hendrix said"" Hope everyone was ok"", and then we see the grim sight of a body with a yellow tarp over it.. Not a pretty sight and quite disturbing.. Last time I saw that was on the way to  Sunray show and it was riding with Snow and Leon Scott....

Well thats about all for so far.... Things are going good..... Work, lifting, thats about it.. Personal life is starting to look up... Currently in discussion with someone so we will see what comes out of that...I have my heart set on someone but she lives too far away so can't really do anythign about that... 

Well thanks for reading, and remember Life is subject to change!!!"

Looks like my mom called the ambulance in time because they were able to diagnose and take care of it before it got worse... Turns out it was a inflammation of his periocardial wall which put pressure on his ticker... Thats what I was told by the Doctor on Sun when we could finally see him...So thank you again to all of you that gave well wishes for him, It means alot to see everyone taking a moment to wish well to someone they hardly knew, but is close to me.. Thanks very much to all.. I cant say it enough.....

Diet is going well, taking like 3000 calories  a day, eating mostly chicken, steak, turkey breast filets, tuna, potatoes, pasta, and rice... oh and eggs and salad too... Been very strict on it so thats good... Gym is going really well, feel a lot stronger than before..Did legs for the first time last week and those fuckers were sore as hell... Damn...

Went to Keirns this week, and got all paid up so I can start back and get in wrestling shape....Hung out at the school Tues and Wed and there was a interesting discussion over what kind of music you play when your having sex with a girl that is the best to play..??  I heard Barry White, Teddy P, and a couple of others... It was a pretty funny conversation had I just sat back and listened.. Personally I like some slow jams when its time to get busy....and sometimes I just like to hear the sound of bodies slapping against each other.. Depends on my mood I guess..

Was seeing someone in Sarasota, but that has come to an end.. Fucking High Maintenance, political women are not for me... And thats what she was too.. .lol.. Part of it had to do with the fact that she would never come here.. she came here like once and that was it... oh well, shit happens then you move on to something else.... 

Well thats all for now, my brain is fried and I need to head to the gym in a few, so I will be back with an interview done with Josh Rich that I will post on here...  Take Care and Thanks again everyone.......

Things have been going well, been on vacation this week from work and man that shit was well deserved... no answering phones, dealing with stupid ass customers, but I do miss the few hotties that are at my job...

I must say what the fuck is up with people lately? Just when you think shit is over, another sick fuck wants to do the same thing to another innocent girl.. Some people, I swear.. Dont know what goes through their minds, and dont want to find out..... But I did go to www.fdle.com and enter in my zip code to see what kind of sick fucks there are around me and I was fucking shocked....Amazing....

Big props to Lenny, who started his new job and is loving it as compared to counting the hours at his old job.. and he should be fucking AodShirts mom any day now, giving AodShirt the brother he always wanted....lol.. <3

I know I am way late on this but Big Props to Bruce Steele on a fucking great match with Jerry""The King"" Lawler. He will be following the Shane Twins soon and then I can brag about getting F5ed out of my boots as he killed my former partner right after that with a sick clothesline. I definitely will be getting the DVD of the Ice Palace show...

Also want to send my condolensces out to O.G. Scarface, as he and his girlfriend of quite a while, Ana Mosity have broken up. Look out women of New Port Richey!!! O.G. is looking for some poontang!!!! ha ha ha

The gym has been good lately.. Been in there busting my ass with my gym partner Trevor.. Got on a new diet on Mon and the hardest part is trying to stick to it, and not deviate from it.. But I am doing the best I can by preparing my meals before hand so I know what I am eating.. Not bad so far.. Eating like every 2-3 hrs..  

Went to the ACW show last night in Bourbon Street. Good crowd, some rowdy fuckers, overall the show was eh, I honestly as well as with talking to other people only really saw like 2 good matches, and a decent hardcore match. The 2 really good ones were O.G. vs Legion ""Freaking"" Cage. Cage is from the NE area and is pretty good..Gangrel was at the show checking it out and he was telling me more about Cage.. Gangrel was having a good time as well, I hadnt seen him in forever and found out, he split with Luna.. Sorry to hear that as I told him since they had been together for quite a while... The next good match was O.G vs David""My brother from another mother"" Mercury. Real good match which ended with Ana Mosity costing O.G. the title and having Mercury score the title with a swerve not foreseen...  Also Mosca vs Dale Williams was fun to watch, highlight was Mosca taking the back body drop onto thumbtacks... and Laduke Jakes fireballing him in the face...

After that was fun, hitting up the Brass Flamingo with the boys and of course the man with the plan, Fan In The Corner... That son of a bitch is one funny motherfucker... Didn't know that New Port Richey Titty Bars  were full nude and full alcohol bars.... Nice... There were only like 2 decent girls that worked there...But the fun was beginning with Fan in the Corner and some of the lines he had.... ha ha.. he was killing me with them...  My favorite was as a girl was flashing her twat, he would say"" WOO HOO LOOK AT MY COOTER!!!"" Killing me I tell ya.....

Well that is all, I have to pack for my weekend with my girl Im seeing in Sarasota, so I wont be back till Sun night... Hope everyone is safe, gonna try and hit up the NWA FL/FIP doubleheader on Fri Night... Gotta finish my Myoplex shake and then hit up Green Iguana for my one night of drinking per week...... Late!!!!!

And Hendrix is White, and Jack Evans is black......to clarify!"

"event","Hello kids, and welcome back. I must say that I am rather shocked and saddened to see that the Great Pope John Paul II has passed.. Being that I am of the catholic faith(not practicing but I still believe) that hits close to home.  Also thank god the Terry Schiavo thing is over with and that she has ""passed"", I think its 15 yrs too late, she had passed when they said she was brain dead. And since you need your brain to operate properly, well with the exception of Sedrick, that would declare you dead.

This week has been pretty ok.. Work has been busy, been in the gym keeping busy, too bad my workout partner has not been  able to get in there as much as I like, so I go alone and do my thing.. Love that gym.. Probably one of the best gyms I have ever been to, and the women that go there are smoking!

Went out on a date , I guess you could call it, with someone Wed night.. Went to eat at Applebees, and talk.. Good times, nice girl, good sense of humor, then went back and watched Boat Trip at her place. That movie is not so bad and the dancing instructor was fine as hell! Good times were had there as well!!!! lol......
So I haul ass from there and meet up with my buddy to hit the Wed Night Spot, the Green Iguana. We hit up the Ybor one, then decide its fucking too crowded, and as the ""Axe Bomber"" can attest, when it is crowded it is hard to move, let alone pull off the Flaming MatchBook trick.. So we head to Causeway Green Iguana, which is the final Wed they are doing before they shut down and the whole area gets torn down and turned into condos... But definitely more room, and lots of more women...  Had a good time there, met this gorgeous blonde nurse there, and spent the whole night just chatting away with her.. Damn she was beautiful. Numbers were exchanged and  I made sure to get what was stuck in her throat out....LMAO... DAMN HOTNESS!!!!

Thur, I went and checked out ""Guess Who"". Funny movie, I have always been a fan of Bernie""that somumabitch""Mac. Kutcher was decent.. The daughter was very cute in that flick... Saw  a trailer for a new Wes Craven flick, and anyone that knows me, knows I am a Wes Craven mark!  

Talked to the nurse Thur night, decided to make an evening out of it and play some putt putt.. Too bad the place was full of fucking tourists, or else I would have destroyed her in Putt Putt.. We then went to AMC Woodlands, and saw Sideways... Good Movie, it took me a little bit to get into it, but definitely a good movie and some fucking funny ass parts.... The whole ""cock in the ass line"" was fucking classic! I am forever in love with Virginia Madsden, as she is smoking, and has some nice breasts....Very Lovely... Thomas Hayden Church is fucking hilarious...Paul Giamatti is a great actor, definitely a fan of his work...

Rented Fri Night Lights and was one of the best football movies I have ever seen.. Billy Bob Thornton does a great job, and the ending was fucking unbelieveable.. Also rented National Lampoons GoldDiggers, and it has its funny moments, but I really rented it to see Nikki Ziering... Damn she is Hot too!!! WOO HOO!!!!

Sedrick Strong calling me at 4 in the morning asking for gay sex is not cool... I should have believed Josh Rich when he told me Sedrick was like that.. lol... Gotta bust on ya Dave... Ya sorry fucker...

WrestleMania is tomorrow, should be pretty interesting, I will be checking it out at the local sports bar, whichever one has the better drink specials... We will see!!!

I have been becoming a fan of this JAPW World Wide Taping they show on the internet.. Good stuff... Saw a 4 way with Florida's own, Chasyn Rance vs El Generico vs Grim Reefer vs Jack Evans. Good Stuff, the clip of it only shows Chasyn taking a sick brainbuster from El Generico, and then the rest of the match so it didnt show the beginning of it.. Might have to buy that one... Also saw Evan take a brainbuster onto the top turnbuckle(sick!) and take a superplex too the hardwood floor.. Thats a tough motherfucker!!!!

Talked to ""Super Pimp"" Alan Wojcik last night.. Man is throwing mad game at all those bitches.. GO ALAN, ITS YOUR BIRTHDAY!!!! 

Finally paid off the fucking Migrant Mobile truck that I drive.. Thank god!!! No more car payments till I decide to get another one.. however long that will be....

Yeah so that is all for now, Im fucking bored as hell and hope everyone is doing well, the whole move the clocks forward an hour is gonna fuck my sleep patterns all up... DAMN!!! Thanks for readin and remember... Card Subject to Change!!!!"

"event","Aww man, what a weekend. Interesting to say that least.. so lets now waste any time shall we?

So on the other post, I stated that I had seen Hostage. Real good flick, but also interesting to see how they were able to get local indy worker, Vindetta to play such a pivotal role in that movie... I knew he wrestled but the kid acts too? Damn.. Oh wait, maybe it wasnt him but someone who looked alot like him.. Coincidence, I think so....

Saw the movie Fat Albert, and regardless of what anyone says, it was a very nice heartwarming movie.. Also very well put together.. I enjoyed it very much... I also saw the Pacifier, and I must say I am not that big of a Vin Diesel mark, but that movie was pretty fucking funny... 

Sat night was the Sunray Invitational.. Headed out there with Fan In the Corner, and David Mercury... Was reading a wrestling encyclopedia that Mercury brought with him... Of course I looked it over and without fail, fell asleep while riding ( I always fall asleep) only to have Mercury honk my nose to wake me up.. I fucking hate that..!!!!!

So we get there, say hi to everyone, find out what is going on.. Sunray drew very well... Fucking hot crowd, some good matches, and lots of entertainment.... I got to watch Super Destroyer 8 or Ocho as he is referred to tag with MSL vs Josh Rich/Kentucky(ref). Crowd was really into it, lots of comedy gaga spots(ala OCHO), first time in wrestling history that partners tagged in and out telepathically.... I believe MSL is one of the few people that is completely off his rocker that can interact with Ocho.... Match ended with MSL taking the frog splash as OCHO was distracted talkin to Lew Spectre.. Super Destroyer 8 was welcome back with open arms by the fans which was nice to see... 
Unfortunately there was an incident with a fan (one of Malibu's friends) where he was headbutted by Ocho, and ended up with a broken nose! Those who were there know the real story so all you armchair reporters  think what you want...  Any questions about said incident, ask me....

After wards headed to HOOTERS cuz noone told us that they were going to Dennys!!! Hung out there got some free wings, talked to the Girls, and then left and went home...

Got back at like 2 am, took Mercury home, then went home myself, went to sleep and got up at 5 to go to work... How I made it through the day I have no idea.. Thank god for Fat Burners, and they do work... Ive lost the gut I once had thank god!!!!

Sun night I went to Whiskey Park to meet up with Tshirt Mike and Ben.. Good seeing both of them as I havent seen them in a hot minute... Not that busy over there but there were some hotties.. Didnt stick around long as I was exhausted and my knee was killing me.. DAmn... Have to get t looked at and possibly have doc clean it out... Who knows.. have to wait on the MRI to get done.... 

Work is going well, we have a new system we are using and its kind of hard to look at and a pain in the ass but what am I supposed to do other than deal with it? 

Well thats about it, talk to you guys soon.. Leave a message...."

"event","So hello there folks, just thought I'd cover some shit before the weekend hits, cuz Im real busy this weekend and dont know when I will be able to update ..

Tues night, went the ACW show in Bourbon Street.. $.25 drafts and a drunk decent crowd and you got yourself a wrestling show...Not bad to be honest, could have been better, but hey its entertaining.... Saw some people I haven't seen in a while, jsut to name a few.. Damien Angel, Morpheus, Daddy Pimp, Taurus, Mosca, Dale Williams to name a few... Fan in the corner was in the house  like always representing.... I got a chance to do my best Billy Dalton impression as I got to ref some matches since the original ref was not sooo good...  Crowd was drunk and loud, if the guys worked them right.. which some did and some didnt... Really liked the Sideshow vs David Mercury match, as Mercury hammered his head home with the chair shots and Sideshow came back for more.. Also really liked Scott Davis vs Tbolt... 2 great matches on the show... Others were ok...Those 2 stood out....

Been real busy lately lifting , working, and getting out and about... Been talking things up with a couple of people, and hanging out with them.. Good times going around for everyone...Met some real nice people, whether  things work out or not, is to be determined....

One thing that really has been bugging me lately is this whole Schiavo case, I know several people have talked about it on here but for christ's sake, this lady is through! She is not gonna miraculously come back to normal and live life happily ever after. Her brain is not functioning anymore and you guys are just keeping alive a shell of a former woman... Let it end and let her rest, plain and simple!

Now as far as this guy who killed that defenseless 9 yr old girl.. God I would love to fucking have this guy drawn and quartered... Except instead of to horses, have him tied to some monster trucks!! Fucking son of a bitch ! They should have that little girls family have 30 minutes alone with the piece  of scum and let them whoop his monkey ass! Or have him tied up with ropes on his arms and his legs spread wide, and have like 100 people line up , and take turns kicking that fucking inbred, shit eating motherfucker right in his dick.... See how he feels after that, unfortunately nothing is gonna make him understand what her family is going through and my heart goes out to them.. What goes through people's heads when they think of this shit..?

Saw  a couple of movies recently. I watched Hostage, and I must say that I was kind of skeptical about Bruce Willis eve since Hudson Hawk, but he redeemed himself in my eyes with this one.. Fucking action packed and it had a swerve on a swerve.... Definitely a must see!!!   
Also checked out ""Be Cool"" and I must say that it was funny as hell.... The Rock was on point as a gay bodyguard and he has some skill for a wrestler.. He puts Hulk Hogan to shame but then again anyone puts him to shame in the  acting dept... 

Good to see Stone Cold doing WM21.. And Hogan inducted into the Hall of Fame, its only a matter of time.. Bet that steams Macho Man's Pickle!!!! 

Tomorrow is Sunray, looking forward to checking out that action. Looking forward to the Sunray Invitational as I am torn between David Mercury and James Hendrix to win it ...I mean it's no Peterson Cup, but its nice to have another tournament of that type in Fl...  I keep hearing rumors of a OCHO sighting... Who knows where that wild beast will turn up... Semi Main is Josh Rich vs Kevin Devine vs Johnny Schumacher. That should be an interesting matchup, although, Kevin Devine no showed the ACW show on Tues so not sure if he will be at Sunray....

I finally got some good news I have been waiting on for the past 2 weeks.. Those that are in the ""know"" know exactly what I am talking about... Lets just say that Im glad Im not getting fucked over after all!!!!  

Well kids, tried to make it short and sweet, so sue me..  Oh and before I go, let me give a big good luck to Rod and Bruce who are going up to Wildside for Hardcore Hell this weekend.. 2 guys that I have had the privilege of working and know for a fact what a good tag team they are.. Wish my former tag team could have been as good as them, but then again we can't have our cake and eat it too.....

Ok Im out, got a date, and getting shit ready for work tomorrow and have a meeting with someone about a horse.... Card Subject to Change!!!!!"

"event","Hello Sports fans, and here is another excerpt of the life and times of yours truly, so lets get down to the action!!!!


So I had Wed and Thur off, didnt really have any plans to do anything other than my traditional Wed night excursions to Green Iguana. So we did just that. Started at the one on Westshore with some people from work, pretty cool guys, then made our way to the overly populated with lovely females Green Iguana on Rocky Point. So we get there, I already had like 5 beers and a shot of Jager. I end up meeting up with this girl I know named Amber. Really nice girl, talked on the phone alot,get along well, so this was first time meeting in person. Very cute I must say! So we are hanging out, and she is digging me(thank god!) Don't know why she is cuz I am getting hammered.. Love $1 beer night!
So needless to say, we talk , get close, drink beer, and someone decides it time for some Jager(oh wait, that was my idea) damn I was drunk. Now this isnt an every day thing for me, I drink like once a week, but I make sure to do it right... So we do a round of shots, drink more beer, check out other chicks in the club cuz there were sooooo many... End of the night comes, I remember to get my debit card back from the bartender, thank god... and begin to make our way to the parking lot with Amber, her friend who was with my buddy Mike, and go looking for the car. 
Now this is where it gets blurry. I don't remember nothing..lol.. I do have flashbacks of walking to the car,  but the thing that I remember the most, is the violent volatile projections from my mouth.. DAmn... that was rough... Mike counted like 6 or 7 times where he had to stop and let me talk to the ground... Geez... Needless to say my liver is not speaking to me right now....

I did go see Wes Cravens new flick ""Cursed"" Real good movie, as I am a fan of his and also of werewolves and all those crazy things... He did manage to sneak Freddy Kreuger in the movie... You will have to see it to notice... I really enjoyed it, they had Rick Baker doing the special effects, he is awesome at werewolves... Good plot, Shannon Elizabeth bit the big one , but then again if I was a werewolf, I would definitely sink my teeth into her... oh and Christina Ricci's breasts were lovely...couldn't help but notice them...  

Kind of upset that I havent heard from Sandra. She is the one who made my original gear and looks like she has dissapeared..Which is sad, as I always enjoyed the outfits she made for myself and the big name guys....So now I have to go through someone else but Sean Davis gave me the name of a nice lady who will hook it up... Now I got to get boots and stuff also... Will be my first pair of boots... WOO Hoo...

Gym is going well, trying to get a little more meat on me, for wrestling... 

Ex gf still calling and texting.. And to think she has the nerve to ask me if I am still pissed at her.... Um hello, yeah! Why would someone who breaks your heart, not think that maybe your still pissed at her..? Oh well, I will continue to soothe my pain with the company of some lovely ladies.....Ive met some really cool ones, not gonna just put all my eggs in one basket, so Im just having a good time and seeing what happens.... 

I wish the best of luck to Steve Madison. He is not feeling well and for those that read his journal know, we are hoping for a quick recovery. Steve is honestly a really good guy, a fun drinker, great wrestler, and the only person who can pull off the matchbook trick!!! WORD!

Well thats about it, remember to post in Sedricks journal cuz he is trying to beat Josh Rich. But I do have to admit, Josh's stuff is funny as fuck sometimes.... 

Don't forget to check out Sunray Pro Wrestling on Mar 26th., The match Im looking forward to is Hendrix vs Mercury...Good stuff... I heard that the Super Destroyer 8 or OCHO as his fans call him might actually be there. I haven't seen that crazy son of a bitch in a hot minute!!!!

"event","Ok kids, you guys can calm down and pull your panties out your ass, I'm back with another update. I know how you all cling to my every word like it's the gospel( yeah right)! Its been a fun couple of days lately, working and shit.. So I also went to the NNW show with Fan in the Corner and David Mercury....

Single life is going ok.. Ive been meeting people who seem pretty cool, there are a couple of applicants who might have what it takes to convince me to have some faith in women again..  We will see how it goes...

Hung out with an old friend the other night.. Needless to say it was a long time since I had seen her and  she has done real well for herself and I was very proud of where she got to... Own house and all.. So we hung out, talked , spent some ""time"" together and enjoyed each others company... It's like riding a bike, you get on and it all comes back to ya!

Ya know, the more and more I go to shows, the more and more I ask myself why I took time off? And the more and more I get asked when Im coming back. The response from the fans and the boys is really touching... I honestly didn't think that I would be missed that much, I didnt think there were alot of guys that liked me, but luckily i was trained right and taught to respect the vets and always shake hands even if you don't know them...Unless I can't stand the person then I won't shake their hand, or react to them being there.. If ya want to be a hater, thats fine, I don't need ya so go fuck yourself... But to answer the question, my plan is to come back in May, better and a little more in shape than before... Of course new gear and stuff since it was stolen... But I definitely need to come back as I miss it.. ALOT!

I definitely have to sing the praises of this book I picked up at my gym. Its called the BodySculpting Bible for Men. I don't really believe in books like that but this one is fucking amazing.. It covers everything from A-Z..Nutrition, stretching, dieting, form, technique, rest, recovery, supplementation.. I'm looking forward to putting these into place in the next few weeks.. and Yes that means I will be working legs, lord knows I need it...Definitely looking forward to starting the ""supplementation"" that comes along with this book.... 

Been going up to Keirns lately and hanging out cuz Im not ready to start training till April. Its good to sit and watch and pick brains of the guys that go up there.. Watching guys like Buck, and Madison, and the Rage in the Cage Winner Erick Stevens, as well as my homeboy Hendrix who has improved by leaps and bounds... Definitely look forward to getting in there and mixing it up and working on a more technical aspect and more psychology into my matches... Im really excited...

So Fri comes, Fan, Mercury and myself head up to NNW.. We leave around 3 and get to the venue around 6! Fucking Mapquest sucks Gorilla nuts!!! Damn... So we get there, Fan and I hit up Captain D's(which is a generic Long John Silvers) and the food is pretty good.. We laugh cuz there is this lady sitting in the table next to us who is just babbling incoherently to herself while we sit there.. I had to control myself from not laughing out loud!!  We get back to the venue, see Mr Wojcik and shoot the shit, say hi to the boys, and hang out..
 
The show drew really fucking well for the first time in Sanford. They had a packed house and I would say at least 100 maybe more? Some some fans I hadnt seen in a while and was warmly welcomed by everyone, it was nice.. They had some real good matches on there.. I definitely enjoyed the Mercury vs Legion Cage match, the Streetfight with Deathrow Jethrow and the trainee, Kid Romeo(the other Romeo,lol....)vs Jerrelle, Rip Malibu vs Flatline was entertaining, the 3 way Cruiserweight was fucking awesome job by Naph, Dagon, and Vordell. Crowd popped for a lot of their stuff, hope Naph is okay, seemed to be favoring his knee after the match.  The Tables Ladders and Chairs with Sedrick and Erick was fucking amazing! I never get tired of these guys working each other, they are definitely the future of Fl wrestling, and will be able to carry it on their shoulders for years to come...Now to say there aren't others out there that can do it, but these are 2 of 3 that come to mind, the other being Hendrix.... Stevens and Strong beat each other pillar to post, and to see Erick go to the top and do a Fat Boy Senton(and I mean that in the nicest way cuz you are looking alot slimmer) onto Sedrick who was laying on a table only to have Sedrick move and see a table explode the way it did was unreal!  
If there were no ropes the table would have flown out the ring onto the fans.. Then with Erick bending the ladder by taking a back body drop onto it( I believe thats what it was, I can't remember) was crazy.. A fucking fantastic job by both men, my hat(I wasn't wearing one) is tipped to you 2 guys... Even though Mk was shaking like a leaf.. poor thing...

Overall a good first show in Sanford, I enjoyed myself and was brought into the ring by Kubiak, the new commissioner who asked me if I was coming back and I said yes, after all, I never got my rematch with that trickster extraordinaire , Naphtali!!! Well Im about to head out, hope everyone enjoyed the read, I will try and be more frequent, I know Will loves to read my exploits...lol.. Well hope everyone is well and good, leave me some comments, concerns, whatever..... Take Care Folks!

"event","So I was sittign on the computer and stumbled across a music video.. Now mind you I dont really watch music videos unless they are good ones(Green Day, Linkin Park and such other groups) but I was sitting in front of the screen and saw a video that made me penis unattach itself and watch the video front row live and center.. I informed Tshirt Mike of this and he was amazed of my penis' dexterity... That video belonged to a young lady named Kelly Clarkson..

"event","Ah so I just woke up since this and tomorrow are my days off from the lovely bank that I work at.... Thank God..... tired of hearing motherfuckers complain..... ha  ha

So the last few days have been pretty interesting.... Been talking to Erica on the phone and just having conversation, nothing more nothing less. We talked and decided to hang out last night... Oh by the way Ben sorry about not calling you back, I know you saw me on campus... Should have hollered louder next time..... Ok so back to the story.... So we go get something to eat, and we leave the restaurant, and she almost hits this guy on a bike leaving the restaurant.. He was wearing all black and it was dark, so I dont blame her for yelling at him, so then we leave and head to get a movie.... 

We hit up HollyWood Video and end up getting Ray. We head back to the campus and begin watching it... The movie is long as hell but damn that shit was good.... Jamie Foxx is the motherfucking man, dont care what you guys think! Awesome performance and they way he got his mannerisms and facials were unbelieveable... So I leave after the movie, and she walks me out. Now we get to the truck and say bye and then she says she has to be honest.. So Im like ok.... And she says that the age difference is too much.... And I was cool with it, guess that happens when you try and hang out with 15yr old....ha ha ha.. j/k/ she was 20.... the thing that got me was we were just hanging out, I wasnt thinking of actually starting a relationship or nothing, I just got out of one... Now if it were a strictly sexual relationship, you guys know I never turn that down, cuz this girl was very hot!!! So it ended at that and that was cool. I just wasnt thinking  that far ahead ya feel me? Nice girl, had a good time... 

Now on the ex.. its funny, I havent talked to her since we broke up last Thur and then Mon night she text me asking how things were going. So I told her... then she wanted to apologize and wanted to know how I felt about it.. And I proceeded to text her back telling her how it was fucked up and how I deserved a better reason than just a vague""I dont have the same feelings anymore"" excuse.... and that was that for Mon.... Now she is texting me more yesterday just talking and shit.... I guess shes trying to be friendly and I will be as friendly as I can be for someone who had their heart taken and given an F5 off the Empire State Building...  oh well we will see

Now I want to know is anyone looking to purchase  a digital 8mm camcorder? I have a nice one(camcorder that is) ha ha that I am looking to selll. Nothing wrong with it, but Im looking to upgrade.....Im looking for about 125-150 for it....comes with the bag and shit... Id post a pic of it, but Im not hip on the pic posting internet lingo jazz.....

So if you are interested please leave me a message or hit me up online at aol...rromeo74.... and just remember when life throws ya a curveball that happens because the ...................................Card is subject to change.......

"event","Alright kids, I would like to say hello to everyone who says that they missed my constant updates and such and I must admit I started slacking and not posting while everyone else sure as hell was.. So lets get all 3 of my readers caught up on the going ons in the Romeo camp.....Dont know if you would call it a camp, there is only one here.... So here we go , buckle up, put your tray in the upright position, and keep all appendages in the vehicle at all times.....


First off, the lovely relationship I had with my gf of almost 3 months was officially terminated as of Thur night... Much to my surprise and to the surprise of many  who met her and know me...Things were kind of weird lately, we just got back from S Carolina visiting the folks, and I passed those tests with flying colors...... Then I decided to ask her what her deal was Wed night and she admitted she had been mean and not acted the same towards me, and apologized.... I went home and told her I would talk to her later.... Didn't talk to her at all Thur till late that night when she called and we talked and she sounded funny so I asked if everything was ok, and she replied with no...Then told me that she didnt feel the same towards me anymore and that it wasnt working out and didnt want to hurt me..... Um too late ya fuck! Sorry Im venting but I gave everything I had to make it easier on her, and got fucked over.....I did more for her in 3 months than I did with someone I was with for almost 4 yrs.... So It was real upsetting..... Ok Im done wasting my breath on that, just needed to get that out there....

So Sat comes and I decide"" I think I will go see everyone tonight at Rage in the Cage"" I missed last years due to I was in Orlando wrestling Kid Romeo for NNW at a rodeo arena.. and Mideon and I ( I love Mideon, in a brotherly way) got there at the end... So I make my way to the show...Walk in(I paid of course since I havent had any affiliation with them for quite some time, and it was like their WrestleMania).  I'll tell ya what I have been deciding if I was gonna come back, and was hesitant as to what to do, but after the last 2 shows I have been to and watching the guys do their thing, I realize how much I have missed it... The time off has been nice but I need to get started..  I miss the camraderie, and the talks, the jokes, everything pretty much... Plus I miss the fans and the reactions we get out of them... So I am in the process of getting my shit together and coming back and getting back in the rotation.... Wish me luck......

Rage in the Cage this year was I have the say the absolute fucking best indy show I have ever seen or been on....From top to bottom each match was great, there wasnt a weak match on the card and all the boys busted their fucking asses and worked the hell out of the crowd.... The 6 way was unreal , the Retirement Match with Billy, Scoot, and Mike was just fucking impossible to put in words.. The promo cut afterwards and standing with all the boys from the back watching the whole match made me feel part of something again and it was a good feeling..  I must give it to Hendrix, who absolutely blew my mind with the performance he gave against Bruce Steele and have to give it to Bruce as well as it takes 2 to tango and he made Hendrix look like a million bucks , but he always makes everyone look like that.....

I want to thank everyone who busted their asses on the show for giving 1000% and for welcoming back the way they did... I hadnt seen a lot of those guys in months and they made it seem like it had only been a couple of days, and after the week I had I really needed that... Big props go out to Will, MikeWG, Kyle( Twinkle Twinkle..lol) DavidShirt, Jason, Boberick, Shynerick, Dr Mark,Loy, Sedrick, Des and her posse, Big Al Wojcik, Mercury, Tbolt, Bridget and Billy Dalton, and every one who made me feel so welcome at a low time.... Soon there will be some sexxiness coming at ya and it will be more than last time.... There will be some changes made as part of that but they will be for the betterment of the gimmick.... Hopefully will be doing mostly singles unless I find a worthy tag partner.... 

I do also want to add it was great seeing MaryKate as well , she is looking slim and trim, and also want to say to Erick Stevens, damn bro!!!  Erick Stevens has become a fucking force to recon with. I always knew he would be just was wondering when it would occur and it has happened.. Hes absolutely fucking deadly in that ring and I have been the recipient of several of those ass whooping but he was fucking killer last night.. Congrats go to him on winning Rage in the Cage as I couldnt find someone more than deserving to win that...Its the year of Erick Stevens and ya cant stop it.. Congrats again bro...

I was gonna go to the POW show and visit but I got home late last night and then get up at 5 to go to work, and then came home and said""Ill take a quick nap and then go,"" well I overslept like a bitch!

I also do have to say a special thank you to Hendrixs gf Lindsay.. She is a great girl and introduced me to a friend of hers last night who is very attractive and there seemed to be some chemistry there just from talking and joking during the show.  She seems really cool and I am looking forward to hanging and getting to know each other.... Of course I am single so I can pretty much do what I want when I want to do it, so dont worry Will, Im sure there will be some stories just for you and MikeWg....oh and MikeWG, I still remember that compliment you gave me last night about if you had your own promotion, and it meant a lot man, thanks......

Well thats all kids, I know it was long but I had to catch everyone up on shit, and  I will be at more shows and working on getting back in better shape and planning my return.. I wont tell anyone when I come back Im just gonna say May, but not an exact date.. See how everything goes....... Ya never know what may happen, as they say on the flyers of the shows and as is with life..........................................................................Card Subject to Change!!!!!!

Thanks again to everyone!!!!!"

I am still working on replying to those comments as I am a busy guy with work, lifting, girlfriend, and many other things to take care of this week... Its vacation week from work but Im going out of town Wed with Marianne so Ive been busy getting things all together and stuff..  So wait your turn Sedrick, for christs sake! I still like ya kid...ha ha..... Went to the FPWA show on Fri, and it was good to see everyone... I have missed most if not all the people I saw on Fri. Henddrix and Morrison won the tag straps, saw my trainer Black Knight come back(which was long overdue), saw Tshirt mike (who is feeling alot better). Showed my new tattoo off to whoever wanted to see... And of course got to hang out with Fan in the Corner... who is I think the best fan in Fl.. but thats my opinion.... and to top it off, I couldnt sit there and watch anymore so I asked to be a surprise entrant for the Fl State Title.. what a look of surprise on Dagon Briggs, Amy Love, and the man I love to beat the shit out of, Leon Scott. I went at it with Leon(I was in street clothes, I couldnt watch anymore) and gave him some forearms and punches then he kicked me in the nizuts.. then tossed me out.. I hadnt been in a ring since Nov but it was fun!!!! Might have to speed up a possible comeback sooner than expected..."

"event","Yeah so I havnet updated in a while but to be honest I havent felt like really writing shit in here..

Congrats to Sedrick on meeting someone who makes him feel things that people who really care about an other feel.... What that is, I have no clue as it has been along time since Ive felt anything like that..

Lets see, Women suck, women suck, and women suck... and I dont mean in that way, they just suck.. Not really high on my list right now... and Ill tell why..

Ive been hanging with my ""friend"" Jennifer. We havent slept together or anything like that but we have done typical people who see each other ocasionally do(make out, shit like that). Well I was supposed to go to a wedding with her on Sat night and enjoy our time together. Well I was looking forward to this as she is really cool and a great personality. 
So I get out of the gym and I get a phone call from her saying that she doesnt think me going to the wedding with her is gonna work, and that she doesnt think that we are gonna work out.  Now we really didnt have a label but I did enjoy her company and the time we spent together.. So that is why women suck, cuz this was from out of nowhere and unexpected. Am I angry, no. Upset, a little. To be honest, I just have this dont give a fuck attitude and dont really care.. Just wanted to vent and get it off my chest.. Thanks livejournal.

Did the NwaFl show on Thur in Ybor. Got there and set up with Luther, Estizzle and Luther. A certain someone(KD) was supposed to be there and he got there like 7. Needless to say that was a crock of shit... I had to leave early to get some sleep since I work at 6am .. The match was Devine and Myself vs Erick and Luther(Ladykillers vs MVPS). We opened the show and  it was a decent match. I wasnt really feeling it, and I havent felt it in a long time to be honest with you wrestling wise, and I got the hot tag and came in cleared house only to be hit with the Menace 2 Society.. Very nice double team move... Thanks go out to Erick and Luther as I love working those guys.. Got some feedback from some people after the match and lets just say I wont elaborate but something has to be done...

Kudos to James Hendrix for working his ass off and also kudos to Michael Patrick for putting him over like he did.. Hendrix was over in Ybor.. He was ranked as one of the most underrated workers by 2 wrestling journalists....

Worked Naphtali for NNW. Before the match, I watched this kid Wild Bill work Kid Romeo. Now I have worked Kid Romeo and he is great, but this kid Wild Bill, holy shit he blows.. It looked like it turned into a semi shoot as Romeo was killing Wild Bill yet selling his ass off for the rookie...

Saw Teddy Har.... I mean Chasyn Rance at the show.. Havent seen him in a while and he was quite..animated and looked like hes been in the gym alot..  Josh Rich was there but his pants no showed...
The match itself went very well for the first time working Naph.. We did some comedy, some chain, I kipped up for the first time in my life!(Thanks Naph) It was voted most entertaining match of the night.. I heard the last 3 matches made the show.. Always great to hear and be a part of those 3...Naph did his plancha gimmick and I caught him(Im not Jimmy Rave..lol..) and on the way down he actually landed, sat on my right shoulder and rolled off.. .Impressive.. Hit the sitout spine buster, then also hit the regular one. Ended up with baby powder in the eyes after a ref bump, and 2 shining wizards later, Naphtali is your new NNW cruiserweight champ...

I hate to say this but there are gonna be some changes made soon, I think they will be for the good, at least for me(and thats all that matters) but there will be some people that are gonna be upset, sad, or dissapointed or all 3 in 1. But all I have to say is, I have to what I have to do. I will announce more later on, but this is all for now...


"" When the love in your heart is gone, its time to move on""

I love you all."

"event","Thought I would put some laughter out there for you guys.. enjoy it..


Joe wanted to buy a motorbike. He doesn`t have much luck until, one
day, he comes across a Harley with a `for sale` sign on it.

The bike seems even better than a new one, although it  is 10 years
old. It is shiny and in absolute mint condition. He immediately buys it, 
and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition  for 10 
years. ""Well, it`s quite simple, really,"" says the seller,  ""whenever 
the bike is outside and it`s going to rain, rub Vaseline on the  chrome. 
It protects it from the rain."" And he hands Joe a jar of  Vaseline.

That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet  her
parents. Naturally, they take the bike there.
But just before they  enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, ""I
have to tell you something about  my family before we go in.""

""When we eat dinner, we don`t talk. In fact,  the first person who says
anything during dinner has to do the  dishes.""
""No problem,"" he says. And in they go. Joe is shocked.  Right smack in 
the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.
In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the 
stairs,in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes.

They sit down to  dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word.
As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.
So he leans over and kisses  Sandra. No one says a word. So he reaches 
over and fondles her breasts. Still, nobody says a word. So he stands 
up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table, and screws 
her right there, in  front of her parents.

His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and
her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word. He 
looks at her mom. ""She`s got a great body,"" he thinks. So he grabs
the mom, bends her over the dinner table, and has his way with her every 
which way right there on the dinner table.
Now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, but still, total
silence. All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts 
to rain.

Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his
pocket. Suddenly the father backs away from the table and shouts, ""All 
right, thats enough, I`ll do the  fucking dishes!"""

"event","Girl -- Slow down. Im scared.
Guy -- No this is fun.
Girl -- No its not. Please, its too scary!
Guy -- Then tell me you love me.
Girl -- Fine, I love you. Slow down!
Guy -- Now give me a BIG hug.
-=Girl hugs him=-
Guy -- Can you take my helmet off & put it on yourself? Its bugging me.


(In the paper the next day):

A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only one survived.

The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy had realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him & felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live, even though it meant that he would die.

If there's anyone you love this much, re-post this.

"event","Well the vacation is over and I go back to work tomorrow.. Shit!!!!! It was nice and relaxing and didnt do much.... Still want to see Team America:World Police... 
Last night was FPWA's Ring of Horror@State Theatre... Got there with one of Keirns students named Kris... Ive known him for a while.. Good kid....Get there about 530 say hi to everyone, seen people I havent seen in a while, get chewed out over a misunderstanding that got corrected(it was a chewing out that I deserved and I gotit). 
Saw alot of hot chicks walking through downtown St Pete and Kris and I asked ourselves, what the hell is going on tonight. Well it was 98.7's  last damn show... So the show started it was a good crowd, I watch some of the matches before mine....

I would say match of the night was Psychdelics vs Powers of Pat.. Crowd was way into those 2 young men... and they came out victorious...
I worked Leon Scott, it was a lot of fun as we are friends and have a lot of respect for each other, so we were snug on a lot of stuff..Good times indeed... NWA FL front office was there watching, and they liked it so thats cool.. everyone else liked it and said it was a good one.. I thought it could have been better but shit happens...

God paid and left...ankle was killing me..So Kris and I took off and ended up at Dollys Dockside for $10 all the beer you can drink!!! Love that special... Not really alot of chicks there like the last time I was there.... Then NWA Fl showed up... Ron, Aaron, Rod, Frankie, Marcus,and Dennis(a fan). Big thank you to Frankie for buying my beer, he offered and I was very grateful.. Just talked about the whole tag scene and they offered advice...

Highlight of the night was seeing Marcus Dillon , the big bitch that he is, moving around like fucking James Brown.. The kid  was dancing his ass off like he was on Soul Train, and to top it off , he finished in a split!!!!! Impressive to say the least but Im sure his nuts hurt him today!!!

Hung out there, got a little tipsy, still remember calling Madison and he said""Im hammered, going home, dont call me till tomorrow!!!!"" Too funny! Oh and Madison did the flaming matchbook trick for the bartender at State Theatre.... 

Also met Bens buddy Kiel and his sister... Kiel is a big tall dude.. Nice guy though..and glad to hear my lil bro Ben is ok after landing on his head...Kiels sister is gorgeous! Wow.. 

Weikel Bearer was awesome...He even took a bump! Wow... But I know 2 other people who took bumps on the floor that night too! Named Romeo and Leon Scott.. Yeah that shit  was unexpected but it got a good reaction so I had to return the favor to Leon!

Oh yeah and Tia's Tex Mex on Fowler on Fri night, is chock full of hot women... Sweet Jesus was the women smoking ass hot in that place.. Think they were mostly like 21-25 in age.. but smoking nonetheless...

Well Im off to bed... See ya later!"

Saw Madison, Banks, and Kris at Green Iguana on Wed night... Good times were had.... and Madison did his flaming matchbook trick... If you havent seen it, it is a must see...

Currently in a weird mood for like the past 2 weeks....Not really feeling anything to be honest and have to make some decisions about what I want to do... God I suck at making decisions....

NWA Sunray was fun...Worked Bad Dog Bullock and had a good time...Got beat by him with a very sweet looking rock bottom(had to see it to experience it), met Des, Dayana, and Megan(I wont call you V-Unit Princess ever again!). I went up with Fan in the Corner as we always go on road trips... and it was funny when I told Des and them who he was, they were like""Your fan in the corner?, Wow its so nice to see you!""  Fan in the Corner=OVER with the message board fans.

Went to physical therapy for my neck.. Seems I have a pinched nerve and the therapist massaged my neck, and when I asked her if I get ""happy ending"" she looked at me like I was crazy...HA HA HA....

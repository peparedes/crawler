"event","man.. i cant wait till these next weeks coming up. they are going to be one of the best. going back home should be fun. i miss mom and dad 2:) they are the best. as for the presents.. haha rent sucks. all those peeps that pay rent know what im talking about. no money left for anything. makes me sad... that brings me to my next thing.. why is everyone always sad?? i havent grasped that concept yet. it seems like everyone is in this slump or something.. but ill be the guy that brings them out of it. i really hate seeing people upset. i mean its ok to be upset for a lil but to hold onto something is such a waste. thats when it really starts draging you down. i mean i could go on and on why i should be sad as heck but i got so much to live for and the things that happen in my life between these years means very little in the big picture. if something is bothering you talk to someone about it.. they might have gone through that same thing. people are like that. if someone is hurting you.. let them go!! not worth it, at all. ah.. well there. hope everyone is staying warm. peace"

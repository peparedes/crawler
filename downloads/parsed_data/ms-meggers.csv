"event","Around 3 am this morning, I was nearly thrown out of my bed by what felt and sounded like a truck hitting my house.  There was a loud bang followed by a a few more thunder sounds, and my whole house shook.  The initial bang shook the house so hard that dishes fell off the shelves in my kitchen.  I was so shocked, I thought maybe I dreamed it had happened, and I got out of bed and looked out the window to see if there was anything outside.  The street was quiet and dark, and then I saw a few people running down the middle of the street towards the park and one of them yelled ""call 911!""  I put on a sweatshirt and miraculously found my glasses in a matter of seconds and went downstairs.  My neighbors were standing by the front door, and Deanna was crying.  I asked what was going on, and she said she thought that Eastern Propane had blown up.

When I stepped out the front door and looked down the street towards the park, I saw what I can only describe as a pillar of fire and a mushroom cloud of black smoke across the river.  It was so huge it really looked like the whole city of Danvers was on fire.  I was terrified not knowing what it was.  The guy next door thought a plane had crashed, and another woman was talking about terrorists.  It was crazy.  I decided I needed to go back to sleep, and I would be fine since it was across the river, but I was still close enough that the fire lit up the whole sky outside my house, and I could hear sirens and helicoptors everywhere.  The fire was probably about a mile away from my house.

When the news finally came on, I learned it was a chemical plant that exploded.  It looks like a war zone.  Houses and businesses leveled.  It's amazing nobody was killed.  Anyway, now that I'm totally exhausted from that whole ordeal, I'm trying to make it through a couple more hours of school before I leave for NYC.  I think I might actually be able to fall asleep on the bus."

"event","So things have been a little busy lately with two jobs, a boyfriend, youth ministry, etc.  On Saturday I went to Walmart with Jason in Salem, NH to get the tires on his car rotated.  I guess I had never been in a Walmart Supercenter, and it was quite the experience.  They have a hair salon, vision center, nail salon, car care, Subway and a whole supermarket in the Walmart.  Wow.

So we ended up spending almost 6 hours at the Walmart, because there was a really long wait to get the car fixed.  Not the way we planned things, but what better way is there to really get to know your significant other than spending 6 hours in Walmart on a Saturday?  We walked around the grocery part collecting samples, checked out the hunting and fishing gear, pulled out chairs to sit in the furniture aisle for a while, read magazines, praised the beer selection (I love NH grocery stores), played peek-a-boo with some little kid and changed the windshield wipers on the car.

We were walking through the grocery store part when a woman passed us with a corn dog that looked amazing, and both of us at the same time were like, where can we get one of those.  So we walked around Walmart with our corn dogs, and I thought, this is definitely the guy for me.

On Wednesday Jason and I are going to New York City for Thanksgiving.  We're going to the parade and 5th Avenue and the big tree at Rockefeller Center and who knows what else.  I'm really excited to check it all out.

I finally got an email response from British Airways about my laptop, and they basically said tough luck, should have brought your laptop on the plane.  Would have done that if they had let me bring it on the plane.  Stupid bastards.  Now that I finally have a claim reference number I can really call and give them hell.  ...In the most Christ-like way possible, of course.

Anyway, not letting that ruin this week.  It's gonna be great.  Happy Thanksgiving everyone!"

Jason Wood seems to be sticking around, and I am very glad.  We went to upstate NY for Tim's family weekend at Paul Smith's College with my parents and my brothers and a bunch of my brothers' teenage friends.  There was freezing rain, snow, woodsmen games, bad punk music and Derek, and Jason didn't flee over the border into Canada or anything, so I think things are going well.

I got really sick on Halloween, so that was a bummer.  One of the teachers I work with was telling me her daughter told her grandma she wanted to be a bunny for Halloween.

I had the greatest weekend hanging out with my worship team pals at our retreat all day on Saturday.  We had amazing food, great conversations, great prayer time...  It was all just so cool.  We sat around a kitchen table singing praise songs just grinning at each other, because it was awesome.

At the end of the retreat day, I had to go over and lead middle school youth group with Cheryl, and I was a little bit nervous about the two of us handling all those kids.  It was only the boys who showed up, and we just had the best time together.  We played basketball and talked, and I did a little sermon that ended up going for more than half an hour, because the guys were so into it!  Absolutely amazing!

Also amazing, Jason finally asked me out, and we went out to dinner and to get Amber at the airport.  I just feel so blessed to have done so many fun things this weekend with people I love to spend time with.  Hopefully it's a trend that will continue now that I'm no longer a slave to the Gap."

We played with these little guys everyday, and apparently we were the first group of white people who stayed there to ever treat the staff and their kids like friends.  And this is at a Christian conference center!  We learned a lot of Zulu words from our friends, and when we left we were able to leave a pretty large tip to be split amongst the staff members.  Apparently the amount they each received was about what they would make in 3 weeks, and they were so overjoyed they wept and danced and sang and hugged us and laughed and hugged us again.  Most of these women were raising another family members young children, and some were supporting multiple families because of AIDS deaths.  It was amazing to bring that much joy to people who were in so much pain.

This guy Dave who came with a church from the south shore asked me if I wanted to go on a ricksha ride while we were shopping the street vendors' stands along the beach.  I just said sure and jumped in.  This crazy Indian guy who spoke almost no english pulled us down the street a little ways.  He was singing to himself and waving at people the whole way.  We had no idea where he was taking us, and we were not really in a safe part of town, but I wasn't really nervous about it at all.  The ricksha cart has a wheel on the back so that it can tip all the way back really close to the ground and keep rolling, so Dave and I got flipped upside down a few times.

Clipped it?  Took it clean off the car!  I was parked facing the wrong direction, but I was parked very close to the curb so there shouldn't have been any problem getting by me.

I called the number on the card and got the wife of the guy who owns the driving school.  She took all my contact info, and then she started suggesting that it was my fault the student driver hit my car.  ""Wasn't your car parked on the wrong side of the street?  Don't your mirrors fold in?""  I'm not the one who hit a parked car, jerk.

So the guy who owns the driving school called me this afternoon, and he told me to go see one of his former students, ""Teddy"", at C & G Auto.  Teddy will fix everything.  The guy proceeded to ask me when I graduated from Gordon, what I do for a living, how old I am and would I ever consider teaching driving school.  He also told me Teddy is single and very attractive.  What the crap?"

I love that I get to connect with people I haven't seen since high school and all kinds of random people I used to know, but some of them are a little freakier than I remember.

Went to a little get together at Jake and Lauren's for 4th of July.  We ate a lot of good food and played a little croquet.  I enjoy croquet, although I don't think I had played since I was about 10 year old.  I enjoy most sports that can be played while drinking beer actually.  ...bowling, fishing, pool, golf.  Good times.  There was a bit of a rain delay in the game, so we watched Peter Pan.  Wow, such a sketcy movie to watch as an adult.  There's a whole lot kids are not picking up on.  Or at least I hope they aren't.

Don't worry.  We're not like the Kennedys or anything.  The blue house is the one my grandma grew up in, although it's nothing like it was back then.  Major renovations have been done.  Last year, my grandparents bought the shack next door, leveled it and built the little house.  Right now there are some old people who rent it from them.

The main house can hold a lot of people.  There are only 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, but there are sofa beds on the porch and everywhere, and the attic has sleeping space for at least 14.  We call the attic the dormitory, and this year I was the dorm parent for all my cousins.  I didn't get much sleep between the 16 year old kiddies staying up late telling silly jokes and laughing and carrying on and the little guys waking up in the middle of the night scared of thunderstorms.  I played Legos, Battleship, Jungle Knights (Brian made it up), and I braided hair.  That's what you do when you're the oldest cousin.

Anyway, this past weekend was all about my Grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary, which is a pretty huge event to celebrate.  I made a powerpoint show with over 350 pictures from the past 50 years for them, and we played it at the party.  Music, transitions, the whole deal.  I've been working on it for the last 3 months or so.  It was a big hit at the party, but also annoying, because none of the old people understand how powerpoint works.  Or even a laptop for that matter.  So many stupid questions.

I also got a ton of the ""so what are you doing with your life now"" questions.  Awesome.  I work at the Gap.  Yes, I went to college.  Yes, I graduated with a double major and almost a minor.  Yes, I did have a full-time job for a division of the Washington Post Company where I did make a lot of money, but now I work at the Gap.

"event","So I spent this past weekend with my family in upstate NY which is always amusing, but before I get to the string of updates on that, I forgot to write about the dead bird incident from last week.

I can't even begin to describe how disgusting and funny and sad this was all at the same time, but I'll try.  I came out into my living room after I had gotten up, got dressed, had breakfast, and I was planning to sit on my couch and watch Sportscenter while I did a little Kaplan work.  I turned the corner into the room and there was a dead bird in the window by the door.  The window was half open, and the bird was stuck in between the top and botton of the window.  I'm not really sure how it got in there, but once it got in it could not get out, and it literally beat it's brains out trying to get out.  Just so you have an accurate picture here: dead bird with brains and feathers splattered all over the window.

I didn't scream or anything, but I just kind of stood there, because I really did not know what to do.  My roommate was out of town, so I couldn't consult with her.  I guess I knew I had to clean it up, but I continued to sit there for a full 10 minutes trying to think of anyone I could call to come clean it up for me.  After I decided I could not call my dad, I put on rubber gloves and got a couple of trash bags, Clorox wipes and tongs.  There was no doubt the bird was dead, but I just could not bring myself to touch it.  I really thought I would throw up, and I have never had a weak stomach.

In the end, I was a big girl, and I cleaned it all up by myself.  People ask me how I know I want to get married someday, and situations like this are exactly the reason.  Call me old fashioned, but cleaning up dead birds should be the husband's job.  ...after he takes out the trash and mows the lawn.  Kidding of course.  Don't leave hateful comments.

"event","I feel like everytime I update this thing some dramatic life-changing event has occured.  This time, I quit my job.  Yes, the job I worked so hard for, and wanted so much, and totally loved...  I had to walk away.

I've been working nearly 60+ hours a week since I started in January.  I love the job, and the people and work are interesting, but that's just too many hours.  My boss has been apologetic right along, saying the situation will improve as soon as the staffing crisis is under control, etc.  Bottom line is that in 5 months nothing has changed much, and her demands for me to do some of the things I'm doing at work are totally unreasonable for my position and salary.

I had a review meeting with my boss, and she basically told me I'm not working hard enough, she's not convinced I'm committed to the team, my ""bad attitude"" is causing problems, and I need to start working Sundays, because that's part of the job.  I replied that a whole lot of what I've been doing is not at all what I agreed to when I took the job, and I am not willing to work on Sundays too.  She told me to go home and consider my future with Kaplan, and I told her I quit.

Plain and simple really.  My last day will be June 2nd, and then I'll get 5 paid vacation days after that, because I haven't taken a single day off the whole time I've been working there.

I have absolutely no idea what comes after that.  I am, of course, looking for work.  None of this is what I expected, but I was in the same position last year and managed to survive.

It's all good."

I made the rounds yesterday to Barnes and Noble, Panera and Starbucks, doing errands, visiting peeps and grading SAT practice test essays.  Friday night I worked until 8:30 and went out to Applebee's with my boss and a co-worker.  Yeah, Happy Saint Patty's.  Other than that, I've been teaching a whole lot of SAT prep and trying to sleep.

I went to a white trash party with Jen a couple weeks ago.  That was fun.  I wore orange lipstick so hideous I don't even think I can post the pics.  Jen did post them on Facebook though.

I've been so tired lately.  Today was long with church and worship team and everything.  I'm taking a 2 week break from church, mainly so I can sleep in on Sundays.  I haven't been able to sleep well at all for a few weeks now, and I think it's really starting to make me sick.  Maybe I am just catching the generic plague that's going around.  That was bound to happen sooner or later.

I made a mix today of early - mid 90's CCM hits.  It's great and terrible and laughable all at the same time.  I can't decide if I should title it ""WOW, who still listens to that?"" or ""The 'Mine eyes have seen the glory' Remix"" (the latter would be mainly for Athena).  We'll see.

"event","My new neighbors really suck.  When I moved in it was one girl in the first floor apartment, two guys in the second floor apartment and me and Amber on the third floor.  The girl and the two guys all moved out, and new people moved in at the beginning of February.  It's this guy and his girlfriend and their kid.

First of all, they smoke non-stop.  It was so bad the first few days they were here, that I was seriously getting sick and having asthma attacks, because it was seeping into our apartment.  We called the landlord, because it's supposed to be a non-smoking building, and it seems to have died down a little, but I swear I still smell it in the building all the time.  It's disgusting.

These people don't work.  Their car is always here.  They must have somebody bring them cigarettes, because I don't even see them go out for those.  They do manage to produce an incredible amount of disgusting trash, which they leave in the back stairwell, stinking up the place and blocking a fire exit.

They leave their shoes outside the door to their apartment, which is fine if it's like three or four pairs of shoes.  It's actually at least ten pairs of shoes, and most of them are cheap, pointy-toed heels that look like bad knock-offs from Walmart.  ...and the little boy's camo snow boots that look like they have holes in them.  Sometimes he leaves his thread-bare little winter coat outside the door too.

For a while, we didn't think they ever let the little boy out.  He's at least 5 or 6, but he doesn't seem to go to school, because nobody ever leaves in the morning to take him there.  I hear him downstairs bouncing around sometimes, and then I hear somebody yelling at him to shut up.  They did let him out to play on the patio in the back yard the other day.  It looks like they sent him out there with some poster paint and sidewalk chalk.  From my window, I could see some twisted looking faces he had drawn, and big splatters of paint everywhere.  This kid needs therapy.

The mom needs it too I think.  Everytime I've had to knock on their door, for parking arrangements or whatever, she's in her bathrobe with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth looking drunk or hung over.  I'm reminded of Jeff Foxworthy...

"event","Since I'm stuck here, I guess I might as well update.  The snow drifts are so bad at my house my car was totally covered.  Seriously, you couldn't see it at all.  Everything's shoveled out now, but I'll probably have to shovel again tomorrow, cause the wind is still howling.

My job that I was so excited about has kinda taken a turn for the worst.  I still really like what I do, but the situation in the office has gotten really bad, because we are so short-staffed.  I don't know why we can't seem to hire more people and fix things, but I've been under way too much pressure to get things done with little to no resources.  Very frustrating and exhausting situation.

I do really like the people I work with.  Alli hosted a party with this foundation she's a part of called Cities Unite.  It was a mardi gras themed thing at Jose McIntyre's in Boston, and I brought Dawn, Hailey and Amber.  It was expensive, but all the money goes to New Orleans, so it was worth it.  I had a lot of fun with the girls and with Krystal and Rich from my office.  Krystal and I have so much in common.  We both like the same beer, we wear the same clothes, we eat the same donuts, we order the same sandwiches....  It's crazy.

Today I've done nothing productive.  I played DDR for almost an hour.  I think I might make brownies.

I did do some research into this trip to South Africa I'm planning.  I'm really getting excited about it, and I have to make an official committment to go by the end of this week, so I'm waiting to hear about the rest of the details.

I got the FM transmitter thing for my MP3 player.  It's glorious.  I think my driving has now reached an all time level of craziness with the Starbucks, the cell phone, the radio, the CD player and the MP3 player.  Maybe Massachusetts really is the right place for me to live."

"event","Several of you have asked what exactly I do at my new job, and it's actually slightly complex.

My title is Classroom Coordinator for Kaplan Test Prep and Admissions, Boston Pre-College.  Basically, my office is responsible for running a few hundred Kaplan SAT Prep courses all over Eastern Mass, the Cape and Southern NH.  I manage the part-time teaching staff that actually goes to these locations to teach the classes.  Before I was hired full-time I was one of these teachers, and I will still teach at least one class this Spring.

Day to day, I manage the calendar.  I take calls from parents who need to switch their kid into a different class, I call kids and parents to remind them classes are starting, and I assign teachers to each class scheduled.  I have to keep track of teacher payroll, and I also have to get teachers their materials for each class (practice tests, etc.).  I do some teachery things in the office too, including grading essays from the essay section of the SAT and consulting on classroom management of instructional issues.

It is a really fast-paced and intense job.  So far I really like the people I work with.  Everyone at Kaplan is really young, and everyone is very academic.  Not like we're all geeks, but the educational requirements are pretty high.  Even teachers for Kaplan are required to have 90th percentile SAT scores or higher, so everyone at Kaplan got high SAT scores and went to really good colleges.  It's neat to be in an environment where everyone is so well educated, well read and even a little bit competitive.

I'm working pretty long hours, because it's the beginning of the Spring class sessions.  I work from 10-6 technically, so I miss most of the traffic, but the 35 minute commute is still a little rough.  I do check facebook messages and email at work if people want to talk to me, but my cell phone doesn't work in the office building, and I can't really take personal calls at my desk, because I have to answer the customer service line.

So that's my job.  I make more money than I ever thought I would in education, and it's cool."

As we were leaving, Ashley was pushing the cart down the sidewalk towards Best Buy.  Out of nowhere, she stopped really suddenly and slammed into the cart.  I bumped into the back of her, and we were both like, what the heck was that.

We thought the wheel was stuck, or the cart hit a rock or something.  We both tried to push and pull the cart, and we definitely looked retarded.  Then we realized there were a bunch of other carts also stuck to the ground on either side of us and we figured it out.

Targer actually puts a magnet down on the sidewalk so that you can't steal the shopping carts.  That sucker is strong too.  Crazy.

"event","I am encouraged by the number of comments I have received lately that people actually do read this, and so I continue to write stuff.

I heard Reliant K on Kiss 108 tonight.  According to my brother, their latest album is totally mainstream, but I like it.  Very well done.

Coinstar now gives you the option of a gift card rather than cash, if you weren't aware already.  I just went through all my purses the other day, and I had about $35 in change.  This is because I own too many purses, but anyway, I got it all put on a Starbucks gift card.  You can also choose Linens'N'Things and some other stores.  The best part is it doesn't take any money away when you choose a card, unlike the 8 cents it takes out of each dollar when you get cash back.  Brilliant.

I have bought an appalling amount of Gap clothing in the last few days.  I mean seriously dreadful.  I have gathered 3 large paper bags full of clothing I will be giving away, so I feel slightly better and somewhat justified.  Furthermore, in my defense, these are my last few days with an employee discount.  I was born to shop like this.

Finally, a story from work I must share:

A middle-aged man came up to me in the store and pointed out the pants and sweater he wanted to get for his wife.  I thought to myself, this is great.  He already knows what he wants.  (Most guys have no idea.  I'm sorry, but it's true.)  I asked him what size I could get for him, and I nearly laughed out loud at his response.

 <b>""38C""</b>

For any of you who may be somehow unaware, that is unmistakably a woman's bra size.  This man recited that particular combination of characters with the pride of a 3rd grader winning the spelling bee.  He was oblivious to the fact that he really wasn't offering incredibly useful information for buying pants and a sweater, and he was also unaware that his wife might not want the entire North Shore Mall to know the size of that part of her as he repeated it several times, loudly, in our conversation that followed."

On Friday, I was hired by Kaplan Test Prep and Admissions to be the Classroom Coordinator for the satellite office in Waltham.  This is huge for a number of reasons.  For one, it's exactly the type of job I've been looking for.  Two, it's full-time with salary and benefits - even an employee bonus program.  Three, I will make 3 times what I make now.

I could go on and on, but basically it's gonna be awesome.  I'll have a minimum 35 minute commute to Waltham everyday, and I know it will be a challenging job, but I think it will be worth it.

I will miss some of the people I work with at Gap, and definitely my %50 discount, but I think I've bought enough clothes in the last few months that I should be ok for a while.

A huge weight has been lifted.  Christmas Eve is the last day at Gap.  I travel to NY with the family for the week after Christmas, and then I start in Waltham on January 2nd."

"event","I know I have mentioned how Piquantessence and I IM almost every night.  Most of the time it is pretty mundane stuff about how our days went and that sort of thing.  Sometimes we instant message fantasies.  This was one I wrote her on Christmas Eve.  Seemed appropriate since today is New Year's Eve...and I am sitting here without her putting a live journal entry into the works...

khaiote: stop yawning
piquantessence: oh well
piquantessence: I'll try
khaiote: and goto bed
piquantessence: no
piquantessence: Not unless you have to go
khaiote: every one is settled down for a long winter's 
nap, yes?
piquantessence: yes
khaiote: I saw that
piquantessence: ooh. do it again
piquantessence: please
piquantessence: pretty please
khaiote: you are a naughty girl
piquantessence: yes
piquantessence: and your point is?   
piquantessence: oh, I see, on the top of your tongue
khaiote: there is my point
piquantessence: I lie that one
piquantessence: like
khaiote: lie down, you will definitely like it
piquantessence: I know what you can do with that
piquantessence: You are getting me hot
khaiote: I trimmed my beard
piquantessence: I see that
khaiote: it's a little bristly
piquantessence: It looks very nice
piquantessence: it will do nice things
khaiote: things I can do with that too
khaiote: tickle and stimulate
piquantessence: yes
piquantessence: Just what I was thinking
khaiote: drag it down your back and butt
piquantessence: definitley nice
khaiote: flip you over and drag it back up to kiss you
khaiote: drag it from between your legs 
khaiote: all the way up to kiss your mouth
piquantessence: Yes?
khaiote: starting at the back of your neck
khaiote: and only do it an inch or so at a time
piquantessence: I've gone too many days without
khaiote: I finished a fantasy again today
piquantessence: again?
khaiote: yes
khaiote: too many days with out, too
piquantessence: I haven't since, uh, since, uh,          
I don't know
khaiote: in the fantasy it was an interesting ride home...
piquantessence: ride home?
khaiote: an interesting ride to pick up the girls
khaiote: and they drove home
khaiote: we were out of their way in the back
khaiote: with a privacy curtain
piquantessence: ARe you writing a story?
khaiote: then when we reached your house, Tabitha
said for us to go downstairs and get it over with, they 
would wait
piquantessence: Oh. That was the fantasy?
khaiote: ""Sheesh, you guys are worse than ninth 
graders...""
piquantessence: Ninthh?
piquantessence: wow.
piquantessence: You start young
khaiote: so did you
piquantessence: Yeah, duh
piquantessence: I had earlier testostorone
khaiote: I started dating in ninth grade
piquantessence: I haven't finished since you 
finished me on Tuesday! Ha! I remember!
khaiote: remember what?
piquantessence: Awww. See? You were sweet even 
back then
khaiote: being so finished you haven't wanted to?
khaiote: no, you have been too tired
piquantessence: I've been too tired
piquantessence: Today is the first day I don't feel 
exhaustd or too worried
khaiote: yep
khaiote: what would you like, my love?
piquantessence: Waht would I like?
khaiote: tonight, online?
piquantessence: Damn
piquantessence: Just to talk to you
khaiote: okay
khaiote: more later...
piquantessence: It is Chrismas eve
khaiote: yes it is
khaiote: and I sure love you
khaiote: thank you for being the best gift ever
piquantessence: I sure love you too! very much
khaiote: now you can cry
piquantessence: no
khaiote: or get weepy
khaiote: or say ""Khaiote, shut up!""
piquantessence: I wouldn't say that
piquantessence: I would rather get weepy
khaiote: Khaiote, stop talking like that, you are making 
me weepy!
piquantessence: *That* I might say
khaiote: ""I will save my soggy tissues and smear them 
on you, you mean man!""
khaiote: (ugh)
khaiote: Yuck!

piquantessence: I would rather save my soggy 
panties and . .  oh, nevermind
khaiote: oooh!
khaiote: that would be perfectly acceptable...
khaiote: will you take them off while Iwatch?
piquantessence: Now?
khaiote: or do I have to use my imagination?
piquantessence: You do have a good imagination
khaiote: are your panties soggy now?
piquantessence: getting there
khaiote: cool
khaiote: what can I talk about to help
khaiote: ?
piquantessence: Like i said, it's been a few days
piquantessence: Nothing
khaiote: are your nipples sensitive?
piquantessence: it's not that important
piquantessence: yes
khaiote: would you like me to kiss them
khaiote: lick them?
piquantessence: yes
khaiote: pinch them a a little
piquantessence: just a little
khaiote: ah. I know
piquantessence: what?
khaiote: first we get out your new christmas presents
piquantessence: I know where they are!
piquantessence: I can't play tonight though
khaiote: stand in front of a mirror
piquantessence: Sil is still up
khaiote: I know
khaiote: I open your shirt
piquantessence: She wants to go to midnight mass
khaiote: I kiss your neck
khaiote: and run my hands over your breasts
piquantessence: Next time we do that, I get the 
video camera!
piquantessence: I want to be able to watch 
piquantessence: again and again and again
khaiote: I am behind you
khaiote: hopefully you are wearing a front opening bra
piquantessence: I can do that
khaiote: I unhook and open your bra
khaiote: and pick up your new toy
khaiote: gently I put one side on your nipple
khaiote: and snug it up
khaiote: just to the point of *oh!*
khaiote: then I do the other side
khaiote: I could take a short string or small rope and tie 
it to the chain
khaiote: run it down your belly and between your legs
khaiote: up your back
khaiote: around your neck and back down between 
your legs and up to tie again to the chain
khaiote: snug but not tight, I know you don't like 
anything too tight around your neck
khaiote: then I get out your other toy, the new one
khaiote: and find places you want it to stimulate
piquantessence: Lots of places
piquantessence: all over
piquantessence: everywhere
khaiote: all the while stroking you with my free hand
khaiote: and kissing  and licking you
piquantessence: wow
piquantessence: now they are wet
khaiote: maybe using some ice in places too
piquantessence: I like ice
khaiote: I would have to drop my pants
khaiote: and rub my erection against you as I bit your 
neck
piquantessence: Now what am I going to do?
piquantessence: You've gotten me all hot and 
bothered
khaiote: let me tie your wrists together 
piquantessence: Over my head?
khaiote: and force you to bend over
khaiote: yes
khaiote: to the ceiling
khaiote: with just enough play to let you bend over
khaiote: while I continue to rub against you
khaiote: trying to determine if you are wet enough yet
piquantessence: Oh, I dont think you have to worry 
about hat
piquantessence: that
khaiote: you still have your panties on
piquantessence: I do?
piquantessence: wow. 
khaiote: I haven't taken them off yet
piquantessence: I thought they were magically 
gone
khaiote: that;s when I pull out the barber scissors
khaiote: very shart
khaiote: sharp
piquantessence: that long ones?
khaiote: yes
khaiote: I cut the waistband
khaiote: on the right
khaiote: then on the left
khaiote: so the center is still intact
khaiote: I have to touch it to see if it is wet enough yet
khaiote: maybe rub it against you a little, just to make 
sure
khaiote: the ropes are still quite tight
piquantessence: Yummm
khaiote: and your breasts might be a little sensitive right 
now
khaiote: I can always use the little vibrator
khaiote: on your nipples to see if they are numb or not
khaiote: lick them a little
khaiote: I take your panties in my teeth and start pulling 
them out of the ropes,a little at a time
khaiote: do you moan a little?
piquantessence: Yes
piquantessence: maybe a lot more than a little
khaiote: with every small movementof the fabric against 
your very sensitive clit?
piquantessence: Yes
khaiote: eventually i have removed them, but I still have 
the scissors
khaiote: and I start to trim you
khaiote: maybe even get a razor and hot water and 
shaving cream
piquantessence: REally?
khaiote: hmm
khaiote: I think she likes the idea
khaiote: tied up
piquantessence: Intrigued
khaiote: and ropes confining and stimulating
khaiote: and me shaving her
khaiote: gently, thoroughly
khaiote: until she looks like a twelve year old
khaiote: (remember you can see everything that is going 
on, you are standing in front of a mirror)
piquantessence: ah
piquantessence: I was kind of wondering there for a 
minute
khaiote: you are intrigued by the whole thing
piquantessence: yes
khaiote: and especially when I start licking you 
khaiote: you do get even wetter
piquantessence: Not possible
khaiote: your juices run down your legs
khaiote: because of the warmth of the water and the 
warmth of my mouth
khaiote: and because of the sensitivity of the skin from 
just being shaved
khaiote: now I step behind you again
khaiote: and with little silver vibrator in hand, I begin to rub you
khaiote: your breath is coming in quick gasps
khaiote: and I bend you over and enter you from 
behind
khaiote: slowly 
khaiote: only a little at a time
khaiote: letting you feel the vibration of the toy
khaiote: the pull of the ropes
khaiote: the tautness of the chain and the tightness of 
the nipple clips
khaiote: I slide out and back in
khaiote: picking up the tempo
khaiote: faster and deeper
khaiote: until at last you begin to climas
khaiote: climax
khaiote: again and again
khaiote: I feel the pressure building
khaiote: a fiery heat engulfs me starting at the tip of my 
cock
khaiote: it races over my nerves as a wildfire
khaiote: and engulfs you too
khaiote: we are climaxing together and the light washes 
over us 
khaiote: we are displaced and together
khaiote: and we cry out at the same time
khaiote: we can see light
khaiote: we can see outside of ourselves
khaiote: we are energy 
khaiote: we are wonder
khaiote: sweetie?
khaiote: Piq?
khaiote: are you okay?
piquantessence: yes?
piquantessence: yes
khaiote: are you sure?
piquantessence: yes
khaiote: are you weepy?
piquantessence: No.
khaiote: liar
piquantessence: Not sad
khaiote: I see the tears and smeared mascara
khaiote: I know
piquantessence: yeah
khaiote: I like to paint word images for you
piquantessence: Just a release of a lot more than 
just a physical sensation. Kwim?
khaiote: yes
piquantessence: I like it when you do that
khaiote: me too
piquantessence: thank you
khaiote: you are so very welcome
khaiote: it is getting late
khaiote: unfortunately
piquantessence: That was a very, very good one
piquantessence: I know
khaiote: good
khaiote: I am so glad
piquantessence: but the sparklies and all
khaiote: yay!
piquantessence: Goodnight Lover
khaiote: did you touch yourself or was it all done with 
out touching?
piquantessence: I touched
khaiote: okay
khaiote: I couldn't tell
piquantessence: The first couple small ones were 
without though
khaiote: but I could feel the build up
piquantessence: You did?
khaiote: yes
piquantessence: yay!
piquantessence: and then the release?
khaiote: I dont know
piquantessence: You would know
khaiote: but the story timed out at about the same time
piquantessence: It was a good one
piquantessence: I will save this one
khaiote: now you also have to keep in mind that the 
video camera was running 
piquantessence: yes. i did
khaiote: and you will be able to relive this one again 
and again
piquantessence: I'm serious. Next time.
khaiote: and the next time we go to the retreat
khaiote: we will have a *real* porno to show them
khaiote: sorry
piquantessence: damn
piquantessence: every time
khaiote: save this one
piquantessence: I will
khaiote: call it ""The Inadvertent Christmas Present""
piquantessence: Okay
khaiote: I do have to go
khaiote: I love you
piquantessence: I know
piquantessence: I love you


and I do love her, so very much."

"event","I got to spend the evening with Piq, watching her do what she does.  And she is very good at it on many levels.  Don't think I don't know that you, as you read this, are thinking naughty thoughts, that part came later, after the work -- she is very serious and dedicated in her craft.  We made our amusements later.  I guess I should call them amusements and amazements, but I am sure you don't want to hear the sordid and steamy details. 

I was in the shower this morning and, unbidden, a line or three rose in my imagination.  Something that hasn't happened for a long time.
            ""I remember when she stepped into my life,
             It happened without great fanfare or shock.
             She stood at the sideline of all my antic activity
             And waited for me to pay attention to the important things                  again."" 

Not good as it stands, poems can almost always use a lot of tweaking at first. but the sentiment is there.  She waited and called my attention from time to time until I realized what a wondrous thing was waiting for me. *sigh*  I admire her patience.  I thank her for it often.  

I am not the poet she is, but the whole thing got started with a poem I wrote.  I will have to let you read it sometime.  

Do you remember when you fell in love?"

"event","The holiday comes and goes and unfortunately I cannot be with Piq.  *sigh*  I know, I'm a wimp and I can't even talk about us the way I would like because it would be too incriminating...too many clues about her life might give ammunition to people who deserve to be drawn and quartered, but continue to sail on thru life unaware of the damage they wreak around them.  

The turkey was good, the vegetables were good, the gravy was fine.  And yours?

We managed to spend a weekend together not long ago.  And even though her health was not what she wanted -- periods of dizziness and more -- we had time for each other like we haven't had in a long time.  Even a shower together.  YUM!

I am not feeling particularly poetic, but I do miss her.  Usually we IM at night, but not tonight--the needs of her life are keeping her busy. Sorry folks, a little melancholy.  Typical for holidays, huh?"

"event","I haven't been here in such a long time.  And I know that lots and lots of things have happened since the last time.  I am still with Piquantessence and still desperately in love and lust with her. Almost two years and things just get better.  I am pursuing some of the things that fascinate me -- both in the day to day venue and in the metaphysical.  Ran into someone I have known for a while at a recent gathering and we were both surprised that the other is pursuing the same kind of path. 

Piq is out today, with her family, doing things that they like to do. :::sigh:::  miss her I do...

I don't know what else I care to talk about right now, but if more things pop up, rest assured, you all will be brought up to date."

"event","We often IM, she and I. Sometimes we get creative and teasing at the same time. We had been talking for about a half an hour when I was seized with inspiration.  She had queried me about whether I felt like I was settling down with her, becoming, in effect an old fart.  I wanted to assure her that the passion is still present and raging.  Let me know if you think I succeeded.

The actual story starts about 10:24.  But I liked the playful banter that lead up to it.  That's why it's included.


piquantessence (10:16:33 PM): Looks like you just 
came up with a punk group name
Khaiote (10:16:39 PM): it seems to me there is a metal 
band called ""Stain""
piquantessence (10:16:47 PM): Yes there is
Khaiote (10:17:09 PM): see? I'm not totally clueless...
piquantessence (10:17:15 PM): But as long as you 
have the ""White"" in front of it, you're okay.
piquantessence (10:17:23 PM): I knew that!
piquantessence (10:17:31 PM): And I never said you 
were!
piquantessence (10:17:37 PM): Did I?
Khaiote (10:17:45 PM): and actually it could be ""white 
stains""  -- with the ess at the end
piquantessence (10:17:46 PM): Now I can't rememer!
piquantessence (10:17:55 PM): Oh my God! Did I call 
you clueless?
piquantessence (10:18:03 PM): If I did... shit!
Khaiote (10:18:04 PM): about music?
piquantessence (10:18:12 PM): I'm just teasing.
piquantessence (10:18:22 PM): Ess at the end?
Khaiote (10:18:24 PM): that's the general concensus 
around this house...
piquantessence (10:18:32 PM): How do you prounounce 
that?
Khaiote (10:18:34 PM): yes, the letter ess
piquantessence (10:18:43 PM): isn't it es's?
Khaiote (10:18:48 PM): no
piquantessence (10:18:53 PM): Oh, okay
piquantessence (10:18:58 PM): I thought it was plural
Khaiote (10:19:09 PM): ppplllllllp
piquantessence (10:19:15 PM): Aren't you glad I am 
not around your house?
Khaiote (10:19:20 PM): no
piquantessence (10:19:26 PM): Are those like . . . 
raspberries?
Khaiote (10:19:33 PM): if you were, things would be very 
interesting.
Khaiote (10:19:41 PM): yes, raspberries
piquantessence (10:20:09 PM): well, you just told me 
what the consesus is around your house and if I 
was around there, wouldn't the consesnsus still 
pretty much be the same?
piquantessence (10:20:31 PM): And don't ask me to 
try to spell consensus again!
piquantessence (10:20:34 PM): Thats it!
Khaiote (10:20:49 PM): only if you agreed with My family.
piquantessence (10:20:50 PM): I like your raspberries
piquantessence (10:21:10 PM): And we already know I 
don't agree with that. So it's a moot point
piquantessence (10:21:22 PM): Back to those 
raspberries . . .
piquantessence (10:21:36 PM): Do it again! 
;-):::sigh::::
Khaiote (10:21:36 PM): okay -- the raspberries
Khaiote (10:21:42 PM): ppppplllllllllp
piquantessence (10:21:51 PM): Thank you!
Khaiote (10:21:56 PM): PPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLP!!
piquantessence (10:22:00 PM): I love it when you 
accomodate my needs!
piquantessence (10:22:02 PM): Ooooh!
piquantessence (10:22:05 PM): A big one!
Khaiote (10:22:14 PM): *my* big one
piquantessence (10:22:25 PM): Now the da#n cat 
wants out!
piquantessence (10:22:36 PM): You're big one is rather 
nice.
piquantessence (10:22:42 PM): ::sigh::: I miss you
Khaiote (10:22:46 PM): I try my best
piquantessence (10:23:10 PM): I hope you really don't 
*try* that hard.
piquantessence (10:23:24 PM): I like to think most of 
it comes natural to you.
Khaiote (10:23:32 PM): you already know what it is that I 
try hard..
piquantessence (10:23:50 PM): Yes. I do.
piquantessence (10:24:01 PM): And you are wonderful 
at everything ---
piquantessence (10:24:07 PM): so far. :-D
Khaiote (10:24:11 PM): ""the gravel in her driveway 
crunched under my feet as I picked my way in the dark""
piquantessence (10:24:23 PM): oooh! a story!
piquantessence (10:24:35 PM): :::sitting quietly 
listening:::
Khaiote (10:24:47 PM): ""all the lights in the house  were 
off and I wanted to leave her a surprise in her van.""
piquantessence (10:25:39 PM): And suddenly the 
inspiration vanished?
Khaiote (10:25:51 PM): no, just making some story 
decisions
piquantessence (10:26:09 PM): Go with what flows 
Khaiote (10:26:13 PM): and I don't want to have to start 
each sentence with a quote mark
piquantessence (10:26:20 PM): Then don't
piquantessence (10:26:39 PM): I can read the difference 
between story telling and you talking.
Khaiote (10:27:30 PM): The whole neighborhood was 
quiet at this time of the night. Most respectable people 
were probably in bed, either asleep or nodding in front of 
a droning late night TV host.
Khaiote (10:28:57 PM): I approached the van and looked 
around to make sure no one was likely watching me.  she 
had teased me about being a stalker and it was always 
fun to tease her back.
Khaiote (10:30:16 PM): I opened the driver side door to 
drop the picture of me on the seat, when a vagrant 
breeze carried the furry aroma of cigarette smoke to me.
Khaiote (10:31:00 PM): I turned and looked toward her 
porch and saw the tell-tale glow of the cigarette in the 
murky dark.
Khaiote (10:32:10 PM): ""shit!""  I whispered under my 
breath.
The glowing cigarette flipped through the air and into the 
damp lawn.
Khaiote (10:33:35 PM): Her whispery voice carried across 
the yard, ""I was wondering what you were doing.  I 
wondered who you were at first, but I recognized your 
walk and your ... clothes
Khaiote (10:33:42 PM): ""
Khaiote (10:34:20 PM): I eased the driver's door shut and 
walked over to the porch where she sat.
Khaiote (10:34:40 PM): ""I was hoping to leave you a 
surprise.""

Khaiote (10:34:57 PM): ""I like surprises.""
Khaiote (10:35:21 PM): I could hear the smile in her voice.
Khaiote (10:35:30 PM): ""what is the surprise you left me?""
Khaiote (10:36:06 PM): ""Yiou could wait until morning, or 
you can go over and find out for yourself.""
Khaiote (10:37:36 PM): when she walked off the porch, it 
was my turn to be surprised.  she wore a light tank top 
and panties, with a kimono style robe loosely wrapped 
around her
Khaiote (10:39:14 PM): she sidled over to the van and 
kissed me lightly.  I could taste the salty, smokey flavor 
of the cigarette on her mouth and felt the warmth of her 
body thru her light clothes.
piquantessence (10:39:35 PM): :::sigh:::
Khaiote (10:39:45 PM): she opened the door and picked 
up the envelope on the carseat
Khaiote (10:41:32 PM): I stepped behind her and 
wrapped my arms around her waist as she extracted the 
photo. There was a sharp intake of breath when she 
realized what the photo was.
piquantessence (10:41:47 PM): What? What? What is 
it???
Khaiote (10:42:24 PM): I had arranged a camera with a 
remote shutter switch and captured the exact moment of 
a climax while I masturbated.
piquantessence (10:42:33 PM): Cool!
piquantessence (10:42:40 PM): :-D
Khaiote (10:42:54 PM): ""Oh my..."" she sighed. ""Is this for 
me?""
Khaiote (10:43:42 PM): I rubbed my hardening member 
against her round backside.  
""you know it is.  I like to give you things...""
Khaiote (10:44:06 PM): I slid my hand under her tank top 
and cupped her breasts
piquantessence (10:44:42 PM): :::sigh:::
Khaiote (10:45:28 PM): The nipples felt tight and hard. 
Probably influenced by the cool night and the explicit 
photograph.  
Khaiote (10:45:55 PM): She leaned against me, rubbing 
my hard on with her ass.
Khaiote (10:46:42 PM): I kissed her on the neck.  A small 
moan escaped from somewhere deep in her chest.  
Khaiote (10:47:13 PM): ""Is this picture the only reason 
you're here?""
Khaiote (10:47:56 PM): I slid my hand down into her 
panties and felt her wetness. ""I hope it isn't the only 
reason.""
Khaiote (10:48:07 PM): ""Me, too.""
piquantessence (10:48:53 PM): And now I miss you 
even more. If that's possible
Khaiote (10:49:07 PM): I unzipped my pants and felt her 
hands explore the open fly.
piquantessence (10:49:16 PM): There's more?
piquantessence (10:49:24 PM): Yay!
Khaiote (10:50:11 PM): she pulled my rock-hard member 
free of it's encumbring clothing and I could feel the cool 
prickling of the night air on my hot cock.
Khaiote (10:50:34 PM): ""do we do this?"" I asked.
Khaiote (10:50:48 PM): ""Do we do what?"" she answered.
Khaiote (10:51:29 PM): I pulled her panties down and slid 
my fingers into her wetness.  ""This.""
Khaiote (10:53:17 PM): I leaned her into her van and 
pushed up behind her.  she reached around to guide my 
maleness into her.  the warmth encompassed me as I slid 
into her slowly.  She bit off her breath and sighed.
Khaiote (10:53:44 PM): Our rhythm built, stoke by stroke.  
Khaiote (10:54:22 PM): second by second
piquantessence (10:58:31 PM): My goodness! What is 
are they doing?
Khaiote (10:58:40 PM): Her moans and mine intermixed 
and drifted over the dark landscape.  Our tempo built 
until we both knew that it could not last much longer.  fire 
filled my night as she cried out in ecstasy.  We both 
pushed against each other extracting every last erg and 
atom of pleasure.  I was for her and I knew, deep in my 
dreaming soul, she felt the same for me. 
We collapsed on the car seat and caught our breaths.  
Kissing
Khaiote (10:58:46 PM): touching
Khaiote (10:58:54 PM): stroking 
Khaiote (10:59:10 PM): and learning each other all over 
again.
piquantessence (10:59:24 PM): What a wonderful 
bedtime story.
piquantessence (10:59:29 PM): Thank you."

"event","I was inspired to write a poem for Piquantessence, even though the poem has yet to be written.  The source and wellspring of that inspiration was begun on Saturday night.  We were together for a longer time than what we are usually able to steal and we were able to achieve some things we hadn't been able to before.  

But last night, oh, my, god...  We were together and at first, neither of us was much in a mood to be intimate, so we talked and touched.  I found myself in a mood that ultimately surprised her on several levels.  We made love at last and I had a climax unlike any I can remember ever having before.  I felt like I was buffeted by high winds, I was spun around, lifted up and held aloft for an unknown period of time, then dropped gently even from the heights I was being held in.  I fell into the warm, crystal clear waters of a tropical ocean.  This didn't result in my drowning, it was only my need for a cushioned landing that allowed me to live. I shook while I recovered and gulped at the air.  Understand this was not a discomfort, I would repeat this in a second if I knew precisely what it was that we did differently from our usual.  When I explained what wonder occurred with me, she said this is what her orgasm is usually like and if that's the case, I certainly understand why she pursues them so avidly.  I'm also happy to be able to help in some small way.

I've been told I have a gift for understatement..."

"event","I had a dream this morning and I think it may have been someone trying to contact me.

The set up was me working in a situation not too dissimilar to what I work in now -- cubicles and windows, aisles and all.  I can remember dealing with people and seeing cubicles other than the one I worked in.  I reached a point in the dream where I was told by a supervisor that I had to move to another area.

I didn't know where the other area was and I asked around for it.  A woman and a man showed up -- int the dream, they were good and trusted friends on mine.  They said they had found where I was supposed to be.  They set out to guide me, chatting and walking.  I kept getting sidetracked by avoiding people blocking my way, or getting stopped to indulge in desultory conversation with strangers along the way.  We left the building we were in and I found myself in an area that reminded me of the campus at IUP.  I had lost my two friends but had the sense they had gone into a particular building across the quad.

I walked into the building, still not finding my associates -- apparently they had blithely continued on to the goal of my new workspace without me -- involved in their own private conversation, ignoring the fact that I was no longer with them.

There were stairs in this building -- more like a university classroom building than an office complex -- with a man sitting on the landing of the large stairway, with a large cardboard or posterboard placard on his lap.

I tried to get past him, but he said something like, ""It's about time you got here; I wish you wouldn't be late for appointments.""  I realized he had names and other information written on the big piece of posterboard in his lap.

I tried to explain that I wasn't who he seemed to think I was, but he could not be dissuaded from his notion that he was waiting specifically for me.  He indicated by conversation that I should sit down so we could begin the review and he ""really wish(ed)[I] would would bring all the handouts [I] was given about this.""

I sat in stunned amazement as he started talking.  As we sat there a heavy set woman (not fat, just a little on the overweight side) came down the stairs.  She seemed to have some kind of physical disability and for some reason, got hung up on the posterboard, then fell down.  When the woman apologized profusely for tripping and interrupting us, she pointed out the minor malformation of her foot, which I then noticed.  There was a little more discussion, and I woke up.

As some extra information, the man on the stairs did not seem very dream-like and seemed very intent on dealing with me.  He had information to impart, or some kind of conversational goal he was intent on reaching.

Any body else have interesting dreams lately?"

"event","Piquantessence and I were forcibly separated for a fairly extended period of time for reasons beyond our control.  I don't know that ""painful"" really describes how that time passed.  I found myself considering whether she would enjoy the things I found myself involved with and I did meditations every day looking for her in places you can't find on maps.  I felt like we touched several times but in my email communications with her, she said she felt lost and at ends trying to reach out to me.  

Today, we were able to get back together.  The concern and pain of separation were washed away by her smile and kiss. I would not say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, but it does make re-uniting sweet and wondrous.  

The idea is to hold the sweetness and feel the wonder all the time.  It can be done, even in a time of pain, even in a time of separation, the memory and the knowledge are there.  And the joy you share in your times together can sustain you for a long long time.

That's what I do."

"event","I sit and consider what to start with.  Nothing in my mind, heart and life can even begin to sum up what I hope to include in this.  I was led to start my LJ by my dearest love, the wondrous Piquantessence.  She is a reason unto herself and she credits me with too much.  She has opened herself and included me in her growth; she has rediscovered herself and allowed me to participate with her exploration. I have discovered and rediscovered things about myself as a result.   Some things I knew, some things I found out and some things I remembered from half-forgotten lessons learned over a lifetime.  

This is the life I live because of it."

I heard a thing on NPR about blogs the other evening, but-  well, haha look at me im rambling again!  It just goes to show that you can't change the past, and the future is built one brick at a time.  I'd like to hear about everyone's winter and autumn some time soon, yes, even you Marge, not even I hold a grudge for that long.

Who's got hiking boots?  I need a pair for a 3d mobile I'm making for my neighbor's newborn infant.  This whole birth rebirth thing makes me remember when I once tortured some guy back in Zaire.  Did you know they're stopping production on Slice orange soda?  God, I feel so old when I think about myself as an infant in Zaire bathing in tubs and tubs of Slice.  The good things in our lives all dissapear.

Well, call me soon.  My phone's always on, and if I'm not there my ferret will answer.  JK, yo.  Krakkakow,,,,>"

"event","At the risk of pointing out the obvious, life and fate sure have a sense of humor and a really messed up way of doing things. It was fun talking to Danielle tonite after so many years, specially cuz I never knew that she was so close by. I miss Zaire, the beautiful autumns when all the leaves turned red at the same time...and the first snow of the season....and running around the tracks behind my house, falling asleep to the sound of the 10.45 train with its endless wagons....going to downtown Oak Park on the bus and hanging out doing anything and everything....umm, the pizza...the old movie theather....that place where they gave out free samples of fresh breaked bread until too many people from my HS forced them to stop doing it :-P......the Windy Country sure has an appeal like no other. Every so often I wonder what my life would have been like if I had stayed there. Our house was awesome, and the neighberhood was pretty cool, not to mention that I actually knew my neighbors over there (in fact, my parents probably still keep in touch with them...). It's such a different dynamic, a more traditional lifestyle I guess while still keeping that nice edge of the city. Two years was just a horrible tease for what seven years could have been....haha, I would have probably been in some Ivy school by now had I kept my school record the way it was going and my plastic surgeon kept that job that he had, specially coming out of my HS....ah, the possibilities that I'll never know about. Still, Danielle got out of there as soon as she could, so I guess either I'm over-romanticising the whole thing or it was cuz she grew up there so she didn't know any different. Still, I can't understand how she would like SF better than Zaire....sorry to all my BA peeps, but it's true, I'll take Zaire any day over SF. So yeah, I'll have to clarify that when I see her next month, make her give me a good reason why she picked it, hehehe."

anyways, now that thats done, I can talk about what happened to me at Border's.  So I'm sittin' around, eatin' a Chocolate-raspberry crumble brownie, with a fork of course, when up walks Girard.  Remember Girard??  Minister of torture at my palace?  I was totally blown away!  So I quickly put an earmark in Governor Jesse Ventura's frank and heartwarming autobiography, ""Ain't Got Time to Bleed"", and offered him a seat.  We talked for literally YEARS!  It was all ""Man you've changed""  ""Oh yeah, well you know, it's the new Juicer I bought, it brings the color out and all the juice takes off a few pounds!"", ya know, back and forth stuff.  So just as he's gettin' up to go back from whence he came, what do I notice sticking to his shoe??????  A Finger!! A human finger!!!    WOW!!!!!!"

"event","Hi all.  I'm writing to you from Israel right now, where, as they say, a cup of tea in one hand and a red hot poker in the other.  Ha, well, the sun is hot here, hotter than it is in the States or Zaire.  But in Zaire, I had two little guys who walked around and fanned me, so I'm just assuming it was hot.  Why else would they be fanning me? (Fonz, you know what I'm saying lol).

Yesterday I bought a cool coffee mug that says ""Nothing left in my right brain, nothing right in my left brain"".  Just a little something to make me laugh or cheer me up on a cold morning, I think it's pretty cute.  And it's got a little picture of a woman who looks totally baffled and stressed out by life, kind of like how I feel sometimes.

"event","So I went on a huge drug binge on Saturday night with Patrick and Stewl.  You should have seen us.  I had the best time of my life.  We were driving around, when suddenly I had this idea.  I thought we were extremely unsafe and unprotected from the Women of the Night, so I drove us down to the junkyard and we made a force field around the car made out of tires and plastic pieces and old license plates and tapes from bands no one knows.  Except this one, ACDC.  I've heard of them.  And there were a couple old maps and plastic bags in the forcefield.  So anyhow, still COMPLETELY high on drugs, but feeling much more secure, we took our moving fortress to Denny's.  Except we didn't make it to Denny's, because I couldn't see out of the car and we crashed into a snow-making machine.  So we left the car there, and decided we'd WALK to white castle if we had to.  Because by God.  By God, We were going to eat White Castle before the night was through, come what may."

"event","I used to sit and look out my window and wonder what would happen to the rest of my life. Indeed what could happen in those mystical years in Zaire? The morning air used to make me feel so powerful, even with my PJs still on and a cup of coffee (sometimes a bagel or a donut too) in my hand. People looked so small from the palace and I wondered if there could be anything beyond dictatorship. I mean, you work so hard to get to the top, but once youre there you just miss the struggle, y'know? I've always had mixed feelings about what happened, generally I've always considered it a fuck up, but lately, I don't even know. My new friend Rob tells me that Life is an adventure. God. Sitting there last night was like a moment of complete and utter truth. I would change nothing. The two of us, just out of the center, amongst all those animals, and the popsicles, and ah. It was beautiful. I looked over to Rob, he was petting giggles, the lemur, and I said ""What's next?"" and he replied with a mere ""Who knows?"". Who knows is right. Its a new world out there. A beautiful one. And I am so ready to kick that kid that called me dud's ass.

I mean, Lloyd had been telling me for a while about this one program down at the adult center near where I live or you live, if you are my neighbor Ray, so anyways i went down and signed up and we had the introductory meeting.  The first guy I met was named Sneeze and he was wearing this giant suit made out of I don't know what and he asked me ""why"" was I wearing so much leopard?

"event","I may have stumbled upon a novel idea. Last night I was bored and I wanted to make a blue green type 2 deck(to get a leg up on the next set) So i pulled together some blue cards and some green cards that I had; any blue/green would do. So I culled the herd and played Lee today (monday) and after one great game and terrible defeat the next, I made some revisions, the playtesting allowed me to see what the deck did, I have playtested it a couple times and It's pretty decent, If anyone has suggestions I would appreciate it.

10 forest
10 island

4 compulsive research
4 remand
4 drowned rusalka
4 surveiling sprite
4 repeal

4 birds of paradise
4 wild cantor
4 wild size
3 gleancrawler
3 golgari grave-troll
2 vinelasher kudzu

through a combination remand repeal vinelasher wildsize I have a bit of control the first couple turns, with all the cantrips I can consistently bring out gleancrawler with drowned rusalka and sprite on the field or following shortly after turn 5, that's when i sack sprites to rusalka draw 2 discard one, then have them come back at end of turn if cantor is out it is a free source of mana on my turn, gleancrawler whacks them until an 8/8 or better troll finishes the job probably with a wildsize-it has flaws but leyline of lifeforce, priviledged position, primeval light, recollect, leyline of singularity, etc would be good sideboard material"

"event","I was thinking of how the world is, and I was dismayed to realize how unfair it is. It is luck that we are born where we are, good luck or bad luck. We should do more levelling of the proverbial playing ground. We should not be wasteful in doing so though. We should expect the best, but be kind to those not up to it. We must invigorate ourselves with pride in who we are, in the continuation of knowledge in all its forms. We must look to eachother as fellow human beings, respecting eachother's standards of behavior. We shall come soon to a peak in our evolutionary development, will this peak be the best that man can do, or will man make it a hill compared to his future? Time won't tell us now, we will have to wait. I am an optimist and expect mankind to survive and prosper, as it has in the past. But I do not deny Mr. Hume having fault with my logic, because it is flawed, one who says the sun will rise tomorrow, does so only because it it always has; but that doesn't imply it won't. Racism is dumb. There are people who refuse to give up on living a stereotype, and they often impose it on others,  using peer pressure to reach ""consensus"". This is what racism is ""proved"" by, it's stupid. We need to be individuals, I do not apologize because I play Magic. I embrace it. If that makes me a dork, then I'm a dork. I don't care, I like what I like, I'm an individual. Fuck It."

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

<center><strong>Rational (NT)</strong></center>

You are both logical and creative. You are full of ideas.
You are so rational that you analyze everything. This drives people a little crazy!

Intelligence is important to you. You always like to be around smart people.
In fact, you're often a little short with people who don't impress you mentally.

You seem distant to some - but it's usually because you're deep in thought.
Those who understand you best are fellow Rationals.

In love, you tend to approach things with logic. You seek a compatible mate - who is also very intelligent.

At work, you tend to gravitate toward idea building careers - like programming, medicine, or academia.

With others, you are very honest and direct. People often can't take your criticism well.

As far as your looks go, you're coasting on what you were born with. You think fashion is silly.

On weekends, you spend most of your time thinking, experimenting with new ideas, or learning new things.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/threequestionpersonalitytest/"">The Three Question Personality Test</a></div>"

Mild mannered and laid back, you take life at a slow pace.
You are very consistent - both in emotions and actions.
You tend to absorb set backs easily. You are cool and collected. 

It is difficult to offend you. You can remain composed and unemotional.
You are a great friend and lover. You don't demand much of others.
While you are quiet, you have a subtle wit that your friends know well.

At your worst, you are lazy and unwilling to work at anything.
You often get stuck in a rut, without aspirations or dreams.
You can get too dependent on others, setting yourself up for abandonment.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whattempermentareyouquiz/"">What Temperment Are You?</a></div>"

intelligence is (according to me and my test). You think it's important

of others, and look for people who you can learn from as well as teach.
You don't fall into the trap of scholar/professor worship, and you're
into other things in life, like nature, athletics, movies, and music.

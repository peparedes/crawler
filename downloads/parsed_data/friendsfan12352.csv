"event","Cutting. Is it to release stress? Really? Wouldn't seem like that it would put more stress on you? The bleeding. What's the point? Do people just do it to get attention? Or does it really make you feel better about yourself? No. People do it because they are depressed. Most the time. Maybe not. I know a few people who have cut or tried or cut before but not anymore. None of them seem like they should. Do they all do it for the attention? How come the people who are really depressed never cut. Wait no. Sometimes...

I can't stand my life anymore. My parents are fighting 2 much. Not only with each other but with me and Ethan. Even my cats fight. Are we a fighting family? I just wish sometimes...my...life was over. I was gone from Hell and into Heaven. I'm so diffrent now. Is it because of school or maybe my family life? Maybe even my social life. Its just...I...no I can't say. No one understands. They never do. Never.

For some reason we got on the topic of cutting today. Pam, Lauren c, and I. I said to Pamela that its not like you had a reason to cut. She said to me ""yah I did"" that made me pissed. Her life is just about perfect. Just about. At least her family life. Jessica Rekay (how ever you spell it) asked pam if she was healing. Pam said no. And than she showed her scar to her. That made me even more pissed than I already was."

<P>Pamela was SUCH a bitch today. We went by one of her bus friends today and shes like wait I have to talk to Erika so I'm like okay whatever and she talked to her and I was waiting there for a million hours bored. Pamela was like to her friend ""omg I just love john so much blah blah blah and I want to go and flirt with him and all this other crap..."" Then pam asks Erika ""come with me to see John"" and her friend was like I don't want to come with you because I don't feel like it or whatever she said and than shes like to pamela ask you friend to go with you and pamela is like ""no...she dosen't want to come"" so I'm like okay...I didn't say that but whatever. Finally I said to her because I knew her friend didn't want to come ""I'll go with you pamela..."" and than she says to me ""you're too short... no offense"" so I waited 5 minutes and said I was going to go and left. Her friend was just as tall as me and she says I'm too short? Lily told me that she always acts like that around older people and I realized that was true/</P> I'm not mad because she called me short, but I'm mad because she was saying that I wasen't good enough for her.
<P>She just called up and shes like why are you mad at me? and I said various reasons... and than shes like well can you do something for me and I'm like what and shes like look someone up in the directory and I said no and shes like bye and a I just hung up. She has the nerve to ask me to do something for her? What a bastard.</P>"

I use to get pretty good grades... but no... all of a sudden I have to get a C in math. I haven't gotten a C since 4th grade in SOCIAL STUIDES. NOT MATH. This is one reason why I don't like Pine View anymore. You know what? Before my brother went to Pine View, he was a nice social little boy...But then he went to third grade... *sigh* But the weridest part that on my fcats, I always get really high. I'm like gifted in 7th grade math but 8th grade math is too hard. So I'm like... A-7. lol. I'm in between it... *sigh*

Some people were like you don't really look that werid and I'm like wtf? How many people you see dress like this? lol. Lauren C. was to shy to dress werid, she thought people would call her a poser, which makes absolutely no sence AT ALL. 
I had a test everyday but Monday this week. It was so horrible. I was like so over-stressing. My mom is like ""So, how was school, how were your tests, would you like to move to North Carolina?"" lol. It was like so random. My family are like random people. Its so strange. lol. I mean my cats are even random. lol. 
I've been talking to Dakota on AIM, but then we liked stopped. I told her some secrets and we had fun. lol. And then she like left me. Boo hoo...lol. My dad just came home. Yay I guess.
Life has been treating me tuff. I have huge bags under my eyes from staying up late. I like almost fell asleep during my french test on Thursday. So I learned its better to get sleep...lol. I don't think I've cried in to long, but I'm over sencitave. I'm NOT OVERSENCATIVE. Who could say such a thing???? lol sorry it was random. Well I'm going to leave now because I'm bored I guess.

I was like browsing the internet today and I saw a pic of him and I just sat there looking at him for 6 min. And then I realized to stop. Hes so beautiful...And hes like only 3 years older then more or something! lol. But hes like 5'9...too tall for me! lol. I'm in loooooovvvveeee. *sigh* I want him. lol. I'm so pathetic. Once, I had a dream about him. It was the best dream I have ever had (yes, sad). Like I saw him and like everything was yellow for some strange reason. And I was wearing my yellow Theater Fest t-shirt and he was just wearing a yellow shirt. And like he came up to me and said hey. And I say hi, and then he picked me up in his arms (like you know how grooms do to their bride) and he kissed me. and then we like floated away...It was so beautiful...lol. And when I was putting my pimple cream on a few minutes ago, I started thinking about him while I was sqeezing the tube and then when I came back to earth, all this cream was coming out. hehe. Well I just thought I should tell everyone I am very pathetic, so see ya!"

Don't mind my other entry, I kind of overreacted. I was just mad... And I'm glad to know that more people commented on my other entry. Yesterday, I tried to changed the colors to light blue and light colors, and I made the colors werid so it got totally screwed and I'm to lazy to make them diffrent and I also forget the old colors...SO Roni said she would fix the colors...NEXT WEEK! Oh well, I don't really care, I will probably change it sooner or later...Today at school was boring. Maureen and Noelle noticed I got new shoes. :) How nice, they pay attention. But I got at school at nine and I saw lauren campbell and so I hanged out with her. And than I also hanged out with her at lunch. Roni keeps on saying I hate her, but I don't! I mean, how can anyone hate Roni...So I drove home and my dad picked me up early from school today which is very suprising...I've been in such a tired mood today because today was long and I got to bed late last night... Really late, so I decided right after I type this entry, I'm going to do my homework! And then at 8:00, I'm going to take a shower! And so I'm going to try to go to bed at 10! But it takes me forever to go to sleep and I'm not use to going to bed that early. Anyways, I've realized I'm more of a back up friend for people, I'm only going to give one example but like yesterday, Pam called me and she told me that she called Lily W. first, but she wasen't home so she called me. Than Chelsea called and so she tells me she has to go because she decided to talk to Chelsea instead of me! How rude! Oh well. If anyone wants to help me, please post on the comments good colors that I could put in my journal so I don't have to have my werid colors right now.

I just read the entry and I like kept on changing to diffrent topics...I'm werid."

"event","Dear Journal,
I'm going to write to you like your a jounral because there is no point of writing to you like people are reading this because people don't care. My parents are so mean to me. I mean, Its two days after my birthday and they treat me like crap. I wanted to go to the mall to buy myself new sneakers at the beginning of the summer and I was waiting for the perfect time when I got money for my birthday. And my mom is like ""oh sure whatever"" Yesterday I got mad beacause my mom ate my chocolate that Carolina gave to me for my birthday. That made me so pissed because I like to eat junk food when I am upset and so I went to the fridge and I couldn't find my chocoalte so I started to freak out. I'm like ""WHO ATE MY CHOCOALTE"" And than I started to cry because someone ate my chocolate which is really pathetic. So I decided to be mean to my mom. So I yell at my mom for eating my birthday chocoalte. And shes like, WELL YOU SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE GIVING. And I said to her WELL THAN I'LL GIVE YOU SOME BEFORE YOU TAKE. And so I ran to my room and I didn't no what to do because I didn't want to come out. So I went on AIM and no one was on. So I was bored to death. Than she comes into my room screaming IM NOT TAKING YOU ANYWHERE YOU LITTLE BRAT. YOUR SPOILED AND IM NOT TAKING YOU ANYWHERE. AND CLEAN YOUR ROOM. (because my room is a mess)And she said all this crap. And so I'm like OKAY GET OUT. And shes like NO THIS IS MY HOUSE. And so I scream THIS IS MY ROOM. and so I push her out of my room and even though my mom is small, she works out so she is super strong so she pushes her was back in and than I have a wall to support me so I pushed my back on the door and my feet on the wall. So she went out. And than I like hear these loud roaring stomps outsite of my room and I was typing to you. Since I'm not allowed to be typing to you journal, I had to X out of this box thing quick. Than she storms in and is like ""I WANT THIS DOOR OPEN YOU HEAR"" And I was closing it on her because I was to mad to listen to her and I didn't want her to come in so I screamed ""IM CHANGING GET OUT"" So that worked and I put my little desk thing in front of the door because my dad took of the lock so Its harder to get in. And than after like 30 min I hear the dreadful deadly stomping and She trys to push her way in but its hard because of the desk thing infront of the door. And she screams ""MOVE YOUR FURNITURE BACK YOU BRAT"" And she left and never came back which was realiving. So after awhile of thinking on the ground, I cried my self asleep at around 12. Than I woke up and ate HORRIBLE microwave pancakes because my parents went somewher (prob. buying my stupid brother his new computer) Than the finally came home and my mom was. omg, my mom just came in and said my dad would take me to the mall. Wow, that was really unexpected...I guess I'm going to go now. I guess my parents decided they put me through enough. :)"

Mainly because I am. But also, my parents really aren't the richest people in the world so I don't get alot of presents, but I really dont mind. My mom this morning gave me ten dollars which made me mad because I don't want their money so I gave $5 back. Great gift taker eh? lol. So on... I didn't like this morning because I started to cry because it was birthday. I am such a loser. :p I hate the mornings, worst time...But I like them when its the summer and it's the morning. But that is because you get to relax... Anyways, my mom got me a backpack that I have had my eye on since the beginning of the summer but I didn't really want it because it was small. So I'm just going to either use it next year or in the middle of the year. Tomarrow hopefully I am going shopping to get new sneakers...FINALLY! My grandpa and aunt and uncle each give me $50 so I've been waiting for that. And then with like all the extra $20 I'm going to get some other clothes. To conclude, Birthdays sucks and thats what I agree on."

So that's cool I guess. What classes did you pick if I didn't mention you? Well anyway. I think I noticed I'm like teh only one that reads my live journal. So if I think about it I'm talking to myself... Interesting. Oh well. I don't care. But I realized something strange. In like 20 years or so, our technology will be so advanced that people will start trying to take over the world. So it will be like evil villians flying over Sarasota. So then we will have like superheros too. It sounds werid, but its going to happen...You know, I don't believe in History. Like in the book we have to read, they changed history.

"event","Okay, I really haven't wrote in this thing for a frickin long time. But I've been soo busy latley, and my stupid computer hasen't been working. Plus, I went on a mini vacation which I didn't have the internet there. I think I have lost my touch typing really fast. I mean I leave my computer for like two weeks so it breaks and my fingers get screwed up. Its like something is trying to tell me something? Who knows. I went to my house in North Carolina. It was frickin cold. But weridly, every night I was like writing in my live journal in my head. Like what I would write in my lj if I had internet connection. When I went to NC, I had the craziest dreams. I dreamnt that I found the perfect guy. It was really strange. Like he had like brown hair and he was short like me. He was so fun to be around. We like started talking and blah blah. But weridly we were on the show Rosanne. I have absoulty no idea why. But if any of you have watched it, Rosanne's husband was like spanking a child and like they had the recorded laughing and he was like making a joke. But anyways, all of I sudden I can't remember it. Okay this is werid. I have been having a loss of memory latley. I think its because I banged my head in my faucite bathroom...lol. Okay I guess I will talk about camp now. When I came back, my camp had started making up their dances and singing the songs so I had no idea about anything. It was really annoying. So I had to learn the dance in 5 days learn about 10 songs. It's actually really hard. And I dont even completly know the songs. My life and memory is screwing me up. Gosh I hate this. Okay before I go crazy I'm going to go talk to my uncle now. Bye."

Anyway, camp is fun. I enjoy it! I might actually be able to go to Maureen's party! But, I might not be able to go to Dakota's. :(.

"event","Parents are so complicated. They just don't understand children, well at least me. They just want to make me mad. Its not fair. Some people think that they have bad lives. Well, its not true. I think I have an okay life, just my parents make it bad. Sometimes they can be really nice. But sometimes they just want to make me run away. They force me to do things that I DO NOT want to do. I mean my brother does this one thing, so they think that I have to do it too. I am definatly NOT like my brother, as alot of you know. My brother is way smarter than my and he is capable of doing things that I really can't do. There really is nothing wrong about that, but my parents think that I should be just as well, if not better. But its hard having my life. But I do appreciate that my parents are getting me braces, that I have a decent home, food in my fridge, and other stuff like that. They do care about me but they just don't understand me. But I don't like sharing stuff with them, which helps cause my problem. I just need to share with something, and my livejournal is it. I rather type something instead of talking. 
Up to date on other things:
Me and Pamela are friends again. We made up the next day. Typical of best friends. But I am happy. I started camp today. It was interesting. We had a harsh gay dance teacher. It was so funny because you could so tell that he was gay. If any of you people saw 'Singing in the Rain', well he did that little jump with the clicking with his feet. It was so funny and cool. Tomarrow I get my spacers. I herd from some people that they hurt so bad. Other people, I hear that there is nothing wrong. Good advice...lol. I might not be able to go to Maureen's birthday party. Which really sucks, because I like Maureen and her party last year was fun. I might have to take a ""Vacation"" to North Carolina. Gross...lol.. Well, not really but oh well. Pamela is over. She had no idea what I'm typing. She is busy knotting my hair, a.k.a.- 'doing'. She is going to be staying with me for 3 days. Her parents are away. Its funny, casue she just started reading what I was typing and shes like ukylr865g98pr685r7t---that was her, doing! lol.  Okay I think that is enough. Bye. Please leave comments if you would like to cheer me up. Thanks."

Like, all the friends I ever made and the school I have gone to, and the camp I've gone to for like the last 3 years, will all be gone. I'm going to have a whole new life. But, its not my choice. Anyways, the house in NC is cheaper than my house here and my family don't really have a whole chunk of cash...I'm going to miss my best friends. :( But, when I move there in 8th grade, I'm going to tell everyone to call me Brittany. Its not like someone is actually going to know me thats from FL. Also, when I went there in 5th grade, it was so frickin cold. And it was the summer! I was shivering like crazy. I'm to use to the warmness here! Well, I don't know what else to say, because there is like nothing. Cya people."

I needed to do it before I went crazy, I couldnt wait till monday.I was sick yesterday night and this morning. it wasen't cool. and my brother was being mean to me. :( oh well.

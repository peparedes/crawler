"event","i can't believe this is happening!

it feels like just yesterday that i arrived in manchester international airport in england...
now i'm going home!

i'm taking a cab to the train station in less than 4 hours...
where i will get to manchester international airport and then leave for atlanta, where i'll leave for norfolk, and home for the first time since january.

do i like it?  i don't know...
i've come to like england... i loved it here, and i really wished that i had been here for the whole year.
i've never lived in dorms before, so this is naturally a new thing for me... and i loved it.

i felt homesick all of ONCE then i didn't feel it again.
i love it... but my mom needs me.  she needs me to help her out, and i cannot avoid it any longer.
i have to go back home where i must face all of my troubles once more and figure out everything including graduation, law school applications, and so on...

i have hope though... that even if i do return home, i'll be fine.  i think this is going to be an okay year for me...
and i'll soon have my year... so i'm not worried...

i'm so going to miss england and ireland and all though...

next year, i'm going to save as much money as possible and try to come back. ;)

i love europe."

"event","so... my easter vacation has officially started!  i know... i should be prepping for the LSAT's and the final exams that i will be taking once i return to the states and the UK, respectively... so where am I?  guess!!!

this country is located in the ""far east"" region of the world.  in the economic sense, it is one of the ""four dragons"", a developing nation but with a very high GDP/GNP and a high standard of living.  The natives call the land ""Dae-Han-Min-Guk"" and the capital of this country (where I am currently living in) is Seoul.  Guess... if you can't... i will think you were retarded.

So... i'm in... ROK, Republic of Korea or... South Korea!  Woo hoo!!!

The sun is finally shining, and it feels great to know that hey~ the sun does shine in Korea as well~!!!
my family is awesome.  i love all the relatives (except for their innate criticism on my fatness) and stuff... and i think it's really really sweet to be here for the first time in 9 years... yes, it's been 9 years since my last entrance into this country... ^___^

well... for one thing, all the signs are in korean, chinese (mandarin), and english... well, not all the signs, just the major road signs... although i highly doubt a non-korean speaker would drive in Korea without a single knowledge of the Korean language (cuz that's just plain disrespectful)... 

but that aside...

it's the 2nd of april, and my mum'll be here in three days!  i am soooo excited, it's not even funny!!!!!!!  until she arrives, i reckon i'll just be chillin' around my aunt's house...eating, watching tv or surfing online... there really isn't much to do anyways... especially since school's on break!!!  woo hoo~ imma eat tons of korean snacks (truly, korean snack's awesome!!!), and stuff!!!

i feel very blonde at the moment as i type this.. but i can't help it.. i'm in KOREA~~  hollah back! woo!"

"event","so... i did nothing.  i went to sleep... turned the alarm clock off around 11 AM and went back to sleep... woke up in between with a very dry mouth, i must remember, and i simply was really... pained and sick... yeah... tons of cold sweat and all that... yeah... not fun.
woke up around 4 PM... thought it was only around 2 PM... so i was like, ""okay, let me go into town now..."" then realised when i turned the computer on that ""hey!"" it was way too late to go into town!

grr... 0_0;;
i went downstairs, fixed me pasta and garlic bread... yeah, and came upstairs... jae made me a cup of tea and erin brought a movie, ""ladder 49"" and man... that movie was just really really sad!!!  i cried at the end (seeing that i normally don't cry watching movies, i think i'm going soft.. -_-+) too many romantics around me these days... making me more like a human... hm... 0_0;;;

so apparently, my mom might not get to korea until the 4th of april... which means i'll be in korea by myself (well... with relatives but still!!!) for five days at least... and it'll be me waiting for her at the incheon international airport... bloody hell.. this is gonna be a ton of fun... -_-+++
argh.

anyhoo's...
i guess i'll have to wait until monday before i go into newcastle to get my camera fixed, get espresso beans, and stuff... ^___^;;; ah... times goes way too quick when you're having fun... -_-+ i'm gonna dread, no, detest going back to the states... i don't know if i'll survive!!!!!!  T___T; i love it here too much.

so... on ladder 49, jack morrison had a claddagh ring too... and he turned it around where his heart was facing toward him... i thought it was the sweetest thing... then when they got married, his ring was on his left hand!  i stared at my ring, and i was vewy vewy happy that i had one too~!!!  that's what i'll do when i meet my mr. right! ^___^  hee hee... i might get a new ring though... like a prettier one with jewels (even if they're not necessarily real) on it... just cuz, i'm a female and i like things that glitter~! LOL.

anyhoo... gonna go hang with the gang... so cheers~~!"

"event","well... it's actually... 2:20 AM on saturday morning... the second to the last week of march, with one more paper left (the hardest one of international minority rights), and everything to be done before leaving for korea on the 30th of march (arriving on 31st of march).  

so... quite excited?  just maybe... yeah.  slightly worried that me mum might not meet me at ICN when i arrive?  just a bit.  after all, i doubt my relatives could take a better care of me than my mum, and of course, i would have chosen to go on the contiki tour with jaela and erin if my mum wasn't going to korea as well...

korea, i haven't been there in nine years... i'm so not sure if i'll like it... everything would have changed; not to mention; i am quite plump for the korean standards (looking at all these chinese people in my dorm block, you wonder how they stay like a stick without starving themselves, really... is it the food?) but anyways... i hope no one tries to force me to lose weight there; cuz i'll gain more back, knowing me. i remember last year, when these lads suddenly took more interest in me (they're not exactly my type), and from what it was, shock, maybe? i gained most of my weight back.  so my goal is to lose about 35 pounds before next year; will it be possible? maybe; after all, i do not want to graduate college and feel as fat as i did when i graduated high school.  it has to be done properly this time; with pictures and people and everything.

it doesn't help very much that my throat is very hoarse and sore; i can't swallow without grimacing, and it doesn't help that i have to scream sometimes.  i think i might be down with a cold or something related to sinus and all... it's quite disgusting, all the mucus, i mean.

i'm currently listening to di.fm eurodance... DJ Skott's mix.
trying to unwind because i'll have a bit of work to do tomorrow; jaela was throwing me her camera and accidentally dropped it, which impacted the lense and it's not going in properly now... i have no clue how much it'll cost, but i'll have to get it fixed, ASAP especially since i have to go to korea next week...

i definitely kept my calm; if i had freaked out, someone would have cried; most likey jaela.  she looked like she was going to; so i acted like... well, my nonchalant face that i'm so used to having practiced.  i'm sure it won't be bad... if it is, we'll figure something out.  life's full of things like this, anyways. that's why we have refurbishing and people who fix stuff like this, although i think with some tools, i could prolly get it fixed; but since i've never done it (yes, i've fixed laptops and all before, but not those small intricate things like the camera... especially now i realise that it might be a lot more difficult once i get into the damn camera... -_-;;; gr... i'll just go find a place where they might have the people who fix things like that... jaela said she'd help me pay for it... so i guess we'll do something like 50/50; hopefully it won't cost too much; i won't be able to afford it... and the camera's way too expensive to just buy... so i guess i'm pretty stuck.

well... that's it for now... i have to go to sleep as i have a full day's work in terms of getting my paper done, or at least get it started, make sure i get the camera fixed, and make sure that i get the proper espresso mix for my cousin.  so, i must bid y'all a farewell, and peace out!

cheers!"

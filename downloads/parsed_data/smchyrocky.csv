There are a lot of losers in a downturn, and a lot of winners.  For some with the comfort and stability of a black suit job the paycheques keep rolling in, but everything gets cheaper.  Huh...I never wanted a Pontiac anyway.  For the rest, and those in the sales industry, everything takes a kicking.  No matter who we want to blame - the insurgents, the government, etc...when it comes down to it it's our own collective idiocy and greed that drives the stake into us.

We're all guilty.  You should feel guilty.  You should feel shame.

What have our forefathers done, what has our country done so that as we come of age we walk into a world that is not ready to accept us.  After years of stripping the beauty from the world, we're left standing in a pool of nostalgia and used hope and expectations that our previous generations have lost for us.

Music is beautiful.  Music is my world.

I can't look at the big picture, because the big picture is seeded with people like those who come to me now, blaming me for the ghost in the machine.

I love the little beauties in life.  I love living every second at a time.  The seconds are joyous.  The tenths of seconds are sensual and erotic.  The times when the world seems to freeze are the times I wish I would never leave.

I hope you go to bed tonight at some point and appreciate what you have, yearn for little and wake up with the willingness to start over.  So many of us (me included) have started over, and are ready to embrace the new way.

Whatever that new way is.

I guess I'm finding peace with life.

There was a time when everything sucked.  I was a prisoner - trapped like a winter gopher in the caves I'd built for myself.  Life was dark and I think everything reflected that.  Things are slow now, but pretty cool.  I'm keeping busy for the most part, so while I'm somewhat bored (curse) I stay out of trouble (good).  

Life was for me a perpetual search for myself and to save my own sanity by finding ways to feel good.  

I have goals right now.  Somewhat unattainable...but they're goals.  

I am always on a quest for good music.  I tend to rarely find it, but instead hop from little islands of entertainment that cause me joy.  I love music.  I REALLY love music.  It stirs my soul, gets me lost, and lets me fantasize.  One thing I thought was tongue-in-cheek good was:

http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=69041220

Her song was kinda catchy, which is lucky considering she walked into 15 minutes.  If I were a record label, I'd publish her one-off record.

I still can't turn away from stuff like <a href=""http://www.within-temptation.com/en/"">Within Temptation</a>.  

I was talking with a friend about who was the best Metal band.  (real metal - thrash metal) and I don't really have an answer.  Here are some thoughts:

Metallica - well, you guys had the potential of a friggin' rocket ship.  Then you turned to suck/commercial, and now are appealing like the backstreet boys.  Your music all sounds the same, and it's certainly no Master of Puppets.

Megadeth - Dave Mustaine is probably a big pain in the ass.  But musically one of the best in the world.  There is no ""perfect"", but if you do straight comparison his beautiful and shredding guitar work, combined with his wry lyrical commentaries make him a leader of pod-people.  I love you Dave.  United Abominations is great (latest album).

Slayer - Awesome, but not mainstream enough to be ""the best"".  They are the best at being Slayer...  Whatever shit anyone says about them is like criticising a shark for not planting flowers.  Just let them be Slayer - fast, hard, and evil.  Just like good sex.

This led to talk about why we are talking about ""the best"" bands, and they were all around in the 80's?

I think it's because in those days kids had a LOT of free time (no intern3t, no ipods, no PSP, no ""guitar hero"") so they could spend 8 hours a day in a band or practicing guitar (Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, Paul Gilbert, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Eddie Van Halen, Glenn Tipton, KK Downing, Jeff Hanneman, Kirk Hammett, etc).  

Now what do we do?  Walk around text messaging, smoke some dope and play Guitar hero.  We've been fucked up for the last 15 years because of internet and easy fun.  What are we good at any more?

I wonder if the weather has been nicer this year back home...hmmm.

I've been thinking about Iraq in random weekly thoughts for the past 6 months or so.  Maybe longer, but nyah, I don't really remember that far back.

""...no civil war has ever been won by an outside force coming in to bring peace to a region...""  If we want them to stop infighting, we need them to fix it themselves.  We will never perform this task for them.  How would you like the French military on OUR soil telling us how to do things?

It'll be hard to see our work disappear, but I really don't think we have a choice.  We CAN'T bring peace to the region (can anyone bring peace to the middle east?  They're a bunch of race & religious bigots out there - everyone fighting because they think God is behind them.  Shi-ite, Sunni, Palestinian, etc...

When we pull out, we're dooming a people and land to perpetual civil war or tyranny, but hey, that's life.  Our only other choice is to become the oppressor and dominate the land...and that wouldn't be acceptable to most of us.

It seems that when the soldiers get mad at the Iraqi's for fighting back (revolution?), it's alright to blow them asunder.  It becomes personal - ""that fucker just shot at me"", and like the great hand of God we and our almighty war machines wreak furious vengeance.  Vengeance that feels justified.

Terrorism is one thing - but to invade someones land then get annoyed when they shoot back - that's kind of a hypocrisy.

I like our military.  I think it should be the best in the world, and should be feared like the little kid in ""The Grudge"".  But let's not invade anyone half-heartedly and pretend we're going to make everyone love us.  Why don't we stay off other people's land.  Forever.  Stop the meddling.  Who's next - Iran?  Canada?  France?  Vietnam again?

If it were up to me, I'd a ho.  Give me an M4 and I'll fix everything.

The next toy is right behind it on the line.  It doesn't really matter what happened or happens to the first toy - it is discardable, and not worth remembering.

  Like the fair flower dishevell'd in the wind;
    Riches have wings, and grandeur is a dream;
      The man we celebrate must find a tomb,
        And we that worship him, ignoble graves.
      - William Cowper, Task (bk. III, l. 261) 


You know that feeling you get when you're sitting on a bus, really tired, and watching life and people flash by at 30 miles an hour?  It's a slow, lonely death.

Minutes tick by - hours tick by.  You miss your stop.  You daydream.  You think and wonder about stuff.  I use that time to defrag my overly-active brain.  I wonder about bigger-than-simple things.  It's not the buttons of life, or the shoe-dirt that fascinates me.  It's the careers, relationships, loves and laughs that people have and take for granted.  I see people arguing.  I see people sitting in cars alone at stoplights, wiping tears from their eyes, as they desperately try to get home (or away from home) to resolve some terrifying issue.  

That's my life.  I'm peering through a fisheye lens, and everything seems to happen superquick.  I don't feel alone - I'm not.  But I'm separate.  All the other alone people are in their own fishbowl-lives, looking through there peepholes at the other people running along the hallways having fun.  We're the outsiders.  Self-sealed into our own tombs from inside the soul of society.

I never knew what I wanted until it was too late.
I never knew what to dream about until my dreams were taken away.
I took for granted all I had.  Then when all I had was gone, I was left 
to savor the little crumbs that were left.
Life is a dead, heartless mass while we live it.
It turns in a swirling, visceral beast when we are shut out.

That one day I would own a house on this street, that the neighbors would all be the same, and maybe I would one day be a Mom like all the others.  The world was a microcosm there.  It had houses, jobs, people, friends, animals, weather, hope and despair.  I played that world - and loved it.  My dolls made life, my dirt created visions, and my rocks crushed the entities I created.

I'm stuck in the middle now, and it's a rough place to be.  Lost in the spotless sterility of youth everything seems perfect.  Every day is pretty good, because there's really nothing to do but play and dream.

With age comes both wisdom and the acceptance that you and yours are completely, entirely dominated and controlled.  You had better like it, or grow to live comfortably in your place.  Not too many suburban elders ""fight for their right"" or question things.

They live on old morals, old values, and old stories.

An old man once told me a story in a barbershop.  He was a grizzly veteran, probably about 75 years old and full of the look and stench of his time.  He explained to me how things are the way they are because he helped fight to save our land from the Germans.  I remember having this feeling of almost disbelief, because he was so adamant, old, and crazy.  The more vehament the arguement, the more stubbornly our minds fight back I think.  I love and appreciate what they did, but it feels like a numb callous for me.  I have trouble feeling or connecting with it.  I have trouble changing, because I live for the moment and not for the past or future.

I don't see life, or the war as having much real moral value for me.  It's like investing in barren land, or taking a 100 week course in blinking.  A waste of time.

I want to feel good about the world.  I want to feel like we're climbing up a hill as a team, and that we're all worthwhile, we're all important, and that we're going to get somewhere fantastic.

It seems that all of us know the inevitable though.  The encroaching darkness of time, the expanding grip of America and China and the Oil that runs through our veins.  Our war against hate is spilling against us like a virus, breeding new generations of Martyrs that having nothing more joyous in their life to do than to take us out.  Within 20 years, it'll be instinctive to their DNA...

We're going to hell, and all I want is a taco.  Please save us.

As each day goes by I get more and more disenchanted with the world.  We're just a huge shell of shit that's enveloped everything and pretty much everything is fake.

I certainly can't fix it - and I'm not going to try.  I guess being true to myself and taking small steps..."

"event","It's so hot here, for so long.  I think the weather sucked back home, but I think it kinda sucks here too.

I think it will take me years to figure out life.  I just get the feeling we're all little tiny ants in a large glass bowl.  Although I really don't give a shit, I wonder about the war, about the stories about corporations, about us that have to work, and where the real money goes.  I am not going to waste my time pursuing or questioning...but in my free time I wonder about the things I can't answer.

I don't think there are any conspiracies out there.  I think the world is just the way it is.  But I think we do have a class system, it's just kinda like we're meant to think that we're all equal when some are just more equal than others. ^_^

No matter what life I'm shoehorned into I'm still having trouble with my mood.  I don't think this is something I can change.  Medications work, but I am not sure if they are the best answer.  It's like fixing up a shitty car - if you look at it from the outside, although you can make it run it's still a shitty car.

At least it's easy to get bud now and then.  That's one of the only things out there that makes me feel good.  And my other addiction... ^_^

I miss movie and Halo nights.  I need to turn the page."

"event","Thank you <lj user=""dezin_devka""> btw.

Things have been pretty quiet lately.  I'm becoming accustomed to a slower, different life.

Music, TV, movies all take up a majority of my time.  I think I'm too smart to sit idle, and too broke to go adventuring.  What I'd give for a few friends and a road trip.  It's what I longed for before...it's what I long for now.

Everything seems a shit, so I guess I just need to build my own castle, build my own walls and start from the simple bottom.

I have time, so I'm going to try to solve this:

I'm feeling alright - kind of a mixture between happy cruising and lonely abyss.  The perpetual motion of my mind has slowed down a little bit, so I'm more taking things one day at a time and enjoying what I can each day.

I've been trying to watch TV lately but things are sort of slow - I almost look forward to the fall and seeing the new shows that will come out.

I've found two movies that have grabbed my eye - Donnie Darko and Fight Club.  (yes, I've been going through old DVD's)

Why aren't there more movies out there that make us think a little more?  Does everything have to be a Shrek or a Norbit?  

Maybe I'm drawn more to psychological thrillers rather than bland comedies that I forget the next day.  I want to be hit by a movie.

My DVD player has been acting up lately.  I want to smash it.  It seems to skip at the most interesting parts, which then involves a long procedure of cleaning, hitting, and praying to the God and Goddess.  So far it's worked."

Taking everything for granted is human nature.  Noone put it there, there is no grand scheme, everything just is.

"event","I have been wondering more about the meaning of life lately.

It seems to me like we're living in a big Amway scam, and everything is either shallowly contrived or some sort of conspiracy.

We've gone to Iraq to kick some ass and give them democracy, but it seems to me that:

- Even they hate each other and will forever fight and kill each other in a civil war.  Did you see on the news how they STONED a woman to death for dating a man of the wrong religion (""wrong"" being wrong in their own country.  Shiite vs Sunni?)  They're screwed no matter WHAT we do.  So I don't really have an opinion.  If we stay or leave it doesn't really matter.  It's always good to give our military target practice though in the event of a real war.

- By the time I get a real car that can actually go fast, gas will be $200 a gallon and we won't be allowed anything beyond electric cars and mopeds.  Someone's making a lot of money there.

Virginia Tech.  Ya, it sucked, but given the number of people around it's a pretty small percentage.  Sorry, get over it, and don't give aliens guns.  One time a kid at our school made a killing list that said how many times he was going to shoot each person. This kid saved it on a school computer, which got his ass nailed.  Stuff like this is inevitable, given we're growing towards the size of China. 

Movies have been really sucky lately.  I haven't heard of or seen a good one in months.  I've been mainly watching TV and older DVD's."

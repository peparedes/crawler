And my dad doesnt even see it, and that really bothers me, i mean how can you not see it when he&nbsp; does it everysingle day. oh yea and i got kicked outta school on friday cuz of derrick mother fuckin hasse, that lil pussy fuckin called me a bitch, so i hit him in teh face and the lil pussy took it to Mr. Schmidt!! yea hes fuckin dumb as hell and so immature and it pisses me off how ppl that are older then me can be so much more immature then me!! lol yea derrick that you, ya fuckin PUSSY!!!and , so when my dad got home form teh store , i told him right away that i got kicked out so i couldnt go to school on monday, and all he told em was to ""NOT WORRY BOUT IT""! so i said ok i wont then if u dont care why should i, ya know!!so then monday morning comes around and he comes in my room at about 7 am and wakews me up and says its time for school!! i was like dad i told you that i got kicked out and u told em to not worry bout it, so i didnt! he goes well shit i thought u were kidding!! i was like yea fuckin right! so he was like well im just gonna tell lisa that ur sick. so he fuckin goes and tells her that i got kicked out!! then shit fuckiun hit the fan! ""she got kicked outta school and you let her do what ever the fuck eh wanted to do all weekend?""-lisa! i was so fuckin pissed at ehr omg i could of screamed right there!! like he has to tell lisa sumthin different just so he cna save his own ass from lisa gettin pissed off at him, but instead he rather have lisa pissed off at me! and i dont care what lisa&nbsp; fuckin said to me the otehr day, im not goin to new york with them! yea i wanna go to be wiht my dad, but im not goin cuz i dont know if i can stand EVERYONE i n a car for 18 hours !! i would prolly fuckin go crazy! and my dads makin me feel reall guilty for not wantin to go but i dont care, i seriously dont wanna go with them! if it was just me me dad and brittani i would deffinatly go but its not so of course im not gunna go!! so if they have a problme wiht it they can , cuz i wont go wiht them!!</FONT></P>

Well its not that bad cuz gaeya and brittani are grounded too!! lol!But only till we bring our grades up and it wont be that hard! So yea we got to go out with  mike and rico just for last night!! But starting today we are all grounded!! HeHe! Well so today me and gaeya wanted to see if we wre grounded from EVERYTHING or just from goin places!! So we asked if we could have rico and mike over to watch a movie and they cant even come over!! im so pissed cuz i really wanted to hang out with them! UGH!! Well so while we are sittin here, were not doin a DAMN thing all day!! And i tried to tell my dad about one the grades and he wouldnt listen, and it fuckin pisses me off how he never listens to any thing i say to him ! or he just acts like hes listen in but hes really not and that pisses me off even more!! UGH!! Well i guess i cant talk cuz im in a good mood for now but later i might be gettin pissed off again cuz BRITTANI will be home and i absolutly do NOT get a long wiht her as of this very day!! We cant even look at each other with out being bitches to each other!! Now thast sad!! Well she says its only cuz of RICO, when thast not even why we dont get along! Its cuz o fher dumb asss boy friend that wont even look at me cuz im really good friends with rico and he wants to fight him but rico wont cuz rico dont wanan fight unless he absolutly has to and they are all sayin that its cuz hes a fuckin pussy and thats not even teh reason! SO i think that if they are gunna sit there and fuckin threatin to kick ricos ass then dont just sit there accutally do it instead of just talkin shit all teh fuckin time!! Now im not sayin for them to go and do it, but they hjave been sayin that they are gunna kick his ass seence LAST year and guess what, ...........They still havent done a damn thing to him ,so i guess there not gunna !! But i got to go so ill ttyl kk byes

"event","Hey everyone, just sittin her being board as hell! i just got home form being wiht Rico and Mike, and joey!! YoOhOo!! lol! so any ways today was a good dat for me!! Except for john and nate had to fuckin piss me off, cuz they spit a lot of lugees in Ricos shoes last nihgt when he was at my house and thast fuckin bull shit!! U dont go to someones house and fuck wiht their friends at their house!!So i said sumthin to him bout it today and i think that they BOTH should get their asses kicked cuz they are so fuckin immature bout the whole rico thing, it happend a long ass time ago and they need to get the fuck over it and move on wiht their fuckin lives!! DAMN! And plus rico doesnt even do anything to them he jus t sits there and takes their shit cuz he dont wanna start an even bigger fight between them 3 and jonh is fuckin older then rico and he is the one who should e more fuckin mature then rico but NOPE not happenin! and so brittani , john and nate are all pissed at me which Brittani has NO fuckin reason to be pissed at me but obviously she is and thats only cuz of john!! So what ever if they are the ones who wanna be immature they can just go for it cuz then at least rico can be the mature one and not do anythign!! like he is right now!! And brittani was like! ""i can garantee that if you get into there fight then jonh will fuckin hit you""!! I swear to FUCKIN god if that fucker lays one fuckin finger on me i will fuckin go nuts and hit him with his fuckin crutch!! Now im done getin ALL my anger out that i had to say so buh bye!!"

For you, sex is always fresh and new.

Gentle and slow, you aren't exactly known for your passion.

Well when we got there we had an hour befor her appointment, so we all wlked to starbucks to get a drink. Well tehn after that we went to her appointment anf we had to wait for like 45 mins. for the first thing she had to do. then we had to go to another floor so she could do another thing. then we went out to eat at the Rainforest Cafe. well when we got out it was fricken poring rain, so we ran to the car , but out car WASN'T there, automaticaly my mom starts vryin cuz were not from around there. So we go into Wallgreens cuyz thats were we parked, adn the manager said that we got towed, and that it would be $150 to get it out, and we didnt have 150 to get it out cuz we went out to eat adn we got some stuff. So we had to take a cab to the towing place cuz my papa chad was gunna wire us his cedit card or something like that, but the guys was like we dont take credit cards, only cash. So then we were in deep shit. So tehnw e walked like 5 blocks down that street, in the fuckin ghetto to a western union. So then when we got there we called joe back and asked him to wire us money but the dumb fuck wouldnt do it so we had to call my papa chad again and ask hime to wire us 150 dollars, and he would but it  would take a half and hour so we had to wait even longer for it to get there, and it costed $33 to wire it to us! Well when we got it we walked back down to the towing place and my mom was liek here now u can give me my damn car, and teh guys goes,and now u can give me ur damn licence. Then he goes treat ppl how u get treated. and my mom goes i am! and he was like haev a nice day all in a snotty voice , so i turn around and go oh trust me now i wont cuz i seen u!! He was soooo pist but who fuckin care's.Byes now!

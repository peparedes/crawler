"event","shortly after midnight last saturday, there was a fire two buildings down from our apartment. living in our neighborhood, we have become desensitized to the sirens, near or far. we're in close proximity to a fire station and our street is a 'fire alley' in that they use it to quickly get downtown. the building directly across the street from us has a faulty alarm system so the trucks are always coming over.

dag responds to every wailing siren with great bravado. in hindsight, we realized that he was barking up quite a storm and running out to us, circling, basically telling us something was up. we barely batted an eye. we were talking mess about saturday night live after all.

fiance knowles was the first to notice a smell. he checked the ashtray to be sure everything was out. it was. he glanced out the window and shouted to me, ""di! grab your shit! there's a fire! grab your pictures! let's go!"" i flew off the couch and up to the window. embers were flying through the air. flames flickered away from a building. this was serious.

as fiance harnessed up the dag and i changed into jeans (i was not going out in gauzy pj pants! fire be damned!) and grabbed my purse and glasses. all the while, the boy was telling me to grab our pictures. i just looked around and said, ""i can't! there's too much! let's just go."" 

in the quickest of instants, you realize you won't lose it all...if you lose it all.

<lj-cut text=""...""> 
the boy is the unofficial building monitor. he quickly ran up and down the floors banging on doors, waking people up, getting them out...just in case. we had to leave with out him. he'd have it no other way (damn hero!). in the haste, i remember grabbing stroller wheels and getting them down stairs. as soon as we got out of the building, we ran into a fire truck raising its ladder up onto our building (did i mention that our building and the 2 surrounding ones are wood shingled!). this was serious. 

folks from our building were gathering kitty corner to our address, eyes bleary, clothes rumpled. small smiles shared. looking up at my apartment, i felt nervous and light, as if a wind could catch a hold of me and send me down the street like the embers flying before us. instinctively, i called my mom. holding onto dag's leash and having the boy find us, i felt whole again. 

some of the OG's of the building (there was a bad fire a few years back that burned a church down) realized our building was ok and headed back in. a few us hung back, offering our cell phones to some of the displaced or to watch the circus that is fire fighting/life saving. you know that you have to be prepared to move quickly but you're also a kind of frozen too. 

thankfully there were no fatalities but <a href=""http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/03/14/BAG2CBOUGV1.DTL"">35 folks were left homeless.</a>

on the schedule this week: 

<b>1. a fire plan.</b> we want to consolidate and store all our photos together in an easily accessible location. we want to draft up a list of what is sentimental to both of us so that, in the event we're alone, we won't just grab our own stuff.

<b>2. counting our blessings</b></lj-cut>"

"event","there's been a real nasty flu taking folks out left and right. i got hooked up about two weeks ago. when i realized that i was coming down with something that had some real stank on it, i honestly felt...a bit trendy! what a dork. i don't like having the virus du jour (v.d.j.). i wanted to have something extra on it. mo flava! seriously, what's wrong with me!

i was out of the office a whole week and am back now and feel a whole lot of weak! ever tried to get out of bed only to feel like there's a big boot on your chest just keeping you down? so haggard. it took about 4 days to break my fever and another 2 to start walking around. i had to though. i felt my legs were about to atrophy from the inactivity. i had visions of lesions and my spine just falling out! of shady orderlies stealing my jewelry and casanovas wooing me out of my pension! whenever i'd wake up i'd wiggle my toes to make sure that i could.  i've seen my share of movie of the week's. i know the deal.

on day 7 of the v.d.j i decided to take the dag out. long story short, fiance knowles came out to the park to look for us because we had been gone so long. had he come a minute sooner he would've seen me posted on a park bench with dag looking up at me. i'd like to think he was waiting to see if i'd fall over and then run his little butt home and fetch the boy. i felt pathetic. i felt old. i felt that i better start putting more money into my 401K because i'm going to want a nurse in my old age! or at least a parking spot for my golf cart at my senior assisted living center. i may not have those kids to move in with so i gots to look out for myself!"

but ill feelings doesn't mean you have to dress ill. despite my non-rosy attitude , i decided to wear my rosy, mauvy metallic shoes con kitten heel today. i had to learn the hard way that the kitten heel fits like a glove in sidewalk cracks and grates. i can't tell you how many times it would snuggle into a crevice. when you're already side stepping feces, needles, baggies <i>and</i> maneuvering around the homeless the last thing you want to be conscientious of are the cracks and lines in the m-fing sidewalk. gah. at one point, i walked OUT OF a shoe! it had jammed just so in the concrete! i'm barely 5'2"" so my gait is not lengthy. i had to shorten my steps so as to fit w/in the lines of the sidewalk as i couldn't really over step each square. that would = drum majorette. i would need a baton to match my high steppin! *cue john philip sousa"

"event","have lived through a crazy last couple of weeks. glad to see them up in the rear view mirror now. 

the boy celebrated a birthday recently and ma dukes one week later. the boy gets a decorated apartment every birthday. i get crafty and cut out letters and hang things from the ceiling. special things for special days. we popped our collective foodtainment cherries and had dinner at benihana. we had a great group and fell for all of the skills our chef learned at benihana university. the boy was especially enamored with the chef's holster, empty bullet holders and all. it was all good, bad, ugly meets samurai. kampai mofo's!

we celebrated ma dukes' 50th by secretly having my sister fly out here from the boogie down and then secretly throwing a party for her...in her own house (<i>we also secretly changed the coffee with foolio's crystals!</i>)! if you haven't surprised anyone yet in your life like this, what are you waiting for?!? it's such a fuckin rush! and what a way to kick start a party!

it has been a particularly emotional couple of days for my family. between the announcement that the hotel lockout was being cooled off for the next 60 days (so pops would be heading back to work) to our auntie bebe in the kaiser icu to just having my sister out here, we were all covered with emotions. we needed the adrenaline from scaring the shit out of an unsuspecting member of our family! 

ma was pretty overwhelmed. it was like in the movies people! she opened the door and BLAM! surprise! horns blowing! people cheering! it was awesome. she went right into the arms of pops. who quickly proceeded to put her crazy bday hat on (of which he wore an equally cray cray hat of his own). she held onto him for a good 8 minutes. she was a teary eyed, shaky leaf. later she said that the culmination of emotions had finally bubbled up and she figured what better place to let it all out than in the arms of her man? and so she did.

happy birthday to my scorpios!"

without the pressure of multiple deadlines pushing me through the day it's tough staying focused and motivated right now. it's also a short week and you'd think that would put a fire under my ass but if anything i feel like the week is awash already, so why try! damn, how's that for work ethic!"

"event","before i left for the east coast i was clockin' 60+ hours a week. by the time i had decompressed from all that it was just about time to start packing up my stuff to come home. naively, i was surprised to be sucked right back into the insanity that is the office right now. 

10 minutes at my desk and my week in nyc was but a quickly passing memory. i tried to hold on to the sister time, the crisp, evening walks, shopping with my homeboy, my girl's growing belly (hurry up mario! i want to meet you already!) and dunkin donuts coffee but it was tough. i quickly resented the present as it slowly ate my past, tossing the bones at my feet.

getting out to nyc was totally last minute but it had perfect timing (not to mention cheap airfare). it was a complete pause on life. i left behind worker diana, girlfriend diana, budget conscious diana, food conscious diana. 

i woke up when i wanted. ate what i wanted. watched what i wanted. wandered around and got lost wherever i wanted. smoked what i wanted. slept when i wanted. spent what i wanted. it was exactly what i wanted. alas, you can only put life on pause for so long. *sigh. money has a way of speeding things up or bringing them to a complete halt.

it is good to be home. each time i leave sf i'm truly reminded that this is my home. my hat and heart are hung here.

highlights:

+ sister time (to incl, talking shit @ bloomingdales...or everywhere for that matter, citing girls with ""C.B.S."", Carrie Bradshaw syndrome [chicks trying to rock high heels no matter what])
+ having my own room in their new 2 bedroom apt
+ dunkin donuts coffee + cigarettes
+ i love it when you call me <a href=""http://muginohousa.com/index.html"">beard papa</a>!
+ changing foliage
+ buying a coat while in the land of coat wearing people
+ lots of new bling (door knockers to boot! yeah boyee, push it! push it real good!)
+ chivalry 
+ running into one of the sweetest sweethearts in soho (big up to chris!)
+ <a href=""http://www.marijuanalogues.com/"">marijuanalogues </a> + marijuana! 
+ my girl's growing belly. she is absolutely beautiful. just gorgeous with excitement and happiness. her man equally lit from within. back in the day when a homegirl got pregnant, it was more like, ""OH SHIT! what are you going to do?!?!"" but age has made it more like, ""WOW! miracle of life and shit!"" baby mario you are already so loved!
+ being in the bronx (and only a few blocks away from the stadium) when the bosox defeated the yanks
+ <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/20/dining/20UNDE.html"">kuma inn</a> and giving my compliments to the chef, shook his hand and everything. they were bumping pre-95 hip hop when we were there. so, so def!
+ my feline nephews, walter + storm

pickings can be slim on this final day but a good time was had by all. our necks were cramping from scouring all the tables and our bellies were beginning to talk to us. the fah-ree-ree-zing weather gave us a hankering for some fish and chips and that meant a trip over to <a href=""http://www.fudcourt.com/ecastle.html"">old chelsea fish n chips</a>. perfect food for when the fog is thick and low. malt vinegar is like lightening in the fog, electrifying and brilliant.

this place is tiny. as soon as you walk in you're up against the counter. behind that counter one old korean man, manning the deep fryers. there are two little tables and four mismatched chairs. in the corner a door with 'employs only' written on it in magic marker. sitting and eating in the pared down surroundings you can't help but feel that it's not entirely impossible that it could be a front for something. perhaps through the employs only door he's got a cock fighting ring, a playa's club or he's housing a unicorn. or maybe he's the last of the great magical sword makers or something. the mind wanders when the belly is empty and all you've got in front of you is time and not fried goodness.

"event","i work days. mr. fiance knowles works evenings. weeks can flow by without the two of us catching up with one another, despite living together. when you don't think you can make time kids, you got to take time. jack you some time.

we've got 3 rules for date night. (1) friday nights (2) just the two of us (3) on the cheap. cheap keeps things balanced and manageable. cheap makes me think of the early days. cheap keeps it easy to do every friday. cheap discourages any kind of monetary one-up-manship. 

last night was # 3 in this new series. 

#1 was dinner and a movie. doing it cheap meant citrus club and monty python's life of brian at the red vic. a first for me on both points. my co-workers were floored when they learned that i had not seen it...ever. their gasps so exaggerated i could step into their moufs! <i>and if i could, i'd wear a miner's lamp and holler out 'hellooooooooo! helllllooooo' adding my own echo, of course.</i>

with time to kill between dinner and the movie, our noodle-filled bellies ended up at amoeba (ruh roh, there goes keeping things cheap! gah.) we cracked up over album covers, he stole a slow dance amidst the cd's and we burped up mad garlic! sorry amoeba folkels. 

#2 was an @home joint (actually a pipe but that doesn't quite have the same ring to it) and chris rock's never scared on dvd. hee-haw-larious. i would drop a quote now from the dvd but the memories are a bit cloudy. i do remember that we were cracking up simultaneously at one point. it felt like we were in a parallel universe where you communicate through laughter. i'd try to say something but i'd only laugh and he'd try to ask me what i was trying to say but couldn't because he was rollin. fuck a <a 
href=""http://muscleweb.com/john/"">john basedow</a>  just start cracking up.

#3 was a bit more civilized but still cheap. chardonnay, stuffed peppers w/tuna (surprisingly very spicy = dragons!),caprese salad, garlic & herb cheese, pugliese, chive crackers, mixed berries, pineapple and scharfenberger chocolate pudding! kapow! and shaolin soccer! bladow! when we finished off the one bottle, mr. fiance knowles in accordance w/rule #3 of date night went out and got some forties of which i had none. a girl has her standards, seriously though, i'm just not a beer drinker. 

the great thing about date night is, well, it's still a date and not just another night in our lives together. i still get prepped. i'm turnin up the charm. he'll gussy it up too by either shaving or putting on his best pj's. companionship and no awkward moments at the front door. life can be sweet...if you let it.

"event","the light at the end of the tunnel, that is.

i toughed it out. i dug in my heels. i stuck by my guns. i gritted the teefs.

my jobby job situation is a little less perilous now, since i last updated. i still have one, for starters (thank jhova) and more of the one i wanted. for almost a year i have been assisting His team (in addition, to my own team's work load). the work increasingly went above and beyond what we had agreed to not to mention what i am capable of and at a minimum even interested in doing (particularly for Him. Him = can't deal - non confrontational -  poor communicator - reactive vs. proactive - non ego checker - brat). 

i was hating coming to work every day. <i>that </i>had to stop w/the quickness. i was on a very slippery slope. i had to talk to him. before i could approach Him i had to come to terms with the fact he could pull a trump and give me the old cobra 'you're fired' hand action (can't truss no one, people!) once i got my mind around that and completely over any anxieties about work performance and corporate loyalty i prepared to talk to Him. i was going to calmly tell him that i was not the person for his team and that they really needed a dedicated and experienced project manager blah blah blah...BUT before i could get some time with him this mofo announces that they're now looking for a project manager. send all applicants his way.

He makes this announcement w/o having talked to me at all! My reaction, 

""WHAT? oh, so you wanna break up <i>with</i> me?! oh hell to the no, i already broke up with you! and you think you gon' git another girl while i'm still hanging around?! FINE! a'ite. peace!""

well, it wasn't quite like that but it's exactly how i felt. had i not wanted to let go of his team already i would've really been mad that he would make a decision w/o either criticizing or just fuckin acknowledging the work i had been doing. whatevs. i'm putting Him in my rear view mirror.

i've got a smidge of senioritis now, as i wait for them to just begin the interviewing process. let me go already!

big sigh."

I just want to start clearing my desk already. Begin the archiving. Hug people that I normally wouldn't but we're standing around a cake that says good luck to me so I should. I want to have $11 cocktails paid for by the company I am leaving. I want to tell people that I will keep in touch...and mean it (to most of 'em). I want to stash post-its of various sized in my purse. I really want to shake the glum that waits for me in the morning as I get ready to go to work and deal with HIM. 

Yes, I am in a bit of a rough patch here but how much more of it do I want, I ask myself.

"event","my desk sits next to a conference room. with that, the folks here treat it as if its a water table along a foot race running by and grabbing what they can for their meeting with absolute disregard. i know this stuff isn't mine per se, that it's the company's but damn! 

that is why the pencil cup is now filled with

6 sharpies of various widths and colors
3 unsharpened pencils
2 pencils in desperate need of sharpening or whittlin (depending on which side of the mississippi you're on) sans erasers
1 berol china marker - brite orange 174T
1 berol verithin pencil - scarlet red 744
1 pair of dull scissors
1 highlighter
1 bic white-out pen
1 exacto knife

i haven't bothered to refill it with anything proper. too funny is the face of the person who was running late, grabbed an instrument, lands into a seat and begins taking notes. only to find out they're using a sharpie! their scribbling bleeding through 2 maybe even 3 pages! ha ha. the fumes catch glances from the others seated at the table. tsk tsk. sharpie = not prepared! you might as well be in your pajamas they way some folks shake their heads.

funny is not the face of the person who hovers above the cup, picking things up, slamming them back into the cup and sighing. frustrated with the flat pencils and exacto knife. i just tell them that the selection is as such because of FOOLS like you! bring it next time!

my beloved pen (pilot dr. grip gel w/ergo rubber tip in a silvery metal finish) is always in sight if not in use. i hesitate to have someone 'use it for just a sec.' my eyes following it making sure they don't take any steps or any quick moves to their pocket. often, the sec borrower will look at it all curious and say, 'hmm, nice pen' at which i am ready to karate chop should they pull a bully move and just bogart it. this gets noticed. at first it was a bit embarrassing but i'm serious about my stuff! my penmanship is already crazy. it does not play well with sharpies or wax pencils! the comments usually have words like damn! and girl it's just a pen or hawk eye! 

if i'm in need of a signature, i will offer my pen. it's a nice gesture. it's tough though. my hand immediately reaching out for it just as they've dotted that last i or crossed that last t. it's a dope fiend move! if i could i would have them sign the document whilst i sign w/them. piggy backin!

at night or even when i leave for lunch, dr. grip goes in the drawer! i don't bring this bitch w/me off site because i know it'll just run away from me. it will want to hide in the bottom of tote bags or backs of jeans. funny is not the face of a girl w/o her dr.grip! (no comments from the peanut gallery, please.)

dr. grip is cool but not so cool that i'd wear it around my neck. i don' t think i'll ever where a pen around my neck. i don't see nurse or census taker in my future. obsessive compulsive paranoid, yes but field reporter, no."

"event","friday afternoon i cut out of work early to check out david sedaris at my local independent bookstore. the event was to hop off at 7pm, i joined the others in line at 4:45 (!). despite sleepy foots and low blood sugar feelings felt later, it was worth it. 

he arrived around 5. he wasn't working the crowd so much as working his way through it. he was more slight and shorter than i envisioned. which made sense because he was very down to earth. 

he was dressed like the teachers i always had crushes on in school. a bit prim and preppy (crisp, pink striped oxford shirt and complementary baby blue and yellow tie. substantial fabric) but not stuffy (khakis and touchable hair, not waxed into place). he's approachable and friendly something that i expect from someone with an accent like his. 

i could see him weaving through the crowd. my eyes followed him like a bobbing balloon on the end of a child's wrist. a glimpse of his shirt. a corner of his smile. i'd see how the folks would straighten up around him. laugh. shift their feet making room for him. he got closer. 

i could feel my tongue get thick in my mouth. nervousness making it heavy like with syrup but drier. what's the big deal, i thought? he's just going to sign my book not car jack me or challenge me to a duel.

i was having two books signed. one to salt (my absent friend) and the other to pepa (long story...and not a long story from like 88). i was happy that i stuck with this personalization. he laughed. 

he asked what was i doing that weekend. i struggled. i stumbled and finally mumbled, reading the book (ugh! so lame. lame wanna be kiss ass kind of line! reeks of smarmy groupie!). what are you doing this weekend, i returned. '""um, i'm on this book tour..."" - gah! yes, of course.

face in flames. my eyes fell to the floor and wondered why it betrayed me when it did not open up and swallow me.  

he signed my book, ""to pepa, yer' solid trippin""

swoon.

i love how a new shirt or a haircut can get the corners of your mouth lifted, permagrin styles. kool-aid smile styles! his swagger seems more swaggier and i'm definitely responding to it.

heat brings the crushes on for me. you're outside. seeing each other beyond the apartment. beyond the piles of laundry and stacks of dishes. beyond your regular life. no woollen jackets or heavy meals to get in the way. we're strolling down streets, crushing on our city and the folks in it. sun on skin. easy clothes. big smiles. prime conditions to set your heart a flutter.

"event","lately, i've been more of a worrier than a warrior (sing it patty smith!). i worry about things that are happening, things that are going to happen, things that aren't happening, things that have happened. i'm consumed with worry. sometimes it feels good...if you justify your worry because you care so that means you're not a robot but most of the time it feels not so good. i don't like not being able to enjoy a moment or laugh lightly because worry is on the horizon. worry is like weights on the corners of my mouth. it weighs down my smile. you know, i've been to known to worry that i am not worrying! what the hell type of shit is that? i am worry's bitch. 

i've been stressing about an upcoming meeting with a client. it was supposed to happen on friday. it did not and got moved to monday. initially, i thought, phew! more time to prepare but really it's like more time to stress. i'm roaming around my city, lost in my headphones (dj neil armstrong providing the soundtrack) and then, bam! the knot in my stomach tightens when i realize that the clock continues to tick towards monday. 

monday comes and the client pushes it until the following morning. the meeting has come and gone. i did not scare off the big client. faux pas and goof up stayed their asses at home and let me deal. i am post-meeting and post-worry. i feel great, tony the fuckin tiger, g-r-r-r-eat! i can't help but think that at times, i worry so much, working my self into a frenzy (= vente worry-ccino) to heighten the post-worry high, masochistic stylez.

SUV driver is surprised that the girth of his car has not intimidated but rather motivated our pedestrian and steps down and out from his monster. ""don't you fuckin touch my car!""  and pushes him. another's hands on <i>his</i> body. his heart beats once and his hands are on another's body. his fist connects with that face. <i>hard.</i> the suv driver rocks back with the force. he stumbles away back into his monster, back into the night, tail between his legs. in tact, he adjusts his hat.

"event","what criteria does a happy place have to meet to be considered happy? you're often told to find a happy place in order to escape from the place you're at <i>that</i> exact moment...the dentist chair, under scrutiny, waiting to exhale.

anyone ever try to find the happy place in the moment they're in? free laughing gas, all eyes on me, seasons <b>will</b> change. 

when you conjure up your happy place, is it past or future? ...when you and yours were broke and struggling and it was good times all around...or when you win the lotto? 

i can always remember the weather and it wasn't always sunny. when i think to the future, it's always flooded with light. i think that's funny."

"event","accidart, the accidental fart. mood killer or ice breaker? 

accidart. a route marker in the journey that is your relationship with someone. a slight pause at a peculiar fork in the road.

we've all done it. you're chilling with your homie.lover.friend. you're tussling. you're wrassling. he's tickling and then pffft. accidart. usually very airy, more bark then bite. 

do you take the high road and play it off. like what? who let that frog into the room? 

or the even higher road and not acknowledge it at all. other than your note to self ""note to self: i think i just got away with it. snicker snicker or pfft pfft! i'm so clever! he'll think i'm one of those mythical girl creatures that never expels nothing! i love this! this could be big! p.s. to self: research internal combustion due to never expelling nothing. ""

he may grab your hand and take you down the low road, laughing with a ""oh no you didn't!"" or a ""you're so nasty with your loose boot!"" and then release his dogs and fart, purposefully and forcibly. damn near breaking a sweat (unless he's like some folks who's always got a bomb ready to go...begin footage now of paratrooper ready for a jump...go! go! go!)  on your acci-prone ass! dutch oven? that's the good times right there! 

but people, if the accidart happens and your h.m.l. commences all tom foolery from their inability to deal with the body electric, then let that be their send off. show them the road that they can take."

"event","ma dukes went to a bachelorette party. prudishness made ma real nervous that a stripper was going to show up. ""everytime there was a knock on the door, i would run behind someone else."" i just know that she would do this with her little ma hands covering her mouth, giggles escaping like bubbles. 

a stripper did not show up but rather an elvis impersonator (bachelorette is a fan). apparently, he wasn't very good as the bachelorette requested a song that he didn't know, DUM! and he has the gall to don the white jumpsuit! for shame, elvis impersonator! for shame! the whole time, of course, ma was hiding because she was not going to be out of the woods until he left. why the apprehension? 

ma could of enjoyed a male dancer but my sister and i have filled her head with horror stories and urban legends. stories of gyrations in your face and his body glitter on your clothes. the worse by far being a story of a dancer rubbing his stripper pole all up in a bride-to-be's grill. the next morning, when the bdt awoke she couldn't open her eyes. she wasn't having an allergic reaction. the peepers were shut down by stripper man's crabs!! <i>vomit</i> 

the party had the usual gag gifts and lingerie. someone gave the 'lorette a penis enlarger. inside the box she found a magnifying glass.  pretty ha ha but even funnier was having ma tell me about it. what made it funny was ma's accent. that pinoy accent works like a charm everytime! yes, yes we american borns can be so cruel, whatebs.

ma: yes, it was pennys enlarger
me: a penny enlarger? is that like a money tree? some prosperity garnering tool for the couple?
ma: no, pennys! pennys!
me: pen-ese? wth!
ma: pennys! pennys! you know, like <i>down there!</i>
me: i love you"

"event","one of my guilty pleasures is being an undercover asshole.

when i'm riding the bus and i spy someone about to request a stop i like to try and yank the cord before they do! HA! if i'm feeling particularly assholey i won't hesitate to take the opportunity away from a child! a child, people! super delicious is catching a toddler reaching...just r-e-a-c-h-i-n-g with its grubby, chubby toddler fingers towards the cord. their mama propping them up against the window, saying, ""yes, now! you can do it now!""

undercover asshole, i tell you! and ruthless to boot! undercover because i only do this from a safe distance from said stop requestor. let the record state, i diana, am allergic to confrontation. throat closes up keeping words down. brain tells heart, giddy yup! beads of sweat are strung across the forehead. oh and the hives, yeah the hives! nestle crunch people! someone get me an epipen!

this evening, while riding the bus home, i spied an abuelita preparing to request a stop. her head was bobbing left and right. that's MY stop coming up, she probably thought. she checks landmarks outside of the window. her timing was telling. this was no rookie. she had been around the (this) block before.

she knew she couldn't pull that cord right when the bus pulled away from the curb. driver might think that you want that stop and slam on the breaks...and then you'd have to speak up (or in my case squeak up, see above for allergy), ""my bad. next stop, homie!"" would equal persecution on a crowded rush hour bus. worse yet, angry mob kind of worse yet, is if you don't say anything at all and the bus is just sitting there.

her slight hesitation, this one beat was all i needed! and with the same swiftness you would use to phone check your home boy on a pay phone, i got her! (cue up image of hawk swooping down on a snake) 

DING! 

stop request requested, DENIED! get yo hand outta there!! (now cue image of home plate umpire, face mask up and aggro thumb action.)

i was amused with myself. snickered even. abuelita hrmpfed. 

undercover assholeness...a guilty and simple pleasure. get them where you can, people."

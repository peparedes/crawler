"event","Family was out today, errand for Seb's first birthday party at Shakey's El Pueblo. We passed by first at the 'eatery' which I forgot the name, near the Ortigas Wet Market for our lunch before heading to Shakey's. We had crabs cooked in butter and garlic (which I and &nbsp;hubby didn't get to finish because we cannot eat well because we have to take turns on carrying Seb - no high chair), fried tanigue for Anika which she liked and halaan.&nbsp;After the Shakey's errand before going home we strolled at the Podium for a while and get the things hubby needed for his trip.

On another note, it's me and the kids for the night. The hubby left for the Bar ops when we got home."

I can't get rid of you
I don't know what to do
I don't even know who is growing on who
'Cos everywhere I go you're there
Can't get you out of my hair
Can't pretend that I don't care - it's not fair

I'm being punished for all my offences
I wanna touch you but I'm afraid of the consequences
I wanna banish you from whence you came
But you're part of me now
And I've only got myself to blame

You're really growing on me
(Or am I growing on you?)
You're really growing on me
(Or am I growing on you?)
Any fool can see

Sleeping in an empty bed
Can't get you off my head
I won't have a life until you're dead
Yes, you heard what I said

<b>I wanna shake you off but you just won't go
And you're all over me but I don't want anyone to know
That you're attached to me, that's how you've grown
Won't you leave me, leave me alone</b>

You're really growing on me
(Or am I growing on you?)
You're really growing on me
(Or am I growing on you?)
Any fool can see

You're really growing on me
(Or am I growing on you?)
You're really growing on me
(Or am I growing on you?)"

"event","Artist: Goo Goo Dolls Lyrics 

Could you whisper in my ear 
The things you wanna feel 
I'll give you anything 
To feel it comin' 

Do you wake up on your own 
And wonder where you are 
You live with all your faults 

Chorus: 
I wanna wake up where you are 
I won't say anything at all 
So why don't you slide 

Yeah we're gonna let it, slide 

Don't you love the life you killed 
The priest is on the phone 
Your father hit the wall 
Your ma disowned you 

Don't suppose I'll ever know 
What it means to be a man 
Something I can't change 
I'll live around it 

Chorus 

And I'll do anything you ever 
Dreamed to be complete 
Little pieces of the nothing that fall 
May put your arms around me 
What you feel is what you are 
And what you are is beautiful 
May do you wanna get married 
Or run away 

And I'll do anything you ever 
Dreamed to be complete 
Little pieces of the nothing that fall 
May put your arms around me 
What you feel is what you are 
And what you are is beautiful 
May do you wanna get married 
Or run away 

Chorus"

"event","Who'd have thought
This is how the pieces fit?
You and I
Shouldn't even try making sense of it

I forgot
How we ever came this far
I believe we had reasons
but I don't know what they are
So blame it on my heart, oh

Love moves in mysterious ways
It's always so surprising
When love appears over the horizon
I'll love you for the rest of my days
But still, it's a mystery 
How you ever came to me
Which only proves
Love moves in mysterious ways

Heaven knows
Love is just a chance we take
We make plans 
But then love demands a leap of faith


So hold me close
And never let me go
'Cause even though we think we know 
which way the river flows
That's not the way love goes, no

Love moves in mysterious ways
It's always so surprising
When love appears over the horizon
I'll love you for the rest of my days
But still, it's a mystery
How you ever came to me
Which only proves
Love moves in mysterious ways

Like the ticking of the clock
two hearts beat as one
But I'll never understand
the ways it's done

Love moves in mysterious ways
It's always so surprising
When love appears over the horizon
I'll love you for the rest of my days
But still, it's a mystery
How you ever came to me
Which only proves
Love moves in mysterious ways
Love moves in mysterious ways"

"event","damn, time is most definitely flying fast. seconds turn into minutes and minutes turn into hours and hours into days and days into weeks and so on and so on.

i've spent some time thinking of my current situation. for so long, i've been void of romance and all of a sudden, a certain guy i'm really fond of came out of the scene again. sort of an old flame who was somehow reignited again.

anyway, this guy was a classmate way back in grade school. back then we were never close. it was only when we meet again a few years ago that we became like buddies. i was already working then and he's still in school. from then on, from time to time we would go out have a drink, chit chat here and there, the usual. most of the time with the presence of other friends. we went out before but because of circumstance and other factors, we never became an item although I like him.

now, he's getting in touch with me again. i was surprised but found myself real happy when he came to visit me. 

however, here comes the tough part. i think i made such a wrong move and i get queassy about it. i shouldn't have fell into the trap but... ughh! now i don't know what will i do next. i wouldn't want to screw things up again coz i really like him but i made a mistake already. i don't want another good thing to just slip through my hands again.

i'm bothered and confused."

"event","from my last post, i talked about going to the wedding of a friend yesterday. you know what happened? i didn't get the chance to ride with my friend as what i've stated coz again i got lazy to get up in time. i kind'a had qualms about going coz i'm late and don't have a gift to bring. but eventually, i'd decided to go regardless. i went on my own. the ceremony was already finished when i reached the church. i'm just glad that they haven't left yet coz i don't know where the reception would be. i saw other friends and ride along with them to the reception place. i wouldn't bore you on the trivial details of the reception coz i know you know what goes on a wedding reception. well, as it should be, the wedding turned out well. the wedding finished off early so we decided to go hang out somewhere and go for booze.

i didn't get back home only til this evening.

oh, just a note. in the group, i'm the only girl who doesn't have a partner.

caio for now"

"event","i should still be in bed sleeping by now. but because i woke up very late this morning i can't get to sleep. i must leave early this morning for my friend's wedding. well, i wouldn't have to if i don't want to. the wedding starts at 3 pm and i don't have any participation in it. i'm just invited to attend. but to save money and avoid rush i have to go to my friend's place for the ride. 

but you know what? i feel like not going. i feel lazy in going. i never really liked going to this kind of gatherings. i don't know why. i can't describe the feeling. i just can't put it into words. the thought of seeing other friends again is what keeps me in going.

anyways, on another note. i went out with my cousin earlier to buy a gift for this wedding. but my budget's out of hand. i didn't have enough money for the item i chose to buy and couldn't find something cheaper but nice so i made up my mind. i guess she won't shoo me away for not having one. maybe i'll just find a way to get one later if i still have time. or maybe just ask my other friend to add my name on her gift. hehe. guess she'll understand.

in the street on the way back home, walking toward a food store to get something to take home, i bumped into an old chum from highschool. just a quick exchanging of greetings before we head off. and there includes jokingly remarked on my front bumpers. of all the parts in my body to be noticed! oh guys!

well, that would be it for now. i hope i won't get lazy to get up later."

i didn't know that you can get your hands callouses and blisters in ironing piles and piles of clothes specially on a very hot and humid day. maybe not to those that're used to it. actually, i'm not sure. 

anyway, i got my lazy ass up yesterday. the people in the house were like teasing me for one. ironing clothes specially loads is very infrequent for me to do. who would like to press stacks of clothing anyway? but yesterday (i don't know what's got into me) i performed the chore. but i didn't last long. after pressing a few i stopped and rest for a while coz i didn't like the feeling that it brought to my hand. but at 1:30am i decided to carry on coz the hell i don't know why but i wanted to and sleep still eludes me. i pressed more clothes until around 3:00am.

staying up til odd hours and sleeping to odd hours make me do unusual things. i should try to sleep at better times now."

it's when you're alone that the pain hits you. the television just isn't good enough companion. a good book is always good but then the book isn't really good for snuggling. then it really hurts... the loneliness gets to you. i mean i should get used to this by now but it never gets any easier. i mean, at times i just want to go out with someone for the sake of having someone but then that wouldn't be right now would it? it really sucks being alone.

i guess i'm in one of those depressed moods. it'll go anyway. argh!"

"event","today is suppose to be my third day as a tele-marketer trainee but because of my lazy nature, i didn't go today. yes, i never thought i would get into this type of work. i got into this job because of my cousin. she was asked by a friend and she tagged me along with her. on that same day we got the job. at first i was quite not interested because it isn't my line. well, talking to people over the phone is easy but convincing them for some product is another story. and to tell you it really is a difficult job. especially if the product you're offering isn't that essential to have. 

anyway, it was just a temporary work and it wont take long. just to have something to do and make me busy for a while. and the call center isn't that far away from our house. i could get back home after work in time for the latest craze in town - MG. =P would you believe that i included MG into consideration before i accepted the job? crazy me. =P  hehehe. just glad they changed the time slot to a better time.

by the way, have my new hair cut done. i'm back to my old short hair style after a while of having my hair long."

"event","It's been a while. 

I've gone from a training Mikki, Joyce and I enrolled in. Trully an experience!

I was invited by Mikki to join them in applying for a luxury cruise ship. I thought she was only kidding me at first. I came to know that it was true and they're serious about it when I dropped by their office one time. But before we could get hired and aboard the ship we need to have this seaman's book as a requirement and to get this we need to enroll for a basic training course. And in not so many words we enrolled in this Maritime Training Center.

Briefly...

For eight days this training lasted. We were given roughly crash courses on Basic Safety Training that involves Personal Survival Techniques, Fire Prevention and Fire Fighting, Elementary First Aid and Emergency Procedures and another course on Personal Safety and Social Responsibilities. The first three days were spent on lectures. A written exam was given each day after every lecture to move onto the next course. The next three days were all practical exams and the rest were lectures again.

It has been fun going to this training course. We met different types of people. Some naturally funny and cool, like our PST instructor Chief Menez. The way he speaks, what he speaks of, his looks, it really comes off natural to him. Not like the others who were trying hard to be funny just to catch some attention especially from us few girls even if they look over acting and gave off an aura that would really get on to one's nerve especially if you girl has a very little patience. Like this veeery malicious-minded instructor we encountered. <i>Nang magsabog ng kalibugan ang Diyos isa siya sa maraming nakakuha.</i>

Anyways, the coolest part of the training was the practicum. They have a practicum site in Laguna where we did some of our practical exams for two days. We were asked to jump from a 10-ft high diving platform into the water with a life jacket. It was really scary and I've done it. cool! We also had exams on fire fighting and search and rescue with breathing apparatus. Exhausting! One of the girls in my group collapsed from too much exhaustion.

It was one memorable experience. And of course the best part was passing the training and receiving the certificate."

How are you? 

Days past and I haven't heard from you. I know I shouldn't be expecting from you for reasons I simply must understand. You just don't know how hard it is to be in my situation. There's not a single day that I did not think of you. I've tried to find other means just so to get you out of my head but there's always something that would remind me of you.

How long will I keep on thinking of you?

I remember one time you told me about divorcing your wife. I did not make any comment about it. I love you so much but I never wanted to destroy a family specially yours. I know that you are one a family man. You dearly love your children. You wouldn't do something that would hurt them. However, deep inside I had hoped...

I have a dream about you last night. In my dream you were with your wife and when you saw me you embraced me tightly and told me that you're sorry for not having been in touch with me for a while because you're dealing with your marriage. I didn't say anything like what I used to do. I just embraced you back tightly, look up at you and give you an it's-alright-i-understand smile. Then you left with your wife. The thing I had hoped for happened in that dream. You were in a room and your wife was crying while you were talking to her. I could see you but couldn't hear what you were saying to her. But somehow I knew that it was about leaving her. I can't explain what I felt at that moment. Neither am I happy nor sad. I just don't know what it is I felt. I woke up in that state.

I miss you everdearest. I can't wait to see you again. I hope I would hear from you soon.

"event","The Enneagram Test
What the Ancient Science of Personality Says About You 

shazza, you're a Type 3 - The Entertainer 

Friends, family, and colleagues likely look up to you for this passion and drive. They're also apt to know that when they come to you with a problem, you can be counted on help them find the kind of solution that will lead to greater self-knowledge and personal growth. You often motivate and inspire others by your good example alone. As an Entertainer, you're also likely to be seen as a valuable and competent person who is worthy of admiration.

Being a member of this type puts you in good company. Oprah Winfrey, with her worldwide influence and recognition, and Michael Jordan, one of the most recognized sports figures of all time, are also Type 3s. 

This means that compared to the eight other Enneagram types, you have a strong sense of self worth, which you're not afraid to show off in a public way. In fact, you're the kind of energetic, charming person who is often committed to being the very best that you can be."

Even if you're not from the green isles, you just might share in some of that luck o' the Irish. The four-leaf clover is your lucky charm. 

Druids used four leaf clovers to see evil spirits and friendly fairies. If you start seeing magical things however, we recommend laying off the clovers for a while. In fact, you don't even need to possess the actual clover. A necklace, pendant, key chain or tattoo promises the same good fortune of the ancients. 

Take note brides and grooms-the mere dream of a four-leaf clover foretells of a successful marriage. Actually finding one might mean quadruplets.</i>"

"event","it was sometime in 1991, my freshman year, when i joined a group in UPLB named THE PUTAGIDS. i really don't know exactly when and how it was formed. i didn't mind asking. i'm only acquainted by the fact that it's a group of freshies whom started this. i only got invited by a blockmate who's with the group. i joined in when i found out that it's alright to join. it's just like having a big circle of friends to hang out in and out of the campus. we have been quite known at that time, they said.

it's been years of fun, togetherness, friendship, and chaos. a trully memorable one. but eventually, we've gone our separate ways... through different paths of our chosen careers. we still get in touch though, but not regularly and not with everybody.

nov 23, on the birthday of a member at his place in novaliches! we get together again. it was suppose to be a 'grand reunion' but for some reasons not all came. but it hasn't been bad at all. even if we're few it was fun. over bottles of SMB, we exchanged kumustahans, kant'yawans and reminisced those good old days when we were all together. We drank until the wee hours of the morning just like what we used to do. 

it's nice to see and hear that everybody's doing well. most of the boys and only few of the girls were married and have children. i just notice, nobody married somebody or is in partner with somebody from the group. well, there has been two couples before, <i>s'yempre kasali ako dun, =) </i> but they didn't end up together. that's one nice thing about our group, we're all friends. <i>hindi kami talu-talo.</i> hmmm... i'm thinking of breaking the record! hehehe.

now that we've get in touch again, hopefully, in the next reunion everybody could attend."

After-sex Comments by Astrological Signs

Aries: ""Okay, let's do it again!""
Taurus: ""I'm hungry -- pass the pizza.""
Gemini: ""Have you seen the remote?""
Cancer: ""When are we getting married?""
Leo: ""Wasn't I fantastic?""
Virgo: ""I need to wash the sheets.""
Libra: ""I liked it if you liked it.""
Scorpio: ""Perhaps I should untie you.""
Sagittarius: ""Don't call me -- I'll call you.""
Capricorn: ""Do you have a business card?""
Aquarius: ""Now let's try it with our clothes off!""
Pisces: ""What did you say your name was again?""

and on another's somebody quoted:
""if you hate your job and still go into work, whats the difference between yourself and a whore?""

well, it's really nothing. just got my attention."

i got a text message from my aunt in laguna last saturday, asking me if i'll be home that day 'coz a friend of my aunt in canada will introduce somebody to me that just came from the states. wala pa raw gf. i frowned and in my mind i said 'not again'. but then i replied ok. i'm going home anyway. and to make the story short, we met just this morning before i left for the office. just a little chat and that's it. i'm not interested. i felt nothing. no appeal. but in fairness he's nice and polite. he even took a shot of us including my mom for remembrance he said he'll send to my aunt in canada. whatever!

what's funny is that my mom's the one excited for me. she even cut off work just to see and welcome the guests. =)

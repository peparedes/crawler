"event","so i failed my ps test. that kinda sucks..and by 2% too. i dont like thi whole failing thin. hope its not something i have to get used to..never really had to deal with it. except of course when i steal my brothers gamecube and that embarrassing LEVEL FAILED! flashes onscreen. but i can deal with that. this however puts a few things on hold..but at least public transport is free on new years eve? wooo i have a long vline ahead of me. and thats when i actually get to geelong. dang.
in other news my mums taken to drinking more than a bottle of wine a day. and rearranging furniture. and wondering why shes all sore the next day. (in her sober period). meh, my room got redone kinda cool. i have retro tables from the seventies. they have glass :D and i broke out the old lava lamp to add to the effect haha
i really should have people down here sometime. maybe when i finally pass my driving test...and my parents actually leave. thank god for the beach thats all i can say!
the cousins are coming down today to stay for like a week. every year they come. and every year theyre disappointed im not here for new years. you'd think theyd be used to that by now!
you know the start of that seventies show where theyre all in the car and rocking round? yeah thats us...soon. for now im mad at peanut. im sure its his fault somehow the stupid hulk of metal.
buh-bye xx"

"event","tis the season to be jolly! the extended family somehow find a way to take it too far of course, but then again we always do. plenty of antics, a very early morning brought on by the roudy brother (he took a break from computer games to open.. you guessed it! more games. and some robot which scares me and the doglets)
i however woke to a stocking containing.. a toothbrush! wow, thanks santa. you rock! not the only thing with my name on it under the tree, but the most entertaining to unwrap. everything other than random little things had to be charged before i could use them... so i couldnt even play with my new toys all day(yes including the toothbrush!) on a brighter note, i started programming peoples addresses into my navigation thingy so expect a random visit to your houses! (nb. this does not extend to creepy people who stumble across this page. in fact, you dont even have to be creepy. it just doesnt =P)
once the initial presenting was over, twas time to prepare for dinner with the whooole of mums family. lets just say it ended with people passed out everywhere. me and the randomly redhead cousin were kept rather amused documenting this with my new camera. 
champagne breakfast this morning. and then lunch. and onto the red right now at dinner. mmm steaks. or in my case... corn jacks. i swear my family would be the type to serve up a whole pig with an apple in its mouth. im actually waiting for the day. shall keep you posted.
sleepy little country town is good for thinking, it seems im not missing much back home. except the people of course. but at the same time, its a nice change of pace after such an eventful week. ahh teen angst and drama. wouldnt be a successful sitcom of my life without it.
im looking forward to new years though, havent been out for awhile. and there should be a heap of people there.. if it goes through. i hope it goes through. granted, theres only one person i want to be with for the turning of the new year. but we'll just see what happens there. havent quite set my resolutions and who they include..
anyway, im off. might be able to get some more driving in in the dark.. went for a big drive today and did a perfect reverse parallel park! if i dont get my licence on friday im going to be tres upset... peanut is longing for some bonding time alone. with his new pink number plates. baha, just you wait and see.
mwah xx"

"event","<p>the most tragic thing i find about death is that its so final. thats it, thats the end. time is lost, grief is gained. and even when you try and keep it to yourself it spreads.. like tendrils of a vine to people you probebly dont even realise.&nbsp;people who want to help, but there is simply nothing to do. nothing to say. what if they could have had just a little longer, prolonged the inevitable as long as they could. but is there ever a perfect time? i see nothing delicate about death, nothing peaceful and tranquil. i dont see how anyone could possibly say 'they died peacefully', when they are being wrenched away from a world of love and hope, a world where there are people who will always care; who will always remember. and people cannot die without pain; i truly believe that. even if there is nothing physical the sheer pain of what they are leaving behind cannot be discarded. even people who do not realise theyre dying just pass on their pain, to the people who they leave behind. there are always ones left behind. and what can you do? there is nothing to say or do to make it better, nothing will ease it all away. sympathy is overated; 'im so sorry' never made anyone feel any better. <br />death touches us all, it touches our friends, our family, even people who seem so immune and happy; it can haunt your past, present and future. and even when you know it's coming, theres still never enough time.&nbsp;they say appreciate what you have while you have it, but who really listens? you look at people who have lost what you've always had and you wonder.. how would you manage? what would you do? and while it seems inconcievable to some, i guess i already have that perspective. because i know its only a matter of time before im there too, its just not as set in concrete when; how much time there is left that simply gets taken for granted.<br />i know they feeling of not wanting anyone to know. not wanting people to look at me differently, with that eye of sympathy. ive had it before. so id probebly do the same, keep everything bottled inside until the final moment, when theres no point closing up anymore. when theres no point at all because it just cant stay hidden. but what is the point of everyone knowing anyway? the floodgates will open to a bombardment if hugs and 'im so sorry's no matter when they find out.<br />i wish there was something i could do, something i could say. but there isnt, and its just not my place.</p>"

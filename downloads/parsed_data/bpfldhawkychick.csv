"event","well we found this dog on saterday.  it is the sweetest dog you could ever meet.  it listens so well and is just so awsome.  when we found it, it was super skinny and you could tell that the owners before didnt take good care of it.  and if you ask me, then they should die and go to hell!!.. i want them to live an eternity of sorrow and pain.  they need to have a slow painful death!! ne one who treats a dog that bad should be shot!.  but ne ways..my mom said that she doesnt want a dog that big and w/e. and we cant bring it inside cause of how bad it smells and it looks so helpless.  my dad is being such an ass about it too.  he is the only one who dosent show ne sympathy towards it.  all this morning i have been so upset over the thing.  i want it so bad cause it looks so sad and helpless.  i hate how this always seems to happen...."

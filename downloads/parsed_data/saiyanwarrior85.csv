"event","Well last night I over to my girlfriends house, to be with her after a very scary night on my part. She thought I like somebody else, which I think is pretty crazy because I'm love her so much. I don't blame her after what happened before(only a few people would know what I'm talking about). I tried my very best to explain to her how I felt about her and I think I might have got through a little bit, but still think she has a lot of doubts. I just dont want to lose her. She is like the most important thing in the world to me. I'd do anything for her. I also made her card, that I really hope she liked. I love being with her so much. She's so great, she's the best girl in the world. She's so beautiful too. I really want things to work out between us, and I really want her to trust me again. I couldn't imagine what kind of hell it would be to be without her. I think about her all of the time. I also really hope that she likes the Christmas present I got her. I know it's after Christmas, but she doesn't want me to give it to her until she has something for me. There's really only one thing that scares me more than anything right now, and that is to lose her. I fear that all of the time. I want to show her how much she really means to me, but I don't know how to do it. There is so much doubt in her heart, that I want to clear out for her so she can be happy with me. I love my J.J.S. so much. HER AND ONLY HER HAVE ALL OF MY HEART. I LOVE HER SO MUCH. I love you Jessica, more than anything, and more than you know. <3 <3 <3"

"event","What's up everybody? It's been a long time since my last entry. Everything has gotten a lot better for me. I've got myself a great girlfriend. We've been going out for over three and a half months now. Right now she's out of town visiting some family for Christmas. I've also started some new martial arts training, I've gotten a lot better too. I've been working on my swordsmanship on and off. I've also recently gotten into a new anime, that started on adult swim a few weeks ago, called ""Full Metal Alchemist."" It's really awesome, but it can also get really depressing at times too. I'm still doing the show choir thing. I'm really looking foward to this year's competition season. It's looking a lot better than last year. I've clear up a lot of the emotional messes that came up last year and this year's show is a lot better if we pull it off well. Well, that's all I can think of to say for now. Later!"

"event","Well, somehow Ryan beat me to the ""sky. I don't understand how anyone could ever see Ryan as him. Just because he has a nearly endless hunger doesn't make him the ""sky"". You also need the heart and personality of the ""sky"" to carry on it's power. The more and more we hung out, the more and more i saw the ""sky"" darken. I am the true ""sky"" and I have always been but the blindness of people disables there ability to see the truth. I know that something wrong has occured. Just because someone else has the title of the ""sky"" doesn't mea they have taken it from me. It still lives in my soul and Ryan has to kill me if he truely wishes to claim the title he does not deserve. Clouds are moving in and the sky is darkening. A storm is brewing and it will not end peacefully. The world is BLIND."

"event","""The abilities of a great fighter can not be bound by the laws of physics. A true warrior will push their limits as far as the mind can go. A fighter doesn't only live for the fight, but for those in which a protects and loves. And a true warrior does not need great strength to be powerful, but a heart that is pure and innocent. When one reaches such purity their power and strength will have no limits.""-Michael Burnette"

"event","I wish I could be like Goku because he is an outstanding fighter. He is the true embodiment of courage, power, strength, honor, determination, grit, joy, and innocence. He is always up for a challenge, even if his chances are poor. He has a calm, joyful personality, but he is always serious when the time calls. At times, he can be threatening and powerful, but at the same time he wouldn't hurt a fly.

He is what we should all try to be."

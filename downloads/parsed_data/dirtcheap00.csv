"event","Too much has happened lately im not going to explain it. Me and Nathan barely talk now, its weird.  I can't wait to be home in like 10 days, its going to be relieving. I'm so excited to see Jerica, its going to be the best. Nathan, my friend from florida, and I have been talking a lot again and I'm excited to see him and everyone else. I hope everything goes okay when I see Erik, but I'm sure it will. I control that, and hopefully I won't start fucking crying the minute I see him again. I feel like I'm over it, but you never know. 

I always wonder who reads this shit, I'm pretty sure its just Jerica and Erik barely, but idk. 

Oh, I already celebrated christmas, I finally got another iPod.

Since Nathan cheated on me I haven't even wanted to look at another guy, let alone do anything with them. Idk how I feel about it. Kailey like won't even talk to me anymore, I don't know what the fuck happened. I think she got scared because we were always together and it felt like people knew, and idk. I don't give a fuck but she does. We were at some college party once and we went to the bathroom then before we left we like started kissing and some kid walked in and ever since she hasn't kissed me. Its all so confusing I don't even want to care but I do. I think Kaileys the only friend of mine I've ever been attracted to.. I think thats weird too. Everythings fucking weird with her. I just want some to love me, I know I can't push it and I don't even want to have a sexual relationship with anyone at all, I used to be able to like fuck or anything at any time but like theres no way I could even kiss another guy."

"event","being back from new york is nice, but i miss nathan sooo much. I hate this feeling, i just want everything to be happy and good, not sad. It was weird because me and erik talked for a few days when i was there then now i probably won't talk to him for a while. i dont know why lol its weird. it really bothers nathan when me and erik talk so much but he doesnt say anything and i appreciate that. I apprectiate that he understands and im glad nathan and i arent doing the whole jealousy thing.

"event","Kailey and I are always really nervous when were sober, but then when we get drunk we aren't. Like we have to be drunk to kiss and shit but last night we like talked about it when we were drunk and idk it was weird. We both want the same thing, but its new for both of us so idk its hard. Its almost like going back to your first boyfriend and feeling like those kind of nerves and being that unsure. We were at Shane's house and we were like being completely obvious about it around like 3 other drunk people, leo, neil, and ryan, like idk, it was obvious. Then Roger walked in the door right when we were leaving cause i had a headache and he wanted us to stay but i was like i really need to leave, everyones being so loud and i dont feel good. then idk he just like pulled out of his ass that me and kailey just wanted to go home so we could hook up and we were like so astonished he knew that. ofcourse we denied it and shit, but idk its fucking weird how he knew. 

Anyways, I dont know how to feel. And i dont want to call you and talk to you about it jerica, cause idk its an awkward thing for me lol. I do like being with a girl more than a guy, cause idk its nice. I'm nervous to like go further than kissing though..."

"event","I think I might really have a problem here. I'm trying, so hard. I wonder how much you still think about me, I wonder if you actually do miss me, I wonder if you want anything to do with me, I wonder if you secretly wan't it back just as much as i do. You have no clue what I would do. 

Nathan isn't working, and never will work. 
Weed isn't working, and never will work.
I'm not working, and never will work.

Every post I do now I'm going to write old memories. Maybe if I get them all down I won't miss my past so much. And I'm going to do present memories so maybe I can start liking my present a little more.

THEN- 

1.) My very first concert, on my birthday with Jerica, and getting Norma Jean's guitar pick. Some kid sat next to Jerica and I and gave us gum. The ride home smelled like old car and pear secret deodorant that we both used at the time, and everytime I smell that smell it reminds me of me and Jerica going to shows.

2.) The first time I met Erik, and I decided I liked him. We were at Burger King and I think he wanted me to buy him something and he wouldnt let me pee until I agreed so he followed me into the girls bathroom, and I agreed so he would just get out and let me pee. haha

3.) Going to the park with Jerica and acting like straight up retards.

NOW-

1.) Getting my septum pierced my Morgan. It was the first time I went to his house, and I was so nervous cause he was like the first person I hungout with here, except for like a major geek. It was so awkward because we didn't really know eachother, but it didn't take long until we were comfortable. We were both so nervous to do it, that it took him like an hour before he finally pierced it. After we went to the movies with a bunch of people and I met a lot of new people. Those are all the people I'm friends with now pretty much.

2.) Doing ex with Kailey and Kenzie, and having one of the best nights of my life just driving around and stopping at every gas station and grocery store for more to drink or to piss, the whole entire night, until about 5am. 

3.) Going to my first hookah bar with Jeremy, Kenzie, and some other random people and it not being anything I expected. It was really chill and everyone was just sitting at their tables talking. I drove, and hit some lady's car, but there wasn't a mark so she didn't care."

I feel like a broken record, and I'm afraid thats how I'm always going to be. When will I get over you? When will I not cry when I look at your myspace and think how perfect you are?

I miss you again
right when everything gets good again the thought of you ruins my whole day just because im not with you, just because you don't love me. I think about how much you meant/mean to me, all the things we did; good and bad. I remember everything except how it feels when you say I love you too. I just want to hear you say it. I just want you to tell me everything will work out between us and that you'll always be there. Its been so long, and I still cry about things. I still wish more than anything I could have you back. I still cuddle with the bear we ""made"" together because theres still a little piece of you left. I miss you."

"event","Well I decided to play basketball.. and I'm extremely nervous. I got my physical yesterday and I'm going to a parent meeting thing with my mom tomorrow. I still work at Chandra's, as much as I hate it. I am trying to get a job at Nova, a restaurant right across the street from Chandra's. Hopefully it works out, but if not then theres a reason for that. School is over for me, and I am happy about it, but I also know I'm going to be super lonely and bored.

Ryan, the 27 year old guy I work with at Chandra's, and I decided Bo is a complete weirdo, and I'm completely done with him. I deleted him from my phone and everything. He isn't completely a weirdo, but he is a pathological liar. He makes so much up, you really can't even say you know him in the least bit. I was just going to be friends with him and deal with it, because he really is a really fun guy when hes not being an asshole, but Ryan really made it clear to me that I don't want to be friends with someone like that. 

I got really high last night, and I know I'm not normal. I just know it. Its so hard to explain how I think, but last night when I was high it really made me realize how different I am. I don't want to smoke anymore, but then I do. I want to write when I'm high or something so I can maybe make sense of my feelings or thoughts. When I'm high I don't hold anything back, or think about things or second guess them. 

I am still trying to figure my way in this world and where I want to go. Everything looks so good, I can just look at something and say ""Thats what I want to do."" There are so many things I want to do, but I have to decide what I like to do, what makes me happy.. not what other people have found success in. I like to play basketball. I like to eat and cook. I like to read good books. I like to shop. I like to travel. I like to listen to good music. I like to think about and analyze the world, our surroundings, human behavior, and my thoughts on things. I like to paint and draw when I do good. Mostly, I like to be wrapped up in someone else. 

I love One Tree Hill, it makes me so happy. I like the last season because I really could relate to Peyton. I watch the shows over and over again and, sadly, I cry with her. When she thinks of Luke, I think of Erik. When she feels lost or confused, like she did in the beginning of the season, I feel like someone else is feeling the same as I do. I also relate to Nathan, how hes trying to make a come back in basketball.. so am I. I feel like whatever happens in the next season is how my life will layout. Maybe Peyton and Luke will get back together, or maybe Peyton  will find someone new, or continue to be alone. Maybe Nathan will bet back into basketball, or he will fail completely. Either way I feel like my life will follow along with theres for some reason. Maybe that is what will screw me up, and my sub-conscience will make what happens in the show happen in my life whether or not its what I really want. But then what is it I really want?"

"event","I am so unhappy.
I don't even want to be alive anymore, its not worth it.
I'm not even exaggerating, thats how unhappy I am.
I need someone, just one person.
Please, I need someone.

I can't do this on my own, and I don't know why.
I've been looking stuff up and I think I have borderline personality disorder...



borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness characterized by pervasive instability in moods, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behavior. This instability often disrupts family and work life, long-term planning, and the individual's sense of self-identity. Originally thought to be at the ""borderline"" of psychosis, people with BPD suffer from a disorder of emotion regulation. While less well known than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), BPD is more common, affecting 2 percent of adults, mostly young women.1 There is a high rate of self-injury without suicide intent, as well as a significant rate of suicide attempts and completed suicide in severe cases.2,3 Patients often need extensive mental health services, and account for 20 percent of psychiatric hospitalizations.4 Yet, with help, many improve over time and are eventually able to lead productive lives.
Symptoms

While a person with depression or bipolar disorder typically endures the same mood for weeks, a person with BPD may experience intense bouts of anger, depression, and anxiety that may last only hours, or at most a day.5 These may be associated with episodes of impulsive aggression, self-injury, and drug or alcohol abuse. Distortions in cognition and sense of self can lead to frequent changes in long-term goals, career plans, jobs, friendships, gender identity, and values. Sometimes people with BPD view themselves as fundamentally bad, or unworthy. They may feel unfairly misunderstood or mistreated, bored, empty, and have little idea who they are. Such symptoms are most acute when people with BPD feel isolated and lacking in social support, and may result in frantic efforts to avoid being alone.

People with BPD often have highly unstable patterns of social relationships. While they can develop intense but stormy attachments, their attitudes towards family, friends, and loved ones may suddenly shift from idealization (great admiration and love) to devaluation (intense anger and dislike). Thus, they may form an immediate attachment and idealize the other person, but when a slight separation or conflict occurs, they switch unexpectedly to the other extreme and angrily accuse the other person of not caring for them at all. Even with family members, individuals with BPD are highly sensitive to rejection, reacting with anger and distress to such mild separations as a vacation, a business trip, or a sudden change in plans. These fears of abandonment seem to be related to difficulties feeling emotionally connected to important persons when they are physically absent, leaving the individual with BPD feeling lost and perhaps worthless. Suicide threats and attempts may occur along with anger at perceived abandonment and disappointments.

People with BPD exhibit other impulsive behaviors, such as excessive spending, binge eating and risky sex. BPD often occurs together with other psychiatric problems, particularly bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and other personality disorders."

"event","I'm finally starting to get over Erik. Like of course I'm not fully over him but I'm accepting things a lot easier. Last night him and I were talking about when I come down and stuff, and I fully accepted the fact that him and I would just be friends while I'm there. I'm actually kind of more excited about that because I know we'll have more fun that way. He's getting his license too so it should be easier for us to hangout, unless he doesn't have a car by the time I come. 

I miss Jerica, cause we haven't talked much in the past couple of weeks. But I have been extremely busy and when I'm not busy I'm stressed and in a bad mood. 

I met this new guy named Bo, and hes really cool. Him and I get along really good, and hes not boring at all. Its tight cause I don't really have many friends that I hangout with much anymore.

I can't go to Seventh Dagger Fest :[ of course I don't have a ride, because I don't have friends. I used to take everyone to shows, whenever, but noo they can't take me to any. So when I get my license back and they want to go to shows with me, I'm just going to laugh and be like fuck you. 
I was really really looking forward to going to seventh dagger too. My favorite band is playing, and I really like toughguy straightedge music now."

and you're still gone
I will wish that you were here..
and now I close my eyes
ask myself why?
why did you disapear?

summer seasons come and gone
now the leaves fall from the trees
and like the branches my hearts barren,
your voice echoes in the breeze.
so winter's yet to come
my hopes are numb

and as winter nears
only to feed my fears
it feels colder than before..

where are you now?
where have you gone?
are you ever coming back
is this your way of moving on?
look into my eyes
you will find what you're searching for
you will raise again in me she said
of the fire that burns forever more

I search under the stars
for the burning light that sparked your love for me
sky's as empty as this street
unanswered prayer, another solitic need?

where are you now?
where have you gone?
are you ever coming back?
is this your way of moving on?
was it something i said?
was it something i didn't say?
do the words i left unspoken,
still keep you away?

I'm learning quickly, so I'm pretty sure I'll have everything down in a month or shorter. I just need to hurry up and figure things out so then I can find a friend or someone else to be a server so I can leave for a couple weeks this summer. Today she told me if things stay the way they are right now that I can not leave at all over summer, because I'll need to work. But if its going to be that bad then I'm going to get sick of working there anyways, so I really need to get friends to work there or something. Joe was supposed to work as a dishwasher but after twenty minutes he left. Brandon was also supposed to be a dishwasher but she didn't like him after a day.

I realized how easy it is to be deceived and lied to. Most of all I realized Erik is really over me, hes not halfway over me, hes not pretending, he really is, and I have to respect it.

I also realized how much I don't belong in this world.

Duane didn't have to leave when i thought he was like 5 or 6 days ago.
He stayed and planned on going back tomorrow but I'm not sure if thats even going to happen.
We've hungout a few times since the last time, and I'm going to miss him so much when hes gone.
We had sex last night, without a condom, without birth control, and he came in me. I wasn't even drunk, I don't know what I was thinking. But it felt really right, then we just went to sleep, and I've never been so comfortable in anyones arms before, not even Erik's. It was extremely weird. I know hes a player, I know hes 21, I know hes going back to Atl eventually, I know nothing will ever happen, but I still can't help myself from feeling the way I do. I don't even know what that is. I can't wait for a week to pass so I can get a pregnancy test. I have a feeling everything will be okay so I'm not like freaking out. How funny would it be if I, of all people, got pregnant. I think girls who get pregnant are fucking retarded."

"event","The Broken clock is a comfort
It helps me sleep tonight
Maybe it can stop tomorrow
From stealing all my time
And I am here still waiting
Though I still have my doubts
I am damaged at best
Like you've already figured out

I'm falling apart
I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart
That's still beating
In the pain
There is healing
In your name
I find meaning
So I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

The broken locks were a warning
You got inside my head
I tried my best to be guarded
I'm an open book instead
And I still see your reflection
Inside of my eyes
That are looking for purpose
They're still looking for life

I'm falling apart
I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart
That's still beating
In the pain
Is there healing
In your name
I find meaning
So I'm holding on
I'm barely holding on to you

I'm hanging on another day
Just to see what, you will throw my way
And I'm hanging on, to the words you say
You said that I will, will be okay
The broken light on the freeway
Left me here alone
I may have lost my way now
But I haven't forgotten my way home

I'm falling apart
I'm barely breathing
With a broken heart
That's still beating
In the pain
There is healing
In your name
I find meaning
So I'm holding on
Barely holding on to you
Barely holdin on to you



I don't think anyone understands how I feel. I sit here and I get all depressed over one thing. It doesn't matter if I go out, if I sit at home, if I'm with my friends or not, you don't ever leave my mind. Sometimes its hard to remember the feel of you or the details of your face, but other times I can remember exactly how you felt and every intricate detail of your face. I know that if I still lived in Florida it would work, but by the time I'm able to go it might be too late..



A strangled smile fell from your face
It kills me that I hurt you this way
The worst part is that I didn't even know
Now there's a million reasons for you to go
But if you can find a reason to stay

I'll do whatever it takes
To turn this around
I know what's at stake
I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance
Believe that I can change
I'll keep us together whatever it takes

I'll do whatever it takes
To turn this around
I know what's at stake
I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance
And give me a break
I'll keep us together, I know you deserve much better

But remember the time I told you the way that I felt
That I'd be lost without you and never find myself
Let's hold onto each other above everything else
Start over, start over

I'll do whatever it takes
To turn this around
I know what's at stake
I know I've let you down
And if you give me a chance
and believe that I can change
I'll keep us together whatever it takes"

"event","I started crying yesterday because of you. I couldn't stop thinking about old times and I really miss the stupidest thing ever. I miss when you used to sniff my face like a dog. I miss it so much, and no one else could do it like you did. I don't think anyone could be as good as you are. Its like I change day to day, but its because I WANT to be over you and not want you, but then I KNOW in my heart that that will never happen. So somedays I try to pretend to get over you, but I'm not you, I can't just pretend something and it be okay. I'm just hoping that one day you'll pop out of the computer screen and tell me you feel the same way. 

I love my new job at Chandra's Bistro. It's not easy, and thats why I like it. I worked my ass off last night, carrying things, doing dishes, and scrubbing pots and pans, and I actually really liked it. The only thing I don't like is I had to like try to understand them cause they all have really heavy accents. We went to a movie after and it was pretty fun. One of the guys like asked me out, it was awkward, hes fucking 25. Of course I said no. The movie was reaaally good, its like one of my favorites, 21."

I work today at Dominos, tomorrow at Chantra's, and Sunday at Dominos.
I just want one more job so I can quit Dominos.
When I work at Dominos, I only stay for like 3 hours, and thats only like 20 bucks.
i def should be able to get another one this summer, but I'm happy for now because now I have two jobs.

eeeeekk
I can't wait for summer :]
It's coming so fast that I'm going to be shocked when its finally here.

I miss Florida, but it doesn't feel like it has been almost a year."

"event","I read a whole book today, did all my homework, watched a movie, ate, and socialized today.
Thats a lot for me, considering the past week minus yesterday. I wasnt even eating for a while, just drinking green tea. I realized with everything I do I'm never satisfied with myself, I'm never good enough for myself.
Things I'm good at, I honestly don't see it because I'm so worried about being better. 
I think I need to just slow down and chill. 
I'm 16

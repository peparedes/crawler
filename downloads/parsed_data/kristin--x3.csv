Cover up or spread it out
Turn around had enough
Pick and choose or pass it on
Buying in heading for

It's bad enough, I want the fear
Need the fear cause he's alone
And he has become

Well if they're making it, making it
Then they're pushing it, pushing it

All the screaming fits, screaming fits

After all, what's the point
Course levitation is possible
If you're a fly, achieved and gone
There's time for this and so much more

A special place of my design
To never cope or never care
Just use the key cause he's alone

"event","Sally-Anne was heading toward the Great Hall to meet Parvati for their all-girl evening. Her excitement had pushed her to leave a bit early, so Sally knew she would have to wait, but she didn't mind. She finally reached the double doors and leaned against the wall as she waited for her friend to join her. This was exactly what she needed. A trouble-free night.

"event","Friday. Finally! 

This week has been a total nightmare. 
So much work. But at least I've cleared my most schedule for the weekend, right? 

If anyone wants to do something, I'll be in the Common Room. 


<lj-cut text=""Owl to Sara Sanders"">
Hello Sara, 
Here's the book I talked to you about. Sorry it took so long, but I had a little problem locating it. ;) 

Enjoy, 
Sally-Anne </lj-cut>"

"event","Sally-Anne was walking back from the Great Hall. Dinner was nearly over and, as usual, she left early to avoid the buzz of students heading back to their common room. She pulled out a small piece of parchment from her school back and scanned it quickly.


<u><i>TO DO LIST</u>

Owl Mum & Dad about grades
Write Astronomy essay on the effect of Venus on people born in February
Finish reviewing DADA notes
Read chapter 12 for Herbology

Talk to 5 new students to prove Jake wrong</i>


She heaved a long sigh as she stuffed her list back in her schoolbag. It was going to be a long and tedious evening. <i>I'll owl Mum and Dad first, then do all my homework. If I have time, I'll go socialize,</i> she resumed to herself, counting with her fingers as she enumerated her tasks. 

Sally rarely paid attention to her surroundings, especially not when she was thinking (she was quite pitiable at multitasking). As she was lost in her thoughts, she didn't notice the person who was approaching down the hall until their shoulders collided.

""Oh, sorry,"" the Hufflepuff replied, her cheeks flushing slightly. 

<small>OOC: Befriend her, talk to her, stuff her in a cupboard... it is as you wish. ;)</small>"

"event","Ummm.

It seems there are more Slytherins complaining about everyone else complaining than actual people who are complaining.

So in their quest to stop all the whining, they are only increasing it.
Doesn't seem very logical to me."

"event","Merlin I hate winter!
I mean truly, completely, absolutely loathe it.

It's cold and wet. Snow get in <i>everywhere</i>. The wind burns your face. No matter how many pairs of sock you wear, your feet are still soaking wet every time you step outside. It's dark before dinner. Everything is dead and boring.

But what I despise most of all about winter is the ice. 
It's slippery and hard and invisible. 

I cannot wait for spring."

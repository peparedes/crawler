"event","I've decided that I reeeeaaaaally need to start drawing more often and brush up on my skillz. So, I've decided to do this little project, but I need your help:

- Pick up to five of your 'interests' (or mine, if you don't have any) from your profile page and I'll draw them- or my interpretation of them. 
- I'm going to try to post at least one each day as soon as I get started.
- Please have patience, especially if I get a large response, I may get back logged
- Don't expect master pieces, but do expect to be tagged in the picture that you requested. 
- Feel free to do it more than once, but keep each set to five or under as I'm going to try to do them in sets. 
- I won't ignore repeats, so if more than one person request the same 'interest' I'll do two pictures in different sets.

That's about it for my great idea. It's open to everyone, be creative! <3"

"event","The first five (5) people to respond to this post will get something made by me.

This offer does have some restrictions and limitations:

- I make no guarantees that you will like what I make.
- What I create will be just for you.
- It'll be done this year (2009).
- You have no clue what it's going to be. It may be a mix CD. It may be a poem. I may draw or paint something. I might bake you something and mail it to you. Who knows? Not you, that's for sure! [not me either]
- I reserve the right to do something extremely strange.

The catch is that you have to put this in your journal as well, if you expect me to do something for you. (This isn't really necessary, but cool if you do it!)"

"event","I stayed home from work today because the weather was gross this morning and I've been hacking like a rusty chainsaw. Pleasant! And now I'm sitting here trying to get the motivation to start sketching for this poster I said I'd do for a girl I work with. An even called 'The Not So Serious Side of Sex' for the Halifax Sexual Health Centre (formerly Planned Parenthood). It's not that I don't want to do the poster, it's just... I'm lazy and am seriously lacking motivation. And the sporadic coughing until I see spots and want to vomit isn't helping much.

I thought I was going to have this crazy busy rushed weekend as I was supposed to do stuff with about five or six different friends. I mostly bailed on all of those plans. I feel kinda bad, but the staying in my pjs doing nothing-ness of yesterday was kind of nice. Though, it also makes me want to do the same thing today. Even though I'm not in my pjs. I even showered today! heh.

I think next weekend we're going to see My Bloody Valentine in 3-D. Apparently the original was set and filmed in Cape Bretton, which is kinda cool. Took place in the Sydney Mines, but I guess the re-make is completely Americanized, no longer set in Nova Scotia at all, which kinda makes me sad. I'm not entirely sure why they had to change that- I guess Nova Scotia just isn't cool enough for Hollywood. 

Gah... as much as I should be posting more often, I really need to stop this procrastination.... even if I kinda just want to nap right now.... NO! I'm going to go grab a sketchbook and find some pencils and just get it DONE! Not that I need to have the poster completed today- just some preliminary idea sketches. That I was supposed to have done and sent at ten this morning... oops...

Ok, really going now. Maybe I'll just draw some sex toys..."

Also, since I'm lazy and already have the pictures uploaded to FaceBook (yea, yea, I'm TRYING to stay away but it's too damn convenient for picture uploads), here is the link the the album:

<a href=http://www.new.facebook.com/album.php?aid=157769&l=ba69d&id=522660525>Peeeektures!</a>

It's in that sore please-do-not-touch kinda phase. I'm not looking forward to the itchy phase, but it will be totally worth it in the end once it's all healed. Yay for fresh ink!

That's pretty much all the news I have for now... other than work and the upcoming move, there hasn't been a whole lot of time for anything else...

Oh! We celebrated Lynsey's birthday on Saturday. We took her to Build A Bear and she made a moose named (a)Nonny Moose. :) Then we went to East Side Mario's for dinner, to Future Shop so Lynsey could pick up... something... I can't remember. A movie of some sort. Then back to Lynsey's to watch Trailer Park Boys and some Blue Collar Comedy! It was a good night, and I think we helped in keeping her mind off of not getting to be with James on her birthday. 

15 days til we move!"

I'm just about ready to go to bed since I'm working 7-3 this week- meaning I have to be up around 5:30ish. And I need to shower in the morning. So this will be brief.

I got new metal! YAY! Kelta, Chris and I went out to Nicole's place on Sunday to get cheap ass piercings as Nicole is just apprenticing right now. I got a snake bite and, since she couldn't decide on what she wanted, so did Kelta. :) Chris got his eyebrow done. Here's my new face metal:

Went for a walk in the park after work with Richard, Lynsey and James. It was really nice out and we saw, like, seventy billion squirrels running around. I took lots of pictures which I will upload soon(ish).

Tomorrow is derby practice and I can't wait. It was canceled on Sunday cos it was supposed to rain, then it was effing beautiful so I was angry. It better stay nice out tomorrow! I want to skate!!!

Sunday was my first derby practice on the season. It was pretty amazing to get out on my skates. I'm hoping that it won't rain this weekend so I can get out again. Stupid working nights, I would have loved to have gone to practice last night, too, but no luck. 

I've been re-reading Clara Callan recently. I love the diary/letter style of writing so much, and this is probably one of my favorite novels anyhow. It really makes me want to get back into the habit of writing more often. Especially letters. The kind you have to mail with a stamp, not a click. Anyone want a letter?"

I'm still alive, still working, eating, breathing. 
Still with Richard, still living in Halifax. 
Not a lot has changed, really.

I'm going to make an effort to start updating here more often. 
I have to wonder, though, after cleaning up all of the deleted journals from my friends list, who's still here? And,of who is left around, do any of them care about or even read this? Especially after such an absence and infrequent posting. 

Ah well, I'm hoping to relearn the joys of Live Journal and maybe find a home here again. I find Face Book, while convenient for finding people and catching up with those I've lost touch with, a bit impersonal and at times down right depressing. I miss the familiarity and closeness of good ole LJ.

"event","Gah, look at me... over three weeks have gone by without an update. I am seriously slacking on the LiveJournal front... 

My apologies.

The most excitement I've had recently was Morgan (<lj user=realitystylist> coming to visit. Sadly, I didnt get to see him much what with working and junk. I feel bad about that- I wasn't a very good hostess... It also would have been better if I wasn't under so much random stress lately, I wasn't really myself while he was here. Sorry Morgan!

So, yesterday at work, we were all out in the smoking section (which is in a parking lot...) and this random guy wanders over and starts asking us if we've heard of ""those indian cigarettes"". We all play dumb, of course, and Theresa even goes as far as to say ""no, I don't smoke those, they're illegal""- which made me giggle... Anyhow, he then tried to sell us some and kept asking if we wanted to try it. Seriously, it felt like those comercials where you see the tough older kids trying to push drugs on the younger kids... We figured he was an undercover trying to bust us. We weren't going to have any of that, tho, we're smart! :) All in all it was an odd and amusing, if slightly creepy, experience. 

I'm getting a new phone on Monday. It's my moms- she got herself added to my account and got a new phone (the EXACT phone I had wanted but couldnt afford because I am under contract still and would have to buy it outright). She was thinking about it, I guess, and has decided that it's too high tech and has way more features than she needs- it has an MP3 player in it and all this other goodness that I was drooling over when I was planing on buying it. So, on Monday since I'm off work, she's going to come in and we're going to go to Telus to get them to swap the phones- she'll take mine, even tho it kinda sucks. I love my mommy!

I saw some of the buskers the other night with Richard. It was ok, but not as good as last year. One neat thing we did, though, was get our hands cast in wax. I think it's really neat. It's of Richard and I holding hands (tho you cant tell whos hand belongs to who since mine are so effing big) and then got it colored orange and blue since those are mine and his favorite colors :) It felt really weird to get done, but I liked it.

I'm going to a wedding on Saturday. An old friend of Richard's is getting married, should be fun. They're having the ceremony in Point Pleasant Park- hopefully it won't rain! I dont know if they have a contingency plan or not... I havent been to a wedding since last summer when I went to two within two weeks of eachother! Should be good fun, tho, I like weddings...

I'll make an effort to update more often- I'm sure you all miss me desperately! :) Oh, and maybe I'll even upload some pictures of the buskers next time... I took a few, but not many as it was a bit rainy (well, misty with a few drops) and I didn't want to get my moms camera wet..."

"event","Ok, so it's been about a million years since I've posted, and I apologize. I dont really have any excuse other than I havent really had anything to post about. Tho that isnt really an excuse as I have quite often posted about nothing at all. 

Things are alright, I suppose. I've been stressing about money hardcore, but that happens when you're basicly unemployed. Things have pretty much worked themselves out, though, and in theory I should be back to work soon. I've even had a couple of job interviews else where. No call backs yet, but with a little luck I wont have to go back to the call centre. 

Things with Richard are fantastic. We've been together six months now, which is exciting. I'm moving in with him and his current roommates in September. I'm looking forward to it- the chicks he lives with are pretty cool and I'm rather excited about living with him. 

Last weekend I got to go see my Wanda for her birthday weekend. It was exciting as I hadnt seen her since her wedding last summer. I miss her bunches and it was good to spend some time with my Babu again. I even got to spend some quality time with Comander Bunbun, who is very soft and quite friendly. Tho you have to be careful she doesnt poo on you. 

In theory, I should be updating more. I would like to. I miss the world of LJ. Facebook has kind of taken me over, though. If anyone wants to add me, I'm on there as April Nicole. Oh, and I've decided that when I write in this journal from now on, I'm writing for me, not for anyone else. All this really means is that I'm not going to explain things/people. If you want to know, ask and I'll probably answer. It's just, instead of writing things like ""Me and Mealnie, my sister, and her sister in law Sherry..."" I'll simply be writing ""Me, Mel and Sherry..."" And that was purely an example, I rarely spend time with Mel and Sherry, but they were the first people I could think of....

Anyhow, yea, I'm alive, generally happy, and should be seen slightly more frequently."

"event","So, many of you know that I had lost my kitten, Odette, a while ago. I was very upset that she had gone and held out hope for a long time that I would find her. Well, I had just recently come to terms with the fact that I would not likely see her again and was able to let go, as sappy as that sounds. I still have Lulu and I love her to pieces. 

The thing is, a couple of days ago when I was coming up the stairs to my apartment, I saw a kitten laying in my neighbours window that looked a lot like Odette. I passed it off as coincidence as I had been thinking about her that day. But today, I saw her again. And when she saw me she started to cry and meow. The lady that lived there came to the window and I told her that I thought Odette was my cat. The lady got rather defensive and told me that I was wrong, she's had 'Kali' since she was a baby kitten. 

I couldnt believe it. Just when I've let go and given up I see my kittie again. Except I cant touch her or pet her or ever have her back. This is the same kitten that I held in my arms and sobbed over because she had a fucking cold. It isnt fair. I mean, I'm thankful that she's ok and that she's fed and loved, but she's mine. I miss her, so does Lulu.

I've been stressing a lot about money lately. Not working and having to wait a million years for EI to start is not a happy prospect. I have an appointment with my surgeon next week so I'm going to ask if I can go back to work sooner rather than wait another three or four weeks. I need the money now-ish. Currently, I have enough to pay my rent for April and nothing else. No bus pass, no phone bill, no groceries, nothing. And if I dont go back to work asap, I wont be able to pay rent for May or do anything else for that month, either. If I cant go back to work, drastic measures may have to be taken. I'll have to go find a pimp or something. 

Anyhow, I'm alive and feeling pretty good. My back feels fine and I'm starting to get bored of not working. Hopefully that will change soon."

"event","When I checked my email today I saw that I had gotten a nudge here at good ole El Jay stating that I havent updated in seven weeks. I cant believe that it has been that long! I do apologize to those that had missed me, and to those who hadn't, well I guess it didnt matter too much to you one way or the other. :P

So, I could lay the blame of me not updating on work or being busy or what have you, but I think the main thing is that I'm lazy. It's true that I had been spending most of my time at work or with my boyfriend (ok, all of my time...), but I could have updated if I had wanted to and, for whatever reasons, I hadnt. But I am now, so yay for that. 

And now that I'll be off of work for, oh, the next six weeks or so, I'll have the time to update more often. Yep, I'm on a medical leave of absence due to having surgery done on my back. I had a disc removed and was in hospital for a week. Which I could use as another excuse as to why I havent made any recent updates. :) 

I'm doing well now, recovering and what not. I've been sleeping a lot, but have gotten quite a bit of my mobility back already, which is exciting. I have a walker, which is super annoying and I hate it, but I've been using less and less of it and (hopefully) soon wont need it at all. 

In other news, well, there isnt really any other news. Aside from my super fun trip to the emergency room resulting in me getting cut open and laid up for a week, life has been pretty routine. Work, eat, sleep, boyfriend. That's about it. 

Like I said, now that I'm off I may be updating more frequently. I'll be staying with some friends for a while in Dartmouth so I dont know how often, but I'll have my own little computer there with me and an internet connection. You'll be hearing from me again, dont worry! :D

Oh, and Robyn, I did get the flowers!  I was sad that I had missed your visit, but they made me happy the whole time I was in the hospital! They were beautiful- and some of them are still surviving! :D"

I am currently sitting at the dining room table at my sisters house, grooving to tunes on my new mp3 player from my folks and watching mom and Mel organizing the gifts back under the tree. The house smells like turkey and tree and the kids are playing with their new treasures. I'm glad I got to come home for Christmas, I've been missing my family something terrible. 
I did pretty well with gifts this year- giving and receiving. I love the stuff I got and people seemed pleased with what I gave them. Melanie loved her martini set especially- she said it was the best thing she got this year! heh... I like giving good gifts, it makes me happy to make others happy. 
Speaking of making others happy, Richard rather enjoyed his gifts... both of them. :) I got him a cigarette tin with his nick name (Flatz) engraved on it. He said it was beautiful. I also spent a bit of money at La Senza (a lingere store), which he also enjoyed... hehehe... 
So, all in all a good Christmas. I'll be happy when I get back to the city, though. I miss my apartment and my man and my city already. I dont think I could ever live anywhere but a city now. I love my sister and love visiting her, but I don't think I'd survive in a suburb...

I had a really great day today. I woke up early (on my day off and everything!) but I got to wake up next to a fantastic boy, so it wasn't so bad. Anyhow, I got up, got on the bus with my man, he got off at his apartment as he had to work today, but I continued on to the downtown area. I made my way to the Neptune Theater as Sara was doing her end of term performance/evaluation for the theaterschool today. I got there a bit early and got to talk to her singing instructor. He was cool, we chatted about preforming and how he couldn't wait to see how they were doing in other aspects of their learning. I got a call from Pam, who was going to watch as well, so I went to meet her and brought her to were the performance was. The performance was really cool, and made me super jealous. I want to preform damnit! They were all fantastic and I had a blast. After the performance was done, Sara had to do evaluations and such, so Pam and I left. We walked to Spring Garden, jumping in puddles and laughing a bunch on the way. Then Pam bought a Prime Time and we proceeded to wait for the bus. I got on the bus and made my way home. I did my dishes, ate way too much food and just kind of chilled in my empty apartment for the afternoon. 

And tomorrow I'm going to finish up my holiday shopping with my sister, Pam and Peter, a friend from work. That means another day of getting up early. It'll kinda suck, but I'm looking forward to a day of shopping with Mel. I haven't seen her in a while, it'll be fun. I only have mostly family left to buy for. Family, Apollo and Richard. I think I kind of know what I'm getting most people, I just need to actually *get* them. Ooo, I love shopping!"

I had a fantastic night last night, for the most part, and I will update about it later. I dont have the drive do to it right now.
I've cleaned up my fiends list a bit. Nothing drastic, just people I really didnt talk to as much any more, of if I ever really did, I dont know. 
Alright, I think I'm going to nap."

"event","It isn't a fun thing to be in. I was for a while yesterday. This is why:

I went to work as usual in the morning. When I got to work I wasnt feeling very well. It was the kind of ill that you could justify going home early but could probably stick out the day. I opted to go home. I got on my bus ans headed out. While on the bus, I decided that I wanted to see the whole rout of the 52. I knew it went to Burnside and I like going over the bridge, so I went. We got to Dartmouth and all was fine. We got to the Highfeild Terminal and stopped a moment. I sat there thinking, ""This is Highfield Park. People say that bad things happen here. Seems pretty quiet to me."" As soon as this thought was out of my head, from behind the bus comes a van, swerving, and it crashes into a chainlink fence with a concrete base. There was a man sitting at the base of the fence and I dont know how, but when the van hit, the man that was sitting there went from by the fence to the lawn of the apartment building that the fence was around. I couldnt move. I didnt call 911 or get up to see if he was ok, but several people on the bus did both so it was ok. I didnt even move to get off the bus when it started on its way again, going back to the bus garage. When we got there, the man that was driving (not the regular driver because he was still at the accident site, but another Metro Transit driver) told me that he had to take the bus back to the scene so he would drop me off there. I got back and had to walk from Highfield to the Ferry Terminal (it took about an hour or so) and then take the Ferry back to Halifax, and then a bus home. I know that I wasnt really involved in the accident, but it took a toll on me. I dont want to sound melodramtic, but I was in serious shock until I managed to call my sister and tell her what happened- then I started to bawl. I now get little anxiety attacks when I hear sirens. There were two major things that really stuck with me: 

1.) The driver was drunk. Very drunk. And he tried to run away. He was dragged back to the scene by someone at the apartment building. I saw him get arrested, so I guess that was a good thing. But he was fucking wasted. 

2.) There was a group of kids (aged 12-15, kids to me) not five feet from where he crashed. He could have killed them all. And the looks on their faces, especially this one girl, wont leave my head. That may have been the hardest part to see. 

Those are the two things that I cant stop thinking about, but there are so many other aspects of it floating around my head. The sound of the van hitting the cement. The look on the mans face when he was talking to the paramedics. The civilian bring (practially carying) the driver back to the scene. The sound of sirens. And it was one of those things that I shouldn't have been there. I should have been at work, or at home since I'd left early. My dad thinks that I saved the guys life, the one who was hit. He said that by doing what I wouldnt have normally done, I changed the course of what should have happened. If I didnt catch that bus, it would not have had to slow at my stop to get me and therefore would probably not have still been there when the van swerved around it and would have completely taken out the man and probably the group of kids. My sister said that she had heard something kind of like God doesnt give me more than I can handle but I wish he didnt trust me so much. She thought it fit the situation and I love her for sharing it with me. 

But, last night after I was home and such, Gwen and Pam and Nathan came over to visit Jana and I. Pam, Gwen and I had some drinks. Gwen had to go home kind of early, so she didnt get as drunk as Pam and I, but it was still fun. It definately took my mind off of what had happened earlier yesterday. I love my friends."

And I want to start a video blog (or, vlog) but I have no idea what to talk about. And seriously, who would want to watch me talk about nothing? 
It looks like fun, though, and I think I'll try. I've made about five videos tonight, all of them got deleted because they were dumb, but it's a start. Or something.


On a side note, there have been a hell of a lot of sirens in this area lately. Maybe it's just me noticing them more, but there are at least three that sound every night. And some go right down my street. It's creepy.


Anyway, this is a pointless and silly entry. I have nothing to talk about. I need someone to give me something interesting to think/talk about so I can start my vlog.


Oh, another side note. I plan on getting rather intoxicated tomorrow night. If anyone wants to join me, let me know. I already have two takers (and one observer/photographer as she is on antibiotics and cant drink) but the more the merrier!"

Work is ok, I suppose. Aside from the fact that I have to get up at five am, walk ten - fifteen minutes to my bus stop and transfer buses before I get to work. The job itself isnt too bad, tho. Email. It's easy.

I walked to the bank today to try and cash a cheque so that I could pay my rent and buy some buss tickets. On the way there, a big black cat crossed my path. He stood in front of me a moment and mewled. I stopped to pet him and he purred in my hand, then walked away. I think he was the most solid cat I'd ever seen, and it made me happy that I could make a black cat purr. I got to the bank and they couldnt cash my cheque for me, so I sat in front of the bank for a bit and cried on the phone to my mom. After she reassured me, I went into the bathroom of a near by restaurant to see if my eyeliner had run, it hadn't. I walked from the bank to the bus terminal where I bought my lunch for the day and proceeded to wait for my bus. Once at work, I was walking down the hallway to the 'lounge' when a co-workers bottle of Dr. Pepper exploded. All over me. I cleaned up a bit and sat at a table in the 'lounge' to eat the lunch I had bought and brought with me. Lo, it had leaked all over my bag that isnt mine and the deck of tarot cards I have had for years. I cleaned both as best I could, ate my lunch and headed in to my so called work. We're still training at work, though we've finished all of our training materials and now we're just killing time. The past two days I've been paid to read and play games. Today I did a good few readings with my cards. Tomorrow, I'm bringing my DS to keep me occupied since we'll more than likely be doing more of the same. My kitten had been ill. She had a cold, and I was scared for her. I was probably being silly, but I love my kitties so and I would never want anything to happen to them- especially if it meant that they wouldnt get to play together. As it was, Lulu got rather restless without her sister around. My kittens remind me so much of my sister and I as kids- I'm Lulu and Melanie is Odette. Tomorrow, my mom is coming into the city to cash my cheque for me so that I can get my rent paid and get some tickets so that I can get to and from work for the next little while. Next pay, I'll be investing in a bus pass. My weekend plans thus far include attending a Celebration of Life for one of my best friends late father and possibly heading out to the boonies for some down time with my folks. 
I guess that's all that I have to say for now. Possibly in the future I'll have more to post more often and more interesting."

"event","I may be broke, I may be sad, and I may even be stressed out, but I had a fantastic day.
It started with me waking up at beautiful Gwen's house, though she was already at work by this time, and getting ready to spend some time with some great folk. I met Allison at Scotia Square and picked up my awesome orange rug, which will be spread on my floor tomorow (or tonight if I feel so inclined), and browsed a couple of stores before I headed to a salon there to get the sides of my head trimmed as the hair there was starting to get long enough to curl again. So, while I was there we decided that it would be a good idea to hawk it up, so the hairdresser emptied a can or two of hairspray on my head and I've still got it standing. I'm going to see how long it will stay up for... I took lots of pictures tonight (man, do I like to take pictures of myself... it's kinda sad) some of which I will post at the end of this entry. After Scotia Square, Allison and I met Pam and Sara at Halifax Shopping Centre. We hung around for a bit, went to the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory where Allison and I split an amazing almond covered chocolate chip cookie, and Jana found us. So, the five of us (Allison, Jana, Pam, Sara and myself) wandered around the mall, making a purchase or two here and there. I got a wicked pair of orange summer-y shoes that lace up my leg. I also got a fish bowl and food and chemicals for said fish when I get it, but I didnt buy those- Pam gave them to me, and has (possibly) convinced me that I <i>can</i> have a fish that doesnt die. We'll see when I actually get a fish. Anyhow, we hung around at the mall for a while- most of the day, actually, until Allison drove me out to the airport (singing to Smash Mouth at the top of our voices, no less!) so that I could pick up my plane ticket. I'm officially going to Newfoundland! WOO! While we were at the airport, I checked my voicemail to find one from my sister and she sounded sad, so Allison, being the amazing friend that she is, drove me out to Lantz so I could visit my sister, show her my badass hair and cheer her up a bit. So, I got to play with my nephews (and the two little girls Mel was babysitting) and see my sister. heh The kids totally took right to Allison, especially Austin- which is odd for him because he doesnt really like new people a lot. After we left my sisters house, Allison and I stopped for coffee just before getting back on the highway and then we were on our way home, swapping childhood stories. Well, mostly I listened to Allison tell me stories, but it was awesome. AND! To make my day even BETTER, when I got home I had a letter waiting for me! One of the most awesome men I know sent me a letter (with monies in it and everything!) and it made me very happy. Morgan is a pretty cool guy and I'll be returning the letter asap- infact, it may just be tomorrow that I do! :D So, yea, I had a fantastic day. And now I am going to sleep, because I'm tired and sore from walking all day. But it's a good, happy kind of tired and sore.

Oh, and as promised, pictures of my badass hair: <lj-cut text=""here"">

I was supposed to start there doing eCare on the 25th, but it seems the eCare position had been pushed back until November sometime. And I finish Minacs on Monday. But, the call I got yesterday and returned today was from Perks- they wanted me in for an interview this afternoon. So, I went in and they hired me on the spot, pretty much. So I'll have some sort of income until November, which means I should be able to pay rent until then as well. 
I've been feeling weird lately. Kind of sad, but not. Frustrated, but not. I just have a jumble of lonely-happy-sad-excited-frustrated-giddy brewing up inside. There are just things in my life that I'd like to have done by now and they arent. I need to make some changes- I have made some, but I think that'll be just the start. I dunno. I have a tendancy to make big plans and not stick to them, another thing about myself that I would like to change. We'll see.
In more yay news, I'm going to Newfoundland on Tuesday. I'm pretty excited. I cant wait to see my friends again, and get a lot of my stuff that I had left there. I'll be in the Mount Pearl area from Tuesday morning until Sunday morning (my coming home flight leaves at 6:30am, which means I'm going to have to get up at like four. Gross) if anyone *cough*Justin*cough*Michelle*cough* wants to see me. :D I really cant wait to be in NL again, though, I miss being there.

"event","and in my new apartment! YAY! 
Things have been busy what with moving and all, but it was a good busy.
Things that are new:
- my apartment (and thus my room, yay!)
- my job (well, it's not new yet, but I'll be starting ecare at TeleTech on the 25th)
- my hair (ok ok, it's not new, but I love it so much I had to bring it up again!)
- having the INTERNET again! WOOOOOO!

Also, inbetween leaving minacs and starting at tele tech, I want to go to Newfoundland. I have to call Ians parents and make sure that it's ok that I stay with them for the few days I'll be there (I dont think it'll be a problem, i just want to make sure before I get there and all...), but I was pricing flights today (with the internet! god i'm so happy to have it back) and I can get a good price with Air Canada, so I think that's what i'll do. Except I cant use my credit card to hold the flight, I'll have to ask mommy... Anyhoo, that's about all that is new with me. 
OH! 50 mile yardsale is Saturday. We're leaving earlyish to get a good start on the day, everyone that lives in Halifax and has the weekend off (I'm looking at you Magan) should help us form a fleet of yard sailors. :D It'll be fun, I promise."

Yea, I got tired of the way my hair was going, so I gave myself a harcut last night. One step closer to my hawk! hehe Actually, I guess I could technically have a mohawk now, it's just not shaved on the sides yet. Ah well, what ever you want to call it, I have new hair and I like it! 
FOUR more days until we move! I can barely wait! Skylights! A living room! And my kitties! Oooo, the anticipation!!
I think I'm officially fed up with call centre work. Not that it's a bad job, or (where I'm at) terribly difficult. I just dont want it anymore. I so so so wish I had my portfolio here so that I could apply for some graphicly inclined positions, and I know that i could start a new one, however it wont be as good right now because (as far as digital art) I dont have a tablet and the facilities I had when I made my other one. And I dont really have the time to devote to it right now.
NEXT Sunday, come Hell or high water, I am GOING to Robyns house to watch So You Think You Can Dance! I dont care if I have to walk! Stupid lost bus pass ruining my plans yesterday... *grumble* At least I got some laundry done. AND! I've discovered a fantastic new (to me) game called Princess Maker 2. I've become completely involved in it. My daughter is now 17, is at master level in almost all of her studies, had won three combat championships AND has had four marriage proposals, all refused. Its quite amusing. 
Oh, and one more thing before I go- I saw a girl on the bus this afternoon who kinda looked like Ani Difranco. It made me smile."

"event","I lost my bus pass yesterday. I have no sweet clue how it could have happened. It was zipped in my wallet, in my bag, in my room all night. I had it when I got on the bus home from work Friday night, but when I went to get on the bus Saturday morning, it was no where to be found. Still cant find it. I dont really know how I'll be getting back and forth to work next week, I hate to ask people for money. But I have one bus ticket to my name, and maybe enough change for one ride. And I was supposed to go to Robyns house to watch so you think you can dance since i havent seen the last few episodes of the season, but with no bus pass and no money that doesnt look like it's going to happen. And to make matters worse, I woke up this morning to find my remaining fishie, Squash, floating. I feel so horrible, I can never seem to keep anything alive- maybe I should leave my kittens at my moms house...
I feel like i've been a crap friend these past few weeks. I feel like I havent been talking to many of my friends as much as I should be, or hanging out with them at ALL.  
gah, i'm going to have a bad day, i can taste it..."

"event","So, this was probably one of the shortest relationships I've ever had, aside from the one with Sam in elementary school where I was his girlfriend at recess and dumped by lunch. It's ok, though. I was pretty upset when she left my house Wednesday night, but mostly because I had made her feel badly. But after thinking about it for a while, I'm ok, and I think it may actually be better this way because I think it may have been too soon for either of us to be in a relationship again. But she called me tonight and we talked for over an hour about what happened and other random stuff and we're going to stay friends because we both think the other is pretty great. Which makes me happy because Pam is a great gal and I'd be sad if I never got to talk to her again.
In other exciting news, there was a fire at work today! It was intense. The alarm started going off, and my little group of work friends were the only ones who actually got up to leave. Everyone else was all looking around wondering what the noise was! Even the supervisors were just going about business, asking us where we were going when we started to evacuate. AND we couldnt find a fire exit! But then we did, and we were going down the stairs and the smell of smoke kept getting stronger. It was scary. Aparently the cause was an electral fire in, well, the electral room. It was a thrill and a half, I tell you.
SIX days until I move! It's terribly exciting! This will be the first apartment that I will have signed an actual lease for. I cant wait! AND it has skylights! hehe... I'm getting giddy just thinking of it! And the weekend after we move in is the 50 mile yard sale, where we shall find many marvelous things for our new place, I'm sure! 
Well, that's it for now. This week was rather less busy than the last week, but almost as eventful."

"event","So, I'm sitting here on the bed that I slept in so often as a child, staying at my aunt and uncles house with my parents and my sister, using some random hijacked internet connection to post this. I know I should be sleeping because I have to get up early tomorrow and face all of the same people I saw today, only tomorrow it will be worse because it'll be the actual funeral and today was just the viewing/wake. It's so strange to be back in Amherst- the last time I was here was for my grandmothers funeral. At the same funeral home and everything. This is the first time I've seen my uncles since then as well, I cant belive that it's been three years already since she's been gone. I've met a lot of family I didnt even know I had today, which seems to be the way funerals work. And weddings. I dont want that to be the only time I see my extended family these days, though I wonder who it will be that we're next visiting because- and will it be their funeral or wedding? I miss the closeness my mothers brothers shared with us (my sister and I) when we were tots. We were always visiting somewhere or other- every holiday we could get off of school for, and some we couldnt. I used to actually be friends with my cousins, and now I barely know them. I hate that I've grown away from my family, and I hate that I know it wont change. Even my immediate family- we havent grown apart in the fact that we dont talk or arent 'close', but even living home, I dont see them all that often. I havent seen my sister or parents (together) since July, for my nephews birthday. It's weird/nice to have the four of us together today, but it makes me sad that it doesnt happen more often. That's life, I guess. I was also thinking about how, if I was to ever be with a girl in a long term (or potentially long term) relationship, there is very little extended family I would be able to introduce her to as my girlfriend. My immediate family is awesome and would welcome her with open arms, but I know my aunts and uncles, on both my mothers and fathers sides, would shun me and cast me off. I guess I dont really have to worry about that, though, as I only seem to see them once every few years when there is a specific reason for us all to get together now."

"event","I've just gotten home from a pretty good evening of board games with good friends. Though tonight I got some rather upsetting news, I was glad I was with friends when I got it. With all of the stuff going on in my and my friends lives, I forget sometimes that there is other stuff going on in places that I cant be. 
My uncle Rick passed away this evening. He was the one with ALS, that was supposed to walk for this summer. The one that I havent been able to see in a couple of years. The one who used to take just me for ice cream for no reason and always asked about me first when talking to my mom. I cant believe that I'll never be able to see him again and tell him how much he has had an impact on my life, because I'm sure he didnt know it. I'll never be able to listen to his quiet wit and share private jokes with him again. I dont know when the funeral is yet, but I'm sure it will be soon, so I may be gone a couple of days next week. I'm sorry, Josie, if I wont be able to make it to your wedding. If anyone wants to make a donation to the ALS Society in my uncles name or anything (which would be much appreciated) his name is Richard Taylor.
Speaking of donations, I'd like to direct people to my friend Gwens journal at <lj user=avocado_farmer>, where she is raising money for Cancer (research, etc.)
This post was supposed to be for celebrating my best friends wedding, but that will have to wait until I've mourned. I'm sure she'll understand.

I just cant believe he's gone and I never got to see him."

"event","Two weddings this month! Crazy! I definatly have the 11th off for wanda's and will be trading a shift tomorrow for Josie's. I'm so excited that I will be able to attend both! I cant believe that two of my  best friends are getting married. I cant see me married at this stage of my life, and yet both my mother and sister were married- and with one child- at my age. Someday, but not right now.
I've been super stressed about money this week. I'm not going to have enough for bills. Some will be late and that makes me sad. There are things that NEED to be paid, and will be, such as rent and buspass, but it'll be tight. NEXT pay, however, will be nice as there is a civic holiday on Monday, which I will work though. At double time. And a half. For that one day, I will be making $27.50 an hour. I'm very excited. If only that was my regular rate of pay... I'd be a very happy girl.
I'm looking into attending curch again. Preferably an Anglican church, as that is what I was baptised (though I no longer consider my self as such), but any denomination will do. I just miss the unity church provided while I was growing up, the sense of community. And just because I dont necessisarily believe/worship/pray/what have you in the same way as I once did, doesnt mean I dont like church. I'd like to find one with a choir, as I also miss choir quite a bit, but that's secondary. I have to remember to check and see what times services are at the church close to the apartment here. Also, I believe that I may go to mass once or twice with Gwen to see how I like that. We may just become church buddies. :D
I walked up to Needs last night as I couldnt sleep and chatted with the lady working there a bit. She was telling be how they may be losing someone there soon and I mentioned that I had used to work at a Needs and miss it, so I may end up picking up a few shifts there now and then on days off. I'm excited. I miss working at a small corner store, but I dont want to have to give up on the job that actually pays well. I know that I tried the whole two jobs before (oddly enough, at needs and a call centre, just like now) and it didnt work so well, but I think it was because I was at needs first and had my call centre shifts mess up my needs shifts, but this way i'll be like, i can only work these days at this time to the people at needs, if they want me, but if I decide it's too much I wont feel gilty for leaving them since I hadnt been there long. All of this is, of course, assuming they want me to work there at all.

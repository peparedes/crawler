"event","as of yesterday i have been single and free for one year. free; it sounds melodramatic, i guess, but i've never stopped feeling that's the best word to use. a year of being actually myself, of breathing easy, of not second-guessing or doubting everything i thought, said and did. feels like freedom to me.

i owe you big, flist. i haven't been around a whole lot, i know, but i've been getting my shit together and a lot of you are part of the reason why i had the courage to get away in the first place. so thanks for that; i really needed it. :""}"

"event","i've finally figured out what it is about jack nicholson that freaks me out so badly-- one of the main things aside from the crazy-eyed intensity, that is. it's his diction-- he has such precise diction and he speaks so clearly and correctly, it can come across as really, really eerie. and then when he uses certain casual words (""don'tcha"" comes to mind cus he just said it on the tv) it's so super creepy, it's like he's *trying* to be casual in a way that's unnatural to him. 

this came up b/c i'm watching kubrick's version of 'the shining' for the first time; i've always avoided it because of how creepy i find nicholson, but i guess now i was ready for it cus i'm really enjoying it. it's shot really brilliantly and while nicholson's really not who i think stephen king was picturing when he wrote jack torrence, i think he's playing the character well. i do still prefer the miniseries, because it's more faithful to the book, but this is enjoyable. :) though oh my god, all that nails-on-the-chalkboard screeching music is giving me a headache, lol."

"event","i had pondered writing a post about coming out day, but then i read a bunch of posts that said everything better than i could have. for your consideration :

+ <a href=""http://azurelunatic.livejournal.com/6406994.html"">""fear, loathing and 'coming out'""</a> by <lj user=azurelunatic>
+ <lj user=elorie> discusses <a href=""http://elorie.livejournal.com/1313842.html"">the sexuality quiz show</a>.
+ a lot of you have probably seen <a href=""http://safezone.slu.edu/downloads/program.heterosexual%20questionnaire.pdf"">the heterosexuality questionnaire</a>, but it's worth reading again, i think.
+ <a href=""http://thingswithwings.dreamwidth.org/78524.html"">pondering the 'unified theory of gay'</a> by <b>thingswithwings</b> at dreamwidth.

another friend had a really interesting post, but it's flocked, sadly. but she made what is, i think, the best point so far which is that we often don't think of ourselves as being on the front lines of any kind of equality struggle, but we are. we have to do the hard work of coming out now because unless we do, there likely won't ever *be* a world in which no one assumes anything about anyone's sexuality, a world in which there's no need to qualify ""i like girls"" any more than there is need to qualify ""i like brunettes"" now. my friend also linked <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGtaLnZjMkc"">this youtube vid</a> in which a guy who makes greeting cards shows off some coming out cards, and at the end thanks the gay friends he had in school for showing him that gay people were real people too. that's why we have to do it (to paraphrase my friend) to build a world where people know we exist.

i've also been having really, really, really messed up dreams lately. not nightmares, just like, dreams containing people i haven't seen or thought of in years, really random and sometimes disturbing (in a where-the-fuck-did-that-come-from way) situations, and just a lot of stuff that leaves me waking up going ""what the everloving fuck, yo?"" i woke up this morning from one such and it kind of put a weird spin on the whole morning. sigh.

but i just cleaned and organized my room and vacuumed, which always makes me happy. i'd love to know what the gene is that codes people to take comfort from cleaning, b/c it definitely runs in my family, and it's very strange. rearranging furniture, too, i get such a kick out of that.

it's time for lunch. &hearts;"

the other best thing that's happened to me in the past few weeks was mainlining season two thru the current episode of supernatural. i watched season 3 in a DAY last week, lol, i'm caught up in time for tonight's ep and i cannot even talk about how fucking pumped i am about it. i love this show more than i did back when i was marathoning season one, and that's saying quite a bit given that <lj user=sekala> and i sat down and pretty much did the entire season in a week. i can't wait til i have money to buy the other seasons-- this is definitely a show i want to own all of. idk, i'd been spoiled for a bunch of what happens later on and i was still completely into it. castiel is one of the best additions to the show i could've imagined, i love the way he plays off both the winchesters and cannot wait to see more.

<lj-cut text=""musings on flash forward, cut for spoilers"">i'm sitting here with the second episode of flash forward and wondering if this is going to turn out to be a huge let down or if i'm going to end up loving it. on the one hand i can see the punchline of the show being about how you can't avoid destiny; but on the other hand i don't really know if i want to sign myself up for a season (or two or whatever) of getting invested in these characters and the story when most of what i've seen so far is gearing me toward not wanting the flash forwards to come true. i mean it'll be cool to see how the flash forwards come true, but otoh i'd like to see what happens if/when someone succeeds in avoiding theirs. idk. i'm not totally hooked on it right now, but i'm interested. the creepy/psychic kids thing is the part i'm most interested in at the moment, and finding out if there were any other people awake during the blackouts. soooo yes. anyone else w/thoughts on the show, i'd love to hear 'em. :D

---ETA WHOA WTF JUST HAPPENED. just saw the scene in the warehouse with the creepy dolls and the guy with the-- was that a fishtank full of gasoline or something? idek, i definitely didn't process all of it. ""he who foresees calamity experiences it twice over"", that's what he said, yes? huh. definitely another mark in the ""you can't escape destiny"" column. :x</lj-cut>

the next show i introduce myself to is probably going to be big bang theory. i have the first bunch of episodes DL'd and have been told repeatedly that i need to watch it, so, yeah watch out for that. :""D

that's it for now really, just still riding the high from the job thing and freaking out about spn in half an hour. for more fannish-type updates you can always check <lj user=betweenthebliss>, though there's not much there at the moemnt besides tweaking about the giant-ass fic i'm turning in two weeks from today (oh holy god) lol.

"event","this is definitely the black death. or something. i'm miserable. except i'm thrilled because not only did i get a second interview with lush but this is my last day at the terrible horrible no good very bad placement full of conservative homophobes. <b>HOO FUCKING RAAAAAAAAAAY.</b> so, okay, money might suck a little for a few weeks, but i did get all my bills for september scheduled and paid, and i don't have any plans to travel for a few weeks which is insanely lucky. so i can just kind of lay low for a while. which, NGL, will be really nice. i've been killing myself at this place for months and could use some time to refocus myself and figure out like, the loan business, and how i'm going to go forward with a job search. tonight i'll check postings at colleges and stuff, and maybe the providence journal job postings too. an application to best buy and borders are also in my future-- something that can transfer when i move. 

in any case, i'm optimistic. i feel awesome right now (emotionally, lol). now to finish out this day and go home and celebrate. \o/ and WRITE, oh my god. :""D"

"event","an actual update in the form of a list because that's about all my brain can handle right now. XD

+ been writing a lot, mostly fannish stuff but i'm getting in the habit of writing something just about every day, which is really a good habit to get into. even if it's just silly little drabbles, they're fun and it flexes my creativity muscles, which is never a bad thing.

+ have some really good plot going on TR that's making me insanely happy. especially the stuff with jon; it's been so, so, so long since i was genuinely jumping-out-of-my-seat excited about him, and i am SO fucking thrilled that i got my groove back (or his, lol). dropping edgar is going to suck, but it's the right decision. and fred, phedre and sandor are blissfully easy as always. phedre's going to get a weird EP next month, idk what it's going to be but i want to do something that's not just having her hang out in the compound or at the house. i am loving every single thread on fred's EP this month, and gilead homeplot has officially slain me with awesome.

+ making my friend's wedding dress is a stress bucket. i really love how it's coming out but i'm afraid she won't, idk, i know it's crazy since i'm following the design we agreed on, but fmeh. also time crunch; need to do a fitting this weekend and i'm not done tweaking some things yet... idk. i need to stop thinking about it, but that's difficult. >.>;;;

+ third appt w/my counselor this week. i really like her; it's a different kind of focus than i'm used to, everything relating back to thought processes and stuff, but i can tell it's really going to help me. plus it's nice to have someone to talk to. :3

+ i do not know what to get <lj user=rinlage> for her wedding. :E the registry is a dangerous place because not only do i want to get *her* one of everything, i want to get *me* one of everything. someone propose to me please, so i can have a party where people buy me stuff for my kitchen. XD

+ it's getting to be autumn, the season of birthdays (3 of my friends, me and my grandmother all w/in 6 weeks!) and leaves changing and halloween and everything i love best about living in new england. i'm so excited; i want to take a drive up to western MA in october sometime just to look at everything, because i know i'm really going to miss that. :3

that's it for now. i'm feeling really good about things, which is an awesome feeling to have, feeling like i'm mostly on top of my life and the things i'm not on top of, at least i'm getting there.

we got to talking about movies we'd loved in childhood and becky mentioned one where a kid got sucked into a vortex to another world through a greenhouse, wherein the flowers were actually people. she can't remember anything else about this movie, including the title, and it's driving her (and consequently the rest of us) totally insane. help, oh children of the eighties, if any of you can remember what this movie is. :""D

i come to you bearing music requests. :D i'm looking for a bunch of songs that i don't have and would like not to have to buy from itunes if i don't have to. these would be the following : ""seven nation army"" by the white stripes, ""that girl's a genius"" by jet, ""1901"" by phoenix, ""i know what i am"" by band of skulls, ""audience of one"" by rise against, and ""ghost town"" by shiny toy guns. 

i'll be happy to upload something, anything, for you in exchange; i don't have a list of all my music but if you give me a few track names or an idea of what you like i'll toss up a few things. :""D :""D

in other news, VACATION IS IN TWO DAYS. oh my god, i'm so excited it's like passed the point where it's real to me. in case you need a refresher, i'm going <a href=""http://www.dupontcastle.com/castles/dragonwo.htm"">here</a>, the appropriately named DRAGONWOOD CASTLE, with <lj user=ardavana>, <lj user=halfdreams>, <lj user=linaeloisetook>, <lj user=sekala> and <lj user=usually9_15>, for an entire fucking WEEK. while i'm there i'd like to read; you should all rec me a book now, one i can pick up at border's tomorrow and read while i'm sunning myself at my castle by the sea.

"event","wow, what a fucking weekend.

<lj-cut text=""epic post is epic..."">epic post is epic, as befits what was essentially one of the best weekends/trips/events of my entire f'ing life to date. seriously, the amount of awesome that was squeezed into the past four and a half days is kind of mind-blowing. 

driving to <lj user=douxquemiel>'s through the ninth circle of traffic hell (aka rt 93 at rush hour) was not so awesome-- but then i got to her (f'ing adorable!) apartment and got to take a shower with all of her fabulous lush bath stuff (not the last time lush will be mentioned in this post, ftr) then we headed off to the hotel in burlington, where <lj user=sekala>, <lj user=halfdreams>, <lj user=linaeloisetook> and <lj user=usually9_15> had already collected <lj user=lheena> and were waiting for us. sarah and i showed up and they were already in the hotel pool (amazing!). we swam for a bit and then headed out to dinner and a failed liquor store run-- for the record, google maps does NOT always know wtf it's talking about, as it sent us into a residential area in search of a package store. lol. lucky for us we already had booze and stuff back at the hotel, so after dinner night-of-drunkenness #1 commenced and we were up till 5:30. WIN. good drinks, good larp (sweet jesus christ, kirk and kara fucking scare the shit out of me with hilarity, sarah, in case i didn't flail enough at you already), good smoking conversations with steph, and general all-round awesomeness. 

friday we got up, swam, then went to search out food at the burlington mall. and then... sigh... and then, dear friends, sarah brought me into lush for the first time. ahhhh. i have no words. except that naturally i'm fucking hooked, and so *fucking* pumped at the prospect of not having horrible 14-year-old acneface anymore. (for serious how did i miss out on that shit when i was ACTUALLY 14 but now am in the throes of it at 25?) i got the test box of skin stuff and 2 samples of face cleansers that i am sooooo excited about. of course, i left it at sarah's, which means i'm probably going to have to train up and get it back this weekend (damn fresh stuff going bad in three weeks) but whatevs. worth it! we picked up <lj user=smuxis> and nelle's roommate sae!sarah (wtf is her LJ? FAIL) along the way for extra awesomeness, and did more shopping. i went into 'second time around', this upscale-ish consignment clothing store, and got a kenneth cole bright-as-fuck-red dress for THIRTY GODDAMN DOLLARS. it was decided that i needed to wear it that day, so for dinner we all got dressed up and went out to the macaroni grill where we - literally - turned heads walking in. bunch of hot-ass bitches right here, goddaaaaamn! XD we again failed at the liquor store, but managed to get coffee before heading back to the hotel and partying again until like 2:30. POP ROCKS COCKTAILS FTW. also it was mentioned that bert will end up acting around spock like stupid tourists act around the guards outside buckingham palace, which is still making me lol when i think about it now three days later (and not only because i instantly pictured spock in a tall furry hat, i swear). ETA - also when lena was getting ready to leave, sae started to laugh and basically spit in her face. 'twas fucking hysterical.

saturday was kind of a low-key day-- swam, checked out, got lunch, went back to nelle's and just sort of vegetated for a while. nelle went to the clinic for her weird fever thing, the rest of us went shopping to do sekrit party things for squot's belated birthday party we were throwing, and when we came back there was a balloon-blowing-up extrazaganza. then wes and sarah came over and we did the party, and then we hung out until super late once again. wes and i had wicked bonding time, which was fucking fabulous, as i love that boy to death. we ran to a convenience store for cigarettes at like 11:30 and then spent an inordinate amount of time outside smoking and talking. it's been a long ass time since i felt this easy a connection to a guy, and it's awesome. i've missed having guy friends. :} he also brings jayne cobb like a boss, which doesn't hurt AT ALL. xDDDDD

sunday we went to brunch at johnny d's. grapefruit mimosa, oatmeal, blueberry pancake, eggs and hash browns-- OM FUCKING NOM NOM. then, food coma back at nelle's, played fluxx with sarah while play-doh was made in the kitchen, then sam steph and nelle took off for home and the rest of us settled in to watch the screener of star trek on nelle's humongous tv. that was awesome not least b/c sarah and i still hadn't watched it together yet, so there was a ton of squee and laughing and general hilarity. also idk if i'm the only one who gets fond/proud to see their canons affect someone else, but squot wept more than once and i was *absurdly* happy to see her love it so much. after that we watched asoue and iron man, which i napped during the middle of, and then woke up for a second wind of 2am chinese food leftovers. lulz. and i wonder why i had odd dreams? oh and, for the record, nobody at any point during all four days of this weekend got a hangover. we are all clearly made of insane amounts of win.

then yesterday was boston museum of science day, which was also absurd in its level of awesome. the walk in the rain from the galleria to the museum was epically wet and super fun, and the museum itself was incredible. i hadn't been since i was probably in high school, and it was just as awesome as i remember. sarah, nelle, squot and i just wandered around gleeing over everything-- the electricity show was wicked fucking awesome, just as i remembered it, and the mathematica room intrigued me beyond words-- probably could've spent 45 min in there alone. also the birds room was awesome, and the t-rex, and the . :3 then we went back to nelle's and watched resident evil 3 while nelle had her dentist appt (oh my god, <lj user=parallelstrand>/<lj user=expendableasset> OTP FOREVER) and then went to sarah and wes's for pizza, wine, fluxx and more amazing conversation. i just love how well we all hang out together, all of us, and i fucking loved how chill last night was. going from pizza to poetry to ""oh shit watch this fanvid"" to politics to graphic design in the space of six hours-- fucking win, guys. seriously.</lj-cut>

and then this morning i got up after roughly 4 hours of sleep, drove nelle and squot back to nelle's place, and got myself from boston to cumberland in an hour to be on time to work, <b>LIKE A FUCKING BOSS.</b> i left my leftovers so i have no lunch (bk ftw/ftl, you decide) and i'm pretty much going to be dead by the time 5pm hits, but whatever. this weekend was so necessary.

....actually you could really sum up this entire post in six words. <b>i fucking love my second family.</b> 
<small>goddam!</small>

.....oh yeah. today/tonight are for f'ing TAGGING, since i did, uh, NONE OF THAT while i was away. and reqs gotta get made, son."

usual fandoms apply; check my icons/interests if you're unsure, or just give me choices. i'm going to be packing tonight for my Weekend of Awesome<sup>(TM)</sup> so i'll need distractions-- also from the fact that my mother is currently sort of not speaking to me, or at least is very annoyed b/c apparently despite the fact that this trip has been planned since OH I DON'T KNOW, FEBRUARY, she missed the memo that i was going to be away from thursday night to monday night-- and now is doing that ""you can afford to take time off work?"" thing at me. yes mom, yes i can, because my job fucking loves me and i can handle it. ugh. i mean sure i don't have as much money as i'd like to for the weekend, but i have ENOUGH-- like, i might be broke at the end of it, but wtf-ever, i have scheduled all my bills for the next three weeks and i'm totally fine, so, whatever.

i'm currently reading <u>the court of the air</u> by stephen hunt and it is fucking OWNING me. gyah. oh steampunk, how do you manage to be so consistently awesome. 

i got my hair cut short again for the first time in a year (holy crap, seriously, last time i had it cut short was june 27th last year) and i am SO FUCKING HAPPY ABOUT IT. it's funny that it was becky who convinced me i should cut it-- she said ""i feel about your hair the way i feel about starbuck's-- when it's long, it looks great and really pretty and feminine, but then she cuts it off and you're just like BAM, YEAH."" -- and that's a direct quote, lol. it makes me laugh a) because she clearly knows the easy way to flatter me, and b) the irony, given how obsessed she is with being ""pretty"" -- but i guess she also knows me well enough to know that that's not an adjective i've ever given a shit about having applied to me, so, there you go. XD i feel pretty fucking badass with the new 'do though (see icon, lmao).

sigh. okay. time to eat something, and then to pack. my list is *prodigious*. :""D

it's actually just a random ""whassup"" post, and since i feel like half my brain has been drowning in star trek lately, the icon is actually pretty appropriate.

THINGS.
<ul><li>the babiest kitty ever, aka pippin, had to go to the vet yesterday. he has this weird growth on his tail that started bleeding over the weekend (not good) also for the past several months every now and then he'll go a day w/o eating and then throw up everywhere and forget how to use the litter box. >.> distressing, but he never *acts* like he feels sick, so we've put off a vet visit, but he had to go b/c of the tail thing. long story short, it's a fatty tumor, benign, but if the meds they gave him don't shrink it they'll have to operate, which will involve amputating about half his tail. :/ :/ :/ meh. i hate pet worries. haven't had to deal w/this since my cat had fleas in fall of 07... hope the meds work.</li>
<li>california, you fucking suck. can't really say more than that without this entire post becoming a rant about prop 8. i expected this to be the decision, but that doesn't lessen the disappointment any. thanks to <lj user=halfdreams> for the quotes she posted; they help, but like she said, though the destination of our long road is inevitable, it's hard to sit with now.</li>
<li>this weekend was really nice. i slept and did fuck-all nothing for most of it; monday did an obscene amount of yard work and totally fucked up my body, as usual... i really am so excited i finally got off my ass and did my gym membership transfer, so now i can start working out again and not feel like i've been run over by a bus every time i physically exert myself.</li>
<li>rice cakes with peanut butter make a good snack. om nom nom.</li>
<li>as <lj user=bsafemydeers> said on twitter this morning-- how is it that i can sleep four hours and wake up perky as fuck, then the next night sleep seven hours and wake up feeling like death barely warmed over? what the shit, body, for serious. this is what i get for forgetting my ""help you sleep"" supplements before bed three nights running, i guess.....</li>
<li>brain status : 30% trek, 30% tabula rasa, 30% worrying about jobs, 10% worrying about school. those last two things are firmly in the ""do not talk about"" category today; idk why but i can just tell panic is imminent. sooooo yeah-- brainless stuff FTW, probably just hanging around <lj user=ontd_startrek> and doing tr shit all day. and all night. yeah.</li></ul>

so keep your fingers crossed for me guys. i'm really hoping this will pull through.

on the plus side though, yesterday was an awesome day. like, i was really in a good mood all day long. i wrote, i made tonight's dinner ahead of time, i did some tr plotting -- minimal tagging, but that's what tonight's going to be for. so, hooray. hopefully i can shake this anxiety BS and get that mood back again, it was a really nice feeling. :}"

it's also taken me like the past three days to recover from the weekend. i spent probably a sum total of 4 hours of a three-day weekend with my father, and he managed to stress me out to the point i've had to have a glass of wine every night this week in order to fall asleep. -.-;;;;; so glad that stress is over-- and even more glad i don't have to do ANYTHING this weekend besides like, clean the house and maybe garden. \o/

"event","so let me preface this by saying, i'm too young to have watched the original series of star trek when it was first airing. in fact, i'm young enough that i grew up in the heyday of the next generation-- for years it was the only TV we were ever allowed to watch during dinner, and one of the only shows i ever watched as a kid that aired later than 6pm. i've seen most TNG episodes several times, and while i haven't watched in a few years, i can still talk about the characters and some plot points with decent familiarity. i have seen a lot of TOS, but not enough to really be solid on the continuity of the story, or any of the characters. i know DS9 and voyager much better; far less well than TNG, but i was still (to my recollection, anyway) in middle school when they aired, so i remember watching new episodes as they came out.

the whole point of this is that while i absolutely 100% consider myself a trekkie, i am not at all able to say i *know* TOS well. i loved it, sure, and still do, whenever i happen to catch a rerun. but i'm not someone who is/was likely to be sitting in the theater this past weekend trembling with trepidation in case the movie didn't get canon /just right/. i wouldn't have known if they had or hadn't. 

but what i do know is how trek-- all the shows, all the episodes-- makes me feel. why i like them-- no, <i>love</i> them so much, even with the camp and stereotypes and often issues with race and gender that make me cringe. because-- and this probably isn't a shock to anyone who knows me-- i'm weak like a weak, weak thing for strong characterization-- for characters who are real people, flawed and sometimes prejudiced and sometimes ignorant but <i>real</i> for all that. and so for me, trek has always been about the people i've come to love through the years. i feel about it the way i feel about LotR in some respects-- in a way that knows i could never possibly fathom the ways it's shaped my taste in books, movies, tv shows -- though i can tell you right now, i'd never have lost my shit over kara thrace if i hadn't also loved tasha yar to the depths of my ten-year-old soul. 

okay, okay, coming to the point of this post. The Movie. i saw it on sunday and was completely fucking floored. there wasn't a moment of it that i didn't passionately adore. i'm not saying it was perfect-- far from it! <b>but that's what made it star trek</b>. for all the plot holes and miniskirts and cosmic coincidences, it was so utterly harmonious with every experience of the show i've ever had, that i couldn't <i>not</i> love it. it did exactly what JJ wanted it to do-- remind everyone that TOS is where it all began, and that it spawned such a huge franchise <i>for a good fucking reason</i>. IMO the movie didn't reboot TOS canon-- it gave it a paint job and put some high-grade oil in the engine, and set it loose on a flat stretch of highway. what's under the hood hasn't changed-- round, flawed, <i>deep</i> characters who are strong in personality and fierce in feeling, whose relationships with each other define them and make them better people. 

i read somewhere the actors are in contract for a sequel. i cannot wait. there are few movies i can think of that i'll be more excited about in the coming years-- 'cause this is more than just fulfilling the pitter-patter of my geeky little heart. this is taking something that in a lot of ways helped define my childhood, and giving me a whole new score of reasons to love it as an adult. and i can't think of anything that makes me happier.

ps, i'm seeing it again tomorrow. XD"

"event","a long time ago i made an LJ purely for keeping track of my fiction. i have this habit when i'm bored of picking up the nearest available piece of paper and writing on it-- when i worked at faces or blockbuster or barnes & noble, those were pieces of receipt tape. in office jobs it'd be a piece of looseleaf or the back of a sheet from the recycling bin. and i can't tell you how many times i would come home and realize it wasn't in my pocket anymore, or worse, a few days later realize i'd put it through the wash. fucking infuriating.

anyway, the point is i've been writing parts of my book on that journal for a while now, and i'm surprised at how well it's working for me. it's a lot less daunting than a word document; when i'm ready to write, i just make a new post, and i don't have to worry about where it fits in with the rest of the story just yet, or the transitions, or any of that other stuff. i just write what is in my head to write, and edit it in comments later so i can see the evolution of what i wrote. it's really baffling me how easy it's making it for me to just get shit out on the ""page""... like, i'd say my worst flaw in the technical aspects of writing is how much i hate to write badly.... which i know you have to, that's what editing is about, but if i get stuck on something it's really hard for me to put down a crappy description or some shitty dialogue just to get me through to the next part. but with this it's not as hard, both b/c i know i can just hit post and go to something else, and b/c i know i can edit it later-- and editing a three-page entry is a lot less daunting than editing a section of a 50 page manuscript.

idk, i guess this is just to say that i'm writing, like actually regularly writing something that comes from my own head, and that i like what it is that's coming out. it's been a long time since i could say that... any of it. 

today is also six months since i moved out of the house on russell street. coincidence... fuck no.

"event","i feel like i was just physically assaulted. 

i'm a temp, and i'm working at a neat little textile company in northern rhode island, doing orders and customer service. most of the people i've met are really sweet, and while i'm fairly sure none of them are gay, i don't feel weird or awkward around them. i'm not about to come out, but i don't feel like i *have* to hide it (say, the way i did when i was working at a catholic college, yanno?). so where i'm sitting is this small office with just me and one other dude (ironically the only person in the office i think could possibly be gay) and it's not at all on the way to or from anything-- we don't get a lot of visitors, we just sit and chat and make phone calls and freak out about customers all day. it's brilliant.

so yesterday while i was the only one in here, this random woman came in and just, out of nowhere, started flapping her jaw about her daughter's first communion-- like talked my ear off for fifteen minutes when i gave absolutely NO indication that i was interested (because i was really busy, also b/c i think the idea of taking your seven-year-old to a hairdresser and a nail salon for her first communion is fucking ludicrous). now, people who can't take social cues make me nervous to begin with-- i have my own brand of social anxiety, and people who won't just leave me the fuck alone when i'm sending blatant DO NOT WANT vibes kind of scare me. i was hoping that would be a one-time encounter and that perhaps by the next time i saw her i'd be able to make a convenient getaway. 

today she came into the office again and started chatting about her evening-- again, *totally out of the blue* as if we were picking up a conversation that had left off five minutes ago. and in the process of today's fifteen-minute monologue, this woman managed to casually insult gay people, black people, hispanic people, single parents, jewish people and muslims <b><i>without even realizing she was doing it</i></b>. like, ""so-and-so her husband left her for <i>a gay guy</i>, tchahahaha,"" trying to share this conspiratorial chuckle with me, not at the expense of the poor woman whose husband is *GASP* a fag now, but at the sheer lunacy of gay men in general. and ""so-and-so has kids from three different guys and isn't married to any of them! *pointed look of disapproval*"" it just went on. by the time she left my heart was racing and i honestly felt like i was on the point of hyperventilating if she'd stuck around any longer. 

the worst part was the assumption that i shared her views. she mentioned several times about how the foster child her sister is housing at the moment isn't baptized-- ""that might be okay if you're, like, jewish, but YOU KNOW, dot dot dot""-- and seemed amazed when i didn't commisserate. i'm really glad i have more self-control than i did three or four years ago; twenty-one year old emily would've stood up and said ""well you're talking to an agnostic pansexual who may be white but sure as hell isn't scared of getting swine flu from hispanic people, so maybe you should rant to someone else."" and then she'd have gossiped, and i probly would've lost the placement. 

it's been almost an hour, and i still feel jumpy, jittery, the way i do when i don't eat for hours. i'm finding it so hard not to hate her; i know she has absolutely no fucking clue what she just did to me, and that if i tried to explain it to her she would not understand. it's really not her fault, or at least i can understand why she's ignorant. she was raised a conservative catholic in rural rhode island, and she's lived here her whole life. she doesn't know how to be anything else. it's not her fault. but god damn, i am really having a hard time not judging the society that continues to churn out these ignorant-minded people with their heels stuck so hard in cement that they don't even want to realize there's another way to think of the world, let alone actually change their own views and biases. my best friend says she wants not to have to tell people she's gay the way straight people don't have to tell others they're straight; that there shouldn't be an assumption one way or another. i couldn't agree more. i just don't know what to do with myself when confronted with stuff like this-- i guess it's a byproduct of having lived for so many years in a place where you were the odd one out if you /were/ straight.... but i don't have the skills yet to find a kind way of telling people like that that their assumptions are leading them to speak in a way that is extremely hurtful to me... and i'm not secure enough not to be afraid of being judged, even if i did have the words to say it. at least not at work, i'm not... when something besides my job hangs in the balance, i could care less. but i've already lost one job i liked because of a bigoted uber-christian supervisor, and i really don't care to have it happen again.

as a corrollary, i really wish there were a way to explain to livejournal that this, this level of shock and assault, is how gay people feel every single time one of those fucked-up anti-gay NOM ads appears on a journal they're reading. it's not happened to me yet, but just knowing it's there makes me scared. that's not okay. lj used to be my safe space; with that shit out there, it feels like less of one. (for those who might not know what i'm talking about, read <a href=""http://snugglebitch.livejournal.com/54663.html"">here</a> and <a href=""http://telesilla.dreamwidth.org/13282.html"">here</a>. even if i weren't good friends with a trans guy, <a href=""http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x4/JackAndAHat/LJAd.jpg"">this</a> would set me frothing at the mouth.)

ok.... time to look at lolcats or something to make myself feel better again.

last weekend (not these past two days, but the weekend before that) i went back to mount holyoke for a reunion of my a cappella group. since youtube took down all the vids of the group, i know there's little i can say to convince y'all not to start calling me andy bernard... but trust me when i say this was not lame a cappella. this was balls-out rock-till-you-drop a cappella, just two dozen chicks, a tranny boy and music that rang to the fucking rafters. (....and sometimes there were also dance routines. what, don't judge me.) if you're on facebook, go to my profile and surf through to the M&C's group, or go to http://www.mtholyoke.edu/org/milkandcookies and check it out. 

it's something almost impossible to explain unless you were part of it (or, like <lj user=nickhornby>, <lj user=douxquemiel>, <lj user=rhealitycheck> and many others, saw us perform) but it just kept occurring to me over and over and over again throughout the weekend how completely and utterly altered my life would be if i hadn't joined the group. aside from the fact that i literally don't know who or what i would be if i hadn't become friends with <lj user=usually9_15> when i did... i don't know if i'd have realized i was gay when i did, or come out when i did, or been a part of a relationship that did and still does shape who i am as a person... all the traveling, the people i connected with, who knows how that would be? who knows who *i* would be? i have no idea. if not for this group i might be married to my highschool boyfriend and wondering why i was so miserable. who the fuck knows?

it was the 20th anniversary of the group's founding; that's why we were all there. after we saw the current group perform on saturday night (during which i was reduced to a blubbering mess no less than three times, natch) i was outside smoking with caitlin and ryan and liz, and i had this epiphany, and i blurted out, ""this is the most important thing i've done with my life so far."" which may sound lame, but honestly, it's so fucking true. now as an alum i look back and still proudly say i was part of something that spans 20 years and now will go on for god knows how many more, and it will always be something i'll be proud to talk about. and the thing this weekend showed me is that <i>i am still part of it</i>, and i always will be.

this is so sappy, but i just had to write about it. especially with the advent of warm weather and everything i'm looking forward to about the summer... when i was on campus i spent part of the time really nostalgic and sad; my life was much simpler when i was at mhc, not only for the obvious reasons but because i was still such an optimist about my life. these past four years (especially the last two, oy) have really drained a lot of my drive and faith in myself, and i didn't even realize it until i was back there. but instead of making me more depressed it made me want to get it back, to get ME back. it was a decision i didn't even realize i was waiting to make until i made it. 

so that's where i'm at... finally starting to feel like myself again, like the version of myself that i wanted and still want to be. so thanks, mount holyoke, you did it again. ;)"

also, i haven't been doing a lot of LJ updating, been on twitter more often-- not that there's much of anything of content on my twitter page, but if you feel like friending, go ahead. :)

i am *drowning* in tags. in a good way, like, right now i am so so so so excited about every single thing i have going on. i have PLOT, for chrissakes, and new prospects surfacing on several counts, and i still have so much to DO this week, but omg, being busy is gooooooooood. also, this isn't often true, but my RP writing and my other writing are actually running parallel to each other in terms of productivity and creativity. i like it. 

<a href=""http://www.contrariwise.org"">contrariwise.org</a> is a blog of literary tattoos. surfing this shit is dangerous; i now want to cover my entire body in quotes. not that that's terribly different than my normal state of being, but now i actually have examples of how awesome word tattoos can actually look. :x <lj user=lheena> and <lj user=linaeloisetook>, <a href=""http://www.contrariwise.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/vfdankle.png"">this one</a> made me think of you guys. aaaaaand i'm pretty much in love with the idea behind <a href=""http://www.greatwhitesnark.com/2008/09/04/librarian-gets-tattoo-of-the-harry-potter-dewey-decimal-number-gws-reader-ink/"">this one</a>, and if i ever get my ass in school, i will totally consider something similar, probably not w/HP, but idk. it's awesome to ponder, though. XD

and my placement at this data entry job is ending on friday, about a month and a half sooner than expected. this is upsetting only in that it tweaks my anxiety, wondering if i did anything to make them cut me over one of the other temps, but the others have been there since september so if they were going to cut one it makes sense for them to cut the one who's only been there seven weeks.... but still. >.>;;; after the shit that went down at northwestern and at honda, i'm super paranoid. anyway, it's okay, because i'll be moving to another placement at brown university in about a week and a half / two weeks, one that isn't just dumbass data entry, one that will hopefully let me use my brains a bit. also, in a way cooler part of the city, literally on top of thayer st. which is kind of my favorite place to hang out, so, that's awesome, and it pays almost $2/hour better than this. i just hope they call me back today to confirm that i've gotten it; this agency has offered me stuff this juicy before only to retract it later, so, plz keep fingers crossed that i get a lucky break on this one. :|

also, mom and i played hooky from work yesterday. it was awesome... i really needed it, we did a bunch of stuff, and it was just nice to hang out and kind of have a free pass day.... weekends we always have Things To Do, and it was great to just sort of... idk, even though we were running errands for a lot of the day, it felt v. relaxing. and we went to a pampered chef party at night, which was also awesome, and she's going to be hosting one for her work friends in may. she bought some really cool stuff, i'm quite excited for the mail to come next week, lol.

oof, hunger, and it's only 10:15. guess this is what happens when i get up early enough to exercise and then only eat a piece of toast with peanut butter for b'fast. >.>;;;;;

"event","+ books books books books BOOKS. finished 'seabiscuit' without <i>actually</i> crying, only getting suspiciously hoarse* and stuffy <strike>many</strike>several times throughout. amazing, amazing book. now onto 'uglies' by scott westerfeld, thanks to <lj user=halfdreams> for the recommendation (and steph, i almost just typed your twitter name as your LJ name, haha, OOPS) and after that 'small wonder' by barbara kingsolver and a reread of 'at swim, two boys', which i am SO looking forward to.

+ this is a strange thing to admit, but perhaps other writerly types will know what i mean. the other day i wrote something, just a couple hundred words for a meme on TR, that was... and i mean it... the best thing i've ever written. it snuck up on me-- i finished it, reread, didn't edit a single thing, posted it and then went "".....omg did i actually write that shit?"" <lj user=ashkitty>'s reaction to it was exactly what i'd wanted, which was awesome, and hearing stuff from other people helps me know i'm not crazy and/or making it up, lol, but like... i have *never* finished writing something and just known it was right, like, completely right, start to finish. felt fucking awesome. now if only i can do it with characters *i* make up, ahaha.

+ on the other writing note, however, i have been working a lot on stuff. a short story, bits of a novel, and it's actually working. like, right now a lot of what i'm doing is just going over old notes and reworking them, but it's happening, i'm not hitting road blocks, and i can see where i want to go. it's.... terrifying, actually, ahaha, but in an awesome way.

+ the bsg finale. i still haven't figured out what i thought of it. that'll probly get its own cut/filtered post at some point, after i re-watch it... it's strange, i don't feel as sad as i did after the west wing ended, but i've realized i think that's because to me the finale left a lot of room for me to pick and choose what to focus on, a lot of room to interpret. and i like that.

+ this weekend i'm making the dummy dress for my friend meghan's wedding dress. :} it's going to be interesting-- i'm making the dummy, in 2 weeks when she's here she'll try it on and we'll fit it and figure out what she wants changed or altered, and then i get started on the real thing. i'm scared, but also really excited. it's a very simple pattern, but it's going to be f'ing gorgeous when i'm done (if i do say so myself, lol) and heeeeee i'm so excited. two of my best friends are getting married in september (and thank god they didn't schedule it for the same day, ahaha), it's very bittersweet. we're f'srs grownups now. :x

+ i really want to watch a silly movie tonight. like.... night at the museum, or something. >.>;;;; either that or a scary one, but i'd be watching sth scary by myself, so mebbe not.

+ for those who partychat on gtalk.... apparently partychat is run out of some guy's basement? i've heard this like, fourth-hand, but apparently the reason pchat has been fucking itself in the face these past few days is b/c this dude who runs it (manages it? whatever) is having issues w/his server/connection/whatever. total non-sequitur, but whatevs. sketchy news is fun news.

+ i'm still LOLing over things from last weekend. like... MY FAAAAAAAAACE.

this show has meant so much to me. not only catapulting itself almost instantly to the position of my favorite TV show, but also for the ways it's surprised, impressed, intrigued and touched me. i'm sure any other fan will agree; this show has something special. it's different. i don't think anyone ever expected it to be this good, but for anyone who's doubting whether or not it's worth it to pick up, <i>don't doubt</i>. watch it. you will never, ever regret it.

i'm so, so happy i'm able to watch the finale tonight as it airs. that's only ever happened to me with one other (the west wing) which meant about as much to me as this does, but nerdy as this is, it's a milestone to me. tv will be different after tonight.

both <lj user=scifiwire> and <lj user=knitmeapony>'s twitter feed provide me with zillions of little fun things / stories throughout the day. like these - <a href=""http://syndicated.livejournal.com/scifiwire/2780221.html"">steampunk cylon gallery</a>, <a href=""http://twurl.nl/1b34yk"">Extreme Sheepherding</a> (yes, they're Welsh, ahaha, marisa's mad), <a href=""http://twurl.nl/tqdpgn"">pouring sheets of lead for pipe organs</a>, and <a href=""http://twurl.nl/pyhwpc"">gallery games</a>. thanks guys. :D

finished the 2nd locke lamora book. really can't handle how awesome it was, how totally gripping. it's been a long, long time since a book really sucked me in like that-- the first law trilogy did, but none of the characters in that really stole my heart-- stole my head, sure, but not my heart, not the way locke and jean did. (the fact that they are, essentially, bert and alain, has not escaped my notice either. :P) but yes... these books are a must-read... basically it's like danny and rusty from ocean's 11 set in an 18th-century-italian style semi-steampunk world. iiiincredible.

ok. day almost over. then is weekend of amazingness with <lj user=lheena>, <lj user=douxquemiel> and the other usual suspects. it's gonna be fucking amazing... and <lj user=hedonisticated> just gave me her # so i can drunkenly harass her tomorrow night. XD oh yeah, it's gonna be a good weekend."

AND I HAD BEEN SO TIRED I WENT TO SLEEP W/O WATCHING BSG. <b>STILL</b>. 

tonight i better sleep fucking awesomely with no dreams, cus i swear, my subconscious is gonna get a fucking beatdown otherwise.

also woke up to like 298729384 texts from my ex about why i hadn't read/replied to the email she sent me on saturday. spent first two hours of morning @ work trying to construct careful, kindly worded reply to the effect of 'please stop being a possessive freak kthx'... then remembered she doesn't have any of my stuff anymore, and therefore there is no need to beat around the bush, so just scrapped it and basically wrote her ten lines that was like 'you're being crazy, fucking lay off me, you nutter'. was really liberating.
<b>eta :</b> 7pm and she just called me. for serious, what the fuck is this? what part of ""broken up"" do you not get? UGH.

going after work to get the sequel to 'lies of locke lamora'. fucking insane how much i loved that book-- and <lj user=technosage> reminding me how awesome locke and/or jean would be on tr didn't help. :E :E :E *noms her face*

"event","<lj-cut text=""possible tmi"">so i get seasonal eczema on my hands in the winter, and it shows up as these little blistery things that look kind of like mosquito bites or tiny zits, except they're clear and full of water. it's so fucking gross (at least to me, it's probly not even noticeable to anyone else unless they were staring intently at my hands), and i am so fucking sick of it. the only remedy i've found that works is to get zinc oxide and slather my hands with it and wear gloves when i sleep. obnoxious, let me tell you. and this year it's gone on longer than it has since i was in high school. some years, esp. when i was living in the valley, i didn't get it at all, i guess maybe b/c the humidity/altitude is different... anyway, i'm just really g-damn sick of it, like, it can be spring any time now so this shit goes away. -___-;;;</lj-cut>

last night was fucking awesome. those of you that were reading twitter already know this, lol. i hung out with my best friend from high school, the one who has the same birthday as me, and holy crap it was awesome. we went to a restaurant and got nachos and drinks, and then back to her place and had beers (and coffee-flavored patron, omg, soooo tasty) and hung out w/her friend who lives in the apt above hers. it was extremely awesome, i'm so excited to have a friend here again, and the possibility of hanging out w/them again really soon. i'm so jazzed. :D :D and omg we laughed about so many old jokes and reminded each other of the crazy shit we did in high school... it was so much fun. i might go out w/them tonight, but might not, idk. depends on how i feel later-- right now i kinda feel like if i drink again tonight i'll want to die tomorrow, lol. so we'll see.

only downside was that in my drunken idiocy i tripped going out of her apt to smoke at one point, and when i woke up discovered that i'd skinned the front of my ankle on the way down-- like, the curve where your leg becomes the top of your foot, that is all skinned and bloody. felt awesome ripping my sock off this morning, lemme tell you. >.>;;;;"

"event","my whole life i've never been a cd-buying person; it's always been too hard to conscience spending $15 on a cd i don't know if i'll even like, so i get most of my music taste from the radio or from other people. but there are albums i've either been given as a gift or bought on a whim or known from the second i heard one of the songs that i had to own, that have ended up rocking my world. here are the top 26 (cus of course i couldn't pare down, lol). and holy fuck, did this take me a long time!

<lj-cut text=""stolen from sunny..."">in no particular order....

1) <i>indigo girls, self titled</i> : i got this album as a gift from my favorite aunt for my tenth birthday; it was the first CD i ever owned. i remember it vividly; i loved it from the very first second i put it in. i joke that i was predisposed to being gay b/c of listening to this as i was growing up, but in reality i can't think of an important time in my life that i don't associate with one or more of the songs on this disc.
2) <i>dave matthews band, under the table and dreaming</i> : this was one of the cds i got during my columbia house music club phase in 8th grade, and i have never regretted it. i am deeply in love with dave's voice, and the band's ability to rock out beautifully and intricately using a wide variety of instruments and sounds. coming from a combination classical music and classic rock background, i love everything about dmb-- they really make music as art, and this was the album that first introduced me to their awesomeness.
3) <i>korn, follow the leader</i> : laugh all you want, but i was fifteen when i first listened to this album, and i really <i>got</i> that music didn't have to be about anything more than reaching in and ripping your guts out. totally contradicts what i said above about DMB, but sometimes you just need to scream, or listen to other people scream, and korn is so, so good for that. i don't listen to the album anymore really, but there are a few tracks from it, and from other korn albums, that i still dig when i'm in an angry mood.
4) <i>bush, 6teen stone</i> : another vestige of columbia house- i think i'd heard one song by bush and decided to order this on a whim, and was greatly rewarded. gavin rossdale has a *gorgeous* voice, as well as knowing how to seriously rock out, and i love his weird angsty lyrics. 'glycerine' has a special place in my heart, and still sometimes makes me a little misty-eyed.
5) <i>green day, dookie</i> : the second cd i ever owned, which i hated at first because i was completely ignorant of anything approaching modern music-- i was 10 and was pretty much only allowed to listen to NPR and classic rock, lol. i dragged it out again when i was 12 or so and listened again, and loved it. this was the album that got me into liking modern alternative rock.
6) <i>joni mitchell, blue</i> : one of my earliest memories is of driving somewhere with my mom, sitting in the back seat of the car, while she sang along to 'carey' on the tapedeck. joni's been a part of my life forever, my music taste wouldn't be what it is without her. she's why i like tori and imogen heap and regina spektor; she gave me that appreciation for a voice so soaring and breathtaking it only needs one instrument to complement it, and sometimes not even that.
7) <i>tracy chapman, new beginning</i> : wooo, empowering lyrics meet fucking ridiculously stunning voice! i got given this album for christmas 2001, and i still know it forwards and backwards. listening to it got me listening to her earlier stuff, too, which is also ridiculously amazing, and started a movement for me to start listening to older music (ie: not stuff that had come out while i was in high school, lol). i really do love when artists sing <i>good</i> music about activism, and she really gets me fired up. :)
8) <i>tori amos, little earthquakes</i> : first heard this album when i was 13 staying at my aunt's for a week during the summer. i liked it then, but when i picked it up again three years later it hit me in a vastly different way, and i was totally hooked. 'happy phantom' especially struck me; later on i used it to try out for the m&c's. :}
9) <i>ani difranco, little plastic castle</i> : i'm not an ani freak. i like a lot of her stuff, but this is the only album of hers that i LOVE. bought it senior year of high school when i was mad about a lot of things and didn't know how to express it; kept on listening especially thru my parents' divorce two years later. her voice just grabs me-- to be cliche, she puts the grrr in girl, lol, but without being fucking crazy like courtney love. 'deep dish' is one of my favorite songs, and 'gravel' is *always* fun when i'm pissed off. 
10) <i>maroon 5, songs about jane</i> :  if i were to order this list by biggest impact on my life, this album would be in the top five. this was the soundtrack to my junior year at mount holyoke, a year that was full of drama but that ultimately ended up solidifying my friendships with the group of girls i call my tet. there is not a song on this album that doesn't call up a vivid memory of that year. 
11) <i>panic at the disco, a fever you can't sweat out</i> : this album isn't so much life changing as that it's the soundtrack to a really important time in my life. (the phrases ""kitchen of 154"" and ""spaceship genre"" are critical as well ;)) 
12) <i>guster, lost and gone forever</i> : i made a point of not listening to this album (or any of guster) when i was in early high school because they were like THE trendy band at the time. but when a friend played this for me i was really hooked. i wouldn't say it changed my life so much as it changed my music taste; this was when i started to care less about identifying with the hard rock / metal scene and just started listening to everything i could lay hands on.
13) <i>eve 6, self titled</i> : this sits right beside maroon 5 as being the soundtrack to that spring and summer of 2004. i'd known some of it before, but this was the first time i had the whole thing, and i was in love. every song on it means something special to me and/or conjures up clear memories of that time, especially 'jesus nite lite' and 'open road song'. i can still put this on any old time and be thrilled to hear it.
14) <i>the cure, greatest hits</i> :  god, i'd always loved the cure, but i didn't know it, lol. this i found used at turn it up for like $3 and it electrified me. i never realized how deeply i loved the sound, the vocals, the lyrics, just everything about it, this sort of 80s punk puts me in the best kind of mood, and this was the album that made me realize it. since then i've made a point of getting to know 
15) <i>red hot chili peppers, by the way</i> : is not my favorite album of RHCP's, but was the first one i ever paid attention to as a whole. i remember it came out the summer i was working with my dad, and there were a few singles that'd be frequently on the radio... i liked the songs so much i started paying more attention to RHCP as a band, and now they're one of my absolute all-time favorites. 
16) <i>smashing pumpkins, mellon collie and the infinite sadness</i> : ahaha sometimes i think the smashing pumpkins (this album specifically) were responsible for the path my music taste took in high school. i bought this the summer after 8th grade and within a month it was the most-listened to cd in my arsenal; made me realize that what i wanted in music by and large was guts and glory, complexity and emotion. it led me to a lot of other bands i probly would never have otherwise known. (i also used to tell people that billy corgan was my cousin and he'd changed the L to an R in his last name cus it sounded cooler. XD)
17) <i>u2, the joshua tree</i> : is sorta tied with 'the unforgettable fire', actually, but since joshua tree was the first u2 album i actually owned, i'm listing it. u2 has been a definitive musical force for me since i first started listening to them, which started gradually my sophomore year of college and hit a peak in my junior and senior years. i own all but a few of their albums, and am pretty much addicted to all of them. the early stuff has that 80s hard rock tone i love, as well as singing about topical issues (always gets me, x-ref tracy chapman, rage, etc) and the late stuff is just... just awesome. there's no word for it. 
18) <i>m & c's, does a body good</i> : i don't think i've ever listened to this album all the way through, lol, but the recording of it was a truly life-changing experience. the m&c's were a huge part of my years at mount holyoke, and that i have tangible proof of how amazing we were is really special to me.
19) <i>paul simon, graceland</i> : one i've been listening to since childhood-- influenced my music taste in a way i probably could never actually plot the course of. he is a true artist, his voice is amazing, and this album never fails to make me think, or make me feel.
20) <i>oasis, what's the story, morning glory?</i> : o hai eighth grade. wow, i was an angsty brat in my early teenage years, and this album was just whiny enough to be perfect for my mood at age 13.
21) <i>snow patrol, eyes open</i> : was the soundtrack to 2006-- i bought it just before my trip to CA to visit suzi, and listened to it pretty much nonstop through getting together with lindsay. surprisingly, lol, i can still listen to it and love it-- his voice slays me, the lyrics are great, and the music just cuts right to my heart. 'set the fire to the third bar' and 'hands open' leave me with an indescribable happy/weepy feeling. :}
22) <i>franz ferdinand, self titled</i> : oh god, do i love crunchy brit rock. i was addicted to this album for a looooooooong ass time, it coincided with my rediscovery of the cure and ushered in a phase of lots of punk-type stuff. like some others, i can't really say how it affected me specifically, except that i remember the time i started listening to it vividly, and it's been a staple of my music taste ever since. 
23) <i>soundtrack, william shakespeare's romeo + juliet</i> : i could still sing every single song on this album today. this movie rocked my little 13-year-old world, and the soundtrack / score (i have both) never fails to sock me in the gut. all the songs on it are good; some are great; 'to you i bestow' by mundy and 'talk show host' by radiohead are very close to my heart. one of the few soundtracks that encouraged me to explore the individual bands that appeared on it ('lost highway' was the other, and probably had more of an effect on my music taste, but as an album that soundtrack is much less memorable)
24) <i>depeche mode, songs of faith and devotion</i> : i fucking love depeche mode. LOVE. this was the first album of theirs i owned, and it encouraged me to really get into them, buy more albums, really get to know them as a band. to date they're still one of my favorites, and though i wore out all the actual discs, i still have aaaaaalll their stuff on my computer, and listen constantly.
25) <i>alanis morissette, jagged little pill</i> : probably most girls my age will list this, but that doesn't stop me. bought it in 7th grade, still listening to it today. loved the lyrics (and ooh! she said fuck!), loved her voice, loved how frank she was about being a fucked up girl looking for her own peace of mind (since i thought of myself as the same, natch). listening to her shooed me toward garbage, no doubt, hole and other girls who rock.
26) <i>elliot smith, xo</i> : is what i listened to for a large part of the time i was coming to terms with being not as straight as i thought i was, ending a 4-year relationship, trying to come out to my parents... it was rough. elliot helped. :}"

"event","listening to clips of protesters at the prop 8 hearings on npr this morning brought me to tears. it's just so hard... the prospect that <i>this</i> is what could set a precedent for the entire country, instead of MA's example being replicated.... and even worse, hearing a woman talk about how she was standing and protesting on the spot where she and her wife were married last year, and how their marriage could be overturned/invalidated if this is upheld.... also, i kind of hope someone kills kenneth starr in his sleep. way to sound like the hugest most pompous uppity conservative cunt in the world. he sounded like he was doing a shitty cool hand luke impression, for chrissakes. ""what we have heaaah... is a failyaah... to unnerstand that homos.. don't.. desuuurve equal rights.."" alskdfjkdj. DIAF.

on the other hand, the dude screaming out ""YOU CAN'T IGNORE A RIGHTEOUS QUEEN"" at the conservative protesters made me laugh my ass off. :}

"event","man, my ipod is loving me this morning. maroon 5, the servant, the bsg cover of 'watchtower' (which i absolutely did NOT listen to three times in a row.... nope...), outkast, elefant, alanis, the chili peppers, the cure, the smiths, and now cobra starship. obviously it missed me these past several weeks. :} it's really annoying that the sound on this computer is broken-- like, it's not just that there aren't speakers attached, i plugged headphones into the tower and still couldn't hear anything. 

i've really been missing music lately... i joined pandora and would really love to be able to actually listen to it at work. the prospect of having new music suggested to me is extremely exciting; i always feel like there's music out there i'm missing, like i hear these songs sometimes and love them, then find out they're actually sort of popular and am like, how did i not know this band existed? i guess i need to listen to the radio more... i just hate the commercials so fucking much, it makes me insane. that is the #1 reason i don't listen to radio other than NPR, honestly-- like if i hear one more commercial for a local accountant or car wash place, i will blow my brains out. idk why they bother me so much, lol, but i really can't stand it.

the other thing that's like, a weird computer glitch that i cannot explain, is that limewire on my desktop flat-out refuses to connect to the server. like it starts up, and i can search stuff, but then it just comes up with no search results. even for things like ...idk, like panic or fallout boy that i know should have 80billion results. i guess i should start torrenting stuff instead... which reminds me i also need to start DLing some tv shows. i need to catch my ass up on things... prison break, the shield, ugly betty and heroes especially. i actually almost miss working at blockbuster when i realize how behind i am on shows i really want to know wtf has been happening on, lol.

<lj-cut text=""brief tr musing / note to self"">brief tr musing / note to self : must do tr soundtrack thing soon. really annoys me that i can't think of songs... have one for fred ('troublemaker' by weezer) and think i just settled on 'science of selling yourself short' by less than jake for sandor, just for lack of aaaaaaaany other songs that might possibly be about him ('the stranger' by billy joel being way too obvious, lol).... phedre i could choose one of many things, but i'd like to pick something that's really island-her as opposed to canon-her. same w/jon; idk why but 'viva la vida' by coldplay reminds me of him, the lyrics are not really right but whenever i listen to it i think about him. soooo yeah, pondering. and taking suggestions. :D</lj-cut>

also, speaking of tv... idk where i'm going to be during the BSG finale, but if i'm at a computer, i'm thinking about having a chat room to flail with other similarly-minded people... any takers? :D"

"event","<lj-cut text=""behind the cut"">okay... so, here are my reactions to tonight's episode, prioritized as best as i could make them.

1. hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolyshit kara. <lj user=genjadeshade> was clearly quite fucking correct about her predictions... i am speechless. i literally got full-body shuddering chills when the piano duet segued into 'watchtower'... that song will never not completely murder me with awesome.

2. wow, chief and boomer. just... wow. i literally don't know where to begin. the house... projection... like someone said in <lj user=fahrbot>'s journal, she played him like kara's daddy played the piano. but auuuuggghh, so fucking breaky. i've always wanted that for them... but obviously, i mean it's no secret one of the themes of the show is you don't get to have your happy ending. ;__;

3. so it seems pretty clear that in order to keep galactica alive, they're going to have to turn it into a base-star-type ship, and it seems equally clear that anders is going to be the hybrid for it. on the one hand, fucking awesome, symbolic merge of cylon and human. on the other hand, i was (foolishly) hoping anders would wake up again. even if he was sort of a zucchini in the head.... but maybe i just like aphasia as a character trait. :P

4. what the fuck does cavil want hera for? i can't figure it out. i mean i know that's probably one of the things we're not supposed to be able to figure out... but man, i really just can't wait for cavil to get pwned hardcore. 

5. come on roslin... i mean okay, sure, you were right about boomer... but who are you to lecture anyone on emotion getting the better of you? 

6. trailer for next week.... i really hope that's not chief going out the vacuum... also really not looking forward to another papadama sobbing moment... those break me worse than almost anything. n___n;;; 

thoughts? discuss with me people. *cliiiing*"

"event","wow.... jo-jo's stepping down at the end of next school year. i mean i guess i didn't expect her to stay president forever, but i didn't expect her to be stepping down just five years after i graduated.... it's weird, idk, i'm not sure how to imagine mhc without her. she and her foolish dog were such a staple of campus life.... and the number of cigarettes i stubbed on her front doorstep during the year i lived in pearsons, man.. countless. her successor's got some seriously enormous shoes to fill.

and i'm sure i'm not alone (<lj user=nickhornby> and <lj user=rhealitycheck> at the very least will join me) in remembering her best for the 10 rules.... one foot on the floor, ladies....

oh yeah, and the GRE went okay. i was really shocked to have the essay parts be first, but i guess it was good cus by the time i got to the end (of course there were two math sections... of COURSE) my brain was totally mushy (like a ripe banana... a cottage-cheese-like mush, if you will) so i'd probably have fucked up the essays  completely if they'd been last. as it was i was surprised by how well i did on the math... though my total score was seriously only 50 points higher than my SAT scores were... to review, both times i took the SAT i got the same score but w/different distribution of points.... finally one area of life in which consistency is actually my strong suit.... 

okay... actually going to church w/mom tonight... can't pass up the chance to hear the female bishop speak.

"event","an update. one that's not comprised of a few hundred twitter musings, that is. :}

but first, some humor: some of you know that i love <a href=""http://someecards.com"">someecards.com</a> with unrestrained ferocity. if you've never been, go now. today on their user-created cards forum i found the perfect e-card for chuck bass. with a picture of a woman looking thoughtfully into an empty glass, the caption said, ""i never understood economic recession until i saw a bottle of smirnoff where the grey goose should've been."" aaaaand i LOLed. XD

so, somewhere over the past few weeks i decided it was time to apply to graduate school. like, actually time, not just time to think about it. i knew i didn't have time to put together a creative writing portfolio (since i don't have anything current with which to assemble one) so i decided to set my sights on something that would- gasp!- actually find me employment. (something i've found difficult thus far, as <lj user=ardavana> and <lj user=gloriouselysium> so tactfully reminded me during their radio show on my last night of classes at MHC by playing 'what do you do with a BA in english' from avenue Q... thanks guys ;)) i've always thought seriously about going to school for library science, and what with <lj user=lauralyrics> and my oldest family friend having gone thru simmons' library science program and unreservedly raved about it, i'm applying. best library science program in the country, wot? :D i'll be going for a masters of library science with a concentration in school librarianship, since i love YA lit and have often also considered getting certified to teach high school english. anyway. so. barring a few tiny minor obstacles (mhc won't release my transcript b/c they claim i owe them money, one of my would-be reference-letter-writers hasn't gotten back to me about whether or not he can write-- you know, trivial shit like that x__x) by the end of next week everything'll be in. quite possibly within the next few months i could actually have some FOCUS to my life! :D

oh yeah, and i'm taking the GRE next wednesday. if it wasn't for <lj user=ceilidh> having sent me her GRE for dummies book i'd probably be sitting under my desk gibbering right about now. >.&lt; 

so wish me luck. i think i might treat myself to 'taken' tomorrow if i can get through an entire GRE practice test tonight. good reward, i think, no? :D that's if my combination PMS-onset-of-the-flu double whammy doesn't take me out at the knees.... why, body, why do you choose to hate me at the most inopportune times in the world? -.-;;;;;

also..... anyone wishing to commiserate on bsg... i have been wholly without people to rave and flail to after the past few eps, and tonight i think i'm gonna need it. :P"

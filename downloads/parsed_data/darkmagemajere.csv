"event","I have a big problem with the RIAA and MPAA now. <br /><br />For those of you not familiar with the issue, there's a big battle going on across the Internet and in courtrooms around the world, between the media production corporations and people who download and distribute media products like music and movies outside the current market scheme, whether for free or for profit. The reason for the battle is that the &quot;illicit&quot; distribution going on is taking away from the profits of these media conglomerates, because they have not grasped the extent of how the Internet has changed the way people do business. <br /><br />The people who are advocating file-sharing do so for various reasons, whether because they like getting things for free, or whether they're fighting to get the media giants to realize that the dated model they're using where the artists they're representing get a tiny piece of the sales of their own music, or whether it's an expression of anarchy, or whether, or whether... <br /><br />I, personally, would like a scheme where, instead of paying $20 for a CD or $1 to an online distributor, I get the music for free and pay directly to the artists what I think is an acceptable compensation. Radiohead has done this recently and have made a good bit of money from this experiment. Straight to them, no middle-men between the band and the fans. <br /><br />Sadly, the media giants don't think this is a good idea because it doesn't guarantee them profits at all...in fact, it makes them irrelevant insofar as they're making money directly off of the transactions. They would be relegated to doing business fairly with the artists and taking much less off the top of lopsided contracts. <br /><br />What has me upset is that now the RIAA and MPAA and IFPI, which are PR organizations of these media corporations, have set their sights on the Internet itself, by attempting to make laws against doing things on the Internet which have to do with file-sharing (which itself is neither legal or illegal, it's what you download and share), and with Internet access. <br /><br />While it hasn't been explicitly stated, it's my impression that these organizations have jumped into bed with the ISPs in order to find ways to preserve the models that have been in use for thirty years or more, which are being threatened by wide-scale distribution opportunities. Broadband ISPs are now instituting bandwidth caps and usage fees in order to stave off file-sharing and preserve the bundled Pay-TV and VoIP that are offered by most of the ISPs. Time Warner, COX, AT&amp;T and Comcast are all considering these plans, and Time Warner was recently backed down from instituting these pay-for-access plans by the end of April. <br /><br />I am a big proponent of the concept of net neutrality, in the main because, due to the Internet, I have far more access to the kinds of news that I consider important to know, as opposed to the kinds of news that TV, newspapers and magazines consider important for me to know. There is a lot more accountability to the more &quot;traditional&quot; news sources, as well as many more news sources for niche interests, and (right now at least) most of it only costs the access fee for the Internet. It is much more an age of information than it was only 20 years ago. And by trying to avoid having to adapt to a new reality, these corporations are threatening this beautiful thing. <br /><br />As a response, and because it perfectly matches my new outlook on what needs to happen, I submit the following quote, taken from <a href=""http://torrentfreak.com/why-pirates-buy-more-music-and-music-labels-fail-090428/"">TorrentFreak</a>: (edited for grammar)<br /><br /><em>Despite studies showing that extending copyright will only benefit the labels and a few artists who are already at the &ldquo;top&rdquo; AND cost the citizens of the EU millions PLUS lock away culture for more generations, the move to extend copyright on sound works for 20&nbsp;more&nbsp;years has been approved&hellip;. and there is no reason why it wont be extended again before those 20 years are up. <br /><br />Coincidence that the Beatles and other classic rock acts of the 60s were just about to come into the public domain? <br /><br />While I largely agree with this article,&nbsp;I for one dont want the labels to listen,&nbsp;and I dont care what they do. I&rsquo;m just waiting for them to die; no other ending is acceptable. <br /><br />I download anything and everything&nbsp;I want, but&nbsp;I never buy unless the artist is listed&nbsp;as RIAA-free or is from a small indie company (I do take the time to google before putting my money down).&nbsp;That's the only way to get these scum out of our systems. <br /><br />Take all they have to offer, but make sure they dont get a dime from you--it's actually a simple reversal of what they were doing to us. Let's see how valuable their bought laws and &lsquo;copyrights&rsquo; are then. <br /><br />Trying to work with them or make them change their evil ways&nbsp;is useless, and so is picketing or taking legal alternatives because they have pockets so deep all of us put together wouldnt be able to match them half way. The courts are a joke (The PirateBay trial, anyone?) even in far off countries&hellip;in the US, forget it! That's home territory.<br /><br />Hit them hard and don't stop even when they are down, then hit them a few extra times when they are dead&hellip; just to be sure.</em> <br />"

"event","I just had an epiphany as to why topics like abortion and gay marriage arouse such insane passion among the American Christian community.And my caveat here, of course, is that this is a generalization and individuals do not necessarily live this way.<br /><br />American Christians, as a majority, are suffering from a case of closed-mindedness that is just stunning in its narrowness. To them, apparently, it's not just the matter of God's laws being broken. It's much more sinister. They have a fundamental, bedrock inability to believe that all of us are not Christian, no matter what we may profess to think or believe. Jew, Muslims, atheists--they're all Christian deep down. And that's what makes these things so offensive to them: they are incensed at the fact that Christians would so willingly break God's laws, <i>knowing </i>that these laws are not to be broken. <br /><br />To these people, morality is tied to following God's laws willingly. If you're a good person who acts ethically, then you must be a good Christian. Atheists, evolution supporters, Muslims, and liberals are all incapable of acting with good intent because they are, in fact, bad Christians who reject God's laws. It is, <b>literally</b>, black and white. I've seen Christians react to something good that I've done for them, and it fuses their wiring for a few hours. I've seen it in their eyes, trying to understand how someone who breaks God's laws willingly could still act selflessly and with goodwill. They go away with a look in their eyes like they've been betrayed...and then the next day act as if it never happened.<br /><br />This is dangerous mental behavior. People who act in this manner have been institutionalized for being delusional. And we, as a country apparently, look up to this kind of thing in order to have faith in something. It's enough to shake <i>my</i> own faith...which is grounded in humanity."

"event","<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071206-youtube-users-prefer-lousy-science-over-the-real-deal.html"">This article</a> is indicative of a trend that I've noticed has been growing at an exponential rate since it started in the early 60's: namely, that the public body is increasingly distrustful of information that comes from ""official"" sources such as the government and leading industry associations. More and more, there seems to be a disconnect between how intelligent and aware the American public <b>is</b>, and how intelligent and aware the government and industry associations seem to think we are.<br /><br />I was listening to <a href=""http://wamu.org/programs/dr/"">Diane Rehm</a> today on the way to work, and a caller came on and asked about the mainstream media enabling the Bush administration to go to war not only in Afghanistan, but Iraq...and one of her commentators said something like, ""I can't tell you how many times I've heard this kind of idea, but it's absolutely not true, and I'm willing to bet, of the points the caller brings up, he most likely heard about them from the mainstream media outlets.""<br /><br />This is an offensively patronizing stance to take on the subject, since a growing number of people get their news from the Internet. I, myself, use the Internet and NPR as my only means of getting information. I do this because I am aware of the fact that mainstream media outlets such as network and cable news and newspapers and magazines have to use an infrastructure in order to get their information out through their chosen medium. And, increasingly, the groups and companies that control said infrastructure are political in nature. Which means basically that if a particular newspaper or cable news channel puts out a story or info that their controlling interests don't like, those interests can pull money from the outlet itself, or put pressure on the person or people responsible for that story to ensure that only the news that's beneficial for them to present to the public at large.<br /><br />Professional journalists and watchdog citizens are offended by the politicization of the media infrastructure, and are finding that they have an audience starved for unedited news on the Internet. I am part of that audience, and after utilizing this invaluable resource, I am disgusted at most of the drivel that comes across as valid news in traditional media outlets. These politicians and corporate media barons are losing influence over the public as more and more people go online and find that they now have access to news that is downplayed or ignored through traditional channels. And as they refuse to see that the public <b>is</b> intelligent and <b>is </b>aware, and can see through the smokescreen when we're given goggles, their position is finite.<br /><br />And good riddance, say I."

"event","So the Intelligent Design crowd has been <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/intelligent-design-rebranding.ars"">beaten back</a> and all the evolutionists can rejoice!<br /><br />...But wait a second. Is this really the good thing it's cracked up to be? Isn't science supposed to be about taking a step back and studying the possibilities thoroughly before disregarding a hypothesis...? In that light, there's an aspect of the ID argument that bears looking into. That is the fact that some ID supporters are calling for evolution and ID to be equally covered in schoolbooks.<br /><br />There's something to be said for the ""evolution"" of the argument for what used to be creationism. Creationism supported the religious (read: <b>Christian</b>) perspective that the universe, and everything included, was created how the Bible teaches it--that GodChristWeh took 6 days to make everything just so, then rested on the Sabbath and that was it. This ""theory"" (because the barking CC crowd swears it's truth) drives evolution supporters up a wall because there's little to no scientific evidence to support it. At the same time, creationists will give no credence to the mounting evidence that supports the prospect of evolution. They're apples and oranges, as far as both groups are concerned.<br /><br />Or are they? This is where Intelligent Design comes in. Seeing that creationism was losing ground in the fight over where we came from, some of the more scientifically-minded religious bolts (because, unlike the nuts, at least they're <i>thinking</i>) took a look at how they could spin their favorite into something that has at least a chance of persuading the masses that it's true. What they came up with is a theory which posits a universe that is so well-formed it couldn't possibly have come from a chaotic system...that some form of intelligence had a hand in setting the rules to get our cosmos (and our puny, life-ridden Earth) where it is today.<br /><br />This was a brilliant redesign of a worn-out theory that was supported mainly by a worn-out religious system. Its most ingenious intent was to throw a wrench of doubt into the gears of evolution and spark a debate. And it most certainly has. The trial in Dover was a win for evolutionists because it exposed the <i>modus operandi</i> of the more zealous supporters of ID theory: they want to use ID to crush evolution through FUD and then get back to creationism. However, I think both groups have a surprise in store. This is the fact that intelligent design is a sound theory in and of itself.<br /><br />There's no way to prove or disprove either creationism or intelligent design to the satisfaction of anyone involved. That is because we lack the means to conclusively prove any one of these theories as the truth. Creationism should be buried, as it is Christian-centric and determined to stay that way. Intelligent design, however, stands as a valid hypothesis for two very important reasons: it is a neutral theory in that it doesn't sit in any one particular camp, and it is completely compatible with evolution.<br /><br />The groups that support only the evolutionary theory were beating creationism by using scientific reasoning to support their argument; by saying, in effect, that they had solid evidence that supported evolution, while the only thing creationists could point to was Charles Darwin recanting on his deathbed. Now, however, evolutionists are starting to sound like the very people they are hell-bent on defeating in this debate. (Sorry, couldn't resist!)<br /><br />It's hard to decry their reasoning when they denounce ID theory, because it is being offered up by the same people who want I AM to be the only source and purpose for existence. But evolutionists, because of the circumstances by which ID theory was introduced, are not focusing on the theory itself and examining it with the same method by which they arrived at evolution as the more likely scenario. The mechanics of evolution are well-known and easily proved; the means by which those mechanisms began are not. Intelligent design can sit comfortably on top of evolution as a way of looking at how things began, and for some in the evolution camp it's an uncomfortable marriage. But I ask anyone who claims reason as the filter through which they see the world: Say there is a (divine?) intelligence that set everything in motion. Who's to say, then, that the intelligence involved didn't set evolution as the engine by which our cosmos would function?<br /><br />This question works against the crowd who see ID theory as a tool to put God back on top. They want evolution gone, because the Bible doesn't mention it. But they let the genie out, so to speak, and now they have to deal with an idea that can work against them. Them being the fundamentalists who want Christianity as the only measure of faith, of course. Intelligent design is agnostic for the purpose of naming that intelligence; it was understood by the religious right to mean Christianity, but it could easily apply to Brahman, Allah...even the Force, for that matter.<br /><br />And now we get down to the crux of why the original debate was so heated to begin with: faith. These two groups--religious fundamentalists and die-hard scientists, many of whom might possibly be atheist--have taken so much of the spotlight that they've left an important group to twiddle their thumbs collectively. This group can see both theories as being true simultaneously, and don't understand what the fuss is about. I include myself in this group, as I believe there can be such an intelligence without having to put a dogma to it and can also see said intelligence using evolution as the means of keeping our universe dynamic. Religious nuts don't like to believe this, but it is in fact possible to have a reasoned turn of mind and still be able to look at things and see them from a spiritual point of view. Buddhism and Zen could be considered examples of this. <br /><br />The middle of the road has been downplayed in this fight, even though one side has, perhaps inadvertently, pulled its viewpoint closer to the middle than it may have anticipated. It remains for the other side to accept the validity of ID theory and apply scientific reasoning to it impartially. If all goes well, it's very possible that evolution and intelligent design could eventually merge into a unified theory whereby God caused life to evolve into its present state. If that happens, maybe this pointless debate could end and we can focus our collective energy on something that's actually important."

The wooden deck was completely underwater. As much as I like the view and the quiet, I think it's time to move on.

Speaking of, Gloria's finally gotten a time to be out here! She's leaving out on the 16th, and I'll be meeting her at the airport that afternoon. As much as I'd like to see her sooner, I'm glad it got pushed back. The apartment's nowhere near ready to be lived in. It still needs to be cleaned, and I couldn't get any furniture moved in last weekend like I'd hoped, due to the rain and my brother's truck breaking down on him. But there's really not much to do, besides clean the floors and the kitchen and airing the place out. I was planning on getting some boxes over there yesterday, but with the flood coming out of the sky I figured it might be a better use of my car to be off the streets. Today after work, though, that place is getting the treatment!"

Like spoiled children, they want what they feel they must have without any consideration of what it costs other people...even their own employees. Not to mention the sense of entitlement that big business feels is its only due for supporting the masses with their ""largesse"".<br /><br />One of the worst traits of American society is the pressure to succeed. It's an artificial pressure, and it drives people to do what they think they must to reach the top, even at the cost of ignoring civil and sometimes even personal responsibility. I look to Europe for the types of behaviors better-adjusted cultures exhibit, such as the spirit of <i>carpe diem&nbsp; </i>that engrosses smaller towns and villages across their continent. We, as a nation, could stand to take one or two of those lessons to heart."

When I saw Tasha off to Denver, I was not looking to have her replaced or anything. But not even 3 days after, I met Gloria. She's from California, and she was coming down to meet with J. I can't explain what happened between us except that we clicked. Feelings progressed really quickly, and we've been talking to each other since then. She's moving down to Florida, and we're going to share a place to live.

I can't explain how things have turned upside-down so quickly; I can't deny my feelings and it doesn't feel wrong the way things are progressing with Gloria...but I hate the fact that it seems like I've dropped a long relationship to just dive into someone else's arms. I told Tasha about it last night. Before I hung up, I got the feeling that I'd just shattered her day, and it made me feel like the lowest person in the world. 

The last thing I want to do is cause pain to people I care about, and I still care about Tasha. The only thing that's changed between us is the nature of our relationship with each other, as far as I'm concerned. But I know that she was still fully in the relationship while I was slowly being pushed out. It's hard to understand that kind of thing if you're not going through it, and I tried so hard to keep it together, but I couldn't. I don't know what kind of person that makes me...weak, I suppose some might say.

But I wasn't expecting to find someone so soon after Tasha left. I wasn't really wanting anything to do with anyone when I met Gloria. Things just...clicked. And I'm not ashamed of that, because it feels like something meant to happen, and I'm happy. And I want to still talk to Tasha and be friends with her, because she's very cool that way, and we've had lots of fun together. I hope this will pass for her, but if it's anything like my experience with Joy, it's gonna take a long time. But I'll be here for her when she needs me, because that's what friends do for each other."

She's already got clients out the wazoo, and I'm assuming she's getting good money for each session. I wish her the best of luck, and I'm a little envious because at least she has a direction toward which she can move.

Myself, I'm at work an hour early because, for the second night in a row, I slept in my car rather than go back to the house at which I'm staying. Why? It was hot and uncomfortable in the car--I had to keep turning the car on to get the a/c running and cool things off, goddam humidity--but the alternative, to me, was worse. I was on the same side of town as my job, and I have no privacy where I'm staying. I am a couch-surfer at present, and I can't stand it. Plus, my current residence is on the other side of town from where I was, and right now gas is equivalent to water for my survival. I <b>hate</b> making that comparison, but if it wasn't true I wouldn't do it.

Don't get me wrong. The guy I'm staying with has been super-nice in letting me stay there for almost 2 months without a job. He's been very gracious, but at the same time I've been on a couch for 3 months and I'm going bug-fucking-nuts. I'm working 2 jobs just for the chance that I can afford a place of my own. In fact, just yesterday at the law school which is my second job, I had someone pass me a card for some cheap apartments on the south side of Jacksonville, pretty close to where some friends are staying. It's sounding like a good deal, and I can't decide if I should go for that...or suck it up and save everything I can for a move out west. I've been aching to go back since I had to move to Florida again. Right now, the place of my own is sounding <i>really</i> appealing, just because I've never had that before. But I miss my friends in Arizona so much. I haven't felt as at-home in so long as I felt out there, and it felt damn good.

Maybe a decision will present itself as I toss them around in the backfield of my haid."

I'm not a religious person. I prefer to think that everyone will find his or her spiritual relief on their own terms. However that happens is a personal experience that will uplift any particular person and exalt their lives so that everything will take on a special glow and significance that said person will have never noticed before. For some, this is religion (or spiritual practice); for some, it is family; and for still others, it is romantic love.

I never really used to think of myself as a romantic person. All my relationships, I've never been in a position where I could do things that I consider romantic: flying someone to a specific location to share a sunset, <i>etc</i>, <i>ad nauseum</i>. But one thing I've always believed to be an incredibly romantic, yet invariably underestimated trait is for someone in a relationship is an absolute trust that's placed in the other person. This is a bond that is unshakable unless shaken by the other person; in fact that could be the only thing that would be able to shake a trust of that magnitude.

Maybe I'm a naif, but I always start friendships and relationships that way. I put absolute, implicit trust in the other person, unless and until they do something to betray that trust. Thereafter, it's hard to get back to the same place with that person, no matter how much I might want to.

I guess I wear my heart on my sleeve, but what other way is there to experience a passionate relationship with <i>anyone</i>?"

Tasha and I are moving into our new apartment next weekend! We looked at the place today; it's a 1 bedroom on Riverside Ave. here in Jax, almost across from St. Vincent's Hospital. The rent is right, and both of us are more than ready.

And it's been amazing today--the way we've been with each other since Tasha came over has been like it was when we first got together. It's made me realize that our relationship has pretty much been on hold up to this point. Even though we've been talking <i>at</i> each other almost every day for the last 5 months, we haven't really been talking <i>to</i> each other very much. We were both giddy and had goofy grins on our faces from the moment we went to look at the place. Afterward, we went to the Casbah to celebrate. We had kabobs with baba gannoush, stuffed grape leaves and falafel. Very nice dinner, and the place is also a hookah lounge! Tasha thought she was allergic to smoke, but we went to this place with our friend Jacqui on Friday night and packed a hookah, and we were all puffing away. It really is a totally different tobacco experience compared to coffin-nails and monkey dicks: it's pure tobacco that's been compacted and soaked in different flavors such as fruits, mint and even cola. (I don't think I'll try the cola, but everything else is cool. :)

So yeah--finally getting our first place together after almost 3 years ""together"". November 3rd can't get here fast enough!"

My plan was to leave all the bullshit back in Florida, including the behaviors that were keeping me from doing anything worthwhile with my life. Instead, I find myself in my room most of the time, doing fuck-all on this expensive plaything I call my computer. They have been gracious hosts, and I feel I have not repaid them in kind. I haven't even done things you normally must when moving to another state. I just now got my own mailing address for AZ, and I've been here for almost 5 months. Even the things I've wanted to do, like go to the park and draw...I can't seem to compel myself to leave the house.

I look at other people making the decisions that change and better their lives, and I can't seem to make them myself. I marvel at other people who aren't emotionally strong, but can still make these decisions. It's not even like these are big decisions all the time, either...everyday things. Am I afraid of life? Is that it?...I suppose it must be. I wanted to be in my own place by now--hell, to be honest I've wanted that since before I moved out from my parents'. I want to have a place for Tasha and I to call ours, but I'm paralyzed, almost, when it comes to putting these plans in motion. Is my self-esteem really so low? Am I really so afraid of fucking up that I'm terrified of trying <i>anything</i>? How pathetic. I've heard it before, and I think it myself. It's utterly impossible to describe how such a mental state exists knowingly; I know, I've tried. 

People who have not experienced this can not comprehend it. They say, ""You just do these things."" To which I've invariably responded: ""How?"" And they see it as a cop-out. <i>I</i> see it as a cop-out. And yet the problem persists. I wish I knew why, because then maybe I could figure out how to whittle this block down. Because it's leading me down a path I don't like the look of. I had a friend who hit this state years ago, and he turned to drugs and never looked back. Similarly, for anyone familiar with Alice in Chains, Layne Staley's lyrics sound eerily familiar...as if I could have wrote them had I had the inclination first.

The complete abortion that is FEMA; the blame tossing between federal and Louisiana state authorities over the levee situation; the ""outrage"" over the looting and rioting in New Orleans, even though most of the looting was for food and clothing; and the lack of emergency response to affected areas of the Gulf Coast, even now...things like this should not even be issues in a democracy that is based on the rights and safety of its citizens. Instead, not only does it exist, but our elected officials see fit to throw billions of dollars to a war that was supposed to be over 12 months ago (and is only being sustained for our resource interests in the area), and uses the chaos of a calamity for millions of people to throw a huge bone in energy initiatives to the energy industry, lowering environmental standards and giving tax breaks to a sector that is essential, and therefore guaranteed to collect their dues from their customers.

And if all this isn't a kick in the ethical coinpurse, an alleged story came to my attention about church congregations from the Missouri/Arkansas area bussing down to New Orleans and dressing as displaced natives in order to get FEMA credits for cash. These are supposed to be the moral standard-bearers of our society; what does it say when the people who follow the laws of God...don't?

"event","It has been a fascinating and tiring two weeks that just passed. For everyone who didn't know, I've moved to Arizona from Florida. I'm staying with my friends Amber and John, who have been inviting me to come out and stay with them ever since I helped Amber move out here a few years back. I had a few reasons for doing so. My beloved Tasha is out here, in Denver; Amber has been a really good friend to me, and John as well--they helped me get back to Florida; and, well...because I've just grown tired of the southeast area. I've lived there most of my life, and (my friends and family excepted) the people have just become constipated when it comes to things like, oh--I don't know--compassion and civility?

Out here already, I've seen evidence that, in general, westerners seem to be focused more on the things about life that I am. The newspaper in Denver is a prime example: compared to the Florida <i>Times-Union</i>, the Denver <i>Post</i> is a flaming hotbed of liberal propaganda. Which, considering the T-U is the same, only conservative, I don't feel too bad about it.

I hope I haven't caused any of my friends any feelings of resentment. It's a move I've been planning to make for almost a year now...but the execution was a bit sudden, and I wasn't able to see everyone I wanted to see before I left. You know who you are, and I apologize. I still care about you a great deal, and it wasn't personal, only a time factor.

I still don't have a phone yet, but I'm getting a calling card while I'm out this weekend. Amber and John are in the SCA, and they're taking me to a ""war"" gathering. Hopefully it'll be fun. Considering how into fantasy I am, I think I'll take to it. And when I get back on Monday, I'll be calling everyone to let them know I'm OK, and what's been going on."

<i>You would know, wouldn't you?
You extend your hand to those who suffer
To those who know what it really feels like
To those who've had a taste, like that means something
And oh, so sick I am
And maybe I don't have a choice
And maybe this is all I have
And maybe this is a cry for help"

"event","Two dreams in one night. Woohoo!

The first dream involved me being associated somehow with the Justice League. I had no superpowers whatsoever, yet I knew things that I shouldn't. They were confused, and ran a whole bunch of tests on me. Then, at the end of the dream, two heroes decided they needed to return home--Thor and Baeldur. (Don't ask.) The end of that dream was like a comic: a panel showing them flying into space.

The second dream involved Karyn. I was riding with her in some town that resembled Jacksonville in some places, but definitely not in others. We were riding to pick her boyfriend up. We were arguing about her kicking me out the whole time, and it wasn't good-natured arguing either...more like yelling. But for some reason I stayed in the car. Anyway, we passed a street and I saw my computer in the middle of the road, hooked up and running. I asked her to stop so I could pick it up, and she said something along the lines of ""if you wanted to keep it you shouldn't have left it out."" Real hardass parent type of stuff. Then when we pick her boyfriend up, he's like 16 or something--really young. That's when the alarm went off."

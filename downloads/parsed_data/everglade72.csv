Yesterday, Dad's work had a company picnic at <a href=""http://www.lionsafari.com/"" target=""_blank"">African Lion Safari</a>, located about an hour and a half outside Toronto.&nbsp; The picnic part of it wasn't bad.&nbsp; I didn't really meet that many people because everyone was busy setting up or cooking or whatnot.&nbsp; The zoo brought in an elephant to play tug-o-war with.&nbsp; The elephant was 8,900 pounds and playing tug-o-war with it was pointless but fun.&nbsp; Every time the elephant pulled, piles of people went flying.&nbsp; Due to it's sheer strength and the type of rope they used, as soon as it started hurting my hands, I let go which turned out to be each time that my mother-in-law took a picture.&nbsp; LOL.

My favorite part was when we went through the baboon area.&nbsp; In this park you can either drive your own vehicle through the zoo or take the bus.&nbsp; You literally get right up to the animals and they often come right up to your vehicles.&nbsp; In the baboon area, there are literally around 50 or so baboons and they come right up and hop onto your vehicles.&nbsp; The baboons are highly curious and quite destructive creatures.&nbsp; We watched them rip off windshield seals, decorative stripping on the side of cars, radio antennas and much more from vehicles.&nbsp; They ride your vehicles the entire way through their area which is quite big.&nbsp; I would have happily rode around over and over in that area all day; it was so much fun.&nbsp; The other zone where curious animals come up to your vehicles was the zone with the zebras and giraffes, like the baboons, they walk right up to your vehicle and check you out while blocking traffic at the same time.&nbsp; 

We had a lot of fun but all that time in the sun sapped our energy and gave most of us migraines.&nbsp; We were very happy to finally get home.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there was no time for sleep to get rid of those migraines.&nbsp; It was time to head to <A href=""http://www.jackastors.com/dev/"" target=""_blank"">Jack Astor's </a>for dinner.&nbsp; I have to say we were disappointed.&nbsp; They changed their menu again and got pretty cheap.&nbsp; You used to get an order of Garlic Pan Bread (which is awesome stuff) with your entree but now they charge you for it.&nbsp; They reduced the portions of the meals and raised the prices.&nbsp; I can't say that we will be returning to this place anymore.&nbsp; &nbsp; I ordered the Three Peppercorn Grilled Chicken Rigatoni, as usual, which is rigatoni pasta tossed with fresh garlic and peppercorn sauce, topped with herb-grilled chicken and bacon.&nbsp; It is really good but it is supposed to be drenched in the sauce and they put so little on it that most of the pasta didn't have any sauce on it despite my efforts to spread what little sauce there was.

After our disappointing dinner, we headed to Blockbuster and rented <a href=""http://www.coldmountainmovie.com/"" target=""_blank"">Cold Mountain</a> and <a href=""http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/underworld/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Underworld</a>.&nbsp; We saw Cold Mountain last night.&nbsp; I thought it was an ok drama.&nbsp; I didn't think that it earned the awards that it received nor the nominations but it wasn't a bad movie just not all that great.&nbsp; Ryan and Dad hated it.

By the time the movie ended, our already exhausted bodies were completely wiped out and we headed to bed and passed out."

"event","I have been a faithful user of IE browsers since the early versions but I have to admit, I installed the new <a href=""http://texturizer.net/firefox/download.html"" target=""_blank"">Mozilla Firefox 0.9</a> and WOW, it is nice.&nbsp; One of my favorite features is the tabs.&nbsp; Instead of opening a new browser window all the time, I can tell it to open a new tab.&nbsp; It totally cuts down on all the quickbar clutter at the bottom of my screen and keeps things organized.&nbsp; I can even rearrange the tabs to move them into any order that I desire.&nbsp; Further, it will remember what tabs are open so if I crash or want to get back to that site(s), I can do so easily.

It has over a hundred extentions (mini-applications) within it to allow for extended features such as a built in calculator and calendar.&nbsp; For those who like to save their passwords for various sites in their browser, you can easily and quickly see which sites have your password saved in the options screen.&nbsp; No, it won't tell you what the passwords are, but it will show you what site(s) it has one saved for.&nbsp; It also tracks your download history, has a built in pop-up blocker, automatically keeps itself updated with it's ""Smart Update"" feature. This browser has all the options that you wished IE or Netscape had and more that you could never dream possible.&nbsp;  The best part is that it asks you in the installation what your old browser program was and can import all your bookmarks, history, cookies, etc.  I would defiantely recommend it to all my friends.&nbsp;"

"event","Last night, Ryan, Amanda, Geordan and I watched 50 First Dates.&nbsp; What a great movie.&nbsp; When I wasn't laughing so hard that I thought I might tinkle in my panties, I was crying from the touching scenes.&nbsp; We really love that movie.&nbsp; Well... Geordan would have liked it if he hadn't fallen asleep within the first 10 minutes.&nbsp; Poor guy has been working himself to death.&nbsp; I would definately recommend watching it if you hadn't.&nbsp; 

Honestly, I thought it would turn out to be as stupid as ""Along Came Polly"" but it really impressed me.&nbsp; I didn't expect it to be so good and we have happily burned a copy of it for future viewing.

This week, I also cut my hair (back to shoulder length) and dyed it, well... temporarily dyed it.&nbsp; I used a temp dye that only lasts about a month just to see if I would like the color.&nbsp; It is a very deep auburn color.&nbsp; While the color looks nice, I was hoping for something a little lighter.&nbsp; This color came out far, far darker than my natural color.&nbsp; My hair is normally a light to medium brown with gold and red natural highlights.&nbsp; Now it is a very, very dark brown with tons of red highlights but you don't see the red except in the sunlight so it kinda defeats the purpose.&nbsp; Ryan and Amanda like it but I am not a fan.&nbsp; Thank goodness I chose the temporary dye.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; I haven't dyed my hair since just before I joined the Air Force in 1991.&nbsp; What I have decided is that I simply like my natural hair color.&nbsp; It suits me.

That's about everything going on in my life right now.&nbsp; Have fun everyone."

"event","Since I am in Canada now, I figured it is only right that I celebrate their holidays.&nbsp; In honor of Canada Day, here are some Canadian things for everyone.

<font color=""#ff0000""><b>The Canadian Anthem</b></font>

O Canada!
Our home and native land! 
True patriot love in all thy sons* command. 
With glowing hearts we see thee rise, 
The True North strong and free! 
From far and wide, 
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. 
God keep our land glorious and free! 
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. 
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

<b><font color=""#ff0000"">Facts:</font></b> 

On July 1, 2004 
Canada will celebrate it's 137th year since Confederation. 
Before 1982 Canada Day had been known as Dominion Day, First of July, Confederation Day, and July the First. 

Canada Day celebrates the events that occurred on July 1, 1867, when the British North America Act created the Canadian federal government. The BNA Act proclaimed ""one Dominion under the name of Canada,"" hence the original title of the holiday, ""Dominion Day."" Dominion Day was officially renamed ""Canada Day"" by an Act of Parliament on October 27, 1982. This change reflected the policy of successive governments to down play Canada's colonial origins.

Canada's national celebration is always observed on July 1, unless that date falls on a Sunday, in which case it is observed the following day. 

On June 22, 1980, Canada officially adopted ""O Canada"" as their National Anthem

So there you go, there are a few things about Canada and their Independence.&nbsp; Enjoy."

"event","WOW, what a weekend.&nbsp; Friday night was Adult Championships, somehow during the last game a fight broke out due to a couple smart mouths so the Championships ended on a bit of a sour note.&nbsp; We didn't arrive home until nearly midnight and it took all of us about an hour to wind down before we could go to bed.

Bright and early at 5am on Saturday morning, we all got a wake-up call to get ready to leave for the Children's Championships. Ugh!&nbsp; Four hours sleep!&nbsp; So we wake up, fight over the shower for a bit, load up the van, and head out by 5:50am.&nbsp; We arrive at the park at 5:55am.&nbsp; From that point until 7pm, we are outside working the Championships.&nbsp; I was helping to run the snack tent, selling coffee, candy, chips, soda, water and hot dogs.

The first game of the day was the Squirt girls, Jessica's team (sitting in last place with only one win the entire season) against the second place team.&nbsp; Holy cow!&nbsp; What an amazing game!&nbsp; Jessie's team had a lot of heart and they played like they had never played before.&nbsp; The game runs for 7 innings but at the end of the second inning, they were tied and went into extra innings.&nbsp; Three additional innings later, Jessica's team WON!&nbsp; That's right!&nbsp; They won!&nbsp; That game had everyone in the park, even those who were there and not part of the games were sitting on the edge of their seats.&nbsp; The girls drew a huge crowd.&nbsp; 

There was a 10 minute break and then Jessica's team had to play against the first place team.&nbsp; The crowd continued to grow and ALL the stands were filled and all the spaces in between were filled with people sitting on the grass watching the game.&nbsp; What another great game!&nbsp; While it didn't go into extra innings, woah the girls really pulled it out.&nbsp; Jessica's team was getting stomped in the beginning but out of nowhere they pulled it together and managed to tie it up.&nbsp; We thought they would be going into extra innings but in the last inning, Jessie's team grabbed 4 extra runs and it was all over.&nbsp; 

A team that came into the Championships with only one win the entire season came away the Champions.&nbsp; It just goes to show that you should never give up and count yourself out because if you try your hardest, you can accomplish anything.

Unfortunately, because Jessica's games were first AND ran into so many extra innings, it caused all the other games for the rest of the day to be delayed so&nbsp; instead of ending at 4pm, we were there until 7pm. 

All in all, everyone had fun.&nbsp; We had two diamonds going, the main one for fast pitch and the small one for the t-ball players.&nbsp; During Championships, the diamonds get chalked, which the kids love.&nbsp; For the fast pitch, there are two umpires and for t-ball there is just one.&nbsp; In addition, for the Championships, the games are announced on a PA system so the kids really have fun with it.&nbsp; They created nicknames for themselves such as Trevor the Terminator.&nbsp; The announcers really made it fun for the kids, they were laughing, taking bows and so on.&nbsp; 

By the time the games ended, we had packed up and left (7pm) we were all exhausted and sunburned.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our day was not over.&nbsp; We had just enough time to go home, unpack, change and leave because it was Ryan's birthday and we were meeting the grandparents and aunt at the restaurant of Ryan's choosing for his birthday dinner.&nbsp; We could barely move but we made it to the restaurant, then back to the house to open presents and eat cake.&nbsp; Within 5 minutes of the grandparents and aunt leaving, the entire house was in bed and asleep as fast as our heads hit the pillows.&nbsp; WHEW!

While I would love to say that Sunday, we all got to stay home and relax but, alas, that isn't the case.&nbsp; All the women in the house had a baby shower to attend.&nbsp; We were still very exhausted from the night before, but we dragged ourselves to the baby shower of a family friend.

I'm only now just starting to feel like I am recovering from the event.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; Even my face is starting to recover as is evident from my nose which is now peeling."

"event","<img src=""http://www.rynet.com/lotd/images/phoebe.jpg"" align=""left"">We have finally received photos of Saturn's moon named Phoebe.&nbsp; Phoebe's estimated age is approximately 4.5 billion years and it is certainly showing its age as it is fairly beaten up.

Phoebe was visited Friday by the Cassini spacecraft. The successful flyby exposed the small world in amazing detail.&nbsp; This flyby is part of a 53 flyby mission of seven moons in the Saturnian system.

Scientists have suspected Phoebe is instead an object captured from the Kuiper Belt, a more distant region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. There were already clues: Phoebe is oddly dark for a moon and it orbits backward compared to the rotation of Saturn and the paths of the planet's larger moons.

Some of the bright areas on the small moon may be material from below -- possibly water ice -- that's been exposed by impacts.&nbsp; It is too early to tell."

"event","This weekend we headed up to the lake.&nbsp; All I can say is ""Wow!""&nbsp; What an amazing weekend.

Friday:&nbsp; Ryan, Dad and I head up to meet the delivery guy.&nbsp; He was bringing our new trailer, fresh from the factory.&nbsp; So we arrive about an hour before when the trailer was to arrive, only to see that there are tree's down on our property.&nbsp; Let me explain a little (for those who are too lazy to scroll back), on Easter, we received a message that a tree had fallen on our travel trailer.&nbsp; The tree totaled the trailer and we (mom and dad) were forced to buy a new one or stop going up north every weekend.&nbsp; They didn't want to give up their special weekends so they used the insurance money to make a hefty down payment on a new 2004 factory-made and customized 33ft. travel trailer.&nbsp; Due to the tree falling on our trailer, the manager of the community cut down a bunch of trees that were threatening to fall on other trailers.&nbsp; So we arrive and a bunch of trees had been cut down on the ones that were cut down in our area were strewn through our lot in pieces.&nbsp; We had no choice but to immediately move all of it before the guy bringing the trailer showed up.&nbsp; We no sooner finish and they guy shows up.

Within 30 minutes, our new trailer was positioned, anchors and jacks in place and we were taking a tour of our new weekend getaway.&nbsp; We noticed a few problems right away, there was improper stitching on the awning so we had to call to have it replaced, there were holes in the shower curtain, and there were not stoppers for the bathroom sink and shower/tub.&nbsp; Dad called the dealership and they said they would re-order the awning and they should be able to install it next week, as well as bring the stoppers and a new shower curtain.

Ryan, Dad and I spent the rest of the day (from 10am to 6pm) cleaning all the old stuff and bringing it back into the trailer.&nbsp; WOW, that was a long day.&nbsp; Then we waited while Mom, Amanda and Jessica showed up.&nbsp; Jessica ended up coming with Grannie, Papa and Aunt Barbara.&nbsp; A couple hours later (around 11:30pm) mom and Amanda showed up.&nbsp; Amanda had a softball game otherwise they would have arrived much sooner.&nbsp; We had a bunch of stuff loaded into the van so we brought in the essentials and then started settling down for the night.

Let me interject some fun things.&nbsp; Earlier in the day, I was sitting on the deck and Ryan and I saw several silk worms.&nbsp; This was the first time I had ever seen silk worms.&nbsp; They look like catapillers.&nbsp; They hand down from a silk stand (web like thing) then crawl back up their silk while wadding it into a ball.&nbsp; It was actually really fun to watch.&nbsp; Then a little later, an adorable chipmunk came right up to me looking for some peanuts; unfortunately, I didn't have any.&nbsp; He was so adorable.&nbsp; I had never seen a chipmunk before either.

Just before heading to bed, we (Amanda, Ryan and I) were walking to the restrooms when Ryan told us to look up.&nbsp; There were soooo many stars out and for the first time (yes a lot of firsts this weekend), I was able to see the Milky Way.&nbsp; Later in the summer, Ryan says I should be able to see the Northern Lights.

Saturday:&nbsp; Bright and early at 8:30am, I woke to hear mom re-arranging the dishes.&nbsp; Dad and I put them in the wrong spot.&nbsp; Figures!&nbsp; She was making quite a racket but somehow I managed to get another hour's sleep (being awakened by a lot of noise off and on) before dad finally told us to get our bums out of bed to eat breakfast.&nbsp; 

After a hearty breakfast of bacon, eggs, toast and soda bread, dad, Ryan and a bunch of guys from the community helped us move our deck over and re level it.&nbsp; The new trailer is a little larger and has it's awning poles in a different location so we had to move the deck so that when the awning is replaced, we can put up the add-a-room.

After the deck was moved, Amanda, Ryan and I headed into town to buy me a swimsuit.&nbsp; Talk about stress!&nbsp; I hate swimsuits, they show off every single flaw that we have.&nbsp; Ryan wanted me to get a 2-piece, I wanted a one piece.&nbsp; After much debate, I got a 2-piece to make my husband happy.&nbsp; I just wish it wasn't so um.... small.

We got back to the trailer, changed into our suits and spent several fun hours in the lake.&nbsp; We had planned to take out the boat to the middle of the lake to swim but after about 45 minutes, we had to accept that the boat wasn't going to start. *pooh*&nbsp; So we headed to the beach instead.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the water is still pretty cold so by the time we were finished, I was freezing.&nbsp; I must have reduced my core temperature because I was cold for many hours afterwards but it was worth it.&nbsp; We had such a great time.&nbsp; Even Jessica was having fun in the water with us.&nbsp; I don't think I've seen her laugh so much in an entire week let alone a few hours!

After the swim, we headed to town for dinner, then came back to start a campfire.&nbsp; Apparently, our campfires are ""the"" hangout spot.&nbsp; One-by-one and two-by-two, people would show up with beer, snacks and chairs in their hands and the circle around the fire grew bigger and bigger.&nbsp; We sat around the fire with the neighbors for hours until it was time to head to bed.&nbsp; Amanda, Ryan and I stayed up to play some cards (I swear Ryan cheats) before we also turned in.

Sunday:&nbsp; What a sad morning.&nbsp; We were all disappointed that the weekend was coming to a close.&nbsp; Further, our perfect weekend weather had turned dark as the skies opening up to rain down upon us.&nbsp; Apparently, Mother Nature was sad as well.&nbsp; After a fantastic breakfast of French toast, dad got a tow for the boat from a neighbor to take the boat to the shop to get checked out and we sat around playing cards for a little bit before giving up and packing to come home.&nbsp; Amanda, Ryan and I left around lunch time, stopped at the dairy on the way home (a tradition) before making it home.&nbsp; I headed straight up to bed to catch a nap, I was so tired.

All in all, it was an amazing weekend that I didn't want to end.&nbsp; I can't wait until next weekend."

"event","The family just arrived home from their vacation to Myrtle Beach.&nbsp; They came home a day early due to a motorcycle convention which made it impossible for them to sleep.&nbsp; They arrived tan and cold; they got too used to the warm temperatures at the beach.

The girls made stuffed animals at a factory, visited an aquarium and many more things that took up their time.&nbsp; They had a fabulous vacation.&nbsp; They even came home bearing gifts.&nbsp; I received two t-shirts, a shell (from Jessica), and a carton of American cigarettes (they are cheaper in the states and taste better, lol).&nbsp; Ryan got a shot glass, two t-shirts, a shell and a pair of tear-away pants.

One of the first announcements they made upon arriving home was a good one.&nbsp; It appears that the maid threw away Jessica's blankie while cleaning the room one day.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; This ""blankie"" as she calls it was really just a small scrap of what was once a blanket.&nbsp; It was about 4 inches long and maybe half an inch wide and was knotted up to hold it together.&nbsp; The thing was rank and disgusting.&nbsp; We've been trying to convince her to get rid of it; she's twelve and doesn't need a security blanket anymore.&nbsp; One item down, two more to go.&nbsp; Now if we can get her to stop sucking her finger, and stop carrying around ""Blue Bunny"" all will be well.

Unfortunately, we were unable to kill the fish, as per mom's ""suggestion"".&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; She said ""I wouldn't be sad if the fish was to possibly die while we are gone.""&nbsp; and then added, ""Be sure to throw it away, tank and all, into the trash.""&nbsp; Sadly, the fish lived.&nbsp; It is a hearty little fish.&nbsp; Plus, when grandma came over each morning to feed the dog and cat, she also fed the fish.

On a separate note, springtime in Toronto is quite lovely.&nbsp; There are so many beautiful flowers popping up in everyone's yards and dandelions growing wild in everyone's grass.&nbsp; We have a gorgeous white flowered tree in the complex that makes me smile every time I see it.&nbsp; Grandma's cherry blossom is looking gorgeous along with all her other plants that I have no idea what they are because we didn't have them in Phoenix.&nbsp; I wouldn't want to be anywhere else, I love it here in Toronto and I love being with my husband."

"event","Easter was a fantastic family day.&nbsp; We woke in the morning to find Easter baskets full of treats for us to enjoy.&nbsp; We also got one big present each.&nbsp; Ryan and Amanda got new shoes.&nbsp; Jessica received a new bedding set that she's been wanting and I got a new outfit (jeans, which I haven't owned any in over 8 years and a t-shirt that I will wear once it warms up).&nbsp; The ""Easter Bunny"" left clues for Amanda (19) and Jessica (12) to find their Easter treats.&nbsp; That was pretty cute, actually.&nbsp; I think that is a tradition that Ryan and I will keep going when we have children.

After all the treats were found and our new items modeled, ohh'd and ahh'd over, my father-in-law made us a nice Easter breakfast.&nbsp; Then we hung out at home until 3pm when we headed to the grandparents.&nbsp; We enjoyed a nice game of Ramoley (sp?) and had a lovely Easter turkey dinner.

Unfortunately, not long after dinner as we were preparing to go home, my father-in-law received a bad telephone call.&nbsp; It appears that a tree has fallen onto our trailer up in Haliburton and it needs to be looked at as quickly as possible. Dad stressed about it all night and him and mom headed up to check it out first thing this morning.

While I was sleeeping (Ryan kept me up all night the eve of Easter), I heard a knock at the door and the dog barking like she was on fire.&nbsp; Let me preface this by saying that my depth perception really sucks ever since I cut my eye open with a rock when I was 13.&nbsp; So I rush to answer the door, afraid of missing a possible package.&nbsp; I am really bad about sleeping through deliveries.&nbsp; Anyway, I was rushing to answer the door and misjudged the very first step on the stairs and fell all the way down them.&nbsp; I hurt pretty much everything on the way down but the biggest thing I hurt (no pun intended) was my bum.&nbsp; Go ahead and laugh but my left cheek is swollen from a HUGE lump and rug burn.&nbsp; It took like an hour before I could even attempt to sit down and even then I was in a lot of pain.&nbsp; I'm walking a bit better now and I can even sit (albiet with a lot of pain).&nbsp; It is getting better as time moves along but oy!&nbsp; the pain is terrible.&nbsp; If it had happened to anyone else, I probably would have laughed but after having to deal with it myself, well... I doubt I'll laugh in the future because I KNOW how much it hurts.

See, with my depth perception problem, I have a hard time with stairs.&nbsp; It was never a big deal because I always lived in a single story home but now I live in a townhouse with two floors and a basement.&nbsp; I'm constantly misjudging the stairs but usually it is the last couple steps going down or the first couple steps going up.&nbsp; This is the first time I've fallen from top to bottom and hopefully the last.

I was really lucky because I was trying to find Ryan's pager number to let him know what happened and all of a sudden he calls.  We were apparently on the same wavelength but then we already knew that; we are soulmates.  So he rushed home from work (seriously, I was in a lot of pain) and took care of me.  I love him so much.  


To sum everything up:

Easter was great

The tree that cut through the trailer really sucks

My bum really freaking hurts.

Easter, trees and bums.&nbsp; Oh my!"

"event","In an article on MSNBC, a Canadian judge ruled that peer-to-peer file swapping/sharing is legal in Canada and does not infringe upon copyrights.&nbsp; Here is the article.&nbsp; This is excellent news for Canadians who wish to download MP3's.&nbsp; The following is excerpts from the article...

<blockquote>Sharing copyrighted works on peer-to-peer networks is legal in Canada, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday, handing the record industry a sharp setback in its international fight against file swappers. </blockquote>
<blockquote>In a far-ranging decision, the court further found that both downloading music and putting it in a shared folder available to other people online appeared to be legal in Canada</blockquote><blockquote>Canada's debate over file-swapping flared last December, when the country's Copyright Board, which regulates intellectual property issues, ruled that downloading songs from a peer-to-peer network for personal use -- but not necessarily uploading -- appeared to be legal.

The regulators cited a long-standing rule in Canada, in which most copying for personal use was allowed. To repay artists and record labels for revenues lost by this activity, the government imposes a fee on blank tapes, CDs and even hard-disk-based MP3 players such as Apple's iPod, and distributes those revenues to copyright holders.</blockquote><blockquote>With respect to downloading, the judge accepted the Copyright Board's early decision almost without comment. But he went further, citing a recent Supreme Court decision to say that making music available online also appeared to be legal. 

In that recent case, the Supreme Court ruled that libraries were not ""authorizing"" copyright infringement simply by putting photocopy machines near books. The libraries were justified in assuming that their customers were using the copiers in a legal manner, the high court ruled. 

Finckenstein said the same rationale should apply to peer-to-peer users. 

""The mere fact of placing a copy on a shared directory in a computer where that copy can be accessed via a P2P service does not amount to distribution,"" Judge Konrad von Finckenstein wrote. ""Before it constitutes distribution, there must be a positive act by the owner of the shared directory, such as sending out the copies or advertising that they are available for copying."" 

Ottawa's Geist said this appeared to make uploading itself legal as well, since a peer-to-peer user -- like a library -- would be entitled to assume that the person on the other side of the connection was acting legally, since downloading was also legal in Canada.</blockquote>"

"event","Well, not officially but they are coming Tuesday after they get off work to pick it up.&nbsp; My car, a 1998 Mazda Protege LX, had to be sold because we can't bring it to Canada.&nbsp; We can't afford the payments.&nbsp; Technically, the car is paid off at least to the bank but my mom, as an incentive to get me to move back to Arizona from Kansas, paid off the car and put the remaining 13 months of car payments onto her credit card.&nbsp; Mainly, she got pissed at my bank because they weren't honoring the financial power of attorney that I gave her so to solve the problem, she paid the car off.&nbsp; Anyway, I've been paying the payments to my mother instead of to the bank.&nbsp; However, the payments are higher to us because we have to convert Canadian dollars to American dollars.&nbsp; So a $220/mo payment is almost $300 Canadian each month.&nbsp; Ryan and I can't afford that right now so we had to sell the car.

The lady who is buying the car fell in love with my car instantly.&nbsp; She wanted to buy it today but the banks are closed and they are unable to get a cashier's check today so they are coming back on Tuesday to get it.&nbsp; They even asked if they can keep the cowboy hat that hangs from my rear view mirror.&nbsp; (It was an old air freshener that I bought when my car was 2 days old.&nbsp; I wasn't able to find another one like it so I kept the little hat in my car because it matched the interior and it was cute)&nbsp; Anyway, we are really happy about selling my car and we got what I asked for.&nbsp; I will still owe my mom a little bit of money because she didn't just close my car loan account but my credit card as well, however, the amount is nominal and once I get my residency here in Canada and start working, I'll be able to pay that off in no time at all.&nbsp; It's only like $1500 USD that I will still owe her.&nbsp; No biggie.

Anyway, I'm happy and sad about the sale of the car.&nbsp; Happy that we won't have to keep paying on it but sad that I am losing the only thing I owned that was worth anything. I bought the car with only 11 miles on it.&nbsp; It was brand new and it was a great car that never gave me a lick of trouble.&nbsp; It served me well and I will miss it.&nbsp; Heck, I've missed having my car since I came to Canada.&nbsp; I miss being able to just hop in my car and go where I want, when I want.&nbsp; I can't do that here.&nbsp; I can't drive any of the family cars because I'm not on the insurance and I don't have a Canadian license so I can't get on the insurance, plus, I doubt we can afford to put me on the policy.&nbsp; We pay something like $2200 a year for Ryan to be on the policy and that kills us enough.

Someday, I will get another car and everything will be fine but for now, I am stuck without a car.&nbsp; I have a feeling that when the time comes, I will have to learn the public transit system here."

"event","Tonight was a total family night.&nbsp; It started at dinner time.&nbsp; We all (except Ryan and his father who were working) headed to Kelsie's for dinner.&nbsp; On the way home we picked up two movies... Spy Kids 3-D (for Jessie) and Cold Creek Manor (for my mother-in-law).&nbsp; We watched Spy Kids first.&nbsp; 

3-D movies suck.&nbsp; Let me just say that one more time.&nbsp; 3-D movies suck.&nbsp; Halfway through the movie, I got a splitting headache from the 3-D glasses.&nbsp; By the time the movie was done, my vision was totally messed up, my head hurt bad and to make things worse, the movie sucked.&nbsp; LOL.

Shortly after Spy Kids ended, Ryan and Charlie came home from work.&nbsp; We watched an episode of Outer Limits before starting the next movie, Cold Creek Manor.&nbsp; Ok, admittedly, the movie sucked.&nbsp; Ryan and Charlie, however, insisted on razzing Helen (my mother-in-law) repeatedly for choosing the movie.&nbsp; 

So here's a little about Cold Creek Manor.&nbsp; It stars Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone.&nbsp; Trying to escape the dangers of living in New York City, the couple and their two kids buy a farmhouse manor in a small town.&nbsp; They got a great deal on the dilapidated home and all its contents inside.&nbsp; They discover that their dream home is more of a nightmare when the previous owner (Stephen Dorff) has recently been let out of prison and comes home only to find that it had been sold by the bank (they repossessed the home).&nbsp; The previous owner decides he wants the house back along with all its secrets.

Ok, at first glance, it sounds like it could be a good movie and the trailers certainly make it out to be a scary movie.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the story has no depth.&nbsp; For example, there is a scene where the wife (Stone) is propositioned by her boss.&nbsp; He basically says, have an affair with me and I'll make you Vice President of the company.&nbsp; The scene fades, the son nearly gets hit by a car and then they move to the small town.&nbsp; The near affair is only mentioned one other time.&nbsp; So what was the point of even putting it into the movie?&nbsp; Where was the rest of it?&nbsp; Either finish the thought or don't put it in the movie at all.

The town slut (Juliette Lewis), what was her role other than the girlfriend of the ex-con previous owner?&nbsp; Her sister was the town sheriff but she really didn't do much in the movie.&nbsp; The ex-con's father, what role did he really play?&nbsp; None that I could see.&nbsp; In fact, the only character who had any type of depth in the movie was the murdering ex-con/previous owner and even that was pretty minimal.&nbsp; I mean seriously.&nbsp; The dude gets out of jail, shows up at the house (inside the house rifling through a bunch of stuff), invites himself to dinner then lights up a joint as soon as he finishes eating and says ""Can I ask a favor?&nbsp; I just got out of jail, I used to own this house and I need a job.&nbsp; Can I help you renovate the house?""&nbsp; I mean seriously!&nbsp; Would YOU let that person work on the property?&nbsp; The entire movie wasn't realistic, very cliche and plain boring.

Honestly, with a cast of Dennis Quaid, Sharon Stone and Juliette Lewis, I would have expected more.&nbsp; They are movie veterans.&nbsp; Couldn't they tell a bad script when they read it?&nbsp; All I can say is avoid watching this movie.&nbsp; Save the rental fees and get something worth watching.

In fact, the other day, Ryan and I rented some movies.&nbsp; Under the Tuscan Sun was pretty good.&nbsp; Ryan and I both enjoyed it.&nbsp; Ryan talked bad about the movie for months but he finally let me rent it and he ended up liking it.&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; Something's Got To Give was a great movie and I'm not really a fan of Jack Nickelson or Diane Keaton.&nbsp; We also saw School of Rock but I don't recommend it.&nbsp; It stars Jack Black (I believe), whom I'm not a fan of but Ryan wanted to see the movie.&nbsp; At the end of the movie, (the same night we watched Under the Tuscan Sun), Ryan said that Under the Tuscan Sun was far better.&nbsp; 

On Monday, we are going to rent some more movies because Ryan has the day off.&nbsp; I know it's rare right now but he actually has a day off so we are going to relax and watch some movies and spend the day together.&nbsp; Anyway, we plan to rent The Matrix Revolutions and something else but we haven't decided on that yet.&nbsp; I haven't heard too many good reviews about it but after seeing the first two, I have to see how it ends.&nbsp; 

That's all for tonight everyone, have a good weekend and don't forget to move your clocks an hour ahead for Daylight Savings."

"event","The other day, Ryan and I had a fabulous day together.&nbsp; Ryan worked in the morning for a couple hours but was home within an hour of me waking up.&nbsp; We dedicated the entire day to spending time together; just us.&nbsp; We hung out in our basement living room for a while, then headed upstairs to watch last week's episode of Average Joe: Adam Returns.&nbsp; We ordered a pizza for lunch, then had some special private time that I'm not going to talk about in a journal.&nbsp; An hour after that, we decided to take a nap.&nbsp; We took a four-hour nap wrapped in each others arms.&nbsp; 

When we woke from our nap it was pretty late, so we headed out and got dinner and picked up some rental movies.&nbsp; We ate dinner, then watched movies cuddled up in one another's arms until 4am.&nbsp; We even came up with plans to further enhance our basement living room.&nbsp; We are going to buy a sheet and some rolled batting and I'm going to fold the sheet in half, fill it with batting and make a little cushion for the floor so that when we watch movies, our bums don't get numb. 

Overall, while it was an inexpensive night spent mostly at home, we had the best time.&nbsp; It was absolutely perfect and best of all, we got some much needed quality time together.&nbsp; Lately, it has felt as though we were sharing our time with the family.&nbsp; Whether it was Ryan, Jessie and I heading out to go Geocaching, or spending time with the grandparents, or the family, it felt as though we had no time for just us.&nbsp; So we dedicated that day together and it was heaven.

I love being with my husband and I can't wait until we can do this again."

"event","Today, Ryan, Jessica (Ryan's youngest sister) and I went <a href=""http://www.geocaching.com"">Geocaching</a>.&nbsp; For those who have never heard of it, Geocaching is basically hiding special items in locations for other Geocacher's to find, then they take them and put them in another Geocaching site somewhere else.&nbsp; Each cache has a story behind it.&nbsp; Some caches are meant to travel the world, some to travel to specific locations, some are just virtual caches which you just find landmarks and answer the questions and learn a little about the location.

Today we went to a park here in Toronto, with our caching items in hand, we used the GPS system to get us to the location of the caches.&nbsp; Then we hunted around FOREVER trying to actually FIND the cache, even decoded the clues for better luck in finding them.&nbsp; The first location was hidden in the trunk of a live tree.&nbsp; The trunk had a whole in it and the waterproof box was way up inside the the trunk of the tree.&nbsp; This was the first location and the one we spent the most time on because we had never done it before and so we had no clue where to start looking.&nbsp; We succeeded though and had a great time.&nbsp; We were exhausted by the end of the first but after finding it, we caught a second wind and headed on to the second.

The second was a virtual cache.&nbsp; We pretty much figured out where it was but the GPS kept saying that while we were moving in the right direction, we were getting further and further from it.&nbsp; After walking what had to be several miles, we finally gave up and decided that the virtual wouldn't be nearly as fun.

The third and final cache was difficult.&nbsp; While the clues pretty much led us right to it (since the GPS was being stupid due to all the trees in the park) but the hard part was actually getting to it.&nbsp; The cache was hidden on the side of a somewhat steep and VERY slippery hill.&nbsp; The last cache had been there for several years and had TONS and TONS of visitors.&nbsp; Looking through the log book that you sign when you visit every cache, it appears that everyone loved the challenge of finding the location and had a grand time with it.&nbsp; For the final one, we actually accidentally left our cache items in the car (only on this last one) so we just looked but took nothing and left nothing.

Overall, the experience was amazing.&nbsp; We had a grand time and spent some quality time with Jessica.&nbsp; She loved it and can't wait for our next Geocaching trip.&nbsp; Now that Sully the Bear (Jessie's first Geocaching item) has been placed, she is eager to see it's progress as it travels throughout Canada.&nbsp; Sully is a Canada Mini-beanie baby bear.&nbsp; Sully has two siblings, an American beanie bear that hopes to travel throughout the United States in as many places as possible before returning home to Canada.&nbsp; Pineapple Bear, World Explorer is a beanie with a pineapple costume on that hopes to travel all over the world before returning to Toronto.&nbsp; What a great family thing to do!"

"event","I know; I know, I have posted a lot today.&nbsp; Quite a change from the normal but apparently I've had a lot to say today.&nbsp; 

This most recent installment is about the great love in my life... my husband.&nbsp; I simply have the best and most amazing husband in the universe.&nbsp; Let me just give you a couple examples of how amazing he is. 

Last night, my husband, Ryan, was playing an online game called Planetside.&nbsp; Ryan is the Project Manager/Senior Editor of <a href=""http://planetside.stratics.com/"">Planetside Stratics</a>.&nbsp; To be a good PM, he needs to know and understand the game, so he plays when he has the time.&nbsp; Last night, he was playing and in the middle of an intense battle, with bullets rushing at him from all angles, I got up and gave him a kiss on the cheek.&nbsp; I didn't want to disturb him but wanted to show him a little love to let him know I was thinking of him.&nbsp; You won't believe what he did next... he stopped, turned toward me and gave me a long, passionate kiss.&nbsp; Yep, that's right.&nbsp; My husband stopped what he was doing and gave me enormous amounts of love, right there and then.&nbsp; He could have kept on playing, it wouldn't have bothered me.&nbsp; He didn't even have to acknowledge the kiss that I gave him but he did.&nbsp; He stopped it all and gave me all his attention.&nbsp; To anyone who is not a gamer or doesn't know a gamer wouldn't understand the importance of this gesture but for those who do, they understand.

Later on, we finally went to bed.&nbsp; It was 5am, we were both dead tired.&nbsp; In fact, he played until that time and I crashed out on the couch near him.&nbsp; We have this little rule that we don't go upstairs to bed without the other, so if one person wants to sleep, they sleep on the couch until the other is ready to go to bed.&nbsp; It's our way of always being near one another.&nbsp; Anyway, so here we are in bed ready to pass out, I'm getting settled in, snuggling up to Ryan and all of a sudden he steals some of the covers.&nbsp; We call that pre-stealing.&nbsp; You see, every night I fight my husband for the covers because he is always stealing them while we sleep.&nbsp; So he pre-stole about 4 inches or so of covers.&nbsp; Woah!&nbsp; Them's fighting words!&nbsp; HAHA.&nbsp; So I did what any normal, freezing wife would do.... I stole ALL the covers.&nbsp; Yes, all of them; top sheet and both comforters.&nbsp; So we playfully wrestled with the covers for about 30 minutes, then I decided to take not only all the covers but all the pillows too.&nbsp; (We have two pillows each)&nbsp; HAHA.&nbsp; His face was classic.&nbsp; He was in shock because I'd never done that before.&nbsp; Then somehow I managed to slowly push him OFF the bed.&nbsp; HAHA.&nbsp; He retaliated by stealing my side of the bed but finally begged me to let him have his side back because it has the appropriate ""dip"".&nbsp; HAHA.&nbsp; Eventually, I gave in and remade the bed&nbsp; (since the covers were all bunched up) and then we settled down but we had a grand time for about an hour.&nbsp; 

Ryan and I have such a great time together, filled with lots of love, respect and fun.&nbsp; Ryan appreciates everything that I do, whether it is making the bed each day, doing the laundry, washing dishes or whatever.&nbsp; He lets me know every time I do something how much he appreciates it.&nbsp; He doesn't care whether I am perfect or not, he overlooks any imperfections within me.&nbsp; All he cares about is whether I love him or not.&nbsp; Not only do I love him, but I love him with every ounce of energy pulsing within my body and show him every moment.&nbsp; We have the most amazing relationship and I'm thankful every day for having him in my life.

FAE+1BY+1D, Ryan!&nbsp; I love you!"

"event","So what is it?&nbsp; In one of the most remarkable astronomical discoveries, a round mass, approximately 800 to 1,100 miles in diameter was discovered beyond Pluto.&nbsp; Scientists are conflicted about how to classify this mass.&nbsp; Is it a small planet?&nbsp; a planetoid?&nbsp; or is it simply a large and spectacular comet?&nbsp; The mass has been tentatively named Sedna, after the goddess in Inuit mythology who created sea creatures.

What I find to be funny is that scientists are slightly closed minded.&nbsp; It was only in 1930 that Pluto was discovered in the outer edges of our solar system and apparently there are still some scientists who don't believe that Pluto is actually a planet.&nbsp; While I am no scientist, I had always assumed that the vast majority of scientists have agreed to classify it as a planet.&nbsp; However, why is it that so many scientists aren't willing to accept the concept that there very well could be more planets out there in our solar system and we just lack the technology to see them.&nbsp; 

The question comes into play of whether or not scientists believe that we are the only planetary solar system in the universe. Think about this... how big is the universe?&nbsp; We don't know the answer to that question but have you ever tried to picture the end of the universe?&nbsp; Is there some wall where the universe simply ends?&nbsp; If so then wouldn't there be something behind the wall?&nbsp; Or what if the universe was round, like planets?&nbsp; Wouldn't there have to be an outer atmosphere if it was round?&nbsp; Wouldn't there be something above and below it?&nbsp; No matter how you try to picture it, there isn't an answer because no matter the answer, there's always an argument that could refute it to simply say, there is something beyond.&nbsp; 

Using the idea that the universe is an endless area, wouldn't it be possible that there are trillions of objects such as, comets, asteroids, stars, suns, moons, and, yes, planets that we have yet to discover?&nbsp; Just because we cannot ""see"" that far with our limited technology doesn't mean they don't exist.&nbsp; Who are we to say what is or is not a planet?&nbsp; I've never heard of a comet or asteroid that was perfectly round in shape, similar to a planet.&nbsp; 

Some scientists theorize that Sedna is a young planet, a small planet in the early stages of its existence.&nbsp; Other scientists have similar theories but feel that this young planet was knocked off course tossing it into the outer edges and because it was pushed so far out, the growth of this possible young planet was thwarted and it simply stopped evolving.

In continuing to read the article, it states that they believe that this ""mass"" has a moon circling it.&nbsp; So Sedna has a moon but is not a planet?&nbsp; What I also find to be interesting in the article is that the ""mass"" appears to be very red, nearly as red as Mars, which has the scientists baffled.&nbsp; All outer planets grow lighter in color, often white due to severe icing caused by its distance from the sun.&nbsp; Why then, is Sedna red?

The Hubble telescope is on the task.&nbsp; Scientists hope to learn more in a few days about Sedna but doubt that they will really learn that much.&nbsp; It is felt that New Horizons will give the true answers.&nbsp; 

New Horizons is the first exploration of the third zone of the solar system, it is a space probe, of sorts, that will be launched in 2006 on a mission to Pluto.&nbsp; It's purpose is to learn more about Pluto, a planet in controversy, get a good picture of Pluto and learn what lies beyond our visual scope of the solar system.&nbsp; New Horizons is expected to reach its destination by the year 2015.&nbsp; While the purpose of the probe was originally to learn more about Pluto and make a determination, once and for all, about whether it is a planet or an interstellar common object, it's purpose was also to learn what lies beyond.&nbsp; 

Pluto has a moon, which would lead credancy to the theory that it is, in fact, a planet, just as Sedna is believed to have a moon in its orbit.&nbsp; The difficulty lies in the fact that there is no specific definition of what makes a planet.&nbsp; Without a true definition, it cannot be disproved, nor proved.&nbsp; New Horizons hopes to educate us and through its discoveries, we may find that Sedna is, indeed, a planet and who knows, maybe find additional planets, or we may end up losing a planet if it is discovered that Pluto is <i>not</i> a planet after all.&nbsp; Only time and technology will tell.&nbsp; It does provoke some hard thoughts."

"event","Over the weekend we watched a few movies.&nbsp; I'm not going to tell you about the movies, the plots and such.&nbsp; I'm just giving my opinions on them.&nbsp; I don't want to ruin them for anyone if they hadn't seen it.&nbsp; What I have done instead is posted the descriptions from Yahoo

The first was Mona Lisa's Smile.&nbsp; This movie wasn't bad.&nbsp; I have to say I enjoyed it;&nbsp; however, it is not something I would want to watch again for a while.&nbsp; It is one of those movies that I'd watch maybe once a year or so.&nbsp; I liked the cast line up:&nbsp; Julia Roberts, Julia Stiles and Kirsten Dunst.&nbsp; I heard a lot of mixed reviews from people on this movie and I have to say, you either like it or hate it.&nbsp; Ryan didn't like it but Amanda, my mother-in-law and I did.

Yahoo Movie Description: 1953 America was a time ripe for change for women and when Katherine Ann Willis (Julia Roberts) arrives to teach Art History at Wellesley College, she finds the institution drowning in outdated mores. While the nation struggles with the fears that accompany a shifting political culture, the powers that be at Wellesley seem to want to re-corset the women who had been the backbone of the World War II workforce just a few years earlier. A passionate educator, Katherine takes on the establishment and in doing so, deeply affects her students who in turn lead her to alter the course of her life forever. 

The other movie we rented was an awesome one; Radio.&nbsp; Talk about an amazing movie.&nbsp; If you haven't seen this movie, rent it because it is great.&nbsp; This is a true story type movie.&nbsp; When I was in Arizona, we went for years without television and didn't get our television back until a few days before Ryan and I were married so I had no clue that this movie was even out.&nbsp; Over Christmas, I remembered seeing a preview for it at the theater that said it was coming out on video soon.&nbsp; Ryan and I both looked at each other and said that we both wanted to see it.&nbsp; Seriously, if you see this movie in the video store, you should rent it.

Yahoo Movie Description: Radio tells the story of Football coach Harold Jones (Ed Harris),who befriends mentally challenged student Radio (Gooding), at T. L. Hanna High School in Anderson, South Carolina. Initially, Radio is shy and tormented by the students and townspeople, but as his friendship with Jones extends over several decades, he finds the strength within to changes perceptions and challenge prejudices, eventually transforming the entire community."

"event","Bleh, don't you just hate migraines?  I've been plagued with them lately and it is driving me nuts.  I'm beginning to wonder if there is something in the air in the basement that is causing them.  Ryan thought they might be caused by having the lights out and using the computers with the lights off but I was off the computer all day and had the lights on and I still got a whopper of a migraine.  Luckily, I took a long nap and was able to get rid of most of it.  (btw, we have the lights out because my monitor is really old and dying and I can't see the screen without the lights off when I play Everquest)

So I'm back to my thoughts that there is something in the air; some smell or chemical that is causing them.  It's not like I am stressing about anything.  I have nothing to stress about; my life is fabulous.  Bleh, I wish they'd just go away and leave me alone!"

"event","People are funny things.  They talk in double-talk.  They say one thing and mean another.  Why can't people just say what they want to say and leave it at that?

I've been told that I live in the past.  I've come to realize that most people do.  People make judgments on things that have happened to you, to them, and to others in the past and they relive them every time an argument ensues.  Case in point, a ""discussion"" happened tonight and a lot of things were brought up from the past that had little or no bearing on the ""discussion"" at hand.  This isn't the first time something like this has happened.  Thinking back onto discussions that I've had with people throughout my life, I realize that everyone lives in the past; or at least brings the past to the present whenever it suits them.  Such is the way with humans and their thought processes."

"event","Ryan, the family and I went to the trailer show here in Toronto.  I thought it would be pretty lame but I actually had a lot of fun.  They had all kinds of trailers from buses to RV's to pop-up trailers.  Ryan and I found a nice little pop-up trailer that would be perfect for up north.  We want to get something simple and not expensive but would afford us some privacy when we go up north each weekend in the summer.  

Ryan's family has a place up in cottage country right on the lake that they have some travel trailers on.  They go up every weekend starting in late spring and on through till October.  His parents travel trailer is small though and won't easily accommodate another person but for this year, that is what it will have to do.  The pop-up that Ryan and I want to get is $8500 Canadian and we can't afford it this year but next year we are planning to get it.  It will actually sleep about 6 people or so, even though it will only be used for us.  It has a sink, stove, heater, etc. It is actually quite nice and fairly roomy.  The reason we like the pop-up so much is because it will easily attach to one of our vehicles and we can take it anywhere.  We hope to be able to travel a bit, now and then, and this would be perfect for that and still be able to accommodate us when we decide to have children.

Grandma, Papa and Aunt Barbara bought a new travel trailer.  It's very, very nice.  They won't get it until the boat is paid off in July but it will be a great place to hang out when the weather turns bad.  I suspect most of our time will be spent outside when the weather is good.  It has a lot of room as it extends  out on the sides when parked.  Plenty of room for 9 people to hang out in but not much room to spare. 

All-in-all, while an exhausting day, it was a lot of fun.  Ryan and I got to dream a little and the grandparents were able to purchase a new trailer for up north."

"event","When people get married, they inherit traditions for each side of the family.  For some, it's simply holiday traditions.  For other families, it is a slew of traditions that can rattle your brains.

When I married my husband, I married into a family with so many traditions they could fill an epic novel.  Not only are there numerous holiday traditions, but there are other traditions that tend to pop up from time to time.  There is the tradition of ""no chores"" ,so to speak, on each person's birthdays.  There is the tradition of eating in certain locations on specific days, i.e. Wednesdays is mall eating day, every other Sunday is dinner at the grandparents, once a month the family comes here to eat, etc.  Then there is the latest tradition that I was just apprised of.  This is the tradition of making Oscar picks and betting on them.  

I don't know about you, but I do NOT like betting.  I don't even enjoy going to casinos.  This family bets on everything.  Money exchanges faster in this household than in the NYSE.  So, anyway, my mother-in-law informed me moments ago that betting on the Oscars is mandatory.  Now, let me give a little back information.  When I lived in Arizona, we had no television reception for 2 years.  I never knew what movies were happening because attending movies at theaters is too hard on my knees.  I rarely rented movies because I rarely could afford it.  In all essence, I didn't watch anything.  I simply played on my computer and that was it.  So, back to today, having seen only a handful of movies since moving to Canada, I simply don't know who is up for what awards and what 90% of the movies listed even are about.  

Ahhh, traditions.  Every family has them. Some more than others.  Gotta love them anyway. :P"

Tonight, Ryan and I went with the entire family (grandma, papa, Aunt Barbara, the works) out to dinner at a nearby restaurant that the family loves.  The hostess, is a family friend.  Well, tonight, she asked me if I was pregnant.  I about died!  I'm not pregnant so naturally, I freaked out.  I said no, I'm just fat.  In all reality, I'm not fat.  I weigh only 126 pounds and I stand 5'4"" so I am perfectly proportioned but I am very sensitive about my weight.  You see, when I moved to Canada to be with my husband, it was the holiday season and we ate out and large meals a LOT.  What happened was that I gained a good 15 pounds.  I lost 5 pounds so far but I still feel like I am weighing more than I should.  So what does any red-blooded female do when asked if they are pregnant when they aren't?  I ran to the bathroom and cried like a baby.  So there you have it!  My night in a nutshell.  Great day, eh?"

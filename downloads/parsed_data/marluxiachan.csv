"event","Soon after coming to the club, Reno had ran off for a couple of minus coming back with a rather large grin on his face ""come on Sephiroth, like I told you 
. You will have fun, and don't worry nothing bad will happen."" Grinning still, Reno moved onto the generals lap, placing a tab in his mouth, soon after pressing a kiss to the others lips, pushing the tablet into. The others mouth. Of course he knew that in the morning he'd get punched for this, but in the end it would be worth it.



And, as the effects started in on the red head, Reno started to dance rather close to the other, grinding against him, and pressing kisses to the general when he could. But, before it really kicked in, sephiroth was dragged to a corner were no one was around, bottle of champagne in Reno's hand, kisses being pressed to the generals lips.

~song lyric~

hips ground against the others, as his arms wrapped around sephiroths shoulders, playing with his hair as moans of delight fell from his mouth. Champagne bottle was opened and poured over the both of them. Soon after, one of his hands moving into the others shirt, playing with a nipple. Loud music in the background vibrating in his head with each beat. ""I love you so much"" whispered in the generals ear, fingers tangling in the generals hair."

"event","Well. How should I start this? Buy calling my ex a stupid bint that did nothing all day? Or, explaining whats happend? Well, seeing as I&#39;ve already done one, lets do the other.



Well, I started dating my best friend back in... I&#39;d have to say that it was december she asked me out, while on the other side of the country. I was estatic. I mean I&#39;ve loved her sine I met her... It was awesome, adn nice to be in a relationship.

Went well until we moved int together. hahah. Let me tell you, that was the WORST fucking idea I&#39;ve ever had. Yeaaaaaaaah.

But, yeah, I lived with her for three months. It was all fine and dandy till I got my wisdom teeth out. Three in one day. I told her that the whole time I wanted to spend time with her. That fucking didn&#39;t happen. Not at all, I worked the day I got my teeth out (I didn&#39;t mind at all, they had me in the back the whole time so I wasn&#39;t talking) But, then I get a text from her asking if she can have a friend over. Alright, I didn&#39;t care either. It was fine until I wanted to go to bed. Lets say this before I o farther. When I&#39;m in pain, I&#39;m a bitch. Like, I will kill you if you look at me the wrong way.

Her and her fucking friend (which I think she was cheating on me with) They were up all fucking night giggling and that shit, and this happend for THREE fucking days. So, then I say ok. I&#39;m just going to leave her the fuck alone. That night she flips the fuck out at me on WoW, saying that I need to pay bills. They owed me money though so I didn&#39;t owe them jack shit.

I&#39;mma contuine this when I&#39;m not at work!"

"event","<p>Editing this :3 &lt;3<br /><br /><br />Crimson red hair waved over the man's back as he walked down the hall, he had just gotten to work and on one of his days off!&nbsp;This had better be good to bring him here.... Sighing heavily to his self he paused for a moment before walking into the holding cells that was right across from the Turk's office, yelling, he knew that voice but he couldn't put a finger on it.... a voice from his past... and yet he didn't know it at the same time. It was young... almost to young..... Seventeen at the most, thinking on how the voice belonged to he stood there for a moment before walking into the room, small snerk on his lips as he saw who it was. One of the three silver haired men that they had been chasing for months on end, and this was the best they could do? Bring in the youngest one... great this wasn't going to be easy or fun for him. But what the hell he would make it as fun as it could be.</p><p>The yelling stopped when Reno walked into the room, Kadaj looked away and just let his self bleed. Something he didn't care about, his mother would bring him back if anything happen to him.... she did love him right? Why wouldn't she? He was one of her son's. &quot;So, tell me why you are hear today&nbsp;Kadaj&quot;&nbsp;he purred out loudly as he licked those plump lips of his, EMR moving to the youths neck to lift up his head and at the same time send a jold of elctricity threw the silver haired boys body.<br /><br />&quot;You know... damn right....why...&quot; mumbling under his breath Kadaj tried to keep tears from falling out of his eyes, he couldn't show weekness here. Not infront of this man no, he had to show how strong he was.<br /><br />&quot;Hmmmm, do I? You sure about that?&quot; he smirked at this and kneeled down a bit, looking over Kadaj's lithe naked body. For how young he was, he had an amazingly toned body, no fat anywere... least what he could see. Blood covered most of the boys body, so it was hard to know if their was fat or not</p><p>&quot;Nothing, just watching you in pain&quot; he said with a smirk on his face, though it looked like he sympathized the youth. Something a Turk should never do. &quot;You want out of here right?&quot; he saod softly as he kneeled infront of Kadaj. Who spit in his face glaring at him with his Mako infested eyes.</p><p>&quot;Do, but not with you&quot; He growled and tried to kick him, but yelped when he moved his leg that was broken. The red head sighed softly and helped him out of the restrains, gently helping him up and offering his coat at the same time &quot;...don't help me.&quot; he didn't take the coat as he stood up, falling right back down onto his ass. The red head gave a sigh and picked up the youth. Heading towards the doors of the lab amazed that no one was trying to stop him.</p><p>&quot;Weird...&quot; He said to his self as he looked around while walking out of the front of the biulding to his car. &quot;Hmm...&quot; Kadaj raised a eyebrow when the man said this, his hair was rather messy from what he had done. He had been near the Helicoter all Day. Something the Turk loved, yet didn't at the same time. He hated messy hair, it pissed him off Very much. &quot;great...&quot; he said as he leaned back in the seat, the youth raising a eyebrow.</p><p>&quot;And where here.&quot; he said softly, as he pulled his hair out of it's tie.</p><p>&quot;...Were?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shin-ra of course&quot; he rolled his eyes as he got out, going to bed the Youth. Sigh passing his lips, something he loved when he got stupid questions Sacasim. Something the read head loved to use. He even used it on his Boss, Rufus and Tseng. Though they hated it they knew it was part of him and just looked it over.</p><p>&quot;Great, asshole&quot; he said with a growl as he was forced out of the car and into the apartment.</p><p>&quot;Your welcome&quot; he smirked and walked into the place. It was rather messy and looked like a tornado went threw it, There were bottles of Whiskey all over, and what looked must have been some work clothing under them.</p><p>&quot;...What the hell is this? It looks like a mess here.&quot; Reno just smirked and moved to put him on the counter before going to makes him some food.</p><p>&quot;I'll clean tomorrow...&quot; he grumbled as he made some Ramen for the both of them, and while it was cooking he made his way to the table, pausing when he saw Kadaj walk to the table &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Cleaning&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Not right now.. You need to heal&quot; He didn't say anything as he limped, picking up the bottles of whiskey.</p><p>&quot;I don't need to. I'm alright...&quot; he yelped when he fell onto the floor, holding onto his leg. &quot;for fuck...&quot; The red head sighed and went to help him up, going to his room. Azingly enought his room was rather clean. Nothing on the floor, the only thing out of place in that mans room was a single cup on the night stand. &quot;I'm alrig-...wow.&quot; He looked around amazed. &quot;It's clean&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah... Thanks...&quot; he put the man down on the bed and went to get his first aid kit to stop the wounds on the boy. Kadaj looked around the room, still amazed about how clean it was compaired to the other room. Few minutes later the red head turk walked out of the bathroom and sighed looking over the now bloody bed of his. &quot;looks like I need a new bed...&quot; he said with a loud sigh, which made Kadaj raises a eye brow the look at how much he was bleeding.</p><p>&quot;Sorry&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's alright.&quot; he said as he sat down and took the youths clothing, whincing at the sight of all the cuts and bruises on his body, the most severr of them all was the one running up the boys leg and up his thigh. &quot;oh god...&quot; he said as he turned a pail green colour as he cleaned the wounds. Making Kadaj hiss and try to move away from him.</p><p>&quot;D-...don't...&quot; he whimpered and tried to move away from the rubbing alchohol that he was putting on the wounds before cleaning them out.</p><p>&quot;Don't be such a whimp.&quot;</p><p>&quot;shut up...&quot; Reno smirked and leaned down to kiss him when he was done, making him blush rather heavily.</p><p>&quot;R-...reno?&quot; he mumbled against the others lips, while a hand moved to play with his hair</p><p>Reno sighed heavily as he leaned against the back of his couch as he closed his eyes. This had been the first day in months that he had relaxed, acctually it was more like the first time since he had brought Kadaj home. He had been told to stay home with the boy, since he had took him home that night &quot;Kadaj...&quot;</p><p>&quot;hm?&quot; He smiled at the other as he turned and walked towards him a bright smile on his face. &quot;what is it?&quot; he pured as he sat beside the one that had saved him.</p><p>&quot;...Nothing&quot; he said softly putting a smile on his lips, blushing when Kadaj kissed him, with a laugh. &quot;Whats so funny?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just so cute&quot; he squealled and walked away, shaking his hips at the man.</p><p>&quot;right...cute...&quot; he snorted and got up to walk out of the place going to work, even though he wasn't supposed to.</p>"

"event","So it's been a year since my last post........ and Moving out FAILED&nbsp;ME. I moved to another town, were I was close to family, my dads side to be exact. Which I thought would be good, cause if something happened I would be able to get help from them. But it I was wrong; ok this is what happen.<br /><br />I got a job by second day of being in Edmonton, min. wage but that was all right, it's not like I would need all that much to live. I made deals with my room mates and my Tifa's parents, so I would be able to get what I needed, or do what I wanted. So it was good... then the third day mom phones me, saying that I&nbsp;HAVE&nbsp;to come home... Cause I need to finish school, then I can move back, she she gets my uncle to come and get me the next day, and this is after working for three days..... so I had to give them next to nothing notice about not coming into work that night &gt;&lt;;;. So that trip home, a five hour drive was just my uncle telling me not to fuck over my life, and not finish schoolings.<br /><br />..... So I get home and finished I think the second month of the second semster, get soooo stressed out from people, my parents and life in general I quited.... Not the best Idea I know, but I had to get stress off my chest... its not like I would be able to quite my job... my parents would have spazzed about that, so I chose to quit school, and I moves out a month after coming back as well.... That didn't turn out well, it was nice for the first day. But I have a routine for getting ready for school; I shower at 7, talking on MSN for a bit, then playing some games, and then leave for school. But no, not at this place, I had to clean before school to make sure a cat didn't piss on ANY of my clothing. That was fun, and it was even more fun, since the people were FUCKING&nbsp;PIGS. I mean so bad, that they had FRUIT&nbsp;FLYS&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;HOUSE! Make me gag...... But any ways I moves home, and forot about some of my things.... then they moved. NOT&nbsp;TELLING&nbsp;ME, so they threw out all my anime, Loveless, Neon Genesis Evangelion [whole series plus the movies], Death note vol. 1, along with over $700 worht of DVD's some wallscrolls I rather love and that have meaning to me, along with a present from a friend [moogle plushie] and a plushie I've had since I was like 2..... so I'm not happy with them at all.<br /><br />But any ways, so here I am right know, being told that I wont get kicked out if I stay in school and I'm not being forced to get a job since I have to stay on track with school. Well that doesn't work, I'm being told that I can't do anything I want to do, cause the teachers don't know that I don't really like to talk at school. So I get a phone call from the school every day and it makes me mad.... and today I'm in a bad mood, and not feeling good with a Migrain I've had since I've waken up this morning, and here comes mom, I'm on my laptop in the kitchen, my sister spills water all over the floor and I get yelled at.... so mom threats to kill the internet (not that, she uses it either &gt;&gt;&nbsp;Dumbass) and I get in a foul mood, and out of know were she says &quot;Well looks like your not Graduating, I'm not paying Grad fee's for you, or anything.&quot; So my mood gets worse and I go to say something, and another remark comes from her along the lines of &quot;You were drinking last night weren't you?&quot; I admit I do go to my friends and drink, but not on a school night, and the last time was.... god... May?! So I told her no, and then she comes up with this &quot;Well you go over to those asshole's place and you better live with them&quot; ...... I hate my family, there so stupid... <strong>apprently NOT </strong>controlling at all....<br /><p>OH and get this.... mom asked me if my sister could use what markers I have, and all I have are copics and Prisma's and I don't let <strong>any one</strong> touch those, so I told mom this and she freaked, and pulled the &quot;i'm not paying your grad fee's and get a job, cause i'm not buying you anything&quot; Not pushing me to get a job yea right............. also, I've been asking for a cat for months know, and my sisters cat is slowly becoming a fucking retard and pooping on the floor in my sisters room, so I've been asking again and sucking up..... every time I ask for an animal, mom says not, but if were in another town and my sister wants an animal its &quot;alright holly, cause I love you more than your sister. So I'll spoil you and make her work for everything she wants.&quot; .......... I hate my family....<br /><br />But I'm done my year long rant... I'm either going to puke.... or to sleep....<br />&nbsp;</p><br />"

"event","""But Vergil Onii-chan!""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Those words they have haunted Vergil since he left Dante with there mother when she was died, it was hard for him to leave his little brother after his mother died protecting them for the Demon attack after there father Sparda died while trying to seal the underworld for the human world. ""Dante what would you do if I came back to you?"" Vergil had finally found were Dante was living, he was living in a small shack he bought him self (what job?) but it was nice from what Vergil saw.

""Onii-chan come back."" Dante couldn't have a good night sleep since Vergil left him, Dante missed Vergil's warm body beside his at night it was comferting to him when he was a kid know his brother was there for him when he needed him. ""Vergil why did you leave me?""

Vergil was sitting on a building were he could see into Dante's window, he could tell Dante was having a hard time sleeping. ""I should go see him,"" Vergil wanted to go see his beloved brother but something inside him wanted to stay and watch.

Dante could feel some one looking at him so he went to the window to look out. ""Vergil?"" He could who was watching him fro the aura and it was Vergil watching him tonight, so he went to the window. But when he look out he saw nothing.

""Shit,"" Vergil forgot that Dante's powers were stronger then his own. ""Fine Dante you already know I'm here, might as well come and see you.""

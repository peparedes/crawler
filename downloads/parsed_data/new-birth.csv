"event","A part of me really hates the idea of a friends-only journal.

As times change and personal needs change, it is important to be flexible and realistic.

Big Brother is watching.  Will having a friends-only journal stop him from watching? No.

But it will make it just a little bit harder for him to watch...

Paranoia much?  No, not really. I just have my eyes wide open.

""1984"" has arrived, ladies and gentlemen.

So...you know the drill...please comment to be added."

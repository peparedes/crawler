"event","it's 3 am and i just got done writting jay our story from the day we met till now. thats a whole year and 4 months long.  im getting tired. i cried so hard when i wrote that story... the things i have done to fuck everything up blah! i hate it. i hate myself for doing things that i regret totally. i swear i am a total screw up at times and it bothers me alot. jay said its ok that  he has forgave me. which is good cause if not i dont think i could live anylonger i would kill myself of shame. thats so sad isnt it? 
my butt hurts my eyes are all baggy and black cause i need sleep but i want to hear what jay thought. gosh why does time have to fly by so fast? grrrrrrrr i wish valerie would get on aol. brad is a total immature little boy. hes so lame and stupid that its pathetic. i thought he was so different. blah ohh well hes a LOSER!!!  today was a weird day actually to many stupid things happened. i saw my uncle today i dont know why i get so excited when i see my uncles. i guess cause they are da best!!!! yay for them. i still have no mail i will continue writting till i get mail. and if i dont get mail i will say goodnight here and tell jay goodnight and go to bed i will give it 5 minutes. i have been reading others live journals  very interesting what others think and what they do in there life. i guess us that dont have lives have these stupid journals lol. im getting really nervous about going to NC with jay i dont know what it's gonna be like or anything but i do think its gonna be good for me to get away from this place maybe i wil lcome back with a better attitude thats even if i do come back.  well i guess i will go im cold and tired. its about 32 below outside everything is icy hhahaha i do love nights like this but they can suck. byebye for now goodnight"

"event","This week went by so fast but Im pretty sure it was awesome.
Monday I went to school and did tests and quizzes and reviewed for finals. I went to the film festival during english. Christian brought in his guitar and sang hotel California. I fell asleep. I helped Deanna hand out yearbooks after school. We got all excited that we're going to school together. And I think I went to Panera with Jaclyn. Yeah I did and then we went to the lake for 12 seconds and then she brought me home. I showed everyone my yearbook and then I went for a walk with Paulie. Then Kim told me about the Kmart commercial VIA my mom's cellphone. 


Tuesday I went to school again and it was okay I guess. I watched Forrest Gump first period. Sisco said hes leaving second period. Third period was a waste of time. In stats we has and ice cream party sponsered by mcdonalds. Fifth I sat in jaclyn and trish'd current issues class and had people sign my yearbook. English I dont really remember. I think I sat with Glenn adn talked to him all period but Im not sure. We left early bc it was so hot. After school I did soemthign around here an dthen I went to Margauxs for a really long time to do stuff for the commercial.

Wednesday I went to school and it was lame I think. First I watched Forrest Gump and then walked around for 20 minutes with Jackson. Second period I think we signed yearbooks and I found out I wasnt exempt unless I handed in the essay I never did. I think I ate a muffin. Third was a waste of time again except I wore my gigglepuss shirt and  we had a party. I went to the caf during stats. Lunch I went to current issues againa nd then went to my lunch 20minutes intto the period. It was nice. I left at 1215 to go to the city for th Kmart thign and it was sweet the studio was just like in movies I was so happy. The video guy was hot. It was fun. I came home and John came over and we watched a girl next door and he bonded with my mom. Hes a cool kid. 


Thursday I had my history final. Ibrahim drove me home. Then I went to the mall with my family. Dec came over and we watched Raise your voice and decided HIlary Duff was awesome. Then I out to the A&P with Jaclyn to get my pictures. When we were leaving some guy was complaining bc some guy in the produce dept. threw a fruit at him.  

Friday i had my physics final. Trish drove me there and then we had grad practice and Noble drove me home. She came over for a while and we had ice cream and watched a little bit of mean girls. Then Greg came over and we watched Life Aquatic. Then Stokes came over and we ate ice cream againa dn watched Bad Boys 2 and then Dec came over and we decided we need something to do. So we went to Stokes' house to get clothes so she could sleep over and then we stopped by Fish n booz to visit cutter and mikey d and fields. It was so awesome. Slayton was there and he was GONE and it made me so happy. We took pictures. We saw Danielles mom too. It was amazing. Artim was there and I had Lobster Bisque. i gave Dalton a tip and we went to leave and Fields followed us. I called Jaclyn so we stopped by her house adn then Jeff calle dan wanted to come party at my house but I told him my parents were home so we all went back to my house except Jaclyn. Jeff showed up with a bunch of ppl like BJ, Glenn, Jessi, Colin and some other ppl i dont know. Then they left and Colin invited us to his beach house. Fields took us back to Jaclyn's and we went to get gas. Fields went home. We got stuck behind the longest train in the tristate area and it was funny. we had soo much fun even though I dont remember what we did after that. Me and Stokes assed out in my bed and woke up the next morning still wearing our jeans.

Yesturday me a Stokes slept way late. I cleaned up a little bit then socialized with my grandparents firends then went to Steph's grad party. i spent most of the time with Savy. We played volley ball and what not. Sean and Trish and Jacki and Lauren and Coc and Dec and about a million other ppl were there. It was way fun. I left at 6 ish to go to Lackner's dance recital. Afterwards i went to the diner with her and her family and the sisters O neil and Zachagnini(sp?). I had grilled cheese and then Lackner drove me home. I went back to Stephs around 9 and hungout there for a long ass time with her Savvy and Diana and Temp and Dec and caused mad trouble I cant even put in here. Dec came over and we tried to find a ride to Colins but we couldnt so we went home and I passed out around 3. 


Today I need to clean my room and myself and then eat ice creama nd sit around. My english and spanish finals are tomorrow. Fuck that."

A lot to say so lets get started.
Prom was last Thursday and it was amazing. It was the greatest natural high I have ever felt in my life. I looked pretty but Mike looked amazing. I felt so lucky I was his date. I actually couldnt believe it was real. I still can't, It was like a dream. 
Friday I went down the shore and it was fun. im glad i saw all people I saw like Palij and Lackner adn Jessi and Geroge adn Margaux and Sharpe and I dont know just everyone. We left sunday real early then I went to a barbeque with my mom and stuff.I was in a bad mood from going to late and leaving so early but it didnt matter what I wanted. Monday I was in a crappy mood bc I wasnt firends with Cait anymore. Tuesday I got over it and decided she wasnt a good friend in the first place and I couldnt afford her anymore anyway. Wednesday I went swimming in Danielle's lake with her and Mike. Then Stokes came by and we went to Wok N Sushi and walmart to get shirts. Mike stole boxers and they were to big. We went back to Danielles and me her and Mike went swimming. We spent about 3 hours in the hot tub and then I slept over there. Mike left around 4 and then He came to pick me up at 610-ish and then drove me to school to. Afterschool on Thursday I went back to the lake with Jessi and Margaux was there. We swam and whatnot then went to get pizza. We went back to the lake after margaux went home and then after a while Jessi went home. And then around 8 Mike took me home. Fri day was insane. Stokes Dec and Nole came over. We got the house ready for my get together and then people started coming around 9. Aaorn D and Wyman came over. Lackner only came for an hour because she was having a bad day. Mike was at a prom which made me sad because I wanted him here. Crappy came over iwth Black haus and Rasrry Smirnoff. We took the first shot of the night it was black haus and Laren called it black hawk so everytime we drank it we said 'black hawk down' and we drank the smirnoff and said 'straight up like Alfalfa' . Me and crappy and noble made cookies. More ppl came.With more Alcohol.  Jessi Jeff BJ and Keith had 2 bottle of 151 and Cat. and malibu. Then Deanna Don brought a 30 pack, Polis and Teddy brought a case of Yuengling. And then Greg and Jackie and Tim came over. I was gettting pretty bad but I think Dec and Stokes were the worst. Noble spent the night in my bathroom adn Crappy was in my mom's bathroom. Polis and Teddy peed in my mom's shower. Gross haha. Dec got really horny it was the funniest thing I had ever seen. Cait Brown and Kristen Mancuso came and then I dont really remember much after that. Except that Tim had to physically pick up Steph Dec and hold her in bed bc she kept saying she need to find some penis. Noble, Tim and Dec were in my bedroom me and Crappy were in my mom's room and Lauren ended up in Blakes room. I had fun and I could give a shit what everyone else thought. But the general concenusus is that it was a good time. Saturday I went to a family party with greg after I made shirts with Stokes. I didnt get home til late. Today was a lazy day I just want to sleep but I have to write my english term paper. Right now I think my sumr is gonna be amazing. I hope to spend the days at the beach with danielle and stokes and spend the nights getting drunk with jessi and jeff.I needed a good weekend. I got it haha."

"event","well Blake was with us this weekend and while he was here Tim cut his hair real short like a buzz cut. And he went home yesturday and his mom called Tim and statrted cursing him out telling him how rediculous Blake's hair looked.And today Tim had to drop off Blake's back pack because he left it our house. So Tim was walking to the room and the principal was walking out. An dthe principal says ""Its okay Mr.Florio, Blake is out of the closet now."" And Tim didnt know what the hell was going on. Turns out Blake was sitting in the closet with a hat on because of what his mother said about his hair. Even though he was fine and even modeling for Yman and Dec when they were here Friday night."

This weekend was so good. 
Friday at 4 BxH went to Boston and it took 5 hours to get there bc of traffic. We had a killer time even thought it was dead except for pubs, clubs and tittie bars AKA Glass Slippers. Uh See CJ's LJ for the pictures. We go tlost in Mass for 2 hours which sucked due to asshole driving horn loving red sox fans. We slept in a shady ass park and ride from like 3 til 7. Then we made it home in 3 hours. When we stopped to get gas the guy asked Jaclyn why the car was smoking. She said it was bc shed been driving for a while...she left out the 90mph part. Uh then Cait went home and we went to McD's and I filled out an splication. Gross I know. THen I came home and slept. And when I woke up Lauren couldnt go to the show so I was bugging out and then Marc Jackson backed out bc hes a bitch so I wanted to cry. But CJ called some V Town biddies and they came through. So me Cait Jaclyn and Citter left at around 4 and it was an incredible show. From First to Last opened with Emily. I can die a happy woman. Motion City Soundtrack was okay teh keyboarder was hxc he was doing handstands and shit. Matchbook Romance was amazing. My throat was on fire butI was screaming the words anyway. i think Judas is rediculously good looking. It was probly the best show I have ever seen. They dont tour around here until the fall which is also when their next cd is coming out. I was supposed to have people over this morning but I slept until 4 instead. Im such a bum. I need to shower and uh go to McD's with Jaclyn. No school til 1030 tomorrow yippie!"

For a while I thought Henry Street didnt exist anymore but we found it eventually. Then we went to Newport mall and shopped and stole a carwash. I went to the Tsunami reilef show on Sunday and had a good time. I met a bunch of people and laughed a whole lot. Monday I had practice and Tuesday was yesturday and im pretty sure I slept all day bc practice was cancelled and teh power went out so I had nothing to do. Today i have practice after school and then I might be going to Babies r us with my sister. Tomorrow is friday and I dont have plans as usual. I have competitions Sat and Sun. Which kills my weekend.

On teh way home we followed Griffin and Dustin and DLo was in the back. All he kapt talking about was his DAME shortcut. Never again. Uh Yesturday i saw my dad but thats not something Im gonna go into. Then I went shopping with my mom and I came home and cleaned my room. After I showered Lauren came and picked me up and we went to Crappy's house and hung out with the hockey boys.

Uh today we had the gay cheering thing, I mostly hung out with Lauren. Grandpa came it was awesome. Then me and Lauren escaped early to go to the hockey game. It was amazing. WMC aint nothign but a bunch of Punk Ass Bitches. We stayed with Jaclyn Trish Katie Morrow and Cait. It was intense. Chris Kattana, Sotnyk and Mickey Polis were just killing bitches the whole time. Steve had a good game and Tim got hurt so we were all emotionally drained by the end of the game. <33333 Hockey =D"

So yeah the show Sunday was amazing. We decided we are forming a cover band called mosh box 20 or match book 20. we havent decided. we will and wen we do we are going to rock your worlds. Jaclyn likes to drive us around umm and what else has went on. hmm Flashdancing. 90s mixes and sleepovers too. My comp is broken again. and britney Spears is fat but me and Cait agree wed still trade bodies with her. except i would have to trade faces too bc itd be weird to have a white body and a face thats a little darker. Such as mine. Oh yeah last night I went to the campsite with Jelena and some girl and Steph Longo and Jelenas bf and this kid who blew smoke rings. Too many laughs and jelena made me feel really funny. Ps i got a myspace and its cool and Don makes fun of me and it breaks my heart into 14 pieces. But thats okay. these things make us grow. Like Caits friend jen's Jesus experienced. "" Jesus says he touched your heart but he just molested you alittle."" yeah we are going to hell. we know.

Girl: Slow down. Im scared.

Guy: No this is fun.

Girl: No its not. Please, its too scary!

Guy: Then tell me you love me.

Girl: Fine, I love you. Slow down!

Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.

::Girl hugs him::

Guy: Can you take my helmet off & put it on yourself? Its bugging me.

(In the paper the next day):
A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. 2 people were on it, but only 1 survived. The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him & felt her hug 1 last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die. If there is anyone in life you love this much, please repost this."

I walked to Jess's house and tehn we cam back here to see if my sis wanted to walk with us to Mcdonalds,and she ended up getting Jeff to drive us. It was a great time. Umm yeah WAS a great time until they needed help fixing teh shake machine. Since I was there to fill out an application, the second I was done they had me behind the counter helping Jeff fix the taylor Ice Cream Machine. Hes so funny. Emanuela said i could start Monday at 5. Im getting paid $6 and hour until i get my papers processed. Once I get trained Jeff says Ill be manager right away becaus eof my ""skills"" with the machine. Thank goodness for Carvel. So any way Ryan Doka and effin kenny Corrales were working and It was fun. Kenny's lil coloblian fro didnt fit under his hat. It was so funny. Um then this kid came in and he rememinded me so much of TJ. But then I found out hes like 13 and I was upset. Omg he was so funny he got into a fight with Mat and asked to speak to Manuela. Then he came in wearing Ryan's shirt and said he worked there. It was great. They called teh cops to get himn out butthey all scattered b4 the cops got there.Umm I felt really bad because Jess sat there and waited for me for like an hour when her dad picked her up. I told her I would go any where with her to make it up. Haha I love that girl shes too funny lol. Umm Then i was waiting for my mom to come pick me up but she never did so Sudol and Wyman came and picke dme up from The MD's and we came back to a locked door. And guess who didnt have a key lol. Yeah good guess. ME! They scared the crap outta me with her stupid fucking blue light lol. we came in when the fam got home and then we watched most of Boondock Saints. And laughed our ASSES off like we always do...Wyman and I know every word to the damn movie anyway. Umm After they left I got real tired and tehn jeff and Court came over after work. It was funny. They were sleeping over but my mom didnt know so they took all the blankets into Courts car. Then they got arrested and her car got towed. Of corse. So yeah I had a great time yesturday and now I feel liek crap. But hey I got 2 jobs and im happy. tuesdays fri and sat ill be at Grill room and evry other day ill be at MD's."

"event","Yeah I've decided to quit the journal thing. Not my scene. Its cool when cool people with interesting lives do it, like Cait's friends. They do cool things and have intersting lives. Mine is worthless because I am a dismal failure at doing anything remotely interesting. When Im having fun thats cool...I guess NOBODY gets my sense of fun lol. But I love Nick hes the shit. And I like having a crush on him. Worse comes to worse...some one telsl him. Ehm JACLYN! Shes crazy. And does a lot of drugs. Just kidding. Today I had debate pictures. I looked like hell bc i got 3 hours of sleep. I was up scared all night bc i got like 8 chain IMs last night saying some chick was gonna come kill me. Yeah I was supposed to send it to 20 people and i have a grand total of 14 people on my buddylist...and the 2nd sn has even less lol. Im so tired and pissed off bc I found out teh job I applyed for is Unavailable for transporting me there....eventhough i can get a ride. Effin douchebags. Now me and Cait actually have to look. which sux. A lot. BUT GMA IS BACK!!!! so im going to go chilly with her. Adios

"event","Way too lazy to explain what I did this weekend...Cait did it for me kinda....(Thanks Cait. this is her entry with some minor adjustments.

friday: school was of course awful, what else is new? changed our mind about going to the state b-ball game we eventually decided to go. it was pretty good.  but ANYWAYS the lady falcons won! w00t. so that was cool. ermm then we all went back to my house. mom made us mad snacks and we watched 8 crazy nights. ""jokes on you- i cant read!"" haha. i love it. then everyone left and I passed out.

today: got ready for queens. picked up cait and Steph Dec, we went and got erica, saw some peacocks (which was a shock to me, i never thought they were navtive to new jersey, and especially not the mts. that im in) and then yeah made our way to queens. it was an amusing ride, listened to some b. spears, jessica simpson and punk goes pop.. it was fun. got the tour of everywhere I used to go to/live at/hang out at haha. went to my orthodontist and did some crazy triva. then we went to the movies. saw eurotrip which was amusing. not the best, but not bad. umm then we went to a diner, which was cool. had a cheeseburger.(Big ups to the Jackson Hole) melt. good times. then we came home. had to help blake with his reading (god help us) lol. then we all went back to my house. jackie came over. talked, had some chocolate fondu it was delicious. jackie had milk come out of her nose *cracks up* oh god it was funny. then we took a walk after jackie had a spazz attack and left without saying anything. lol. met up with jess and walked her to meet her boyfriend. then just took a walk over to jackies, she said she looked for us, but she was lying. so we went back to my crib. then ericas dad came and them. it was a crazy crazy day.
 YEah that was way easier. I should do that all teh time lol. Umm so yesturday I talked to nick v. We got a crazy history. Hes actually the shit. lol. um then today i got ready for school and find out i had none. then i napped. then played Xbox for a good 2 hours.

"event","Im so effin full ahora. Yeah so today I had school. Science HSPAs first period and blah blah blah. So Yeah after school I took the bus and skipped choir. I met Jess's friend Jess. And they stoppped by and we decided to walk to A&P. They thought it was hilarious that they were dragging a city girl through the woods. I didnt find it funny.Jess got pissed BC her pics were F*cked up. Then we went to Mickey D's and ate some stuff. Ran into some ""Old Friends"" And then walked to the $1 store...which id never been in before. They talked to their buddy and then we hid behind a payphone and Jess(2)'s mom came and picked us up.I went to Jess's house for a while and looked at pics and then we talked about how fat I am and fun things like that. Shes a cool kid. Then I came home and decided not to go to the bball game and Cait was gonna come over and we were just gonna be lazy. But Steph Dec called and said ""What Are you Doing Right now?"" I said nothing and she sed that I was goin to the game. So me and Cait went. It was fun. Jaclyn met us and they all came herre afterr. (Congrats to the Lady Falcons on quite the exciting victory.) And we watched 8 Crazy nights and the ""If you had my love"" video. We think Jennifer Lopez was way hotter when her first CD came out. Now she's to diva and tries to hard.Then CJ played Steph Dec in Checkers and Dec was the Victor.Tehn they left and Im so full Im gonna be sick. Not really. Oh and Yman won the obscene candid phone call contest. She stayed on the phone with Blake speaking Crazy for 1 minute and 23 seconds. Were gonna have to get her a prize. Umm tomorrow Im going to see a movie in College Point...For those in NJ thats in Queens...which is in NY. Yeah. Ummm tonight um Cait, Jaclyn and Step decided to come. So its all of us and Erica K+lemens. And Sunday I;m supposed to go to teh mall with Steph Dec. She Got Her LISCENSE!!! Im pumped like crazy whoa...ha.

"event","mmm sick again
i've been to the doctor 3 times this month
all they do is play finding nemo in the waiting room
i hate nemo... i must kill nemo
but anyway....
well monday was a snow day!! and andrew wuz ungrounded!!
we had band practice with all 3 of us for the first time in a month then me andrew and chris met up with jen jay kaleigh crystal and mike and we all went to jays to watch our home movies we made in the summer... there so funny.. MATEING SEASON MATEING SEASON...im not saying anything or that certain person will get mad LMAO
on weds. me jay max bryan and brenden went to woodland while they were still having 9th period... jay and bryan decided to start wrestling in front of the whole skool... 300-400 kids must have been cheering them on.. funny as hell
we said hi to our old bus driver, marvin
he was actually pretty nice to us... considering the fact that toward the end of the year he found out we were sneaking on his bus.. he was always talking about me and jay (mostly jay) disrespecting him... i wonder what he could be talking about?"

"event","ahhhhhh life is going just great...
andrew gets burned on his face b/c hes stupid and now i hear he has to get plastic surgery 
and now hes grounded 4 god knows how long and i dont know if he is gonna miss the show at trinity... if he would just shut the fuck up and listen to what his parents have to say then they might let him play... but doesnt seem to be going too well....
why does something bad happen everytime we have a show coming up soon"

"event","heyyyyyyy its sunday...
just got back from the city with the calvary, fun stuff.  Alot of fun moments, lmao chris's mom told me that for breakfast.... chris ate this dinasour cereal where there just eggs, but when you add milk, the eggs hatch into dinasours.  wtf is that lol.  The best part was deff. when dave took the free stress test on the street and when he was done this lady would not let him walk away without buying a book.  
Lady : would you like to buy a book?
dave : im not much of a reader
lady : thats ok we have a dvd
dave : dammit

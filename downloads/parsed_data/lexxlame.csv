"event","I'm really kinda confused at the moment. It's like I love Photography. But it's getting to the point where it is just to easy for me. What I mean is that now it comes nautraly.&nbsp; And I hate that it's easy. I wanna be challenged. But there's nothing there to make it hard any more. In the begining it was but now I could do it in my sleep.&nbsp;
I'm starting to really like drawing now though. But I'm not very good. And it's starting to be like thats all I do. I never pick up a camera any more. But I'm always drawing.&nbsp; Should I keep with this? See drawing now is like it helps me calm down. Like when I get really madd or I want to cry or something it will make everything better.&nbsp;
Should I take an art class? To see if I can pursue it. But I'm starting to worry. Because I'm starting to look at collages and I'm worryed that I won't know what I want to do when it comes down to turning in my proflio's.&nbsp; I'm just scared that if I do decide that I want to go for photography am I going to regret it in the end? Or Get bored with it? I just can't keep taking breaks like I have been. What do I do?&nbsp;

Hopefully it comes out good, if not, i`ll be hella pissed. My pics from my shoot with John Gleim came out good, so you can check them out on myspace.com/___nickyxo

Other than my shoot, nothing else is new. Except me and brit decided to get a tanning package at this awesome salon near school. Its so nice in there, and I can't wait to be really tan again lol."

"event","Hey, haven't updated this thing in quite some time, but I decided to on account I don't leave for class for another 20-25 minutes and I'm bored sitting around my room. 
So I moved into school and am a week in. I love my roommates and my new apartment. I dont know how much I love having 3 psych classes this semester, but eh we'll see. Campus is beautiful, and I can't wait until the first home football game, which is not this weekend, but the next. And then the following is homecoming, I think. For the first time, in ever.. I will have school spirit. I've changed high schools so many times, I never really had any school spirit for one particular school. But now I can.

I guess, I better go. I should be studying for my psychology quiz today. O well. I can do that after class.

Things are starting to come together. After a summer of stress, not much excitement, and work, <strong>I finally paid my apt.</strong> and I got my roomates. I'm so excited. On my own, isn't going to be easy, but I definately can't wait for the long awaited ""college life"". After a year at community, I can't wait to finally move on. I can't say that community was horrible. I made a good friend Nicole, who I know I can call whenever life throws me down a bad path, or just when I need someone to talk to. She's amazing. Hmm, but yeah. I'm super excited and finally I can look forward to something. other than that, nothing is new. Tomorrow's my dads birthday, So while hes out getting Tara's school records, I'm running over to Walmart and buying him something and a cake and balloons.

I've been so stressed with loans and stuff for school. And now that my grandmom can't find her 2006 tax information, my 16000 loan can't be processed. so now I'm stuck back at square one. I don't know how exactly I will be paying for my 600 dollar rent each month. Hopefully a good job opens up and I can get it. As of right now, I am ttrying to save every single penny. Starting with my next paycheck. I don't get alot each week because they have been giving me less and less hours. That job has its ups and downs sometimes, I swear.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hm, ok Im not about to sit here on my day off stressing about school right now. Even though I really should be. But anyhow, on a better note.. I bought this book called The Lovely Bones. It is AMAZING. I recommend it to all. I just got it like a week ago, and I am almost done it. Haha, it gives me something to do when I am sitting on Septa for 90 percent of my day. ;]&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like all I have been doing lately, is going to work, or sitting in worrying about school. DAYM there I go again, talking about school. AHH its taking over my life I swear. And I still need to pick up another&nbsp;class. Hm, maybe I`ll do that once Im done updating this jawnskie.&nbsp;<br /><br />OOh, really AMAZING song. On my myspace- Appologize by OneRepublic and Timberland. Ah go listen to it now. Im in love with it. And I also looked up the video on youtube, and its so simple but it really hits ya hard. Its a pretty awesome song and video for sure. FOR SUREEEE. Another awesome song is by a girl names Jessie Daniels ""What I hear"". So also check that biddy up on myspace. Cause she has a kickass voice!\<br /><br />I've seriously realized how much this summer is so uneventful. I feel like its the same shit everyday these days. I wish things were random, silly, crazy... SOMETHING. Common people. I've been out of school since early May. I move into westchester on August 25th. So my last day at Ritas is August 23. I just wish I could say I accomplished something this summer. I mean I did get close with people from work, MECCA GURL, &amp; DEANNA. They pretty much rock. And I mean I did grow up quite a bit this summer. I became somewhat responsible and I am proud of myself for that. If you know me, I am the one whos always stressed out, but I'll go thru my day with a smile plastered on&nbsp;my face.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The other night, I realized that its becomming harder and harder to not think of my mom. So the other day I looked online and found that people can cope better when they just write down whatever that comes to mind. I decided that maybe it will help. So I am going to just write everything I felt that last month. From being scared to come home to a house full of grief, tears and calmness trapped within the walls, afraid to talk to her worried that she would stop breathing at any second, seeing her cancer sticken skeletal&nbsp;body succumbed to that fucking uncurable fucking disease that took over in a month, saying goodnight for the last time, telling her I loved her and singing the song that she wrote for me and used to sing to me when I was little(""Cause you're mommy's little angel, you're mommys little girl, you're daddys girlfriend"") and sitting outfront at 3am praying to God to make everything better and then cursing God the next night at the same time for taking a part of me away. You would think that, yeah I have people who care about me in my life, I should be happy I have a father. But loosing your mom is probably one of the worst things that can happen to you. I am glad that I was not younger and had to go through that. I guess I can accept it, but some days are harder than others</strong>.<br />"

"event","Have you ever just wanted to replay one moment of your life over and over again? And never let go of the memory? <u>There are times when I wish we could just drive on forever.</u> There would be no goodbye, I`ll see you next week. There would be no kiss goodbye. Have you ever wished that time would stop for one moment so you can look around and notice all the amazing things in your life, and never let anything slip past you. Today I had a random thought. What if the weeks went on and on, but the calandar days were slower. Like a week equaled day 1. I realized that its not the material items in your life, its the time that you spend with people you love. No matter what it takes to see eachother, you're going to do whatever it takes. No matter how much you fight, whenever you're together, nothing seems more perfect. Nothing is wrong and the best thing in life is that which you hold tight.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Tip of the day:</strong>&nbsp;Never let go of the things you care about most.

Ballerinas have a presence about them. They have good posture, good turnout and good feet. I have none of those. Ballerinas are on Pointe.

Anyhow, this weekend is memorial day weekend [i believe] and something fun better be going down.&nbsp;But, anyhow.. last night I was on the phone with Mike until 2 am, just chatten. Then I decided to read a little of the book I am reading, ""Pretend you dont see her"" by Mary Higgens Clark. I ended up staying up until about 4 finishing it. I couldn't put it down. Chyea. So now I am living off of about 3 hours of sleep at the most. I have work today @ fridays from noon-5. At least its not all day, thank god. Anthony from Rita's Water Ice is going to ask my old boss if they would hire me back for the summer. So if I get that job, I will work at rita's monday-thursday, work at tgifridays on friday, and once abercrombie opens back up work there on the weekends. psh thats alot of working,.but i neeeeed a car for school in the fall. if i want to have a job while i`m going to school at west chester, i am going to have to have a car.&nbsp;

Ah, so I broke tara's camera last night, so I have to buy her a new one. Thankfully I got money from the funeral, and I have enough to pay her. Ugh I was so pissed. Ended up accidentally dropping it in my basement. Because I was taking pics of her and her friend Brittany.&nbsp;"

My mom is dieing. I found out today from my uncle that shes in critical condition with her cancer, and that she may not last the whole week. I guess I never really thought it would get this bad. I guess I thought she would somehow overcome this. A part of me knows that I need to prepare myself for the worst, but a part of me still believes she`ll pull through. I pray to God she does. <strong>Tomorrow I have to go and ""say goodbye""</strong> to her. I don't know if I am going to be able to be strong and do this. I know the minute I walk into that hospital I am going to start crying. I am going to try my hardest to stay strong, for my mom. I know she is hurting and that makes me hurt so much. I know that we haven't been the closest in the past few months, and I wish we could have been closer. I wish there was just something I could have done. I wish I didn't piss her off so much in the past few months. I wish I never got kicked out of my house. I wish she would have let me move back when I wanted to. I wish she would have seen how much I cared about her, even though it may not have been easy to see. I wish I would have stopped being so stubborn and just appologize. I wish I could have told her I know shes going to pull through this. I wish I was strong. <strong>I wish I was strong.</strong> I wish I was strong. I wish I could say half of the things I want to say to her. I wish I could choke back my tears and tell her how I feel for once. Tell her how much I love her, and am grateful for all she has given me and taught me. Tell her that I`m sorry for all the trouble I've given her, and tell her that I should have been better. A better daughter. A better part of this family. A better impact on anything, something, going on in her life. I wish I could wake up tomorrow, and she would be healthy again. I wish I didn't take her for granted. My grandmom told me that I would regret things one day. And that day has come."

You're healthy, you're good, whatever ; don't feel the need to tell my mother how I ""measure up"" to other people, I get that enough as it is. UASDHASKDHSAHSAD. Okay. I'm over with the ranting.&nbsp;<br />"

"event","<strong>Goodbye amazing weekend, hello shitty week.</strong>&nbsp;<br />This weekend was great. Actually had fun. Now I'm dreading a week of bullshit consisting of a mixture of work/school/homework. <font color=""#ff0000"">Valentine's Day</font> is on Wednesday, however, so I mean at least there is something to look forward too. Whatever.<br /><br />Other than the normal monday morning stuff, nothing new happened today. Tara woke up bitching on how she didn't want to go to school today, which only started a huge argument in my house. COOOOL. She's probably the biggest winer I've ever come across in my life. Suhweet. I am just waiting right now for the library to open so I can print out the shit of a paper I had to write for today. It sucks. No, I mean it reaaaaly sucks. Not my usual ""a"" paper, for sure. Oh well, I mean I can't be perfect all the time, even thought I swear I want to be. I've diagnosed myself with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Okay maybe not exactly OCD but I mean I have to over do things all the time. Shit needs to be perfect with me. I need to be perfect. I hate being second best. I hate not knowing how to do things I should know how to do. I hate not being able to do stuff I USED to know how to do. I just hate not living up to the potential I know I have.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyhow, I am done bitching for today. I have a break today in between my classes like everyother day so I will most likely update this jawnny jawn more than once today. Idk, you'll have to wait and see.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Oh, by the way I have a runny nose and a sore throat.

Right now, me and Maggie are chillin in the library about to go get coffee or tea from the caf. I have Human Sexuality at 11:10, and then Dance at 12:45. Then work with Kevin at 3:30. FUUUUUN."

These foreigners at my school were laughing and talking in arabic or whatever they are, and all I kept thinking was that they were plotting to kill me. HAHA, i know I have a sick mind. Anyhow, once the library opens at 7:30 I can finish and print out the shitty english paper I wrote really fast last night. This week I have so much homework to catch up on. I should have done more of it yesterday, even though all I really did yesterday was homework. COOOOOl."

Trying to keep up on schoolwork, readings, etc. Working today with the amazing Kevin Ung. CHYEA. Our rides to work are the best. Nothing too exciting besides the above stuff. Monday is me and Michael's one year anniversary, so I am pretty glad about that. Longest relationship of my life? YES. I'm surprised he hasn't shot me yet. I can be such a pain sometimes, well most of the time.

It was about a man and the universe and how its not up to the universe to lead the man down life's passageways and the man only wants to take the easy way out.
YEH.
Anyhow, I'll post later about my other classes. I have a break in between my Personality Psych class and my Spanish. UGH. SPANISH."

"event","Well, I've decided to make a public livejournal, not like any of you bastards actually read this shit, but anyhow I guess I'll take time and update this thing everyday. Cute. If you have a lj I guess you should friend me if you want, because then I can friend you back. I'm not going to bullshit, or succumb to some image you already have portrayed of me. I'm more than that. In real life I'm a chill girl, a girl who you probably have called stuck-up or a ""prep"". Labels are awfully cute, how about we call you a complete and utter moron. Ha. If you haven't already noticed I drown in sarcasm. =] But yea, I'm not what you thought. I'm not what you heard. I'm me.&nbsp;

Anyhow, I want to defy reality and escape from this dirty hell of conformity and find a place with depth and find someone who will have a deep conversation with me about anything."

"event","ive discovered something about myself. something that i really wish i had known.. say.. 2 years ago.. something that could have changed alot in my life. although it probably wouldnt be the same as it is now if i had known it then. i needed to spend the last three years finding myself. but ive become fully aware of what i want in life. completly. having spent the last two months more or less takig care of cody, thomas*beccas son* and jocelyn*beccas stepdaughter* and jayden when dave is around,its hit me. i love taking care of these kids. i love having kids. i love love love it. i want that. thats it. i cant find a job i know ill love, because i already found it. i want that. i wants kids. a family. a house.. that i cook and clean up everyday.. kids, a husband who works. thats what i want. ive neveer been more relaxed and happy as i am sitting at beccas all the time taking care of the 2-4 of them.. cleaning the house.. cooking for everyone. it just feels right. i like carting them off to the store.. picking up after them.. 

why cant i just find a guy who wants that? well.. actually i think i can. i know a guy whod be great.. ijust dont know if wed be great together. i guess theres just one way to find out.. get to know dave. i already adore jayden.. so why not?? he likes me.. i know that. so what the hell.

ok well.. yea.. then theres jeb. who is a great guy.. but for a single, wanting to tour the world, have no responsibilty me. thats the old me. thats the me who was here.. two years ago. alot has changed in me within the last few months even. i dont know. i just.. need to find someone who im attracted to.. whos great .. who wants whati want.. i dont wanna leave.. join the af.. but if its the only way out of here.. then ill do it. i want to find the right guy.. the one whos gonna take care of me.. maybe i gotta travel around the world first.. who knows. ok.. whatever.. i gotta go.. fuck.. no one reads this shit anyways.."

"event","i just dont know anymore.  so last night tony came back from the field. and he wanted to talk. he kept tellin me hed been doing alot of thinking and this and that.. and i told him id been thinking to. turns out i had been. alot more then i thought i had. i decided it was time to let myself get over him. to stop hoping he would change his mind. and to start getting over him. and i tell him this. im like i dont know if we should go to the ball.. things in my head are changing.. i just dont know anymore. and hes like well then i shouldnt tell you what ive been thinking.. and i say.. no tell me.. so he does. turns out.. he misses me. he loves me still. he wants to get back together. he was gonna purpose to me. everything i had wanted all along.. and i tell him no. i cant give in. FUCKIN hell i want to give in. sooo bad.  i love him. i want him.  hes who i saw my future with. hes where i wanted to be. he makes me crazy in every way that i love. so why cant i just give in. why do i take the advice of everyone around me. they all say no. he will just break your heart again. hes just gonna change his mind again. and i know it. but why do i still want to let him try to prove me wrong.. someone help me. this is killing me. its been killing me. my life came crashing down around me the day things with us ended. you dont even know. i feel like a part of me is dead. truly dead. and i know its as simple as giving in to let that part come back to life. so why is it so hard. why do i have to be smart enough to know better.. why cant i be smart enough to not want to do it? fuck. we had our lives planned out. me and him. everything we ever wanted.. we were gonna get it. everything was right. and then things changed. he had to know what it was like with her. and i let myself hope things would be better for us. he took to long. if hed of told me this 2 weeks ago.. id be his. but he waited. if hed of just told me.  just when i pull myself out of the bottom of that bottle.. he pushes me back in.."

"event","so as of right now. im in the middle of a sticky situtation. i love however that right now ... no one knows about this account.. except amber, because i started it to read her shit... so yea... which is great. cause i cant say whatever about who ever and no one can get pissy. 

lets start with the normal bullshit.  i hate dealing with girl drama. seriously. that shit gets me down. its like. wtf bitch.. backup. they aint your guys. they were my firends first. i invited you because you were depressed.. you fuck with ones head. now flirt with the other and try to get him away from me. what the fuck you still have aboyfirend you skanky bitch.. her response.. so what if i want every guy to like  me. whats wrong with that? IM YOUR FREAKIN FRIEND thats whats wrong. every damn time i find a guy that im interested in.. she comes along and takes them. like im just supposed to give the good ones to her. because shes had a hard life or someshit. what the fuck is tat. go die. seriously. ive been through some shit and then some. and now your gonna pull this shit on me. fuck you. 

anyways.. the sticky situtation however. um yes.. what to do. ... do i stick to my normal shallow life. do i do what half of me tells me to do.. or do i let myself go, say fuck it to everyone else. i like this guy and i like what he is.. notjust how he looks or where hes going in life.. i like him. the person. ... or do i stick with hopeing that the friend isnt gonna get in the way of the one i like.. the rich one with the car and the smile... whos such a party boy its gonna get old. but still.. i dont know. im so dumb seriously dmb. the answer is obvious. get over the shallow needs. but can i. thats what i need to know. am i  capable of being the bigger human. i dont know. honeslty i dont know. id like to think so. but still... who the fuck knows. 

that and im still not over that asshole. why cant i get over him. why. he wasnt that great. he broke my heart so many times. he treated me like crap when i would go see him. i spent so much time and effort on that relationship and he just turned around and said to fuckin bad. go to hell. i didnt deserve that. no one does. but still.. fuck shit fuck. now i sound like emo ass fuckin paul.. kill me now. fuck shit. 

so .. that was my first time doin this..

im sure.. there will be more."

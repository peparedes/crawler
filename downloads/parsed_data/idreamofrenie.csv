"event","if anyone out there knows of a person, Joanna Farrell, formerly of SI, NY, moved to Las Vegas, Nevada in 1999/2000, please let me know. We were extremely close, and due to the 3000 miles and 3 hour time difference, grew apart. She recently tried to contact me, but I was not able to get her message until it was too late and she had signed off. I now have no way of finding her. I do not know if she still goes by this name, if she looks the same, where she lives, anything. But I do know that I still care and would greatly appreciate any help. 
Her east coast friends miss her!"

"event","i hardly ever get angry, but this whole dance thing is really really pissing me off...
if you don't wanna be there, don't.

if it's not where you see yourself doing what you want, or what will better you and you can't get along with anyone...why are you there? 

its bad attitudes thats ruining dance, not miss c, bad fucking attitudes.

I can't walk into the studio without wondering how i'm going to be greeted, if I recieve any...

i'm so happy that we are so mature that we can think about other peoples perspectives... i've tried, i've walked on fuckin eggshells, kept my mouth shut and just been there, tried lightenin things up... but no...

so i say fuck it... i'm gonna go there and enjoy... i may not be a true dancer... i dont go to classes in the city and i don't have the best skills in dance...but dammit i try, and i try to make it an enjoyable thing for everyone...

i can't be 18 anymore... i'm graduating college next year, i'm going to grad school after that...we all grow up ( age/numbers wise anyway)...

i used to care about the backlash that saying even this little bit might incur, and i am not talking about everyone at dance,if you have it in your mind that this refers to you... maybe it does...and consider why it may. 

i'm not talking down to anyone... ... but life is bigger than just one person. 


and i want it known that if i didn't care, this wouldn't bother me so much.

but you prob dont care about that... what do you care about? being depressed, pissed, screwed, what? do you care about yourself? dog bites, scratches, and other ""accidents"" included...
i dont know what your life has been like...but i do know its possible to rise above it...and not just for show, or when someone bends over backwards to make you happy, but genuinely. 

and i am not telling you how to live life...i just wish you would live the great one your meant to, and i'll be here."

i have so much shit to do... next year is going to be crazy...i hate life...but i love it...

Selfless, powerful, and<br>divine, you are one blessed with a certain<br>cosmic grace. You are unequalled in<br>peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of<br>Light your wings are massive and a soft white<br>or silver. Countless feathers grace them and<br>radiate the light within you for all the world<br>to see. You are a defender, protector, and<br>caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver<br>of the wrong, chances are you are taken<br>advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often.<br>But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in<br>everyone and so this mistreatment does not make<br>you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will<br>try to help misguided souls find themselves and<br>peace. However not all Angelics allow<br>themselves to be gotten the better of - the<br>Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting<br>for the sake of Justice and protection of those<br>less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever<br>change - the world needs more people like you.

"event","why do i always look for reasons to be down... well not actually say to myself oh i wanna be down today... i have the best life right now... and yet i find something to be down about...well, i hafta clean the cats box... so i'll be right back...
alright, my kitties now have clean litter... haha... clean litter... get it... oh so clever...and soon i will be lugging in the bags of food mom's bought... yay... food...

ok, i have a habit of wandering ...

ooh... so jay imed me last... um... wednesday? thursday? no wed...tuesday?... maybe tuesday... i dunno... most of last week melted into eachother, a long week of work and school and driving... with ome great sex, loving hugs and wonderful conversations thrown in... 
anyway, jay is back... apparently... i am curious as to what his motives are....
does he still love me? does he hate me, and is luring me back in so he can hurt me? does he really just want to try again, kinda from scratch?
ok, so i'm in a funk...and i need my sweetie to get out of it... actually i need to get into my heavy schedule to get out of it...
ok hafta go unload groceries...

hope everyone is well...

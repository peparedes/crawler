i feel so terrible. i feel like it's my fault. i should have made sure she wasnt around sick puppies. i feel like i've failed her. i really do love her, she's my responsibility and i fucked up."

"event","i never write in this thing anymore, jesus! anywho, i've been up to a whole lot of nothing to say the least. work has been going good, i've been working for Amanda's mom which has been great because i feel i dont need to put on my fake, professional face and i dont have to worry about her watching everything i do to make sure i'm doing my job. i can take smoke breaks whenever and eat her food if i'm hungry. i wish i could work for her all the time.
i'm getting a puppy after my birthday from one of my sister's friend. she's a toy manchester terrier and her name Lilly. she's the runt, so obviously, she's the cutest. i'm super excited. i have to pay 350 bucks for her but 100 of that is going to be paid by my parents for my birthday present. i cant wait.
life in general has been pretty good but i'm having a little trouble dealing with the whole ""girlfriend of a guy in a band"" thing. its not that he's in a band, its the fact that they are most likely going on tour this summer and i truly suck at being alone. especially if i know he's away having a great time. i dont know if i'm making the right decision about staying with him while he goes on tour or not. i dont want to get my heart broken if something bad were to happen to our relationship. i.e. other girls. i trust him completely, but when you hear that his friends dont even want us to be together, it makes it harder to be okay with it. so... i'm going to give it a shot and see how it goes. i wouldnt want to give up on our relationship so quickly. he hasnt even done anything wrong. i know there isnt anyone better for me than ricky. we do have our issues, but i wouldnt want it any other way. if we got along all the time and never argued or even screamed at each other, it wouldnt be right. we fight because we love each other. if i didnt care about what he did, we wouldnt ever fight. 
we're planning on moving out and getting our own apartment hopefully by the end of the summer or early next year. i need to get a steady paying job before any of that goes down. house cleaning is going good right now but it's a job i cant rely on. zac might be hooking me and ricky up with a paper route job. the hours are from 1:00-3:30 or so every day, and we'd be making 900 bucks a month. not too bad. the only thing is that i need to take a trip for about a week or so down to oregon to visit my grandparents, i do it every summer. this will probably be the last summer i get to spend with both of them so i cant have a job that wont allow that to happen. we'll see. i need to stop myself before i start talking about a million other things."

how come people cant make up their minds about anything? seriously, just figure out what you want and take it. its really not that hard. to quote a friend ""people need to stop thinking about what everyone else wants and figure out what THEY want. fucking pussies.""
too true. drama, drama, drama. i wish ricky would get back from band practice so we could watch a movie.
The Biggest Loser marathon is on and i'm more enthralled that i thought i'd be. its almost inspiring me to start working out and lose some chub.

gig harbor campus

tacoma campus

i got the flu a couple of days ago and it sucks pretty bad...
considering i'm a smoker.
everything is ten times worse when you're sick.
i went to the doctor and she gave me some cough medicine and told me to rest.
so i did.
what she didnt tell me was that this virus attacks the leg muscles so if you lay in bed too long, you wont be able to walk for 3 days.
thanks doc.
i was hobbling around this morning like a 82 year old war veteran.
i'm bored and there's nothing to do. 
i've discovered that x mas doesnt get me as excited as it used to.

the only reason people try to control their lovers is because they are insecure.

they control who you hang out with.

what could a girl of my height do to a grown man?
i tell you what.
make him wish he never was born.
you can beat on me.

you'd better start running."

"event","i miss my best friend. my sister. she moved away when we were younger, but i see her every month or so. she's dating this new guy now. this controlling guy. i have no way of contacting her. last time i talked to her was on her birthday in september. she engaged. i'm supposed to be her maid of honor. i want to be there for her, but i cant even talk to her. i called her parents to see if they could help me, they never returned my call. i emailed her so called ""friends"", to see if they could help me, no answer so far. 
i dont know what to do now. i miss her with all my heart, but there's nothing more for me to do.
its the worst feeing in the world to want to talk to someone so bad and know they want to talk to you too, but you cant."

i picked up my mom's weekly Life&Style trash mag and on the front it reads:
""sandra bullock: she wore boots to her wedding!"". 

do people really care what she wore on her feet to her own wedding? i'll show them one day. i'll say ""fuck you guys, i'm wearing slippers.""

"event","so i went this morning to pick up ricky at the thurston county juvenille center-thingy, and i walk through ALL the metal detectors and go through all the steps to get into the damn building, but when i finally get to talk to a human, he proceeded to tell me that i was underage therefore he could not release ricky to me.
awesome.
what made things even more awesome was that the man who told me this bit of information, then laughed in my face and shouted to his coworker ""hey Jim! this girl is here to pick up her boyfriend and she's only 17!!hahahahahahahahahah"" and cracked up for about 5 minutes. 
""i couldnt release him to you even if i wanted to"", says rude black man.
i told him i drove all the way out here (to olympia) from gig harbor and since i cant get ricky out, could i at least use a phone to call his dad?
""nope."" was all he said to me.
nope. okay you son of a bitch, there's no need to act like you're on the rag.
how can people who work in a jail be so mean to everyone? i could understand being not-so-nice to the immates, but the outsiders? c'mon. 
how was i supposed to know you had to be 18? i've never been to jail, nor have had to go get someone out of jail. do i really look like the kind of person who is familiar to a place like that? 
i can take people talking shit to me and being rude, but when you straight up laugh in my face and then joke about me to someone else, that's when it really gets to me. 
i bet that guy's life is real fun. lets work at a jail! lets laugh at things that arent funny! lets be a big douchebag to young girls who have been nothing but nice! 
i hope he gets mad cow disease."

"event","so i have a story for you all...
i was sitting outside of starbucks waiting for ricky to get off the bus. some random gig harbor scene kids sit down next to me. why? i dont know and it doesnt matter in this story. i'm reading my book when the extremely annoying girl next to me says to her friends ""awww its ricky!"". i think to myself 'okay, probably someone ricky knows'. 
later in the evening i ask him who those kids were who aparently knew him. 
ricky shoots me a look of fear and replies 'i have no fucking idea, i was going to ask you the same question'. 

that story was pretty pointless other than the fact that it helps my theory that kids from gig harbor are fucking retarded. i dont talk about people like i'm buds with them unless i am. just because i know their name, doesnt give me the right to use it to sound cool. for instance, i know OF Glenn Danzig. many do. but if i saw him walking down the street, i wouldnt turn to the person next to me and say ""aww its danzig."" 
i would probably feak out and wet myself and the outcome would most likely involve a restraining order against me, but that's besides the point.

another example would be when kids commit suicide. lots of kids were ""so depressed"" after josh died, they got into drugs and cut themselves and boo hoo blah blah blah. but the reality of everything is that, most of those kids didnt even know josh at all. i'm not saying by any means that we were best friends, but he was in my life enough to be affected by it. passing someone in the halls everyday at school and hearing that they are dead, is not a reason to go into depression. the real reason is lack of attention or the craving for more. this is a theory i would like to call ""Cool By Association"". if you know someone who is liked by your peers, faggot kids will pretend to know that person just to sound cooler.

people are idiots and need to stop being sheep and grow a set of balls so they can be their own person.

so yeah...umm...gig harbor sucks."

"event","it's odd how you can grow up so close to one person and then all of a sudden, they change directions on you and become your worst enemy. there is a war within my home and my father and i are at opposite ends.
if i try to talk to him about how he's hurting me, he gets angry and walks away.
if i dont talk to him, he gets angry and ignores me.
i'm sorry if i forget to do the laundry one day, i've been trying to figure out where my life is going.
its sad to see that you still have no idea.
as a daughter, i dont ask much. i dont ask anything at all, because if i did, he'd get angry and walk away.
all i want from him is to KNOW for sure, that he does love me.
but for some reason, that's too much to ask.
if i died tomorrow he wouldnt react, just as long as it didnt cost him any money.
lack of money is a issue in the house right now, but its no reason to neglect your family.
i strive for his pride in me. all i want to do is make him proud, but unless i'm a shakespearean actor, it will never happen."

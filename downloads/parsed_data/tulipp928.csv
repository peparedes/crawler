"event","Wow, my last entry was 40 weeks ago.  So it's been awhile.  

I graduated yesterday!  Woohoo! and I didn't trip going across the stage (even better)

I had a repeat of my senior year of high school though.  I couldn't find any of my friends afterwards to get pictures :-( Stacey did find me though, so at least I have a picture with her :-) Yay!  

I'm back home for the summer after a week at school with nate and all of my friends.  My mom is already yelling at me about getting a job for the summer, so I'm off to pound the pavement tomorrow morning.  Awesome.  Payless maybe, or build a bear.  I had an interview with Build a bear earlier in the year, but then changed my mind about working while student teaching.  I didn't think that would be a very good idea.  I think I made a wise decision, but now I don't have ANY money.  Oh well!

I'm going to Fredonia for grad school in the Fall.  I'm living by myself for the first time, so that should be interesting.  I'm paying a lot of money, but I think I will be ok.  It's also exciting that I will get to meet some new people and maybe make some new friends.  I think I'll like this change, even though I'm going to the same school.  It will be VERY different!  

Well that's it for now, I have to get back into the swing of writing in this thing!

Wow, huge movie whore I am.  102 :-)
Well the summer hasn't been very eventful, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  My grandmother is in the hospital, because she had a heart attack and her lungs filled with fluid.  We went to visit her on Long Island for the weekend and her attitude improved tremendously.  She is now in rehab and is doing much better.  It was a little touch and go for awhile, since she is 85. 

I had a party with friends from school.  Jess, Chris, Liz, Stacy, and Nate, plus Rachel came over.  We had dinner and a fire and then Jess, Chris, Stacy and Nate stayed over and we slept in the tent.  It was a lot of fun and nice to see everyone again.  Jess leaves soon for Costa Rica so who knows when I'll see her again!  She will be missed!  

I'm working on the weekends for ATM Restyle, which is Auto, Truck, and Marine accessories and apholstery.  I answer phones and wait on customers.  Who knew that I would sell car parts!  Half the time I don't know what the person is talking about!  But I get to hang out with my friend Sara from high school, b/c her finance owns the place.  It's a job and I'm happy to do it.  I'm learning a lot!  I think I annoy my parents though b/c when I see a car, I always say something about it and how much something would cost to put it on.  :-)  

Nate and I saw fireworks in Blasdell and EA.  I'm not sure which one I liked better.  Blasdell had fireworks in the shape of hearts, except that they were upside-down.  It was still really nice to see. They didn't have the whistley ones either.  I HATE THOSE!  as well as the ones that are just really loud and bright.  EA had a lot of those and some whistle ones.  Blasdell was with Sara and Chris, her fiance, so it was nice to hang out with people.  EA was with my parents.  I don't think my parents have ever been to the fireworks in town, but I think they liked it.  My dad was surprised at the number of people that were there.  He tried to sit away from the crowd, but it kept spreading and engulfed them.  Good try dad!    

Nate and I are doing well I think.  I haven't been this happy in a long time.  Probably ever.  My mom asked me the other day if ""this is a long term thing.""  I asked her what she meant and she said ""well I don't know, is it long term?  You seem to get along well.""  I told her I didn't know, but I think it very well could be :-D  It's been 3 months already and they just flew by!   Yay for being happy!  Rachel said she thought I finally got it right, and I think I did too.

Anyway, I think it's time for a nap, I was up super late last night.  Happy 4th of July!"

So it's almost the end of the year.  I have 4 more days until I leave school.  It's going to be a bittersweet ending to school though.  Jess is graduating and then going to Costa Rica for 6 months starting in July.  Then she will probably be moving down south with her boyfriend and I'll never see her again :-(  It's going to be hard to stay in touch, but I will sure try :-)  One good thing is that Nate lives in OP, only 10 minutes away from me.  No more long distance relationships for me, thank you :-)  So that should be fun.

I need to get a job for the summer, but I have no idea where I can get one.  I have a car this year so that will certainly help out.  Nate's mom works as a teacher's aid with Autistic children and I'm going to go shadow the speech pathologist at her school.  I'm looking forward to that, because I've never worked with an autistic child before.

We had our last day of clinic on thursday.  Everyone was all sad that they would be leaving their ""kiddos.""  To be perfectly honest, I was happy it was over.  Don't get me wrong, I had a great time and learned a lot, I'm just tired of all the bullshit.  It's a long story and if you want to know more, just ask.  I did take some pictures of my kids though.  My first clients ever.  It's a milestone :-)  

I'm looking forward to next year already, even though it's a little scary.  Liz and I and 2 other girls have an apartment right near campus.  So i guess that means I have to learn how to cook.  

Last night at 4:55am, I was sleeping in Nate's room and there is a mirror on the wall next to his bed.  Well that mirror decided to fall off the wall and land on my ankle.  It hurts.  A lot.  But it's only bruised.  The glass for the light on the mirror broke and cut nate's hand, but he's tough, I think he can take it:-)  The actual mirror didn't break.  Thank god.  I think his room is possessed, because I turned the TV off the other day and it turned back on by itself.  FREAKY. 

Anyway, it's off to the library for me.  I have lots of stuff to do and tons of studying.  Good luck on finals everyone, if you aren't done already.

"event","I'm on Spring Break until this Tuesday.  Classes start on wednesday.  I don't have clinic on that Thursday, but I do have a lovely test that I blocked from my memory for all of break on Wednesday.  In my hardest class.  So I'm kicking my butt now, but oh well.

I haven't done much all break.  I gave Nate a ride home from school and I've seen him almost everyday since St. Patrick's Day.  We only missed Wednesday, because of crazy weather and he's doped up on medication because he managed to tear two tendons in his ankle on St. Patty's Day while running down the sidewalk.  Completely sober.  That's nate for ya :-)  We've had a lot of fun though, despite his little setback ;-)  We mostly stick to activities that don't require a lot of effort, like watching movies and playing Go Fish.  Sounds fun huh?  But really, it has been a great break so far. 

I like coming home and I actually don't mind being here.  It's nice to come home and have a room to yourself even if you have the best roommate ever ;-)  Sometimes, you just need to be alone.  And boy did I need it.  I definitely need my own space.  

I've been riding Ivy (my horse) a lot and we're doing really well.  She was not as crazy as I expected her to be!  I actually had fun and I think she did too!  I also got to have a horseback riding lesson.  The experience is bittersweet though, because it makes me miss riding so much more!!  I'm in an awesome class and we don't take anything seriously.  I think that's the key to life.  Don't take anything too seriously and sometimes forget to act your age.  :-)

Well I guess that's all for now, I may just crack a book for my test, or go shopping again ;-)

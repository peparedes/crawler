"event","Losing this journal had been most troublesome, but it does seem to have this strange knack of returning after some time.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>[A letter: Private to Rinali]&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>Once again, I am terribly sorry for what I did. I would like to thank you for the flower, and if it's not too forward or brash for me to ask this of you even after the kindness you have shown to me earlier, I wonder if you would like to spend a few days with me during the summer.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's perfectly all right with me if you wish not to. <br /><br /><strong>[/Private] </strong>"

"event","<strong>[Private; completely unhackable]&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>This is for the best. I will live forever, and she will grow old and die in 70-80 years. Even though she doesn't seem to mind, or care, she's but a child. I cannot offer her the things she needs. And what kind of life is one that lives mostly in the shadows?&nbsp;<br /><br />Rinali doesn't need this from me.&nbsp;She needs someone who can protect her effectively, someone who can grow old with her without reminding her constantly of her mortality. It will happen eventually. She will come to resent me. Perhaps not now, or even five or ten years from now, but in thirty, fifty years, when everything has diminished and I still remain the same.&nbsp;<br /><br />Mortals thirst for what they cannot have, they pursue immortality as if it's a gift, and not a curse to see your loved ones wither and die away while you're still unchanged, standing still in the shifting sands of time.&nbsp;<br /><br />There is always the choice of turning her, but I will never do this to someone dear to me. She doesn't deserve the curse that comes with such a thing, when everything she cares about dies away, and she has no respite from life itself.&nbsp;Those who live forever are always doomed to be alone, and I do not wish for that fate to come to her. No matter what the affections she has for me, it will never make up for the one thing I would take away from her. The eternal rest of humans. <br /><br />Perhaps this is the best I can do for her.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>[/Private]&nbsp;<br /></strong><br /><font size=""1"">[[Yup, the emoqueen will be in the Slytherin common room, brooding his immortal ass off, so please feel free to come talk to him about anything&nbsp;:D]] </font><br /><br />"

"event","Ergheiz is rather obedient and affectionate for a fruit bat. She also seems to be well-trained as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Many thanks for your gift, Rinali. It was most appreciated.<br /><br /><font size=""1"">[[Mrrr, icon just for you, Jenjen~ &gt;3]] </font>"

"event","I seem to have neglected this journal's existence for quite a few years, I see. The network within such an object is quite astounding, to say the least. <br /><br />It's good to see the school settling down relatively once again after the latest uproar of feline appendages, and I believe now would be the time for me to focus a little more on the upcoming OWLs, as well as other...endeavors.&nbsp;At least the library and the courtyard would be relatively peaceful now. <br /><br /><strong>[Private]&nbsp;<br /><br /></strong>It's about that time now. Feeling the beginnings of such a hunger is still as loathesome as ever, but sating it now would be far better than waiting for it to get a lot worse.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>[/Private] </strong>"

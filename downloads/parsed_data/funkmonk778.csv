My dad goes off on her screaming saying to suck it up and who cares its a stupid decoration!! Then my mom wanted to go out shopping but my dad said that was a stupid idea cause its christmas time and everyones out. Then we were going to go out to dinner but my dad says we spend to much money, wtf!! I'm in such a bad mood! God, I have been working on making this house really pretty all day and all I get to hear about is complaining and it pisses me off!! My dad yells at me everytime I ask a question, he goes,""god damnit no were not made of money"" even if im asking for something else for dinner jesus christ!! I do not feel good.  I have so much christmas shopping to do its not even funny. Nothing really happened today. Brian n justin said they were coming back down, but I doubt it for now..I'm trying to stay in a positive mood, but it's really hard. I'm gunna go. bbml

"event","Good afternoon. Well, today I was going to go to the Christmas workshop thing, but I didn't feel like going. So I just hung out around here and Brian n Justin came down for a little while, which is always fun. Today is pretty much a Christmas day, I'm puttin lights up, decorating the tree and stuff. The real tree is beautiful cause I picked it out, and the little fake tree, I put lights on that one so my house is full of my lovely creations. =D I was supposed to go to Hollie's basketball game, but I can't make it. Sorry hollie..  Well, tonight I think I'm going shopping with Colleen and my mom for my christmas outfits, and maybe out to dinner who knows? I'll be around for quite a while, so if you live near me come on down! bbml

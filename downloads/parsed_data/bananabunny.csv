"event","So in case anyone missed the myspace post I made recently entitled ""a bun in the oven"" I'm here to alert lj. As of this week I'm about 11 weeks pregnant. Mom showed up yesterday after I got off of work to take me shopping for my fat clothes. Sadly I'm already gaining weight which as I was told by doctor folk isn't healthy. Apparently I've gained 12lbs. since before conception which would make it almost a pound a week. Wow. Just a few days before all of this was realized I got hired cashiering at Kroger. I haven't told work about my situation becuase technically I'm still in training. I would rather wait for Kroger to invest time and money in me before I break the news that way they'll be more inclined to keep me. 

Apparently Eric was going to propose to me at my 23rd b-day party. There were about 60 people in attendance, lots of cajun food, and two live bands...it would have been perfect. He even asked my father's blessing the week before and has a ring. We also didn't know I was pregnant at the time, which would have made all of this even more perfect. My dad gave him his blessing with joy, but cautioned him on the timing. He told him that it might be a good idea to wait until we were both more established financially that way we'd have a better chance of starting a life. So he waited. 
Of course I knew about it because I have dumbass friends who can't keep their mouths shut. So I spent the whole night during the party nervous and waiting for ""the moment"", which needless to say, never came....a few days later we found out we were going to be parents. I told him that someone had tried to convince me that he was going to propose( after it didnt happen I assumed the  friend was lieing) and he became outraged. That was when I realized this person/friend wasn't lieing. I was blushing all over, but then quickly realized that he had every right to feel the way he did. I knew it was coming that night...I was expecting it and that's not the way a proposal's supposed to work...at least not the kind I was hoping for. 

So now Eric wants to get married before the baby comes. He also wants us to move out into our own apartment in that time. That gives me seven months to save money, get my divorce from Luke, and to plan a wedding. My idea is to stay here at my dad's. Save money by not having to pay rent, get my divorce under way and then after the baby (when I'm not fat) have a nice handfasting. I'm not so sure about getting it all done in seven months, but we'll have to come to some sort of compromise. 

Anyway, here's to a safe journey, happy hubby, and healthy baby  XOXOXO-Dana"

"event","I almost forgot you existed Lj. Bah... Anyway things are getting better and I'm happy to say so. I realize I haven't been all to faithful with this mode of journaling. Trading one mistress for another I suppose. I can only hope forgiveness will be offered. *sigh* So Eric and I have been dating for almost two months and surprisingly things are going smoothly. I think this is probably the first time I haven't had any legitimate complaints in the relationship department. I'm certainly not used to all the doting and pining. Boyfriends actually bring flowers and teddy bears? For no reason? No way. On top of all of these romantic gestures, and random excursions to cabins in the mountains he's opened my eyes to alot of what being me has been about. With that I attended my first N.A. meeting and picked up my white key tag. Technically I'm an alcoholic, but I going through the N.A. program because drinking hasn't been the only problem for me...only a symptom of my addiction. I've never really been in this place within myself. I've always been the nurterer, provider, mother and now everything's flipped upside down. Now I'm the one in the passenger seat and I'm not paying for dinner. I'm really breathing. What a head rush. Anyway, I quit my job at the preschool with absolutely no regrets or reservations. They weren't doing right by the kids. I've been unemployed but I'm not upset about it. Odd. There are things within that need sorting, and mending. Right now I'm in a good place living with  my father and I have the time to really take care of myself. I'm getting ready to work for Creepers haunted house which I'm absolutely thrilled about, and I'm planning for Mabon and Samhain. Busy bee. 

Well, I guess that's all for now. -Dana"

Well I started dating Eric again toward the end of July and I have to say I'm really happy. Dave and I finally started really talking and managed to grab a slice of closure which is always important. Things have only begun to look up from there. I got some new glasses, so no more duct tape. Made some new friends, very cool. ...Don't really know what else to say...

I really feel like I should be divulging some great epic story since I haven't really been around much. That was thunder just now...maybe I'll wait for another time."

"event","*sigh* Where do I begin? I've got so many thoughts racing around in my head all itching to be set free. I remain perplexed. I suppose I could start off with updates...

As of last Sunday evening Dave and I officially ended our 1yr. and 4 month (two days shy of 5) relationship. 

My bedroom is my own. No one else lives there but me. I feel very strange even saying that out loud and it is taking alot of getting used to. I haven't been single in over three years so I'm feeling a bit like a cripple who suddenly finds himself able to walk. No wheelchair bound person in their right mind who finds the ability to walk has come back to them would just stand up and stand there. I'm pretty sure there would be alot of crying, and cheering, and screaming,and jumping and laughing, and RUNNING! I feel like a wild child. You know how that goes. It's far too easy to go overboard with it. Drown yourself in excess, no matter what the reprocussions. Usually only because this sort of freedom was only a dim dream before, and out of the blue you're not dreaming it, but living it. If I was smart I would probably be taking my time, and cherishing my freedom like a dessert worth savouring. I never claimed to be smart, only clever. So I'm burning my candle at both ends. *phew* It's getting hot in here..."

"event","Memorial day weekend was very relaxed! Dad cooked burgers wrapped in bacon in the smoker along with hot dogs and bratwurst. Dave and I bought a watermelon, but we were so full after dinner that we completely forgot about it. It sounds good to me now! Dave will be moving into his apartment tomorrow night and we are both anxious and excited about the change. I'll be saving money by not driving him back and forth to work everyday and we'll both benifit from the space. My job is still fabulous! I've never had it so good. This saturday is drum cirlce at the Lake Claire community land trust and I'm stoked! I think I want to save up and buy a drum so I can do more then dance around the fire. I don't know much about percussion terminology but there was a particular drum I saw that sould either be played sitting on the ground and held between the knees, or it could be strapped around the hips. It was the same one Brandon Boyd from Incubus is often seen playing. *sigh* I'm loving life right now man, fuckin lovin' it! To top all of this fabulousness off next weekend I'm going up to experience a summer concert and festival called Riverbend. Cheyenne is coming to get me on friday and I'll be spending the whole weekend in blissful vacational serenity surrounded by good music, good friends, and good times. SWEET!
I wish all of you the best...well most of you anyway hehe."

"event","I can't believe my work week is already at it's end. I was just starting to become adjusted to it. Work has been very good as usual and I have no complaints. I suppose there really is a first time for everything. Beltane is fast approaching and I haven't really sat down to brainstorm a ritual yet. I have been spending heaps and heaps of personal time researching everything I could get my hands on for this celebration. Refreshing the memory is always a good thing, especially with a memory like mine. The Wendi Lady and her HusbandCreature have been invited to the evening of merriment, but now I'm all sorts of self conscious. Wendi's counterpart made it very clear that he is ULTRAOLDSCHOOLORTHODOXWICCAN and I wonder if my laid back, intuition based, artsy ritual design will be disconcerting for him. I doubt it, and I'm pretty sure I'm only playing to my insecurities, but still I feel odd. In any case the celebration is slowly but surely coming into full view and I'm getting very excited by the thought! I wish I knew how to belly dance. Something tells me I'm going to want to move the way that indian women of old full of the power of persuasion moved. I can already hear the faerie music brimming in the small wooded spaces of my backyard and on my smoke breaks I have sworn I could feel the eyes of the wood on me. Imagination? Green Man? Or just plain sillyness? I don't think it really matters either way you look at it, because it makes me happy and that's truthfully the bottom line. I found a qoute today from an article on www.witchvox.com about Beltane that touched my heart. 

""We need Beltane, as the Earth needs the sun, for our very spirit cries out for the renewel of summer jubilation"""

"event","I woke up around eleven am and decided to cook breakfast for everyone. I spent some time and it turned out deliciously! We had scrambled cheese eggs, sauteed red potatoes and onions, and blueberry muffins. I also baked cookies with little pink bunny heads in the centers. It wasnt really a breakfast item, but it all worked well in the end. I think we all had a good laugh when my brother Max started putting the cheese eggs on top of his cookies. After that, Dave and Max and I cleaned the house from top to bottom and prepared for my uncles to arrive. Dave and I headed out to the Chattahoochee River park at Collumns drive off of Johnson's Ferry in search of a cemetary my uncle informed me of. He mountain bikes the trails in this park and he told me that up one of the side trails that's mostly hidden is a small family graveyard. I decided today was a good day for an adventure so we grabbed some crayons and some news print. We found the place as overgrown as it was. It had a small rusty iron fence around it and the gate was locked. There was a hole someone had made in the side of the gate so we climbed in to find only two head stones. Now this had to be the most intersting arrangement I had ever seen! One of the stones was an obilisque(sp?) shape and usually with those you'll find a name on the front and nothing more. This one had four names on each of it's four sides. It's called a head stone because your head rests beneathe the stone. So, it appeared to us that there were four people buried in four directions. We had my brother's gps gadget with us and found out that they were actually facing the four cardinal directions. The mother at the north, the father at the south and the children at the east and west. HOW VERY CURIOUS! Back in the 1800's it was customary tradition for all the deceased to be buried facing either the north or the east, and it was usually the east because Christ was supposed to return in the eastern sky. I found it all very strange and mysterious. We got some good rubbings off of the stones and turned back down the trail to go home. At home dad had smoked some fish and potatos and garlic bread. FABULOUS! My uncle Bryan took digital photos of all of my paintings against a black back drop. He's going to mail them to me and help me set up a site so I can really start to get my name out there! 

Now that everyone's gone I have to time to reflect over my wonderful weekend off of work and prepare for tomorrow. I hope everybody had a great day and may the creator spirit, mother father, one in all bless and keep you!"

"event","I feel like ass, and I actually think this is the tail end of the flu/cold/allergy/WHATEVER/ I've been dealing with all week. The cold medicine has been giving me all sorts of wacky dreams, but I am enjoying being knocked out. Tis the beginning of the weekend and a feeling of joy has come over me, but it's not the typical emotion. I keep hearing myself in my head saying ""Nothing in the life means anything at all except true happiness."" I've been on this weird kick where I feel like no matter what I own, or experience it's all meaningless in a comical way, because I can't take any of it with me when I leave this life. 
I spent over three ours today meditating in my front yard and it wasn't really intentional. I originally came out for a smoke and wound up in such awe of the spring day that I HAD to write about it. I know I know...I'm a total hippi, but I just had to. So while sitting there writing about mushy things like pink azaleas and buzzing bees I stopped to listen. I mean really really listen. I found something deeper than a chirp here or there or the creek of a swaying pine. I listened until I heard the low vibration of the planet and her song sounded like a groan in the belly. I suddenly felt my spirit mingling in it's natural place with the elements. I saw my ethereal form flowing round and round in a whirlpool in the sky, full of dancing spirits like me. I instantly felt connected to the ""earth family"" and realized that whether two legged, four, or even no legs, we are all walking this sacred path together. I was SO lost in this strange meditation. When I came to there was this odd glow covering everything and no, it wasn't the pollen. I felt like I had just been gifted with new vision. Thinking about it in retrospect and calling on my love of history this would be called the Shaman's vision, and dance I joined was the sacred dance of the cirlce. This is classic native american spiritualism, but something happened in me today and I just slipped right into this cosmic slot for a moment.

I have been out of work for nearly a year, and all of the sudden here I am. I am contributing to society again, not to mention furthering my own well being and that of my relationship. While I was unemployed I would shirk off the idea of money and complain that it was meaningless, mostly to make myself feel better for being a bum. I know I know this is really cliche, but I feel good about myself and in a way I haven't in a long time. Yeah I feel good for other reasons, and lots of other things make me happy but I'm finally doing something to get my shitty life off of the ground. *sigh*

I wait like the sun
I wait like contemplation
because its all I've got left
the waiting
I wait for the both of you
to wake up
to stand up
to take up your banners and go 
marching forward 
into the belly of the beast
she won't wait the way I will
and when the beast attacks 
you will wish
and hope

you enjoy the thought
the martyr
the wounded hero
the reluctant lover
did you really just wake up to find
me on your mind?
was it that easy to replace years of lost affection?
Where mountains so frozen and barren had stood 
there suddenly was growth?
and life?
and vegetation that even the mountain 
could no longer remember?
it all sounds so fantastic
and dreamed up

"event","I revieced for makeup from Laurie last night, and shook my head as I stated over and over 
""you're spoiling me rotten"". I think she brushed the comment aside in favour of teaching me how to apply some red glitter from Hard Candy. Anyhow, I'm feeling a bit down today. I had to make some decisions that weren't really what I wanted to do, but what I needed to do. I had to be *gasp* an adult! It felt strange and possibly toxic, but only time will tell. *sigh* Well, time to go pick up the boyfriend from work."

"event","It's been awhile since my last post. I was introduced to myspace and quickly formed an addiction, but I haven't determined if it's entirely unhealthy yet. I love the fact that my space gets a theme song of my choice...that's what sold me. Anyhow, I've got a job working with kids at Sunbrooke Academy. I'm with the babies that are just starting to crawl and just getting off of formula. I'm only going for part time right now, but I'm really excited about this opportunity. I want to say thankyou to Strega42 for her post a while back about the prayer for finding your right workplace. I've carried it with me ever since and it really has been wonderful! My dad's best friend Laurie is going to be staying with us for a few weeks. Her husband of ten years is apparently in love with some white trash two bit whore. My dad has been in love with her pretty much as long as they've known eachother. I'm not really sure what's going to happen while she's here, vulnerable and upset. *winks* I just hope no one feels weird afterwards. Anyhow, last week Laurie felt the needed to dote on me which made me feel a little odd because she wanted to do it the way  mom's and
daughters do it. Girly style. My mother wouldn't even let me play with her make up as a kid. She even put a lock on her bedroom door just to make sure I never tried anything. So Laurie, works for Urban Decay and she also sells Hard Candy.(some of the best makeup I've ever gotten my hands on) So she gave me over 500.00$ worth of makeup from both companies. Everything smells and tastes like something you can eat. The foundation is called sugar cookie and it actually smells like sugar cookie dough. Then she decides I need clothes. If you haven't already guessed Laurie's tastes are a bit expensive (urban decay mascara is 17.00) She gave me over 2000.00$ worth in responsible, respectable, professional clothes. I'm talking 100.00$ suede pants, 275.00$ matching jacket, a whole bunch of Ralph Lauren shirts, sweaters, and blouses and much much much more. I've never owned anything that was dry clean only. OMG! So I look fabulous, I smell great and I have a kickass new job. I've got to give thanks! Goddess Bless!"

We had spagetti and the cats are mellow. I still feel odd. 

There's no real way of explaining this without sounding absolutely out of my mind but I feel like I should share this with someone and for the record I am not on drugs. Earlier this evening as Dave was walking out of the bedroom I watched my flip flops fall from a foot above the floor unsupported by anything around them. They were in the middle of the room with nothing beneath or on any side and I thought for a moment that I was suffering from some delusion. Bad spagetti? Stress? Llammas? I yelled for Dave to come back as I began to freak the hell out. I was pointing at the shoes as I explained and he walked over and nudged them with his foot. He invited me out for a smoke suggesting I could use some air.

I'm pagan and I believe in magcik, but anyone who's pagan knows flip flops don't fly. Am I losin' it?"

Propensity for Monogamy:

Your propensity for monogamy is medium.
In general, you prefer to have only one love interest.
But it's hard for you to stay devoted for too long!
There's too much eye candy to keep you from wandering.

Experience Level:

Your experience level is high.
You've loved, lost, and loved again.
You have had a wide range of love experiences.
And when the real thing comes along, you know it!

Dominance:

Your dominance is medium.
You tend to be the one with more power.
You aren't a total control freak in relationships..
But of course you don't mind getting you way!

Cynicism:

Your cynicism is medium.
You'd like to believe in true and everlasting love...
But you've definitely been burned enough to know better.
You're still an optimist, but you also are a realist.

Independence:

Your independence is low.
This doesn't mean you're dependent in relationships..
It does mean that you don't have any problem sharing your life.
In your opinion, the best part of being in love is being together.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/thefivevariablelovetest/"">The Five Variable Love Test</a></div>"

"event","Driving back home from Dave's work today I heard that still small voice that is Goddess within me. She said to me "" Why do you think you've picked so many mothers in your life time?"" The question opened a flood gate of understanding on things I had never really thought of before.

Angela- The woman who led the youth group at my old church
Susan- Lindsey's mom
Mommy- Marisa's mom
Lorie- My dad's best friend

Why was it that I felt so many women were necessary to fill the gap that my mother had created in me? Why was I only now acknowledging that gap? Had I never seen it until this moment?

I sought these women because they posessed qualities that my own mother did not. They provided unbiased opinions, passed no judgement, and gave guidance I had never known. They were all women of power in my life, wise women who seemed gifted to me at the time. The truth is they weren't really gifted at all, but their actions appeared that way in comparison to my own mother. Angela radiated the love of our creator. It simply sang out of every bit of her and you could feel that magnificent love at all times. When she wasn't uplifting  you and encouraging you she was laughing. I knew no matter what faith system I assigned myself to that my creator loved and would always love me because of her. My own mother told me at a very early age that the persuit of anything other than Christ would have me burning in hell and she didn't sugar coat it. Susan was the kind of mom every kid wants. She trusted her children and gave them room for self expression. She allowed her daughter to cook by herself. Now before you do a double take on that sentence let me explain. I always believed I just wasn't responsible enough to be capable of cooking alone at the age of thirteen. I was never allowed in the kitchen for such purposes unless mom was already there. I know it's hard to wrap your brain around but if you can picture my astonishment during a sleepover when Lindsey asked if I was hungry and simply waltzed into the kitchen and began to prepare food. I think I'm beginning to paint a decent picture of how backwards my brain had been trained to operate. Mommy was the epitomy of everything I wanted in a mother. She was honest, willing to grant responsibility, educated, and enduring. I think I was more in love with the idea of a woman like her because the concept of actually having a wise woman like that in my floored me. Not to mention she aided in my long needed spiritual awakening. She took a stray like me in without asking questions and automatically considered me one of the family. I couldn't even hope for that amount of honesty, beauty, and determination to blaze a unique path from my mother. Last but not least comes Lorie. She has known me all of my life and quite honestly is the perfect match for my father. She encourages me. That seems like a short and sweet nothing, but please understand that she wanted to be involved in my life. That still doesnt cut it because it sounds like something any mother would want. My mother didn't let me play in her makeup, or try on her heels. She grounded me at thirteen for shaving my legs. She put a lock on her bedroom door to discourage me from stealing her underwear. I have huge boobs, and have always been at least fifty pounds heavier than my mom how could I possibly wear her underwear? We never went on girly shopping trips, and I was never allowed to speak with my mother about my problems. Lorie simply talks to me, she tells me I'm capable of anything. Today I was making incense and she asked what I was up to. I teared up at the thought of the question. It wasn't rhetorical she really did want to know and when I started explaining she didn't walk away while I was in mid sentence the way my mother always had she actually sat down with me on the floor and started giving me suggestions, and asking to smell all the different things I had made. My heart was so full of gratitude and happiness I cried right then and there. It must have looked so incredibly strange but please understand.


To the still and small voice that has played cosmic mother to me all my life and has brought so many wise women of power into my life I give humble thanks. I love you!

Blodeuwedd, Rhiannon, Cerridwen, Arianrhod, and Branwen...my mothers from the sacred isle how could I ever repay the good you have brought into my soul? 


Whether She be an architype of consciousness
or a living breathing force
Whether She be a friend from a dream
or a deity seated high apon a throne
She is
and always will be
my beating heart

I belong in the service of the queen DH06"

"event","It crossed Dave's mind to act as if we were guests and complain to the Greenhouse apartment's management that Bobby's apartment was unfit for even a brief visit. That way they would be forced to do a walk through and see the number of people crammed like sardines, the roaches, the garbage and everyone would have to leave. This was all in the heat of anger after the meltdown and since our good buddy Kevin was still living there with no hope of escape we decided against it. Well, I guess someone else had the same idea we did. Either that or management just decided on a whim to bust into the apartment. They did bust in, and dictated that everyone had 24 hours to pack up and get out! Incredible!

Please understand that I had my head full of crazy vengeful ideas when we left that place that has been so cleverly termed ""the bowels of hell"". I convinced myself that if I was going to set out to do anything spiritual, or physical I should meditate on it and ask advice of the gods. Ha Ha Ha...Cerridwen was shaking a  finger in my face in that scolding fasion that makes every child feel three inches tall. She just kept saying
""NO! You don't wanna mess with this honey...trust me"" and I kept saying ""but but...please"" hahaha.

So it all works out in the end...hehehe

"event","It feels like centuries since I was scaring the crap out of people at the haunted house for money. It feels like ages since I made Misa laugh or since I saw my whole family sitting at the same dinner table. The past year was a tumultuous one and I'm just starting to see the clouds break. I'm finally starting to see the first little rays of sunshine. 

No more Luke
No more being a nomad
No more worrying 
No more ""recovery""

Dave pointed out to me that my life had been ""in shift"" for the entirity of 2005. For some reason hearing him say that made me burst into tears. I understand my emotions pretty well, and tend to be a very anylitical person when it comes to me. Somehow I completely missed that. How could I? It wasn't hormones, it wasn't depression, it wasn't the loss of my husband, or my entire life going into upheaval... I was knee deep in shift. *sigh* I suppose my higher self saw the need that I didn't and switched gears on me. I was completely broken out of my complacency and had a cosmic mirror shoved in my face.

Today I undserstand why acid is illegal. Today I understand why my husband felt the need to lie. Today I understand why I was always so afraid to ""get a life"". Today is the day..."

"event","I have tried to post this entry at least three times. Unfortunately the lap top I'm using is really tempermental and one slip on the keyboard when trying to back space sends me four pages back with no hope of return. Grr...

Anyway, I was just going to record that Imbolg went really well. Everyone enjoyed themselves and we were able to perform the celebration without getting rained out. Not that rain would have been a bad thing, but cold and rain is a bad thing. We had a great time and everyone is already reporting positive changes. Hooray!   

Dave and I are doing well here at Dads. Now that mom has moved out the atmosphere in the house has completely changed. Everyone is much calmer and no one feels like they are walking on egg shells. She stops by every now and again but only manages to complain about the way the house looks, or to try and talk bad about my father. She leaves when she realizes that she really can't force me to choose sides. It's very sad that something like this has continued unsuccesfully for years and yet she just keeps trying to win me over by telling me horrible things about my family and the way she's being treated. It's kind of crazy to think someone you lived with would tried to convince you that events in the past happened differently than you and everyone else in your family remembers. It's sick that someone you loved and lived with would try to convince you that  your father was no good simply because she felt it was so. No proof...none at all. I love my mom...but she's crazy. Some days she seems like she has been in her right frame of mind her whole life and then quite literally she'll just change her mood and she seems to have no idea she's done it at all........*sigh*


Anyway....that's enough for now. Time for a smoke.

"event","I talked to dad the other day about allowing me to host circle at the house. He said as long as there were no animal sacrifices he was alright with the idea. I am heartbroken...jk. Anyway, Dave and I spent all day today cleaning the house, and creating a new fire pit for the back yard. I just finished adding the last of the rocks or should I say boulders in place around the fire. I raked a huge circle and  path leading to it, and Dave decided he couldn't wait until tomorrow night so he and Max are out in the back yard right now being manly men around a roaring fire. Mom called today to ask what I had been up to. I sort of blurted out the whole Imbolg thing and she seemed confused. "" So you're throwing away Christianity in favour of being a pagan?"" I realized that all this time she had been  playing a game of denial. I had told her about my beliefs several times in the past, but I suppose it was just easier for her to pretend she didn't know. So I made it perfectly clear this time around. No beating around the bush! I even mentioned that I was recently ordained. I'm not sure how she feels, but I am good on my end. I have said my peace, and I have been honest. 

So tomorrow night the girls will arrive and we'll dance and make merry just like good pagans should. WOOHOO!

Ladies and gentlemen thankyou so very much for coming out and spending a little time on this page. We have a wonderful show prepared for all of you and I know at this point you are all on the edges of your seats and I won't keep you waiting...

Welcome to THE WILD RIDE

Also appearing: The cliche stoner sleeping on the couch.(Applause), and Pyro the contemplative.(applause)


It was probably about ten pm when the drugs took over, but that's not really important. There were a few uncomfortable glances around the room. We knew, but were the other roomies aware of our state? I don't beleive I said anything, but I was reminded that I had been talking in circles beginning and ending my conversations all on the same statement.  I looked around the room the survey the status of the three amigos, and found that everyone of those bastards was wearing a hat. Had they left me out of the hat loop on purpose? No one spoke, and my eyes scanned the perimiter of the room for something to put on top of my head. The pressure to fit in was consuming me and I felt I might explode into tears if I didnt' have something. Then suddenly, there it was. The reluctant pink hat sitting on top of an old bed post. It's tiny hairs seemed to wave and beckon me over. Soon enough I was part of the happy hat club and we all sat merrily eyeing eachother's cranial adornments. At some point some raving beast of a woman came crawling out the bedroom. I was appauled at the nerve of such a creature. I jumped to my feet and began to shout for her to get back into the cave where she belonged. ""You don't live here!"" I found myself screaming. The overgrown beast started to mumble something about how I was fucking with the trinity, but I couldn't be sure which trinity the garbled monster was referring to. Soon enough the damned thing had slimed it's was back into the cave and things began to calm down again.  At some point later on there came an ungodly howling from the ""cave"". We were all greatly sickened to think such goblins had managed to fuck. The noise was deafening  to our sensitive ears, but I managed to avoid most of while staring at the world through my bunny goggles. That's a side affect of wearing the reluctant pink hat. It gives you wonderfully pink framed bunny vision and for whatever reason it seemed to make the goings on in that apartment palatable. While the demonic orgy raged on we found comfort in talking of a great many things.  Every now and again migrating outside for a bit of fresh air. It seemed twenty conversations were going on without effort. Swapping subject matter the way we swapped out hats and often pausing to watch some pretty flit of color or swirl and returning without skipping a beat. I must have covered everthing from human connection during relationships and how we all lock in together to  the real reasons why we had all gathered in that dingy apartment. At times I felt I was talking to monkeys. You couldn't really blame them, and I didn't really try.  It wasn't really anyone's fault that I had taken a left turn and the rest of them were still headed right. I tried bridging the gap several times, and it seemed the only person in the room on the same page as me was Pyro the contemplative. That didn't last long enough to do either of us any good due the sudden outpouring of the post coital oozing cunt monsters that had somehow managed to escape again. This time they were headed for the door. The inhebriated Bobby followed after hanging his head. It was a damn shame to see someone once so brave now completely locked in between two stagnate alien pussies. I was caught up in a warm rush and electric pain in my kidneys. At first panic came, but eventually there was a realization that I had ingested a considerable amount of drugs and my body was desperately trying to filter them.  I seemed to be having a conversation with my right kidney when it occured to me and the three amigos that all three of the creatures from the cave across the hall were gone. My god! They had escaped and now they were drunk and wreaking havoc on whomever may cross them. This bothered me immensely and I felt the trip slipping into a kind of cosmic rage. I had to stop. So what if they killed people. Then some officer of the law could put them in a real cave and I wouldn't have to ruin my trip by screaming at them.  I tried to sleep when all the cigarettes were gone. I learned as everyone does that sleep will not come to nest in you during a trip. One may acheive a dream like state, but never be fooled. The brain is tricky at this point, and you've got the be twice as sly to out wit yourself.  After an hour of brain wrestling I seattled down a bit, and the room was hushed.  Pyro the contemplative had bowed out not long after the drunken horde, and the three amigos were all lost in slumber. Jude the cliche stoner asleep in the couch would remain as such with the rest of us and I content knowing that everyone and everything was in its place was able to let go and close my eyes. The faeries, and elementals danced all about my head as a drifted away. The alpha male leaned over to ask if I was alright and I think I remember saying:

""Dude you've got to come in here and see this wild ride. I've been on this rollercoaster the whole night and now that everyone's going to sleep I can stop making conversation and ride it without interruption."""

"event","New Year's Eve party went off quite well if I do say so myself. Just a few friends, a handle of Capton and some Grandmarnier to help us along the way. I think part-way through the evening I went through my cell phone list and called everyone in a drunken stupor. I'm not entirely sure who I spoke with, but I'm not really concerned with what anyone thought about the situation. It was a grand event! We don't have tv, so we listened to the ball drop on the radio and danced the night away. Mom has moved out and has taken my youngest brother with her. Luckily for him he's still very much oblivious to the reasons as to why things are falling apart. He's only shown excitement about having a new house and a new school. More power to him. Dave and I spent New Year's day at my uncle Mike's in Smyrna and had a traditional good luck lunch of cabbage, ham, and black eyed peas. Of course we're cajun so the cabbage was spicy as hell and was enjoyed by all present. Good therapy for me as of late has been consistant journaling. I keep my journal everywhere I go and it's keeping me focused on emotions I would otherwise dismiss as indigestion and shove deep down and away. Hooray for consistancy! I just finished my second painting using oils. I almost cried over the damned thing. Apparently oils move and blend the way you'd imagine paint should. I've been painting since age 15 and finally at the age of 22 I'm able to re-create what I see forming in my mind when I stare at a blank canvas and that makes all the difference in the world. I'm still unemployed, but I'm not really looking for one at present. 

I keep zoning out. 

Something in me just wants to write and write. When I put my fingers to these keys complete gibberish comes out. Unintelligable words and senteces form. Odd.

I thought I had so much more to say, but I guess I was wrong.

Dave and I went to see The Chronicles of Narnia and during the preview for the next Pirates of the Carribean movie. I think I held my breath through the whole thing. YAY!


Check out this book: Vibrational Medicine - Gerber
(it throws out the archaic understandings of Newtoning philisophy used in all of today's fields of medicine and tries to introduce the reader to the Einsteinian approach using subtle energy fields)"

"event","My friend Jude has a fabulous office for her massage therapy, with her friend and chiropracter in the office across the lobby. The two of them have asked me to come up with at least ten art peices to decorate their lobby. They have also asked that I put them up for sale. I am just a little overwhelmed but now I know what to ask for for Christmas...art supplies bitches! Last week Jude took me to see her friend Charles. He is a reiki master/ psycic healer and lives down town in an assisted living apartment complex. When I went in for my adjustment it was as if all he needed to do was remind me and reawaken me as to how to heal myself. All of the sudden my hands were buzzing, the lights in the room were flickering wildly and I began singing. He took a few steps back and began to weep. He help me hand when the session ended and asked me to come back anytime I wished, free of charge and then he added something odd... ""Not only do I want you to come back, but I would like to ask you to work on me"" WHAT? I had a reiki master ask me to do energy healing on him?....WTF

"event","Dave and I are spending this holiday of thanks at mom and dad's. Dad is in Baton Rouge with his parents for fishing and bayou fun. I don't know how much fun there will be after the hurricane. Uncle Mike is supposed to be here soon, and my roomate Bobby was also supposed to accompany us but he changed his mind at the last minute. I guess he thought he'd be in the way. Dave got a job just before the black friday madness, but he's used to the rush so I haven't gotten any complaints. Management has decided to keep him after Christmas and we are grateful. 

Mom is in the dining room with a pair of friends and I swear they sound like chickens squaking. They are carrying on the most typical southern conversation in the world. Gossip - drama - ""bless her heart"" - sprinkled with compliments...all over blue tinted glasses of white wine. When they leave mom will come to me and begin to complain about how flakey they are. This is the southern way: Smile when among friends and talk about the day to day pleasantries, and then when everyone is away say what's really on your mind.


List of up and coming life changes:

- Random retail do nothing job (for bills and food)
- Rising Spirit massage therapy school
- Beginning Reiki healing
- Becoming fully self sufficient



I hope everyone has a blessed holiday and understands that leaving the past in the past is one way to have a great day among family and friends. Namaste!"

Everything in my life has changed and I'm not really sure how best to describe it all. Could I say that I have seen the other side? Does that even make sense to most of you? I am reborn and my eyes are open. For the first time in all these years I have a clean and clear pathway. I know exactly what I want and I have the utmost reassurance that it will happen. My thoughts are linear, precise, and machine like. I am both motivated and determined in ways that are not typical of the Dana that you all know. This is the kind of excited anticipation you see in movie montages when things get done at lightning speed. This is truthfully the most exhillirating experience of my young life!


I will begin with fury and tenacity and when I am through we may have to introduce ourselves all over again.

your fictional, plastic alibis

did you ever meet a leech who was good at goodbyes?

When you were down I always picked you up, whoa
why didn't I recognize that everything was never fine?
I'm kicking myself that I shared spit with you, whoa
so fuck yourself and fuck this bleeding heart of mine

Discovering Messiah (fianlly). Practicing with glowstix. Grocerery shopping for fun. Becoming a better paid spook. Putting the past to rest.


All I have left to say is simply this: Picture if you will, a muppet Ozzy singing the song ""Dreamer"" and breaking a hip whilst fraggle like creatures fling themselves through the air to avoid various explosions brought on by the sheer power of metal as a muppet Zak Wylde riffs on his guitar. Its a mental onslaught of muppet metal mayhem!

"event","Tonight was my first night of work at Nightmare Haunted house and Crypts of Terror. It pays minimum wage, but I get to scare the shit out of cretans so it is acceptable. I'm working in what they call the Alien room. Basically I hide in a dark alley type corridor surrounded by alien pods that hang from the ceiling. There's a life sized alien crawling the mesh wire that hangs above me and another one standing in the corner opposite myself. Both are big and slimy and scary, but unfortunately their mechanic's aren't fully functioning yet so they dont move or scream like they should. Luckily for me this adds to the element of surprise and where I'm hiding no one can see me! They leave the Morgue where Dave is playing the demented mortician and turn a corner where an air cannon sounds off as they fight through punching bags. Keep in mind it's pitch black as all of this is happening so they don't know what that machine gun sound is or why they're walking through what feels like hanging bodies. Then they'll turn a sharp corner, if they don't smack into a wall, and head down a seemingly straight hallway with a clearly lit exit sign at it's end. I am completely hidden in darkness and surrounded by aliens. When I hear the air cannon I know they've almost gotten to my section and since no one knows I'm there at all I'm able to simply pop out and scream something rediculous like ""there's no way out!"" I never dreamed I could have so much fun and get paid for it too! I get to wear a floor length full sleeved black robe with a hood. I paint my face from the nose down completely black and I am void of any discernable shape or color. I simply hang in shadow and wait for the next passerby. HAPPINESS!

I discovered the ordeal of human soul's moving through life, and who we are, what we are, where we are etc... It was full blown technicolor and raging speakers. I don't have words for what it really was, but I know that I'll never be the same again. I will never be the same."

Next week she's taking Jason to court for child support and I hope she wrings him dry. Her pagan group held a blessing ceremony for the baby last night and it was a blast. We had red velvet cake and spagetti after ritual! YUMMY GOODNESS! I like them and they like me and for once none of them are psycho...I'm so pleased!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","The street was steeping in steam and cars, and it made for a very mechanical stew but my heart couldn't observe the experience in full. I was miles away from everyone I think, and it was easier to sustain with the help of a bank of memories. It started when Marisa and I got into a conversation about Matt from highschool, and when we got to the bowling alley some old Creed came on the tv's and everything shifted to Chris in Iraq. I'm surprised at how much power I'm still allowing all these memories to hold over me. I think something in me is always craving the feel of nostalgia, but finding a legitimate reason for it all escapes me.

I asked for strength today when I prayed. Maybe to break the chains I still hold myself in, and maybe to cut myself a door to escape from addictions and toxic relationships. Either way something's got to give soon.

It's one of those days where watching the fish in the fish tank makes me want to cry, the street signs all neatly configured make me emotional, and the clouds in the sky just wrench my heart. I truthfully hate feeling this way and my spirit begs for change. I'm torn on the inside because most of me honestly thinks I'm not strong enough to accomplish much of anything. I have momentary lapses where I know beyond the shadow of any doubt that I can do pretty much anything I want to do and that I can accomplish anything someone sets before me. They last no more than a day, and when they're gone so is any hope I had for setting some steady motion and going any higher than I already have.

I'm a defeatist at heart, but I'm also the queen of change...my totem's still a butterfly so maybe if I draw from that medicine and stop seeing it for a pretty bug something will change. Change starts from the inside and works its way out.

"event","My grandmother tried to kill herself last week. And the saint like image of my grandfather forever engraved in my mind is completely rubbed out now. Apparently they've always had ""this"" kind of relationship but no one in the family thought it was a good idea to let any of the us (kids) know. So obviously I've been operating under the assumption that my grandmother was completely nuts and my grandfather had to take care of her every want and need, and keep her out of harms way because she was too imcompetant to take care of herself. It was just another fucking lie, and for what? What makes any of this right? Something is seriously wrong when you'd rather end your life over ending your marriage. *sigh* 


Mom's still threatining dad with divorce, or the equivalent for their relationship since they never remarried and he says no. I kind of laugh at that thought. She just comes up to him with all these complaints and reasons why she's not happy and why he's and ass and he just says no. He apparently feels like when she's unhappy with anything she just changes everything in her life and he's not letting her run off again over trivial arguments. He's refusing to sell the house or move the boys to another school district and I applaud that. For the first time in my life my dad is standing up for the family. According my mom the arguments aren't trivial at all, but of the most serious importance. *rolls eyes* Things couldnt get any better right?

I got a letter in the mail from the collection agency that Luke and I owe money to for the apt. in Canton. Luke told me a few months ago that he sent them a check for a chunk of money, but when I opened the envelope it was still the original cost. Not a dent made in the 2,666.92 to be precise. Thanks.

Max was suspended for the third time for bringing a weapon on campus. He swears he needs protection again wolves and other creatures when he's walking to and from school. Whatever. Since this is his third strike they may not allow him to attend his current highschool anymore....

"event","Yet another slew of dreams I can't figure out and they only leave me with same feelings as before. The same strange out of place feelings. That creeping behind the corner feeling, and knowing I'm not going to like what I see.

 Dreamed I was on the farm in Mississippi and I had to catch Luke cheating all over again. Dreamed I was at some kind of party where Dave Navarro and Carmen Electra wanted me to be their housekeeper but Dave turned out to be inherently evil and picky about how I made meatballs. Dreamed I caught a serial killer and let him get away deliberately and then lied to the cops about his whereabouts.

 Woke up realizing  I was alone and all scrunched up to one side of the bed trying to give a non-existant person room to sleep. Greeted my morning (your afternoon) with watered down strawberry lemonade and a cigarette that tasted less than savory. I should be headed off to my folks for sunday dinner as per mom's request but my head is in a different place. I'm swimming in the past I guess. All these images and  voices swirling around me and my heart still beating....

 I dont ever want to know that pain from that morning. The one where I realized I was truthfully alone in my home. The floor was cold and covered in garbage, and I got up to shut the laundry room door because the cat box smelled so bad I couldnt stand it anymore. I think I may have stumbled around the house for a bit of the morning half dressed and drunk. I know at some point I took every picture I ever had of the two of us and I ripped them to shreds, leaving half faces all over the floor. I'm sure taking a shower crossed my mind but I didnt have the motivation it took to walk from my bedroom to the bathroom so I just gave up. I know the neighbors were knocking, but I ignored all of them. When the rentway people came to get my furniture I hid in the living room not making a sound. I remember hiding by the window hoping I'd see the trucks leave so I could have one more day with couches and lamps. No fuel for the car, no food in the fridge, just me finally passed out again and keeping the tv on static because I couldnt deal with the silence in that apartment.

I could lie and tell everyone I'm over it, but I think its all just now coming to the surface."

"event","I think we're all ultimately after one thing, and I think we're all ultimately good for one thing...not sure what all this means but somewhere in here it makes perfect sense. I was wondering what the rest of you were thinking at this hour. I think I'm more interested in the thoughts of others at this moment than actually posting, but everyone here is already engrossed in conversation and I understand they love it but I am lost. There really isn't anyone I can talk to right at this juncture. This moment...this infinite moment in time and space...I often wonder if this is a common thing to think or feel or if this is just a passing phase of conscience.  I'd like to shut my eyes and search for peace...the kind you find in dreams, but as we all know that isn't permanant and I'd like to find that permanance in something or someone. The funny thing about it all is that I want the permanant moment in the oneness of this time. This milisecond of thought needs accompanimant. Where to find that is the key I guess.....


I've said enough I think. 

Anyone have any interesting thoughts they'd like to share? I dont really care about the topic...just want to know someone elses brain waves are actually running around here and not just stagnating...."

"event","Yes I said Blarfle...becaue it fills my head with images of throwing up and being in total disgust at the lack of interesting things in life all at once. I am sick this week and therefore home bound. I'd like to get my jiggley ass down to Kroger and get an application while I still can, but I'm so stuck here. Half the day I have to spend laying down...it has to do with the medicine...dont ask.

Anyway, I'm making headway on this really aweseome story I've been working on. The only problem is that its all in my head. I can see it all so clearly now, and better than before. I just dont know what I'll be doing with it once its on paper. Knowing me I'll get two or three good reads out of it and then suddenly it will all be horribly wrong. I'll go manic and rip the whole thing to shreds. And in a flurry of paper and blood pressure I'll snap and scream as my knees hit the floor. ""WHY OH WHY...SWEET LORD WHY""

I'ts ok really. I mean everyone goes through this right? I just need some more time I guess. Or maybe I'm keeping it all in my head so that I wont be able to destroy it. Then again I could always set my face on fire. I'd have a badass hair style for about five seconds! It'd never work.





I'm hungry, arg."

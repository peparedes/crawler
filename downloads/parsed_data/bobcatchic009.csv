"event","AHHH! Im so confused, I dont know what to do!
   I found out about the seventh, and Im super pumped about it! Dot asked me the other say if I could pick her up on the way there, and I said yes, but the very next day she has to be back home for her family reunion, and as I was planning to leave from Athens on Saturday, I was not expecting the feeling of being rushed back, and I kindof wanted to follow Kris home, being so close to his birthday and all, see Ptown with him. I talked to Dot about it, and shes not allowed to skip it, and has no other options, so she cant come to the party, adn I feel terrible about it!
   Below I have two options, and I really need your guys help, get back to me!
 My first option was to go down for the party and arrive during the day, see everyones new places, party a little bit, then wake up the next day and drive home with kris for his bday, then on the way home slide by Dots for a visit and see Portsmouth...
              Pros: I think I would save a little more gas in this one rather than two, and I dont know how much I'm gonna need, and the bad part is that this means Dot cant come to the shin dig on the seventh, which is bad news bears...:(

 My second option was to go down during the day for the party, see everyone, party, leave saturday and go home with Dot, go to her family reunion, spend the nite, see Portsmouth that she has talked about all year, and then the next day go to see Kris and spend two days with him, then come home for GOO GOO DOLLS!
         Pros and Cons: The good part is that Dot would be able to come to Athens, and the bad is that I will be spending prolly more on gas, more money than I might have....

Writing it out and reading it, I just realized how aweful it sounds, Im either picking Money over my friend, or Friend over my money...but for some reason I am confused, because Im not trying to be shallow, or sound self centered, but i really dont know if I would have enough gas money to travel 2.5 hours to Athens, and 1.5 hours to Portsmouth, then 2 hours to Columbus and a 1.5 trip home...AHHHHH!
My second option"

"event","So I think I totally forgot about Livejournal since Ive been home, I just went to the site today and had a lot of reading to catch up on, it seems like everyone is having a good summer, great to hear...
   So far I have been hanging out with Claire and the family, my best friend Kate from Colorado came down for a bit, I took a trip to Chicago for my Grandpa's 80th Birthday and I got to see my new baby cousin Alex (boy that is). I also talked to Kris yesterday which was SOOOOO great! I never thought it would be this bad, I miss everyone so much, but I miss the idea of just walking down the hall and laying on his chest and listening to his heart beat, I sound sooo MUSHY! Sorry, but I cant help it, Im in LOVE and I cant wait till he comes home on Saturday, I get to see him soon! But overall, that pretty much sums my summer up so far...
    I have been working at the bowling alley about two nights every two weeks, which sucks majorly! I am so poor right now its not even funny, and I dont want to sound like im complaining, but i hate the whole idea of money, i hate banks and overdraws, i hate fees, hate is a very powerful word, maybe the wrath of the word will make my problems go away, eeeeh no. I have applied to like 10 different places, so hopefully its only a matter of time before i get back on my feet, then I can start on my to- do list.
 
THINGS TO DO FOR THE SUMMER
-Visit Kris: Check out Zainsville, see tree house, tour Ptown
-Visit Amy: Go to Magic Mountain, see Ben and Andy
-Visit Dot: Sometime, I need to see what she has been talking about all year
-PKI: Arrange sometime to go to Kings Island with Lisa and Will, Dot wants to go and Amy wants to go to CP, only one problem, I NEED MONEY!
-Visit Athens: Hopefully July 4th weekend, Kris and I want to see Megan, Colleen, Tyler?, and see Ryan and Keith's house! HELLO!
 I have no idea how I will do it all, it would be so much easier if I hadnt spent all my money my parents gave me for college this year, and maybe if I had ever gotten my financial aid money like I was suppose to...oh well *word to the wise:watch money next year

   Oh and for those who did know about my probation this year, I am proud to announce that today i went online to check my grades, 3 A's, 1 B+, and 1 C!!!!!! A 3.2, but whats even more awesome was the little box below that lists Probationary Status, which read....REMOVED.

 Well I thought that would be a great way to sign off for now, right Dot? Hahaha...talk to ya all later!"

"event","Spring quarter has slowly come and gone, this quarter has been great, but very chill compared to the others. Alot of rain, and alot more one on one time with Kris. A few all nighters, and I have gotten to know Colleen, Ryan, Keith, Erick, Megan and Lucas a lot more from our endless conversations in the Mod. I became focused on my studies a lot more by force, having to spend hours in the library, and threatening to be kicked off campus, i think this quarter has really been a test for me, one that I am going to pass. For grades I'm thinking like so:
    Science-B or B+
    UC 112- A
    UC 110- A
    First Aid- A
    Iart 117- B or B+
 I am ecstatic. I dont think I have this high of grades since freshman year of high school. I have always been a C student, average as you would call it. Having close friends by my side, I have never stressed before, but this quarter I felt it, and those closest to me helped by pulling me through it all. I cant thank you enough, and while all of you helped so much, there have been three that have helped me the most and hopefully you know who you are. I would like to say thanks to Liz, she has been one of those three and Im not sure if you realize it or not, taking care of me when I was sick, helping me with issues, and taking me to Walmart, I really have gotten to know you and you mean a lot to me. Im so happy for you to be graduating, and I hope we can still stay close, even if you are on the other side of the world.
    I'm gonna miss True so much, like Colleen said, ""True isnt going to be the place to come anymore"" and while I would like to agree with her, I dont want to accept it. I'm gnna miss everyone so much, the girls from Mod A, I bonded with them over the Commute trip, and them going to Pickering hurts me, even if they never socialize in the Mod, I consider them friends. Brian and Mike I know I will probably never see next year, I love them so much, their so quirky and fun, but being in an apartment off campus, I hope we still stay in contact. Ryan and Keith are leaving to be of campus too, and while I feel I have grown close with Ryan, I feel I found out more about Keith. I can relate to Keith I think, we share somethings, and have had some great talks over the internet, and some awesome experiences, I hope we can stay close. Colleen, you know you are always welcome over at True, Me, Dot, and Tyler will still be here! Come over anytime, we can turn Mod B into the hangout spot! Thank you so much girl for introducing me to people outside True, you have been such a help to me with my major, and I consider you a real role model for a future Special Ed teacher herself, I know you will make a great one. Megan and Erick, I have just gotten to know this quarter, but I feel I have known you both for years. Megan you are so fun! You brighten my day whenever I see you, always happy and alive. And although Erick doesnt read this, I want to write how much Im gonna miss him next year, he is the only one I really will never see, and Im gonna miss his wittiness and sarcastic humor towards everyone.
   This has been a year filled with adventures to the Ridges ( thanks to the core four (Tyler, Kris, and Dot)! We need to make another trip this weekend! Although Tyler never reads this, I thank him for that trip we took in the pouring rain, it was so fun! We have been to Obleness and back again, I have developed crushes, fallen in love, and talked my head off in views and subjects I had never explored before. I had my first pets on my own, and watched them die and slowly stay alive, I explored the world of hookahing, and bought my own, listened to new music and actually learned to enjoy country and some heavy metal, and explored other religions by going to three 180s and wed. night Lutheran outings. I have learned so much, not only in the classroom, but more from the people around me. Thank you all for an awesome freshman year and good luck! Have an awesome summer, looking forward to visiting some over the summer, and God bless! Im no longer a freshman! YAY!"

"event","Alright, so I'm going to update, possibly my last entry of the school year,who knows. Jesse gave me the idea of summarizing my freshman year of college so here goes... I came into college in the fall not knowing anyone but the kids from my high school. I hung out with my best friend for the first couple weeks, but i still remember the first weekend the best, I was homesick, I remember crying myself to sleep. I felt alive, being on my own and being able to make my own decisions, but missed my mother and my little brother Nick so much (not saying i didnt miss everyone else, but for some reason, they stood out the most). I really started cheering up when the first nerf war broke out, ahhh that was fun. 
    I remember trying to protect my Mod with Amy, Ben, and Dot. I remember giving Tyler a hard time for trading on us, little did I know his history with Mod A, and I remember thinking Keith was crazy, but loving his spontaneity, and knowing Kris as that one guy from Mod A who visited Tyler. I think my first words to Kris were... ""Your name is Kris right? I'm sorry I'm getting everyone's names mixed up."" Hahaha, and look at us now.
    Fall quarter I grew really close to Amy, I went home with her, got to know Ben, and realized  that me and Tori were not going to hang out as much as I expected. I was doing new things, and so was she, so I got to know Amy, I was introduced to Dot and Teresa, by playing Egyptian Ratscrew and Dusies, and I thought Broo and Alana were weird because they were odd, kept to themselves, and only talked about last year. At the end of the quarter I noticed that Mod A was the place to be, and started heading over there a lot, just wandering around nto knowing anyone, and then the guys introduced me to Modkey. Modkey was so intense, it was so fun and it truly is the reason behind most of my relationships that were built this year. Modkey was like crack, I was addicted to it, and in a loving, not creepy way, I was addicted to the people who played it. I originally came into the game because of a certain someone that I had a crush on, but slowly ended when I was introduced to the announcer and co-creator of the game, Mr. Kris Dunlap. We grew so close as a floor over that game, I got to know everyone through it, even people outside True, and growing so close so fastt made it so hard to say goodbye at the end of the quarter, what a big break that was! I actually thought about moving into another dorm the first couple of weeks, because True didnt ""go out"" as much as I thought, being substance free and everything, little did I know how much fun the dorm was, I'm glad I didnt make that mistake. I also was loving my single, being able to come as I go whenever I wanted, I signed up for a quad at first, what was I thinking!?
   Winter quarter I grew apart from Amy, not that much, but I was getting tired of her and Ben, I felt like a third wheel. She tried hooking me up with Andy, which I got excited about, but it never worked out, and I reached out to Dot, because well, her door was always open and I had gotten to know her thru Modkey. She helped get me and Kris together, and I really owe her a lot. She has put up with so much shit this year with me, from my mood swings, things going on in our hometowns, and our endless all nighters and hour long conversations. Although sometimes we want kill each other, I consider her one of my best friends, like a sister. Modkey died, which made me sad, but I had my first boyfriend. Probably the best experience all year, I had a boyfriend, I have developed feelings I never thought would come, I found someone that I never thought was real, a person that I can trust with my life. I'm still in awe about the whole situation, and I realize (im using that word alot) that no matter what happens next year, no matter what obstacles are thrown at us, that we will be able to get thru them. Before coming here I had never had that many guy friends, let alone any remote boyfriends, but after this year, that all has changed and I love it.
    Im gonna break this up...."

   So since my last entry I have had a weekend with my mother, won on the OU Price is Right, having a great time at school, and I think I'm doing alright in all of my classes! I think I'm prolly looking at 3 A's, 2 B's? 
   Kris and I had a fight last week, we almost broke up. I never knew things were bothering him, luckily he told me, I was so taken back because I did not expect it. We had a big talk and were good now, but I really wish he would come to me sooner about stuff rather than let it build up inside of him, its not healthy for either of us.
   People are so interesting...as I sit here in Mod A, watching people converse with each other, it makes me look inside their characters. I believe I have always been pretty good at reading people, I am great at guessing people's birth order, whether their they youngest, or the oldest. I believe you can learn a lot about a certain person by what place they are in their family birth order. The reason I am so hyped up on the subject, is to be honest I would like to write a book on the idea one day. I dont know, maybe Im crazy.
   Boy Meets World is one of the most amazing shows ever to grave the television. I am going to go watch it. Bye."

I'm down in the dumps right now and I dont know why, maybe its bc i feel guilty for leaving Kris all alone this weekend? Maybe its been this week (my last entry)? Maybe Im just tired. I skipped my first class today just to sleep, my first class this quarter I skipped, maybe thats why I'm in a funk, idk, all i know is that I am annoyed with people right now. Hopefully when I go away this weekend to Columbus for the Invisible Children I will come back better, the whole idea of raising awareness for these kids from Uganda, Africa makes me feel good. I dont care what other people think, I dont care if anyone supports me, and just bc I am participating in this does not make me a Political Activist. I support the cause and would like to do something about it, people who dont support me obviously dont care at all, we take for granted what we have here in America. Well I have to go pack, thanks for letting me vent."

"event","I am so fuckin pissed right now. I hate people, and I am beginning to get fed up with people in my dorm. Tonight really pushed the limits for me, I have tried to be a nice person, I have tried to see and put up with everyone and their different attitudes, but I'm sorry I have broken. Tonight myself, Eric, and Dot were playin Mario Party, we were playin great untill Ryan came outside of his room with the bright idea to watch Brokeback Mountain. I had no problem with it, I was even thinkin of watchin the movie with them, surprised by their choice of movies considering the guys talkin about watchin it I believe to all be well you know not interested in that stuff, but as long as we finished our game, I was good. So Hartsock, Lucas, Ryan and Adam are all waiting to watch the movie while we finish our game, and they beginning saying shit about the way we are playin, and how stupid the game is, typical remarks from them. 

   I was able to brush it off my shoulders for awhile, tried ignoring them, I expected it from Hartsock, hes a natural jackass, and Adam is a mini Hartsock, but I was surprised by Ryan and Lucas' comments. Many may be surprised that Im coming out right away and using names, but you know what I dont give a fuck, I have never been so pissed off in this dorm before, so I dont care what any of them have to say. Basically they made fun of us as we finished, making fun of the game, and just really treating us with no respect, which is why it pissed me off so much, coming from 4 blockheads who have no room to talk. Hartsock, Ryan, and Adam spend all day playing video games/pc games, i dont give a fuck, and Lucas has even started to play this one game constantly on his DS, and I'm just really sick of them giving me all this crap when they have no room to talk.

   I think the main reasons I became so upset tonight was because I had all four of them together at once, all four of them saying whatever they wanted to us, pushing every one of our buttons as myself, Dot and Eric just tried to finish our game. It bothered Eric, but he can take care of himself I know, and Dot thanked them after we were done with our game so they could watch their movie (WTF! Why the hell did you thank them, they acted like assholes!), but for me, I think the whole reason I got worked up so bad was because I was not expecting it from certain people. Again Hartsock I understand, Adam a little, and even though Lucas hardly spoke (not unusual) the fact that he agreed with them on everything really ticked me off, but the biggest factor was that my own RA was acting like a total jackass. Sure its Ryan, he was joking, which I'm sure all of them were, but it really ticked me off, because I feel that I have stuck up for Ryan and Adam, and even Hartsock all this year and tonite they treated my feelings like shit.

   All year everyone has complained about how Ryan is such a bad RA, but I always defended him (which he was prolly never there to see), making up excuses that he has a busy schedule, that he will get better, and we have always been cool, but tonight I was really dissappointed in how he acted. Threating to unplug our game while were in the middle of it, giving us time limits on our own game? Fuckin go watch the movie in your room and stop thinkin you control everything, half the time your not even here or knows whats going on anyways, so you have no room to talk. I was also upset how Adam didnt back off at all either, Im sure none of them knew how upset I get when I am made fun of, its not that I cant take shit, but when it all builds up and I cant defend myself bc its four against one, I break. The fact that Adam didnt pick up on any of the signs and afterwards when I told him to fuck off and not talk to me, that he was a jackass, he told me to suck it up. Yea ok, I may be overacting, but the conversations weve had, I thought we had a better friendship than that. I have been there for him as he has battled his addiction to video games, told him about Hudson's free help sessions, supported him, and he fuckin treats my feelings like shit.

    Hartsock, Ryan, and Adam are all alike. They are all self- centered, like to make fun of other people, and all jackasses. The reason I'm writing so much is because I am venting, and I apologize to those who read this and answer with a ""whoa!"". I am ticked off, and as I will be able to get over Lucas, because I know he will always go along with what Ryan says in anything, for the other three I am done with them. Untill I gain an apology or I forget it, fuck them all.

Word for the wise and for future reference when I say something like ""Fuck you, or Stop being assholes"", I would stop making fun of me, or else you will be on my shit list. It takes alot to get on there, because as many of you know, I consider myself a friendly person, a forgiving and outgoing person. A people person (i hope i dont sound like im bragging), but when you tick me off like tonight, where I just break down, I write about you."

Ive never really had trouble with parents ever, but ive never been in a relationship so i thought it was a bit more serious that his parents liked me than just a girlfriend's parents, and i think his dog likes me too, which i know was very important to him, YAY! Right now I'm just planning out what I have to do this week, so many things. I have hw building up, an assesment for ADD @ Porter, Midterm evaluations for my probation officer, and my first midterm exam in my hardest class on thursday, this week i mine as well sleep in alden!...but my brother and his girlfriend are coming down this week to visit, so you know what that means, PARTY!

"event","So I thought I would update on whats going on in my life, I have a lot to talk about, and I am wasting my life away right now in Alden Library, so what better thing to do? Well this weekend was so GREAT but was too FAST! It really sucks, I love OU so much but whenever I go home to visit, I dont want to leave! I am so close to my family and I hung out with my best bud Claire all of Saturday, so the combination of both of them made me not want to leave from Cincinnati to drive back to Athens till 10:30 last nite! AH! We finally pulled in @True @about 1 in the morning! So my mom spent the nite on the futon, we stayed up and ate hungry howies, talked and had some alone time, which is always nice, im so close to my mom, like im sure everyone is, but i actually look at my mom as my friend too, I can tell her anything. We didnt get to bed till around 2:30, then got up at 7:30 said goodbye and she dropped me and adam off at our 8am class, shes so cute! We were so tired though, not only did we get any sleep last nite but the nite before easter i stayed up will 4 or 5 am with my parents to do ""bunny duty"". I helped hide the eggs and put the kids baskets together, Im 18 years old, and she still gives me a basket, shes great.
    So on Saturday I hung out with Claire, ate some Skyline, and made Tori's bday shirts, which are sweet! On the front they have the Perkins logo, because Perkins is the place we always go early in the morning when theres nothing to do. They even know me by name there, so I feel pretty cool, I love my Atown! So on the front it has the Perkins logo, and on the back we all put something different on each one. For Claire's it says ""I get the chimis"" (which is what she always orders) mine says ""I get the chocolate chipper sundaes"" ( Mine took the longest) and for Tori's we put "" I MOOCH!"", haha, the joke behind it is that everytime we go, Tori never orders anything, she just mooches or steals from mine and Claire's so we wanted to make fun of her for it, I guess you kindof have to be there or be as silly as we are when the three of us are together. I'm looking forward to summer, the three of us have grown so close, we will have some good times.
  For Easter I went over to my grandparents, they live about 10 mins from my house, its so nice when we all get together. It was my family, my grandparents and their two neighbors (who were gonna spend Easter alone! Im glad they came bc thats just sad!), and my Uncle Bob's family which is my mom's older brother, they have 3 kids, my only cousins on my moms side, Bob, Sarah and Jeff. Bob and Sarah are 23 and 21 and both go to OSU, Bob is by far my favorite cousin, he is so frickin hilarious, well their whole family is, that serious humor, you know? They can make any situation hilarious but keep a totally straight face the entire time. Sarah has always been my big sister, so we are really close, and then Jeff is 16. We came over around 3 and had dinner, stayed till about 8. We have all grown so much, we are all in relationships with someone, all almost in high school or out of, its crazy how time flies. After I got home with a check of 160.00 from my gparents for college this year, i took myself shopping for the spring, Kmart was having an awesome sale, got some things and then got on the road back to Athens, nice ride back except for the fact that my mom got pulled over for the 1st time since 1985, and she hit a possum, hahaha wow, my mother..."

"event","So spring quarter is going great, i have been going to all my classes, turning in all my work, its looking good, just worried about science stil, but my dormates are helping me get through it. Kris and I are getting along well, haha that sounds corny, but seriously I don't think we've ever been better, hes such a great guy. The major reason I'm writing this journal entry in hopes to gain some advice from readers, so here goes. Next year I will be entering my sophmore year of college, and I know I dont have to have the housing things in untill later, but I started thinking of where I want to live next year...
   I originally thought I would stay in True, if Kris becomes a RA, :crosses fingers:, and since Keith and Ryan are moving out, there might even be a chance he could become the RA of True 1st Floor! I love the people so much, but on the other hand, a lot of people are moving out. Then last night I had such an awesome time over @Crawford with Stacey, I got out, and I saw what an actual ""college"" dorm is like, I'm sorry but I love everyone @ True so much, but I would like to go out more than we do now...idk, so here are some pro and cons, help me decide!
TRUE HOUSE:
Pros: Good people; friendly, warm, and up to do random things that are fun and not alcohol related (Modkey, Ridges). Good Studying; True is a studious dorm, I CAN get my work done when I want to. Assurance; I know if I was to come back here next year, I know I could have what room I wanted, and who would be here.
Cons: Basically the bad things about living here next year would be, I would not get to know new people, which I would love to get to more people any day...idk I guess I could venture out.

FRONT FOUR/WHEREVER ELSE?:
Pros: New People; I love getting to know new people, and its not like I would be totally seperated from my True Crew, we could still hang out! Plus I know this is even farther away, but looking down the road for apartments and houses and stuff, I don't think I have found any people that I would love to live with yet, and meeting new people would give me more options to form those bonds. New Atmosphere; I never originally signed up for substance free at the beginning of the year, I have nothing against anyones beliefs, but I don't like staying in every weekend, I like going out, and being here at True I have learned and met new people and new things, but those weekends when I want to go out and have a good time, I feel like I have to ride on the coat tails of my friend Tori and her friends, or people from high school that have been put in those more ""college life"" dorms.
Cons: Basically on this, I dont know what I'm going into, or wo with, which is what i did coming into college but its kindof like I go with the assurance or not at all, you know? Also there are not a lot of singles where I'm looking, I mean I would love to keep my single, I love the privacy and everything, but then again, I guess I could survive with a roomate, but just dont know what to expect...
  Idk I would really appreciate anybody's feedback! Thanks!"

"event","Spring quarter is going great so far, well except for the whole probation thing, but I think I have everything under control. I went ahead and met with the lady I had to by today, in order to ""reinstate"" my prescence at OU, if I don't earn a term GPA of a 2.3 by the end of this quarter, I will be kicked off the campus for a whole year. Which is a little stressful...just a tad. I had to sign a contract, as did both my parents, and there are certain rules I have to follow; go to every class, have conferences with my profs, meet with my PROBATION OFFICER, every week, I feel like I'm a criminal, but in the end, it's all helping me, I know I can do better, I will do better this quarter.
   As for classes so far, I rearranged my schedule, so I am officially taking; UC 110 and 112 (GPA BOOSTERS!), First Aid (enough said, but I need it for my major), Iart 117 (retake, should be easy), and PSC 105 (a science class with dot on color. lights, and sounds...its fun so far!). I'm really only possibly worried about my science class, I was having trouble with the hw already tonight, but I have so many people who are willing to help me out this quarter, that I will make it thru. I already got a handful of hw too, some due Saturday, some due Monday...and guess what!? ITS ALL FINISHED! Thanks to my awesome neighbors tonight, they helped me sit down and do my work, Amy and Ben even explained my science to me four times untill i got it, I'm so lucky to have such good friends, thanks guys!
     I've never been good in school, ever since elementry, and its so frustrating. Usually it takes a lot for me to stress out, but I have a very short fuse when it comes to schoolwork. Having a learning disability, and ADD, I'm never able to focus, comprehend what I am reading, or ever find the right way to study for me, I always forget things I have learned in the past, so I have to be retaught them, I hate being stupid. Especially when I've always been around such intelligent people, everyone on this floor is good at school, or have been in the past, the only people I think I can relate too are Rebecca bc she has a learning disability, and of course Keith bc he has ADHD, but even when I'm around him, the kid has wickapediad so much stuff, I am blown away by how much he can hold in his brain. Everyone on this floor seems to know everything about everything and everyone, which makes me feel dumb when I ask questions and they of course answer them, which I appreciate, but I feel like I'm not on the same level, and thats annoying and frustrating.
   Other than those issues of school, everything is going great, I love it here so much, I love my floor, my dorm, my boyfriend Kris, and my girls...I'm even getting over Broo and how annoying she is. The girls in my hallway and myself have grown so close over the two quarters, and Rebecca has fit in well too. I have learned a lot about each one, sat down and had one on one convos wit each one, and learned a lot about their homes and backgrounds. People are so fascinating, the way we adapt to certain situations, how we are raised, what we believe is wrong or right? I think out of all of them, obviously I have gotten to know Dot the best, I have hung out with her the most, Amy I can go to for advice and homework help, Rebecca I go to to give her support (after our talk today, the girl needs it), Broo I can joke around with ( to a point), and Teresa I think I can relate to the most. Who knows whats in store next year, but I really hope Teresa comes back, that girl cracks me up. I hope I can bond with the girls next year like I did with the ones this year, but I'm not gonna talk about it anymore, I still have a whole quarter ahead of me!"

"event","So the last I talked of was the beginning of my Spring Break, and as I reach the end of this glorious week of doing nothing....I gather mixed feelings.

   I have had such an awesome time! I have hung out with my best buds Claire and Tori so much! I think were getting sick of each other! We just got back from our mini road trip today at like 5, we went to Louisville, Kentucky for the night!? RANDOM! Claire's family lives over there, and her Grandma's house is vacant since she moved to Arizona, but all her stuff was still there, so we spent the nite there. We had dinner at some mexican restraunt On The Border, then we visited her Grandpa. At her gpa's we saw her friend Mitchell again who I hadnt seen since prom, shes known him since they were in diapers, hes so sweet...we hung out with him, had some good times with a pop can, and then we headed back to her gma's. We woke up the next morning at 1pm! We didnt get to go shopping like we planned and instead ate at a Italian restraunt and went home, Tori had to work, bummer, wish we could've stayed longer.

  As for the rest of my break, I shall sum it up...Had a welcome home dinner with the fam, went to the aquarium and had my gpa from chi town come to visit, went to a sublime concert (KICKASS),went to Claire's NO MORE TUMOR PARTY and celebrated her 1 year being CANCER FREE! hung out with Tori and Claire, mini road trip, went bingoing with the gma, tomorrow im going shopping to decorate my room a bit before I leave so its not so plain!, partying all nite tomorrow with my good friends from UC and Wilmington that I havent seen in forever! Saturday I'll prolly go shopping some more, take my brother and sister to Scallywag (lasertag) like I promised, and go out to lunch with two friends from high school that I promised, and spend last minutes with the fam...wow im busy in the next couple days!

  I'm really excited to come back home though, excited for next quarter. i need to do better this quarter, stay focused and remember to take MY MEDS! i love my family so much, and im gonna miss my puppy the most, but they are so loud! I cant do what I want here, at OU i have my freedom! Oh and i can say, im finally getting used to the new house...i guess, i still miss my old house and neighborhood so much, but im doing a lot better in a not depressive way. Peace.

Ps-did anyone hear the new rap by quad five trio about OU!? flippin hilarious, and their form Cincy! WOO HOO!
Pps- GET BETTER KRIS!!!! LOVE YA!!!!!"

"event","Spring Break so far...I slept on the way home, got back into Cincy around 7ish and my mom had a welcome home dinner with my grandparents ready for me. It was nice to see the family, my grandpa from chicago stayed for a couple more days, he took us to the aquarium which was cool, hadnt been there in forever, and we have a really nice one, Nick and Abby loved it. Afterwards we went out for dinner and then came home and I said goodbye to my gpa and went to Claire's party. My best friend Claire was having her No More Tumor Party, celebrating 1 year since her brain cancer from last year, Im so glad shes better, shes so special to me, one of my best friends.
   I found out the other day on facebook that my best friend from second grade, who moved away and I never kept in contact with, goes to OU now. What are the chances!? And whats even weirder, is that Dot introduced me to her again this quarter! For those of you that met Maggie, Dot's art bud, thats my best friend from second grade, WTF!? I messaged her on Facebook about it, but she hasnt gotten back yet, I'll let you know how that goes. I miss OU, I miss my True Crew and I MISS MY KRIS! Im sry, I know its pathetic but my family is driving me nuts already! My new house sucks, everything has been moved in my room, I dont even have a dresser to put my clothes in, I can never go anywhere for piece and quiet, and my mom has already chewed me out for not coming home untill 5 today from Claire's sleepover. I also have been feeling so annoyed lately, with everything and everyone, at the party last night I was havign an awesome time, but right now, I feel down, so depressed like I just need to shoot something...and I dont know why. The kids are watching Hp4 behind me though, so I guess I'll try to chill out.
Oh and I taught Marley how to fetch, and sit! And how to catch her tennis ball in her mouth! Its so cool! She can jump 4 1/2 feet in the air!!!! I love her so much! She is keeping me sane! 
PS-I'm wearing your hoody Kris, thanks for letting me steal it, I'm so glad i came up with your cousin! I <3 YOU SO MUCH!"

And that would have to be the icing on the cake, it was so fun! Maybe because we finally got Dot out, or maybe it was just bc it was the end of the quarter!? Idk, but it was fun...Saturday I slept till 5, which fricked up my whole sleep schedule, i mean i never really have one, its basically sleep alot whenever I get so tired i cant keep my eyes open, i usually either never sleep or sleep too much, which is a side effect of being of my meds, which i have noticed a lot lately. the side effects are biting me in the butt, i cant focus (well duh i guess, i do have add), im always either tired or totally wired (hyper attacks) or im down in the dumps, but the thing that has been bugging me lately is how irritable i am. it seems like for the past week every lil thing that happens that if i dont like it, it bugs me...im usually a person that can deal with a bunch of shit, i wouldent consider myself a short fuse at all, but this week every lil thing...especially with certain people, and i know they will read this so im just gonna say it. i apologize for my bitchiness, im not on my period, im just a pain in the ass right now! im totally going from awesome sam to bitch sam in like a sentence, wtf?
   anyways so its really hot in my room right now, and it was hot in kris' room, i was jsut over there to celebrate our two month anniversary...yea im a dork, hahaha. i dont care, these two months have seemed to have flown by, i mean im loving every minute of it, but i would love to talk more to him about certain things (Colleen knows), just about everything, and i would love to share stuff to him, but im not gonna push the issue, we will do that when the time is right.my hands are starting to hurt, and i smell so im gonna go take a shower...bye! im excited for this week too, im going home, i have nothing to do untill thursday, and no classes! praying for nice weather!"

"event","So here is the other one I promised everyone! Yea I needed a new entry because it's a huge subject! My religion...
  Tonight I went to Teresa's concert, for Annointed Ministries. Although it was THREE HOURS LONG! I enjoyed most of it! It was a look into another religion, but also another culture since me and Colleen were like the only white chicks there...I really liked it though, they were praising to God, and praying, like I would do at mass, only singing and dancing at the same time, it was fun! Teresa is such a talented singer! Along with all the other singers as well, so many college kids involved, and OSU visited as well. Growing up Catholic, being baptized Catholic, and going thru CCD (Sunday school)...it was all I knew. Since coming to OU, I have learned a lot about other religions, that I do not agree with a lot of the rules in Catholicism. I'm afraid if I was to sway away from my religion though that my gradma would flip out. I mean don't get me wrong, I don't consider myself very religious, my family only attends mass on Christmas, Easter, and Ash Wenesday. But my grandma (mom's mom) is hardcore Catholic. If she was to find out that I didnt agree with being a Catholic, she would flip, and then give my mom greif about it, and I dont want to put that on my mom. Im not gonna switch religions, I dont even know what I want to do, this just struck me today after Teresa's concert. So many people are so involved with God, why arent I? Why do I have no desire to be close to him like others?"

"event","Does everyone like the new design!? Thanks Dot! I'm so computer stupid! So its been crazy since last time we talked! Well, not really, idk! Let's see, classes are almost done, so alot of the people on my floor have been stressed out with last min things building up...I'm pretty lucky, the only two exams I actually have are psyc and music, I'm not too worried about music, but psyc...eh. My other two classes, I just have to turn in two papers, which I'm not to worried about, pain in my butt though. 
   Dot finally talked to you know who, which I'm so excited about! I really hope something happens, shes been so good to me this year, and she deserves it! My boyfriend and I are doing fantastic, you know Kris? Hes such a jerk! But I love him! Tonight it took me a half an hour just to get him to say I love you to me! He knew the whole time I wanted him to say it, he just loves irritating me! What a jerk! But I love it! I came back into Dot's room after we just hung out flirting back and forth with each other in the hallway between mods, and just stared into space for like 5mins...Dot asked me if I was alright, and I just giggled!? Whats wrong with me, when I was staring off into space, I just thought of him! Hes so cute! He makes me smile so much! And although he bugs me so much, because hes so STUBBORN and so SARCASTIC! I love it so much! I think he feels the same way about me, I know he does, gosh...I love him! 
   But enough about that lovey dovey crud, I gave up cussing, biting me nails, and limiting myself to one pop a day (except on weekends)...broken all but one so far. Ugh! I have no will power! I'm gonna keep trying though, I won't give up!
 Getting too long for everyone...I'm gonna make another."

"event","So I have been majorly hyper the past couple of days...and i dont know why. This huge amount of energy just overcomes me at random times during the day, then i crash, its not caffeine, bc im limiting myself to one mountain dew a day, and nothing else, i have been barely eating too. wtf mate? i dont have a problem with it, untill i feel like i have to lash out on something...its like i can't control it. I havent taken my medicane in three weeks, i think this is the after math, which would explain the mix type of both add and adHD that I was diagnosed with. Im totally hyped up for nothing, its giving me headaches, maybe its bc im stressed out? i have no idea, im not that stressed, just about psyc, and english really. Tomorrow I'll start taking my meds again, these hyper episodes need to stop, I thought for sure I had out grown them, but my mommy isnt here anymore making sure i take my meds...it sounds sad i know, but at home i had routine, which is something i need being so unorganized, but i just get so distracted i never made one for myself, maybe thats why im not getting enough study time in for psyc...ugh it never ends. So I realize my problem, and I'll try to fix it. The past couple days have been alright, I haven't spent a lot of time with Kris, hes been sick, and it makes me sad, I miss him, he makes me all girly inside. Did my schedule...3classes with Dot and one with Kris and the girls from Mod A, always sweet! Tori wants me to go home this weekend with her, dont know if i will or not, I miss my Claire Bear though! Well I'm gonna try to go calm down now, HAPPY VALENTINES DAY EVERYONE!"

I havent updated in a long time, so i thought i would. things are going great, been going to class, i got a C on my last psyc test which i wasnt too excited about, but its better than my F from before so im happy! im climbing that ladder to greatness! hopefully. Kris and i are doing fantastic, we have talked about so much, i feel so comfortable with him now, which is one of the main things i was lookin for. I love him so much, he is so cute, so caring, hes a great guy. Valentines day was so awesome, it seemed like a regular day untill i came back from work at 6, me and kris went out to dinner, well at nelson dining hall, but it was just the two of us, which was weird at first, but nice. i love spending time with him. we hung out into the night and then he surprised me with his presents he had gotten me. he had it all set up on the seat in the mod, a teddy bear holding a balloon that said i love you, candy hearts, in a box like from a chinese restraunt, a rose that will never die, one of the sweetest cards ever and myfavorite, a picture frame that said i love you, with a picture of the two of us in it. He went all out, i love him so much, sry did i mention that already? I felt bad, i got him a huge card with hersheys kisses all over it, and a giant bear to snuggle with that said i love you. I felt it wasnt enough, he had spoiled me so bad. Im thinking about surprising him with stuff later on though, maybe this week, and i know hes gonna read this but i dont care! ha! mom and dad came down today for parents weekend, it was fun, but they couldent spend the night bc of my siblings, stupid brothers and sisters, ok not fair, it was jsut abby. shes so annoying, she picked fights tonight, so my parents had to run home, oh well. they took me out to stephens, a really nice restraunt, it was sweet, i had swordfish which i had never tried before, it  was alright, so much though. I had it packed up, but then conviently left it in the car...whoops! well ive noticed ive worte a lot, but ill keep going. i went ghost hunting last night with keith, brian, tyler and kris, it was awesome. first we went to simms cementary. kindof dissapointing, we dont know if we ever really found it, i think the drive out there was more fun then the actual cementary. after that we went to the ridges and explored one of the trails up by the tb ward. i was immediately freaked out up there, and i havent the slightest idea why, i have been up there so many times before. i dont know if kris was just supporting my feelings, or if he really felt something, but he helped me through it, well kindof. he said that he sensed a present following us on the trail, just curious, good not bad. but still the whole idea if there was a spirit following us, gave me the heebie jeebies...NEW SUBJECT! i have a review on a band i should be writing, but i dont think im going to, im tired, goodnight!"

Dots being really worrying me a lot lately, and i know shes gonna read this, but i dont care...shes been really down in the dumps, i just read her latest entry and she has a lot on her mind... now I dont want you to tak this the wrong way D, but Im gonna be honest...I love this girl to death, coming to OU she and I have grown a great friendship, although she certianly has gotten on my nerves quite a bit, as im sure I have for her, shes a great girl to talk to, but I really dont know what to tell her. Shes so negative to herself, always complaining about stuff, putting down the mood, which im not trying to be mean D, but why I say that is to say that your not helping yourself get any happier if your constantly complaining and being so negative to yourself. I know theres a lot on her mind, I've been through a lot about what shes tlaking about, but then some i havent, and all i can really say to you girl is that you need to find something to get your mind off stuff, something that you can do everyday to release your thoughts adn worries, bc if your having panic attacks, we need to think up something fast... but your only a couple feet away so we can talk about this later, ok!? Next subject which has come recently is the little drama fiasco that I got into tonight with my best friend since 4th grade. I'm really tired of this stuff, I understand wheres shes coming from, but I hate drama and dont have the patience to deal with it. My friend lives out in Colorado, i recently visited her over break, which was great, i got to meet her whole life and the people and important things in it, which was really great since i hadnt been there in years, it was i think a rejuvinating mark for our relationship. I made a promise to her that I would call her more often, and try to kep in touch, which I havent at all since I came back to school. I did not do this in any way to hurt her, or that Ive forgotten her, theres just so much going on in my life right now! Im in my first ever relationship, schoolwork is piling up, im working, and im living in the moment, trying to keep at it, and tonight she bitched me out on myspace telling me how ive forgotten about her, that i dont care about her or our friendship. I will admit, I havent called her, i havent emailed her, and i havent thought about her at all, and im nto trying to sound mean here and like i dont care about her, i just havent!? i dont know why, im just in the moment and dont think! i guess that makes me the worst friend in the world right? and i actually feel really bad, that I am, and im sry. but this whole drama shes causing over it is bringing me down and i cant have it. I apologized to her, trying to explain my situation, but i dont think she understands...in CO she is working part time, trying to get into the studio to create music, socializing, playing gigs and snowboarding...it sounds like a lot but i think she has a lot of time on her hands which is why shes thinking so much about this. alot of her friend have gone off to college this year, while she stayed at home to pursue her music, shes very talented and will go somewhere, but right now i think shes stuck in a rut and missing her friends that have moved on dearly, and im the only real friend that she has had for so long that she can bitch to about. and ive listened, ive supported her decisions on everything 110%, but right now the pressure she is putting on me to call her, call her, call her or shes gonna get mad, or the ""you dont care about me, you dont love me"" stress i feel, is the last thing i need on my mind. im overwhelemed with stuff right now, and the person thats helping me stay happy is Kris...he makes me laugh, we joke, we snuggle, i love it. And if Kate cant understand where im coming from, what im going thru, and that im sorry but i really cant call you as much as yuo want me too, then i dont need this and maybe we should take a break or end this whole thing. Yea sure Sam, you cant take an hour outta your day to talk to her? I could, but this whole shit shes giving me, and the same record of emotions and stress shes made me listen to over and over, i cant do it. I dont want to do it.
ANYWAYS! happier note...im tired, its 7:03am and i would like to get some sleep before my wake up at 12pm...so goodnight all, thanks for reading!"

Kris and I are doing great, we broke that first kiss barrier and other things, and we are starting to feel really comfortable with each other, well we do feel comfortable with each other, which is great. I'm falling for him, so hard and I've never felt this way before, its so chick flick movie like, haha. Although I dont know why, but I still feel weird showing my feelings to him in public, mainly around our friends... in the beginning a girl on my floor, who i shouldent even care about (broo, those in true) said that dating a person on your floor is like dating your brother/sister, and i didnt believe her. I certainly dont think of Kris that way, I really like him, and am loving our time together but I always feel weird around the other people on our floor, worried their talking about the two of us and such, which i know is stupid right? who gives a crap what they think, Kris said the same thing to me, and I know, its just is bugging me, i will get over it though, i dont care what they think, im loving every minute of our time...and if i can get over my foot phobia (haha) then this should be a piece of cake! Ive been so busy lately, well this whole quarter has been, working on schoolwork, or trying to since i was placed on academic probation, a lil scared but im not as worse as others, so i feel good about that, but the fact that im hiding the whole thing from my parents right now is bugging me. Everything is going great at home, my mom just got a new job at a daycare center, 1-7pm Mondays-Fridays, she says the pay isnt that good, and its a lil overwhelming working with kids younger than 3years old, but its great for her. Its the only job she really wanted out of the ones she applied to, and im so happy that she found something that she loved, and its good to be getting some more money into the family, bc as long as i can remember weve always been short on cash...my dad only working bc my mom always had a kid to take care of at home, my dad being a teacher and having our family that kept growing never helped. It made me decide that growing up, I want like 2 or 3 kids, max! I love coming from a big family though, im so excited for all of my siblings to come up next weekend, although i hope they are staying at a hotel, bc tonight i was invited to a party that i would really like to go too..but if not i will certainly stay with my sibs i love them to death. We sold our old house! I was so happy for my parents that I cried! Its so great that the pressure my parents were feeling is gone, but really sad that the house I grew up in is gone...there were a lot of memories in that house and I still am bitter about the whole moving thing. I will never say anything to my family though, bc i know how much my mom wanted this, but I dont like the new house at all, no room for anything.

Tonight we talked for an hour and a half, about anything on our minds, we joked about stuff and had deep opinions about others. To me, a guy that I can talk to for hours, and not feel uncomfortable is a HUGE plus! I feel comfortable around him, I still feel like our relationship is like were in fourth grade, just because both of us haven't had much experience, its so funny and cute, its what makes us perfect for one another! Hes so sweet, and I can't wait to see where it goes, tonight we officially decided that we were ""going out"", ""going steady"", whatever we call it now, haha! I have a boyfriend! I've never felt this way before, originally I thought I would be scared, but I'm feeling the exact opposite, I feel alive, I feel happy, I think I'm in love. It sounds weird to say it so soon, I don't want to jump the gun, or rush things, but I definately have butterflies in the stomach!

"event","OMG! It happened, it finally happened! Last night, at like 2 in the morning Kris and I told each other that we had feelings for each other! I can't believe it! I have never been in a situation like this before, I have never felt this way before, and its so exciting! Hes so sweet, and I'm so glad we finally came out with it! What happened was basically he had read my journal entry last ngiht, which was a anomous (cant spell) reply to his entry that night, he imed me and admitted to it, my heart was racing...I'm so excited, I could scream, but I don't want to over do it, it is only the first day. Tonight we hung out the whole night, it was so nice, I sat in his room with him and just talked for almost an hour, we went to Walmart together and talked more in the hall, in the mod, and totally flirted. I love flirting with him, hes so cute, I just hope I'm not making anyone else in the room like all of our other friends on our floor feel awkward. I don't want my true crew to feel weird about me and kris now that we have feelings for each other, I know none of them will ever admit it, because they are all really nice people, so sweet, I love living here, I love OU, I'm loving life right now. I don't think I could be any happier! I understand though that he just came out of a bad relationship, his first and only, he hasn't told me the details, which he doesnt have to, its his buisness, but if he needs/wants to talk about it, I'm always here. Basically the relationship ended terribly is what I'm guessing and now he hates her, he doesnt want that to happen to us, I understand that, its a nice gesture. I hope he knows though, or will learn, I may have never been in a relationship before, but I don't think I am the kind of person that can just stop being friends with someone over a fight, or breakup. I'm sure it's more serious than that, but I can like Kris as a friend or as a boyfriend, whatever he feels comfortable with. Although I would love for us to get closer, it may only be the first day, but it was so nice tonight, as we sat in the back of Keith's car coming back from Wallie World, Dot and Keith talking up front, we had no idea about what, I just rested my head on his shoulders, just for a short time, but when i did, he rested his head on mine. I loved it, I dont know but I think I am turning into a girly girl, because I'm going crazy over this guy, and he smells good! BIG PLUS!"

"event","So I'm not very good @this whole writing everyday thing, but oh man has so much been going on! Its only the 2nd week! I have been having a great time, I'm so glad to be back! Except for the classes part...haha. But on the other hand, my best friend @home is going through a really rough time right now, her parents are getting divorced, she surprised me this weekend by coming up to visit, but we only talked briefly about that matter. I want her to know that I'm here for her when she wants to talk, but I have been SO BUSY! I have class 9-12 everyday except Tuesdays and Fridays, then lunch, then psyc, then work, then dinner and then Ping...AHHH! I'm so tired right now, I'm running myself ragged, but I wanted to write a journal tonight bc its important. I have gotten really close to that special someone lately, and im loving it, I dont know if he likes me, I hope he does, because I have never been in a situation like this before, never had a boyfriend, so I really don't know how to approach this situation. I think I'm totally flirting really bad, but I don't want to make it so obvious that he gets turned off by it? I have no idea, and also I am always around all the guys on my floor, and I don't want to single him out when hes with his friends, and I consider them mine too, but I'm pretty sure everyone knows whats going on. I guess I'll just have to not worry about it, I shoulden't be afraid to show my feelings, I like this guy, I have feelings for him, he may not think it, but I do. I would love to take my first step for this, but I'm not sure because I think he may like someone else, the ball is in his court. If nothing happens, I'm just gonna tell him, if he likes me back we can see what we want to do, if not oh well, I still want to be friends. I know this sounds so much like 4th grade, but I cant control it, I have feelings for this guy, I dont know if he knows but I do, now the next step is how to I go about it???"

"event","So its 3:17 here in Cincinnati, and my winter break is almost done...I've had so many great times these weeks, but I'm ready to go back. I had my wisdom teeth taken out, which sucked. I went to Colorado, I went skiing and spent a whole week with one of my best friends since 4th grade, that was awesome! And since then I've been home, visited Anderson, loved it, got to see everyone and the Special Ed kids, I miss everyone so much. I played Bingo w/ my gma, Tori and Claire, and I won for the first time, EVER! I won 20 bucks, my gma won 30, and Claire won 120 dollars! She won 3 times! So that was all good, then of course came Christmas, which is awesome! I got a digital camera, Roseanne Season 1 nad 2 ( I love it, and I dont know why), Harry Potter Scene It, clothes and other stuff. I got my family stuff too, but the most important thing was that when my mom opened hers it made her cry! Thats what I was going for! It told me that it made her happy and that she loved it! YAY! I went to Midnight Mass w/ my family and Claire joined us too, and we all choked on the incense, but we made it...were only a Christmas and Easter kindof family, no offense God. After Christmas it was my gma's bday, so we had leftovers, its nice to have the same routine every year now, my gparents have lived in Cincinnati now for i think 8years, and its nice not to have to drive up to Chicago anymore, I already do that for tday. After gma's bday I went to a party last night with Claire and Tori, the three of us have been hangin out a lot, I love it, but something is going on between Claire and Tori, like drama between the two of them, I hope they can work it out bc I'm not picking sides between my two best friends. The party was great, I tried out my new camera, and I got from my Secret Santa (aka Tori) a new alarm (i need it!), the Happy Gilmore DVD and a Backstreet Boys DVD, awesome! I'm debating whether or not to return to True on the 1st or 2nd, my Dad can take me back on the 1st, but cant help on the 2nd bc he goes back to school, so for the family to work out better, I prolly will be going back the 1st. I can't wait to go back, I miss everyone so much, and I'm excited to see that special someone, and I believe Dot is the only person who knows who I'm talking about! Dot I cant wait to talk to ya again! So I'm gonna go, I have Bingo tonight, hopefully I get lucky again! And I need to figure out how to load pictures from my camera! Ta ta!"

"event","cool story i stole from Sarah's xanga - www.xanga.com/chunsa_rah


The other day, my nine year old son wanted to know why we were at war. My husband looked at our son and then looked at me.  My husband and I were in the Army during the Gulf War and we would be honored to serve and defend our country again today.  I knew that my husband would give him a good explanation.

My husband thought for a few minutes and then told my son to go stand in our front living room window.  He said ""Son, stand there and tell me what you see?""


 ""I see trees and cars and our neighbor's houses."" He replied.

 ""OK, now I! want you to pretend that our house and our yard is the United
 States of America and you are President Bush.""

 Our son giggled and said, ""OK.""

 ""Now son, I want you to look out the window and pretend that every house
 and yard on this block is a different country"" my husband said.

 ""OK Dad, I'm pretending.""

 ""Now I want you to stand there and look out the window and pretend you see
 Saddam come out of his house with his wife, he has her by the hair and is
hitting her.  You see her bleeding and crying.  He hits her in the face,
 he throws her on the ground, then he starts to kick her to death. Their children
  run out and are afraid to stop him, they are screaming and crying, they are
  watching this but do nothing because they are kids and they are afraid of their
 father.  You see all of this, son.... what do you do?""

 ""Dad?""

 ""What do you do son?""

 ""I'd call the police, Dad.""

 ""OK.  Pretend that the police are the United Nations. They take your call.
 They listen to what you know and saw but they refuse to help. What do you
 do then son?""

 ""Dad.......... but the police are supposed to help!""  My son starts to whine.

 ""They don't want to son, because they say that it is not their place or
 your place to get involved and that you should stay out of it,"" my husband says.

 ""But Dad...he killed her!!"" my son exclaims.

 ""I know he did...but the police tell you to stay out of it.  Now I want
 you to look out that window and pretend you see our neighbor who you're
 pretending is Saddam turn around and do the same thing to his children.""

 ""Daddy...he kills them?""

 ""Yes son, he does. What do you do?""

""Well, if the police don't want to help, I will go and ask my next door
 neighbor to help me stop him."" our son says.

 ""Son, our next door neighbor sees what is happening and refuses to get
 involved as well.  He refuses to open the door and help you stop him,"" my
 husband says.

 ""But Dad, I NEED help!!!  I can't stop him by myself!!""

 ""WHAT DO YOU DO SON?""  Our son starts to cry.

 ""OK, no one wants to help you, the man across the street saw you ask for
 help and saw that no one would help you stop him. He stands taller and
 puffs out his chest.  Guess what he does next son?""

 ""What Daddy?""

""He walks across the street to the old ladies house and breaks down her
 door and drags her out, steals all her stuff and sets her house on fire
 and then...he kills her.  He turns around and sees you standing in the
 window and laughs at you.  WHAT DO YOU DO?""

 ""Daddy...""

""WHAT DO YOU DO?""

 Our son is crying and he looks down and he whispers, ""I'd close the
 blinds, Daddy.""

 My husband looks at our son with tears in his eyes and asks him...""Why?""

 ""Because Daddy.....the police are supposed to help people who need
 them...and they won't help.... You always say that neighbors are supposed
 to HELP neighbors, but they won't help either...they won't help me stop
 him...I'm afraid....I can't do it by myself Daddy.....I can't look out my
 window an d just watch him do all these terrible things and...and.....do
 nothing...so....I'm just going to close the blinds....so I can't see what
 he's doing........and I'm going to pretend that it is not happening.""

 I start to cry.

 My husband looks at our nine year old son standing in the window, looking
 pitiful and ashamed at his answers to my husband's questions and he says...""Son""

 ""Yes, Daddy.""

 ""Open the blinds because that man.... he's at your front door...
 ""WHAT DO YOU DO?""

 My son looks at his father, anger and defiance in his eyes.  He balls up
 his tiny fists and looks his father square in the eyes, without hesitation
 he says: ""I DEFEND MY FAMILY DAD!!  I'M NOT GONNA LET HIM HURT
 MOMMY OR MY SISTER, DAD!!!  I'M GONNA FIGHT HIM, DAD, I'M
 GONNA FIGHT HIM!!!!!""

 I see a tear roll down my husband's cheek and he grabs our son to his
 chest and hugs him tight, and says... ""It's too late to fight him, he's
 too strong and he's already at YOUR front door son.....you should have
 stopped him BEFORE he killed his wife, and his children and the old lady
 across the way.  You have to do what's right, even if you have to do it
 alone, before it's too late."" my husband whispers.

 THAT scenario ! I just gave you is WHY we are at war with Iraq  
 When good men stand by and let evil happen son, THAT is the greatest EVIL of all.
 Our President is doing what is right.  We, as a free nation, must understand
 that this war is a war of humanity.  WE must remove evil men from power so
 that we can continue to live in a free world where we are not afraid to look
 out our window so that my nine year old son won't grow up in a world where
 he feels that if he just ""closes"" that blinds the atrocities in the world won't affect him.

"event","Been awhile since I've updated. Kat said she got tired of reading the old one so yyeeahh. School hasn't changed much since I updated...still prEtttty boring. Have had some fun times with Kat tho! Since I have a short memory and cant remember before last friday, I'll start from there.

Last Friday was  our 1 month anniversary =) we went to see Friday Night Lights. we WERE going to see it with Josh and some of his friends but went to the wrooongg theatre so it ended up jsut being us two ;) was greaaat fun. 

Thenn Sat...boring day. Sunday Kat and I went bowlign with my poppa. He won the 1st game, the 2nd game we all decided to bowl left handed and KAT won -_-. The the last one i won unexpectedly off the last frame =). 

Then wednesday was fun, I went home from school with Kat and we painted a pumpkin : half finger paint, half with a brush. It was to get me and Elise's (Kat's cousin) friend into Fright Fest free Friday. So then that night we went to The Net, all the other sachse losers didn't go so it was juss us. 

Thursday was great fun, went to the garland-sachse game...Well was fun for Kat and I...not so for the football team. WE SCORED TWICE!! ohh yeaAhhh. 

K so theennn (yesterday) Fridayy..FRIGHT FEST! that was awesome. We went with some of Kat's family. The place was EMPTTYYYY, we went on the Titan with hardly a wait, went on the batman - front seat hardly a wait. oh and Texas Giant with little wait. Great fun. And thenn we went in some haunted houses. The first one Elise's friend went with Kat and I, she was grabbing as tight onto Kat's hand as Kat was on mine. Then Kat and I went in two more, one was juss kinda bloody and kinda dumb, the 2nd one Stuido 13 was really good. It was all foggy and strobe lights and people could jump out at you really easy. It was cool. Kat got really scared, especially at thee end when a guy came up to her with a chainsaw. but the BEST scare of the night was Kat's mom...twice. First one was when we had juuust gotten there. We were talkin in kinda  a circle, and a 9 foot cartoon witch came up beside Kat's mom, she saw him outta the corner of her eye and screamed, it was soo funny. Then another time we were walking througha  haunted section and Jean i think it was said, they're following you! and Kat's mom jumped/ran forward with a yelp, was so funny. Then we had the long ride home which Kat drifted between half asleep and asleep. 

Theeeen Today was pretty fun. Soccer game was canceled. TONIGHT was awesomeeee but simple. Kat came over round 5:40 and we watched LOTR Return of the King. That was bout it, twas fun. K so then It's now.

Oh and since this entry is pretty much all about Kat, and you think I'm obsessed with her...so wHAt?!"

"event","It's been a really long time since an update huh? I bet anybody who read this no longer does. Anywayyy... yeah..I'm at Sachse High School now. It's tight. I have a girlfriend named Kat who is aweeeesome. YEAh humm so where to start. Well I'm at Sachse for God. At the time I switched school i was kinda giving God a ""wtf"" face because I was going to Garland...I had a lot of friends there....I knew ONE person at Sachse (Jake) and I just felt like I had a lot of ties to Garland. But he told me (no I didn't hear a booming voice saying GO TO SACHSE...since it wasn't that, it was kinda a leap of faith since i wasn't REALLY sure God was saying to do this) Yeah so here I am at Sachse. If God's only reason for me coming here was to meet Kat, it would all be worth it. It's awesome how it's been what..not even a month, but we are very close. Not only are we close w/ eachother, but we talk to eachother about God a lot so he's involved too! I'm glad he brought me Kat...i was really getting tired. She makes life so much more enjoyable.
This one is typing odd so next post is more"

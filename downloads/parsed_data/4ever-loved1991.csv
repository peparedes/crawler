"event","well last night i was in a car accident. wasn't that bad. didn't do much damage to the car. Did more damage to the other person's car than us. the only thing is that now my neck hurts realy bad. what happened was my mom was in the left turn lane and the intersection of CVS and Food Lion when someone cut off a cop causing another wrek to happen. my mom say A light tunr green thinking it was ours so she presed on the gas and ran right int the driver side of aother car. i was already leaning forward looking at the other wrek that just happend when i noticed we hit a car and was jerked forward and then back. to many people that i know on their way to the art thing last night saw what happend and would not leave me alone about it. everyone id fine though, it was not that big of a deal. i guess thats all that happened so far this week..."

"event","Today i got realy pissed off depressed type thing. i realy like kris, i don't know y i just do, and i get the impressen that he is into amanda. Amanda is like oh guess who text me... Kris, he called earlier this morning. im like idc, shes like yes you do. so now i think that amanda likes him to or just trying to make me jelouse by rubbing it in that he is always contacting her. It took a long time for me to work up the courage to ask him out and it hurt that i never got an answer from him. Atlesast i don't think i got one. amanda has a bf now, but who knows how long that will last. I am going to be realy pissed if amadna and kris go out b/c she goes out with all the guys that i like or tries to. Im the only single person now. all my firends are either hooked up or hooking up. And im getting the feeling that im growing apart from all my friends b/c they don't act like they want to talk to me or anything except for justin and cadi and remington. I jsut want someone that wants to be around me and cared about me. i want some one to hold me and make me feel special. someone to cudle with. why is it so hard to find that kind of person? Well i'm going to quit whining about how my life sux sence no one even goes to my live journal anyways."

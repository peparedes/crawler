hanging up is like sacraficing my heart
the night is starless just like your eyes

please dont leave me on the end of the phone
waiting for your voice to be here again
the way it cracked and cut me

the hair i always pushed out of your face
to show your infinite eyes. you know, they are forever."

<P>It makes me sad. He fell head over hills in love with her. I guess you cant control who your supposed to be with, although i wish it was that way. </P>
<P>I cant stand the thought of turning up with some guy who isnt what ethan is. I could never have a guy who listened to rap or something weird like that or that was one of those hollister conformists. Im not trying to be a rebel, here. All im saying is i dont want myself to be happy if that's who my future is with. Some guy who isnt into the same music. My music..is my life. It truly is. Some people use this as an extreme form of ""i really like music"". When&nbsp; I say it..i mean it with all of my heart. My music is most of what keeps me sane, besides memories of my dad and ethan. But...if it werent for music i wouldnt have made it through the last part of my dad's life and i wouldnt have met ethan. When thoughts of my dads death came to mind..whatd i do? i turned on music or wrote songs! howd i meet mr.ethan? at his band's 1st show! </P>
<P>I guess its weird that i would rather not be happy than be with some guys with weird interests in music, but since music is my life..what do i talk to him about? Who do i go to shows with? What happens when he buys me a kanye west (sp?!) CD? i'll freak out.</P>

"event","<P>spring break. it. was. dumb. gahhhh</P>
<P>last friday((wk ago)) got picked up from skool, headed over to aunts and yeah. We rented like 900 movies, and i only ended up watching 3 of them.<EM> Loser</EM>[alrdy saw it], <EM>crazy/beautiful</EM>[alrdy saw it], and <EM>Supersize Me</EM>[never EVER eating McDonalds again...i didnt rly, neway but yeah. And i havent been eating like nething but fruit and vegetables lately except i had some clams on tuesday]. Kayla and my brother watched<EM> Larry the cable guy</EM>. Yeah, i guess he's funny but he makes fun of queers and he's disguisting. If i wanted to hear what he had to say i would go to the mud bogs or something?[ew] So on saturday we got up and went to the corvette show. Nothing special..nice cars though. I've got some pics but i'll let you guys see those later. On sunday we went to the mall. No hot topic but it's alright..they had an inland ocean and spencers and watnot. &lt;3 Their spencers was h-u-g-e! so it was yummi to hangout there. Some guy sed i had a nice butt? ahah. Yeah he was hawt...lip ring and he had the same <EM>tigers[</EM>shoes<EM>] </EM>that ethan does. Hm...but of course he wasnt as beautiful as my lover&lt;3 hehe. </P>
<P>So we came home, watched those movies i told you about, and i called ethan. The next day i went to my kickass mema's[moms mom] who is totally awesome&lt;3 We just went there and i slept. The next day we went to the mall[different one] i kinda forgot what it was called. [o0ops hehe] and some guy gave me his number and wrote it on the back of a subway business card? hahah. i was like hmmm riiiiiight. He was rly hawt though. He kinda had the same hair as i did but thats okay bc ethan kind of does too. Actually if you, seriously, think about it, mine, ethan and joey's hair are completely different. Just bc we all ""spike"" it in the back..doesnt make it the same. Girls who all have long hair, dont look alike, do they?! no. lol okay..sorry</P>
<P>*back on subject* yeah well neway i didnt keep the number. I decided i didnt need it since i already met my luffer. &lt;3 &lt;3 and i have. so it's okay. I gave the number to Ms.Kayla who's giving it to her boyfriend to call him i guess for idk why? lol. so on wednesday we did some vintage shopping. I only found ONE thing&lt;//3 in 3 diff shops. gRr lyk whoa. neway, we came home and i watched little black book, and garden state. They're both effing adorable. I suggest u go and rent/buy them...NOW. &lt;3 Neway so thursday i basically drove alllllllllllllllllllllll day. ew. Eventually, the driving was worth it bc i got home. HECK YES. </P>
<P>i got to sleep in my own bed&lt;3 yummii it was funnnnn i have a bruise on my head. ow. i miss ethan but i get to seeeee him 2morrow!!&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. yay! mall and movies...2morrow. yeah i think movies. not sure though. Then ethan's coming over&lt;3 *muah*</P>
<P>well im off. Im gunn go watch the stephen king movie, <EM><FONT color=#990000>Rose Red</FONT><FONT color=#000000>.</FONT></EM></P>"

In 1st we had a sub and it was dumb bc i talked to joyce about stuff that made me sad. Idk why it made me sad. In 2nd period we took a test on something i hardly knew about. That sucked...in 3rd nothing rly hpnd. Same with 4th. I tried to call ethan and ryan and then i tried to call nevada cuz i thought she might be in lunch or something. idk..instead i talked to joey about how im albino and wutnot and criticised his eyebrows >.< We went to lunch..when i was in lin hannah told me i had gum in my hair. Yes um things got worse from there. We tried to get it out and that didnt work so i started crying bc i knew who threw it in my hair. I ran to the clinic and they cut my hair...:( u cant tell bc its from the back..god. So i like was crying for like ever. Then we went to 5th period where i found out we might not be going on our 3-4 day trip, the week after spring break.. so god. In 6th period i was so tired but i couldnt fall asleep. I talked to joyce about the subject that made me sad...again. I founc out after 6th, who threw the gum in my hair. Josh Hedgepath. Um he was trying to hit Joey and etc...which doesnt make it okay. NEVADA KNOWS JOSH..PRETTY WELL. Now brendan, james and chelc wanna like eat his face in 1/2. lmao then i got home and my bracelet broke and i was crying like REALLY HARD. it was weird. 

I thought about what my dad would think about someone throwing gum in my hair..it made things worse. And it also made it worse when i got home and found out that ryan and ethan were kinda mad at eachother or something... it was lame. theyre on the fone now, tho so its..okay! <3

Ryan and Ethan being made at eachother makes everything feel weird. Its like theyre a package and if theyre not together as friends..no1 will be friends. idk?

if u laffed at the fact that there was gum in my hair...i would love for you to burn in hell."

<P>Skool was lame. My teachers are too...i guess 6th was okay. Oh and so was 5th. In 5th we had to write notes quickly then we were able to write a letter to someone named Nick, from Ga.

Most ppl would want to do things like meet their favorite movie star or be on TV. Nick's wish is simple and i very much respect him for that. It's not much to ask at all.</P>

I miss my dad.

I get depressed when im around my friends... I just had to get up and walk away this morning at our table...bc i felt sooo sad for no reason. I might take a break from sitting there for awhile.

Tikanne AND sam get to meet polo today. That makes me feel shitty as hell. w.e tho. what am i gunn do? invite myself. idk..i guess her and sam are closer now bc she drives her home everyday. No problem. just weird. 

I feel truly <i>depressed</i> for the 1st time in 2 months. 

Its not anyones fault tho. It usually is. I guess its only mine. I dont know...if its mine or...idk.

im feeling out of sorts. I dont want to feel this way for very long. Im crying for now reason. why tho..."

<P>in 1st period we didnt rly do nething...we did some notes then a few of us headed of to the media center. I was one of them bc i needed to finish&nbsp;my bio HW. </P>
<P>2nd per** we did our projects..on genetic disorders. Joyce did spina bifida and i did hempohilia. my project was fun for some reason. Depressing, i guess. but fun.</P>
<P>in 3rd period we just learned about stuff. ugh.</P>
<P>4th-we started PE in class now. We're doing lame ass stuff about health risks or idk..we're in class on tues and thursdays. He was talking about his cousins being dopers and watnot. I felt bad. hes like the only sucessful one in his family. Or him and his bro. </P>
<P>lunch~we talked about the shape of penises(sp?!wtf. hahahah) they were showing us the shape of their penises with like a necklace. ahhahah fil started it! lmao. i was like mmm yeah my penis is this shape. lmao.</P>
<P>5th period.well we had a sub so basically we sat and talked about nothing. the class was loud. we debated on the case of that woman on the feeding tube. I think they should just keep it removed. Honestly, she's basically already dead. I dont understand what the purpose for her is to be lying in bed...lifeless <STRONG>basically.</STRONG> <FONT size=5>do u agree?</FONT> i mean...im sure even <EM>she </EM>would love to leave this place neway. Its not like the world is all that great of a place besides the few feelings of love, care and fulfillment. Otherwise, the only things happening around us are death,&nbsp;murder, famon and&nbsp;homeless people that people, as long<EM> </EM>as <EM>they </EM>arent the ones suffering, dont even care about. To be blunt, im not sure that the few positive feelings we have on this earth, can help all of the shit going on around us.</P>
<P>in 6th period we started watching rose red. i wanted to watch the rest. not important.</P>
<P>I miss ethan. I feel bad for him. It seems like his mom or dad is always mad. I dont think we're talking tonight bc his mom was mad. that makes me feel sad.</P>
<P>The plans for this weekend and next r pretty okay. This friday is carsens party..dunno if im going and watnot. *hmph*&nbsp; Neway i think im gunn see ethan on saturday. well i HAVE to! *********************************next weekend is battle of the bands at skate station? idk if that means that its all gunn be pretty much sucky or if theyre just holding battle of the bands at a lameass place? I dunno. either way, im going to support brend's band. 3rd def is gunn be there. so is <EM>same difference</EM> but they are lame. ew i definetly could pass up on hearing their scary-ness. Then friday im going to sam's house and back to joey's on saturday with sam. Idk if jose is going next fri.Then its spring break. Its not ethans SB which makes me cry but what can i do, besides nothing?</P>

"event","<P>well okay. who actually reads this? im just wondering what kind of crowd im spilling everything to. That is all.</P>
<P>Last night was FAME. well...the FIRST night of it.. I have to say that i would love to NOT admit i was in it. I mean...things were moderately scurry...not including the random tech screws. Not the people, the machines or w.e? I think that we should have idk...idk wut we should have done. Jolina, krista and jamie&nbsp;came with a few other of their friends. Jo got pics..idk if she put them on her LJ. if she did i'll steal them and put them here :) only if theyre good, of course. So then we had a little party for ms.fawley. I guess it was her birthday or something..idk. I didnt feel good so i just sat with josh, joey and joyce. Joyce has been busy all weekend. I miss my little loveee &lt;3 We got home at 11:00. rebels, right? psh. Then i got on the fone with ethan and joey with zach. I stayed on the fone with my *magnus* for about and hour...well a little over that. **It was awesome. I was overwhelmed with so many feelings when i was with him today. no negative feelings lemme add to that. It's like when we were listening to fall out boy on my couch and just hangin...i wanted to scream bc i felt so taken over by all the feelings for him. Okay u little fuckers, it wasnt hormones. lmao.Idk okay..back on subject.**</P>
<P>This morning, mom woke me and joey&nbsp;up at *hmph* 8:15...i think? yeah. Then i got ready and we left here at like 9:something. We got to the mall at 10 bc...just bc? lol. Yeah so we hungout and zach and sam/carsen showed up eventually. Things were guh reat. lol yeah we just bought some stuff. I got <EM>the academy is...</EM> and <EM>boysnightout</EM> cd's..and another <EM>the used</EM> shirt and one with the epitaph tour adevertised on it bc its sekseh&nbsp;and yeallow.&nbsp;plz...dont hate. lol. So yeah then we (ethan and meee) left at 12:45..kinda.. and went home! when we got home we just sat in eachothers space and listened to music. Thats when i got attacked by the feelings..lol. yes. idk. ive never really <STRONG>ever</STRONG> experienced that before. I guess ive never been in such&nbsp;<EM>infinite</EM> love. k, inside joke. lol. Idk...maybe im being extremely cheesy or maybe im being a normal ""teen grrl"" but idk...i never felt this with mike. I thought that the ""love"" i had for mike could never be greater...<U>especially</U> loving someone else. I love ethan. I love him...and im not being the grrl who loves every guy she comes into contact with. I dont use love unless someone means something to me. He means sooo much to me.. i <STRONG>do</STRONG> <EM>love</EM> <U>him.</U> </P>
<P>oh god..off subject AGAIN. lol</P>
<P>when we got home we stayed for about...hmm...well until like 5. Then tikanne came and got us and we got chinese food. lmao. We were in there and tikannes like ""can we buy some asians?!"" hahaha she didnt say it to the ppl but she had like $4 and shes like yeah. lmao. then the chinese ppl back there were like babysitting or something. lmao. idk he was carrying this baby around in a little...baby carrier? and like liftes him over the hot surfaced oven that those ppl fry on or something? lmao. i was like ""cookin our children like back in our home land."" ew im being really racist. 0_O o0opsies!</P>
<P>so then we got to the skool to get rdy for FAME. ethan hung back stage and got to watch all of the grrls change ;) k not rly. he actually went and sat. he's a very good boy...<STRONG>in front of me</STRONG> ;)</P>
<P>so we got ready and got bitched at for idk wut this time. We're always being bitched at for something...sjkgfhjksdf gross.</P>
<P>on ""carmens"" part where she sings about L.A i got kinda teary. i guess...it was the last night/ tikanne being amazingly beautiful/ her flawless singing or my loveyness for my wifey. Idk either way it was sad. It got me thinking about her leaving for college next yr. Well she'll be in gville...but still. I cant sit with her in the mornings, i cant hug her everyday after 2nd period and i cant see her braces-less smile ;) she has a purrty smile!! &lt;3&lt;3 neway, as i am being a scurry stalker. lmao</P>
<P>so yeah, show over, we sucked...or <EM>atleast</EM> <STRONG>i</STRONG> did. hm. i had to say bye to ethan. this time was abnormally difficult to do it. I miss him already. I missed him...before he left. ^.^ is that weird?</P>
<P>guess so.</P>"

have u ever wondered what clothes <i>are</i>. Well of course we know what they are. But have you ever pondered how different stuff came along. Like...how certain people like the baggy clothes and some dont. Are we all trying to fit in to some sort of scene...or do our minds just choose for us? I mean...you never see a person wearing ecko at a local show. Or a guy with tight pants and jet black hair and eyeliner working in the foot locker. Its like you cant like a certain thing without lookin like the other people who like it. How many people can say that if they saw a person with gold teeth and nike hightops on, walk into hot topic to buy an underOATH shirt, they would think its normal? I guess it just <i>happens</i> that way. Well...like me. I happen to wear the clothes and like the music of what ppl would either call ""emo"" or ""punk""...it just <b>is</b>. Nothing i can do or nothing ive tried to be and sometimes it makes me mad that people call me that... i dont take it offensively or nething. i just get pissy about it.

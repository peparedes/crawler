"event","well, apparently saundra has been spreading shit about me at ""only faggots allowed""... i mean, i TRUSTED her with personal things, and what does she do??? she  tells ppl i dont even know about my personal life. like, she tells heathers cuzins girlfriend stuff ABOUT ME and then she goes and tells heathers cuzin, who inturn tells heather, and it comes back to me. WHAT THE FUCK??? 

also, she told keri that amedee is *hers* and the rest of us should back off.   ok, once again, WHAT THE FUCK??? she has NO RIGHT to tell anyone that. he doesnt even like her as a person, let alone a girlfriend. and, i have her beat to boot about the liking amedee thing. ok, she SO doesnt beat us (dana and i)... saundra has liked him for what? 3 weeks. dana has liked him for 6 months, and i liked him for 2 years. sorry saundra, get better math skills."

u know, if fredie murcury wouldnt have been a gay man... and dead, he would totally be my god :D"

"event","great, so now im sick. just dandy. and saundra might be coming back. tho, idk if its true, i heard it from keri. but if she does come back, i may move away. idt i can handle her on a day to day basis anymore. im just so used to not fighting that im not shure i could do it now.... had an assembly for boces today, and im gonna go look at the allied health program, and the intro to health occupations. i wanted to see the unique occupations thing, but they didnt have a peeky thing into that. i really would like to go into microbiology (possibly marinemicrobiology)... and i think my fall back will be pharmacy. 

no idea why everyone thinks they have to fight with me... im gettin rather sick of it... infact, its really pissing me off. i think ill go listen to some loud music to piss my dad off..."

krystal was at school today. which was cool. we all love her :-D.

"event","i am having the worst 2005 ever (well, i know there hasnt been another one, but that isnt the point) this whole year so far has sucked major ass. my book of shaddows has ""mysteriously"" disappeared (ie: i think my mom took it) so i now have no where to vent untill i buy another notbook. also, i messed things up really really badly between amedee and tab... and i feel horrible about it. i didnt intentionally do it. i know how much they mean to each other, and i would never want to sabotage that. i used to want to over the summer, but... things are different now. cassaundra wasnt very sympthetic...

lets see if i have anything happy to talk about... *thinks*.... well, atleast i know i am a self centered drama queen. hip hip horray for me :-/"

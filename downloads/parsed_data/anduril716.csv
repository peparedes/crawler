<br />to genuinely connect with others, and need to
<br />be appreciated. They do everything with
<br />quality and are devoted and loyal friends and
<br />employers/employees. Whatever or whomever
<br />they commit to are their sole (and soul)
<br />focus. They love to serve and will give
<br />freely of themselves in order to nurture
<br />others lives.

BLUES, however, do need to be understood. They have
<br />distinct preferences and occasionally the
<br />somewhat controlling (but always fair)
<br />personality of a confident leader. Their code
<br />of ethics is remarkably strong and they
<br />expect others to live honest, committed lives
<br />as well. They enjoy sharing meaningful
<br />moments in conversation as well as
<br />remembering special life events (i.e.,
<br />birthdays and anniversaries). BLUES are
<br />dependable, thoughtful, nurturing, and can
<br />also be self-righteous, a bit worry-prone,
<br />and emotionally intense. They are like
<br />sainted pit-bulls who never let go of
<br />something once they are committed. When you
<br />deal with a BLUE, be sincere, make an effort
<br />to truly understand them, and truly
<br />appreciate them.

"event","well, i figured i should finally get around to making a new post, since i'm too lazy to send out a bunch of emails. I guess i'll give you highlights, and lowlights, of what's happened since i got here.

Tuesday and Wednesday - almost cried when i said goodbye to the rents. it was sad, they both almost cried too. flight to germany was... interesting. food was bad. german flight attendants are hard to understand over PAs. it is nearly impossible to sleep on airplanes, even after taking Ambien. Frankfurt Airport sucks ass, as it is also a hospital, and my flight was consequently delayed an hour because someone got airlifted into my gate, which wasn't even a gate. i never saw the helicopter, or anyone remotely associated to flight-for-lifes. we went down a staircase to the tarmac, packed onto a transport, and drove a year and a half to the opposite end of the airport complex to our plane, only to be informed that we were 25th in line for takeoff. 

Once at Heathrow, i wondered where on earth they shot those parts of Love Actually and Bend it Like Beckham, because it was kind of... dingy. waited for a long time in Customs, probably 20 minutes, found the luggage, succeeded in not being searched AT ALL, and met up with Toby. he proceeded to get lost trying to find the way from terminal 3 to terminal 2, while i was dragging my heavy suitcases behind me up ramps. met up with Middlesex welcome folks. waited for 2 1/2 hours for the Greek kid to get in, then gave up on him and ordered a coach. he showed up just as we finished loading in to it. made the first dropoff just fine, then waited 1/2 an hour while the bus driver tried to figure out how to get to the next drop. however, about a mile out, driver used the e-brake while stopped on a hill, and the brake stuck.  one of the student helpers received a call that his cousin had been in an accident and may or may not be dying, so he took off. other student helper freaked out. waited 2 hours for another coach to pick us up in rush hour and watched lee evans  dvd. pretty funny stand up. next bus came, listened to driver make fun of all our accents, which was pretty funny. made all the other drop offs and finally got to my campus, YAY! then the driver unloaded my luggage, only to realize that he had mistakenly unloaded one of my cases at the last stop. they went to get it, and i had something to eat that they had saved for me. all in all, i arrived at Heathrow at 2, and got to campus at 9. promptly went to bed.

Thursday - met up with other girl from CSU, YAY! began meetinig other people in Orientation stuff, and then all hell broke loose. This University is ass-backwards and really confusing. They claim to be internet-oriented, but we definitely didn't see that side. we all got massively confused at what we were supposed to do first because they didn't tell us, so much running back and forth from the library and the registration room happened. Yeesh. Went to Asda with another girl that missed the shopping trip the day before, which was pretty interesting, and bought a cellphone. i do not like Asda (uk walmart-owned store, but not nearly as chock-full of goodies). Took the tube!!! i heart the tube. discovered that i had locked keys in room. met neighbor down the hall named Waquer (wacker), who let me keep groceries in his room while i hunted down the security guard. keys were on bed. waq rocks.

Friday - Forced to more orientation shit at Enfield campus. Blew off as much of it as possible, and instead went to Tesco (safeway-owned store). I heart tesco. went to a pub in Southgate with some of the other girls who are totally sweet and inhaled our first real meal of the trip. Fish and chips are wonderful. so are no taxes and no tips. then went to mini tesco at the end of our road.

Saturday - TOUR OF LONDON!!!!! it was great! went to st. paul's cathedral, the millenium bridge, Westminster abbey, the U.S. embassy, Piccadilly circus, leicester square, covent gardens, big ben and the houses of parliament, the royal opera house, Trafalgar square, the National Gallery, st. james palace, buckingham palace, #10 downing street, the tower bridge, the tower of london, chinatown, and also got lost. it was fantastic. also found a great little hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant with phenomenal pad thai. yuuuuuuummmmmmm. went back via tube during rush hour, which was slightly scary. it takes around 40 minutes, but that's ok. then went to emily's room to make dinner and watch a movie with virginia, then discussed traveling and where we all want to go. woot. then made to go to bed, but went to erica's room instead and hung out for a while. she gave me her spare ethernet cord, so everyone must love erica. and she's a big sweety. got online, chatted with the fam for a while, crashed at 4 and didn't wake up til past noon. neither did anyone else. almost everyone sat around in jammies all day doing nothing except dreading class. finally got dressed, emily and i did a load of laundry together (SO expensive), wandered around campus a bit, discovered the other bar, made dinner, went to mini tesco again, then intended to watch a dvd, but instead talked with a bunch of girls.

yup. there it is. i went to my first seminar this morning, the class should be cake, and now i still have an hour until my next one. i promise i'll start up dating this more often and keep y'all up-to-date with what i'm doing.

cheers!"

"event","hullo! once again, i'm sitting in english renaissance drama, trying to appear as though i'm paying attention, which is so not true. i could care less about what my teacher's blathering on and on about, something about a bawd and a carnival... yeesh. IT'S OFFICiAL! after today, there is only one week left before finals, and judging by how fast this week went, next friday will be here in five minutes, and i'll just be sitting there, completely dumbfounded. hmmmm... oh yes, at this current point in the day, the countdown sits at 11 classes left with creepy, 3 days left of classes at CSU, 7 days including finals, and three more at front range, including the final.  woooooooooooooooow. i find that slightly strange, severely disorienting, but incredibly relieving. it's time for a vacation of decent length for me, with nothing important to do but take the gre and apply to grad school. woot. maybe i'll celebrate by going to see pride & prejudice, i hear it's super good, and i just love the book. um... that's about it, i have nothing else to say right now, so i'll check y'all later!"

HAPPY NOVEMBER ALL!! i have no reason to be happy right now, so i have no idea why i made that so chipper. school's school, so it blows pretty bad, 19 hours is killer, don't ever EVER do it, learn from my stupidity. 
so, i got accepted by csu to have my study abroad application sent with their recommendation... which basically means i've been waiting for a month to hear if i'm going or not, but i still have to get my plane tickets.  does that make sense to anyone? it sure befuddles me. 
anyway, my mind just blanked out, and that's all i have to say for now. bye."

"event","HELLO! 

heeh. just making sure you're awake out there. i'm so proud of myself, i just finished my math homework AGAIN! so forget what i said before, mis broken-up-over-B's-in-summer-school is shotting for a B in math. not like it matters, the GPA won't transfer anyway. classes are fine, believe it or not. the 19 hours isn't what's bugging me at this current point in the semester, it's one of my classmates. he's really driving me up the wall, but i think anyone would be annoyed with someone who purposefully arrranged their schedule so you had three classes together on one fucking day. it's killer. and deny it all you want, but you know it's true, you did it on purpose, and i'm not flattered. oh yeah, everyone thinks he has a thing for me, which i'm tempted to agree with... it's just too bizarre.
  thus, i can't WAIT to get away from here and away from him and to LONDON!!!! i'm still waiting on the letter of recommendation, i'll probably call doc rock about that this weekend, but i finally got my passport!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!so everything is almost all set to go, i need the letter and an official transcript, then i'll fill in my apps with my advisor so i don't mess them up too bad... hehe.
  in other news... um... i have no news besides school news. i have no social life. but i'm oddly ok with that, because i'll have 5 months to be a social butterfly in ENGLAND!!!!!!
  oh yeah. i gotta get a study book for the GRE and take that, and start looking for grad schools, which blows, because i have absolutely no desire to get a master's. but i still don't know what i want to do with life, either. so maybe i'll take myself to a career couselor and see what the hell and anglish degree can get you BESIDES teaching.
  but let's be honest, i'm still holding out hope for finding a tall, dark, handsome man with an accent and hopefully a small fortune across the pond. i'll keep my eyes peeled.

cheers!"

"event","day two of my LAST SEMESTER AT CSU!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! i'm psyched. in a BIG way. classes are actually pretty awesome, not the trainwreck they were last spring with the communist telling us how stupid americans are. i count myself smarter than him, becasue i'm not a communist, so who's the stupid one, the capitalist american or the communist german? hmmmmmmmmmm...
anywho, back to now. five classes in one day kicked my ass, as i'm sure it will three times a week, but my teachers are rad, and i have pals in all my classes, which is just great. great great great! ithink this semester will be pretty sweet, except for the math. i'm fervently hoping for a C. i know i know, miss broken-up-over-4-B's-this-summer wants a C. a C-, even. pleeeeeeeeeeeeeease.
yup. that's all for now, lata!"

ABSOLUTE MANIACAL CHAOS SWIRLING AROUND AND AROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUND... and i fizzle and burn out. poop. but her i am in week #11 of 12, ALMOST DONE!!!! sad thing is, no vacation for me once i finish, the rents are going to FL the day after i finish and returning the day before fall semster starts, and i have to be here at the apartment to let the damn contractor walk through after kevin moves out.
Ah yes, the roomie. it's insane, and i have decided that i will not ever live with a straight guy unless it is the one i am going to marry, because he will, of course, be properly house-trained. so there. i probably won't live with a gay guy either, because they always have new boys around, and who in their right mind wants that constant reminder that they're single, eh? 
oh well. on the happier side of things, the elephants upstairs are moving out on thursday, my FAFSA is turned in, and all i need to do is collect one letter of recommendation from a prof (which could be tricky) and send in my petition to csu to study abroad. after that, i apply to the school and put down a down payment to the trip, and then BOOM! christmas break, moving out, chilling with friends, turning 22, and BON VOYAGE TO ME! 
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH i'm so excited!!!
if only those pesky 19 credits would just complete themselves... or at least the four math ones... and maybe three from the six brit lits... and a shakespeare one..."

1) went on christmas vacation. saw my grandparents, aunts, uncle, and three cousins. it was enough to inspire me to have any guy i sleep with to use a condom BAR NONE and wait until i'm absolutely, POSITIVELY sure that i want to have kids.
2) finals. they blew.  GPA went down 1 point. damn weighted + and -.
3) obsessed with facebook. save me please.
4) Turned 21. had: oatmeal cookie, chocolate cake, liquid cocaine, kamikaze, butter crown, and a margerita, and didn't get sick.  it was a great night.
5) killed the goldfish i had for 4 months. dammit.
6) went to minnesota on a layover. 5 more states to go until a get all 50.
7) went to a kegger in boulder with alex. it kicked ass.
8) got drunk with michelle and james. it too kicked ass.
9) uncle has cancer. not too fun.

more stuff must have happened, but i just don't remember or don't care.  that's all. gotta go do more laundry."

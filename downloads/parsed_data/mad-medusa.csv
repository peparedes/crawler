Yesterday I made Scotch eggs for dinner, no reason it just popped into my head as the thing to do. Today my sister and Danny tell me how he went on facebook asking how to make them (he made it so I can't see his facebook). I wish I didn't know that. It just makes me think of how we still think alike. I love him and fuck life for it."

"event","So stream of thought rants about what's bothering me right now. Sorry for the bitching.

I've mentioned I've been hit on since I became single. I though some light flirting in return might make me feel a little more desirable, now I just feel like a cheep whore. 

Had a dream he had gotten engaged. Muddy day since I woke up. 

I'm sure he's blocked me from seeing anything he does on facebook I noticed when I tried to tell him happy birthday last month but he still has me as a friend. I don't know what to do with stupid social media. I tried maintaining a friendship and he doesn't want it. Should I just unfriend him or would that be too hostile? I still want to be a decent person to him. He's meant way too much in my life to ever treat him rudely on purpose. 

I love him and at the same time I'm so fucking pissed off at him I can hardly breath. What do you do when some one goes from claiming they want to spend the rest of their life with you to brushing you off like filth. Nine fucking years he's been by my side and now I stand alone, still afraid of hurting his feelings yet the last time I saw him I walked away pathetically crying. 

I thought we could be one of those rare couples that breaks up and doesn't necessarily main friends but could treat each other decently in social situations. I've been kind to him and he's the one the broke off an engagement over a fucking text message."

We were having a really good time catching up with people I hadn't hung out with in months then next thing I know Aaron was on the phone with one of them making plans to meet up as well. At first I didn't care, I was a little nervous but I wanted to hang out with my friends. After a while it just started to eat away at me because he walked up and said hi to every one but me. Then he continued to invite every one out to the beach tomorrow right next to me. After about half an hour I ended up saying hi to him, he said hello then promptly turned and walked away. I just started to cry, thank god it was dark and people were drunk. I tried to see if I could brush it off and still have fun but every time I heard or saw him I just started to tear up. I hate that I lost my best friend. More over it kills me that he seems to hate me. The first fucking time in a month I was able to see some of those friends and I couldn't stand being around him enough to enjoy it."

I've come to terms that the ex and I weren't meant to be together in a romantic fashion but I miss my friend. When is it ok to move on, when will it not hurt me to move on let alone hurt him?"

"event","Every time I feel like I'm starting to accept what's happened with some sort of grace something happens to set me back. 

Last night I had a dream that I was trying to be friends with him, hanging out with him in his living room, and mutual friend was there talking about all everything they'd been doing. After a short time of this I was extreamly uncomfortable. The ex did ask the friend to stop and the friend seemed embarrassed that he made me uncomfortable. I can't help but picture it now and it hurts, I can see him sitting on the couch and the friend walking to the kitchen for some water when a girl walks from the ex's room. She seems to recognize me then takes off an over shirt and laughs and throws it at the exs head. She then sits on the arm of the couch and begins to play with his hair. At that point I couldn't take it and just up and left the house heading to my house as fast as I could. When I had started for the door I could hear the ex try to say something but that was it. By the time I hit my car I realized that I hadn't handled the situation in the most mature way. So I turned to walk back to say good bye. As I walked back the front door was open and the ex was on the couch with her on top of him. 

This is when I woke up and that image just won't go away. Fuck my imagination. I want him to move on so I don't ever have to think of something between us ever again, yet at the same time I just don't know how I'll handle him snuggled up to another girl.

Yeah on the other hand at least my subconscious is trying to prepare me for what's to come."

This dominoed into her asking me if I was telling every one that she was seeing him. In a way I feel like I was yet at the same time I told my best friend that I don't think they were seeing each other but that it was possible. All I know is that he doesn't seem to care for me at all and after he gets his organ from my house on Wednesday I don't think I'll see him for a long time and that actually breaks my heart more.

"event","A few things happened today. I was at a bar in town with a good friend of mine when we ran into another friends older brother. This older brother is a little odd, or at least I've always thought he was. I don't know him well and he makes me uncomfortable. He hit on me for about half an hour. It was massively uncomfortable. I didn't know what to do. He would stand closer and find reasons to touch my hand. Fucking weird and wrong, the friend that I went to the bar with was so help, bastard. In some ways it was flattering to actually be hit on but why did it have to be by a person that I find creepy as hell?

Second thing that happened previously mentioned friend told me I was odd because I'm worried about Aaron. Aaron's gone threw a massive change in personality and I'm worried for him. My friend thinks it's odd because Aaron dropped me like a bad habit and I shouldn't be so concerned. I don't know if I'm being weird or normal or fuck all, I just just I want Aaron happy. I'm starting to realize that obviously he's happier with out me and I need to start trying to make myself happy. Suppose that's the third thing that happened today."

It will be the first time since I was 17 that I will be unemployed; consequently, I'm kinda scared. I fear that I won't be able to find work after the training. Most places will not hire you with out 1 year experience and I can't get that experience with out a job, kind of a catch 22. Either way I'll be happy to be done with Paco's.

I actually got a job out in Dixon and was planning to start saving up. You notice everything I have said is in past tense. I'm not moving out. Aaron didn't get a new job in time. I love the job I'm at and I don't want to risk losing it to something unsure. Aaron's currently looking at other places and he will be moving out as well. I don't know what's to come but hey I'm ready for it."

"event","Do you ever stop and think of how society today is slowly deteriorating. We have an abundance of alcoholic, drug-addicted, sexually active teens with a taste for violence. It seems that with every year addictions are reached by younger people. Many people blame parenting, some try to blame the media but in reality I believe it's simply they way we live. Once, there was a time when we simply grew up fast and it was widely accepted. We married young started families and worked constantly, but then we stared the new technological advances. The more education you received the better you could provide for your family. It became taboo to marry young, and to drop out of school; however, these practices still happen every day. Before the major leaps in technology, after the age of 18 a person was expected to grow up for the larger part. College was for the few that could afford it. Many young people simply accepted the hand they were dealt and left for hard labor jobs. To do so now is to condemn,  yourself, or so says society. Even with minimum wage going up it's hard to keep a life that's comfortable. Yes you can aim for some of the back breaking jobs and get paid the extra few bucks, but all of those jobs come with an unspoken expiration date: weather it's because there's a huge turn about or it's wearing on your body you can't do it forever. Therefore we file for financial aid, we avoid making families and try to go to college. This all extends the teenage years. We are no longer considered adults when we hit 18, though that was never a universal it was more accepted. Many kids my age look forward to growing up and getting the chance to live life, and knowing it probably won't happen until we're in our mid twenties at the earliest. We know how hard it is to get along in life with just a high school degree, and many kids refuse to ever think of themselves doing the ""dirty jobs"". Kids in elementary schools are being fed college plans and knowing how long it will take. That's were the mentality of ""live fast die young"" comes in. We know it will take many years to get where we want to be, so why wait. We all know how easy it is to find a buyer for alcohol or to find just about any drug of choice, the second usually being easier. The sex is free and in most cases quite enjoyable so therefore it would be included in the self indulgent teenage years. We turn to drugs, alcohol and sex for our enjoyment, as something to make these seemingly endless years go by faster and act as a better memory. Each year it seems we find these stimulants, these rights of passage at a younger age. With parents usually fighting to make enough money to support a families they often leave the morals to be taught by after school programs, which are usually replaced by one or more of the exciting adventures that these kids could have by themselves. Teachers, for the most part, no longer care, they themselves are constantly fighting just to get by. The mentors of today are seldom trusted for fear that they may be pedophiles. Kids are now expected to find they're own way, losing the chivalry and morals that were taught so avidly before. Violence with no remorse is the following product. I can see that there is so much more than a few factors that contributed to society as we know it. My only question is how can it be reversed, or can it be reversed?"

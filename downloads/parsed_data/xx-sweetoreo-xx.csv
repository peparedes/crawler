I see my birth
I fear my life
For what it's worth
But I have a chance
To make it better
To have a second life
Before my first has begun

Doesn't time fly when lifes not begun
Doesn't time fly when lifes not begun

I work and work
Within my walls
I complain but I built them myself
And I pray for the chance
To seize the chance
A moment to
Make my life better

Doesn't time fly when lifes not begun
Doesn't time fly when lifes not begun

What do I do
But remember you
And what do I see
But what I wanna be
And why I do
What I wanna do
Why can't I see
What I wanna be
Why can't I be
What I want to be

Doesn't time fly when lifes not begun
Doesn't time fly when lifes not begun

What if theres nothing else to come"

they are sub-divided into 4 groups

I guess its hard leaving in canada and i dont know what kind of guy i like. All my friends have guys they like. I like a guy who knows how to speak his mind. PSST... thats really hard. if i find a guy that is funny, smart, and taller than me that would be the day LOL

"event","Running for Co-Prez is really hard work. First of all my vice-principal hates me and ok i might be over reacting, but catching her ripping down my posters that PROVES she hates me. its cool going to an arts school and making your voice heard is soo CHILL. 
MEMO( some of my ideas)
- get the guys bathroom cleaned, its dirty and i know
- making lates in the morning justified
- picnic tables outside(i hate it when shit gets on my ass)
- days in the weightlifting room for female only
- a school dance but with different schools to

I think i would be a great Co-Prez!

Vote Rima for Co-PRez!"

"event","Im the kind of person that hold my feelings back, so if im mad at someone, that someone would not know. Over march break i thought i would have the best time i took of work and my best friend did too. We spent everyday together, but by the end of march break i wanted to DIE. friends tend to tell you ur flaws over and over again. and over the march break i realized that i had flaws that i did not know about. My friend lets call her ""Sue"" complains that i tend to change when other ppl are around. maybe i do, but its because not alot of people know the real me. she got a new boyfriend and im happy for her, but guess whos the one who changes now. now she talks about me all the time to her new boyfriend and i hate that. and now that i told her that im fed up with that SHE IS MAD AT ME. who is wrong?"

"event","Yesterday was insane. I went to Homassassa with the family, and then came home because dad's gout is acting up. :[
So then I went to the movies with Allie, Brittany, Curtis [DIE], and Taylor. & I specifically said, ""im not going if its going to be a snog fest."" and Donna assured my mom it wouldnt be. So my mom dropped me off at Donna's and we went to drop off Paul to a halloween party at his friends house, which is where we met Allie. So Donna drops us off at the theatre and says ""MAKE GOOD CHOICES, BE A LADY, BRITTANY.""
     So we buy our tickets for S.F.S, and go get our drinks and stuff. And Allie had a waterbottle outside, and the lady told her she had to throw it away. & I had one too, but it was in my purse, so no one knew. :] So we get into the theatre, and I say ""Allie, can I tell you a secret?"" *pulls out waterbottle* and then I hear someone behind me. I swear I thought it was someone who worked there, but it was just Brittany. & Allie was like ""OOH BUSTED!"" ahahaha.
     So then Taylor & Curtis come in, and I give Taylor a hug, because I havent seen him in a really long time. Now the polite thing to do would be to introduce me to Curtis, because weve never met, right? apparently thats wrong. Brittany jussat there with him. The lineup was Allie, me, Britt, Curtis, Taylor. So I told Britt to change seats with Taylor so he didnt have to be by them with no one else there. So then out of nowhere Curtis asks Brittany to move. AND SHE DOES! So we look over throughout the movie, and theyre over there making out. Yeah. Real ladylike.
     So me & Allie & Taylor leave without them, and Brittany comes running over and goes HUH? because I was talking to Taylor. Then me & Allie jsut walked right past her to go to the bathroom. And Apparently she got all sob story on Taylor. Then when we came out she asks me & allie ""ARE YOU GUYS MAD AT ME??"" and allie whispers ""YA THINK?!"" and then she started to cry. and the car ride home was so effing akward because Donna was yelling at Brittany, and Brittany was crying and apologizing and all. And the best part is, Curtis doesnt even know its his fault. :] The entire thing was really retarded, and my mom just told me that Brittanys been crying most of the morning. Give it a rest. please. I told her I didnt hate her, and we were juspissed off because friends come first. And she knows that.
     & Im still mad, and my mother is trying to put this off on me ""because I didnt accept her apology."" WHICH I DID. I told her it was okay and to stop beating herself up about it, just dont let it happen again. Id say I accepted her apology, im just still a little ticked. Dont you think i have the RIGHT to be?! my moms supposed to be on my side. urgh. whatever.

i was really shy at first, and didnt want to dance. but then christian asked me, and at first i was like ""huh?"" and he was like ""i said, wanna dance with me?"" and i was like ""oh sure. but just a warning i cant dance."" and he laughed. then like, 8 seconds later the song was over. lol. sucks anal. but whatever.

we danced. danced. danced. danced. get the picture? thats basically what we did.

And tyhen they kept telling me what a horrible person I was. Second period Mrs. L kept trying to put up posters of Arnold Shwartzanegger, or howveer you spell it, in speedos! It was horrifying. Third period we just read the gayest book known to mankind. Fourth period is math. And we all know I HATE math. Then I went to French and had to finish my final exam. GAY GAY GAY GAY GAY. And the teacher has been incredible faggot like too lately. Sixth period = RETARDED. SEVENTH PERIOD = GAYEST FUCKING CLASS ILL EVER TAKE. I GUARANTEE IT. It's not like I actually learn anything in there ANYWAYS, so why am I there? BECAUSE HES GAY. THATS WHY. I turned in my outline, and he graded it on a scale of 25 this time, and I got a 17. So I asked why, and he tells me ""You didnt highlight two pages."" SO THATS WORTH 8 POINTS?!?!? I DOUBT IT CONSIDERING AMANDA ONLY DID ONE SECTION AND GOT 100. HES SO GAY. I WISH HIS FOUR HUNDRED AND WHATEVER YEAR OLD SELF WOULD GO TEACH SOMEWHERE ELSE. HONESTLY. I DONT THINK IVE EVER HATED ANYONE ELSE SO BADLY IN MY LIFE.


Just wait, it gets EVEN better! :D

So I go to volleyball, and were doing conditioning. What else is new, right? So he tells us he has a meeting, and that we have to run the school. No big deal considering we do that everyday anyways. FIVE TIMES HE SAYS. FIVE TIMES! So naturally, I do four because he came back early, and then he makes us do twice around the track. LUNGES. You cant even imagine how happy Ill be when volleyball is not on my daily curriculum.

So then Im walking home, and I get honked at by these mexicans. GRRRRRRRRREAT.

Whatever. More tomorrow? Expect the worst."

The day was cool though. First period me & Halee just sat around and talked. Second period we watched Ever After. Third period we read our novels. Fourth period [ugh] she was convinced she could get through an entire lesson. [LET ME LAUGH. HA.] Fifth period we went to Oktoberfest. Pizza & Coffee for me, ha. That sounds so disgusting. xD Lunch, I just sat there and told Simba about the muffins, and seventh period we answered five questions. lol. fun day, right?

"event","ugh. dude. last night was SO difficult. I deleted my myspace, it was so hard. I sat at the screen staring at the ""cancel account"" button for like, half an hour before I actually clicked it. ahaha. It doesnt matter though, it needed to be done. Although I do admit, I`m already missing it and it hasnt even been 24 hours yet! I`ve caught myself at the login screen five times since Ive been home, which shows me how TRULY ADDICTED I was. I`m proud of myself, because Ive thought of doing it before, but didnt actually think I`d do it. 

I`m noticing that Ive changed a lot. Some ways for the best, and some ways NOT so much. Ive started to notice Im really tempermental, and the slighest thing sets me off. I dont know whats wrong with me! Im just uncondiotnally moody lately, and I dont like it. Im snapping at some of the coolest kids I know, and my parents too. That never happened before. Now my parents, well, my dad, is telling me that Im inconsiderate and I dont show enough respect. Which really bothers me because I never used to be this way. :[ & Honestly, I dont WANT to be this way. Ive also noticed that the stupidest things annoy me. I dont know, maybe Im maturing out of my FOUR YEAR OLD self?

Anyways, back to life. Today was terrible. I felt like such an idiot. Typically, it`s a monday, so I figured my day would suck, but I didnt know it would be that bad. In French class, the teacher made me do superlatives, the first one in class. I DONT EVEN KNOW ENGLISH SUPERLATIVES, THANKS?! I dont know, maybe he was ticked that he`s getting OLD?! ahahaha.

I`m getting more tired, and more stressed every single day. It seems the WEEKENDS arent even good anymore, because I know I have to spend them doing my effing outline. But whatever. I`ll get through this.

Im also having some questions. I liked this kid for a YEAR STRAIGHT, and I dont think he ever knew. But now, I like him again, and I dont know what to do, because Im too nervous to say anything, because what if he doesnt feel the same way? Things would be totally akward, and hes my best friend. :[ I hate when this happens.

Im going to try and post EVERYDAY, since I no longer have myspace. But this is just for me. So if youre reading it, Id appreciate you dont anymore? & PLEASE STOP. :]"

im marissa. im fourteen. i have blonde hair. i have green eyes. im extremely tall for my age [so ive been told] i listen to different types of music so dont complain to me about how ive never listened to that one band and i stole them from you, because chances are i DO listen to them and youre an effing idiot. i dont drink. i dont do drugs. i dont do bad things. thats just the kind of kid i am. im outspoken, and pretty random. i like to have fun, i like to be alone. dont even take that the wrong way because i know some of you will think [shes trying to make herself gothic or something] not the case. youre not right about everything, niether am i. get over it already. my opinions change a lot so if i say i liek something one day and hate it the next [or vice versa] dont go insane on me saying i hated something or whatever and i copied you. once again, i didnt. i just change my mind a lot. jeez.


the not so obvious
i like to act like im three years old, im not sorry if that bothers you. i watch little kid shows, and not to be 'cool' because ask anyone who thinks its retarded: watching a show like pokemon at the age of 14 is stupid, and normal kids get made fun of because of it. but certain people can pull it off without getting made fun of, and thats what bothers me. some kids seriously LIKE the show or whatever, and get made fun of, and other kids watch it because they heard it was kind of hardcore. not the case idiot. i have a problem with society. a big one. dont ask me to explain it because chances are i cant. i have nothing to prove to you.

the opinions
there are certain people i just CANT get along with. dont ask me why, but i try to be the better person and let things go, but ive changed that. im sick of people walking all over me. in my opion, it sucks.

in my opinion, stereotypes are really dumb. especially the 'emo', 'hardcore', 'punkass' ones. other people agree with me. yet, we all use them every day. thats another problem with society. if you think something is wrong, DONT TAKE PART IN IT. jeez.

in my opinion, i feel bad for eating meat. i feel bad for all the animals and such, yet i eat it all the time. why? because its good. so obviously im not a vegan. i want to be, but id never be able to make it.


the im sick of`s
im sick of:
everything i stated in this bulletin.
people who treat me like dirt.
people in general.
sterotypes.
being made fun of.
people saying they hate where they live, because they dont.
cliques.
politics.
rain.

and lastly, im sick of:

YOU."

So basically, BEST DAY EVER. I wake up, knowing todays the day, and I get so excited I make myself sick. So I go to school, it was actually a pretty cool day, and Mom picked me up at 1.45 ish? Then I came home, to find my LOVELY COUSIN, ERICA, is sittinjg on my bed. At first, I was like, WHO THE HELL`S ON MY BED?!?! Then I was happy. :]

Then we caught up on some things, and we went to Tampa for the concert. We got there at around 6:15, so we went down to floor level after buying some merch, like my shirt,and my poster, and my Ericas FFTL shirt, and our blinky fall out boy hearts. We were like, 20 feet away, no more, from all the bands. Erica used all her film on Sonny and From First To Last, of course. Then Pete Wentz came out, and they like, but each other. It was too cute! :D We missed October Fall, but, thats okay. So Sonny came on, everyone was moshing and all. So after like an hour, Hawthrone Heights came on, they werent too bad. Then All American Rejects. They were SOOOOO great. & nice too! Like these two chicks had been to fifty concerts, so they sang PERSONALLY TO THEM!! And Tyson filled in words to songs wiht TAMPA BAY. It was too awesome.
Then afterwards, Fall Out Boy came on and I immediatly put my heart in the air. Pete smiled at me & I basically DIED. They opened with OUR LAWYER MADE US CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS SONG SO WE WOULDNT GET SUED...and they did some old stuff too. Pete cursed a lot. And he threw guitar picks & stuff, but we didnt catch any. THE PETE CROWDSURFED! Patrick didnt say ANYTHING, the entire show! But we later found out IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY!! So Pete went on about this tradition of every year he puts a cake on patricks head, but since Petes been such a jackass, Patrick would do that for HIM. So Patrick grabbed the cake and dumped it on Petes hair, then chucked the rest into the crowd. i`m NEVER washing my shirt. Lol. Then they threw towels, and all that jazz. There was fire and everything. xD!! Then Pete Jumped into the crowd again, and i came like, 2 inches from touching him. If this chick werent in my way I wouldve grabbed on and never let go. But he smiled, and that was DEFINITELY enough. :D

After the concert, Erica bought a HEROINE beltbuckle,a nd I got FALL OUT BOY shoelaces!!

& this concludes the best day of my life."

"event","So yea. Today at school we had the Vball County Championships. We came second ahainst west hernando...not too bad, considering we only lost by four point in the third game.




now this is where it gets CRAZY. Me, Alex, Alycia, Danielle, and Jen all went to the bowling alley. SO apparently right before I got there some lady gave Alycia and Jen hugs cuzz they were form Boston. and she said she hated Florida because it looked like....yea you probably dont even want to know. lmfao.



So then we all went inside and started our game. And Jen had skittles,a nd I had cherry coke...and yea. Its jsut too much to type. So then one time Alex like THREW the ball and it made the loudest noise and we were cracking up.So then this guy in the lane next to us goes OH SH*T DID YOU SEE THAT?!?!??!?! It was so fricking hilarious. And then Liz came and boy did she make things even better. After we were done bowling we went downstaris to the arcade, and we got hooked on this one game where you win candy. And then the lady yelled at us cuzz it was time to leave and we werent done. And then the machine kept dropping Liz's candy so she was cursing it out and crap...omfg it was soooooo great.



Then Alex's mom took us all home and outside my house I have this Halloween Mickey blow-up thing, so it fell over and everyone was like WHAT THE FLIP IS THAT?!?!?!?!?


It was so much fun. Im so effing hyper now. But im also really tired...gah..




Today is definately Iza's fourteenth birthday. You etter have told her happy birthday or I'll chomp your face off.

"event","Okaa, so ALOT has happened throughout the past couple of days.:)
   

So Monday night we went to the hospital and Mommy spent the night there, while I spent the night at Brittanys.:) We watched Ice Princess. So then Tuesday we went in the pool, and then the hospital cuzz Mommy had the baby.:) Little Aidan...:)Then Tuesday night I went back to Brittany's, and we swam.:) lol. Then Wednesday we went in the pool, and then to visit Mommy.:) Where me and Mommy ventured across the hospital in search of candy.:)



Then that night, Grandma picked me up, and I spent the night at her house. We got some chinese food, and started watching Cursed, but then we turned it off and watched First Daughter on HBO.:P


So then Thursday morning, we woke up and went ot breakfast with my cousin.:) Shes 18, and pretty darn cool.8) (We'd never met before, cuzz she lives in NY) But anyways, then me, and her, and her aunt went over to the beach, where she stubbed her left foot on a rock, and i hurt my right foot on another one.:( lol, So then the beach was getting really hot, and she saw...""fins"" So we were like OMG! OMG! And then I figured they were probably dolphins since they werent attacking us.:P Then it got too hot, and we went back to thier hotel and swam, where the water was STILL pretty hot, but refreshing.:) Then we dried off, and went to Dairy Queen, cuzz they dont really have those in New York I guess...:( Medium vanilla cone with rainbow jimmies baby.:) Classic...:)


Then we came back to my house, where Mom and Dad and Grandma and Aunt awaited us.:) So we talked for a bit, and then they all left. So we orderd pizza and stuff... and I told everyone all about my baby brother Aidan.:) 

He's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sweet.:):):):):):):):)



So then today we went up to the school to check my homeroom. ALEX IS IN WITH ME!!!!!x_x!  But now Chris is depressed cuzz he doesnt have any of his ""close"" friends with him...:( Im pretty upset about that myself...


Probably going to visit Aidan later.:)

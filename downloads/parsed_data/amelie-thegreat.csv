"event","Emotions surge like raging seas, I look but I can''t see.
Where are you, what are you doing and who am I without you
The thought of life without you makes me physically sick
I love you more than i can explain
Its a love I dont even understand
My hearts beats faster and faster.
Every breath slowly fades and I 
can no longer feel the rise and fall of my chest
Its slowing down. My heart snaps. 
But I was prepared for this, once more. 
I am not who i used to be. 
Above all my hope is in you alone my Lord
The maker of the heavens and the earth
Through tears and my mascara stained face
I see you. I see your hand. 
I see Hope."

"event","Its so weird, I dont know just what to think of me these days. 

I've moved back to the suburbs. 

I know there's nothing wrong with the suburbs, and high five if you live, and have always lived in the burbs... im just finding it hard to adjust to 2 years living out of home in the inner city, all the freedom you can poke a stick at, everything you need right at your door step and now... i got sick, i couldn't work... and here i am back home with mum and dad. Its always harder when you've tasted living without your parents. Plus, all my friends are in West End and its at least 5 or 6 months before i can move back out. Oh, well. Thats life and i'll be damned if i don't use this season to its advantage. I get everything free, nutritious meals (!), clothes washed and ironed every day and all the luxuries of the parental home. Its such a load off to know that i dont have to live like i dont have 2 cents to rub together. 

I got sick and went to hospital. I'm pretty much better now, apart from some wounds that need to heal. Some scars that need to form. Its so ironic, isn't it? (i understand me)

I'm writing this  because i dont actually think anyones gonna read it.. haha.. let me know if you do. 

This whole year has been like a battle field. I think bad stuff decides to happen all at once sometimes, and theres really no fixing life's perpetual rollercoaster. The older you get, the more life you experience, the more you realise that nothing is - or was ever meant to be easy. Some days are good, some days aren't so good. Its just how you choose to deal with them is what will make your life great. I think everybody should be told that from the moment they're born. It would save a lot of naive expectation that everything is just gonna be a breeze, cos it isn't. The only way i ever know anything is ever going to be all right is when i look to my awesome, great big God and see that its all in his hands. Sometimes we just have to stop telling God what to do and just let him do what only he does best. 

Here's what a mean about scars. A scar is a permanant reminder of an event that caused pain, mess and a day that you will never ever forget. Its etched on your skin. A wound is fresh, it still hurts, its still messy and requires attention. Eventually, as time passes, it goes through various stages of getting harder and  less painful. In the end... its just a hard patch of skin that looks different to the rest of your skin. 

You get scars emotionally too.Theyre the ones real close to you, right next to your heart. And then... your heart gets hard. But you have a choice to let those times get you or you can just keep living. 

This entry is random. If you read it and weren't me. I just cant explain right now.

"event","Its funny how i only ever update this when i am at uni!! Cos i am so bored in these breaks right now...

I havent posted in this for ages, and i so do not work at subway anymore. I work at Kindercraft Child Care in City Hall. And... I love it. 

In other news, i am living in West End in the Jane St House, which I am loving... i love the kath and kim, lano and woodley and the neighbours thing. And of course the 3 cool chicks i live with Erika, Jem (who i call Jim, cos thats how all the new zealanders say it, and man do we know the whole of new zealand or what?) and good old betty joo.

Nothings the same as last year. Reading those entries was like... whoaaa.... thats crazy how i functioned every day life like that for so long and now i am very very far from that place. I am so excited to say i have come quite far from there. This year i have learned the importance of doing everyday life well. This is one of the best things i have ever learnt... because greatness can only ever be measured in how somebody lives their day to day life. If i live my days sleeping, bumming around and doing nothing i will never reach the goals i have of being prosperous and active in whichever career i am passionate about, which of course is children. Likewise, if i spend my days wishing i was somehwere else in another time, i am doing nothing to get to that place. God has called me for a time such as THIS. Not a time such as 2 years away. That will all happen when it does. 

I am so confident that whatever comes my way, my great big God can deal with it. I want to live out of complete faith and trust, with a can-do attitude in everything i do. I have learnt so much with this leadership training about just doing my life how God says. Bad circumstances cause desperation which leads to perserverance, and eventually a miracle. That miracle leads to freedom. Just like the woman with the issue of blood in Mark chapter something in the bible, that woman was like fully suffering and as she reached out to touch jesus there in her desperation was the miracle she had wanted. As she touched him her bleeding stopped. Then she was free. It was not without bad circumstance and depseration. If life was perfect, who would need a miracle? Nobody, then we'd never know the spirit of God. We'd never know true freedom. 

God is so good."

"event","The only word I can think of to describe what it feels like to be me right now is CRAZY. Full on. Man, I had the worst day at work today. I am so completely over it. I went in at seven am to open the shop, and i did what I do every other day when I open. And that is what needs to be done. I did five bakes of bread before the doors were open. I fully had such a great morning, simply because I don't really (anymore) have must of a capacity to be stressed out. My hope is in God alone. Being stressed out has just became pointless. Then.... people arrive. And suddenly all that I had tried hard for had become meaningless, and not good enough. It was like evrybody wanted to come down on me for, yet again, something that I hadn't done (or done properly). I hate it. I am so sick of working for somewhere like subway. I know that the boss has the store on the market anyway... so as if he cares.

I left the store at the stroke of one o'clock, wanting to run far far away from any sort of responsibility I have for the next ten years or so.... but when I got to my car it was really cool because Tom's car was right next to mine. It made me happy to think that I was in the most crappy mood and just wanted to cry and as soon as i left, one of my most favourite people in the world's car was next to mine. I know he wasn't driving it, but his dad would have been and he is also one of my favourite people in the entire world. 

But I still cried.

I got home to find my beautiful Joey (on my computer!) but greeting me at the door. I would have loved to play with her this afternoon but God was on my case about getting my butt to uni and stopping my avoiding responsibilities manouvre. I was so close to just going to sleep and saying ""SCREW THE WORLD!"" but sometimes things suck and the purpose of sucky things is to pick yourself up and to get on with what it is that God has you to do. And for me, thats going to work to make money and going to uni to be the best children's pastor I can be. 

There's so much to do and so little time to do it, I am worn out and ready to collapse in a pile. I'm opening the shop again in the morning, very aprehensive about how to do it better and nervous about entering that environment again, but what I know is that I have got the shadow of heaven behind me and aI can do all things through christ who strengthens me. 

Psalm 84: Blessed are those who dewll in your house, they are ever praising you. Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on you. We will go from strength to strength, until we see you face to face.
Psalm 121: I lift up my eyes to the hills, where does my help come from? It comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and Earth. 
Psalm 46: Though the mountains tremble and the rivers quake with their surging, I will not be afraid. ... God is my very present help in times of trouble. 
Psalm 112: Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, their children are robust on the earth. They are generous and lend freely.

""Do not let your hearts be troubled, trust in God trust also in me. In my fathers house there are many rooms, that youw ill also be where I am. I'm going now to the place where I am going.... "" John 14:1-4 (sorta)

""He saved us, not because of the righteous things we've done. He saved us, by his mercy, his mighty mercy through jesus christ the son"" - Titus 3:5

I have had the best revelation of what mercy is this week - courtesy of the vines expository dictionary: 
MERCY: not simply filled with pity, but actively compassionate towards others."

"event","I just walked through this big patch of smoke this guy was smoking away and I thought, that smell has such a link and then i remembered... my childhood. When I think of cigarettes i think of RSLs, and footy clubs, places where feral kids run around unsupervised (which wasn't me, we were not children of smokers, nor were we feral to my knowledge) and also my cousins and relatives who smoke/d, and when you have to kiss everyone at family functions and you get up close and they smell like an ashtray. 

I think something else too - profound i know- but like psychology theory, i think when you get older things in your thinking change. As a kid you wonder why older people like to remenisce so much. Kids do not care for remeniscing. Have you ever seen a bunch of five year olds talking about the good old days... no. Nor do they really care about stories you have of them as a baby. Why? Because kids arent satisfied with what has been done, or what they have done in the past. They do not find it interesting any longer. They want to do new things, be a superhero, find out everything and make changes to the world (whether it be through fame or influence or whatever)... the fact is this... kids believe that the best is yet to come. 

Ahhhh!! revelation. Fully. 

Nic and I were talking the other day about that. The best is fully yet to come. And to not believe that is to limit God's capacity in your life. I believe the best days have not happened to me yet. The best meals have not been eaten. The best books have not been read. The best sermons have not been preached. The best worship songs have not been written. The most influential leaders have not been born yet.... it blows my mind. You know why? things can only get better. Passing from this generation to the next is the big picture. What do we pass on... the gospel of Jesus Christ not like a stale daggy -ness... but a full on privlege of knowing and serving the living God.

Thats why I love kids and children ministry so much. Look at the opportunities here. This is up front. This is why I do it. This is my life in a nutshell. Love God, love people. Pass on the flame. The best is so yet to come and I am going to believe that until I give my last remaining breath in worship. 

I am so sick of living like this isnt the very best day of my life and tommorow will be even better. I am so sick of thinking that last night was more fun than today. Or that the week of breakthrough was a great week and now I am just back to everyday life. That sucks. I am so not into saying that life is Ok when in fact it has never been better, and if it has been.... I want to know in what way? God never inteded us to live life full of awesome events? And what makes them awesome is great people and the presence of the living God... and since I am surrounded by my friends every day and I have Jesus living inside of me there is NO EXCUSE for this not to be the best day I have ever lived. 

I may be so busy I havent got time to pick my nose, I may be going from place to place in the early hours of the day doing a million things but there is nothing my God can not do... he is the author and finisher of my faith and I am so prepared to give it all to him. 

Jesus, I love you. Thankyou for all youve done. I want to worship youw ith every breath I take and every menial thing I put my hand to. You are all I need and I give all that I am to you.
Amen"

"event","Last night I got a call from Jon saying i didnt need to go into work today cos they were overstaffed, so today i basked in my holidays and woke up at ten. Then i went and saw leah and thought maybe we should go to Hemmant to where my sisters grave is- we have been wanting to do it for a while so we did. Then we got there and it was so weird, the grave had some flowers on it. I was spun out because I sort of thought maybe nobody ever visited it. I thought maybe birthdays and death anniversaries, but not like random times. These flowers were fake but not OLD fake, like new fake. Still were brightly coloured pink. So I searched for something to leave, and ended up with a gumnut, a stick and my pucca key chain. Its my trademark, so if any of my family go there it will be kinda obvious. Oh well. Maybe I want it to be.

So we left there and went driving- saw a sign for the FISHERMAN ISLANDS and thought that sounded nice. So we went on thsi pursuit for the Islands which were so pov, we went to Gibson Island which is like a picturesque (maybe not) industrial island. We wanted some tropical music to set the scene, it would have been hilarious. Then we went to the Port of Brisbane, which I am sure is not the real Port of Brisbane. Surely there has to be a ""nice"" port of brsibane. I mean theres an ad for it. 

Well, fun games, never been there before. Leah and I did a S.O.A.P there (bible study) and drank lots of water and needed to pee. Then we went home. 

I feel very uninspired now to do anything actually productive. I have to do my church work but kind of not wanting to. I should be planning for July but dont want to. I am feeling so lazy. Thats probably exactly why I should go and do all those things. I am fasting, so i think thats the source of my laziness. I am flipping starving but i know i am gonna do this. I want to do it on water alone. I want more of God and less of what I can do. 

Now that I know I am being lazy i think I am gonna go straight to the house of God and do some work!"

So after i hand this CD in I am totally done for like four weeks with uni. Yeehah. I have been waiting for this moment for quite some time. 

Last night was heaps good at church, Allanah got baptised... and it was generally quite a random night. We hung out with Ben and Tom, that always makes for a good evening- some of my favourite play dates come from them. Went to spoon but it was really expensive so we just went to subway and then sat on the bum stairs- HEIGHT OF CLASS mind you. 

Can't wait to go home and completely veg. How come when you write veg it looks like VEG (hard G sound). Wha happened! haa haa. 

I'm gonna go home now, my prediction is that Leah will intercept me at the door, invite me over for a coffee and a soap. I hope so :)

(PS. soap is a bible study, not an actual cake of soap. Perhaps when i write acronyms in the future i should write S.O.A.P - uh! remember that 1998 band?? This is how we party, movin with your body come on everybody, can't get enough of you... haa ha)"

I am farting around on the uni computers looking at the AB website, my compy isn't technologically advanced enough to support such a cool website, darn 1998 technology. I am in the weirdest mood.

 Well fasting yesterday, maybe i cheated a bit with the smoothie and thickshake, but I didnt eat real dinner I ate flipping snack food (Beas influence) and woke up with the grossest taste in my mouth even though i brushed my teeth before bed, like i ate too many snacks and no actual nutrients. So I am still suffering the conseqyuences of insatiable thirst. I got a V which helped but everyone knows anything that claims to help mental alertness is a big fat crock. 

I was so excited to be completely finished uni today but you know what.... stuuupid things have unfolded such as my CD i wrote for ICT didnt work and i have to make another one, which is soooo gay because it takes forever to write and it sucks because the kid pix program is fully temperamental, with an emphasis on mental. So looks like Monday is another day at the trusty computer lab at QUT. Bum. But you know what? Its all good :) (Relax, GOOD is in control, ref. De Simone, 2004, p.54)

Last night Tom was inside my doona and yet again it got fully munted. TOMMMMMM! Hes a cack. Never seen weekend at Bernies. Man that is a cack. I think I have a theory though... the THEORY of weekend at Bernies is sooo funny, but only small parts of the actual movie are funny. I think I just remember the insanely funny bits. But the general dagginess of the late 80s was worth it.

I need a slight break. Man I feel so weird today I have not really talked to anybody. Only the random passers by I know and I saw Naomi from work which was random. 

Church was fabulous last night, I couldnt get the smile off my face... cos I knew that Erika would like it. I always get so nervous bringing ppl to church thinking they will hate it but i realise its my own fathless thinking there. The place is buzzing. Its fully like the most amazing vibe I've ever been in and i suppose thats why I am still there after almost three years. Yeehah. It was so cool, she was so touched by God. I'm looking forward to seeing what becomes of this, and I am sure shes gonna get fully planted. 

I didn't go out last night, mostly because I had no money but partly because Tom wasn't there... sort of ruins the tradition... I missed him yesterday, he is on camp at somehwere... forget where though. There was many a joke, comment about him via the pulpit and I was like... aww tommy... if only you were here to hear everyone laughing at you.  But anyways Dan came over and we had tea and wafer biscuits. I decided I would like to put maple syrup in my tea (thanks joey shhh haha) and it was cool. Dan is great :) Im really glad he was my flatmate for a year because I would have never gotten to know him otherwise. He is very serious, very organised, very melancholic but yet he is hilarious. I had to make a grey undies crack at him while I had the chance. I was like... ""I miss you Dan, and your grey undies..."" he's like, kinda laughed kinda was like ""HEY STOP PAYING OUT MY UNDIES!!"" haa haaa. Oh, Dan.

I am really happy with my industry today, although I did skip a class but it doesnt matter because all we do in it is watch ppl teach and sit on the floor a lot. Everybody gets scared their bum crack will show and nobody wants to sit in front of anybody else and therefore we get this reluctance to sit down type of thing and not to mention that the floor is some sort of cold tiles or lino or something... so all I can think of is the piles... all about the piles ""dont sit on cold floors or youll get piles""... and I'm yet to see or hear of anybody who has actually got piles from sitting on cold floors. Actually I dont really want to see anyones piles. 

I am playing with Fia and Louis on Saturday. I am so excited. I can't wait to just get them and hug them and play!!! I want to get out Hi 5 DVDs and other interactive things, and get all the musical instruments from church and go nuts with them!! I'm thinking we can have a singing, dancing adventure. We could make some sort of cake, but I dont think the appreciation is there yet at 2 and 1 yrs old... I'm sure Fia would like it but Lou is a bit young. Actually they are both allergic to wheat and dairy too so we would have this like gluten free, lactose free, dairy free cake which may or may not taste like a frisbee.  I havent hung out with them in ages, since Lou has began to walk so I am sure I am in for a challenge. The last time they came over it was a huge storm, the day before I went to Sydney with Bella and the power went off, the heat was disgusting... I couldnt open the windows as rain would come in... and I couldnt close them because it was too hot. I put Louie down in my room and he cried the worst I have ever heard him... the kinda cry where you know you cant leave him. I was standing outside my room hoping he would settle down but it just got worse and worse and eventually I just picked him up again. Fia took a while to sleep because the thunder and lightning was so loud but she eventually dozed off. Joey was proud of her efforts. 

Ahhh kids. I played with Bella the other day. She is a most intriguing baby. I love her so much, I can't even imagine how I am going to love my own child more than I love Bella, Louis and Fia... (i love rosie, holly, annabelle, cooper, and amy too but i just know those three more) . But with Bella, I just feel like I have known her for so long and spent so much time with her that I know all of her ways... I know what she means when she does or says anything. And its cool to think I will know her for the rest of her life. I am so excited to be such a part of their lives... man, i love my job. (well prospective job, current department...) Kids are so important.

"event","What is it that makes a girl settle for a life less than she deserves? What is it in the human condition that forces women to promote their bodies in order to gain acceptance, an unfaithful boyfriend and at the least, money for the next rent payment? 

I am reading the Autobiography of ex-spice girl Geri Halliwell. Only half way through (and loving it!) it has occurred to me that there are so many lies floating around in the heads of girls. You must vomit up every meal or only eat salad to be beautiful. You must have a boyfriend to be loved. Drugs are a great source of happiness. Isn't it simple? There is not one person in this world who can make it on their own. We need something to give our lives to, we all need something to hold on to and believe in. Problem is, we're just looking in the wrong places. 

I remember as an eleven-year-old girl, I was insanely obsessed with Alanis Morisette. She was almost God to me. I dont know how I began to like the music of such an angry woman (!), who said the 'F'word more than I should have been hearing, but somehow what she was saying caught me. Through the vocabulary of somebody in their late twenties, I caught what she was saying before my teens. The world sucks and we need something to hold on to. What? She couldn't tell me. 

Next, I began to be an avid 'Home and Away' fan. I thought, maybe just maybe if I hit the big time I can be on Home and Away. I would watch it every night, and I would dream about the day I would grace the set of Summer Bay. I remember my mum and dad dragging me out of the house crying, because them taking me out for dinner would mean I would be missing Home and Away. Why did I like Home and Away? It represented all that I wanted in my life at that point - fame, fortune and my future.

By half way through year seven, I had jumped on the Spice Girls Band Wagon. Perhaps the biggest obsession I had ever had (and will ever have), this journey was about two years long. From 'Wannabe' to 'Goodbye' I was there. I had posters on my walls plastered with pictures of the fab five. I taped their concert in Istanbul, and learned all of the words, and the dances... I watched their movies twice at the cinema and over thirty times on the video that I was so desperately trying to pay off by washing cars for $5, that my dad paid it off for me. I constantly thought about how I could be a Spice Girl, how I could meet the Spice Girls, how if I thought about them... I'd somehow be closer to them. I wanted something to worship so badly it hurt. I prayed to God every night, though I didnt know him, and my prayer said this,"" Dear God,please forgive all my sins and thankyou for all youve done for me. "" This was the mandatory line I had learned would keep my butt covered in times when I did something really bad. I went on, ""PLease make me famous, marry Prince William and meet the Spice Girls. Amen.""  I would go off to sleep believing somehow that they would all magically happen, knowing that if they did it would be acredited to me, not God. 

I suppose thats why I am enjoying Geri's autobiography so much. I am understanding why she said everything she said, did everything she did and why things happened for her like that. I understand, before even reaching the part about the Spice Girls how she left first, and what experiences had led her to this place of finding instant gratification, and how much it did not even slightly satisfy her. Sad, but true- life wasn't meant to be easy. After all, if it was, who could say that they needed God?

By the middle of 1999, the Spice Girls had faded off into the background and we stopped pretending to be them. Without an obsession... I did life only for a short time before I began to like the band 'Killing Heidi'. Soon, their faces were on my walls, their CDs were all I played and every magazine with the in it was mine. I met them every chance I could, at instores and concerts. They fulfilled me with a once again grim message about the world around us. I think their byline should be 'Being popular is lame, wearing too much make up isn't good, if you are a reject why don't we hook up and get rejected together'. It suited me well right about then... but still wasn't what I was looking for. Rejected acceptance wasn't the answer I needed. It had to be grander than that! There had to be more to life than dreadlocks and piercings. 

Maybe I thought I had found it when I heard Vanessa Amorosi sing. A girl perhaps only a few years older than me, and somehow I thought she had what I needed. Soon the rock band posters lay on the floor while I put up pictures of my new found obsession. The funny part is, while I loved Vanessa, it was nothing of the Lesbian variety. Though in my obsession I began to make friends on the internet, who later told me they were of 'that variety'. I ran for the hills... I liked boys too much for this to be lifes answer!

My first encounter of the real answer to life happened in that period. I began to go to a church occaisionally, and learn about God, but I had no way of practically applying it to life. So, suddenly I found a new answer. It was acting. I read books about it, dreamed about it, talked about it... everything. It was my life. Then I had a drama teacher who I became closer to than I should have, and we were both suffering from grief at the time. Her mum had died and my friend had just passed. We clung to each other because we fed off one another's depression. I thought she had the answer. A gothic, lesbian, thirty-something who looked about 20 through her face of pale make up. I thought her tarot cards, her grave yard meetings and negative views of Christianity held the answer... a truth just of my own. But you know what, it didn't fulfil me. Not one bit. She left for London and I was left standing alone. 

Half way through grade 11, I went on a camp that was to change my life. I found the answer. Re-hashed, recycled and retold truth that I had heard about since I was old enough to hear. How could the mouldy old, bearded, gigantic God of the Heavens be that answer? I had no idea. But as I lifted my hands and worshipped him in an old cafeteria hall, his spirit confirmed that this was the truth I had searched for. He was the God of the impossible, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. He was so able to wash away the stains of my past and misconceptions of my future. 

I knew as I breathed in his air, that I had never seen life like I had just then. And three, almost four (since I began the journey) years later here I am charging on for Jesus. He is the undying truth people are looking for. Somehow it doesn't seem cool enough, exotic enough or 'free' enough - but if only they would try him out... because there is nothing to lose. You hit or you miss. I'm telling you, he is the truth I had searched for.

So you can look to be instantly gratified, you can go from one boyfriend to another, one rave to another, one drug to another, one Friday night pub crawl to the next - but from a place of experience, I can tell you that you will be searching for more until the day you die. 

All I know is that I will give my last remaining breath in worship. Thats how serious I am."

"event","So I'm here still at the 24/7... life is great and things are panning out really well. I'm surprisingly awake for the amount of time I have slept - which is virtually nothing compared to usual. I think that all goes down to the fact that being in the house of God, his peace is so abundant. Its awesome. The atmosphere is so addictive - and so good for the token senguines. I am like, awake all the time, or sleeping with one eye open just to see who walks through the door next - its just so awesome to be with God and his people. Its so fulfilling. 

Gods been speaking to me lots about where I am with my ministry. Its like, I came into this week slightly, yet secretly doubtful that I was capable of rising up to where I needed to be with the kids. And in that doubt (and i daresay doing nothing about it) it was where I found the keys to exactly where i wanted and needed to be. And that was cathching a new dream for what my purpose with the kids was. Its no longer doing all the hard yards with tehm teaching, but rather being a behind the scenes woman and spending time and money hanging out with the children one on one.

In other news korinne is moving out on saturday and joey is moving in. I am shocked to say the least, but excited at the prospects it will bring. Sharons moving also, in a couple of weeks, which is sort of not a shock and not so fast.

I just finished watching some random best of the late show episodes. Ohhhh what a cack!! The dickhead tonight was my personal favourite I must have wathed it seven times.... the bit that gets me though is when this kid goes ""Mum, can we have dickhead tonight tommorow?"" cos hes trying not to laugh cos he gets to say dickhead. 

Ahhh... crazy. Norman Yemm made this cameo appearance, and I cacked myself and smsed louise brown, cos we share this hilarity of Norman Yemm...back in 2000 she did a dancing show with him in it, well he was like a guest appearance and he did like the funniest most random things. But all seriously. 

I'm lovin this relient K CD i got for christmas, thanks shaz. Its awesome. 

I'm also lovin psalm 112. Great Jorb. Its like about how blessed ppl who love God are and their families are all rockin and stuff... they are generous always and can lend freely and their kids are fully blessed. I'm lovin that promise.

I have watched so many movies lately its so uncool cos all i want to do is watch movies and I want to do nothing cos I would have done everything but having no car is like... i just cant achieve what i want to achieve. It sucks. But God is good.

I've been thinking a lot about my ex-life as a performer lately. I hate to say it but I kinda vaguely miss it. I was watching a lot of spy kids and lizzie maguire and  alexa vega and hillary duff just remind me of everything I wanted to be. Its not like I have it in me to do acting ever again, but i just look at child actors and think, wow... (like the realllly young ones) theyve never had an acting lesson in their lives and they just have 'got it'.... where some people have more acting lessons than you can poke a stick at and they just never make it big. I just think I did years and years of training, singing, dancing and acting.... and i never really got any bigger than Mt Cotton drama group. I spose a lack of real finance and agencys was why, and i know exactly why I am not doing that any more.... but wow, its just weird the way things pan out. Im glad theyve gone this way but I also wonder where I am gonna end up. I mean i had so much confidence back then. I could get up anywhere and do anything and I dont know where or when it left.

 Now I have a different kind of confidence, not saying its better or worse cos I still dont know myself... in other things. Like preaching, I can do it and dont feel nervous. Also, I dont even need to fully memorise what I am going to say, or time it very well and it always works out how I want it to. And I'm confident with that. But I can't apply that confidence to acting anymore. I could so not be around actors and strive to be the best because I would get too nervous around even the semi-best. That never happened before and I suppose thats why I gave it up.  The last thing i did was peter pan, back in 2001, and I really enjoyed it... we had a 3 week run, and i got an ok role... but somewhere along the way my plan went pear shaped and I havent missed it until now. Im not about to give up what I have now for a faded dream though- so its ok. I think what happened was god let me know IT WASNT ABOUT ME!! haha."

"event","Wow! What an eventful life I have had lately. You can tell by the way that I have not updated my LJ for quite some time. 

Let me start with the 30th Dec (wow that was LAST YEAR!) well Beatrice had this cold rock birthday party and it was heaps of fun. Leah and I did lots of games for her and it was really good. But I had to go home early cos i had work the next day. 

So... the next day 31st, I woke up at 5am (sparrows fart) and waltzed my way into subway.  I worked there for a long time like 7 hours, got me a sweeeeet Jackie Chan adventures wristband and leah came and got me on her bike and we came back to my house. 

I got my things together, the next minute angie field rocks up and we had ourselves a party!! So we went back to leahs house and watched THE RING, which in fact was much scarier at the movies. Then Ang and Shaz left and Leah and I watched the LIZZIE MAGUIRE MOVIE!!! I was so excited I am such a Hilary Duff fan. We did the game at the end of the DVD and I turned out to be Isabella, which was a little dissapointing cos I desperately wanted to be like Lizzie. But I suppose life goes on.

Then Leah and I got our booties into gear and walked into the city, got some cigars and walked to the Ibis. The room was miniature. It was a fun gathering but the time i spent there was enough for me!! Parties generally make me nervous. Then we went to the Victoria Bridge which was crazy cos we got a great pace to see the fire works but it was like, nobody was excited. It was like...pick the christians! The ones yelling and screaming and cheering and clapping and getting right into the whole countdown buisiness.  It was hilarius.

The next minute Bek and Matt, Josh, Erika (who i dont actually know, but is always with Josh) and John Northwood rock up and it was really cool. We started a fake countdown at 11:59 which really caught on and ended up being true. The fireworks at 12 were bog, and we were convinced they cut the budget - BUT!! the best was yet to come. The rest of the pyrotechnics were good. Josh started a countdown at about 12:05 and we got right into it. Seriously we had a group of about 15 or 20 or so and we were the loudest people on the whole bridge. 

Then Leah and I left, we tried to go to the Hotel terminus but it was shutting and we went to the toilet and nearly saw a guy pull out his weiner to pee.... so we ended up at the lychee lounge where i did like the only over 18 thing i have really done except buy cigars that night, with Leah and got a vodka fire engine. It was a rip man, it cost $8... but i think it was like 1.5 cos it was weird. So we went and sat there (BTW its soooo nice these days, the lychee) and drank and smoked ( theres a big difference between cigar smoking on a new year and chain smoking, likewise having one drink as opposed to five or being an alcholic, just to clear that up haha) and this guy comes and sits next to me.... and hes like a big dork man.... wearing a party hat.... tells me about his greek family. (I found me a greek boy....and he was a DORK!!! d'oh haha) and starts asking me lots of things.... and what I was into and here I am smoking a bloody cigar and drinking vodka, and all I could say was, I dont know. I dont think I could have told him what I liked, just imagine it ""Yeah I want to be a childrens pastor!!!"" So I just laughed and was like... errrr... I study education.  I wanted to run away man... Leah told him we went to church and he goes to the greek orthodox one. And he was like sharing his philosophies of church, and told us he writes poetry (hhaaa) and I am like holding my cack in. Leah asked if it rhymed and he said some did... and shes like holding her cack in. Then he asked about resolutions and stuff and we said we had none and he said he did.... and it was to ""find someone nice"" and haaa haaa I was holding my cack in then, fully, and i am like, well your cutting to the chase!!

Ahhh so we swiftly left the lounge, and back to leahs house. We got our makeup off and comfies on... and went to bed. 

This morning we ate breakfats and watched spy kids 2 and then this afternoon we went out with beatrice and mark and sarah, katie and ang and went to orleigh park, then leah ang, jinny and I went to see .....

SPY KIDS 3D!!!!!!!! ahhhhh! I was so excited. I am a big fan of spy kids. The writer/director/producer Robert Rodriguez is a pure film genius. He just cuts millions off the budget with the way he does things. Its amazing. I watched all the special features and i think the kids are great. Alexa Vega who plays carmen is fully a spy adolescent though.... like about 14 in the 2nd and like 17 in the 3rd. I like her ways though. I think she likes that guy who played Gary Giggles though. Serious chemisrty. Hahaaahhhaa. 

Anyway enough about my being a closet fan of hilary duff and alexa vega.

Now I am at home. Dying of TIRED, and I will go to bed soon after some net time. 

Happy New Year guys. Its gonna be a good one."

I texted korinne many times yesterday and she invited me to melbourne but i cant actually go on account of the fact that i am being a bridesmaide. But i would have. But I am kinda glad cos i want to go to hillsong and play with the kids there.

I am on creche sunday morining. I am really excited about it, cos its like a way lower commitment and a slower pace than discovery. I have to make some phone calls today to ppl who are on that too. But babies are great. Its really boring sometimes with very young children, but i am looking forward to hanging out with the Bella's and Louie.... holly hopefully and annabelle..... wish coops could be part of our gang already.

Well i gotta go shopping I think. Beas party is tonight which will be fun but i am working at the absolute SPARROWS FART tommorow morning like 6:30AM, so on foot this essentially means i gotta leave home by 5:45 argh. 

Hope its not a late night guys. Well i hope somebody else thinks it would be good to have an early night and give me a lift home haha."

My car broke. 
Then I left west end, and today a man got shot there. Glad I wasnt around.

Christmas was great. I have been wherever the wind takes me. Spent a night here, a night there.... and can I tell you, not one of those nights have I spent in the peace of God. They have been TERRIBLE. I havent even read my actual bible for days, because its just so impossible to do that when its GO GO GO with family who just don't 'get'it. I have read WFT, but its been so hard. I have been worshipping to planet shakers CDs... but no word of God, and its killing me. 

Christmas... I went to the beach. We sat around in the wind at Main Beach and ate lunch. I got very sunburnt. Boxing day, i hit the shops and bought many of things. Its been lovely... but I am missing.... everything about my life. Every stability I have seems to be shaken and everything I do is so... not there. 

The following people are away right now : Nichy, Sarah Bailey, Korinne, Thomas, Bryn, and I am sure there are more. Its hard sometimes to live without so many core people of my life. 

I miss everyone so much. I miss actual CHURCH so much. I didnt get to be in Sunday mornings service, only PM which wasnt real church... great but not real spirityyyy. I feel so dry, like nothings working out - but i know... i KNOW i am overwhelmed by Gods love for me. He is amazing. He doesnt give up on somebody who stuffs up all the time. He doesnt give up on a girl who cries all the time because she can't sleep when its hot and she knows she has spent CRAP -ALL amount of time with him. He still says, ""Come iwth me and I'll MAKE YOU"" the only emotion he still feels for me is love... and I know this desert is in eager awaiting for the great river that will flow later this month. 

Christmas is a time that I always spend with my family... and it it great, cos i love them dearly but it sucks not to have more of God here. I want to pray and rejoice and worship him on Christmas day. Not feel like I am sinking deeper into the mud I have made for myself.

I dont know what to do but trust God. He is great. He knows the way. And I will follow him."

My car broke down, for the sixty hundredth time. Uncool. I am quite sick of this but I know God has a better plan for my transportational needs and I need to just trust in that. 

So I left it there, at coles. Then went back to the RACQ man and he told me the CAM DRIVE BELT.... ???? was broken and that it is not cheap. D'oh. So back to the trains for me!! I am without car for a few (let me state 'very important') days. This kinda sucks.

But I am ok. The bad part is, no BELLS for christmas. Its too hard to get to all the places... so I am taking a holiday at Victoria Point for a while. I am looking forward to it. Even if my parents drive me crazy after a while (i am not moving back in, so it should be ok!!)But I love them very much and I know they will appreciate it. 

Guitars, hey Korinne, do flies have blood?? What about exoskeletal insects? Do they have blood, or just lymph like substance...?? How do they live without blood? Does the 'lymph' or 'plasma' or ""THE LASER"" (<- thats a red herring i know) whatever do the same job? 

So now, I have to pack my bags. I am kinda excited about the train since I havent been on one for ages. I think it will feel like more of a real holiday with a backpack and a train. Save petrol money too. 
You see there ARE good points.
I may as well just get a bike. 

Gods good though. Its like no matter what goes on, its hard to hate God or blame him for anything... I just needed to go and YELL like I AM BLESSSSSSSSED. Just calling those thinsg which be not as though they were. Thats the only way to be. Man, God is great."

"event","Last night I had the worst insomniac sleep ever. I had this JOLT creaming Soda last night, purely for the flavour cos they took our favourite drink off the shelf, (d'oh) and yeah I got home and didnt get to bed until 2am and i got home at like 11 or something. And I just sat there writing letters to people and reading the bible and stuff. 

We had the christmas service last night. It was sooo cool. The kids were really good, and the night ran smoothly, it was great. Katy Roubin sat with me, and it was really odd, cos I had all these kids with me(no that part ISNT odd) but like they were just really affectionate, and ...tired... i think. And it was like, here I was in church with this row full of kids and i was like patting their hair as they rested on me. Its like being a mum. I felt like the biggest mum. I think thats whats so cool is that i get all the cool things of a mum without actually having a kid yet. 

I was thinking last night about how COOL it will be when I do have kids. Heres some reasons why:
(1) They will be a genetic mix of me and my husband, who i will love very much and obviously think is the hottest man alive. How cool is like a hybrid of you and the man of your dreams...ahhh.
(2) I will ultimately be responsible for them. That is somewhat scary, but I am so excited about rising up to the challenge. Like, at the end of the day, nobody is going to take that child off of me... its all mine and my husbands. 
(3) We will get to name them. Imagine giving a PERSON a name. Like when you think up a name thats cool in your head, and actually having a legal person with that name. 
(4) We will get to choose exactly how our child looks (obviously not genetically but its 'look' rather). (No hawaaian shirts) Like how cool is that. You get this little tiny baby and you can dress it EXACTLY how youd wish to dress a baby if you had one. I can put MY baby (obviously one i borrowed from God) in a tiger outfit if i so desire.  I saw Joel spencer wearing this outfit yesterday and playing soccer and I thought... ""he looks so cool, and is really cool. If I have boys like him I will be happy"". He was wearing some sort of khaki cargo shorts (long shorts but not 3/4) and this beige shirt that had a truck on it. (toms kids will be wearing mini basketball outfits... haha)
(5) At the end of the day, we will be the ones they want. Like, i think lots of ppl want kids cos ithey will give them unconditional love until the age of knowing if theyre treated craply. Like a baby always goes to sleep and finds peace in its mothers arms. It took me ages to get bella to sleep, but rose who totally knows her would be used to it ya know?? Whenever they are insecure kids want their parents, because they are the picture of stability and everything they need comes from them. Thats why parents need to know God in order for the kids to be getting everything....good that is. Not like spoilt.

Oh there are so many more reasons. I think my kids are going to be like, sooo funny and i think they will be quite naughty too. Maybe not naughty as such but michevious or sneaky and tricky. Like jokers, i bet you they will be. They will probably put things in the freezer when they dont want them anymore. (thats why my freezer is always in such a state. My mum used to get so mad... ""AMYYYYY whyyy are there sooo many unfinished meals, and drinks, and plastic things, in the freezer??????? you leave a trail wherever you go!"") At the moment I have a six pack of yoghurt i will never eat, a penis straw (hens night, didnt buy it myself) and many other things that i thought could live in the abyss of the freezer. 

That is all."

Yesterday was so cool. I woke up and was so bored so I got cheryl to call tom and he never rang back, poo head, and then i realised korinne was home! so we talked and were no longer bored, then made this POOOOOODLE of a gingerbread house. It didnt even stand up. It was so funny. Well it stood for like 2 seconds. We got photos. 

Then we watched the HULK, ohhhh my goodnesss could you get a longer movie. I wanted to be in it for the long haul, but you see we started watching it at like 5:30PM.... and didnt finsish till well past eight. I was like dude i gotta get outta here. So I went to coles, and tom was supposed to call again.... surprise....he didnt! He has proven to be somewhat unreliable in the past day which doesnt impress me too much. 

So we ate much gingerbread house and watched stuf. The night was saved by lovely william taylor coming over, everyone just loves him.... but not as a LOOOOVE... like go will you rock, kinda way. And korinne made us pasta and it was so nice. Thanks Koz.

We talked for a while then I went to bed.

First though I will probably clean my room and have some time with God. Tomorrow, I am thinking of going to my parents house early to just bum around. I was thinking today I can not believe that it is only a week until christmas because christmas holidays usually mean swimming all the time, watching B grade movies about santa being unable to give out presents or kids asking santa for their mum and dad to love each other again.... and living in my togs (believe it or not). We used to always cook too like a gingerbread house, coconut ice or apricot balls. And put the christmas tree up with our favourite christmas carols on. I miss all these things... sometimes I even find myself missing my parents house. LIke these fleeting thoughts about going to live there again. I really did have it good there. Like I just HATE washing, and the way that it is always raining and nothing even feels clean. I miss the dogs and the pool. 

But I know that I will never live there again. I really don't want to... I just wish that I could get my act together sometimes and have neat piles int he cupboard and washed and ironed clothes hanging up.... like all the things I once had. And i think maybe when i am married i will be that organised... but whatever trevor... if i am not organised now when wil i be?

argh. The days of youth."

"event","I am at church again on the beard growing computer. I have just been preparing letters for parentals and leaders and yeah... sending a thousand letters. Well maybe about twenty three. I rang mark usher to remind him  of the christmas service and he was like, yes i heard about that in the letter that had about FOUR PAGES!! He always pays out on my funzone NOVELs but hey... the kids enjoy them. 

Today, I was tossing up whether or not to go to the gym before coming here to church. But I didnt feel too good so i just didnt go. I ate celery for breakfast. Man I love celery... i think its texture is cool. But it has to be super hard celery or thats just uncool. 

Today I am going to be doing lots of things. I am preparing stuff... doing christmas cards for kids... and most fun of all visiting Oscar and Lily. I also may be going to the movies with my sister and her man to see ELF which is pretty exciting.

I have so many things to do yet i cant really think what to do now since mark has left me here to answer phones.

"event","Today has been fun. I got up like about 9 and had to peel myself out of bed due to unneccsary hotness. The fan was virtually useless as it was blowing a lovely array of hot air at me. Sometimes you forget what heatwaves are like cos we have had a pretty extended winter this year. 

Church was good. Matty and I filmed the kids. I *hope* that it will be really good. Dissapointing bit was only 6 kids were there! D'oh! We have a million so whats up?? 

I missed half the sermon due to filming, so i went back up and sat next to tom who was almost falling asleep... he suffered a terrible night of insomnia on account of it being HOT. So much so that he didnt come out for lunch. Uncool. 

Last night Megs hens nite was on. It was a random event with loads of fallic symbols. Like the penis straw. What the..?? Quote of the night - ""Amy its funny to se eyou drinking out of a dick""

We had lunch at happy days today. I love it there.

I also spent some time with Bella Oxenford. I havent seen her for a while, so it was great to catch up. She was wearing the cutest dress. Shes almost one.  I can hardly believe it. She is sooo cute. I want to be her friend her whole life. I think she rocks. 

Friday night was ace. We had planned for Bryn katie thomas and me to have a picnic on the roof. But bumhole bryn who had to go to london DIDNT COME!!!  so... we invited claire hamilton instead. Toms a cack, he is like ""tom and his captive audience of girls"" wherever he goes he has this herom of girls, its hilarius. Funnier still that hes wayyyy... un-metro, so its like really funny.  Korinne comes up on the roof and sees him sitting up telling a long winded story with katie claire and me laying down listening. It looked like Jesus telling a story to the disciples. Except if the disciples were all girls.  We hung out for a good many hours and finsihed the night by Korinne taking thomas and I on an adventure somewhere that was a surprise. 

He complained the whole way that we were going too far... but when we got to his house he sat talking to us for like ages. it was soo funny. 

In other news. God is great. 

Also I watched the Touched by an angel episode that is like a sure fire crying fest every time. Korinne was paying it out so sharon and i made her come and watch it and sure enough she was balling. You dont even need to see the whole episode.... its this scene at the end. It has the spirit of God all over it man... its like... this lady has a son that is dying of cystic fibrosis. He is only like 10 or something and she is a single mum and he is all she has. She has been trying to write a song but wont finish it cos she knows that when she does the son will die. 

Finally she realises she has to... and presents this big concert to him in the front yard of their house and sings it to him.... it goes ""For as long as I shall live I will testify the love be a witness  (something something....) With every breath I take i'll give thanks to God above... (etc etc) "" and the little boy says to this angel, It is finished... and that is where it begins to be full on like ""AHHHHHH"" cos its like straight outta the bible. Then he dies, and his mum is playing the guitar and singing and she sees him die and doesnt give up... she just keeps on singing, and worshipping God.... and then you see her just lift her hands up to the sky and close her eyes and find peace in God.... while she is praising his name....and the people in the background are like totally worshipping God and it is without doubt.... the MOST beautiful scene of film i have ever seen. 

Seriouly i have never felt a Tv show move me like that.  Its like full on, everything i live for. To worship God no matter the circumstance. I cry every time, and i never cry.

Man, God is awesome. I just have this feeling that i dont need to worry about anything and just trusting God will get me everything and everywhere i need. He is so awesome."

Today I have just fully got into deaf ppl again. I was watching play school (i love seeing how ppl get to kids) and there was a deaf person on it. I was like yeeeah. I so have to learn sign language cos deaf kids really get me. Like, i dunno. I remember the first time I had a real moment about deaf kids... I was watching an ad about cochlear implants and just the kids... man... are so grateful for what we take for granted.

Powerball was good last night. I was rather nssed. But Korinne and I went to happy days after. Man I love happy days... but you know the dangers of going to happy days at this hour. But Korinne is really amazing. She was like whats your nss. And so i blurted it out and screamed my guts out to her about whats in my stupid head. But I am ok now. I just needed to get it out. Sometimes people just get on your nerves.

Today I have a very busy day. I just wish i would have known only claire was going to come this morning. I would have cancelled it to free up some time in my manic life!! I mean, i have to reschedule anyway and the people i wanted to be there arent going to be.

"event","... nothing quite like it for skipping the dead.... (the dead is school)

haha. I spent lots of yesterday with the Economidis family. They are FABULOUS! Those boys made Bea and I look cool. Taking Greek kids, not to mention male models, wearing designer outfits (matching even!) to get slurpees was so cool. I spose it would be so random, like its not as if they could be mine or beas actual kids. Cos I would have had to been like 8 when i had them.

Ben and Alex are the bomb. We got them and took them to get slurpees and sat on the kangaroo point cliffs together. Benny had 3 flavours of gum (!)and a chocolate log (!) and decided to have all of them in his mouth at once. Alex cacks at everything, especially if you call him ""Alexander""... he got very surprised when I called him that like, ""How do you know my entire name??"" they are so cute. You just need to have a very good imagination and make up lots of stories, like ""OHHHH what if we were like birds and just could fly over there and like we could just go on their boat and like bomb it with poo and just fly on that bridge too...."" and talk about what if's that will never happen except in kids heads.

Then we took them back and Christos and Juliana (Guiliana?)got us PIZZA!! And we ate dinner with them. Ben and Alex saw the interest I took in their photos, so they showed me like a million and I was so happy. Ben has had like a million pairs of glasses in his day. His first ones was when he was like little little like two, and theyre like the craziest buddy holly like glasses. Then he had these like other just plain metal ones... and more funky ones like he has now. he's cute... I want greek kids with glasses!! Alex and him are great. They were soooo cute when they were babies. And I saw heaps of photos of when Charis was a baby (GORGEOUS)absolutely stunning baby... and kid. Shes so cute. And roman!! AHHH when roman was little, what a cutie!! I cant believe i am only 4 years older than him. Hes like in my era almost. Crap, hes only a year younger than Tom! But Cutie Roman.... I will have to tell him and he'll get all embarrased..hehe.  And Ella and JOsh too. I love knowing their family... all of them. They are just awesome people. I LOVE THEM.

Christos tells so many stories, and theyre soo good. His mum (yaya) is apparently a real cack. Juliana compares her to a theatrical greek woman, like a professional mourner. Haha. I also found out Juliana is half Italian. So ben and alex are half Greek, Quarter Italian and Quarter Australian. How cool is that.

Anyway, enough about them cos seriously I could fill a page about the things I love about the Economidis family(and the jess's, turners etc...) just get me started ... haha

So today my car broke again. I had this day planned. I was gonna go work at church like a real kids pastor and I even was gonna drill this noticeboard into the wall. However, my starter motor packed it in again. Arf. So I called RACQ. And my dad.... i hate it. I have no money so i have to scab off my dad who also has no money. I feel like all i ever say to my parents is sorry. I am sorry my car broke down. I am sorry I dont have enough money to pay for it. I am sorry I didnt know it was going to break down before this. Argh... one day. One day I will be prosperous enough to pay for them to do things. To send them on a good holiday. Do something for all theyve done for me. I suppose it is the role of a parent to bless their kids.... and they dont expect to be paid back. But I feel so bad for taking so much from them. I want to be able to have moved out and said, ""I am fine now. I wont need your money anymore. I can do it."" But instead I couldnt. But thats ok, I act out of who I am not by what happens to me. Jesus is my God, not money.

Sometimes I think the struggles for financial freedom is unfair. But what is that anyway, financial freedom? Freedom from having money strugles. Not freedom from other struggles. Dont you think happiness is more important than money. Often people think they go hand in hand. Like i even think sometimes, if i just had a better car, a better outfit, better hair, better make up, better perfume, a better computer, a better house and money in the bank life would be ok. The problem is, it wouldnt. I have come as far as I have with just about nothing it would seem. I have a crappy 1987 car which is broken as we speak, not to mention broke LAST WEEK, and twenty times before that, (but i love my car, it is my lair)I am renting the cheapest room i can, yet still struggling for cash by the end of the pay fortnight. Daddy stil has to pay for my mistakes. And daddy is as poor as me! But the fact is, i live by faith and not by sight. I live in the realms of the impossible. I call that which is not, as though it were. I love as though my dreams have come true, because they have. My dreams are God. Paul wrote phillipians, the HAPPIEST LETTER of the bible, when his circumstances did not match that of a happy man. He was in Jail, guys. Thats no place to be cheerin. 

Faith is never conditional on circumstances. I believe it."

This means a heck of a lot more responsibility, and willingness to own up for everything that goes wrong!!But I am ecstatic. Tuesday I was on top of the moon. Wednesday I was like, Holy Crap... overwhelmed by all there is to do. Today I am just rollin with it. Its good. All good and I have until late January to get everything done. 

In about an hour and a half I am hanging out with my economidis bro's and Beatrice D. We're gonna get slurpees and go to the cliffs @ KP. Hang out with em and explain everything. I am excited, yet aprehensive, cos of the things i wasnt supposed to do. I stuffed up a bit in regard to this. But its all good. I didnt get into trouble, just corrected. Thats exactly what i want!! Its so hard starting out with really nobody who has pioneered us thus far in kids ministry. Its all up to personal opinion and preference with some things and just following what God says for the rest. Do your best and let God do the rest!! arf...

Speaking of guitars... I was thinking about Bryn today and it made me absolutely cack. Fully. Last night we were talking about guitar picks, cos i said he should make one out of ben windles buisness card (its the coolest, double glazed card i have ever seen, good work windle) and yeah bryn goes...""yeah what I want to do is go into a music shop and look at all the pick and stand there choosing, and when the shop assistant asks what I want I'll say ""that one! its the PICK of the bunch.""..... haaaaaa haa. Oh man bryn is funny. And he makes me laugh all the time like when me and him and tom were making fun of the word of knowledge altar calls (sorry god) like :
PG: Theres someone here who is suffering from bad headaches. Its like a crown of thorns around your head....
BRYN: (impersonating grant) Yes, jesus I see that hand.
PG: Theres someone here and this means something to you... you're in a dark, room.
BRYN: Yes, its me, you see i have this new job in photography and its a killer.
TOM: (trying to be grant) I see theres someone here with a fear of altars.... anyone...anyone?
TOM: Theres someone here tonight who is unable to raise their hands, who is that one? come on.... quickly..... who is that? Nobody...?

Haa haaaa haaa. Bryn reckons elephants swim for recreation. I beg to differ. I believe animals dont do anything for recreation, because recreation is a made made contruct. People throw balls to dogs and go, ""yeah hes really doing this for fun""... someobdy takes their dog to the beach and says ""yeah this is what he does for fun"" I just dont think most animals have the cognitive capacity to distinguish between fun and survival. I mean they would most probably prefer playing to having a bath... running away to staying in an enclosure... food time as opposed to taking tablets. 

I agree that dolphins have sex for fun. Thats like scientifically proven. Its just that animals have no spirit, so they dont even know that theyre alive, let alone having the time of their...life??

What do my faithful readers think? I'd like to hear from some of you."

I also went to the gym this morning and there was a funny experience. I happened to be doing this circuit yesterday, like the one I always do, I make it up myself, and it was like this guy.... who is like about 40 something....real westender... was running like beside me during everything. It was purely coincidental- we were following each other to the ab roller, cardio machines, excersize ball... weights.... and yeah it was odd. Today, so I walk in and here he is on the BIKES (which i was intent on doing, stupid man) and I am like holy crap, dang... and we looked at each other, freakishly smiled and kept going with our lives. And we kinda did the same thing today. It freaked me out somewhat. But it was one of those cack experiences at the same time. 

Hope I dont see him tommorow... I so prefer to remain anonymous at the gym. I am no strings attached... I dont talk to strangers at the gym for fear of making a friend who will see how unco I am!

But in other news, Rose just emailed me to say Bella is coming Sunday night I am sooooo excited. I LOVE BELLA! OMG, sshes like awesome. She may not be awake by 8:30 but thats ok. 

Also, I am having a meeting today with Cheryl. I am nervously EXCITED!!!!!!!!!! I am actually like AHHHH. But Great Ahhh. Not bad. GOOD. 

I got to talk to Korninne lots last night. It was fun. Catching up with people from my past lately, has really got me thinking I have a fantastic life. Seems lots of people are quited bored with a monotonous life, and i think theres only one answer. If something's empty filling it with things that are only temporary wont fill it. It just doesnt cut it anymore. Like if youre hungry and eat lollies... your still hungry. But if you eat perhaps a footlong Roast Chicken or Teriyaki Sub, even six inch, you're filled. Parallel with that... theres only one answer for an empty life and that Jesus.

I am so happy with my life, what I do with it and i am having the time of my life these holidays. It just keeps on getting better... like apart from Nicky going away (which will be fantastic for her) I have got the most amzing friends around me. I am even making closer connections with other people lately, like kids parents and stuff. Tom finishes school on Friday which is exciting plus cos I just want him to always be at our house.... haha....i daresay with an invitation like that he will be. Hes the essence of fun. And I have so many more exciting things which I cannot disclose as yet. Things are going up... man, life is rockin. I have such an active spiritual, social, intellectual, physcial, mental ....... everything life. Nows just a time where its like a real good season. THANKYOU JESUS. I had this issue the other night with my car and my finances... and all i could do was sit under the stars on the boot of my car thanking God for all my awesome friends and support networks and the prosperity i have, and all the rockin things God has done in me... and i am convinced its only up from here. I have made a choice to live out of who I am rather than what has happened to me. Faith is never conditional on circumstances. Praise God when it doesnt feel like you should. When you wanna shake your fist at him and say, WHERE WERE YOU??? say, thanks for being there. When you're on your last $5, thank him for prosperity. Its awesome.

AHHHHHHHH... im lovin it. Viva la holidays. They can never be underrated."

I have spent much time writing this manual thing for Water baptisms for kids... its so interesting. Kids have so many ideas and you need to really get in their heads to write something for them about abstract principles. For example, if your sin gets washed away in the water will it still be in the water when i get out. And, does it mean I never sin again???

"event","This morning I woke up and had this urge to read through my old journals. It was so weird. I have kept them since I was about 14, but maily I wrote songs at that age. It is weird... in my day I have written some cool things. Like I had so much more talent for writing when I was not even into God. But thats because its not meant to be my thing YET. God has done such a number on my life I am like trippin out. I cant believe how far everything has come. I am so much more in control of everything, only because I have let God have it all. Just let it all hang out. 

Yesterday was an amazing day. Morning church was great. I wore a hat. Trucker hat ya know. Havent gone there before. I led praise and worship in kids church and it was really great. Ben is just so into it... hes just such an awesome kid. He and Alex are getting water baptized next week, I am thrilled. They were really hearing stuff from God yesterday which was awesome. I had this city kids meeting with bea and mannnnn things are movin. 

We saw the Clelands. I am in with Sophia hey. She likes me now, thats what an hour with her can do. Louis is like such a wheres wally, cutest baby. He is just adorable. I like them. Fiona is just such a cool woman. I know that when i have kids I am gonna ask her all about it. And Grant is a rocker. I love that family and I am so glad to know them and be building into their lives.

Lat night was great. The testimony night for the Lord Mayor. It was cool, there was a lot of surprising testimonies coming out of the church - not one wasnt one worth telling. Afterwards I asked the boys if they wanted to get baptised and they said yes, and I ran upstairs to praise and worship and was like ""YEEHAH!"". I went and told Tom and it was just cool. I went out with him to the Jazzy, he rode and beat me by like 10 minutes (ride like the wind (le) ) and it was cool. It was the weirdest night... we were sitting at this pseudo coupl-ly table where everything was kinda weird. There i realised stuff about my past and things in my future that will never colllide (another story entirely) ........ahhhh! But we had a great night. Tom told me many stories (he always does, i could just sit there and listen and he'd never run out) about being a hari krishna and how I would love this shop called beads and beads (!) and his bracelet that fell off when he was playing footy and he was so bummed (i could probably just make him a new one) it wasnt the TRCK WINDLE one it was this jamaican one...but he wears the other one every day, i never knew it would be such a success. Well only one week left of school 4 him and then we're gonna celabrate. 

Katie has a car and a lisence. Man i like her shes a dude. And Bryn. He is an awesome, most creative guy. He writes so amazingly. I have nothing but good things to say about bryn, i think he is amazing. Hes a talented fellow. Lets continue to praise bryns holy name. Haha. Nah seriously I am impressed by him. 

Nicky has gone overseas soon. I said seeya in two hours. I am gonna miss her, hello nichy when you read this... she is a cool person. I will miss her constant stalking. HAhA

I hung out with Rosabella a bit yesterday... i want Greek babies!!!!! ahhhhh.... she is so cute, so expressive just so.... CUTE."

"event","Last night I had this dream that I had a baby. It was really strange cos the dream started when I was in labour (usually 'i had a baby' dreams start when you have the baby) and the labour was in just a little room with just me and the midwife, who didnt really care very much that i was having a baby. There was no man there, and I was completely alone... I dont know how I got pregnant since I dont like have sex at the moment. But I was.

The labour was short and painless. And the midwife handed me this beautiful baby girl and it was just the most surreal experience (probably cos it was a dream) because she left the room and i was just there, with this baby thinking... how am I ever going to deal with this. Its a BABY for cryin out loud. Nobody visited us in hospital, so we just went home. To somewhere. And NOBODY cared that I had a baby. Nobody asked to hold her. Nobody acknowledged the fact I was a mum. No congratulations and no presents. I didnt know how to put her to sleep and I wanted to watch her to make sure she was still alive. So I asked my mum and she was like, ""You should have figured that out before this..."" and I am like thanks for nothing. 

Anyway. The dream was CRAAZY. I am still so disturbed about it. Its like the ultimate picture of what I dont want when I have a baby. (Although when I woke up I still wished I had that baby!!! i hate that you wake up from dreams where you have cool things and you get disappointed) Its like when I have a baby I want to be married, and have so much support and everything. Anyways, I am like so trippin by this dream.

I think the dream was just because I had hung out with lots of mums and babies yesterday. Rosabella and Isabella..... cutest ever. Rosabella makes the best faces. She has the most cutest expressions, I want a greek baby! Isabella is just the cutest. Shes got such a special place in my heart and life... some people just do. I have a connection with her. Shes awesome. Rosabella and I were playing yesterday, we were playing SUPERMAN and Jess rang and I answered the phone with a baby on my hip (dag) and Jess was talking and Rosie was hitting the phone and it was so funny. Its hard to make a nickname for rosabella. Its not Bella. Thats Isabella. Its not Rosa cos thats a old ladies name. It is actually Bella, but YOU CANT have 2 bellas. 

Apart from that my car is broken and my awesome BRO benny is coming around to fix it. He ROCKS."

"event","Dr Phil said today.... Bored people are BORING! Fully.  I agree.

I am having the best holiday. I have been doing so much kids stuff. Ministry that is. I am convinced cheryl has our number on Speed Dial. 

Today I did coffee (italian soda) and greek shortbread with Mrs Cindi Windle. She rocks. I like her a lot i think the woman is a very wise and fun piece of work. She got a job at COC as a dance teacher. That is SOOOOO COOOOOOOLLL. That has been her dream for like, how long?? and shes achieved it. Not without God. Awesome stuff. Its also very encouraging to see somebody reach what was once a dream. Excellent. She gave me some great encouragement some constructive criticism... no correction. But I am going to see Cheryl on Tuesday so I would say ill get lots of that then. I hope anyways. Its hard stuff doing this from scratch. I need some Godly helpers. 

I saw the most single disgusting thing today. A man crossing the road and PROJECTILE VOMITING. It wasnt like a bit of spew I am talking like HOW could that possibly be inside of him, spew. I had to look at him cos I was the first car and had to see if i could drive. There was simply no choice. 

Gross. Sound effects and all. I think I need a memory erase."

"event","I am listening to Homestar, like Marzipans answering Machine... and its suuuuuuuch a cack. I have had a lovely night at the Jane St House watching Australian Idol. I cant stand to be on my own for milestone events. I had to call bea and Jess so I could be with people at this time. Haha... ohhh fad shows always suck me in. For like that two weeks when they are cool. Man Guy is awesome. I think hes like just a cool cat, hes also so incredibly GOOD-LOOKING. 

I always think it looks amazing when dark or olive skinned people have blue and green eyes. I think that is such an amazing look on non white people. Perhaps even my favourite. So I think Guys eyes are a great point and him. And another part that gets me going, is a great smile and a good set of teeth. YYEEEHHAAHHH.... so all up I think hes like fully cute, without being one of those teenagers who think they actually WILL marry Guy cos they go there in their heads enough. I dont want to marry him, but I think visually hes got it going. Black (-ish in his case) guys always do. So good work mr sebastian, praise jesus. 

I hope he will get out there and win hearts for God hey. I just cant help to think, that as soon as teenage obsessions kick in they are gonna look for all his previous work and find planet shaker... which would be a trippy experience for the uninitiated.

Speaking of which- A CURRENT AFFAIR- tonite had this pastor of this pento church on and man, they made the church look so cult like.... I mean even the wicca guy (head of the pagan society... what daa....??) looked more un-suss than the church. They filmed people praying in tongues and wrshipping (which I totally agree that ""filming spiritual breakthrough is like porn, it should never be done"".... BRYN CHAINEY...) its just too personal, too intamite to ever hope to be explained easily on ACA. Its such a flipped out process to understand the ways of God, and who even does??? if we understood God we would be God, man.... trippin. 

I love that Stacie Oricco and Guy Sebastian are out there influencing this world for God. That just rocks."

"event","I have had a really good motivational day. Like when you wake up and realise someone is using the bathroom so you need to occupy yourself so you dont wee. And in that time, i began to clean frantically and write evil narky notes to my flatmates about things, Cheryl could come any day now. Seriously guys.

Nicky has been over here for like a million times lately. It has been so exciting, cos I just dont get sick of her. Its really came out of nowhere, well really because shes leaving soon, that me and her have been like joined at the hip (sid sidebottom)and its been fun. I hope that one day next year in March I can live with her. The only problem is that its going to be a rather expensive venture. Between us we havent got much resources... and bonds and stuff like that cost MUCH! But GOD is my warrior.... he lives where streets are paved in Gold and if its meant to be, then it will be. I really hope so but I will so understand if its not.  I could deal with living here longer... this is an almost perfect arrangement. Except of course for the nutters and the construction. I really love living here. Its been my fully like, growing ground. I was gonna say breeding ground but I havent got any kids yet. (of my own) But man my life has changed in this house. Its great. 

Overall I am really happy with everything. I am making these posters and I have some ministry work that has to be done."

"event","I just dont get life sometimes. As tacky and cliche as it is I am having the weirdest time just living. I am a bit confused about lots of things and rolling with the punches about everything else. Whats really good is I got an email from Beatrice rebecca tonight and she had some really cool stuff to say. I emailed Cheryl about all kids church stuff, kinda not knowing what to say or how to say why I was even writing it but I did. I hope it was the right stuff to say and I hope it wasnt too long. I have the long email fear. Bea undertstands. 

I am having a really weird time. Its like, sometimes with people (not at liberty to say who, nobody aforementioned, or nobody youd expect)  you think oh I cant stand the way you do that or i hate it that you arent here.... and its like, good old stacie orrico for putting it in a song ""I hate you, but I love you"" (i cant stop thinking of you, its true, I'm stuck on you...) I know that fully you can hate someones absolute GUTS and want to vomit at the sight of them, but you only do because you love them to death and theyve let you down. And you never really hated them in the first place.  

The problem is, you've placed too much of an expectation on them to be somebody unrealistic. If the person you wish they were existed, youd probably get so sick of them and go, man... cant you like... be unperfect. The perfect person just doesnt exist Im afraid. And the sooner I realise that the better cos then i will stop putting these expectations on people and just accept them for who they are and who God wants them to be at this point in time. The perfect person doesnt exist because people arent meant to be perfect. If IM not perfect, why do I expect somebody who is to come to my rescue???? I know everyones out looking for a saviour, and Ive found mine. Jesus is the only way to happiness, and to emotional freedom. Not to mention the only way to live life and heaven. Man, I am so glad to have found him. I'd seriously be dead without him. 

Jesus, you mean everything to me. You are my everlasting, everloving. I cant imagine life without God, nor can I really remember life before God. I lived 16 years of it, but I cant remember what it felt like, because its so far removed from what I am and who I am now. Theres just no substitute for sitting at the feet of jesus and pouring you life, your heart and you soul out before him. Its the only place where you find your true identity. Id be stuffed if I know who I am if I didnt find it all in the mirror of Gods word. I was the third child of my parents, i thought. Turned out I wasnt even that.  I was some random fourth with an even randomer indian sister who was 11 years older than me. Go figure. I dont know a person who wouldnt have found their feet in life apart from God. I honestly dont know how my parents have lived their lives without having to lean on him. It doesnt make them weaker to give in their lives to the big guy.

Jody and Yannicks wedding was on saturday. Its not like I went or anything or even know them much, but it sounded really beautiful.(I absoluetly love laura kato) Im starting to like the sound of a day reception... YIOW! I cant wait for my wedding day. Its so guitars coming from me, I know, but I just want there to be one day where I look incredibly femininely beautiful, and to just blow my prospective husband away. Its not like i want to look like a different person. I want to still look amy-like but a really really unbelivably GOOD-LOOKING version. Haha. (hey make up cant do miracles)I do think I will cry though. It will be quite overwhelming to think that I have been waiting this long for him, and then there it is, like my WEDDING day. Fully wow. 

Theres a hearty update since i havent for ages."

I went to work today. I felt like absolute crap all day but i didnt tell dean cos I dont want to be the girl who is sick all the time.  It might have had something to do with eating cake for breakfast. I felt like at any moment I could have hurled. Quite chunderous actually. 

Tonite is Caros BBQ. Shes going back to New Zealand to live. man, I am going to miss her. Shes such a champ. GO CARO GO! She will probably be at the olympics maybe and I can just watch her on TV. 

I am hanging out with Connor my homeboy tommorow. I am very excited. I hope it is really sunny and I can take him to the park. Theres much jumping on the bed to be done. I am so excited to be able to have time to do pastorial care and visits lately. man, two families in a week, YEAH! I mean, I aim to go to their houses, so I can be in their home environment (therefore most comfortable) but where I cant its just so special to hang out and play with the kids. I love that I can take a whole day off work to play with a three year old! Me and Connor have much jumping on the bed to be done. I cant wait until cooper is big enough to play with us. Hes chargin though, I just got an email... he wont be coming home until he can regulate his own body temperature and is 2kg. Go Coops. 

I played with Phia and Louie the other day. Oh  They are soooo cute. I love Phia... SOOOOOOO PHIA. Sophia. I accidently (haha) put Sophias nappy on Louis and Louis's nappy on Sophia. This turned out as Louis having this massive nappy on and Sophia saying , ""Louis's..."" and ""TIGHT! TIGHT!"" Then I went, ahhh man, where can I find a sophia size nappy and stealing a dodgy creche one. 

Sunday is katy's birthday party! (Man that is like 3 visits in a week, how sweet is that)... i am SOO excited. Its hot dogs, swimming and dancing party. I love the randomness. I love katy... I cant believe shes seven already. I met Katy when she was 4... this little girl with a Madeline haircut. She HATED me. She didnt want a bar of me. I remember I used to get to church early because I knew her and sam would be there and I wanted to hang out with them. They were so little. Sammy didnt even have glasses yet. I bribed them into liking me with lollies.... haha. I would make balloon animals for Katy and she would jump on them. I was like... *shakes fist*. But man, I cant believe the progress we've made! Last year on her Christmas card to me katy said I was her very best friend. We have hung out on many occaisions and she used to even call me just to talk, when she was about 5. Now she loves me, I can tell, and I love her so much. She is like the coolest kid. I get her so much. And sammy, what can I say the boy is a genius. He knows maths like you wouldnt believe. He is not so gifted in creativity, but check out his maths. He does algebra. He is 9! Wow. Those Roubin kids are hilarious. I love every minute i spend with them. I love how sam calls me AMY FITZGERALD every time he sees me. 

I have rediscovered the coolest pants ever. I mean cool cos of comfort wise. Theyre kinda west-endy... like fisherman, hippie pants. Comfy though.

I watched dirty dancing yesterday HAAAAHAAAA. Man how inapropriate is it for kids! Me and my friend courtney (who was 5, I was 7) used to watch it and do dancing from it. Not like pump and grind manouvres, i mean more like skirt swishing. My sister megs, used to say, LOVERBOY, Come here LOVERBOY! haa haaa isnt that a cack. One time she said it and the boy she liked walked past. She nearly died of embarrasment. But it was like our favourite film. Haha.  I thought a lot about the temporal nature of sex and relationships in that movie. Like, I am so not ever going to give up on the dream that my relationship with my husband will be forever. I dont understand having sex, and having the guy just walk away. No way.... Or when people dance like, dirty, and they dont like... LIKE, the guy. I think I would have to be married to dance like that. Its not like you could dance that close and look into a guys eyes without wanting to have sex with him. Seriously. I think thats a lie. You can so tell in the movie though that whenever they dance that close theres this like, chemistry and these sparks, where if it was real life they would leave the dancefloor and shag. 

Seriously guys. Dont dirty dance unless you realise the temptation you are putting yourself through. (amys pearls)"

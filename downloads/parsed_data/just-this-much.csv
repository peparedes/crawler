Hummingbird--Wilco

His goal in life was to be an echo 
Riding alone, town after town, toll after toll 
A fixed bayonet through the great southwest to forget her 

She appears in his dreams 
But in his car and in his arms 
A dream can mean anything 
A cheap sunset on a television set can upset her 
But he never could 

Remember to remember me 
Standing still in your past 
Floating fast like a hummingbird 

His goal in life was to be an echo 
Tap the sound of folks around and then back down 
Like a feather 
But in the deep chrome canyons of the loudest Manhattans 
No one could hear him 
Or anything 

So he slept on a mountain 
In a sleeping bag underneath the stars 
He would lie awake and count them 
And the gray fountain spray of the great Milky Way 
Would never let him 
Die alone 

Remember to remember me 
Standing still in your past 
Floating fast like a hummingbird 

Remember to remember me 
Standing still in your past 
Floating fast like a hummingbird

  	If you had come away with me
into another state
we had been quiet together.
But there the sun coming up
out of the nothing beyond the lake was
too low in the sky,
there was too great a pushing
against him,
too much of sumac buds, pink
in the head
with the clear gum upon them,
too many opening hearts of lilac leaves,
too many, too many swollen
limp poplar tassels on the
bare branches!
It was too strong in the air.
I had no rest against that
springtime!
The pounding of the hoofs on the
raw sods
stayed with me half through the night.
I awoke smiling but tired.

Woke up this morning at 11:11
Wasn't in Portland and I wasn't in heaven
Could have been either by the way I was feeling
But I was alive, I was alive
Woke up this morning at 11:11
John was half-naked and Lulu was crying
Over a baby that will never go crazy
But I was alive
And kicking through this cruel world
Holding a notion of you at 11:11
Tell me what else can I do
What else can I do?
Woke up this morning and something was burning
Realized that everything really does
Happen in Manhattan
Thoughts were of characters and afternoons lying
And you, you were alive
Oh the house we are seperate
11:11 is just precious time we've wasted
So patch up your bleeding hearts
And put away your posies
I'm gonna have a drink
Before we ring around the rosies with you"

is you.  I need you.

I don't know who I am anymore
the face is familiar but the eyes,
the eyes give it all away..

Ashes of American Flags--Wilco

the cash machine
is blue and green
for a hundred in twenties
and a small service fee
I could spend three dollars
and sixty-three cents
on diet coca-cola
and unlit cigerettes

I wonder why
we listen to poets
when nobody gives a fuck
how hot and sorrowful
this machine begs for luck
all my lies are always wishes

I know I would die
if I could come back new

I want a good life
with a nose for things
a fesh wind and bright sky
to enjoy my suffering
a hole without a key
if I break my tongue
speaking of tomorrow
how will it ever come
all my lies are always my wishes

I know I would die
if I could come back new

I'm down on my hands and knees
every time the doorbell rings
I shake like a toothache
when I hear myself sing
all my lies are only wishes

I know I would die
if I could come back new

I would like to salute
the ashes of American flags
and all the falling leaves 
filling up shopping bags"

Sometimes I think that I know 
What love's all about 
And when I see the light 
I know I'll be all right. 

I've got my friends in the world, 
I had my friends 
When we were boys and girls 
And the secrets came unfurled. 

City of brotherly love 
Place I call home 
Don't turn your back on me 
I don't want to be alone 
Love lasts forever. 

Someone is talking to me, 
Calling my name 
Tell me I'm not to blame 
I won't be ashamed of love. 

Philadelphia, 
City of brotherly love. 
Brotherly love. 

Sometimes I think that I know 
What love's all about 
And when I see the light 
I know I'll be all right. 
Philadelphia."

I heard all your reasons
I heard all your plans
I have seen the seasons
Clutched up in your hands
You're the one eyed feather
You're the lion's mane
Swear you've heard the weather
Calling out your name
There'll be no more winters
There'll be no more spring and
There'll be no more dinner bells
Left for you to ring
There'll be no more dinner bells
Dinner bells to ring
Maestro learns the music
Musicians learn to dance
There'll be no more trumpets
There'll be no more flutes
No more clapping hands
I've heard all your reasons
I've heard all your plans
I heard of your treasons
and I've heard all your pleas
And i've made friends with the hang man
So there'll be no more winter
There'll be no more spring and
There'll be no more dinner bells
Left for you to ring
There'll be no more dinner bells
Dinner bells to ring
There'll be no more dinner bells

"event","So my sister recently pointed out my obsession with mellow music.  At first I laughed it off and denied it.  But the more I think about it, the more I realize how much mellow and slow paced music I listen to.  Elliot and Sufjan to name a few.  And it's weird that I listen to such mellow music because often I am a very hyperactive person.  often annoyingly hyperactive.

Maybe I like mellow music so much because it comforts me.  You see, I'm often very uncomfortable when I'm feeling hyperactive.  I wish I could calm down, but I can't.  being hyperactive makes me seem much less mature than I think I really am.  I guess mellow music just soothes my spirit.

A cold and wet November dawn 
and there are no barking sparrows 
just emptiness to dwell upon.

I fell into a winter slide 
and ended up the kind of kid who goes down chutes too narrow 
just eking out my measly pies.

But I learned fast how to keep my head up 'cause I 
know there is this side of me that 
wants to grab the yoke from the pilot and just
fly the whole mess into the sea.

Another slow train to the coast 
some brand new gory art from way on high 
I sink and then I swim all night. 

I watch the ice melt on the glass 
while the eloquent young pilgrims pass 
and leave behind their trail 
imploring us all not to fail.

Of course I was raised to gather courage from those 
lofty tales so tried and true and 
if you're able I'd suggest it 'cause this 
modern thought can get the best of you.

This rather simple epitaph can save your hide your falling mind 
fate isn't what we're up against there's no design no flaws to find

I'll be the grapes fermented, bottled and
served with the table set in my finest suit
like a perfect gentleman.
I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the 
ancient brick where you will sit and
contemplate your day.

I'll be the waterwings that save you if you
start drowning in an open tab when your
judgement's on the brink.
I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite
albums back as your lying there drifting off
to sleep.
I'll be the platform shoes and undo what
heredity's done to you: you won't have to
strain to look into my eyes.
I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zipped
straight to the throat with the collar up so
you won't catch cold.

I want to take you far away from the cynics in this
town and kiss you on the mouth.
we'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of
this scene, start a brand new colony
where everything will change, we'll give
ourselves new names, identities erased.
the sun will heat the grounds under our bare
feet in this brand new colony.

everything will change..."

"event","I believe in Symmetry--Bright Eyes

Some plans were made and rice was thrown. 
A house was built; a baby born. 
How time can move both fast 
and slow amazes me. 
And so I raise my glass to symmetry
...to the second hand and its accuracy...
to the actual size of everything 
the desert is the sand. 

You can't hold it in your hand. 
It won't bow to your demands. 
There's no difference you can make.
 There's no difference you can make... 
And if it seems like an accident 
a collage of senselessness 
you weren't looking hard enough. 
I wasn't looking hard enough at it

An argument for consciousness, 
the instinct of the blind insect w
ho makes love to the flowerbed and dies in the first freeze. Oh, I want to learn such simple things... 
the politics 
no, history so what i want and 
what i need can finally be the same. 

I just got myself to blame...
leave everything up to fate 
when there's choices I can make...
when there's choices I can make. 
Now my heart needs a polygraph...always eager to pack my bags when I really wanna stay...when I really wanna stay...when I wanna stay. 

The arc of time - the stench of sex... 
The innocence you can't protect - each quarter note,
 each marble step... 
Walk up and down that lonely treble clef. 
Each one and the next one to arrive. 

The argument for consciousness, 
the instinct of the blind insect 
who never thinks not to accept it's faith...that's faith...
There's happiness in death. 
You give to the next one. 
You give to the next on down the line.
The levity of longing that instills each dream
inside my head...my morning water 
down forget on silver stars, i wish and wish
and wish from one to the next one...
from one to the next right down the line. 
You give to the next one. 
You give to the next on down the line."

No Name #3--Elliott Smith

we arrived too late 
our mouths were opening, I turned off the light 
so come on night 

you're a witness you 
you've see me interrupt good old fashioned fight 
so come on night 

everyone is gone 
home to oblivion 
home to oblivion 
home to oblivion 

watched the dying day 
blushing in the sky 
everyone is uptight 
so come on night 

everyone is gone

aspects of my life, I can't help but feeling somewhat lost and
bored.&nbsp; I feel quite directionless.&nbsp; I feel like i've been
stuck on the same track for 4 years.&nbsp; Nothing has really
changed.&nbsp; Sure there have been a few minor adjustments here and
there, but really what the hell is going on in this town?&nbsp;
Absolutely nothing.&nbsp; Even the exciting stories that people tell on
the weekend that I may or may not have been a part of, are really
nothing.&nbsp; I'm not unhappy or sad, I'm just tired ans ready for
something new.&nbsp; Though I must say, this year has alot in store for
me--Biloxi, Paris, Italy, Graduation, etc.&nbsp; So hopefully those
good things on the horizon approach quicker than I expect them to.</font><br>"

in the lonely streets.
and it's only me to see it.
so i remember the red lights that turn green
and the blinker that knows where i'm going but not where i've been.
and i recall the reason
for this journey tonight
i recall the reason,
and follow my headlights.

'twas a good night tonight.

"" When you first arrive in a new city, nothing makes sense. Everythings unknown, virgin... After you've lived here, walked these streets, you'll know them inside out. You'll know these people. Once you've lived here, crossed this street 10, 20, 1000 times... it'll belong to you because you've lived there. That was about to happen to me, but I didn't know it yet. ""

""music superiority
I hate people who think that the music that they like is superior to others. Sure, I'm not a rap fan, but that doesn't mean my music preference is better than that. So next time someone says that they like a song that you don't, don't say ""i ahte this song, it sucks. why do you like this song?"" Just say... well don't say anything. Just silently disagree.""

i think we an all agree that i don't silently disagree about anything.  i'm very vocal."

"event","I'd go into the details and tell you all why this day ahs been so much fun, but im lazy and tired.  so you lose. snow is pretty. my house is pretty when it's covered in snow.  my dog is pretty when she runs through the snow and gets it all over her back and then shakes it off in my  face and all over the floor, so that when i take off my boots my socks get wet which makes my feet cold.  i hate cold feet. it's the worset thing about the winter.    the week ahead is going to be very interesting. potentially devastatting.  im curious to see who got what parts in the musical.  im curious to see who got into what colleges.  i hope skidmore likes me.  that would make my life so much easier.  i wonder if i should get a laptop or a pc for college.  any thoughts/opinions/feelings about this subject?  do tell me them.

could our snowman today be symbolic of things to come for this frosty the snowman?

kids used to sing that song to me all the time.  you'd think i'd hate it by now, but i really have no opinion about it.  it's jsut another song to me.  i really have no subconscious psychological connection with the song.


the end goodbye much love.

stir it up."

"event","The World At Large--Modest Mouse

Ice-age heat wave, can't complain 
If the world's at large, why should I remain? 
Walked away to another plan. 
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand 

I move on to another day, to a whole new town with a whole new way 
Went to the porch to have a thought 
Got to the door again, I couldn't stop 

You don't know where and you don't know when 
But you still got your words and you got your friends 
Walk along to another day 
Work a little harder, work another way 

Well uh-uh baby I ain't got no plan 
We'll float on maybe would you understand? 
Gonna float on maybe would you understand? 
We'll float on baby would you understand? 

The days get shorter and the nights get cold 
I like the autumn but this place is getting old 
I pack up my belongings and head for the coast 
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most 

The days get longer and the nights smell green 
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave 

I like songs about drifters-books about the same 
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane 
Walked off onto another spot 
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want 

Did I want love? Did I need to know? 
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow? 

The moths beat themselves to death against the lights 
Adding their breeze to the summer nights 
Outside, water like air was great 
I didn't know what I had that day 

Walk a little farther to another plan 
You said that you did, but you didn't understand 

I know that starting over is not what life's about 
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth 
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth 
My thoughts were so loud"

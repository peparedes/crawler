BUT MOST importantly! mr barat hates me and never appreciated me. i gave all i could to the band and my section this year and he told me that i was selfish the whole year. i just dont understand. like all the things that he said to me, HOW CAN A TEACHER SAY THAT TO A STUDENT???? i thought that i had done atlest one thing right this year but i guess not. wanting to do other things just made me selfish i guess. but i guess then im not the only selfish one in band. WHATEVER! ill be so much happier next year, and ill def enjoy my senior year. ill get to hang with new friends that i havent hung out with in forever and a day too! me and kristin and megan are gonna go hang out fri night and i think me and audrey are gonna hang out on sat! so im excited. i miss those girls. im gonna miss band and all the fun i had but it wasnt worth it. i was like getting verbally abused WAY too much! so i was upset about it and everything but my dad has been so awesome through all of this. weve gotten really close. i dont know what i would do without him. probably die! im so excited about the stuff i get to do now...i get to go to fiji island this yr and diana really wants me to go to gator growl and then powder puff and everything else. bdtv is gonna be so much fun next yr too. i dont know why i stuck it for so long. ill miss it but i dont regret my decision and im glad i made the choice i did. ANYWAYS!
     We had to do our jr project presentations this morning and mine went pretty good. so english was easy. me and audrey like totally caught up on like everything thats been happening this yr. i miss hanging out with her. we both want to go to fsu or unf so if we get into the same college we were talking abuot prob rooming together or something which would be awesome. i want to know someone when i leave. atleast one person. lol my dad wants me to go to unf isntead of fsu so im closer to home. not that much closer, but closer. he just wants to be able to come visit and if i have a problem, that he can be there in a few hrs not 5 or 6. which is understandable. im getting so excited about college and sr yr. i cant wait. i just want it to be here. well sr yr is basically here lol! my mom wants me to stay at pcc but there is NO way! im ready to get out of here meet new people and i want to join a sorority and actually have the college life. and so when i come home to visit, its an enjoyable visit. but i think im gonna go take another nap or something or study for my finals next week."

"event","So things have been basically either chilled, stessful, busy, drama drama drama, school work, or tired as anything. so phil, andrew, and steph are all home from college for the rest of the summer which is cool. i just want my summer to come. IM SO READY TO WORK! its sad that im excited about that, but i love my job. i dont really care if i have to work with nicole i can be mature and tollerate her. im out of her and dougs business b/c it seems like people are out to get me, telling me stuff that they want me to tell him. WHATEVER I DONT CARE ANYMORE! enough about them....anyways so SUMMER...its going to be awesome. were all going to go out to venice sometime soon YAY! i can not wait. and then the beach etc etc. may 20th could not be here any sooner. so anyways theres all this band drama going on as usual, i swear it just gets old. im trying to stay out of it, but drama loves me. i used to be drama-free now look at me. i think thats why im always so stressed out. i cant wait to get out of this little town and go like 5hrs away lol. but senior year will hopefully be awesome. this year has been really tuff on me. ive been through alot. im a stronger person yes but its not been fun! AT ALL but i also had some awesome things happens, like dream girl and tri-state and stuff! which was awesome true true. and ive gained alot of great friends, but i kind of drifted from some too. me and liz and me and kt became really good friends. they are two great girls. liz trips me out and we always have such a blast together. and kt is the best person ever like she would kill someone for me lol! and me and ben got really close this yr. hes really been someone ive always been able to call and to lean on with all the things that have ive had happen this yr. asliegh and i got really close too. we have alot in common and have the same sense of humor. its so weird, we can talk like non stop for hours to each other. and me and chelsy got close this yr too. ive renunited with alot of old friends too. like carissa and jill. like me and jill got a lot closer bc this time last yr we werent talking bc of someone ahem! but we couldnt be better. were even talking right now lol. ive mised all of them, and when i look back on this yr its just been a ginormous rollar coaster. i wouldnt have changed most of my memories for anything in the world. they were so priceless, but some i would most def change in a heart beat lol"

"event","ok this has been one of the worst weekends that i have had in a really LONG time. fri i told doug about nicole and of corse he didnt believe me again but im tired of looking out for him because he NEVER believes me. He always believes her. i was just telling him what i had been told, i wasnt just telling him to break them up. thats STUPID! i have better things to do. but atleast my friends were comforting about everything. but i just dont understand doug, because he said that she wasnt ever gonna find out that it was me that told him. but after i talked to someone i got told that that wasnt the only time that that all happened. but im not going to tell him because he never believes me or anyone else over her for that matter. he can do whatever he wants.
ANYWAYS! well besides all that friday night was still horrible. i just realized im not the only one that doesnt care much for her anymore. but mike and daniel and ben came over and we all just talked and hung out and talked abuot whats been going on. everything has just been crazy drama drama drama! so they all left, but i dont remember what time because i passed out on the couch. but i woke up around midnight 30, and tried to call someone. and of corse since it was the weekend they didnt pick up. and the excuse is always that they left their phone some where. im just really tired of that. i needed someone to talk to fri night and they werent EVEN THERE!  so then i had to go to a wedding yesterday. it wasnt that bad in the beginning. alicia looked SO GORGEOUS! i really hope that her and my uncle are going to be very happy. the ceremony was simple and nice (theyre both getting married for the 2nd time). the reception was kind of a joke at first. we get there and its all of alicia's side of the family and friends sitting down at ALL the tables. THERE WASNT ONE FOR ANY OF US!!!!!! so we tell someone and they said they were going to get 2 tables. well they put us in the corner with 12 people at a table. it was alright to begin with because we were right by the food and everything and we had 2 of my uncles that are FUCKING hilarious drunks. ones spleenless and the other was getting us champagne the WHOLE night lol. my mom didnt care! i loved it. anyways so then my cousin steph left to go hang out with milo and then it kind of started to suck because im around a bunch of drunk adults and like nothing to do. so i tried calling you know who again. and of corse he wasnt there as usual. it was a sat night and he was drinking! of corse!!! im just really irritated by him right now. and whenever i talk to him today , if i even talk to him today, there is going to be alot said by me! but i have to go do my chemistry project which just leaves icing on the cake for the worst weekend!"

"event","These past couple months have just kind of felt like one big blur! there's been some lows and some HUGE HIGHS lately and they all just kind of feel like a distant memory. everyone was just here for christmas break and now it's already 2 months later, dream girl has already passed, and now my birthday is right around the corner and then the Indianapolis trip and Prom are going to be here before I know it. I'm so glad that things are so busy though because it doesn't really leave me anytime to get into MAJOR trouble or just sit around and be lazy. Like this past week i was getting home from school after 6 (after being gone all day) or comming home for like an hour then to practice and not getting home till 9 or 10. then having to do homework and study my butt off, which kind of didn't go so well because i always seemed to fall asleep. friday i found out that i am officilly off acutane!!!!!!! FINALLY! this has been a hard past 5 months with everything that's happened. hah I look back on when i started it in August, and SO many things are different are now. sometimes i wish things wouldn't and things would stay the same and no one would get hurt or anything, but then somethings would never have happened if nothing ever changed. man, typing this is kind of making me sad. i feel like some of me and my friends are just drifting apart AND I HATE THAT! but then there's some that we're getting closer and some that we're reuniting...well kind of. last night was the first night since, wow i don't know, awhile since we'd really hung out. i forgot how much fun we always had together, and just didn't really have to do anything to laugh lol. valentine's day is comming up and yet again it sucks! i just want to be able to go out on a date with my boyfriend on valentine's day (or a my valentine). it never seems to work out for me as usual.
the plus with everything lately was that my parents (i know) FIANLLY have been so proud of me. seeing my mom and dad's faces on wed. made me feel so special, because they were just thinking THAT'S MY DAUGHTER! when i got home from outback that night they had also practically gone down the phone book and called everyone we knew to tell them the great news. let's just say things in winter haven travel VERY fast. people i don't even know, know who i am now. the downfall is people you don't even know or people you thought that were your friends talk shit about you, because you won, or they're jealous. people like that just really piss me off."

AND DONT DRIVE AWAY WHEN THEY HAVE A HUGE ASS BRIGHT ORANGE CONE!!! so if you get the drift i hoped out of jc big ass truck and get this huge cone like half the size of me and once i turned around jc was speeding away with out me. lol i didnt really care b/c i knew hed come back, plus if anyone saw me id just throw it down HAH RANDOM CONE! i mean construction DUH! lol so he came back and i barely made it into the bed of the truck but i did! so we went back to my house and i cleaned it lol so i could put it in my room. its my new thing people are going to sign it...good idea i know. then i realized i got grease or dirt or something ALL OVER MY PANTS so me and jc were trying to get it out when my parents came home. lol but they didnt care. so i went and through some shorts on (not so bright considering it was FREEZING!) and we see another cone so me the idiot i am i hop out again and steal that one for jc! lol but i realized when i got in the truck and we were speeding away lol that it was sticking straight up in the back so i had to open that little window thing and go out and lay it down lol. CRAZINESS I LOVE IT! that was pretty much the jist and fun on sat night. then sunday was busines! i woke up went to church, then had to go help write out the part for zach for dream girl, go to ben's and get help doing chem, then go to jills help her with chem, then i was finally home and then i got to practice. fun fun! monday was kind of just normal nothing exciting O BUT WAIT, me and jc went to the gym mon night and after that we went and stole like 10 cones lol. i told you im a steal-a-cone-aholic. tues we learned part of the dance for dream girl (its cute, mrs mizzel said i can shake my hips. lol which is true lol) and i was exhausted by the time i got home b.c i wasnt really home till 8:30. then today was kind of mellow worked on my solo and now im here. fun times i guess. just kind of bored but hey i can alawys go steal a cone! lol"

I feel like the only people I can turn to (that live here) that are always there are Jill and Ben and JC. Every time I call them they're there. And they still invite me to go do stuff. I've just felt really bummed out that past week or so and I don't really know why. I'm really confused about something and between my dad and my mom I feel like I'm always being yelled at by them. And I HATE broken promises, and telling me they'll do something and they don't! I really want to get out of this house and move. I need a change, maybe a little excitment will come to that. People will want to come over then. Atleast I'm not feeling as sick as I was. I'm pretty much over that. Hopefully today will be better than yesterday and things will get back to normal."

I wish I could just stay better for more than a few days! I hate being contageous and germy. So back to today. I had a final in Pre-Cal and it wasn't too bad. But Mrs. Calvo was being a bitch again. That lady just drives me nuts like ALL the time. After school I drove to Lakeland HS again to find out that Mr. Adams wasn't there and he's gone. Thanks for letting me know. So I have to find a new teacher and stuff before I have to take my solo to Districts. When I came home my dad decided to be a jerk and speak his mind. Saying that I'm good enough to win Dream Girl and I wouldn't eve come close. Way to boost your daughter's self esteem.

I didn't really want to go b/c I felt like crap but I did want to go anyways. I met Ben and Jill's friends, OMG some of them are so HILARIOUS! Alright so Ben picked me up b/c I didn't want to drive cuz I didn't feel all that well. We went and picked up some people and the dude (I just called him a Duche Bag when we got out of there) told the girls that my name was Tiffany. So they got in the car and were just like HI TIFFANY, and I never looked back....lol so I turned around finally and said who the hell is Tiffany? And they said OOPS I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU! lol So we get up there and this place is backed like a gay man's A-Hole gettin it! These old people started like freaking out b/c Rahonda started talking about child pornogrophy. lol It feels like we're waiting there forever and they just kept telling us 15mins, we start to get a lil tiffed. Nicole comes over and said that we were next THANK GOD! Otherwise we were gonna kill a bitch. So we sit down and it got so much worse! lol It took everyone forever to order and they decided they wanted cherries with their damn Shirley Temples lol. Our waitress was so awesomely nice, she def but up with us. (She got big tip dont wry) So we were cracking jokes and stuff and we told them it was my birthday. I felt kind of bad b/c they went to go find people to sing to me. lol So Rahonda hit on EVERYONE that was there practically. She was yelling at the bus boys, guys that randomly walked by, waitresses...she grabbed her lil apron thing lol. She was going to try to untie it lol. There were so many other things but it would take me ALL night to type this lol. Let's just say my stomach hurts so bad from laughing my ass off."

This week I think people were out to get me or something. I've had 3 people in a week almost hit me. Today was the closest, and of corse it was a huge truck. I was shaking when I walked into Shack's. A few of us went there after school and it was cool just to talk about things that have been happening. My birthday is like right around the corner and I can not wait. Yeah I know being 17 is nothing special but HEY SHUT UP I'm that much closer to being 18 and out of the Haven! Plus we'll finally be moved in. I'm getting so excited. Plus there's alot of people that said they'd help, which will help everything go that much faster. So I think that Sat. night before my birthday I think I'll just have people over to eat, play pool, and do whatever in the new house. I can not wait!! Then after my birthday is Prom. I really want to go but then I kind of don't want to. Justb/c homecoming sucked so much this yr that I'm scrared that they're going to screw this up too. But I doubt it b/c it's @ Gaylord Palms. How bad ass? I just hope someone will go with me and I'll look pretty. I'm so glad tomorrow is Friday. I need this weekend to study and sleep. I hate still being sick, it like never goes away.

BUT OF CORSE, it'll be shorter b/c of MAKE UP DAYS!

I was really scared before I was going over there but it all kind of just faded away when we started talking. I think it's b/c I didn't really know how he was feeling or what I was going to say. But in the end it I think we both felt SO much BETTER about everything. New Year's Eve was kind of boring. I went to Carissa's party and we hung out and watched Dawn of the Dead (wierd ass movie all i gotta say!). We counted down and I finally got to kiss someone at midnight. Mike and Steph both called me after midnight which was sooo sweet. TOTALLY MISS THAT GIRL LIKE HELL!!!!! So then Phil took me home around 1 or so and I went to bed. Yesterday I started on my school work that I was suppose to do over break. OMG I'm STILL doig my stupid spanish picture thingy. Good thing it's due on Thursday. I needed a break so here I am lol. I just can't wait till everything that's comming up but I have to work my ass off on my solo.

Why cant every guy be like Clark Kent? lol love that boy. So i just hung out with the fam and stuff the next couple days. then matt came into to town on tues which was so sweet. it was alot of fun. that was the night before steph left. she came over that night and we talked and talked and talked which was so awesome. i miss that so much. just her being able to talk to her face to face and just knowing someone cares and everything. she didnt leave until after 2 am. lol but it was just really good to talk about everything thats happened and what were going to do this semester. i miss that girl already! so yesterday i went shopping with my mom not TOO exciting, and then last night me heather and ben with to bucky's and played games. lol it was fun tho. and now today i have errands to go and do and clean the house but im just so lazy lol. and i still have to practice and do a spanish project. then after phil gets off work were gonna go and talk. im actually scared. i have a million things that have been going through my head. i dont really know where to start with anything/everything, but i dont want him going back like this. i just try and find the best in people. thats what my aunt said, and it could be something bad and thats prob why i get hurt so much. but i cant help it."

I past out that night having a few too many lol and my buddy Matt came over and had a conversation with me. LMAO Haha good times. Can't believe I never woke up for that one. So then the next day we had to get ready for Tri-State, which started out as kind of a disaster but turned out cool when I hung out with this girl Ashley that was in my band. Then that's when everything started to turn to CRAP! That Saturday night Heather tells me some useful info that I wish I would have found out sooner, but hey atleast I did, that my best friend and the best boyfriend I ever had (So I thought) the one I thought I was falling for, cheated on me. So the past few weeks we were trying to make things good again b/c things were so amazing between us, but he claims he just wanted to be stupid in college and do what he wants and not have to worry about hurting me or screwing up. YEAH......7months together and that's what I get for being ""The best girlfriend EVER"" so I was told. WHATEVER! So we broke up Monday night and came home thought I was gonna be more upset that what I was but I'm still out having fun, flirting!, and eating as normal. If I was the best don't you think I should have been treated that way? I'm over it. Why should he deserve me? Getting to the good parts...I've gotten to hang out with Jill and Steph alot, since I haven't in a while. We went out for Jill's b-day last night SO MUCH FUN! We went to Mikasa's and had the Japanese cook that had a REDNECK belt buckle! He was so hilarious! Then they dared me to run into Planned Parenthood and grab some condoms and run out so....I DID LOL! Then we did some Chinese firdrills..def dove into into the car while it was moving and landed ontop of Steph. GREAT TIMES. Then I came home and passed out b/c I had school today....SO BORING!"

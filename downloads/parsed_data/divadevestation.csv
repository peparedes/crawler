Why do relationships frustrate me so much? I can't understand it, this feeling that no one has yet possessed the same capacity for feeling and emotion that I have... perhaps I love too deeply, or with such fierce devotion and singularity that few are capable of returning it. I wish I could happen upon a soul more like myself, who could comprehend my feelings to their fullest, know my soul as well as my person... perhaps it is too much to ask..."

"event","Recently I saw a friend I had not done anything with in months (I love it when people randomly pop in at the door and I'm fresh out of the shower and naked), and it was refreshing to see how much she had changed, and then, how she was so very much the same. I realize that I have been watching so many alter and progress all this time; through the trials and horrors, the hysterical break-downs, wiping tears and whispering words of comfort and affection, then indulgence in the abundantly humorous and absurd in life, which we value between tragedies, lengthy, lip-service epiphanies late at night with unexpected individuals, or going down to the sea, on nights that are deep and still, whatever the season, and fighting the tides of time, eternity, and the want of self-absolution. And here I stand, mortal dust and a soul from worlds and worlds and worlds, made animate by hands unseen, feigning a destiny and a concern for purpose. I do not know what I think now. Perhaps I discourage thinking as much as I once did, or perhaps I tire of the paradox, which is really a perfectly understandable thing. I'm not sure whether I care what happens from this point on. It matters in a strange way, that seems insignificant when dissected. Chiefly, I am living my life, whatever the rhyme or reason, though I could live, perhaps, more emphatically, as I do under the stars when it suits me. 

With so many thoughts plaguing my head, it's a good thing I had the presence of mind to engineer an absolutely exhausting schedule for myself. The theory behind it all is that, when stressed to a certain limit, and overwhelmed with necessity, I will be burnt out enough to sleep and to achieve merciful apathy most serene. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I treat life lightly when I'm not introspective or philosophical, but in solitude it's difficult to be anything else."

"event","I absolutely hate being a romantic, or feeling the need to worry about my relationship, but alas, I'm condemned to fret over all manner of things, and to cry more easily and abundantly than I'd like to. I watched ""A Very Long Engagement"" last night, and it was a wonderful movie... a cleverly and beautifully woven love story... but it left me rather wistful. It rained all night; all I could do was sit and think, and I began to wish that my love could be slightly more serious sometimes, especially about his feelings. It makes me sad to think he does not love me the same as I do him; I'm not entirely sure that it's true, but sometimes it seems that way. Yes he's a man, he is not always attentive, he is always with me, he loves me, yes, but I wish he could ever say so seriously to me, or that he would more often anyway. Ah this is all a bunch of piss and moan but I don't know, I don't understand him sometimes. I guess I am simply more overwhelmed with emotion than he is for the most part, or perhaps I am more vocal about my feelings. I adore the boy, I'm going to miss him when I leave....

.... speaking of which, the move's in a month, and I'm registered for my classes.... it'll be interesting. I'm not sure what I'm going to do, or how it will be, sleeping in an unfamiliar bed in an unfamiliar city, with no one to to whisper to, and no one to hold or care for. I think it will be sad and very lonely.... what will I do without him?"

"event","My dad left a message on the answering machine in an accent akin to that of a chain-smoking, vespa-riding wop (... and if you're Italian, I hold nothing against you, and if you're an Italian from France the chain-smoking comment is most likely to apply to you), mixed in with a bit of Arabic, and Mario-esque vigor... yeah, Mario from the cartoon, not so much the movie. I'm still too terrified to call him back, and it's been a few days, so perhaps by the time I actually get around to it the LSD flashbacks will have subsided. I can hope, can't I? 

I'm a complete advocate of swimming nude, especially during full moons--sadly, I am a rather myopic advocate, and this sometimes results in interesting problems. Last night I stumbled upon a troupe of likely drunken fratties in a fruitless attempt to find my vehicle, treading about knee-deep in the surf, completely unclothed, with a completely unclothed female friend besides, being under the erroneous impression that their STATION WAGON was my truck. They started yelling and making quite a din so we headed back to deep water and swam several yards until finally my stupid Chevy came into view, and hot damn did we run for it. Oh well, it all adds to the excitement I suppose, though I really don't aim to attract attention to myself when swimming nude, unlike a great deal of women. 

It was a nice night, either which way, and I have nothing else to talk about. There was a gorgeous red moon Thursday, which I hope everyone had a chance to see. It was the most lovely thing, I was coming back across the ferry as it was rising, and rode down to the pier to watch it finish. I left when it had risen about a third of the way from horizon to zenith; it looked like the harvest moon, what a treat in June. Hah, I'm a babbling naturalist and one day it's going to get me put away... or land me the position of high priestess in a Dianist collective, but last I checked I wasn't a fan of even loosely affiliated dogma. Oh well. 

Hope everyone had a nice solstice; all of Scandinavia was probably drunk and jovial from the 22nd to the 24th, and I think we could use such a tradition around here (of course in this town getting smashed in itself is a sort of tradition, but I can't say I've ever been a part of any such rituals). Free alcohol is an excellent way to tempt folks into faith--consider if you will the holy communion (if you are Christian and take communion, I apologise, but I am a shameless witch)."

"event","Tomorrow is a little summer solstice picnic I am putting together with a few friends, half of whom have never observed the solstice, much less celebrated it in any fashion. The following brief speech and ritual is a nice little way to acclimate people to awareness of nature and the spirit--and for some reason, I just felt like sharing. So here we go.

(all sit in a circle; the one officiating speaks) ""The time of fertility is in decline, and we see the seeds which we have sown throughout the year enter a stage of fruition--of birth, growth, and metamorphosis. The pregnant earth's seed flowers forth, transforming, growing full-circle until the harvest---and we too may reap the fruits of our personal growth and renewal as the year reaches its close, provided we are willing to work with what we have begun, and to change and shape ourselves into that which we envision. The world is brimming now with new life--and so we are vibrating with full energy and potential. We need only take it upon ourselves to bring forth that which we desire within--though it may require sacrifice, a change in our perception of ourselves, or of life in itself, for as birth is both painful and joyous, we too must abandon comfort and security to make our wishes manifest."" (pour a glass of drink, saying:) ""Let this be a time of personal work and transformation--let us determine what we will tend in the following months."" (pass the cup deosil, saying:) ""What would you ask of yourself?"" (repeat this, each saying ""What would you ask of yourself?"" as the cup is passed, until all have drunk of it)

Don't ask. I thought it was nice."

"event","I've never really had a row with my boyfriend until today. Six months and one real argument (which was silly anyway, and probably never would have started in the first place if I hadn't been stressed out from paranoia and a bit catty besides) isn't so bad in my opinion, but we were both horribly upset. Incidentally, the whole ordeal was about him being critical of my driving, and me telling him to fuck off (and that the stupid Mexicans in the neighboring city are frequently the cause of my grief--FOR YOU DAFT CORPUS CHRISTI FUCKERS OUT THERE, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO YIELD TO TRAFFIC EXITING THE HIGHWAY, AND IN THIS COUNTRY WE BELIEVE IN AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE). He raised his voice a bit and I screamed and cursed and bit his head off, being an extremely defensive bitch, told him we'd talk about it when we got to the house, and I realized that he was getting teary by the time we had both parked ourselves on the couch. I guess I'm not very good at handling criticism since I tend to receive it in gross excess and for ridiculous reasons, and am accustomed to being belittled (ironically) in relationships by men who are in the habit of thinking that their penises qualify them for superiority over me, intellectually and otherwise... and any man who wishes to flaunt such an idea in my face is liable to get his balls busted, so it isn't recommended. So we talked it over, I felt guilty and cried a lot, and yay, we love each other again. What a fucked-up day I've had. I think I should quit eating tofu sausage... it does things to my temper. I'm also paranoid about some things that have been feeding on my mind for the past few days, and that really puts me in a persuasion, and all my alone time has been utterly shot. C'est la vie. Best well get over it all.

"event","I've been so angry and borderline emotional-overhaul lately, and it's becoming very aggravating. Whether it's the annoying scores of phone calls I receive over the course any given day, both my pets habitually conspiring to puke, defecate and ransack the garbage in the house on a daily basis in order to effect the loss of my sanity, my merciless disillusionment with the world and the improbability of my desires, or the simple fact that I view myself as pathetic, depressive and bored in my current frame of mind, I can't say. I am intuitively led to believe that it's a combination of these, but I could be possibly be wrong. 

Kristen spent the night since we found her door ajar (she said she shut it well on her way out, but I don't know, her family's out of town for a couple of days) and her cat outside, and weird lights on inside her house, and she figured it wouldn't be a great idea to mess around there. I woke up, and suckiness immediately commenced. I got up too groggy to be annoyed by yesterday's miniature atrocities, and good news: apparently the bastards with the UTSA housing department realized that I sent in my goddamn confirmation three weeks ago (they said they received it yesterday, but I know that's bullshit and they're incompetent fucktards anyway), so it looks like I do, in fact, have an apartment set up for me in San Antonio. Good news, cardboard boxes never were my style... and since I sent them my freakin' lease last week. Now for me, it just doesn't follow that someone would cancel their housing arrangement, would continue to receive housing arrangement forms and paraphernalia, and would consistently continue to return them, correctly filled in... but that just might prove to be *shudder* logical, and we can't have any of that, now can we? 

So okay. I had some good news today. Then I realized that the dog had gone through the trash, which included yesterday's rather fresh cat puke (the veteranarian is convinced that there's nothing wrong with her, but I guess shoving an intestinal lubricant down her very stubborn throat won't hurt any) and foil that had previously covered a very messy dish of lasagna. Go domesticated animals... Cleaned that up, ran trivial errands, sweated horribly since it's almost July and veritably sweltering... then went to see my boyfriend for the first time in two days. It seems like nothing but we're really quite attached, and two days is a while since we're typically conjoined in some fashion or another. So we drank tea, did all such whatnot--and for some bastard reason, I just sat at his feet on the couch and started to cry. 

I think I'm slowly but steadily losing my mind. I really don't care if I happen to be losing my mind since I'm not in the habit of using it regularly (don't argue the point, either), but it could at least be a little less embarrassing, and pester my eyes slightly less. So I got over it. When I cry, I berate myself for some reason, and say that I'm sorry and stupid and ridiculous, etc. Of course, Gus's brilliant excuse for me was ""you're just in love"". Terrible state of being, that. But it really is the cause of most of my upset. All that I love, in spirit, in philosophy, in knowledge and fascination... oh, many a love indeed, many a romance too... and all so improbable, and so difficult to imagine coming to fruition. I'd attribute it all to cynicism... I was rather shocked at some of the things I said to him. That dreams are just that: fantasy. Pointless to pursue. Liable to yield nothing. I was starting to sound like an adult, and I don't mean strikingly mature or lucid either. I was starting to sound a little hopeless, and rather lackluster. I suppose I'm just upset that UTSA is being so ridiculous. I could have gone to a much better school, but Austin's housing issue left me booted out. I wish I'd had the foresight to get on file for housing before I applied--I wouldn't be dealing with this bullshit then--but unfortunately I'm a procrastinating fuck (and I had no idea how bad it was there, but after seeing the campus housing I realized that it was all an utter mess--hah, there is great wisdom in hindsight, or so I've heard). This neurosis of mine, worrying habitually about not knowing what to do with my life--it's going to go away eventually. I hope it does in school. I just want to get away. San Antonio is really an awful city... and so inconvenient. My bank has a branch in every major city in my state for the most part, and in several tiny ones too--but not in San Antonio, oh no, so I have to transfer my funds. That and it's full of Mexicans and creeps (I'm not racist... but Hispanic men are disturbingly drawn to me, I get so many catcalls from them and they almost invariably rape me with their eyes until I want to scream), so I won't be surprised if I end up getting raped or something, frankly. I hate being female with a terrible passion... in some cities you feel reduced to fodder for sexual predators, and me in particular since I get more attention than I'd like to, not because I'm stunningly attractive or anything like that, but because I'm different. 

It's funny that I'm writing so much. I guess I really need a break. Midsummer's next week, and I don't know what I'm going to do. I thought about driving out an hour or so into Holiday Beach for the day, where there are actually trees and secluded places where you can picnic... maybe put some fish and strawberries in the cooler and have a little party like they do in Sweden, except with sparkling cider instead of alcohol, which all Scadinavians must be big on by default :)

 I keep thinking about snow and being in the mountains for some reason... I completely hate this place.

Socializing with people supposedly brings sanity to others, or maintains it through virtue of neglecting to focus on the negative. That's very amusing, if you asked me. I haven't had much time to myself and it's driving me up the wall. Some kind of karmic revenge against me for being too ironic, that. I love seeing people and doing things with them, but for some reason it's left me fried, insomnia-ridden, stressed out and depressive--and my attention span, for the record, is extemely limited right now. Being incapable of playing World of Warcraft for more than an hour or two is never a good thing. I also ate tofu sausage, so something is clearly wrong with me. I try to read, but it doesn't help. I think it's simply longing for better times... before life seemed liked a mail-order fantasy, and played out as static, sedate and one-dimensional as my former nine to five job. Ah, those times of antiquity. I've never wanted to run away and join the circus, particularly--but running away to some kind of SCA community wouldn't hurt? These present times are just killing me. I don't know how or why, but they clearly are. So. I'm a romantic. And I need some aspirin. 

I just want to beat myself senseless and revel in the lack of sensation for a while."

Valerie and I saw Madagascar... kid's flick really but it was hilarious in a sick and braincell-consuming way.

Chicks with guns, guys with guns, death, explosions, widespread destruction, and hitmen... mmm, only the 13th Warrior had it better figured out. Chicks with plaits, guys with swords, death, myth, widespread... death, again... and sexy Norsemen (no comparison necessary, I know--I felt like ranting). 

I know it's silly but I feel so useless when I'm not going to work. I may go work part time at the lab. Some of them are bastards but at least my boss gives me the love, and that's all that matters in the end since he's the one who allots my pay, crap though it is. =P

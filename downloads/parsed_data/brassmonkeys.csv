i wont call you baby like i did before
i wont call you baby anymore....

i just realised, ive never been dumped by anyone i actually liked. There was the derek incident but we werent going out, i guess me and james werent going out either. i always get too attached.
thank god for alex bragert. even though i talked about james litteraly all night, she made it more barable. i love that little nugget. 

i guess the only reason im not completly devistated is because its too hard for me to consieve that nothing lasts forever. i wouldnt even believe brooks was never coming back after he died. 
sometimes, when you ask for the truth and get it, dont you almost wish they had told you lies? 

i wanted to stay home and get smashed and wallow in my missery, because im the most pathetic shell of a person this world has ever seen, but insted me and alex watched legally blonde and threw chocolats at the tv and yelled ""LIAR"" everytime someone said i love you, and even when they didnt say anything.

i knew i shouldnt have been so emo, and told him anything, this is why i dont talk to people about things, because it pushes them away. so dont anyone tell me ""oh well you can talk to me ill always be there for you"" because i should have learned before. no one wants to hear that. 

i think he was just giving me false hope when he said we may get back together, ive said that so many times, and now i regret that i didnt mean it. 


uh, im sorry i wrote this, i am the most pathetic writhing little parasite i have ever seen. 

For a long time I was in love
Not only in love, I was obsessed
With a friendship that no one else could touch
It didn't work out, I'm covered in shells

And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life
And all I needed was a simple man
So I could be a wife

I'm so ashamed, I've been so mean
I don't know how it got to this point
I always was the one with all the love"

basicly what happend was did kiddnaped me from alex and i was set on figureing out how to get home. so i asked him to take me to the hospital because i figured they would say i could go home. well the stupid hospital people were like "" your unsafe, you have to stay here"" and i was like ""NOOOOOO AHDKHFAKHGAKTHGKDSA"" 
so ya, that happend, 
luckly we have friends in the medical field
mom called doctor shrand and they compramised to put me in the pembroke hospital day program instead of inpatiant at south shore. 
bleh, i never thought id go back there. im not even unsafe. maybe i have an issue here or there to deal with, but my coping skill is not dealing with things. however unhelpful it sounds thats how i get through life, i ignore things and think happy thoughts and it keeps me sane.



it is astoundingly beautiful outside today
i was laying in the grass under the sun, with the sounds of little joyful children across the street in cohasset. ah. 

i like the sun, and the grass, its all very lovely.


well anyways. im hoping to get out in a week at least. i start the day program tomorrow. i get out at around 3 every day and i get weekends off. so im not gone from the face of the planet like before.

obviously.

i hate having to go back and fourth between my parents, though they could never in a million years be back together, theres absolutly no hope of that, ever

i just want to have one place where i can be settled, i really hate stressing about packing and getting everything together and droping everything im doing to come over dads because he cant see me on weekends. and im ALWAYS late to school when i have to go from this house. i hate it, i feel like i want to throw up and cry and scream at the same time. I cried alittle in the car. i hate this

i hate the fighting, its been going on all my life, but i still hate it, because it never stops. 


im depressed, i might need more medicin. i cried alittle because my depression today reminded me of feelings i had, back in may. I wonder how im able to try to get over all that. i mean, ive been trying to just be all ""well thats the past and its gone now"" but its not gone, and never will be, its part of me. that massive period of depression is not just going to leave me like i pretend it has.  i mean, i was attempting suicide just last winter. and last spring. and not even the pussy suicide attempt were you take the pills out and look at them and put them back, but i would take the pills, over and over again. how can i just say, well im cured! some things just dont seem to leave me. 

i am so jumbled, i just want to rest and have my mind cleared. I need some drugs. 

im tired of this family, as of now, i will not be connected to these people other then that i have their blood, i want no further relationship with them. I want no family."

"event","how come everyone like has an eating disorder, its spreading like aids in a small african village. this epidemic needs to be stoped, people, eat, you dont know what you are getting yourselves into. you are entering a world full of obsession and addiction, yes it is an addiction, causing PERMANENT and potentially FATAL damage to your bodys. even if you eat plenty of one food group you could suffer from malnutrition, you all are digging yourselves a hole that its extremely difficult to climb out of, learn self acceptance before it is too late, and for gods sakes people, eat something if you dont want hospitals sticking needles and tubes in you all the time.you may not admit it, but i have seen the signs and speaking from experiance, i want you to know what you are getting yourselves into. 

back away and live simply

this gentle warning has been brought to you by linnea, take into deep consideration. thanks"

"event","well, it is my last night being thirteen, i dont know if i should be
happy or sad
i have accomplished so little and so much
taking a walk through memories now, realizing that i only have one
night left before ive moved on from that. 13 is suposed to be a mile
stone year sort of, and for me it really was. i survived it, sometimes
i never thought i would, sometimes i was eager for the future, alot of
the time i missed the past, alot of the time i thought this was the
end, tonight, i know that it wasnt. i have grown in many ways, my
search for self has just gotten more confuseing the more ive found out.
and so ends another year of the life of linnea. i dont know what to do
now. what do you do at a time like this? i wonder if i accomplished
everything i wanted to accomplish at 13, i have 12 hours to finish if i
didnt.
i remember when i was little on my birthday and count down the years
till i was 13, ever day going out the door and yelling to no one, ""4
more years till im a teenager!"" like it was the greatest thing, i can
remember the night i woke up and was 13, i rolled over and wisperd to
myself, ""well, im a teenager"" i never really thought it was as great as
i imagined, but its been interesting. maybe ill stay up all night to
soak in every moment i have left, or maybe that would be childish, i
dont know. i think when i was little i had a list of things i wanted to
do when i was 13, wear a bra, go galivanting off with a hot guy, spray
paint public property, dance on a table top( not in a strip club or
anything), sing for a crowd, love myself, fall in love. i did some of
those things, but i still have like 11 hours and 57 minutes to go
galivanting off with a hot guy. i actually danced on a table today at
the skate park... yeah. ive made alot of mistakes this year, not little
mistakes, big ones, but somehow, its ok. everything is kind of, just,
ok right now, maybe things are gonna be alright. thats what i want for
my birthday, everything to be alright. theres little chance of that.
lets see, today i drove a few yards, very badly, passed for an 11 year
old for a discount, swam in the lagoon in my bra and underwear(ohh i
hope no one saw...) cried, laughed, danced, ate some food, used the
power of prayer to move traffic, and got honked at by guys too old for
me. what more could you want? i dont know what to do with my life now,
hopefully something worth while.
another thing i want for my birthday is to be able to eat birthday cake
and enjoy it guilt free, just for one day. :(<br>

"event","i just returned from mv with alex. it was radical. we went to katama farms and stole a chicken, for no reason. i named it Ernesta. it was just kinda running around out side the pen and i captured it, but obviously it wanted to be free so we didnt really steal it, we LIBERATED it. he he
and then we brought it home and kept it in alexs laundry room,we  were able to keep it from her mom for like a day befor alex told her. but she said that we ""found"" it in the middle of the road. im suprised no one thought it was suspicious that two girls were walking away from a farm grasping a chicken, oh well. at least we didnt get caught. but then later Ernesta got out of the crappy pen we made for her in the back yard. so we looked for her, and then went back to the farm to look for another chicken that looked exactly the same, and we found one, i had to go into the pen and get attacked by chickens to get it, and i had to chase it around in circles. i was pecked much, and it was painful. then on the way home from mv alexs mom made us take the replacement Ernesta back to the farm. and then we saw the real Ernesta running through the yard. lol

we hung out with alexs friend caroline, she is super rad. we went kayaking and tiped over one of the kayaks and it almost sunk. and then we were under the dock and her mom had brownies and stuff and she threw them down to us. my brownie got slightly soggy. and then caroline missed a lemon square and it sunk to the briney deep, her dads friend ted was like "" i cant believe she droped it"" in that snappy british accent thing he had going on, it sounded really funny. then carolines mom got mad at her for burping, she was like ""you just let them rip anytime you please! how can i take you to restrants!"" it was funny. we hung out with alexs vinyard friend nick too, and watched aqua teen hunger force and went down town and watched them throw nicks sack around, alex almost got it stuck in a tree. unfortunatly, nick got it.

then me and alex went on a shop lifting spree and took junk that we have absolutly no use for. oh well. 
we got lammas and hung them out the window of the car on the ride home. it was fun, le vinyard is radical, i miss Ernesta. oh well. maybe some how, some day, we will meet again. or maybe not... or maybe."

"event","pretty interesting day
i went to the saint paddys day parade with vicky and nick, it was fun, they threw candy and stuff at us
and i risked my life multiple times to run out into the parade to get candy and a hat someone droped, i also found some sunglasses. 
vicky was wicked scared of the clowns though, she freaked out. then a drunk driver hit tk o'mallyes and 2 people got seriously injured and one might be dead, one was a four year old. im mad cuz i didnt get to see it. darn.
wow im so heartless. people died and im just like darn i missed it. wow people are retarded, the mothers against drunk driving people were there too, i wonder how they felt. 
when that guy sobers up hes gonna feel horrible. oh well, maybe next saint paddys day i wont miss when someone dies. wow im an asshole, why would i want to see someone die? my mind works in mysterious ways 
well on a brighter note, its equinox!!!! horray, i cannot wait to fix up the pirate ship and get her sailing again! its gonna be sweet. anyone who wants to come along with the crew is welcome to help pillage and plunder and strike fear into the hearts of everone on the north river! i cannot wait. right now i think would be a good time to run around and skip and frolic about. and if you need me, thats where i shall be."

"event","today was weird,happy,sad,beautiful,strange,undiscribable all in one incredible moment it seemed
i left alexs and was going to get my pass port and just mood shifted to pissy and bitchy and unable to tolerate the smallest annoyance. so we were in the post office which was packed and they asked for my hight and i didnt know so dad said 5'4 and i didnt know i had gotten taller so he said "" i know you've been trying to stunt your growth but its not working"". how inconsiderate, he does that without knowing, says things like that all the time, it hurts. i wanted to cry, he said it out loud with all those people there. then we were in the car and mom and dad started fighting about, erm, who knows what and i was just sitting, not careing, not interfering, then dad tried to get out of the car on 3A without it being stoped. mom didnt let him get out though till we were off 3A but he did get out and walk in the snow. then i was all angery and upset so mom droped me home and went to go get dad for he was being rediculas, bad move mom. cuz i was out of my mind so i just droped my crap inside and kinda compulsivly ran into the woods and just kept walking till i couldnt see the road anymore, and then things got weird. 
~ Linnea Goes on Parade~ (rip off from the beatles a hard days night 'ringo goes on parade')
 i was just sorta running around not knowing where i was with no clue where i was going till i found the trial for the brook, and followed that for a while, then i crossed the brook, and followed the some other hikers footsteps that were left in the snow from a few weeks ago, and i just    kept   walking,it didnt even feel like it was really happening, i didnt feel anything really, i wasnt even cold. it felt like i was watching myself walking from someplace else, but not controlling it. i must have walked a few miles, i ended up at 3A and still not wanting to stop, ran across into a field. i ran in the field and stumbled and skiped and laughed at nothing and then walked through it and only stoped walking when i got to the north river. where i stoped and contemplated jumping in, (ya i was really out of my mind). but i just stood there for probably 30 minutes just thinking and remembering things and watching the water. then i decided it was time to turn around, i had reached the limit of my mental cage. i just kind realised i could keep on walking but i really wasnt going to get anywhere. so i walked back up the field and was spinning around and lied down and just talked to they sky asking stupid questions like "" whats out there anyways? why am i here?"" i wonder what was wrong with me.  and i was marching saying im on parade, like ringo. (you wouldnt get it unless you saw the movie) and i was carefree, and sorta calm and happy, it was nice. so i went to where i met pat and bryce and tim and i hadnt been there since camp. i just walked around, remembering, i even found pats ""spear"" that he sharpend to kill squirls with. good times. and then i went in the little shelter thing and just danced like i had at camp when jill played the bag pipes. and i had imaginary conversations with camp friends. then i left and walked home following my earlier path. i came home dripping wet, mom didnt say much, but i felt really alot better. 
then i danced to REM whats the fequency kenith and ya. 
it was pretty cool. 
and that was my day
i know, im out of my mind"

"event","i went to orentation thing at the high school, and was completely lost and dazed and confused the whole time. i didnt know where i was for about 98% of that tour. nor was i listening cuz add meds wore off and i had no possible way of paying attention. i signed up for Diversity club! woooot. my mom was like why did you sign up for gay club? (omg what a homophobe i cant believe she said that) and then she wanted to cross my name off and i was like now way im going to gay club. of course, alot of the stuff i signed up for i didnt know what it was about (like diversity club) i just was having fun writing my name on stuff. yah. i also signed up for key club (well actualy megs mom signed me up for that, i dont know at all what it is.) and drama club, and girls lacross, and wrestling club! i only signed up for wrestling club because i was given 20 bucks if i did it, i was all scared though cuz they were like 12th graders that were all like ""AHHH WERE THE WRESTLING TEAM AND IM GONNA RIP YOUR FACE OFF"" and i lied about my weight cuz i thought theyd be all like youll get killed get out of here. i dont think im gonna do wrestling, cuz i probably will get killed, and be the only girl surrounded by horny teenaged boys. wait, actually maybe ill stick with it.......
but then ill get squashed so oh well. and its not like im gonna meet horny boys in girls lacross, or diversity club. well maybe diversity club but they wont be hot for me. ok i got off subject, what was i talking about again? oh yah, high school.....is gonna be crappy, they should have named it martha high school. oh well    ill go anyways. i want to try to take all the required classes right away so in 12th ill only be required to take like 3 classes. but i wont cuz im not capable of working that hard. 


today i went to the center with meg and jimmy and nick and ashlee and brittany and it was chaotic. we almost got kicked out of the library and when the lady came over jimmy was holding a book about rape and on the computer we had typed ""penis for dummies"". then we were just standing in the little thingy on the dairy queen and being idiots, and calling people pretending we were having a hot orgy. makeing moaning sounds in the backround and shit. then we went to hang out in marshells and jimmy found a striper magizine that had all these striper advertisments and we called one and jimmy said ""my striper died, can i have my money back?"" and then we were throwing thongs at eachother in marshells and the people were staring and there were just thongs flying everywhere. then we went to the super market and nick kept taking pics of everyone that walked by. i dont know why we were hanging in a super market. i guess we're just lame like that, but nick gave me a dollar which i then put in my bra, still there actually, i just remembered that. and ya so that was my day, thanks for taking the time to read, even though i doubt anyone did cuz i doubt anyone cares becuase if i were them i wouldnt. and if you did take the time to read, you need to go get a life right now."

down coastguard, i made sure to hit as many kids on the way down as possible. 
we used orange trusty, and crazy, (the sleds) 
crazy is named crazy because hes crazy, no lies
the most unpredictable sled in the shed, you never know if hes gonna swerve to the right or left or flip over or stop or spazz out and buck you off. but thats half the fun. 
alex is coming up the stairs, shes in the room, shes RIGHT BEHIND ME! AND SHES WEARING MY SHIRT! (lol almost wrote my shit,) he he he he he *giggles* 
now we're gonna be good marthas and eat our fresh baked cookies, from the garden. 
i just found out recently sean was gay, which is weird cuz i dated him for a breif period of time, i should have been able to tell from the high voice, great hair, and pink font. but im just oblivious i guess. now i want to set him up with someone so if you have any gay friends tell me! 
but now i feel like grace from will and grace. FUN
alex are using internet lingo to comunicate,

at gym when me and hayley tried to negociate leaving the gym room to piss and take care of feminin issues but he wouldnt let us becuase hes a women hater 

and when hayley said that they probably pay slaves in africa to do stuff (cough racist) 
lol alex isnt it nice that both the cheddar and pamisian cheese goldfish can live peacefully together in the same box regardless of cheese type.

Of course it's your decision,
But just so you know,
If you decide to leave,
Soon I will follow

i love my friends (dispite what i wrote in my french essay, i ran out of things to hate in french) it happens 
but i really dont know were i would be without them, they bring out the best in me
yes i know it sounds incredibly cheesy but i think theres some people out there that need to know that they are cared about. j'adore mes copains, cest super. ya i probably said that wrong o well

scary skool faculty member comes over to our lunch table after i had drawn a bunch of arrows that said pablo pointing at pablo from all directions. i didnt know what he was saying but i got scared (like i usualy do when forced to confront a stranger i dont trust) so i hid under the lunch table. mr. mic cormic comes over, glances under the table breifly looking confused and just kinda walks away. meanwhile katie and sam are holding back hysterical laughter. then the scary teacher person comes over and trys to push in my chair, squishing me in the process as i try get out of the way by going further under the table. then i give in and come out. the teacher meanwhile starring at me as me and sam and katie burst into hysterical laughter and i try to explain to him that i was hiding. in the middle of my explination he just kinda walks away...
quite possibly this was the highlight of my week 
another thing to add to the wall of superly stupid moments 

ya so the band got together it was coooool. they got mad cuz i tried to sneak hayley and meg on me bus and apparently my bus doesnt like outsiders on it. they thought they were unworthy or somthing
so we rebelled and had me mom drive us to me house. 
most of the time me and hayley were haveing major adhd moments so we were too busy being retards to get anything done. but we did think of some better names 
lol airplanes, the space men, interstate 95, the duds...lmao

then we went next door and got sodas from the coke machien while all the mecanic people stared at us wondering what the hell we were doing 


ya so the end

its the end of the world as we know it, and i feel fine. 
i practiced drumming and i think i have gotten alil better since i had to learn the drums about 2 weeks ago for this silly band idea john had. i honestly dont think its gonna work out but u never know! but i think it would work out if we fired john and got someone with actual talent or that could actualy play somthing unlike the rest of us. well we can play alittle. but i think the name definately has to change, hearts of fire? people are gonna think we're gay. you know like flammers? the title mabye could be better tought out.

ya so that night my mom said to me ""dont do anything that would make me have to take u to the doctor"" im not sure if she ment about the recent increase in si (code name) or maybe it was somthing about the samhain ritual i was gonna do (even though theres nothing wrong with it, its just she probably doesnt want me to burn down the house with candals) but i felt alil offended. she doesnt really trust me anymore
i feel like ive ruind her life by not being the daugter she always wanted  i have failed her 
o well 
ive been wondering alot lately about if i suddenly died in some unexpected freak accident if people would be able to say nice things about me like they did for brooks. or if they did say anything nice would it be even a third as nice as what they said about him? i dont feel like ive accomplished as much as he did. maybe someday i will accomplish somthing good but i have to tell myself that hes gone and not comeing back
i still havent begun to believe that 
maybe i never will 
srry how is it i can take an entry that starts out so innocently and nice and turn it completely sad and depressing and pittiful 
i played tarrot cards and got the card with the hart being stabed by 3 swords, i was afraid of that 
it means i take to much self pitty (which is true if u read my jounal) but it also said i could be a good actress someday maybe (horray i have a goal) maybe i wont fail in life and everything will be alright just like i always wished it would be."

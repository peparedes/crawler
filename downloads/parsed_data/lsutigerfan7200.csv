"event","Today my mom woke me up at 7:30 because we have painters coming to my house to obviously paint. i had to get up so that i would be dressed before they got to my house. i was really tired. when the painters got to my house i had to stay and help them when they needed help. that sucked. after they left (3:00) i had to read a book for an hour nd write about it. when i was done i thought i was going to be able to go out and skate but then i had to practice my trumpet for 30 minutes. after that i had to finish a scout merit badge i didn't feel like so i went to sleep. when i woke up i decided to finish it. i finally finished it and went out to skate board. since i lost my computer privileges i couldn't get on the computer so i went to bed at 9:30."

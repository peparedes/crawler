"event","Work is Horrible.

Today I had to work 4-11, People kept comming in and i Hate people. but other then that is was the usual

I got new shoes too and i really enjoy them.
And I got my t-shirts from threadless.com in the mail and im in love with them.
Im kinda excited for school to be starting again because then I can see people and stuff. Plus my classes are pretty fun.
yesterday I got to go to playdome ever since I first started going Janine has gone with me, it was like a ritual, 
well this time she gets sick the morning of so she couldnt go. Instead I got my little brothers friend Sam to go on all the rides with me because my brother is scared of them. It turned out to be not so bad but I would have had more fun if Jan had come. I really miss her.

Thaaats all"

Everything, just for a cheap thrill. <br />My father is a drug addict, he has been one since before I was born and he continues to be one until he dies. <br />He has never been part of my life, he will never be part of my life, he may know me, but he doesn't know who I am on the inside and Thats what hurts. <br />How can someone have a child and not love them when they are part of you? <br />And how can you say you love someone when you choose drugs over them? <br />Even though I feel so much anger towards him I know he did something right, because of him I appreciate my mother so much more, she is such a big part in my life and I would never disrespect her. He also helped keep me away from drugs because I know how badly they can ruin your life and how much I could never be like him. <br />Some believe that when you are a teenager you should live a little and have some fun by drinking and smoking pot on occasion. Well both of these things can lead to other drugs that are harmful and can kill you. <br />There is a such thing called ""clean fun"" and you don't need to be drunk or high to have fun. <br />Some peoples lives are screwed up and I understand that, but isnt there a better outlet to deal with your pain rather then drinking/ doing drugs I've heard it helps to escape reality but is it really worth your life? It can make your life worse by doing them when you are living on the streets prostituting yourself so you can get your next score. <br /><em>Its just not worth that.</em></font></font>"

we went to yoga and it was hella hard and i fell down several times. At the end you get do do this rest thing and your suppost to relax on your matt but i ended up falling asleep that was bad.
I have so much homework i am suppost to do today too but I can't because i dont know how so i have to do it in socials tomorrow. My teacher is so stupid, i dont understand how she expects us to have a whole project done by thursday when she gives it too us on monday? especially when im always busy and she gives us barely any class time. her whole work ethic sucks.

Anyways
tomorrow i have to work and i hate working its the worst thing in the world but i guess making money is nice

It was pretty dull and I didn't end up doing any homework because im a slacker. Anyways today was better it was school and school pretty much sucks but its alright with friends I hate my first 2 classes because they are super boring and I don't really have anyone in them. But I usually like my last 2 classes because i've got andy and clayton in them. accept that clayton wasnt there today so that bothered me. Needless to say it wasnt all that great but people said they liked my hair, which was pretty sweet.

Right now it is 4:25 and andy is over right now and he is doing homework. I hate homework so i decided i would touch this junk up.
Also degrassi is on tonight! Also homework sucks azzz

"event","So, I've viewed live journal for a heck of a long time but I never actually used it for my own journal. Mostly because I have no life so I would have nothing to write about, and also because I don't know anyone on live journal so whats the point? I guess it doesn't matter though because people don't have to read your journal to write in it.

So how was my day?
It was pretty alright I got my hair all chopped off and well it looked like poo at first but when i straighted it and added product and now I am kind of in love with it. I mean its different, but im pretty different too so i guess it suits me? Yes it does.
I also when to a movie, eight below It was reallly good. I thought it would be pretty stupid but I really enjoyed it. I don't think i have ever cried that much watching a movie. haha but yeah it was a good one. 

I thought I had to work tonight too. I hate working but they called me yesterday to see if i could work durring the day today and I thought that i worked tonight so I couldn't but they said that I actually was suppost to work last night not tonight so i had to work then and my clothes werent even washed yet. I hate work.

I find that this weekend really isn't very fun, Andy is in idaho or something and I pretty much only talk to him now adays which is petty sad but I can't help it, I hate everyone else and its not like they do anything to make me hate them, I just do. Im more of the type of girl to have one goood friend and then a few others that im not tight with, but they are always there? I dunno 
alls I know is that Andys not here so its been a boring weekend. 

Tonight was also the acoustic show and I kinda wanted to go, i figured it would be pretty good but I can't go to them by my self because im a sucker and I feel if I do i would be left out to sit on the side alone and im not good with that, instead I just decided to sit and home and make a live journal. 

Maybe tomorrow will be a better day, minus the homework of course because I have a whole lot."

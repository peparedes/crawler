Rocky tonight!! YAY!

I have a good friend, Kris, coming to see it for the first time, so I'm excited and nervous. She's hyped up for it too, but she's going to be sitting all by herself... :( Too bad Katie isn't coming.

On that note, things are going good between us... haven't had much free time, but at least I have my priorities!

VIDEO GAMES! mortal kombat style.

Work's good. I'm good. My mom's good...

Brian and Kim are engaged! YAY!!!

Im all cleaned up and looking good.

Meh, time for another hit.

*snorts*

Catch ya on da flip side!

Shepards we shall be for thee my lord for thee.
Power hath descended forth from thy hands,
Our feet may swiftly carry out thy command.
So we shall flow a river forth to thee,
And teeming with souls will it ever be."

"event","Getting into the Katieness... and the swing of having a girlfriend again. Jeez, its been too long. My last girlfriend was back in April, and we broke up after about a week. Fuck her. 

I don't know. It was a bit wierd at the beginning, I didn't know what to think. I'm glad she likes me though.

""What's the cheat man, what's the cheat?""

So apparently I've been telling certain people certain things. Fuck that. Im getting tired of people and their drama. I cannot wait to leave. (With the exception of the Katieness). I need a long break from people here in general (AND STUPID FUCKING HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA!!!) God I can't wait for some people to get through their years of school, then they will realize that LIFE IS FUCKED UP and there is NOTHING YOU CAN FUCKING DO ABOUT IT! SO DAMN!!! People get riled over things they have no control over. Life is just a series of incidences to keep you from getting bored with everything. 

So no more raving for a bit. No more ex for a LOOOOOOONG time. Done with the BS of drugs for a bit.

Meh. (Stole that word from Jeanette.)

Resident Evil: Apocolypse
Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith

Well, my happy go lucky readers. Things will be coming up soon, tight financial situations, and such. Let's see if life can get with the program.

With the sincerest of regards~

This is my first entry, like that of an ancient novel retold through several centuries. 

Where will the pages take me?

No idea. 

But consider this the introduction, and the chapters yet to unfold.

To be continued...

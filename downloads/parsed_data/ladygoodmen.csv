I was so happy to see here. it just sucked becasue we were both tired. we ended up going to see a movie in waukesha we saw  the excorsim of emily rose .. it was creepy but very good :) i was bummed that we didnt get to spend more time together but hopefully we'll get to hang out again soon !

"event","friday night kim came over and picked me up we ended up going back to her place .. her dd was having a bon fire so we sat their for a little while trying to gind something to do luke came over and chilled with us. at like 10:30 she got a call from her ex boyfriends loser brother, he was stuck on the east side his bike broke or something and was leaking oil. so luke kimmy and I went on an adventure. on the way down luke tanked some beers. we got thier and this kid was going to take us to some party on warren st. but the only problem was none of us knew where the eff warren st was ?! .. so I mad the mistake of asking someone ""do you know where warren is?"" .. and I got the simple minded answer of ""warren who"" .. my bad I forgot to say warren st ! 
so we just ended up taking this kid home and the 3 of us went back to kims to enjoy the bon fire. then korin comes over like 30min later and brings a bunch of carrol boys .. so we all get tanked. and luke and I end up pushing eachother on the tree swing .. then laying in the hammock together. weird !?

finally its like 10 to 3am .. so luke goes home and kim and I go to mickey d's but for some crazy reason its closed. so we think maybe tbell is open to 3am .. well it was . so we ordered pull up to pay .. and the chick  starts screaming .. and going crazy .. were like wtf !? .. she runs away and this other guy comes and i guess  we ran over a sauce packet and it shot her in the eye! what are the effin odds of that happening ?!! crazy shit. so we get to my house and I ended up never falling asleep , kim was on the phone till like 5am amy called me atr 4:30 .. I had to get up at 8 and babysit! 

yesterday we just chilled went shopping .. post-it noted lukes car while he was at work .. then hung out at his apartment. today im going to a family bon fire thing in wind lake and tomorrow is the demoderby with elliot .. im so excited I cant wait !

I relize I dont deserve anything good any more . I know I screwed up and I cant fix things. everyday I still think about how things used to be . hangning out with my best friend, no cares in the world. and I threw it all away for no reason . I have nothing to show for it. I really want to get my shit together, get my car fixed, a job . new friends . and just start over. I feel I am a different person now (again) and im not going to make the same mistakes I did last time. im learning I just hope I can succeed"

"event","so here is my update 
came to waukesha yesterday for the baby shower, the baby was born 5 weeks early and 
is now 15 days old he is so very cute. so I ended up having some old friends from target come 
over kimmy, bob , ryan , and lando .. then we stoped over at emilys d. and hung out with her and chap 
for a while it was nice to finally hang out with different people. 

bennett and I broke up, which I think is good .. but its crazy david wants me so bad 
and I dont know what to do ? other wise everything is looking up .. I just need to find a job .. 
I have been clean from blow for 3 weeks .. iv been getting counsling im a little happier other then 
that not much going on .. im staying with my mom. I help at bennetts house just about every day with 
cleaning stalls and letting the horses out and then chill at home with my lil sister."

"event","bored .. start my new job tomorrow i'll be working monday thru friday 3pm to 11:30pm .. sat and sunday off which is nice 

waiting to go back out to waukesha, I got a call from frank today and amy is in the hospital I guess something to do with she has high blood pressure so she has to have the baby 4 weeks early so im going up thier to be with them and make sure everthing is okay 

partying has been fun but im honestly getting sick of it, and all the money it cost. with moving and this new job I want to try to get back on my feet. 

im happy with bennett but its so hard with him still having feelings for his ex and working with her and talking to her it sucks . it makes him act like an asshole and me be a bitch. its so hard iv become so attached and how could I not he was the niciest to me. he called me everyday , the sex was awesome, he would go to work and get off at 4am and come home and crawl in bed with me I donno everything was perfect and now it seems to be going down hill and im scared"

amy fianlly broke up with kyle im so happy for her she is going on a ""date"" today with this joe guy that she has liked since 4th grade he seems really cool and that he will treat her like the world. 

I met another guy online he lives in minnesota, iv been talking to him for like almost a month online and like everday this week on the phone. he makes me happy and thats all I want is to be happy and smile. he seems like a dream. I dont want to rush things becasue I want this one to work. everytime I talk about him or i am talking to him I get butterflys and I have this feeling like things would work out really good between us. i hope im right. im making sure before hand that my heart dosent get broken again and that he dosent turn out to be another jesse. im finally realizing where I went wrong with him so im being extra carefull that hes not the same way. 

i want to move out I think its time, im going to start saving my money and looking for another job. i love target but its not cutting it anymore. i love my new car its so me. 

iv been hanging out with my cousin alot lately, its fun I know he cares about me witch makes me happy becasue I havent had that feeling from someone in a long time. but I know he'll be there for me whenever I need him. 

sorry if I havent really been talking to anyone lately iv been trying to keep it low key. and it seem like everyone is doing the same. I relize now we are all going our seprate ways. i still care about everyone of you, and I hope you know any time you ever need anything all you have to do is call . even if its just to talk. 

well im out .. sorry this is soo long but its been a while since Iv had a meaningful update

<b>[recap of January]</b><small>in no specific order</small>

I have worked over 300 hours this month alone.
my car broke so I spent $100 and got it fixed and then it broke again 3 days later so now I have to buy a new one. 
I got a raise.
i've lost 20lbs .. most of it was probally due to the fact that I was sick for 3+ weeks.

not sure what else I cant really think right now. iv worked the past 7 days in a row I had to wake up this morning at 4:30am to be to work by 6am ..it was fun im glad I went I always have fun at work . i guess im weird.. I dont have off till friday and I think I close everyday this week so i probally will only be leaving my house to go to and from work. 

frank found a car for me I guess a 94' honda accord (white).. I dont know if I want it yet .. but he said if I dont he's still going to buy it for himself and sell the sunbird ?! so I donno ?!"

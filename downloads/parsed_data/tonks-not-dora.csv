"event","*waves to new friends* Hi guys :)

I haven't posted in a bit, because I've been sick (tonsillitis, although most of you know that already) and I've had midterms to make up... not to mention ten thousand other things that are going on. But I should have some new stuff to post later this week.  

I was wondering what people are interested in seeing more of from the lovely miss Tonks. I want to go back to the joining the Order stuff soon, but I have a few little!Tonks ficlets in my head, and some schoolage!Tonks stuff too... sometime around her sixth year. I can't do an awesome poll like <lj user=""enders_girl""> did for <lj user=""teh_weasle"">, so I'll do a fake one. 

<center><b>For my next post, would you rather see:</b>

A. Three year old Tonks being fluffily adorable at Christmastime (ficlet), or
B. Sixteen year old Tonks being a rebel with pink hair at Hogwarts (journal entries)?</center>

You decide! Leave me comments :D

<b>Edit:</b> I will be doing both of them eventually! I just wanted to know which one you wanted to see FIRST. XD

<center>Suffice it to say she was pretty excited to pass.
Not that she ever doubted it... although she'd 
much rather prefer to forget about that S&T exam.

An <i>Acceptable</i> was... generous. Knocking 
over one's exam proctor while they are in the
process of administering a practical exam is 
generally frowned upon."

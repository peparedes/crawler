"event","<STRONG><FONT color=#cc33cc>Ok i know no one looks at this but if anyone comes across this entry and reads it please help. My bf of almost 3 years wants to kill himself, we broke up. He doesn't understand that he needs to move on and i have told him i'm not everything. But he doesn't understand and i have really lost my patience with him. Everything i say, he comes back with a smartass remark and we just fight and he always threatens to kill himself. Afraid that he will i am thinking about telling someone, i think i will tomorrow but how the hell am i going to get him to stop liking me so much? If i'm mean to him then he's just gonna feel more depressed but i wanna get him to see that he can live without me. Then again if i am nice to him he just tries to make moves on me and makes me feel really uncomfortable, so what do i just leave him alone or try to be there? He just annoys me now, he always talks about how he feels sorry for himself and he doesn't know if he can live without me, it's all very pathetic. If you knew him and heard some of things he said you would think the same thing. So i'm caught in a sandhole that i can't escape, i'm damned if i do and i'm damned if i don't.</FONT></STRONG>"

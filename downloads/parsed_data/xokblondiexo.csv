I'm actually doing very well. Life is pretty good :)

Work is absolutely fabulous. I am beyond obsessed with my job. I'm currently trying to decide if I am loving my job because of the people I work with and/or I truly love what I do. I think it's honestly lild 30/70 in favor of the girls I work with. Wednesday I had an interview with Katrina, our District Manager, who is sort of / completely a huge biatch & super BHam. So I didn't even know she was coming, I thoutght it was an interview with Meggy *my manager* who I am 110% completely fine with. But I was just myself and I am literally the opposite of Katrina and Meg said she was really impressed with me. Amazing because she hpnestly hates everything we do.So quick to go negative on us even though we are the best store in the division? So I might be assistant manager at our store, possibly Briarwood in AA or Somerset because they are honestly absolutely retarded.I want to stay at 803 obvi. I am obsesed with the girls, espec. Meggy and Jen. Jen is the love of my life. She 25 and went to Ladywood... I'm honestly totally in love with her, such a fabulous girl and kind of like Rocco - whatever she does I cannot get mad at her, because it's her. I don't know, I just love her.

So I think I want to work for BCBG corporate. I love the corporation. We're based in LA but they have a small corporate division in NY. I've been talking to Ryan and I feel like / I know, he wants me to come out back east. I won't plan my life around a boy in anyway, but if it works, it works. He's sweet for hanging on. Such a completely solidly good person. Few and far between these days.

Jason and I broke up. He was super not good for me the last few months. 
Really condicending. Anything I did was not pefect obviously, but there was always a huge issue with it. He wanted me to be super into the fact he was going to be a doctor. True life - I wasnt. Do what you love, he didn't love it, it was about money. So not attractive at all. He's brilliant but so not compassionate so I feel like he prob won't be a great doctor. 
people cant feel if you genuinely care about them or not, he prob should be in research. Not like I know.

That's about it, I sort of love my life right now. Totally not where I thought I would be but life works it self out I guess.

love to all

"event","okay so this is going to be yet another dumb entry that nobody will understand. since everyone has been so emo lately i can get something out to everyone, you may all think im all "" HAPPY "" all the time, but im not. i haven't been. i've probably talked about it to a couple people but not many.i can't count the days that i've gone to school and put a smile on my face and pretend to be happy then call it a day. ive cried my self to sleep for what seems like ALL OF MY LIFE, and its not right.i've found out that me crying all of the time about really stupid shit makes me look like an idiot but its just tears that were held up in me that i have yet to let out. but lately they have been coming out more than ever. so its sunday night and i have school tomorrow, i've got so many things on my mind and if you asked me what they were, i couldn't tell you. i want to trust every person i meet,but i can't anymore. its not like back in elementary or middle school when you didn't even THINK about trusting people, well i didnt. now i just dont want to trust anyone anymore for numerous reasons, im always the one to get fucked over in the end ;all of the time. there are very few people that i can trust and im pretty sure they know who they are.
i can't sleep and im really upset so i can do is sit on my bed and listen to the fray and cry until my mom comes in because she hears me. and now im updating and telling you all how i feel because i have nothing else to do. goodnight."

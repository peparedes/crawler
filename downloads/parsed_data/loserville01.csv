So this morning i was wearing this BIG PUFFY LIGHT BLUE COAT, right? So, i went to my bus stop at 6:40, 5 minutes before my bus actually comes.So yeah i watched my bus go down the street turn around in the culdasac(sp?) come up and SPEED past my bus stop. I was like ""WHAT THE FOO?"""" (Jennifer that is SO my phrase! :)) And i started jumping up and down,while my bus was passing me. He didnt see me.So, i ran as fast as i could up the hill to the next bus stop. I have NEVER ran that fast before in my life, not even in basketball games. So yeah i was like ""ZIA TELL HIM TO WAIT!!!"" like 5 times before the girl at that bus stop got on, but she didnt hear me...I was like ""FOO!"" So i ran back down the hill i just ran up, cut through 4 backyards to two streets over to catch the bus over there. Im like have really bad sinuses right now so by the time i got over there, my chest hurt really bad, and i couldnt really breathe. Bad part was that the stop i got on, there was a REALLY HOT GUY that gets on there. And i was really embarressed. OMG to the E*POINT! So my bus gets to that stop and i got on and my bus driver looked at me kinda funky and i was like, ""You know you sped right by me at my stop right?"" And he was like "" I slowed down and looked for you and didnt see you."" WHATEVER! He didnt even slow down, AT ALL! So this afternoon right before i got off the bus i said ""Thanks for remembering my stop."" And i walked right off the bus...hehe

So had a LATE basketball game tonight against some ex-varsity Parkview basketball players....wow, it was close....NOT! 45-19. hehe...I scored 10 of those 19 points...yeah buddy...

Festival band rehearsal tomorrow...

My grandma's cousin is getting married tomorrow AT my grandma's house...how retarded is that?( I have my reasons)

MATT RUCKER IS GAY! hehehe 

Valentines Day is tomorrow, and for the 16th year in a row, i dont have a ""valentine"". hehehe....This day sucks....

Hope yalls is good though!

I miss Matt..."

Today my church were handing out Valentine Day balloons where you had to buy one before today for a special someone. And pretty much everyone in my Sunday School class got at least one...except for me.Even my brothers got one.So yeah, im unloved...hahaha..and im sure Tuesday at school is going to be similiar to today. 

Friday night i babysat some kids with Leslie Fowler at my church.We both got $30 bucks...sweet...Afterwards we went to CVS and saw Jennifer Waller...I drove myself too...which was fun. 

Saturday I went to go see ""Bye Bye Birdie"" at Berkmar High. My friend Elena was in it so i went to support her. Saw some kids from Parkview which was cool. The ""Conrad Birdie"" in it has an AMAZING voice. He sounded just like Elvis, it was so creepy and cool.When he first started singing, i didnt believe it was his real voice. And he was ""kinda"" cute.His character was like a Elvis wannabe type too, and he was GREAT at it.

Anyways im going to go back to reading my book. Mr. Darcy is just falling in love with Miss Elizabeth Bennet in ""Pride and Prejudice"".But i cant seem to get into the book...I like the movie..."

"event","So, yeah, been really busy with school. Stressed out about different things. Today i stayed after school to get help with Unit 9 in Music theory and mr. magner was like "" if you need anymore help just come to my office."" And when i needed help he had disappeared. So i waited till jazz band was over and asked mr. beach. Mr. Beach and Mr. Magner think im obsessed about music theory because i HAVE to get a 100 on it and everytime i miss one, i start over. I ended up getting a 98, because after awhile i just said SCREW IT!I missed one. I still have another section to do, before next week. So much for my 100 in that class. You dont know how many times i restarted that unit....it was getting me MAD!

So right now i have a 101.88 in SS. I ended up getting a 102 on the last test.I thought i screwed up/ i knew i screwed up on the essay...but he didnt count it. Oh well.

Well, time for a couple of hours of sleep before i have to get up and do stuff...as of right now...im completely stressed out and tired. Hopefully my stressoutness will be over after i get my liscense next wednesday."

"event","Dude..this weekend was definetly not what i expected and definetly what i needed in my life right now. 

Friday- We arrive at lake junalska and we get room assignments. I ended up rooming with Amanda Fergusen and Hannah Davis. 

Saturday- Woke up early and went to breakfast with the skiers, ( i was not one of them) and came back to the lodge and got ready for the day. The people who did not go sking went shopping in downtown Waynesville. Came back and had a little nap. Skiers came back around 5 and we all went to dinner and then had devotion. After devotion we came back to the lodge and my roommates straightened my hair and put make up on me... Hannah dragged me to the boys room against my will....hehehe...(Who is going to straighten my hair on retreats from now on...?) and then I fell and hurt my elbow real bad.

Sunday- Slept in, and went to morning devotion. Came back and got ready to see a movie. Saw ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"" with some people. I was torn between movies or playing football with everybody else. Im glad i chose movie because everyone got bruised up. Kevin wanted me to play football and Tori wanted me to see a movie. oh well...Came back and freshened up and then went to dinner and then night time devotion. I got really close to some of the people. Went back to the lodge and ended up getting sick. Everyone went to Waffle House/Huddle House while i stayed back and slept.I fell asleep watching ""Pretty Woman"".

Monday- Woke up, washed my hair and then packed. Put stuff out in trailer and hung out till we were ready to go. Left about 10. Slept all the way home

Fun Times....

My Devotion Group: Me, Robert, Kevin, Melissa, Justin, Derek, Evan, Mr. B., Mr. Yates, Josh.

Awesome Group..."

Im happy to say that i scored 4 points...go me....and i got ALOT of rebounds....dude...I flipped a girl over my shoulder...it was SWEET...well not for her. I had the ball and she was all over my back and i went down to guard it from her and the next thing i knew she had gone over me and landed on the floor. This girl was as big as me too...it was awesome. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A TEAM FALL AS MUCH AS THEM!!! i swear..everytime i turned around...one of their players were on the ground. Especially that girl i flipped...She fell constantly. My coach said she is nice and all but can be VERY dramatic. Our 4'2 90 something pound girl ""bumped"" into her and she went down. She faked alot of falls. The refs were also calling no fouls. But hey...we played a tough game...and it was one of the funnest i have ever played. Both teams were VERY AGGRESSIVE...My brother said he has never seen ANY girl team as violent as the teams that played tonight. Hey,a girls got to do what a girls got to do.

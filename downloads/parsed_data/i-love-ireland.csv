"event","Hello. I was feeling artsy so I took pictures in my backyard and decided to share them with you. I started scrapbooking my Michael Buble pictures from the concert in Des Moines which was almost a month ago...hard to believe. I feel like I just slept in Kelsey's car last night haha not a month ago! I will post my scrapbook pages when I am completely done.  Anyways I hope you enjoy my pictures ;)

"event","Okay so this weekend totally kicked mucho ass. Saturday night I sang ""Inside Your Heaven"" by Carrie Underwood at a friend's wedding, and I'd have to say that it was probably one of my best performances. In which I am so glad cuz it was someone elses day that I didn't want to end up ruining with a bad performance. So there were some pretty hott guys there too. Anyhoo on to Sunday. I woke up at about 6:30 to get ready to go to Des Moines with Kels for our concert. So we leave and the trip seemed pretty short even though it was about 6 1/2 hours or so. But that's why it's cool riding with friends so it won't seem so long. So we arrive in Des Moines around 2pm and go to check into our hotel she reserved online. The guy checked her ID and tells us sorry but no one under 21 is allowed a room. So we were the WHAT THE FUCK?! SHIT! So we had no place to stay in Des Moines after the concert. So we go to find a place to shop, but in like 3 hours of looking all we find are fucking dollar stores and auto repair places. What the hell is that about? So then we decide it's about time to find where we are going to park for the performance and we find this parking garage place, but no one is there and it seemed closed but the gates were open and some cars were parked in there so that's where we went. Hoping to God that we would be able to get out of that garage with no trouble we went up and walked on the skywalk thing which was kinda fun to find the civic arena and use the bathroom. Then it is about time to go to the concert 6pm and the concert started at 8 so we would have time to get to our seats yadda yadda. We got dressed in a bathroom we found in the skywalk, like one of the only things open up there jeez. And we head to the civic arena and find that we were basically 2 of the 1st people there, which was awesome. We got to buy our Michael Buble merchandise way ahead of everyone else, the first ones to be precise. Fricken awesome too. So then we just sat and waited for the doors to open and the arena had like fricken gorgeous red walls. Very classy looking for a classy act. Then we got into the arena and our seats kicked ass. We were sitting 2 seats away from the aisle so we could get out easily, which comes into play later in the story. A comedian did his act before Michael and it was amazing. He made this joke about how he told his longtime friend, who was curious of where ducks go in the winter, that they hibernate under the ice in lakes and such. So his friend believed him haha...it gets better later in the concert. So Michael started with his song ""Feeling Good"", flipping hott. Oh man...a man in a suit is haaaawt! Then after he was telling the audience how he had learned something tragic before his concert and it made the night bittersweet. He started slowing his speech and becoming emotional.....then he told us that his best friend...........is a big dick! Haha cuz he heard his friend saying how gullible Michael was for believing ducks hibernate under the lake from earlier in the comedic act haha fricken hilarious. Kels and I both thought someone died and it was sad. So the concert rolled on sexily...and I mean sexily whoo baby. Took some photos and videos of it. He sang Kels' fave song ""Moondance"" and mine ""You Don't Know Me"". He let an 11 year old girl sing a part of ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" because he felt bad for swearing at some parts of the concert, which I thought it was awesome that he swore :) *GLEE* Then Michael did some of ""Ring of Fire"" by Johnny Cash...hot hot hot....then he broke right into ""Billy Jean"" by Michael Jackson, dance moves and all! AAAAAHHH! Soo famazing! He even grabbed his crotched and thrusted like Jackson. HAHA SO GOOD! Hot hot hot! Then during the beginning of ""Save the Last Dance for Me"" Michael mentioned for anyone who wanted to to come up the the stage. So Kels and I started getting up and my nose ring fell out. Dammit! Totally at a bad time! So I shove it in and we hurry up right next to the stage and got some amazing pictures and video. He made definite eye contact with Kelsey and I. He was in the center of the stage when he saw us and decided to move the mic and himself over towards us! AAAH! Amazing! I noticed that he glanced at this really tall girl in front of me, but then looked down at me a lil bit longer...I felt special. Like his looks he gives are ones that may seem misleading for an ""I want you"" look haha. Well maybe that's how I wish to take the look haha. Then he went around and touched the people's hands lined up at the stage! HE TOUCHED OURS!  EEEK! OH THE JOY OF HOTTNESS TOUCHING ME! HAHA! And he touched his crotch with that hand earlier *wink wink* haha. Sadly the show seemed to end too soon. It should have lasted forever. So we went back through the skywalk and sang at the top of our lungs MB songs and danced around...it was fun. So we found the car and no one was there still so we were like ""Thank God!"" We ate at Perkins with our creepily nice waiter guy. So we drove back to this town called Mindon or something where we ate at an A&W for lunch that day so we could sleep in Kelsey's car for the night. A true ""Blue Highways""...OB would be proud! Then 10-15 minutes later cops came haha yes cops! Kelsey was awake but I was out, but then woke up realizing Kelsey was talking to someone haha. So we kinda told him we were getting tired on the road and needed a break and not that the hotel we booked were being fuckheads haha. Soo he was cool about it and I went back to sleep but Kels had trouble. Then we woke up and left by 5:30ish am. Went to Vermillion to the Ntnl. Music Museum...cool stuff. Sioux Falls we shopped and then came home. HOME! YAY! ""Maybe surrounded by A million people I Still feel all alone I just wanna go home Oh I miss you, you know"" Well I hope you find Kelsey and mine adventures as amazing as we did, but I doubt it cuz it kicked way too much ass! If only Michael knew how much shit we went through for him. He's definitely worth it!

Pictures! The not so blurry ones were the up close and how I wish more personal ;) ones :) *Glee*

"event","Yeah bitches! So my brother bought me my tattoo today for my b-day a few weeks ago. Man I was soo scared that it would hurt like hell, but in the end it wasn't bad at all. Most of the time was fine, it was just when he went over spots he already did so they were tender. Oh well I made it through and I'm very happy with the results. It's right below my neck. Here are some pix of it. I didn't find any designs I liked so I designed it myself. Tell me what you think por favor :)

Well a lot has passed since then, I've finally graduated high school, had a birthday, got my nose pierced, and I am planning on getting my first tattoo this Friday. Oh the excitement! Sadly I haven't been watching TDS/TCR episodes right when they are fresh and hot, I've been watching the reruns of the night before. I stay out way too late haha. I've been wishing Stephen would go back to using ""Truth Phrases"" at the beginning of his show, I've always loved those. ""I am the Walrus goo-goo-guh-truth!"" Love it!

Laura shrugged her shoulders and replied, ""I could throw ten $100 bills out of the window and make ten people very happy.""

Cheney added, ""That being the case, I could throw one hundred $10 bills out of the window and make a hundred people very happy.""

Hearing their exchange, the pilot rolled his eyes and said to his co-pilot, ""Such big-shots back there. Hell, I could throw all of them out of the window and make 56 million people very happy."

Ooh and the Frankenstein skit went marvelously! I will try to get pix up as soon as I can! ""Formidable Opponent"" between Agatha and Felix cracked a few laughs, but then again I was dressed as 1/2 man 1/2 woman. Lipstick on one side of my face and a stache on the other. ""Hottie with a naughty 1/2 man 1/2 woman body"" is all I can say!

I just thought I would share an idea that popped into my head. At least my friends thought it was chuckle worthy at school, but I was there in person to actually narrate the story behind it. Oh well, I said no offense so none should have been taken. Next subject. Spring break starts this Thursday. I have musical practice which shall be interesting. The director made me furious today. She kept telling me to smile and stuff, but the people around me weren't and they never got yelled at. So I was kinda mad. Ooh our Frankenstein skit for english is tomorrow and I'm totally pumped. I get to be two people and do a whole ""Formidable Opponent"" scene with myself, and I get to bitch-slap myself. Then Ray Charles breaks us up then we hug. Woot Woot! Everyone reading this is probably going ""What the hell?!""  I failed once again to entertain you! Oh well life rolls on!"

No, this didn't really happen, but wouldn't it have been exciting if it did!? So I had play practice today. First we sang through our songs, then at 6:15-8pm we learned the dance to our song ""Hooverville"". We're doing Annie if I haven't specified yet. It was amazing! I haven't danced forever since I quit dance team and it was mighty exhilerating! I love the song cuz it's so angry. And by the way if you live here I DEMAND YOU GO TO THE MUSICAL or I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN and BEAT YOU LIKE A RUBBER CHICKEN! Soo yeah....twas rather exciting. I have a test over The Tempest and I'm bound to fail it. I had no clue of what we were reading cuz it was boring as hell and I was staring off into space most of the time when we read. eek! Oh well english sux the big one anyways. I can't wait until May, cuz all we do is read. Kels and I are planning on reading, Assassination Vacation, by Sarah Vowell. I am PSYCHED!"

So that is numero uno on my list of ""why today sucks the big one"". haha kinda sounds like a game show...anyhoo so numero dos is photography class just cuz it sux in general, no real reason why it sucked today but it always sucks. Numero tres (i love my engangol...not spanglish bitches) is calc class today. We are learning some more cracked up shit that makes no sense whatsoever and we get this big assignment whoo hoo FUCK is what I'd like to say! Numero cuatro umm english wasn't so in class today it was the out of class business. We have our 5-7 page research paper due tomorrow with a title page, abstract, source page, and a figure. Ugh! It has been causing me stress since she's assigned it! That and we need to memorize a poem to recite in fron of the class...ugh WHY?! I hope tomorrow is 100% better than today. Any way what spanish number am I on? O yes numero cinco we had our 1st musical practice after school. That is another influence to my sudden panic attacks I have at home. I just think about when I have other things going on at the same time as practice and if I will be able to memorize my lines and stuff like that it just freaks me out! Numero seis: jazz choir. I had that right after play practice so yeah and our director has been getting on my nerves, well I guess he has always been on my nerves! Numero siete: contest coming up in about a month and not knowing my solo or duet (another reason for panic attacks). Numero ocho: (espn 8 the ocho haha) I didn't get home tonight until about 8pm so I was away from home for about 12 hours! WTF and teachers expect us to have extracurricular activities and do hours of homework? What is up their asses to make them think that that is possible? I'm sure Superman would even have trouble keeping up without thoughts of dying! So this has relieved some of my stress, by typing on here. I am just exhausted. Oh plus I have to make out a form for NHS which is due Thursday. Oh shit! How do people expect seniors in high school to get any scholarships made out and do the 5 billion other things also. Hey I may be a woman and can almost do anything, but what is to be expected of our senior men? haha! Sorry I had to throw in a sexist joke! People, especially teachers, need to not expect sooo damn much out of us! AMEN!"

Oh Oh Oh Oh the one and only PLAY-DOH....so this week went incredibly slow for me...maybe it was because of all the Colbert Report reruns or maybe it was because God hates me! I'm trying to weigh out the odds here! Anyhoo my family and I went to Aberdeen today for me to audition for a music scholarship. I think I did okay and the judges seemed impressed. They want me to major in music, so I am seriously thinking about it, it's just that I don't remember how to play the piano. BIG DOWN SIDE! Damn my not so mad skills on the piano! But there was this judge that I thought was cute. He had this Rob Corddry hairdo going on and was very nice, but it turns out he is already dating an aquaintance of mine. Sooo yeah. What they say is true: They're either taken or gay and yes I have had my gay ones here and there...so maybe it is that God hates me in a loving, but oh so mean spirited way!

If you have to take a test today, be extra careful and write everything out in pencil. Mercury and Neptune could make it hard to recall details you thought you knew by heart. If you can, limit your mental performances to creative stuff like writing and art. 


Pretending that something isn't the way it is will only make you happy for a while. Eventually, reality will poke its head through your pretend veneer. Be prepared for anything and see life as it really is. It'll only hurt at first.

"event","Hello,
I was just curious if any of you have seen the movie Brokeback Mountain. I know it's kinda random, but they seem to mention it at least once each episode of TCR. So I was just wondering if it is any good cuz I wanna see it, but I live in a republican state so we prolly won't be getting it any time soon! Thanks a bunch!"

"event","Hello.
I guess I am kinda new at Livejournal. Kelsey told me I should get one so here I am! Umm...I seemed to have missed a great Colbert Report cuz of my dong barking and idk if this is where I am suppose to ask people if they have the clip. All I know is that it was January 12, 2006 episode and I think it had the ""bears"" as not #1 on the list...see I'm not very good at describing because I haven't watched the show for a long time and idk what things are called. Then he received a letter about kids saying he doesn't love bears so he had a segment about kids, something else that was really funny, and bears...I have such a bad memory I'm sorry. So if you know someone who has this clip could they send it to me or w/e you do for Livejournal. Thanks a bunch!"

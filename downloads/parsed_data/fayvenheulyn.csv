"event","Okay. So. <br /><br />Last night, I produced a pretty huge post with two dozen illustrations, all neatly tucked behind a cut. But it seems livejournal doesn't particularly favor wide pictures, so at least a third of them were horrendously cut off. I just deleted the entry, no use keeping it like that. I&nbsp;did try today to make thumbnails for each image, though, and to struggle with the table and link system the livejournal editor provides. Hopefully this will work out.<br /><br />I&nbsp;haven't drawn or written anything in years due to my previously mentioned bout of depression. I've started to again, though, and it's been therapeutic. Please don't judge these images harshly, none of them are meant to be professional... they're not meant to be <em>anything.</em> They were images from characters or scenes in stories and projects of mine that I doodled out simply for the joy of creating and to try and get down the images in my head onto something solid. <br /><br />Anyway, I hope that you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed bringing them to life.<br /><br /><strong>Edit: Cool!&nbsp;It worked.

"event","Hey bitches, I am totally back.

And my, my, my, has it been a long time.

I needed a (rather incredibly long) hiatus from writing my own personal feelings. A few years back, around when the last entry of this was posted, all I could bring myself to pen were horrible thoughts and feelings. Writing out my sadness didn't really make me feel any better about it, rather, it truly brought me down even further. I&nbsp;needed to get away from that for a while.

In case anyone around is still wondering about me, I&nbsp;did fall into a depression for a few years. It got pretty bad.&nbsp;I won't really venture into the gritty details here, but it wasn't pleasant for me and it wasn't pleasant for the people around me. Recently it became so bad that I started hurting myself and&nbsp;I&nbsp;entertained some very dark thoughts regarding removing myself from this world. 

Fortuantely, I never entertained them deeply enough to do anything stupid. After several very difficult events, I&nbsp;managed to find my way slowly back into the arms of my old friend happiness. For the first time in too many years, I felt inspired to be me again, inspired to create, inspired to love and enjoy my life. I&nbsp;hadn't drawn or written anything in what seemed silent centuries, and I simply had no will to approach doing so. But that is very different now, and I feel I'm well enough to return to writing in my old little space on the interwebs again. It's kind of nice really.

Anyway, if you're still out there, and reading this, hello to you. I&nbsp;haven't forgotten you, I&nbsp;just needed to go hide from the world for a while and recover from my own angry inner critic. I must admit that the person writing this entry is quite a bit of a different one than the girl who penned the last one. Time is a curious thing. It alters, soothes, molds one into something else. We are not stagnant creatures. I'm not an entirely different person, though. I'm still trying to write that old story I kept mentioning in here about the elves and crap, though thankfully it's not quite so juvenile anymore. I still hope to get it published. 

Anyhow, I must admit to aching a bit; today was a very long day. I'll post more later of course. Writing this, I realized how much I&nbsp;missed livejournal. I hope you are all doing marvelously, whatever path your life has taken you on."

<br>Though I am not all too active on the internet anymore, I still play NWN a bit. (I asked for Guild Wars for Christmas, maybe I will get it.) My character I have been using consistently on roleplay servers is Yve Idorian, an Avariel (winged) elf.

She is holding a really weird looking spear there. I love her robes; I put a lot of time into crafting them. They're an important plot item from her past. They are enchanted. :D Yay.

On a Tuesday afternoon, a man died.
They carried his corpse inside and there it lay for
Days.
It did not rot.

I sat in the room where he
Lingered.
Deafening silence--sometimes he opened his eyes
And peered at me with milky pale blue:
Speaking, or trying to speak.

I cried.

He would not decay and they would not take him
Anywhere else. His haunting existence filled my
Brain with terror and I wept for everything I was
And all that he was not.
Still, the quiet lingered.

Flowers grew from the floor on which he lay.
Black, wilted, twisting things of rue and enigma.
I could not bring myself to tear at them, to pull the
Roots from his skin.

No one knew why I was crying."

"event","<p>Today has been so excellent to me. I'm in a great mood. 
<p>I actually got 8 hours of sleep for the first time in two weeks, and I even had a really cool nightmare. XD; Most nightmares aren't cool but this one was more like some kind of night terror and I woke up having severe neck spasms that I didn't quite know I could have. :D 
<p>I brought Pink Floyd's ""A Momentary Lapse of Reason"" CD and Ike played it in the car very loudly. It was a great way to start a morning. When we arrived at school, I purchased a breakfast of potato cakes, french toast, and vitamin D enriched milk. I am so posh. It was totally delicious though.
<p>Whoo. To top it all, I don't have work today. Really, that makes all the difference in the world. I went to bed and woke up feeling so much better than I have been. I feel I have an eternity to do things (after I get home from school today.) I have nine hours to spend doing whatever I choose. It's so wonderful.
<p>Speaking of which, my parents talked to me about quitting my job. I want to. I've been wanting to. It's not that I don't like Udder's (even now I feel a pang of guilt at the thought of leaving, as the place has been good to me for nearly a year) but I'm not quite faring well with the full-time-school schedule thing + six hour a day work. :D Really, I think I'm not being fair to Udder's by staying. I'm not the worker I used to be.
<p>I have always prided myself in doing a nice job and I have gone out of my way before to ensure things are done and are satisfactorily clean. But as of late, I find myself so tired and exhausted by the time I even arrive to work that I have not been even completing expected/basic tasks to satisfaction. It's really not fair of me at all, but I've been so tired. 
<p>Seriously, though, the thought of having time to focus on school/other projects during the day is so awesome to me that I am in a great mood now. I think really all I need to do is cancel my cell phone (which costs $200 to do, ick--yes, I screwed myself with that one :P) and I will be set.
<p>Hooray. :(

I guess I just have to personalize things. :P
<p>That took only a moment because I found I'd had all the layout settings saved. Seriously, fools, check it out sometime. Crazy kids.
<p>Also I will for real get on AIM. I think I have Thursday off. Anyhoo, I have to get going because Ike is coming to pick me up (I carpool) early this morning for school, and I'm already falling asleep at the keyboard and talking gibberish. So. <b>[Edit: SO HOW ABOUT THOSE $3.50 GAS PRICES, HUH, GUYS? HOW ABOUT IT?]</b>

I really am in love with the short story it is based from and I think I will read it again if I get a chance. Mmm. So sad and lovely and beautiful. I love stuff like that. 
<p>I think in the future I will buy nine posters of the movie and put them all over my walls (probably overlapping) and I will buy the movie three times (twice on DVD and once on video) and... if they have t-shirts and action figures then by god I will buy them too. /end fangirl love"

"event","<p>Hey Warcraft nerds,
<p>I got really bored and so I just spent like three hours making the closest thing I could get to resemble a <b>night elf</b> in Neverwinter Nights. It was really hard because none of the armor looked anything like Night Elf attire, and the closest skin/hair tones I could get to accuracy are a pasty blue-grey skin and nearly midnight blue hair-tone. :P Hooray. But anyway. I am totally a dork.
<p><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v401/elingil/smull.jpg"">
<p><lj-cut text=""Here are some larger pictures with description"">
<br><br>I did all of this with the Community Expansion Pack (CEP) which is a downloadable extra feature of the game that allows one to add more features/further customize character appearance.
<p><br><br><br><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v401/elingil/lelf1.jpg""> 
<br>Basic picture/pose. I tried to get a good shot of the full body to show all the armor. I even looked a bit at a Blizzard reference for armor design, and made sure to keep small details in like the fact that she has no shoes, etc. I realize the tattoos on her chest are kind of exaggerated/weird (as well as a bit dark) but they were the only ones I could really get and if I would have made the tattoos any fainter, the color of her lips would have went faint and looked non-existant too. For some reason the program registers lip color and tattoo color as the same thing. It is also unfortunate that I could not get white eyes or any kind of facial markings. 
<br><br><br><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v401/elingil/lelf2.jpg"">
<br>I went so far as to make a longbow to accompany the outfit for, well, authenticity I guess. It wouldn't be right to see her running around with a scythe or something. :P Once again, I customized the bow and tried to give it a natural, woodsy kind of look. Or something. Yeah. Also, I christened the bow ""LOLBow.""
<br><br><br><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v401/elingil/lelf3.jpg"">
<br>In the realization that there are just as many Night Elf druids as there are rangers/archers, I made ""Ye Sticke"" (another attempt at a natural/woodsy effect) which I tried to make resemble a druid's staff. Er, as for the odd pose, she had just fallen down and was standing back up when I took the screen shot. Hooray. 
<p>So yes, there is my dorky and retarded adventure but for some reason I feel both amused and accomplished. Hooray for elves.

"event","<p>Ok, I am really really sorry that I keep going on about ebay, but this just really pisses me off. Hell, this isn't just about ebay, it is about art in general.
<p>I have been browsing original painting sales on said website and I am getting really pissed off that these fucktards have no idea in hell how to price art.
<p>Most of these paintings are absolutely gorgeous, and the artist obviously spent a lot of time on them, and if not time, then at least put a lot of creativity and a part of themselves into the paintings. However, I am seeing them selling these on the 'net for like $15.00 for an original, detailed oil painting.
<p><font size=""+2"">NO?!</font>
<p>I wish that people would sit back and realize what they create is, in many ways, priceless, and should be at least worth more than a dozen dollars. : \ I'd say at the very least to charge $40 or $50 (at the LEAST) for a simple painting and $15.00 for a drawing or sketch. 
<p>Maybe I am just too expensive, I dunno. But it makes me really shocked and sad to see a lot of art go for obscene prices.
<p>Artists: Do you have any opinions on this? Am I being too pricey, or do you feel art is often undervalued, etc? I'd really love to know what other artists felt about this.
<br><br><br>Edit: I am actually thinking that even $50.00 is way too little for some of these paintings. Urgh."

<p>I just hope it will sell well. That would be sweet if it did, though, because some Stereotypical Fairy watercolor paintings were getting like anywhere from $20 - $200. Hooray!"

Not nearly as much as I post in the art-specific journal, but highlights or special things, yeah.
<p>I'm sorry, but art is just a part of me and will always have a place in my thoughts, and this journal is a collection of said thoughts.

<p>This is actually a <i>really</i> strange product of mere boredom; I wanted to see what one of my characters would look like as a female (<s>uh oh, TG</s>) so here (s)he is. XD Yay.
<br><br><br>Lots of stuff has been going on lately. Agh, I can't even remember a good portion of it from the top of my head, but yeah. ...I know I have some serious medical problems, though. Even my dad told me I need to see the doctor soon and my parents are strictly anti-doctor whenever possible. I've been getting the nastiest migraines I've ever had, ones that carry me to levels of pain that I didn't know existed. The other night I was screaming from the pain and though I was restricted to thriving in a pitch-dark room, the whole area emitted some blinding white light. <i>This is the brightest black I've ever seen</i>, I thought.
<p>Also, I have been thirsty as hell (like, to obnoxious extremes, having to walk across the grocery store a total of six times (and this is holding myself back) during a 1.5 hour period to get some water from the fountain. All I can think about is getting something to drink. I don't care what it is. My mouth and throat are constantly dry and thirst has overtaken my thoughts to obsessive levels, much like someone who hasn't eaten in days begins to think or dream of food. 
<p>Ah, and lots of pissing, too (as a consequence.) :P I think I'm diabetic, actually. It does run in my family. Urgh. The migraines are the worst though. Well. That and the thirst. I'm almost intollerably thirsty right now. I just drank a shake, a glass of water, and two diet mountain dews. :(
<p>Uh. Also I am going to Florida at the end of the summer which is really fucking awesome. I've never gone anywhere on a vacation. I have to work really hard to save up. Probably need to ask for more hours, etc. I am going with Ike to visit Heather who has moved back home (FL) temporarily for the summer. We are all coming back to IL together to resume fall classes at ICC. Yay.
<p>Happy times. ALSO I GOT A GAMEBOY SP. It is sleek. I feel like a pimping bastard now. Oh yes, oh yes. You want to touch my SP.

"event","Hahaha, sorry for the more or less double-post but I want to describe the doll since I don't have a camera.
<p>Taking the paint off the face is the hardest part. It clumps and smears and stains the actual vinyl head. The process of entirely removing facial paint takes about an hour.
<p>Then, I carefully painted all of the facial features with a tiny, tiny brush. I used simple 98 cent craft paints. I gave her a completely new look (defined by a new set of eyes and a wicked red smile) and I painstakingly painted her fingernails black. It was very tricky because my hands were shaky.
<p>Then I tied up her hair so that it is in an unusual and unique style, I tied it with a black ribbon I bought. I also had purchased a ""Barbie fashion"" shirt that was a purple medieval type top and I tied black ribbon around her sleeves and waist. I took an old skirt that is too small for me and cut out a lot of the (black) material from it and formed a skirt for her, one that is far too long for her so it is flowy and also it gives the illusion that she has creepily long legs. Finally, upon the doll stand, I put her in a pose that seemed to fit her expression best. I love it. 
<p>The whole process took about four and a half hours. :3 Well worth it, though. I just wish I had a camera. ._. Maybe I can post a sketch. ...That wouldn't quite be the same though."

<p>I wish so bad that I had a camera right now. I have an awesome new hobby.
<p>Inspired by some webpages I found last night, I have begun to remake dolls. As in... taking a Barbie doll, scrubbing its face down with nail polish remover, repainting all the features in my own style, creating my own clothing for the doll, and restyling the hair.
<p>Seriously, it is awesome. The finished product looks NOTHING like the original doll. They aren't pretty litlte big-eyed cartoony Barbies anymore. I am so fucking proud of myself, seriously, the second one I ever made is excellent and is this awesome cool gothic-type creepy lady with a strange smile on her face and medievalish clothes. It's SO COOL. Seriously, I love this. So much fun.
<p>If or when I get an available camera I will take a picture of it and also show what the original doll looked like. The doll I bought (originally some kind of ""Fashion Fever"" barbie) came with its own doll stand so that is awesome x one billion.
<p>Sorry, I'm really excited and pleased. :3
<p>A lot of stuff has happened in the past few days, too, so I will write about that eventually also."

"event","<p>I spent tonight sitting in my rocking chair and listening to Elliott Smith sing ""Blackbird"" (Beatles' cover) and I had my giant overshirt draped around my shoulders, wrapped around me. His voice and song were like a lullabye, and I nearly fell asleep. The night is very slow.
<br><br><br>I work tomorrow night. I thought I worked Saturday instead but I suppose I confused the days. Whoops."

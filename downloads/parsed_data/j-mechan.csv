"event","Okay so i really dont know what to do anymore.  I really truly do like Wayne alot but im totally pissed that he slept with Amber.  I have nothing against her its just him that im irked at.  I dont know what to do anymore, i know for a fact thought that i dont want to be played by him because that's what Kristen told me.  She said that he is playing both me and Amber, its like he's using us and i dont really appreciate that.  I'm so tired of men, and how annoying they are at times.  I dont know what to do anymore, he called me at about 9 o'clock this morning, i was sleeping so i didnt talk to him, but i havent called him back yet either, i dont know if i want to call him back or let him try and call me again, which i highly doubt that he will do since he rarely ever calls back like he says that he will.  I'm just going to let him decide what he wants to do and who he wants to be with.  I'm thinking that he slept with Amber because he didnt think that i would give him any, but u know what the more and  more that i think about it the more i think that if he asked i would have said yes to him.  I really do like him and i would so totally do him, so i guess well just have to wait and see what he decides to do. *sighs and frowns*

"event","Okay so the guy i was talking about in my last entry, how i liked him and wanted to be with him and all that crap, well i take every word that i said back.  I am very very very ticked off right now and have been for about the last 4 hours.  I was out riding around with my friend Kristen and I was blabbing to her about Wayne and stuff cuz, at that time, i liked him alot and was still thinking about him.  Then she about killed be because she told me that last night he slept with this girl named Amber, who i might add he barely knows.  I was pissed, really really bad cuz of things that he had said to me and then he turns around and pulls this crap on me.  He told me one day about how he liked me sooooo........ *gasps for air* ooooooo...... freakin much and wants to be with me and everything but doesnt want to start anything quite yet because it is too soon for him to get attatched since he just broke up with his girlfriend.  Well if he didnt want to get attatched then WHY IN THE HELL DID HE SLEEP WITH AMBER????????? because Kristen also told me that Amber wants to go out with him and that they are possibly thinking about hooking up.  I was just like what the f*ck wait one minute he just told me not ever 3 weeks ago that he didnt want to have a girlfriend cuz he just broke up with Robin but when he was ready he would definatly want to go out with me.  So the rest of the night i was wanting to punch something, screaming, and plotting my revenge *evil grin*.  I told my friend that when i go to college i want to find some guy that is really really freakin hott and i mean HOTT!!! end up going out with him cuz he likes me alot and thinks im beautiful and everything and then at some point in time i'll bring him back to T-ville and bring him with me everywhere i go and then accidently bump into Wayne and make him jealous as hell cuz he'll want to kick his own ass before i get anywhere near him cuz he will have missed out on many things since he decided to screw Amber instead of possibly thinking that i myself might want to do him, but u know what thats not gonna happen cuz i'll already have done it with someone who wants to be with me and knew that i wanted to be with them, and so on and so forth.  So from now on I think im gonna steer clear of Wayne and not worry about him.  But other than that 3 WEEKS TIL I MOVE IN TO MY DORM ROOM AT EIU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *bounces all over the place with excitment*

"event","Okay so there is this guy that i know his name is Josh Roz, he is one of my ex boyfriends and he lifes like 3 houses down from me.  Well there is a guy named Wayne that moved in w/ him like forever ago from texas, and the 1st night he moved here was the 1st night i met him and i instantly knew that i liked him and I had this feeling that he liked me too. Well ever since then we had always been hanging out with eachother and literally hanging all over eachother, but then he got back w/ a girlfriend of his with whom he had a baby with.  Something funny about this though is even though he had a girlfriend he still hung on my, giving me long hugs, and everything.  Well like 2 or 3 months ago something really bad happened.  I was at my friend, Kellie and Jerica's, house, which is next door to the house that wayne lives in.  Well i was gonna take my friend Kathy to the gas station to get some suckers and as we were leaving wayne started to walk by my car.  So i made him stop and talk to us and he was talking about how he and his gf were fighting so i made him get in my car and go with us and hang with us for a little bit.  Well while we were at the gas station we all got out but only Kathy went in and wayne and i stayed out and the whole time we were doing nothing but hugging eachother and talking about how i was gonna be leaving in august to go to college, he wasn't to happy that i was leaving but he understood that it was for a good reason.  Well we got back to Kellie and Jerica's house and Robin, Wayne's gf was outside flipping out about him leaving with me, so i grabbed his arm, and i mean his arm and pulled him into kellie and jerica's house and Robin saw this and freaked cuz she thought i was holding his hand.  He then went back outside where they continued to fight and i felt really really bad about it cuz i felt like it was my fault, then i found out that he had called the cops on himself and Robin so i was freaking even more.  Well then i went home and was still worried so i called my friend Kristen to talk to her and it turns out she was down the street hanging out with Kellie and Jerica.  So i asked her if the cops had been by and she said no and then asked y and i told her.  Well then i heard Wayne so i wanted to talk to him and i did.  I told him that i was so scared cuz i heard that he called the cops on himself and i felt so bad cuz i felt that it was someway my fault.  Well he laughed at first and then told me that he didnt really call the cops on himself and then told me that i had nothing to worry about cuz it was in now way my fault.  Then the next  day he called me and asked me if i wanted to go swimming with him and then he said that Robin packed up all of her shit and left so i was even more happy.  I ended up going out to the lake with him, Kathy, Kellie, Jerica, Travis, and Jessica and we had so much fun.  Wayne and i were acting almost as though we were going out, i was on his back, he was trying to dunk me in the water and he eventually grabbed me up and was holding me like a princess in his arms.  I felt so freakin happy about everything.  Well then a few days after that i was down w/ him at kellie and jerica's house and kathy and travis and a bunch of other ppl were there and we were hangin out have a good time.  Well Kellie and Jerica's mom and dad were sleeping so they told this girl stacia to help keep everyone quite so she decided that the slightest talking was too loud and said something to wayne who was talking normally and then he got pissed off so he was gonna leave but i wanted him to stay and he was sayin no cuz ppl were pissin him off and bitching at him and all this crap, and then josh called him over to talk to him so i went and sat with Kathy and told her what happened and that i felt that he was mad at me.  Well when he was done talking to josh he started looking for me and that said that i probably left cuz i was mad at him but kathy was like no she's over here and she thinks ur mad at her and he looked at me and was like what jaime baby y would i be mad at u, what makes u think im mad at u, and that got him even more upset so i told him to come sit with me and so he sat im front of me and then i proceeded to give him a back rub and he started talking about how he was stressed and everything about Robin taking the baby and about work being stressful.  Then he was telling me about how much he liked me and that he really truly liked me from the 1st day he met me and i tole him i felt the same way, but then he was like and i would love to go out with u soo much i really really want too, and its not that i dont want to ask u right now its just that its too soon for me to start dating again since i just got out of a very long relationship with Robin and i told him i understood, and then i had to go home, and we have just been around eachother and with eachother almost all the time, its like we are actually going out or almost like we are married lol.  And then today i went to see him out at Lacy Meyers house cuz he was staying out there cuz he had Hunter, his baby, and didnt really think it would be good to have Hunter at Josh's house, and when i got there and went into the room where everyone was he looked at me and smiled and i almost melted and then he was like, well hello jaime u look beautiful, and i was like thanks even though i wanted to pass out.  Well after alot of ppl left it was just lacy, jeane, jake, wayne, hunter and me.  Well Wayne needed baby formula so i took him to Jill Durbins house and stayed there cus she was gonna buy him some formula, well i took jill's bf to kroger and then to green oil but couldnt give Wayne and Hunter a ride back to lacy's cuz i was already 15 minutes late, so right now im feeling really really freakin bad but i know that he wont be upset.  So yea that's my story about Wayne, for some reason i really really feel as though im in love but i really really want him to ask me out already cuz im goin to college soon and i really want to know b4 i go to college so i dont accidentally find some boy there and end up having Wayne's love not in my live.

""Save Yourself""

These words, fall from your mouth,
and stab me in the back
It should have never come to this
Its too late, for your apologies
They can't bring back all that you've taken from me

Stripped of my pride, and left for dead
This time is the last time I take this abuse
I've found my place, and this place is far away from you
How can you say, I'm at fault the one to blame is you
Stripped of my pride, and left for dead

I'm so tired of apologizing to myself for you
And what you've done to me
And I've tried, to forgive myself for caring about you
There's nothing I can do...

Okay so there is this guy i kinda sorta a little bit like. He is cool and really sweet and all but he is the trouble maker kind. I mean i dont mind a bad boy....as long as it doesnt affect me. I like him tho but he has a girlfriend. He says he will break up with her for me but i dont know. In some ways that just seems wrong. I just wouldnt feel rite. But then another part of me says...well if he is gonna end it with her for me atleast you know who he likes rite?? well i dont know. I mean he is really sweet to me which no one seems to believe because of who it is but he IS!! haha. I guess i will just have to see what happens with us. i dont know.

Life rite now is good i guess you could say. Things are going decent for once. Same ol shit everyday tho thats prolly why. I feel the need to cause a little trouble ya know?? I just feel like doing something i know is wrong just for the hell of it! haha. well yeah neways....

Mikey is coming home next month. THANK GOD!! i miss him so much. NICOLE AND MIKEYS HUGE ADVENTURE....coming soon!! hehe. I LOVE YOU BABY!! <3

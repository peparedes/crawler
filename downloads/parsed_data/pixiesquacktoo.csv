"event","The kids at work have these 4 dolls they can play with. They are anatomically and politically correct. A white baby boy, a white baby girl, a black baby boy, and a black baby girl. However, the children refer to them as ""chocolate"" and ""vanilla"" babies, and I could not for the life of me figure out why, until today. Apparently, the makers of these dolls decided to make them scented. The white babies smell like vanilla, and the black babies smell like chocolate. Sometimes they fight over who gets which doll and I hear phrases like ""No, <i>I</i> want the chocolate baby with the penis!"" 
When they decide on a doll, they all play games with the dolls. They really enjoy entombing them in the giant wooden blocks they build with. I have seen many a vanilla baby built into a small crypt, although the kids usually say its a changing table or a crib. Sometimes they feed the babies with those little trick bottles that make it look like the liquid disappears. They don't pretend its milk or orange juice anymore though, because someone told them its actually colored liquid. Now they say ""Hey! I need to feed my baby some colored liquid!""
The head usually falls off the vanilla baby with the vagina."

"event","Today, I went to the salvation army with Christine and Vinnie...Somehow we got lost on the way there(and by somehow i mean ""ashley"") but we managed to find it. I got some awesome purple courdoroys for fifty cents, and Vinnie got this hilarious computer game about pirate monkeys, or monkeys fighting pirates, or pirates teaming up with pirate monkeys...something about monkeys and pirates--quite awesome whatever it was.


Later Christine and I headed to Worcester to visit Corey and Danielle at WPI. We got lost. Again. And again we found what we were looking for. Everyone we met was really cool, and WPI seems like a nice place. I gave Corey lots of hugs :) and so did Christine, I think we mighta overdone it a wee bit, but oh well. Seeing Corey and Danielle all settled into school and with a bunch of friends made me a little less scared about goin off to BU.

I feel like going to Canada right now."

"event","And so it begins. What is <i>it</i>? Its just <i>it</i>. Have you ever gotten a feeling so intense but so different that it is indescribable? It starts out at the bottom of your spine and creeps up slowly settling somewhere in your chest. The back of your throat begins to feel tight, like its a roll of film being wound up . Your eyes suddenly can't focus because they seem to only be looking at the visual manifestation of whatever feeling it is you're having. And the only thing you can hear is the blood rushing in your ears in quick little bursts of ""goomb, goomb"". Then it passes an all thats left is this intangible tension in your abdomen and it is sort of shaped like an X."

Yea...Hampton Beach was wickedmegasuper fun. Christine and Christopher and Chris are all still wicked cool! Chris recorded ""Sydney in October"" for us tonight. Work is really gonna suck tomorrow, and I'm getting really nervous about open mic night for a lot of reasons. 

Every once in a while I keep getting these waves of sadness when I realize everyone is leaving soon for school. Its exciting and happy and at the same time scary and depressing. Life is moving really fast for everyone, and from what I hear from grownups it never gets easier. I can't believe this summer is almost over...its been my best and my worst summer vacation so far. Everything is so confusing."

"event","2 short Chris stories.

1.Yesterday, I come home from work, head up to my room to change and such for my party, and I notice little pink smudges on my door...I think ""hmmm""...so I walk into my room, and lo and behold, ALL of my makeup is dumped all over the place, and all my strawberry lip gloss is eaten, just bitten right off. And to top it all off he pooped on my floor. He denied the pooping part, but fessed up to everything else, the little brat.

2.This morning, Christophers grandmother who lives nextdoor decided she was gonna take chris out for the day. Chris got REALLY excited, so he went next door and climbed into her boyfriends truck. But of course hes a little motor head, and knows exactly how to operate an automobile at the age of 2, so he decided to take it for a ride. He put it into drive, and smashed it into a Jeep. I asked him if he hit auntie Jillie's car, and he said ""YUP! I broke Tommmies truck too!"" He was quite proud of himself.



Hes the cutest little troublemaker ever"

But I'm excited because Mommy says my birthday is coming soon! She says kitties get presents for their birthdays just like at Christmas! Well, she says ""good kitties"" get presents. I'm a good kitty, aren't I? I have <em>nooooooo</em> idea how Sha'Ori got a bite mark on the top of her head. *innocent kitty look* And the claw marks on the couch aren't really my fault -- the couch started it!<br /><br />But my birthday is March 1. Mommy says she's thinking about baking a birthday cake for me and all my friends that weekend. *happy kitty* I hav the bestest friends, too!!!! I love them so much!<br /><br />I wonder if Mommy will get my pet sock anything for my birthday. I like my sock. He's purple and fuzzy.<br /><br />Sha'Ori had to go see the vet last week. It's not my fault! I didn't do anything to her that time! But not Shay has to take pink medicine that smells like yucky bubble gum and then eat this brown stuff, too! I watch her take it and then laugh and then chase her away for bugging Mommy.&nbsp; I don't know why Mommy likes her; Sha'Ori is just an old kitty with an additude and she's not me. I'm cute.<br /><br />I like when my friends come to see me! Dargism came to see me yesterday and Musicklutz was here last weekend and Sunnyskies02 and RaquhelnSeaElf were here. I <em>love</em> them!<br /><br />Uh-oh--- Mommy is coming back from her shower. (Why do human's shower? if they'd just preen like kitties they wouldn't have to get all wet.) I have to go.

<P>I want to send a little money to the American SPCA to help the kitties of New Orleans. Can you, my friends, help me to raise $20 in milk money to send to those kitties? Mommy said I can put a milk jug in the Center. She said a little carton of milk is 25 cents, too. If you have 25 cents, can you drop it in the milk jug?

She's 2-years-old, which means she's about six months older than me. *preens in the mirror, licks his paw and slicks back the fur on his head* Do you think she'd go for a younger man?</P>
<P>*sigh* Audry. *sigh sigh* Such a pretty name.</P>"

"event","<P>My favorite person came over today! And she brought her cousin, so I just had to bite his toes. My Meghan came over to talk with Mommy while bidding time until Mass. I was all confused because we don't have Mass in the summer. But that's okay! She called me ""sweetie!"" *happy kitty sigh* And she picked me up and I got to play with her!</P>
<P>I miss all of my friends at the Newman Center! When are you coming back? I have just Mommy to play with and then there's Sha'Ori. Mommy got a hairbrush from Sha 'cause she's leaving fur *everywhere*. Can you imagine that? But, hehehehe, I stole the brush! I made Mommy chase me to get it back. But that's good, she needs exercise.</P>
<P>It's the middle of the summer now, right? Guess what?! Mommy's friend is getting a kitty, too! I'm thinking I'll write an email to the new kitty, tell 'em what to expect from mommies and how to raise them and what they need to feel happy. Mommies just need so much attention sometimes!</P>

"event","<P>I did my favorite thing today! I played with my blue milk bottle ring. It scooted all over the floor and I chased it and I batted it and then..... I POUNCED on it. It was fun. I like my little blue ring. I play with it all the time. I scoot it across the floor and down the hall and into the bathroom and under the bedroom doors. I even got it under the stove one time and had to cry until Mommy figured a way to get it back out for me.</P>

<P>Then I was called upon to protect the house from the broom! So I attacked it in the kitchen and chased it away from under the door on the deck.</P>

<P>So that was my busy day. Mommy is thinking I need an adventure. And she keeps muttering something about ""not enough fur for a rug."" I don't understand why; I left *lots* of fur all over the house this week for her to sweep up. I thought she *liked* the fur. I just don't understand humans.</P>
<P>So what kind of adventure would be good for a kitty to go on?</P>

"event","<P>I did my favorite thing today -- I sat in the window! And I watched my friend the chipmunk running from under the porch steps to under the basketball hoop. He was chewing on something. Then I watched Mommy do office work on the deck and she talked with some man who wanted her to type things for Peace &amp; Justice. Then I sat in the other window and talked to the squirrels.</P>
<P>See me in the porch window and that's my friend the chipmunck. I don't know why I can't have him for dinner.</P>

<P>I think tonight I will take my pet sock and climb on top of the fridge so that when Mommy walks by, I can jump down on her head. She likes that.</P>"

<P>My name is Luca David and I live at the Newman Center. I snuck on and got my own LJ so I could tell all my friends what I'm up to while they're away from school.</P>
<P>Today, I stalked birds from the kitchen sink. Mommy says I can keep any bird I catch. Then she laughs. I don't know why.</P>

<P>In the meantime, I tried to play tag with Sha'Ori, but she hissed at me and ran away. But it's been a pretty hot day.</P>
<P>So, here's my journal. I promise to update when Mommy's not looking. Please be my friend. I miss all of you!</P>"

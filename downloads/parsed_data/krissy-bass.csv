I'm definately going on a diet because if I get asked to prom (I probably wont) but if I do I want to be able to fit into my dress! (my mom wont buy me a new one so I have no choice. I hope I get to do something today because yesterday was a waste of my time. Instead of sitting around and drawing I should like excersise or something, but I'm like super lazy.

"event","I dont know what today was. That girl that Adam likes turns out to be really...well people dont say nice things about her.  Katie's bf went out with her...and Adam's sister and friend said stuff about her and they didnt even know Adam liked her.  Now I'm the bad guy because after they said something about her walking, I said like ""Isnt that the girl Adam's in love with?"" and I really really really didnt mean to say it but it came out and I'm SO sorry I said it but it was like a brain thought that comes out loud.  I'm so sorry for it...and I was on his revenge list already. I guess I was so mad because I always get the front on the way home....and one of my biggest uh...I dont want to say enemies...but the person I dislike second most in this country comes and sits in my seat, turns the radio all the way up, and totally hangs over Adam. *sigh* Well...what can you do. Other than that it was a great day...and I'm really ugly... 

Another thing that bothers me is when the people in my ACC CHEM class treat me like I'm a freak.  Today we had a comprehension thing from the whole year and there were 18 questions right? So I get a 17 out of 18 and everyone's like ""Ya, that's just because she's a genious.."" I mean...they say it every time I do something correctly...like I can only do good because I'm a ""genious"" even though I'm far from it..I just happen to remember.

I feel so guilty though...Like...I hardly feel guilty for the little things after I apoligize for them..but I'm SO SORRY I did that to Adam...what can I do?? *sigh* For the first time I've met him I feel like I've been truly evil to him...He trusted me with the fact that he liked her and I went and told everyone in the car...I feel so evil...*sob* What do I do!! I'd kiss his feet and apologize if he was here...but he's not. If he did that to ME I'd cry...and I went and did it to him without meaning to...*sob* I hate myself...

"event","Today was a great day for April Fools Day! In our Geometry class two hardcore cross country girls played a great joke on the teacher who's also the Cross Country coach. Well, last year one of the girls was made to stop being in Xcountry because of her psyco mom, and the other girl hurt her leg last year. Well, this year they're like the most important people on the team right? Well, one of the girls came in with a cast thing on her leg, crying and everything..like real tears...well Mr. P (the coach)  was really upset about her ""broken leg"".  Well, then the other girl comes in and she's like ""P, I cant be in track anymore...my mom says, will you please call her and talk to her?"" well, Mr. P called the girl's mom and her mom was in on it too! So then later after lunch the girls both come in really depressed like and the girl with the broken leg brings in a ""doctor's excuse"" and he opens it up and it says ""April Fools P!"" and he like almost had a heart attack because he was so happy that it wasnt real!  Well, at lunch time today, me, Brittany, and Jon decided to play one on Adam because he's been such a jerk lately. Well, we had our friend Breana write a note back and forth to Brittany pretending she was someone else, and Bre pretended to have a major crush on Adam...she said she saw him at a dance and liked it or something. Well, then Britt showed Adam the noted and he read it and she's all describing this ""mystery girl"" who Adam was supposed to meat afterschool. Well, I was going to have my friend Emily meet him there and tell him April fools or something, but she wasnt up for it so we just ended after we went out there and she wasnt there. It would have been better if everyone would have cooperated, but they didnt so :(. Well, it's such a beautiful day out today!! So purdyful! My sister's outside talking to her new ""bf"" now. She has a different one every other day...I dont understand. Well, I must be one with the wild, so tata.Then on the way home Adam saw his sister in the back of this druggies car and she was trying to hide from him but he saw her so we followed her all the way into Rock Falls then one of the druggies she was with came out and yelled at Adam and he's like ""You have my sister in ur car, I need to talk to her."" Well, these people got mad and drove away...it was pretty funny.

"event","Yea, just another day in the boring life of Kristen Dinae Bass. Nothing normal. Adam wanted to dance with this girl at a dance but he never got the guts to ask her and now our friend Alma's playing messenger to her and the girl's about to break up with her boyfriend so he wants to ""move in"". I feel like crap now. Oh well...life must go on. I have to dream if I things could ever stay the same, and I really must be dreaming if I think that I, Krissy, would have someone that was attracted to my o-so-bland personality that is the ""trait to insult"" this year, and I definately cant catch them with my stupid appearance, so what's left for me? I guess I'll have to become a nun. Wouldnt that be special? Well, a Nazarine Nun. I can start a new trend. Everyone that thinks guys are the scum of the earth can join my little nun place and we can all live happily, without those stupid sex-hungry creatures we call ""males"". There really are few with good traits. I want one that's smart (but not smarter than me, because I hate feeling stupid), one that has an obsession with anime like I do (and doesnt mind the occasional drooling at my bishounens, especially Tamahome and Setsuna), someone who likes playing fantasy games (like FF and Star Ocean), someone that's innocent (no druggies and drunkies and sex-hungry pigs), and someone that will like me for ME, and not make me change myself before they'll love me. Plus, I dont want them to get sick of me. :( That's like majorly mean when the're like ""I dont want to go anywhere...I'm sick of you..."". That hurts...it's happened to me too. *sigh* I love dreaming. You can do whatever you want. You dont have anyone telling you what you cant do, you just dream and everything's perfect. You can create your perfect little world with your perfect little fantasies and nothing can go wrong. Same with drawing. You can do whatever you want...anything at all. There's no restrictions. You can create the perfect people with no problems and no sorrows who are always happy with everybody and everything that they do. There's nothing that they want to change about themselves. Unless of course you like drawing the sadder things, like I sometimes do when I'm sad, and whenever I look at it I can remember what I went through and how much better it is now. If I can remember my emotions, I can remember how to fix it so I dont feel them anymore. But it's hard to change love. It really is, because you cant make yourself not love someone, it's in your soul, and no matter how hard you try, you'll always think about that certain someone and whenever you think about them your heart will skip a beat, but also sink to the bottom of your chest because you know you cannot have them or see them again (if they're gone). Well, I think I've pretty much buchered the whole point I came to make across to myself today...I was trying to make the point that it's easy to fall out of love, but really, it's not, and it's like the number one factor to...well...alot of trouble in this world. Alright, well, I have to go now because my fingers are curling up into a little ball from writing for so long. TTYL

One thing funny did happen though. My friends Brittany, Adam, and Stephanie went to pick up Stephanie's friend Ricky...and this is Brandi's brother. Well, they went to Ricky's house and Brandi came out and started yelling at Adam (for what I did...it must have made her hate him) and Brittany's like ""Uh...this isn't Adam...it's my friend Andy."" and she's like...""Oh, I'm sorry, where's Adam (there were a few unmentionable cuss words in here reffering to Adam and how much she hated him)"" and Brittany's like, ""He's at his GF Emily's house."" (he doesnt really have one) and then Brandi's like ""Oh, well ok"" and she went back into the hosue believing it wasnt Adam. Well, he got so mad because she was like sitting there bashing him and saying all these things about him and he just stared at the speedometer with his eye twitching because...she was saying some really bad stuff about him and she didnt even know it was him. I thought it was funny in some sense since she finally doesnt like him anymore and I dont have any problems with her now, because I technically didnt do anything wrong. :D It's pretty cool. Well, g2g

"event","Things are going better! I got a little payback last night on some girl I dont like, and she's been mean to me for a really long time....so just a little revenge isnt too bad right? I mean really, I didnt do anything wrong...I just told her it was weird how Adam never called her back because he usually calls people back and stuff that might make her suspect that he doesnt like her. (which he doesnt, he's trying to ignore her which is why he had me tell her stuff while I was on last night). The person who my sister liked for like a long time is going to our dance tonight and she's super jealous. That's the girl I got revenge one's brother and he's also being sent as a spy for her. *shudder* This sounds so strange. I'm trying not to use names because in the off chance that you guys know her I dont want you to say anything...because she doesnt know it was revenge...even though she knows I cant stand her...but anywho. I had to meet at the library with our group today for our project so I woke up early to go do that. And now my dad's trying to pester me into staying home tonight to watch my brother!! I mean like...! It's my dance! And we're all supposed to go out before the dance too and and I dont want to be left out like I always am *sniffle*. Hopefully my dance goes well, though it probably wont, but we'll see how it goes. TTYL and peace,

"event","YOU GUYS! I didnt have a bad day today! It was actually pretty cool :) I dyed my hair a reddish-brownish color (basically, it looks reddy purple) and bought tickets for the Spring Fling dance. (Actually, it was Adam because I had no money so he payed for me and I have to pay him back) and I had like no homework today, I just drew pictures in most of my classes( in which I usually always have homework) so it was pretty cool. I helped my brother with his Yu-Gi-Oh game because he wanted ""big purple headed sister"" to help him. I watched Miss Congeniality today. It's such a cute movie. I did it while I got my hair dyed though so I didnt get to see all of the ending :( I havnt seen that movie in a long time so I forgot alot of it. I get to go to an art show next week :):D!!!  I think it's in Mendota or something like that. I think I already said that also...hehe. Well, cold and dog's barking to be let in so I gotta jet, plus it's almost past wittle Kwissy's bed time (which is strictly inforced by Krissy and Krissy alone) lol. My eyes are falling asleep, if that's at all possible...
Thanks Sam for all your support *hugz*

"event","It's so beautiful outside today, I just had to say it. It's supposed to get up to like 68 degrees:) I love spring, it's the best time of the whole year. Brittany was really mean to me yesterday. Me and Adam went over to her house to say hi and stuff cuz she had been gone all weekend and she's all ""WE actually had fun, since you werent there whining all weekend..."" I didnt even do anything!!! So much for a welcome back. Adam must have noticed her moodyness to because he's like ""Someone's in a bad mood..."" and he wouldn't say it unless she was being REALLY moody. Well so we drove around for a bit and ate some Taco Bell (yum) and stuff, and drove around with the music all the way up, windows down.  It was pretty ok. Then I came home and went to sleeeep. But I woke up at 2:30 and couldnt get back to sleep till 5. When I'm trying to get to sleep, it's the most ANNOYING thing because I'll just keep THINKING..about like everything.  Then I'll think of something I have to do and if I dont write it down I'll forget it so I have to get out of my comfy bed and write it down somewhere...I'd rather just forget most of it...but I cant get to sleep anyways. *stupid wandering mind* I hate it! *glues wandering mind to side of head* NOW IF YOU DONT STAY PUT I'LL HAVE TO STAB YOU WITH A Q-TIP!! There, anywho, it's 7:20 and school starts at 8. TTYL

"event","It's still really sad :( Last night we went cruising around (because he got his car back) and I could tell it was still botherin him...I mean...who WOULDNT it bother?  I stopped by before he came to pick me up and he looked like he was ready to cry. :( He's trying to hide it though, but I dont want him to burst into tears from holding it back. We're suppposed to go to the movies with everyone tonight. Hope they can come:) I got my room redone yesterday and it looks really nice :) I got a blow up bed so it's soft, but I have to put air in it again every morning :( There's holes in it or something already. I spent all morning reading manga and a book we had to finish for school. Chobits is the cutest manga I've ever seen ^_^  Other than that, my day was pretty uneventful so far. I'm trying to clear some old entries off of my geocities site so you guys can sign my guestbook. I've gotten my sister obsessed with Manga too...Chobits and Fushigi Yuugi. :) I am SO the queen of Animanga. :D I'm just sitting here doodling because my computer's going really slow and it takes like 5 minutes to go between the pages :S Thanks for reading my stuff Sam :) I think you're the only one that visits me. Oh well, I'll prolly read this in a month and think I was absolutely loony :D Well, need to get back to downloading anime and fixing my guestbook. Ciao!

"event","For all of you who dont know this, Owen is my ex-boyfriend. We didnt really fight much after breaking up, but last night when I went to him for help with the Adam situation, he started being very rude about it.  He's full of himself, and he thinks he's better than everyone else.  That's just how I feel. Just because after we broke up I wanted him back (for like a month) he thinks I'm in love with him or something, when I couldnt care less about him.  It was pretty funny, because Adam went and talked to him and after talking to him, Adam says ""He seems...gay"" I guess it was just funny to hear. Here are the emails he sent me after I blocked him...

Alright. First of all, let me clear this hypocrite thing up. The whole quote thing I used is amazing. Don't deny it, it is. 

You said it was not. Now, this is what pissed me off. I enjoy the quote, and you should too, as it's deep and insightful. Your screen name is not. The fact that yours is from a song and mine is as well is IRRELEVANT. It does not make me a hypocrite. Stop making false assumptions. It's annoying. 

Second. You come whining to me about Adam. I try to help you out. I try to comfort you by saying he probably won't do anything. But no, you decide to do what you do best: play the hopeless despairing visionless hypocrite, and disagree with me. 

I've already done more than I'm inclined to do. And that isn't good enough for you. You want more. And you can't be wrong or denied. That would be far too painful for you. Like facing the harsh realities in your own life. 

You're a leech. You take and take from everythig, including yourself (which explains your health situation) and as SOON as somehing takes from you, you bite it's head off. 

You complain about what I've ""become."" It's only natural progression. What YOU have become, my ""dear"" is definatly not an improvement. 

-Owen 

So you really only have 2 options. 

1) Unblock me, and trust in my verbal skill to craft an equally eloquent forgiveness and retarction 9cuz we both nkow you can't do it yourself) 

2) Forget about me. Forever. I doubt that's even possible, as I'm bound to creep into your mind every now and again, weather you like it or not (as you into mine) and start solving your own problems, and actaully ACCEPTING a solution instead of hiding behind the self-invoked ""don't blame me"" shields you put up so forcfully in front of yourself. Sometimes, you WONT get your way. As you havn't with Adam, as you won't if he kills himself (which he won't. I already talked to him. you're welcome. I told you he wouldn't, though I doubt you'll believe me, even STILL) and as you won't if you continue to be this shadow of yourself. 

You were once very dedicated caring and loving. Get some self respect and dignity. Maybe you can win it back. 

-Owen 



Now what do you say to that? I'm very upset...but in some parts he's right. He says I was once caring and loving...but so was he. I guess it was just an act for both of us. Well...he's wrong about the remembering thing. I've made it so I can block out traumatic moments. Maybe once a month when he signs on I'll remember who he is. But it makes me feel good to know I'm remembered. This proves that he doesnt want to lose my friendship. If he would have blocked me, I would have just gone on my merry way. But he spent alot of time and thought on that email. Ok. I'm going to stop talking about Owen and move on to more important things.  Adam left for Indiana today, and he'll come back tonight or tomorrow (Hopefully tonight, because then we get to stay out late because on Sunday, it's a school night) And Brittany went to Laura's dad's house last night, so for this weekend I'm pretty much stuck alone. For the girl that died, last night I just took out a piece of paper and DREW. There's this angel wing over this girl's face, and she's sleeping in a bed and the feathers of the angel's wing are on her pillow and the angel's off to the side crying and looking at her. I'm going to add more...but I'm not sure what it's going to be yet. I also have a final project to do for art and I dont know what I'm going to do for it! I know it's going to have an angel, a girl running, some roses, some weeping willows, a forest, a lake, pond, or river, and I dont know what else.  Any ideas would be helpful :) Well, I'm going to end it here, as my day progresses, I'll probably enter again.

"event","Hey, this is my first time entering an entry on here so I hope all goes well. First off...I went skating with my cousins today...what a JOY that was! *cough* All these little kids were watching me draw...I'm not that good. They act like I'm Rembrandt or something. But when I got home, I got the worse news I've heard in a while. I got news that my best friend Adam's love of his life died in her sleep! I was crying for the longest time...he really loved this girl.  I cant stand seeing my friends in pain...especially my best friends. I didnt know what to say to him...His love just died...what do you say to that?  How do you help them?  I've been told it's best to give it time...but how do you do that while trying to fix it? I'm so helpless to do anything...there's nothing I CAN do.  At this moment he's calling all his friends in Texas to see what they're saying. Things like this arent supposed to happen.  They're not BSing him...this is so serious. I think I'm going to die.  I know I never knew her...but I heard so many things ABOUT her. Anyone that he loved must be really special. He compares it to me and Owen when we were in ""love"". I guess it's the same. She's dead (physically) but the Owen I knew is dead too (mentally). He wanted to marry her...he WAS going to marry her. I dont understand how he can put up with all the stuff he does. SO many bad things have happened to him...and it's no wonder he doesnt believe in a God. I'm glad I can try to help though...even though it doesnt do much good. Maybe I'll give another entry tonight...but I dont know.

"event","I do hope I don't sound like a complete ignoramus when I didn't mention my father's recent death, in fact, I acknowledge it calmly despite the <I>execrable</I> news.  Really.  It's quite upsetting to hear about your <I>lovable</I> father's death, especially in perilous times such as these.  I do hope mother is doing well, though.  If she knew how to configure a computer, I would send her a note.  Unfortunately, owls are not allowed to be originally parted from Azkaban, so, I'll just have to talk to her when I leave.

I would like to thank the anonymous person who sent me three books not so long ago.  I have finished <I>The Peloponnesian War</I> and <I>The Making of the Wizard of Oz</I>, but I'm still regarding the third (which is <I>Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America</I>).  I think I'll read that at a later date.  

I do think the gaurds present are jealous that I have something to do while they have to sit here and pretend to be doing labour.  Azkaban is quite different from what I heard it to be.  Of course, that's with the absense of dementors.  

Theodore, please contact me when you have time from your busy schedule at school (I'm sure).  I have something important to tell you."

"event","I don't know how long I've been thinking; Days, perhaps?  Weeks?  Months?  Simply more than that.  Try years.  Years of hard, hard thinking that has left me breathless and feeling even more worthless than imaginable.  It's unbearable, but I deserve it.

The last time we talked.. a week ago, at the most?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  Stupid, really.  He was drunk, apparently, but still managed to type on the computer.  To me.  ... They made his house into a pub.  Disgusting and terribly barbaric in my opinion... he loved the house.. the location.  Again, my fault.

I shouldn't have never, ever gotten with him.  It was a mistake from the start.  I can't get him out of my head, and it's driving me <I>insane</I> knowing what I can and cannot do, what my limitations are.

Most of all, should I, or should I not.. talk to her?  

... It would be simple.  Quick.  Hopefully painful.  ... I think I'll talk to her."

"event","And I don't mean that in a good way.  This is horrible - what happened today.  Saraneth, I do not blame you at all for the incident, I promise.  Gudgeon, your help is appreciate immensely.  

It's my fault entirely, for getting in this mess in the first place.  I should be there, with my son, right now.  By his side.  It's my fault entirely and I'm a horrible Father, because he is there without me.  

I feel like a failure.  

Damn it."

"event","Like Lucius has put it, someone is angry.. extremely.  

Dropped this computer thrice in the last hour, nearly breaking it on the second drop.  All the parts are still intact so that makes me feel slightly better.  

My entire body is numb, I swear."

"event","As the subject suggests, I am getting old.  Old enough, in fact, that I dropped this laptop twice in the last seven hours (thankfully not injuring it - if one would call it that), my son has forbidden me about talking about his sex life (lack thereof I hope, for a long time) and David Gudgeon Instant Messaging me (Which I literally rubbed my eyes and wondered if they were deceiving me).  

Thy name is Thomas Nott, and I am old.  Thankfully, am human still.  And sane.

I have implied that Saraneth sent the blanket to me, though I'm quite sure who really sent it.  Subtle words were not always good with him, anyway, which is fine with me, though.  

Saraneth has told me of her talk with Bellatrix Lestrange... the name itself tempts my body to shiver by itself, much like the Dark Lord's name.  Crucio is her best friend, of course... 

Saraneth has also told me of an interesting past story involving a certain man... I do hope things find her well.  She was always a good companion, above most others.

I'm off to read now... 

This blanket smells like him."

"event","Thanks to my son, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/wizard_theodore"">Theodore</A>, I now have a computer in my possession.  Which is much smaller and ... more portable, if you will, than what we used all those years ago in school.  It still makes these little sounds like always, and it blinks green (not sure if this is a good sign, but I will take it as such and will be aware that it's working perfectly).  It seems like only yesterday when I first started using this thing.  It brings back good memories.

I was informed by <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/wizard_theodore"">Theodore</A> that my wife has left him alone at the Manor, much to my displeasure.  It makes me wonder sometimes if your mother chooses to ignore me purposely (I will believe this) or if she's just a bit too dim for my liking (I will believe this as well).  I disapprove of you, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/wizard_theodore"">Theodore</A>, being left alone there.  

Hm.  Everything is quiet now.  I guess everyone is asleep.  What I would give to have someone send me my <I>Oneirocritica</I>.  Theodore, send me that by owl post next time (It's in my study, third shelf, last book.)?"

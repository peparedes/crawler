Crispin glover! I met him at the Playboy Mansion, and i about shit myself when i saw him! he was unbelievably sweet and genuine and got a kick out of me telling him how much my brother and i growing up LOVED George McFly. He couldnt have been more of a gentleman and i couldnt have been happier :]

a couple weeks ago, he took me the scenic route to the santa monica peir, because i had never seen it. we spent a really sweet night walking the boardwalk and enjoying the crisp winter night. my heart cannot put into words how special he makes me feel...all the time.

this weekend we spent a hilarious funny amazing time in vegas. from start to finish it was just one crazy adventure after the next. drinking yard margaritas in the tub filled with bubbles, strip clubs, beatles show, making fun of how crappy and repative pop music has become and missing the way it used to be..trying to go see donny and marie..up until getting home when i realized the baggage man left my fucking MAC makeup case...i was fucking flipping out, ALL my make up, ALLLLL of it, mac and all, my brushes...my JEWLERY that my mom and of course David got me were all in the fucking case. not only that, but if a chick was to see a mac case just sitting there with no one around, consider that shit STOLEN. i couldnt believe that, how i just let him take care of that case KNOWING it wouldnt be a good idea. i was loosing my shit, thats a lot of money and make up just GONE. G-O-N-E! of course david blamed homself and i told him it wasnt, so we call the hotel and told them to call us if they found it. i was beyond upset...my jelwery that i cant get back, just fucking gone. i came in my room to unpack and david leaves and comes back to my house about 15 minutes later with MONEY! TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS!!! he was planning on buying me my make up back. of course i could/would never accecpt that, but the mere thought of him trying to help me blew me away. it just made me cry more at his generosity. i could never take his money but shit...who does that? for ME? he called the hotel back and they said that it was left on the luggage cart, and that they had it there. THANK FUCKING GOD!!!!  hopefully they mail it back to me with EVERYTHING in that damn case..

MOOOOVE BITCH! GET OUT THE WAY! thats all we knew,AHAAH!!
anywhoo, i sat on the head rest of kimmels side stage lounge chair while he was sitting in it..so after MOOOVE BITCH was over, david called to jimmy) who greeted us with a smile, and david told him i was some broad from the Howard Stern show (who kimmel was a fan of) to which he lit up and said, ""HOLY SHIT!!! wow!"" david milked it, i played along...kimmel was SO FUCKING NICE, SO NICE! to which he was nice enough to do this

but seriously, who would go to their ex's wedding, or someone who you were in a relationship with, shared things with. loved...still love and will always have that place in my heart, she meant a lot to me, and i didnt feel like it would be right for me to go, i just didnt want to. now, thinking about it, i should have, for her. just to support her, like she would have done for me. i havent heard from her since...nobody really understands what im feeling about this, its just..crappy. we are really good friends still, but at the same time i couldnt sit there and watch her get married. i dunno. yet i feel bad i didnt.
now i wish i was there, life is too short for selfish agendas
she was a huge part of a portion of my life, in the role she played
and even though i feel like i need to justify my regrets, i dont.
im not wrong for not going, and im not wrong for feeling bad that i didnt go
so im stuck in the middle of the shitty in the middle feeling 

even though i know she was longing for someone to love and last i just dont feel i agree with that being the reason for rushing into marriage, who knows, maybe she <i>really</i> is happy, regardless of how it turns out, ill always be there for her from now on

i dont know what it is exatcly that i miss so much, our friendship, or that time in my life, that ENTIRE time i didnt expect to end as abruptlty
i find myself missing her a lot, knowing that we could never ever be what we once were
i miss all of it, i miss how it felt to be with her and how special we were
that feeling of love a type that i cant really word or describe, and it breaks my heart so much that its one that was only meant to be felt once, only in that specefic period of my life
nobody understood me or looked at me the way she did
it was too good to last forever, yet i know it could have if she would have just balanced her new life with the one we shared togeher
moments that were so incredible..emotional and intense that will never be forgotten, in my heart at least
i couldnt imagine myself caring or loving someone the same way, ever
you chose to let it fall away, that you couldnt find a way to share your life..you chose to leave me, like an old doll that you didnt need around anymore, one that sat and stayed loyal to you until my button eyes slowly started to unravel until i could no longer see you..that things never really ended just...went away...slipped away
i couldnt hold on any longer 
yet i still wonder what you have made of yourself, and hope you are just as happy if not happier than the time we shared. that life is everything you ever dreamed it would be and that youre out there smiling...and that hes good to you 
i miss you so much, i just wish you knew, i wish you knew how much i will always care 
and love you
always

almost a week and im still sick! i feel like complete crap, im so tired of this. i dont know what to do. i went to davids this weekend but ended up staying in his bed. litterally, i couldnt move. luckily he was sweet enough to take care of me and rented us movies. i just felt horrible, i still do. i had no choice but to drive my ass home today. i was so scared i was going to fall asleep or pass out at the wheel, i should have jus stayed there another night like he wanted but i thought i was going to be getting up for school, thats not in the cards anymore. i havent been this sick in years and years and its starting to scare me. i wish o was there there, its always at least 10 degrees cooler too.
hopefully ill be okay by the end of the week so we can go to Universal's Haunt. Oct is my fave time of year, however it just doesnt feel  like it. it came too fast."

"event","okay this is going to sound strange and unusual, that im jealous, and get mentaly/pyshically ill over a dead person

let me explain

so david's ex girlfriend died a couple years ago in a car accident(him and i were already together), im not sure if it was before or after Monira but i remember being weirded out by it then, and that i didnt have much sympothy

cruel? well, she cheated on David with his COUSIN, in HIS house and that was that, he always told me before she passed away that she was clingy, and didnt have any drive, but she was a good person blah blah blah(i also remember my friend sarah and i clobbering her at Chain shows when she would wear open toed heels in the pit and had the nerve to whine and complain that people were stepping on her, needless to say that we made SURE we stepped/trampled/hit ALL OVER That dumb bitch, this is BEFORE i knew who she was, BEFORE I was told she was Davids girlfriend) ANYWHOO afetr she and him broke up, the broad hooks up with Dallas! yes, suburban Legends Dallas, to make him mad.

okay 1: cheating is NOT okay, cheating in your house does NOT make you a good person, hooking up with your friend out of spite makes you repulsive! am i right?! or am i right?!

he tells me that he was destroyed over it when she did it and he didnt let himself get close to anyone for a couple years, until i came along
then after she dies, which by the way he tells me he was over her before hand, he didnt love her but was hurt that someone could do that to him. He tells me that he regrets not setting things right with her, just as a ""hey we're cool"" type thing, he'll say that ""its something that i will never get past"" granted when i tell him about all my GENUINE regrets and things i never got around to say to my MOnira he comes back at me with that shit, okay, monira NEVER did anything like that to me, all she did was love me and gave me one of the best friendships that i will treasure forever,  and i feel like when he brings up his ex at times like these i want to punch him. i know his feelings are justifiable yet at the same time, how in the hell am i supposed to take that??! how do i repsond to that?! 
like tonight, we were talking about my family situation with my brother and his wife, and he was compairing it to how his mother promised not to meddle in his love life after his ex, he told me that after she cheated he told his mom and she called her a SLUT!(lol)knowing she was just saying it to make her son feel better..and david got mad at her! explaining that he couldnt get past his mom calling her that if they were to ever get back together, SEERIOUSLY, WHAT THE FUCK?! 

i just dont know, i feel like this person that doesnt exsists anymore has this..i dont know, power over me, and always will..it fucking bothers me, like as lame as this sounds but how the hell am i supposed to compete with a dead person?!!!
OH! OH! and when we talk about going to SL shows, i tell him i wouldnt know what i would do if i saw Chris and his wife, that im ready to put it all behind and just say hi or something but that im scared to...he freaken tells me, ""well at least you still can make ammends, i will never get to"" SERIOUSLY?! i dont know why i let myself get all worked up over it, that someone that is gone still has that...its a very weird feeling, and im confused to what i should and shouldnt feel. 
because im insecure and its something that i cant change, its the weirdest fucking feeling, im jealous of a dead person, when he brings it up it makes me cringe and want to throw up, i just get so upset, if she were still alive, like, what would he have done differently? when we were in our relationship and she was still alive would he dwell so much? why am i doing this to myself? whats the point? all these crazy ass scenarios and shit come up that drive me nuts!
idont know how to approach it to him, i know that he is intitled to his feelings but at the same time, i dont dwell on chris(anymore) to him, its done! i feel selfish but it does make me feel like shit sometimes, that her actions would still let him get mad at his mom for calling her cheating ass a slut, SHE WAS! 

UGGGHHHHH i dont know, it drives me crazy sometimes, and i dont know how to not let it get to me, i know he loves me and that doesnt scare me, but i dont know, this dead girl will always be lingering and it kills me"

like having a hard day and just wanting to fall asleep with him, holding me

missing him so much throughout the week and just wanting to see him when i walk through the door

it grows each time i see him, as if that wernt already possible to love someone so much as it is!

Just a rainbow of children, something i have ALWAYS dreamed of doing. (or i can just have a secret love child with Vince Walker...lol..)so so adorable!!! i hope it happens someday, we'd be awesome parents. :] knowing us though, our biological kids will have some sort of mental problem or a deformity from all the shit we talk on people...or should i say, from all the people we make fun of. ahhhh only time will tell..

i have also become increasingly insecure again, i have been working like a mad man in the gym trying to tone up. and i am starting to see things on my body that wernt there before, and that have come from eating/drink SHIT. it scares me...i mean im sure most of it is in my head but its something i have always dealt with that comes and goes quite strongly. The Playboy paty is comming up and thats making me even MORE paraniod....
..we're going to universal this weekend, and theres no way in HAIL that i can stop my bad eating/drinking habits at that place, oh well. but its not just physical insecurity, i sometimes feel comepletlet inadequit, and that david will find someone to trade up with..its a big fear that someone will take him from me, irrational, but there none the less...insecurity spouts BLOW..blow dogs for quarters

the ORIGINAL 90210 was the GROUND BREAKING Show that allowed the others to exsits. it STARTED all your ""one tree hills"" and ""OC's"" and the other worthless crap shows that are around today. why go backwards and try to remake magic?! 
 
why take such a historic gem and fuck with it?! it makes NO sense!!!! the kids that watch those shitty shows today have NO CLUE what it was like in the 90's watching it, and there is NO WAY it could live up to what it was, not only that but....

i hope im not the only one that feels this way, that show meant the world to me growing up, its a shame that this is happening.....

BRENDA, BRANDON, KELLY, DYLAN,DONNA,DAVID,STEVE, ANDREA

and for shame on the people actually comming back to try and revive their careers on this, they esp should have had enough sense to let a good thing be and not screw it up with a shitty 2008 edition...the 90s were a special time and thats why it worked, because that show, the ORIGINAL was the first to adress certain issues and show them on tv.....

<center><small><font face=tahoma>I haven't written in quite some time.

Now I must speak in terms of school life. School is, surprisingly, going great. At least better than I would have imagined it would. I really like the smaller environment, and though there have been a few problems with my service learning in the past, overall it's pretty neat to be out helping others. It gives you a really great feeling knowing you made someone's day just by doing something small. ;]


Classes are going better, I am a weee bit behind, but I'm earning 5 to keep them alive! Hahahah. I'm hoping to get my independent learner's card at the end of this progress cycle. That would be splendid.


Pasta is now currently burning me a Slapstick CD. I am really excited. They are a pretty kick ass band.


Okay, I must go now."

<center>liars. 
cheats. 
unthoughtful. 
self-indulgent. 



Except for a select few whom I've yet to meet. 

On the other hand, 
I always tend to forget about what I want to accomidate 
who he is. I believe that is where my downfall begins. 


This boy should be honest no matter what the circumstances. 
More than anything, I cannot stand people who say things just 
because they think it's what people want to hear. 

This boy will love me for my flaws as well as my strong points. 
He will know that no one's perfect and he wouldn't have it any other way. 
Not only will he be understanding, but he will also help me pick up the pieces. 

This boy will hold me when I'm upset and kiss me when I cry. 
He'll do all he can to make things better. 
And even though it might not fix it, I'll feel better knowing he tried. 

He will acknowledge the fact that I, indeed, have feelings. 
And he'll try hard not to hurt them. 
He'll know I'm strong, but sometimes I need help. 

He will be able to accept that I do get jealous. 
And he should be flattered. 
It's NOT because I don't trust him. 
I simply want to be with him constantly. 
Also, bringing up his ex-girlfriend is a no-no. 

This boy should know that I will never tolerate cheating. 
And if you have something to say, say it. 
I hate suprises. 


His eyes will never wander and he'll call me cute names. 
I'll know he's mine when our knuckles interlock. 

He'll know I enjoy the simple things in life. 
Extravagent things have never made me happy. 
Although a token of his affection wouldn't hurt. 

He will make me promises and never break them. 
He'll understand that my heart is fragile and it's the only one I've got. 

He will tell me I'm beautiful and actually mean it. 
I also don't mind being called gorgeous or cute. 
But he'll never call me ""Sexxxy or Hott"" inless it's intagonistic. 

I like to wrestle and call people names. 
He'll know that I'm only joking and he'll play along. 

He will know my insecurities and try his best not to 
insult me or make them any worse. But to make them disappear. 

All I want is to be the one that he wants."

<small>So, this week has been fucking nuts. I'm in class with Meg, and for odd reasons, I can't stop thinking about one person. It's driving me to my last nerve.


Saying yes, when you ask me if I still want to be with you is like complying to rape. I know you're going to hurt me, but I'm weak and defenseless so I just go along with it. No reason in fighting it, when you know it's going to happen right? Fuck it and fight it, it's the same thing And for you, special person.. I only have one thing to say:

You can say all you want,
<b>I just can't trust you with my heart.</b>


I really want a relationship with you, I could honestly see us being together and happy just like we are now. I just don't know how much longer I can wait for a response from you.


It's not that I'm afraid of running away from you, I'm just scared you won't run after me.

<center><small><font face=tahoma>Ughhh, this week blows asshole. I got ditched by Mari and Heather over the weekend, which in reality I can't be too mad about it. I have done something of the sort to Mari in the past. Hmph, whatever.


I'm in class right now, and I'm not liking it. We're not even doing anything.

Whooof yesterday I got stuck in Island Lake yesterday so SARUHHH GOREGASM and Jason picked me up, and we had to drive this kid home to Wisconsin and we passed the gay town and yelled at people. It was tooo fun. Then we went to the mall and ran into Eddie and Jeff. They tagged along with us and we went to see Borat. That movie fucking rocked my balls off. Ahhh, yes. Then I came home and Anthony fucking called me. I don't know what that shit's about. But whatevvvsss. That's it for my night, I suppose. I miss Jason. =[


Grrrrr Mrs. O'neill speaks with her most sinister discussion of anal-ass grammar which eats your fucking soul for one hour fucking day nonstop and there is no end in sight everr never ever until your fucking eyeballs bleed out of your skull and they have to clean it all up with that motherfucking red sawdust stuff and even then you have to listen, so you have to jam pencils in both of your ears and I'm sure you'd find a way even then, wouldn't you, Mrs. O'neill? you baboon.


Ugh one more fucking hour of excruciating agony and I'm fucking outta here."

I've been hoping things would get better. Karma is coming to bite me in the ass. I've done a lot of crappy things in my lifetime. I want to take it all back, but I can't. Ricky was right, I <u>am</u> just a hurting little girl who's looking for something.. but I'm not exactly sure what yet.


That night, he told me I'd eventually find what I was looking for, and it hasn't happened yet. Ugh, I hate it when people lie to make me feel better.


I need to really start going on walks or something. The leaves are so pretty outside, oh man I wish my camera worked. I could get some beautiful pictures of fall. ;]]

Sorry, that was very random. But it's really how I feel right now. I can't describe it any other way. My student teacher can suck my balls. [I'm very angry with her.]

My throat is sore. I have a pounding headache. My allergies are acting up because of the change in season. I have a fever of 101 degrees. Oh, man.. I'm pretty tired.


Well, this past weekend was nice. I got to see my friends in Island Lake, and I made up with Mari. I love that girl so much. Ricky gave everyone massages, I told Zakk off finally, and Adam called me on Sunday. I got to spend the day with him practically. I'm really happy he and I are talking again. He makes me a happy kiddo.


Jeremy is getting on my nerves. I still don't know why he hates me so much. Ehh, whatever. I'll just have to live without ever really knowing what the hell happened between us, I suppose. 


I'm gaining Ryan's trust back, that's a good thing. Apparently, I need 20 brownie points to fix what i fucked up, and I already have 12. YAY! I'm almost there!



Well, I'm going home. I don't feel so good. My septum is pretty, I must also add. I'm going to get my yearbook and possibly hanging out with Bunton later.


That's about it for my agenda."

<center><small><font face=tahoma>I've come to the realization that when you think too much, it starts to hurt.  


And in case you were wondering, my last statement was completely general. You can think about anything, obviously. But when you think about it constantly, it starts to irritate you. It grows inside of you. You let things get to you, and it brings you excruciating agony. 


No one wants to be that way, I know. There's a way you can stop it. And I'd like to share it with the world:


<b>STOP GIVING A FUCK ABOUT TIVIAL THINGS.</b>

1. Don't worry about other's opinions, the only one that counts is yours.
2. Minor problems that shouldn't effect your day ;; LET THEM GO.
3. If someone doesn't like you or something that has to do with you, TELL THEM TO FUCK OFF!


Really, people. You have the ability to change the way you feel. You have the strength to push away the things you don't want or make you unhappy.


So please, stop bitching about how your life sucks. No one is going to want to hear about it, and its not worth talking about unless you get off your mopey ass and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, god dammit.


I learned all of this the hard way, this is kindergarten for you. Take this advice and learn from it. Or don't and be miserable for the rest of your life.


The choice is entirely yours."

<center><small><font face=tahoma>I apologize for the first entry, for there was no introductory statement, whatsoever. 


<center>Hello, there. My name is Jen Burton and I am keeping this LiveJournal to get my feelings out, remember past events, and for the favor of my Team Leader at school, Mr. Patrick Kain. [TEAM KAIN REPRESENT FOOOOLS!]


<center>I feel very content today. Franko isn't at school, Monika is at service right now and she's getting surgery on her mouth. I feel so bad for her, because every time I see her, she can barely talk because she's so messed up on pain killers. But, on the other hand, it's kind of cute. 

<center>My camera broke over the weekend. My mom is picking me up from school and we're going straight to the nearest Canon store to drop it off and get a new one. Also, Mrs. Meister is going to record my debut on the morning announcements to a blank DVD that I brought in so my family can see me act like a moron.


<center>Hopefully, I can get my computer soon. I miss myspace, and updating my iPod. I miss music. And I hate going out and buying CD's. 


<center>Rolling Meadows homecoming is this weekend. Megan is coming out here and going with me and the gang. It will be nice, considering we both don't attend Meadows anymore, and we can visit together.


<center>Well, that's about it for my ramblings today."

<center><small>Today is September 25, 2005. It would have been my one year anniversary with Jeremy. Sure, I can say I miss having him in my life, but that's only because I'm so used to coming home from school everyday and hearing his voice. I'm used to the 4 hour phone conversations we used to have, the laughs we had throughout the year, the pointless arguments, the jealousy, the whole works. It is very hard to contain a friendship after a relationship like this, we have been through a lot. I hate feeling this way every day. I feel guilt and remorse every time I think of him. But the one thing I am proud of is the fact that I have moved on from all of that. I appreciated everything Jeremy gave me, good or bad. And I realize things didn't work out for a reason. Everyone has someone out there for them. It takes time to find them, and you have the rest of your life for it. What's the point in crying over someone who doesn't want to be with you? So today, instead of moping around thinking ""OHHH GOD I FEEL LIKE CRAP TODAY WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE YEAR"" I think, ""Today is just another day.""


And I hope to continue on like this, because I realize it's for the best."

this quarter than I can really fancy. I am actually massively
worthless, as I have come to determine. In other news...I hope you read
this, kat. *ahem*:<br>

"event","Cool, i have a paper due in 14 hours and I do not give a shit. Fuck the evil dance bitch whore, I don't care if I fail. Why do you think dancers are poor in the first place? And I'm not talking about student groups or people who are hot, I'm talking about ugly forty-somethings doing interperative dance in black and white. NOONE GIVES A SHIT IF THEY AREN'T HOT. So STFU and be seated, kthx. Anyway, you're probably asking - 'hey, sex poodle <- (insert alternate pet name you have for me in bed here), what the hell are you doing on your livejournal? Well, i'm bored, i need strings for teh guitar, xbox is boring, i have no books to read, i'm not in the mood for tv or porno, i am sufficiently groomed and i already drink/go out too much. That's right, you guys are special to me. So henceforth livejournal will resume at least until tomorrow when I shall naturally forget about it and move on with my actually valuable life. Therefore, without further ado - what's happened in the lonely state of illinois this year?

Sometime in September/October: Arrive in USA. Disgusted with sweet food, politics, airport cues and 10000 renditions of 'omg where are you from'
/aroused by attractive american girls who have not seen any of the heinously embarassing things i have done in high school.

October -> December: Drunk, some Theatre stuff.

December: Came back to find friends have changed but remain the same in some ways. Miles is still a n00b, Sitting-Fat is still immobile, ladies still seek vengeance upon my soul for the countless 'wench' comments.

January: Return to find rushing frats is pretty cool. Drunk + Xbox, wake up with the letters 'Phi Kappa Psi' written on my arms in my own handwriting.

Sometime in January: Have convinced theatre girls i am too much of an alcoholic, and begin to lose faith. Accidentally stumble into high school MUN and am mobbed over accent. Return to thinking I am god's gift to women.

January-March: Am pledge. Hazing nonexistant, greek guys and girls definately my type of style. Miles, you would approve. Starting to remember I go to school, therefore I start going to classes. Annoyed when teachers ask if I am actually in their class.

March -> June: ?

Last week: Realized I was in school again, resolved to go to class once more. Woke up tied to couch the next day after getting high and trying to eat a roll of toilet paper.

Obviously this is an overly broad description of an American college but you get a fair idea. Now I am looking forward to going back to D-Town and kickin it wit my homies. And Miles. I will see you all in a week, you weirdos who came back weeks ago well screw you, it ain't a real party without Andrew.

Peace my peeps. Actually, that sounds retarded. Later all.
Andrew"

You're the perfect combo of innocent and sexy.<br />
At times, you seem a bit naive, simple, and innocent.<br />
But at second glance, you are sensual, seductive, and even a little naughty.<br />
You have people fooled - at least you'd like to think so.<br />
<br />
Those who like you enjoy a contradiction.<br />
Either that, or they can't really make up their minds about what they want.<br />
And you can usually give people what they want... as long as you're in the mood.<br />
You've been known to be quite tempestuous, and pleasing others is not high on your list of priorities.

"event","well, i made it through another new year without killing anyone(though i had to fight to surpress the urges), and i didn't even cheat by spending it asleep. i went out in <i>reality</i>. and survived. i still hate new year. i stayed up all nite playing board games (i blame slev), got to bed around half 12 yesterday afternoon and slept for 21 hours- a new record for me. though i did have a 3 hour break for breakfast at 1am, but only cos i hadn't had anything resembling a meal for 24 hours before that. sleeping pattern needs fixing. i still blame slev.

i bought new pyjamas, they're pink. they feel wrong but they were the least ugly ones in la senza (it had to be la senza cos i had gift vouchers). the old pyjamas are at least 3 years old and have recently developed a giant hole in the backside. they served me well :(

since i'm here i've dragged out my old guitar. i need it for a perplexcity card. i'm trying to learn to read guitar tab, seems simple enough.

i'm tired and hungry"

i'm gonna see iron maiden in december. again. of my own free will (tho i suspect someone's influence at work here). and i'm even paying for my own ticket. i should bring toast. at least it's in manchester this time.

slev, you owe me for your ticket. which i'm more than happy to accept in the form of something black and shiny <----*unsubtle hint here, look!* =D

"event","this week i learned that dropping my phone in a puddle is not the way to make it behave. i've bounced it off the floor many times over the years and it's survived, this time it tried make a break for freedom. and was thwarted. it should consider its delicate self lucky i got to it before the bus wheels did. so i may or may not have to buy (as in, pay actual money for!) another phone/clock/personal brain organiser, but i'd rather this one didn't die. at first i thought it had gone, but after it dried out it worked fine. today it's been mostly functional, apart from the screen freezing and total battery death. i never let my battery die, it isn't a good sign.

not much else has been happening. i think i should stay away from the solventy things at work, i hallucinate too much these days. slightly worrying. oh, and i went to see coheed and cambria last month and never got round to posting about it afterwards. all i'm saying now is ""so gooooood""

what's that you say? sleep? ok, why not. hope everybody's shinypeachy happychildren x"

"event","I like to watch people.  As I was walking through the park today i saw a guy walking WHILE reading the newspaper.  Every couple of seconds or so he would look up and make sure he was a) walking in the right direction, and b) not going to run into someone or something.  Personally, I would rather hurry to the nearest parkbench to sit and read.  This way, youre not having to look up (to see where youre going) and have your reading be interrupted every few sentences or so.  Maybe the guy had class or something and didnt have time to sit down.  That's efficiency there people.  Yep, not me.  I dont actually try to get something done when I'm walking, I just walk.  It's my time to not have to thing about anything really, just that I'm going.  That and take care of my daily 'people watching.'

I encourage you to take a moment today or tomorrow and watch someone.  Then realize that someone could be doing the very same to you...

"event","I was walking today, and I began to wonder again about people with mp3s etc. And i was thinking about how it is sometimes nice to just listen to whats around you, like natural music. As I was walking through the park to the physical sciences, I heard a girl say, ""Do you think that Gary's more important than me?"" Then a guy I passed said, ""So he ended up sleeping next to the patio door?"" These small snippetts of an individual's complex life interest me. If you ponder about the compexities of your own life, from your childhood memories, to your adolescent self consciousness, to your everyday thoughts, and multipy that by the millions of individuals in the world, you have a truly massive, entangled web of personalites or life experiences, whatever you want to call it. It's quite profound. It makes me feel small. But yet, it's comforting in that you know you're the only you. It's aslo exciting to wonder where your particular thread will go in the entangled web of life"

the last couple of days have been really intellectual. i feel like im getting smarter.  Especially since i've come up with a couple of clever film ideas.  Im excited.  Oh and i met someone that is really into my ideas and could help me with writing a script.  I love college

I have the great idea to compile a contact book with all the people i've met in order to keep contact, almost like a resource book

this week was a relly good week.  besides the film stuff and meeting a collaborative partner, i talked to a cute guy in one of my classes, and i waved to our cute neighbors.  yay for reaching out to the outside world

Anyway, summer is here and I'm ready for summer bbq's and cute boys and hanging with girlfriends.  I'm sad that our 2nd year has already come to a close.  It's all going too fast.  Pretty soon we'll all have jobs in the ""real"" world...ahh, I don't even want to think about that right now.

As for a re-cap of this year, it was a lot of fun.  Halloween party at our place, SATC nights, box office fun, reed's b-day, 8 am stats classes and more...  I really felt like I was able to get to know people better, which makes me excited for next year...woo woo! I'll be at home in Temecula for most of the summer working, but I'll be back on weekends and for the month of september.

  I was really stressed last week, but as we get closer and closer to spring break, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I think I'm going skiing in Mammoth over break, oh yeah!  I can't wait for that.  For those of you who don't ski or have never tried, do it.  There is nothing like the sound of snow under your skis.  It's so beautiful and serene in the mountains.  Yeah, it's good stuff.

  On a side note, people watching has become my new favorite hobby.  Not to creep anyone out or anything, but I just love to watch how different people function: the way they move, walk, talk.  It's so interesting.  I suppose it could have something to do with being an actor,  but people just fascinate me.  

  For my theatrical literature class we read The Cherry Orchard, by Anton Chekhov.  A great play, I really liked it, for anyone looking for a good read.  It's a smart juxtaposition of drama and comedy.  I'd like to do a film version of it one day.  

  I think I worry too much about what happens after graduation.  It's so hard, the uncertainty is so annoying, like a stupid rock in your shoe.  It sometimes gets to a point where that's all I think about and I forget what I'm doing here, now.  Then I feel terrible because if I'm not focused on school, then I'm cheating myself out of all that I could be learning.  I am here for a reason, aren't I?  I enjoy being here, for the most part.  Those term papers suck booty.  Anyway, I guess I'm in a sort of ""let's-question-everything"" phase.  

  I guess if I even have time to be doing questioning, then I should probably get to doing some homework-ing.  Blah.

I love this season and all that it means.  It warms my soul.  I am in this perfectly content state of mind and everything is beautiful, everything is perfect.  
     I can go home and wear my pj's and cuddle up next to the fire with my warm cup of cider while Christmas songs dance in the background.  Oh and baking!  I love to bake, there's something so satisfying about it.  I mean you combine all these carefully measured ingredients, put them in the oven, and whalah!  You have this beautiful, delicious concotion that exists because of your doing.  It's magical.        
     The only downer about the holiday season is the hordes of people you have to battle who are all wandering around searching for that perfect gift, while you yourself attempt to do the same.  But I guess it's ok because it only happnes once a year and it also makes for great stories.
     Friends.  I love seeing all my old friends over the break.  We always have good times remembering our golden years and wishing were were still in High School.

Sometimes I don't understand time.  Even though it continues at a single, steady pace, it still inevitably seems to vary.  When I'm at school time goes by so fast, there's never enough of it.  Yet, when I go home for the weekend, I feel like I have all the time in the world.  Maybe it has to do with our state of mind and it's perception of time.  Stress = less time, relaxation = more.  I don't know.  Pondering over it won't change how much time I have to read tonight for homework.  

Sweeny Todd... A good show, a little weird, but a good show.  It had it's slow moments, and some equally lively ones.  Beware of ""The Ballad of Sweeny Todd,"" it will haunt you, in an annoying way.  

Nevertheless...I look forward to the weekend, despite it's craziness.  It always feels good to get something done.

"event","Well, all I can say is that Jason Mraz is THE most talented, entertaining, and gifted musician ever.  Oh, and did I mention that he is HOT!  Wow...  

Ok, so I went to his concert on sunday in Claremont.  When me and my roomate get there, we see our friends who we knew were going too.  When we go over to say hi, our friend Jen said that she had 2 extra meet and greet passes that we could have.  (She won a button design contest and got free tickets and passes)  Needless to say I was stunned and excited at the same time.  Jen, you are an angel and I cannot thank you enough for your kindness.  So,the Jason Mraz signed autographs and took pictures with us as we talked to him.  He was the most laid back, easy going guy ever with a subtle yet smart sense of humor.  Oh and, he's very HOT and a gives good hugs.  After that we returned to our seats to watch the show.  I just want to say that his voice is as somooth as silk, I could listen to it all day.  He is incredibly talented at skat singing and crooning, something that few people can REALLY do.  His lyrics are smart; not just words on a page, but a personal story.  He has an amazing ability to improvise too.  In the middle of the show he started singing about how he had to pee, and then ran off-stage.  When he came back he started to sing about how much better he felt.  But, yeah, he is a brilliant, intelligent, amazing musician who can't be fully appreciated unless you see him live.  Going to one of his shows is an experience like no other.  If you don't know who this man is, find out, you don't know what you're missing!

Thus, my weekend was absolutely amazing.  It was like a dream.  I keep reminding myself that it really happened.

All I can say is ""WOW."""

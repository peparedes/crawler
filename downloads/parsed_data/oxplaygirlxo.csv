"event","I didn't really get to ENJOY having today off.. i got up at like 7 something and got ready then at 9:30 I left to go to the eye doctor. Nobody go to Dr. Casto... EVER! he's mean! and he seems to enjoy stabbing your eyeballs! i hated him! but anyways.. i came home after he told me my eyes where good. i was still really dialated so the sun made my head hurt really really bad, so as soon as i got home, i went to bed. i slept from 11:30 until 5! so then i got up and talked to sarah and kate for a few minutes then sarah called me. i talked to her for a while then i got off to eat. after i ate, i called laura back and we talked about her date tomorrow night and i looked in the 2003 yearbook for SA and i was trying to find the freshmen in there.. i never did find it but then we realized he wouldn't have been in there at all anyways. man did i feel dumb. lol.
after i got off the phone with laura, i got back online and changed my layout and talked to kate for a few more minutes and talked to justin<33. i love that kid! 
i just realized i don't have anyones adresses to write them while i'm in school. if u wanta keep in touch with me while i'm gone for 6 months then i'll need your address. 
and with this all said i'm gonna go to bed! night!<33"

"event","okay.. it's been a while since i've updated so i thought i'd update. i finally got a day off work for thanksgiving.. my first day off since last week. it was a VERY BAD day at work. then thanksgiving day.. i had to get up and get ready and wait for my mom to come pick me up to go to my grammas for dinner. i was mad about that b/c i missed dinner with my daddy. so then while we're sittin there she was like .. ""so i'll be there to get you at about 9 for christmas"" so i was kinda confused why she wouldn't be there at noon just like its been for 10 years now. and she said it was christmas eve and i was uber pissed off b/c i told her a week ago that i was NOT leavin on christmas eve. all my life i have had christmas eve and christmas morning with my dad and step-mom and this year shes tryin to ruin it like last year. which everyone knows im not afraid to stand up to anyone specially my mother.. b/c last christmas eve i freakin cussed her out for ruining my christmas and everyone else's.. but anyways.. now i have to go with my mom at like 10pm christmas eve.. b/c i'll be back the next day. ugh... i hate it when my step-mom talks me into stuff.. lol. so then lastnight i found out that im not gettin anything for graduation.. not even a graduation party or anything. also.. the weekend that i get to come back to SA from military school... is when my brother will be graduating. so they are goin to his graduation and i don't get to come home. don't that suck.. so ive been kinda depressed lately just thinkin bout things. the reality of this is hitting me and kickin my butt.

..i really should be gettin to bed really sooon since i have to get up at like 4 tomorrow morning.. but i don't really feel like sleepin right now.. lol.

we did christmas decorations lastnight. so now our trees up and we have a huge grinch too. i told my step mom she shoulda just put a hat on my dad and put him out there.. haha. 

well i get off work at 2 tomorrow so if anyone wants to go hangout then let me know :o)  nighty night kids.."

I've only worked with this one guy at work for 3 days.. and i am already startin to like him! he makes me smile! and we play around all day and pick on eachother non stop. the bad part is.. i know i can't get involved with someone i work with so often, that may cause both of us to lose our jobs. and i'm getting ready to leave for school. I've liked someone ELSE for a while now.. and only Kate knows who it is, and i'm not going to say anything. i know it would NEVER work out.. and he's not even my type! i dunno why i even like him! ..but i do.. i'm just gonna let things go.. whatever happens.. happens for a reason.. so i'm happy with that :o)"

tomorrow i'm going shopping with my step-mom. i'm pumped b/c i haven't been out since saturday night when i went to blockbuster. i'm gettin released friday from the surgeon so if anyone wants to go out friday night then leave a comment.

""Have Todd take you"" and ""I'm so tired i can barely keep my eyes open."" so i gave up hope of him goin. which is crappy b/c it takes me right back to my last entry. i can never rely on friends when they say they wanna go do something, but when i try to then they don't wanna make plans. at least ashley actually wanted ta go. so when i come back from KY on the second, we're gonna go do stuff.

I'll never tell someone I love them or show any love for someone, b/c it seems to fall apart. Yeah, Peter and I broke up, and I hope everyone is happy now.  i've been thinking about this more than i've ever thought in my entire life... and i just love it how he can just change his mind within just a few days... and i don't want to hear ""i love you.. i really do"" kinda bull crap, b/c i don't believe in love anymore. and i'm giving up on it. yeah, soounds harsh and you might say I'm just saying it and i'll change my mind. maybe i will eventually... but not any time soon. oh well i'm out. bye."

"event","So yeah, things aren't working out... once AGAIN.  This is so aggervating. I'm ready to stop trying and let everyone else wanna do something then make the plans and tell me what they are last second so i don't even have a CHANCE to get my hopes up. I haven't seen my boyfriend in a freakin WEEK!!!!!!! and looks like it's gonna be ANOTHER freakin week!! 

..Not to mention the fact that I was SUPPOSED to get off work at 4 o'clock today.. and Dan needed the day off, but I couldn't cover is entire shift so I stayed there til 8 o'clock. There was a game so i was already aggetated, Then Evan tells me that Dan had called him and told him his plans. he was going out with his g/f to the movies and such. Dan told me that he had missed math class and was meeting up with some chick he has class with and gettin the work and he was gonna have her help him with it. I hate being lied to. 

well i'm gonna go. anyone wanna go do somethin? comment if ya do, or IM me."

"event","i had to work today, again. and i was also sick today, again. pete's still sick, not cool. i haven't seen him since LAST SATURDAY, DEFINATELY not cool! I'm getting upset over this 2 days a week thing because i think it's kinda silly, that if somehow i tend to have 3 days in one week, that takes away from my 2 days the next week so i have ONE DAY!!! I guess all I can do is play parent slave until they change their mind.. lol. 
..Something else I can't seem to understand is WHY they let my little sister... who let me add in that she is ONLY 12 YEARS OLD, went to a football game BY HERSELF! I wasn't ever allowed to go with friends or even my brother, let alone by myself, (not that i would WANT to) so how is she any different??
and yeah, i've been trying to make plans with my boyfriend but of course he is sick and i have to work EVERY freaking day of the week, and when i AM off, he has school or something. i just wish i could see him soon before i go completely in-freakin-SANE.  but anyways, i'm gonna go take pills. goodnight."

"event","Well today has been rather amusing. My drugs wore off between 5 and 6 am so I woke up, couldn't sleep, so i basically layed around for 4 hours in my bed trying to sleep,which really sucked.  And I called pete, he's still really sick, so that kinda brings me down. My brother is going to take his girlfriend to Homecomming, hope they have fun. I wanted to go, so that pete and i can go out that night, i'm only allowed one night with im this week but if we went to h/c then that's 2 nights this week. but pete don't wannt go because of all the freshmen, lol. I might volunteer to work jus so i'm not stuck at home with my rents =\. they are looking for people to work that night anyways.
My mom is comming to town this weekend and if i'm off work, I'm going to go to Kentucky Sunday or Monday and unpack my room, help plan for the party. it's really gonna suck but it's better then nothing sitting here bein bored... =\
but yeah, i'm not in a good mood and i can't breathe... so i'm going to go. bye."

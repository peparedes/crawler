i am an idiot. 
lo siento.

i don't want to work at all today. it's been rainy all day.
stupid.

next tuesday is ""senior ditch day"". that means all seniors are excused from school.
this makes me happy. i wish it was monday though, then i could have a long weekend.

i miss you a lot.
i want to go on a vacation with you. somewhere not too fancy but somewhere nice enough so that we can leave from there saying ""man...now <i>that</i> was nice.""
&i want you to be really happy with me the whole time we were there. no stupid mistakes of mine.

when you come this summer we'll go to chicago. 
we will room together.

i drew this today in english class. i haven't finished it yet.
i want to write this in the open space above the date:
<i>love is like watching a thunderstorm pass on a bridge: 
on one side, the sun sets and shows it's beauty, 
and on the other, the storm rages and shows it's strength, size, 
and intensity.

all together, it makes the most beautiful thing in the world.</i>"

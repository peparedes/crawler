"event","just one more half day! even though this is my worst exam day. i have english and math.
this is pretty much what went on today, i went to school and played kitten cannon and other mindless games for my studyhall exam. then i did poorly on my spanish exam so im not off to a good start. i got home and left again to return all of my dads beer cans. we got 40 dollars at 5 cents a can, figure how many beers he drank. then i was going to go to work today so i can do something tommarow, but then i needed to do my outline thing today and then work would have to come tommarow meaning i would arive late to ali's house. but then i didnt have to work because she did all the work herself. so now i can do my outline today and go over tommarow. its all very confusing but it all works out.
on sunday (father's day) my family plans to go to a brewery and he can sample beer, his favorite thing to do! and im left home alone that day, so talk to me if i can come and do something, please!"

"event","I went swimming for the first time this summer. I tried 4 different people but nobody has their pool open yet, stupid people its 85 degrees out. so I eventually went to lake Wyola. swimming included three jammed fingers and a cramp in each leg, fun fun."

"event","well i'm officially kicked off the computer until school ends, due to grades and all. so to recap the past five days: i went over alice's house to have a water balloon fight, which turned out to be very short but fun. we showed off our amazing donkey kong skills and i tried on some indie clothes for the first time in my life, and i got some very good comments. i might have to try it again sometime. something exiting just happened, there is a little secret compartment in my nightstand sort of thing that i never knew about. so i looked in and i found about $55 and a load of candy. so if anybody wants to do anything, its my treat. and thats all i can remember at the time. and my mood will be hot for the next couple days, untill i get my air conditioner."

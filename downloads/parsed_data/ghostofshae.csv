"event","wow. inspiration is a cool thing. *adapted from an improv poem i created earlier in the evening*

hi. my name is shae and i am a recovering poetry addict.

it started innocent enough that's for sure.
i'd only read on weekends and holiday at night in a locked room where no-one could hear me beg for more.
i used to just chew and spit, just to taste you know.
but as time went on i learned that tasting wasn't enough and i had to have more, i'd bite huge chunks of it off and swallow.
in school i started taking it in pill form.
in the locker room before track i would sneak it from my locker and drink it like a poison, i could feel it slide down my throught happy and warm.
it wasn't long before i started smoking it.
great volumes of beat, classic, gothic, and new age vocabulary began to choke the bronchial arteries of my vocal lingustics.
i'd soon start to take it in the bathroom during lunch break.
and i'd go to my next class, not having eaten, mind you, reaking of cassidy and rice and burroughs and poe, and the kids would whisper among themselves ""is he allright, look at his face.""
i got so bad i used to shoot it in my veins.
i got tracks marks all over my soul and everyone around me became infected by the kind of second hand influence that they'd hit me up for some beau siegh or saul williams.
i'm clean now, better than ever now.
i take a white pill everday.
better than ever now.
i've ben off junk for more than a week.
better than ever now.
and they test me for increased knowledge every day.
better than ever now. or so they tell me.
and i dont even want it...

kay so i lied, i shoot up anthology after anthology in the park everyday. i dont eat at lunch break anymore, i ingest all my lit at night, i dont sleep!
i'll read poetry in public and protest wars and quote george carlin! but i'm not ashamed of it any more!

aw who am i kidding? give me Kaurouc and ginsberg and stuff me so full of poems i cant walk straight. let me smoke the pot of williams and let me shoot the meth of buroughs untill im so teakin and stoned i cant tell up from down, night from day, naked from clothed, or homosexual boy from heterosexual girl!
i'm a poetry junky!
and i have to have poems! 
and i'm not afraid to use/abuse/misuse/deal/buy/trade/or sell them!

girls who have really small writing in long sentences written across the front of their shirts and then they smack you for 'staring at my boobs'
girls who have stuff like 'naughty, bitch, or sexy' written across the butt part of their sweatpants and then they smack you for 'staring at my butt'
guys who shave their legs

13 yr old guys who have pillow fights and shave their legs together while listening to the local alternative radio station playing blink 182 and other such ""punk"" music
stinky shoes
girls who are loud and giggely ALL THE TIME
early mornings; that is, waking up early in the mornings

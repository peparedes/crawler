"event","Well, Idlewild was generous and gave me this beautiful Thursday off, isn't that great, thanks Idlewild! LOL Let's see, what happened on my day off?   Well first I went to lunch with Maggie.  It was loads of fun because Maggie is awesome and we always have fun when we hang out.  I'm curious to way Lacy did not join us, we called her.  Oh well, it was still fun. I believe I had the steak and cheese LOL. (just getting technical) Then afterwards I went and saw a special person.  I actually got to see Jake today, it was exciting.  I'm very pleased that i got to hang out with him this evening, it was enjoyable : ) thats all I can say...I enjoyed my visit very much : ) After my great evening, I went to my sister, Michel's house for a little while to hang out.  That was pretty cool too.  My sisters are totally awesome.  Most people can't say that their best friends are their sisters, but I can.  They are great.  After going to Michel's, I came home and cleaned my room, which hasn't been done since I graduated High School, over a month again.  It looks much nicer now; I almost forgot that I had a white carpet LOL
  So, that was my whole entire day, and it was great.  It was probably one of the best days off that I have had all summer.  Yeah for today LOL    Later ya'll"

"event","Wow, today was so bad.  I am so sick and tired of stupid pissy shit. Just a news flash for everyone....I'm NOT in third grade anymore, most of us aren't, so STOP acting like you're 5 years old.  I mean come on now.  Most of us, well my friends and people I talk to are Grown Adults, so how about we stop getting mad and pissed off about stupid shit and Grow Up!! Honestly.  Even though today sucked and I wanted to kill someone, I had a good time with Ashley.  Ashley (Big Z) and I had such a fun time. ""Who wants to kiss people that don't kiss good?""  Good question, honestly Ash.  Also it was so funny when this little boy (not really TOO little, he was about 10 years old) comes up to his mom while she's paying and says ""Mom, I have to take a poop"" HAHAHA< we laughed our asses off, it was great.  
Well that was my day in a nut shell.  I'll have to make sure to keep this journal more updated.  Talk to you all later."

Just kidding, I like my job, everyone is great and the store is looking good.  So, hopefully the rest of the summer will continue this way, while we play dodge ball, Counter pong, and Flinch two punches LOL  I am going camping tomorrow with my good friends, Heather, Kristen, and Lois.  That should be good; four girls going camping and having no idea what to do.  Just kidding, we're not ""technically"" camping. We're staying at a Cabin which has a kitchen, bathroom, TV and air conditioning; so we're just sleeping at a little house tomorrow night LOL.  I can't wait though, we're going to have fun.  Well, I hope everyone has a good week starting tomorrow.

"event","Wow, it's been like, forever ago since I wrote in here.  I guess a good bit is new.  Well first off I'm not longer a highschool, June 3rd I graduated from good old Derry Area. I'm working constantly at Idlewild, I'm the new General Store Manager.  I'll try not to let you down Christin (By the way, when is the next party? :) ) 
 Everyone in my store is great. Ashley is a lot like me, which is so great and strang too.  We have the same kind of humor and think so much alike.  Lacy is the one how looks innocent and sweet and always smiles, but once you get to know her she'll rip you a new one.  She's frisky and harsh, it's so funny.  Stephanie is the quiet reserved one.  She has her moments of funny things to say, but she's so very nice.  Last we have Mark.  Mark is a smart ass like me and soo funny.  I thought having a guy in the store would be werid, but I'm so glad we have him.
   I'm still looking for the guy of the summer.  I don't know who it will be but I know I need one.  Let's hope he's nice & cute.  Well hopefully I'll get to this more often, until then, everyone have a nice night and a great tomorrow"

"event","Hey all.  Today is going pretty well. First off, I got the highest score on the Computer Math Exsm, which is awesome b/c I suck in Computer Math.  Then it was Senior Night for Softball.  We played Greensburg Central Catholic (The undefeated team in the Section) and Won 3-1. Which means they are no longer Undefeated cause we Kicked their Ass!  So, that was the perfect end the Senior Night.  I can't wait b/c I only have about 12 more days of classes left then on June 3rd, I'm a High Graduate.  I cannot wait. 
 I hope everyone is having fun in the beautiful weather. Peace out"

I just feel better that Idlewild is coming up and I always find someone there lol, and I have more chances now b/c I'm 18 : ) Softball is going ok, we may make play offs, which is cool.  I only have about 20 more days left now of High School which is Awesome.

"event","So, my song of the day is Ironic.  The part that says, ""I met the man of my dreams and then I met his beautiful wife"" It seems to explain my life.  Whenever I think things are great and that i can exactly be happy for once, something happens and it all gets taken away from me.  So, it's unfair that my personal happiness is kind of a game.  It's like God dangles something so wonderful in front of me and right when I almost have it he pulls it up and says ""aww, little Ashley, you make me laugh, thanks for the fun."" I'm not blaming God at all for my sucky life, I just think it's funny. LOL So sorry if I'm being a little too depressing for anyone, I don't mean to be, I'm just explaining to you all my life story lol."

"event","I am very tired today. I ended up spending the night at my sister's place b/c you just had an operation done, I didn't mind, I just didn't sleep in this morning. 
  I finally finished my History Term paper today which is awesome, b/c it's great not to think about it anymore. Everything is smoothing sailing from here on out.  Only about 24 mores school days left, which Kicks ass. 
   So, Rachel (my sister) and I were talking the other day, and decided that I'm destined to marry a guy named Jake, I may not know him yet, where ever he is out there in the world, but I will marry one.  But we also came to the conclusion that there is a club out there called JAA- Jakes against Ashley. It seems that every Jake I have known so far has hurt me.  I mean, I always fall for them, then I get hurt, so I'm guessing they meet once a week and talk about the what they can do to make me sad LOL.  If anyone knows the exact schedule of these meetings, tell me, b/c I would like to sneek into one and hear what is said lol
  All thats left about me is Softball, which is going well so far.  We are 5-1 in the section so far.  I hope all the games we have this week go well.  
  I hope everyone has a good week."

"event","Hey everyone.  Everything is going...ehhh.  Yesterday we had a game against East Allegeny, we won, I believe the score was 10-4.  We are undefeated in our section, that is until tomorrow.  I really want to believe we can beat GCC but it's going to be SOO hard.  I really hope we do well.  
 So, does anyone else agree with me that boys are mean and nonunderstandable (if thats a word at all)?  I think so.  I like boys, but they always make me sad.  I don't know if this one is trying to make me sad, but if he is, he's doing a good job at it. I just wish I could find someone I could relate to and be with. I'm not wishing my life away, I just wanna know that maybe there is someone out there for me.  Heaven for bid I be perfectly happy with someone, even for a short amount of time lol
  Enough of my complaining.  I hope everyone had a good day and has a great tomorrow.  Peace out!"

  Today was another day that has come and gone with no hear say about Jacob.  I didn't recieve a letter yet and he still hasn't called.  My guess is that he's been really busy and knows that I'm at school all week, so is just going to call me on Sunday.  I hope he does, I'm becoming soooo worried about him and Stacy.  I never seem to mention Kyle.  So, everyone, there is a guy named Kyle overseas with Jake and Stacy who I am also worried about.  He's 24, tall, blonde hair, a cutie and he has the funniest personality ever...and he's single ladies ; )  Just thought I'd mention that too, it would be nice for him to come home to a nice girl lol.  
  Well I hope everyone's week is going well so far.  I just hope mine gets better."

"event","Well, all though yesterday was Easter, it wasn't the happiest day for me.  I was told on Saturday that Jake was serving in some kind of new job in Iraq (no longer working with my brother-in-law Stacy) and I wasn't told what exactly he was doing, it was a secret thing.  Then on Sunday he was supposed to call me, but he didn't.  It's now the end of the day on Monday and I still haven't heard from him.  By no means am I upset with him for not calling me.  There could be a billion reasons to why he didn't, I'm basically worried about him. I wouldn't care if he would just call me and say ""Hi I'm fine,"" and hang up.  I just want to be able to hear him and know thats he's okay. So, right now I'm just worried and a bit saddened.    
  I hope everyone had a good Easter."

It hurts to see all these American Soldiers being killed by the stupid Iraq people. I don't like war, but I say if these events could be stopped just by nuking all of Iraq, then we should.  It makes me most mad/worried, knowing that Stacy and Jake are over there. It's also hard to know that I won't be able to hear from Jake until Sunday.  I was told that he's doing all right now, but I'll just have a better peace of mind, if I could hear him say it himself.  I pray that they and all the rest of the men overseas are well and that this war ends soon.   
   Well, everyone enjoy their Easter break.  I know I'll at least try too myself.  Peace"

But then everything turned around b/c I actually got to talk to Jake on the phone.  He called  around 3pm and we talked for only about 10 minutes (thats b/c that's the longest he could have the phone).  It was so great to hear his voice.  I cannot wait for him to get home, I miss him a lot.  He's so amazing, I just can't wait to see him.

He's the cutest baby in the whole wide world, but after 10 hours I think every baby is the devil LOL.  He just turned 1 in February and he's always smiling.  He's never bad, and his facial expressions are great.  But like I said, after watching any kid, I don't care who it is, after 10 hours I'm very ready to say I don't want children for a very long time.  Also, I give credit to all single parents, you're a God sent lol.  I would never be able to do, today, everyday by myself.  That would be nuts.

I have to babysit in the morning so I'm stuck being at home early in the evening.  Even though it sucks ass, it gives me time to think, which I need to do.  Now, a question for everyone.  If you think things will eventually get rough between you and a person, should you even bother getting into the situation in the first place?  Did that make any sense?  I don't think so, ok, here's what i mean.  If you like someone and they say they like you too, but you feel like it's only going to lead you to heart ache, should you try it out anyway?  Take that risk?  I'm afraid too, but I don't want to give it up, just incase it all works out.  Well, thats what I'll be thinking about tonight.

I don't mean to offend many people when I say this (people from Derry), but I can't wait to get the hell out of that school, this crappy little town and almost all who roam it LOL.  I'm excited for IUP and for the summer.  Which by the way everyone, you have to come visit me...I'll be at the General Store : )  Well, thats about all that I have to say today.

Then right before having to go to softball and practice for 2 1/2 hours I had to do 20 laps in the pool for gym class.  Just when I thought my day was the worst, I got a message.  Though i was not home to recieve the call, it was the thought that counted.  Jake, who is in Iraq right now called me.  He used his minutes and time out of his day to call me.  I thought it was the sweetest thing in the entire world. We haven't known each other for a long time, and he shows me more attention then some guys over here.  Whats the problem there? LOL, A guy who's overseas in war shows more desire to be with me, then most guys over here in the USA.   Geez, do I know how to pick them or what? LOL

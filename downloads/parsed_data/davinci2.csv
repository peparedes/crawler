"event","Well, another uneventful day searching for jobs, I'll grant you its Sunday - still ive been up all night here sending out resume's.. its looking a bit bleak... 

A thought just occurred to me - cheese is something I like very much, shredded, chopped, melted, you name it, if its got cheese ... I love it. 

You know, since the beginning of this paragraph and the end of the last one, I left my desk for a bit, to fetch a soda- of course you would not have had any way of knowing that. so I decided to tell you, normally this is no great feat, however the time in question I sustained an injury gathering said soda. So upon receiving an unlikely injury during the gathering or fetching of beverages it is ultimately necessary to advise others of your hard times.

what?     right.      Its late!        Or Early?            

Yes              I        Am                      AWESOME!"

"event","Went to a wine tasting today... 3 wines, private affair - not that im complaining, since It was free for friends of the Host. The Host purchased several cases of different kinds of wine... where as his friends simply sipped quietly and watched with eager, ignorant eyes...
I got to learn a few things about different types of grapes and where the wine is made and that there are 13 seperate german regions of classes of wine - 

Got to watch Operation Dumbo Drop for the first time today... it was lets say, ""good"". That is to say - it didnt make me want to shoot myself, like so many others ive seen recently have done... another movie ive witnessed recently on home DVD was ""Kate & Leopold"" - again, very good, a wonderfully heart warming film with a hint of science fiction and a large dose of ""love"" - yes I know.. love .. blah.. but..its a real feel good story... so inevitably love would play a major role in the forming of this theatrical performance.

at any rate, I think Im done writing for now.. perhaps I'll write a little more tonight... if not ... TTFN :P"

<b>Well thats not good, Since im out of work and have been for going on 5 months now, I suppose I need to get some action, rather then inaction - I will say tho, action comes in many forms... is sleeping not an action of some type? rest? Relaxation? So its settled... Although I am dangerously lazy and most often find myself bored, I am still in action - so my mind, for the time being, is safe -</b>"

"event","Patience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold. For if you put on more clothes as the cold increases, it will have no power to hurt you. So in like manner you must grow in patience when you meet with great wrongs, and they will then be powerless to vex your mind.
-Leonardo da Vinci

"event","it has been how many months now since i last checked you, well hopefully you missed me coz i miss you indirectly, hehehe. thanks dan for reminding me this livejournal, i can to write what i have in mind again. but then again do i have or does my mind have something to write? hmmm! so where should i start; is it with my career, my lovelife, my thoughts about life, or my life in general..... too many things! or in short i can't say any.... : ) what i can say for now is life is but temporary... you we should make the most out of it every passing second that we have..... life is but temporary, thus we should share this with our loved ones and for those we care coz each passing moment is very precious  and we just don't know when each one of us just passes by..... life is but temporary, so we should make and have a life that is truly happy and joyous... not by external content (materials things) but by internal contentment (spiritual, love, passion, compassion, etc.). life is a blessing and it's so beautiful but we have just one life and i know we and specifically I should handle it well... thanks! AMEN!"

"event","i just had my other class in ateneo yesterday evening. whew, that subject entails a lot of reading, so i can say work, work, work. i know it would be a great training and experience but what i worry is, can i pass it. well, hopefully i will. i really just have to do a lot of reading. i haven't done reading of any kind of book since i started working. one problem that i also have is i somewhat have a hard time expressing myself infront of articulate people, i guess i get intimidated with them. i tend to blush and my voice gets cranky. when can i ever outgrow this inferiority complex of mine. 

can anyone help me outgrow this....."

"event","love is so exciting and at the same time very puzzling. It is so hard to explain and yet you feel it. When it is in your grasp you tend not to lose it, you tend to hold and savor every minute and second of it. Sad thing is if you really don't take care of it, it will simply just slip and pass you by. Love is a very wonderful feeling and it is even wonderful when i share it with someone i truly love."

"event","hi.....
its been a while since i logged here.... what can i say i'm so busy lately that i don't have any time for myself sometimes... all work, all work.
i think this is not healthy or a good type of living. yeah right, i get paid but then i'm deprived of other things that makes life exciting...
on the contrary, come to think of it.... i'm still blessed and fortunate to have a work and a company that gives me salary to sustain my existence (daily expenses) here on earth. thank you LORD, i love you.
may we be thankful always of everything.... and that we should always remember that there is this almighty ONE who is always with us. :-)"

"event","my very special friend called me last night and upon knowing that she is the one made me feel very happy and excited at the same time. she called twice prior to our conversation. i feel so loved, hopefully it won't end because i too love her but honestly speaking i like to be wed with her but i'm not yet ready, does it sound contradictory? anyway, i'm taking it one step at a time.... who knows what the future may bring about.... but i still believe that we have a great effect on what we are and what we'll have in the future, it's not fate alone that works on our future but our own actions and doings. this is one thing that we don't agree on, she strongly believes in fate, but the good thing is that we don't argue about it. 

go forth and counquer the world . . . . . (-,-)"

This site is an instant directory to almost any person in the US and a good deal of their personal information.

So not only is this person/these people giving out vital information, but they obviously have far too much time on their hands."

I viewed it first in Japanese with subtitles (the only way. The directors in Japan know EXACTLY who's voice fits who, so they get it right the first time.) and then in English, respectively. Now I have looked up some of the english seyuues, or voice over artists. I must say, it is an all-star cast. The main character is Anne Hathaway, which most of you may recognize as Ella from Ella Enchanted, or Mia from The Princess Diaries (1 and 2). The supporting actor is Cary Elwes, which some of you may recognize as Robin Hood, from Robin Hood: Men in Tights, or Westley, from The Princess Bride. YUP. I was soooooo happy! Cary Elwes playing a smoothe, devonair cat (statue) who wears a tux complete with top hat and cane!! *drooooooooooool* It was smexy.

"event","In the beginning, something in me just wasn't clicking. I usually adore Nick Hornby, but this book just... I dunno. Maybe it was because he was doing a rather poor job of projecting that, indeed, his protagonist was female. This is something I would not reccommend of him. He is a wonderful writer of the male mind and male view; his interpretation of the female view is partially inaccurate, and partially idiotic. I can understand a good deal of it, sure. He does a fair enough job. But when a woman calls her husband to remind him to write a not for their daughter's dentist appointment and the husband rants about how she never calls just to call, things seem skewed.

Further on in the book, however, things become more soulful and in-depth. Things become more realistic, although it is completely fanciful. A DJ comes to live with them who is a spiritual healer who, supposedly, attained mystical healing powers from ingesting too much Extacy in his clubs. Compete fantasy, but the understanding of life and the world that comes from it is not. That understanding has brought out some great lines, and in turn, I have begun to highlight. Any author who's book recieves my flourescant glow on their page has something to reckon for. That is a seal of approval in my book (no pun intended).

Although I am only halfway-ish done, it seems that How to be Good might live up to the last word in it's title."

So many things, places, people, faces, to think about. Where does one possibly begin? In this melancholy world, who can honestly say that their minds do not wander to sad places and sad faces and situations and dreams that make them break inside. When listening to sad music, one begins to imagine what life might be like... differently. If that one person did something terrible; if that one friend betrayed you; if that one pet died; etc, etc, life goes on. What would it be like if all you knew was sadness? No happy sparks. No happy anything. A dull, uneventfull slough of mild depression.

This song reminds me of that life. The life I do not have. The life I think about, occaisionally. When I hear songs like this. The reminder that life can change. The reminder that tears fall, that things dissappear, that hearts can break.

I have a life so filled with happy sparks that I could power three continents for a hundred years. Tears fall, but they can fall with happiness. Things dissappear, but can be found again. Hearts break so that they can mend.

You have a two-sided<br>personality - On one hand, you revel in your<br>freedom and often prefer to live in your own<br>private dreams and on the other hand, humanity<br>intrigues you and you love watching on.<p>You<br>are actually very kind at heart and, hating to<br>see people hurt, you despise injustice. You<br>probably have one or two special friends, who<br>mean the world to you.<p>Also; you are probably<br>quite political, wanting to see justice done in<br>the world.<p>You are quite the dreamer, needing<br>your freedom and personal space to dream your<br>little dreams. You love to escape into a book<br>or some good music and just drift away.<p>Some<br>of your good points are that you are sensitive,<br>compassionate and a freethinker. Your bad<br>points are that you may come across as cool and<br>aloof to others and probably have a tendency to<br>depression.<p>You are the ultimate dreamer with<br>a kind - yet troubled heart.

"event","There's a quote from Slaughterhouse-Five that I absolutely love. These three soldiers are trying to find a kitchen in a communal refugee-ish area, and they accidentally stumble into the girls' shower. They open the door to find thirty teenage girls showering completely bare together. The line was:

""They covered themselves with their hands and turned their backs and so on, and made themselves utterly beautiful.""

I thought that was a great line, because it personifies how beautiful innocence is. These girls have been thorugh bombings and horrors and things people only dream about in nightmares and they still shriek and scramble like schoolgirls do when a boy accidentally stumbles into the girls' locker room instead of the boys' because he lost his glasses and couldn't read the sign. I dunno, I just like the symbol of beauty in innosence.

"event","Interesting story in the news lately. A woman was going to get married to this guy, then one morning about 12 days ago she dissappeared. Of course the police came down hard on the man and the girl's family. The husband-to-be had to take a lie test and all this jazz. They found her the other day. She had gotten cold feet and run away without telling anyone, thinking that they wouldn't go looking for her or something.

Can you spell 'idiot'?

I can understand getting cold feet, but after the whole 'Laci Peterson' deal, you DON'T RUN AWAY!!! God, that poor man... think about how he must've felt: The love of his life dissappears, he gets the evil eye from everyone about being a possible murderer, has to take a lie test, has to answer all these questions, then they find the wife-to-be and she says that she was scared. WELL THANKS! That's reassuring, honey! I'm glad that you were so afraid that you ran away without telling any of us possibly to start a new life for yourself while you left me here to ROT and possibly get time in JAIL for the chance that I may have MURDERED YOU. GOD WOMAN! Seriously, what in the blue hell goes through some people's minds."

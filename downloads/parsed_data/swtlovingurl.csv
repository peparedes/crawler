ah yes..i saw ""saw"" .. get it? hahaha yah im a dork   that movie was actually okay...i thought it was gonna be really, really bloody and disgusting...just plain gross..but it turns out it wasn't as gory as i thought it would be..phew! thank goodness..i did get grossed out in a few parts & scared in some parts too...note to self: do not sit next to shirin during a scary movie..she will elbow u when there are scary parts which makes u more scared..haha..i think she did it to me a couple of times, but one of the times was one of those scary scenes where u get jumpy..and i got freaked out and double time cuz she elbowed me right then!! aahHhh!!   hahaha...im a big chicken when it comes to scary movies, but i still like watching them..im weird..hehe..but yah the movie was alright..it made u think..and u really never kno what is happening and can't really predict the ending..so if u haven't watched it, think about watching it maybe!

so the count down till my gmats is getting a heck of a lot closer..gosh, im starting to get nervous..i haven't felt this way since the SAT's but this time it's worse cause it's business school and it's a lot harder getting in than undergrad..wish me luck!!  14 days till doom..haha jk :P

good ol halloween...haha..gives girls an excuse to dress hecka skanky & not get crap for dressing that way..laungerie and what not...last nite i went clubbing in downtown sd. some people have some very creative minds w/ the costumes they came up with...clever, clever..while we were waiting in line to get in the club we saw a guy that was dressed up as that one machine monster thingie from spider man 2...holy crap, that was crazy..he had to wake in the street and make sure he wasn't hitting people, hahaha   i wanted to take a picture with him, but he was too popular, so didn't get a chance...saw a lot of ppl dressed up as lil kim..caucasian lil kims...hhmmm    haha...haha there was this one guy who had a really funny costume but u had to be there to get the full visualization..we didn't get into the club till sorta late, but at least we got it in!  oh which brings me to the getting in actually..we get to the bouncer and he freaking looks at my ID for a good 2-3 minutes..acK!  he kept looking at the back, the front, sideways, what not..and then made me tell him the info on my driver's license, and then he looked at my eyes and then told me to smile for him..dooooodd, i was just thinkin ""just lemme in, im freakin over 21 for goodness sake!!""  arrggh, that always happens to me anywhere u need to have an ID to do something..cuz dammit i don't look even 21..rrawwwrr...

the clubbing experience itself was interesting..hahaha..as always i always leave the club w/ a lot of interesting experiences and my friend's getting good laughs outta the stuff that happens to me...in a nutshell i was approached by a bunch of not so attractive guys, guys that wouldn't leave alone when i clearly didn't want to dance with them, guys that feel the need to pass by you and touch ur waist and then the ass..yes the ass  ... when they very well can just get by, by just simply not touching you or the shoulder...gosh!  o then there were the guys that like to bump and grind up against you like no other, grabbing u & touching u...whoo don't u jus love that?!?!  hahaha..o and then there are those that gotta take to u like ""hey baby, wanna dance?"" or ""hey ___ (fill in whatever ur costume was) let's dance."" and when u tell em ur w/ someone else, then they gotta respond w/ ""well now ur w/ me."" uuhh *gag* hahaha...oh and get this, there was a guy that was dancing w/ some girl and then grabbed my arm and smiled at me and i was thinking, ""uuuhhh helloo ur dancing w/ another girl and ur smilin & flirtin w/ me?!? wth?!""    there were several other stories from last nite, but those were some of em..there were lotta girls dressed up as nurses, but they were tryin to be sexy nurses but then there dress didnt even look sexy..eh..and then there were lots of girls w/ wings sorta costumes..i was a butterfly, yay!  i had my tank top, skirt w/ butterflies (and i remembered last nite why i don't wear a skirt to a club anymore)..and i actually wore make up..wow i kno, it's a shocker..haha..i like my wings, but they got in the way a lot..haha..the only good thing was that it sort of prevented guys from comin up from behind me, altho the wings got flattened out a thru the nite cuz it didn't prevent guys from coming up behind me as well as i had thought it would...and had guys just touchin my wings as a starter for conversation...ah yes and the fair share of people spilling their drinks on me...how nice..that is it a nutshell pretty much..i could go more in detail about each one, but i'd prefer not to here..hehehe..lovely ain't it?"

AHHhhhhhhhh..hehehehe..the movie was soooo packed toO!!  wow, i didn't think that many ppl would go see it since it had bad reviews. we had to sit in the front rows, ewww...i think that made it scary cause when something scary happened it was right in front of you, haha...i saw the japanese version a few months back and i think this was scarier cause in the jap version u're paying attention to the subtitles as well as what's going on, but this one you know english so you're paying attention to the movie completely...after the movie went to friday's...foOoooooooddd, yum yum!!    sunday...hhmmmm not doing anything today really...oke doke..ta ta!!!"

"event","i watched forgotten on thursday!!  i thought the movie would be really freaky or scary, but turns out it wasn't as scary as i thought it'd be..but nonetheless i did get scared a lil..hehe..more like jumpy, haha..but all in all i liked the movie..i guess it just depends on your own personal opinon.  

last night i went out to dinner w/ the group..fun times, as always..   we always have lots of laughs, hehe..hadn't really seen any of them for a few weeks now...sadness *sniff*  you know you haven't seen or really talked to your friends much when one of the questions asked at the beginning is ""so what have you been up to?""  we ate at on the border and ordered a pitcher of margarita..it was good, but not really my favorite drink.  afterwards we went back to brian's apartment and watched tv for a little bit..and then eileen came over and then we all played cranium..whoo hoo for cranium!! hehehe..well first we made an attempt to play outburst, but we didn't remember how to play and were confused cause the cards had the same answer multiple times on the card!!   so yah we played cranium...bri, mike, and myself were on a team the first round and we beat eileen, matt, and christie, muahahaha :P  jk!  and then bri, christie, and myself were on a team the second round and we beat the other team..whoo hhoooo...i guess brian and i are just that good at cranium..haha NOT!  that game always ends up in loads of laughter..silly stuff, silly people = fun times 

im so proud of myself..i've been working out everyday still...it's been 3 months now that i've been going everyday..i don't see any difference, but my parent's friends have said that i lost weight and so have some of my friends i haven't seen in a while..yay me!!

went to irvine saturday - initially for lan's housewarming party..which ended up getting cancelled..but it was still nice hanging out w/ some of the irvine people..didn't do much: ate dinner, shopped, hung out, chit chatted, saw lan's apt again..

since then i've..hung out w/ some friends & went shopping..studied, studied, oh and studied..umm worked out and more working out...what fun!!  umm and tomorrow i'm going to ucsd's mba program info session..im excited about that cause i get to learn more about their new program and decide whether or not to apply there for fall 2005.

"event","last week was sort of an emotional time for me & my family..well my mom more so..last tuesday early morning we got a call informing us that my uncle had passed away...i was in shock, although i know i probably shouldn't have been since we knew had cancer for the past 8-10 months. i'm really glad my mom was able to go see him if not all of us. it was ironic because my mom got back on monday afternoon and he passed away early morning Tuesday. It's like he wanted to see my mom one last time before leaving us. the dr. told my mom that he had never seen anyone with the will power to live, as he had seen in my uncle. i'm going to miss my uncle a lot and a lot of tears were shed that morning.  but he's probably in a better place now & it's probably for the best rather than him suffering and being in misery.  

i haven't really been doing all that much lately...same old, same old..you know..i'm still debating whether or not to apply to ucsd's mba program for fall 2005..it'll be the first class there..we'll see..i have a little bit of time..i already filled out the app i just have to get everything together. oh yeah, i'm registering to take calculus  for january..but just at a community college..i was looking into the pre-reqs for business schools & some of them need a year of calc which i don't have..so i'm going to take that in january. i don't really want to spend money on taking it through ucsd extension, so i'm going to be cheap and take it at miramar or something. wish me luck cuz i suck at calc! haha..i can do stats but not calc...

o yes..i went to downtown sd last friday night with a bunch of friends..went to this place ol madrid or something..it was pretty cool..it was a fun night cuz funny things happened..like i said without fail something interesting always manages to happen to me..but luckily i was not the only one it happened to this time, muahahaha!!   had 2 drinks..that was good enough for me seeing how freaking expensive drinks are at clubs...and get this, they didnt have 151 to make a drink i wanted...what kind of bar is that!?! haha    it was funny cuz one of my friends got really buzzed or slightly drunk, one or the other off 2 drinks...and she was saying how it wasn't fair that i wasn't even buzzed..lol..i felt the alki and my cheeks were red (yes i get red & i have pics to prove it many times)..but i wasn't super buzzed or anything..and the feeling of the alki went away in like 10 mins...haha..lame  

oke 2 more things before i get back to work:

> anyone interested in walking in the Breast Cancer Walk in San Diego?!?!    come on!!! it's for a good cause and you're getting a greeaaatt work out!!!  can't get better than that!! hehe..let me know if you are interested..so far i have 4 people including me, good job!! 

>> soooo nobody has fessed up for writing the ""your bf's mom"" message...i think i might have to start some detective work soon..dum dum dum!!    cooommmeeee ooooonnnn...whoever did it just tell me!! IM me and tell me or something! haha...it's driving me nuts, lol!! (ok mebbe not nuts, but i'm very curious and curiousity is getting to me, haha!)"

So about 10 months ago we got news that my uncle in India was dianosed with cancer.. my mom went to go see her brother a week or so after she found out, seeing that the doctor's had told her it could be a matter of months before he passes away. Last week, 10 months later, we get news that it could be a matter of days before he passes away.  So, today my mom left for India to go visit him, which could be very likely the last time she sees him..my mom is this uncle's favorite out of all her siblings and she has 5..and he is my favorite uncle as well as i am his favorite niece...i'm really miss him!!!  It sucks because I haven't seen him in 5 years, because I haven't been back there since after I graduated college..the time my parents did go, I had an internship during the summer which I couldn't take time away from to go..boy do I regret that now..I wanted to go with my mom, but we just don't have enough money for the both of us to go.  I guess I will have to be content with being there in spirit. Not being able to do anything is the hard part..know that I all I can do is sit back and do nothing...is well, hard..As for my uncle, I guess he'll be going to a better place..that's all I can really tell myself to make myself feel a little better..Cancer...I really wish there was a cure for all types of it..so many people die from the different types of cancers out there..sad, sad, sad... 

Just typing this brings back memories of my uncle and brings tears to my eyes *sniff*"

mmmm let's see..my take on friendship: 

> it's a 2 way thing: don't expect me to make all the effort, after all it's a type of relationship..and a relationship requires two people making the effort.

> don't expect to throw away the friendship with me for lame reasons and then come back for it anytime you want..that isn't happening!!!   oh and on top of that pretending that you didn't do anything and nothing happened (oohhh i really can't stand that!)

> if you threw it away once it makes me wonder how much you really cared about the friendship in the first place

> i strongly dislike people who throw away friendships!!!  good, genuine friends are hard to come by...we should all know that by now!! and just throwing it away...ugghhh..it irks me!! 

k enuff ranting from me..phew..i know it's a load full..hahhaha...i was talking to someone about this earlier today, so i thought i'd make a post of it..la la la!"

"event","HAPPY BIRTHDAY BRIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! whooo hoooo we're all old foggies now! hahaha :P 

it was a rather hectic day...had work of course, but i got off early cuz we were throwing bri a surprise bday party!! :)  exciting huh!? i was excited, haha..cuz i'd never thrown anyone a surprise birthday party. so it was a new thing for me, yay! :P  i think it went pretty well..since he was surprised & didn't suspect anything. me, mike & matt got to the apt early and decorated, got food, and then it was almost party time! we ate food from pat & oscar's (yummy!) and just watched tv & talked..then had some ice-cream cake, it was really good, mMmmm..o yah and bri opened presents before that too..he got a dvd player (from christie) & season 1 & 2 of friend's (from me, mike & matt). brian said how it was odd cuz doing that was so not like us..which is partially cuz we never really organize anything beforehand, it's almost always just the day of thing we decide to do...but this was a special occassion, hehe..and also cuz he said we never do anything for any of our birthday's usually, but i think that's cuz we've never really been all together for any of our birthday's..cept this year for mine which we didn't celebrate till the day after cuz it was father's day & i wasn't here, haha..but yah, last nite was fun :)

and weekend here i come!! whhheeee :P"

"event","WHoa..it's August already!! time sure flies by huh?  So i started my new job last monday..it's good: good pay, nice people, i like what i'm doing..it's good.  everything just is more hectic since i work till 5:30/6, n then come home around 6:30/7 from sitting in traffic..eat dinner, wait a lil and go work out..working out makes me even more tired than i am already, so i basically come home do some stuff for a lil while and hit the sack! WHAT AN EXCITING LIFE!!! haha not!..being an adult can sometimes suck..but it does have its upsides :P  

aside from work and working out last week..i hung out with ppl & that was fun! 

thurs - worked till a lil late that nite & then went to dinner at islands w/ bri, matt, and eileen..then went back to our usual hang out place (aka bri's apt..hehe) and played munchkin..haha, a very interesting and fun game..n then watched some korean movie, it was umm..violent n sorta weird..i wasn't really paying attn so i think i'll need to rewatch that sometime again..

fri - worked of course..got out a lil early & went to the del mar race track..that was fun & a new adventure..i'd never been to the race track to watch horse racing..i didn't bet ne money cuz i just wanted to watch & kinda get the hang of it..so i think i got how to bet down..i did ""pretend"" betting..hahaha..ghetto, yes i kno..but hey who cares?  after the races were over..i stayed to watch switchfoot (!!!!!!!!) play!!..it was FREE too, whoo hoo!!..well free w/ a paid admission to the races (which was only 5 bucks, that was very well worth it!)..i thought they were only gonna play 1 or 2 songs, but turns out they played 9 or 10 songs, so pretty much like an entire concert..they were awesome, i think they sounded better live than on the radio n such..the only bad thing about the concert was that stupid ppl thought they'd be kewl by throwing crap at ppl..*rawr* that wasn't very nice cuz ppl were getting hit by plastic bottles, race programs, money!! ugghh..some ppl should really grow up!..but other than that it was a good concert, i had fun! it was kinda early still, 9:30ish, so i ended up going to friday's for happy hour, yummmyy..sorta a long wait, but gooood food..i actually didnt eat appetizers this time, i think im sick of eating them since i've eaten them so much..haha..

sat - went to a picnic in mission beach..oOOo good fooood!!..they had carne asada to make ur own tacos, korean bbq, chicken, tons of desserts..pretty much a crapload of goood food..haha..later on went to dinner in hillcrest w/ matt & kristine..we ate at taste of thai (it was voted san diego's best thai food so we tried it out)..it was SOOO GOOD!!..and it was a good price for the amnt of food u got..so i recommed that to anyone who likes thai food. afterwards we went back to mira mesa to watch harold & kumar go to whitecastle...linda & jay joined us as well...haha that movie was so funny, stupid funny..but funny nonetheless..

sun - hung out with a friend i hadn't seen in a while..we went to hillcrest, and got some late lunch at corvette diner..very interesting i'd hafta say..they threw straws at us first off..n then at the end they threw gum at us..hahaha..it's their style..afterwards we walked around a good amnt, hehe..too bad i was wearing flip flops which made it a lot harder to walk that much..gRrr..ended up at a coffee shop, relaxed a lil and went back home..(thanx for visiting!!!)...got home, and a lil later headed to bri's apt w/ matt to eat some korean bbq!!! yummy in tummy yo! .. played some munchkin again..that game is interesting..oOo ooO i won again tonite!! cept for when we played a new type of munchkin game, bri one..but hopefully the pattern will contine: bri wins the first time we play a munchkin game (3 games)..n then from then on out i win..

..and that my friends is all i have time to write..goodnite"

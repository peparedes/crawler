"event","Lately I've found myself questioning quite a bit of my life.&nbsp; I'm not sure if its introspection, or regrets of my past.&nbsp; I often feel like I'm going nowhere; conversely, I have a good job that I'm good at, a loving husband, and many reasons to be content.&nbsp; And yet, somehow, I feel...empty.&nbsp; I've noticed lately my depressive swings are somewhat more intense, but are somewhat shorter than they once were.&nbsp; I've also noticed lately an almost overwhelming craving for a cigarette; I&nbsp;quit 4 years ago.&nbsp; Somehow, I always want to smoke when I'm depressed.&nbsp; I usually want coffee at the same time, which is odd, but I think it came from my freshman year at college.&nbsp; I would leave for class about 30 minutes early, get a cup of coffee, a bagel, and have a cigigie between the Union and Blair Hall.&nbsp; I want a smoke when I have certain kinds of coffee, but I don't want coffee every time I&nbsp;have a cigarette. &nbsp;

I joined the Facebook-side of the force this week.&nbsp; I am finding people I remember from high school and college, yet I&nbsp;can't think of much to say to them.&nbsp; It's still nice to be connect though.

I think I&quot;m thinking too much and worrying too much.&nbsp; I'm going to go get some sleep (I hope) and dream of necromancers learning intriguing new methods of torture.&nbsp; Gee, I can't imagine why I'm such a bitch in the mornings...."

I need to work on my writing some more, but the time it takes coupled with the sheer amount of time I spend in front of a computer at work make me very sad and unwilling to do what I need to.&nbsp; I&nbsp;actually find myself avoiding my compute of late, if only because of how much time I spend shackled to the damn thing all week at work.
Which reminds me, I hate being known as capable and dependable.&nbsp; It ends with me doing a lot more work.


But despite all that, I'm fairly content.&nbsp; Jake (cousin-in-law) and Mark are trading cards in the other room, I just finished a cinnamon roll, and I&nbsp;get to spend tomorrow with my mommy-person.&nbsp; And The Dragon Reborn is actually moving at a good pace, so my book reading is going pretty well.&nbsp; Can't complain too loudly, really."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Borrowed from Tom Smith..."">Reprinted in its entirety from the e-mail:<br /><br />Dear Tom --<br /><br />On Tuesday at 8 a.m., I will stand trial for speaking three truthful words: &quot;I am gay.&quot;<br /><br />On Tuesday, I will face a panel of colonels who will decide whether or not to fire me -- to discharge me for &quot;moral and professional dereliction&quot; under the military's &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; policy.<br /><br />On Tuesday, I will try to prove that it's not immoral to tell the truth.<br /><br />As an infantry officer, an Iraq combat veteran and a West Point graduate with a degree in Arabic, I refuse to lie to my commanders. I refuse to lie to my peers. I refuse to lie to my subordinates.<br /><br />My case requires that I provide personal testimony from people who can attest to my character. That's why several members of my military unit have written letters of support and offered to testify on my behalf.<br /><br />Now I need your help. ANYONE who believes the Army should not fire me can take a stand right now. I am bringing a statement of support to Tuesday's trial and I need you to add your signature to it. Will you support me by signing this statement before Tuesday?<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.couragecampaign.org/SupportDan"" class=""snap_shots"">http://www.couragecampaign.org/SupportD<wbr></wbr>an</a><br /><br />I want to thank the 141,262 people who have signed the &quot;Don't Fire Dan&quot; letter launched a few weeks ago by the Courage Campaign and CREDO Mobile to President Obama, asking him to take leadership to bring this tragic policy to an end.<br /><br />The momentum is building. This week, 77 members of Congress signed a letter to the President citing my service as an example of why DADT should be repealed. And a Gallup poll was recently released showing that 69 percent of Americans -- including 58 percent of Republicans - favor allowing openly gay men and lesbian women to serve their country .<br /><br />As I learned at West Point, deception and lies poison a unit and cripple a fighting force. That's why more than 70 of my fellow West Point graduates have also come out of the closet to join Knights Out, the organization I co-founded to build support for the repeal of &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot;.<br /><br />The only way we will eventually overturn &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; is by speaking up together. You can help me fight back right now by adding your name to my statement of support. On Tuesday morning, I will bring your signature -- and thousands of others -- to my trial as a demonstration of your collective support:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.couragecampaign.org/SupportDan"" class=""snap_shots"">http://www.couragecampaign.org/SupportD<wbr></wbr>an</a><br /><br />National security means many things, but the thing that makes us secure in our nation and homes is love. What makes me a better soldier, leader, Christian and human being is love. And I'm not going to hide my love.<br /><br />Love is worth it.<br /><br />Thank you for your support.<br /><br />Daniel W. Choi<br />1LT, IN<br />New York Army National Guard<br /><br /><i>Courage Campaign Issues is part of the Courage Campaign's online organizing network that empowers more than 700,000 grassroots and netroots supporters to push for progressive change and full equality in California.</i></lj-cut>"

And now, the saga of Tim continues.&nbsp; It would seem that Dippy Doo was indeed drunk (.177 BAC), was at least in a helmet, but was wearing shorts and flipflops.&nbsp; His wallet literally saved his ass; without it, he'd probably be sittin' lopsided.&nbsp; His excuse for the accident?&nbsp; He blames his girl-friend-person-whatever for texting him and he was trying to answer it!&nbsp; I doubt it's the truth, but who can say?
Oh yes, and the reason he had the BMW?&nbsp; He completely wore 3 tires down to the cords in the last 3 months (mostly from burn-outs and other idiot manuevers); his bike was jacked up and lacked a rear tire; and he HAD to be at work.&nbsp; So, Dad loaned him the Beemer.&nbsp; The catch?&nbsp; Tim hasn't had a job for a MONTH.&nbsp; He lied, outright.&nbsp; If he'd told the truth, he would have been allowed to sleep at Dad's or they'd have gotten him a ride home.&nbsp; But he lied instead.

Part of me wishes that I could upload pictures of the bike (which are on my phone).&nbsp; I'd show you before and after, but it just...yikes.&nbsp;&nbsp; It cost my dad $750 to get back the ruins of his now useless and ruined bike.&nbsp; And that was just to cover towing and $500 on the DUI charge Tim now has.

And Tim shows no real remorse, no real regret.&nbsp; He said some very nasty things last night, and said more today, and then has the nerve to be irked at the apparent lack of sympathy from his parents.
As of this post, he has also been removed from the wedding party.



As a happier note, I need current addresses from everyone - we start invitation addressing next week!"

A big plus, we have a new card shop in Pekin.&nbsp; They're really nice and affordable, so I've been going to Friday Night Magic and am in the process of building a few new decks.&nbsp; It's funny - I still think of myself as a noob, but the noobs are asking me what to do with their decks!&nbsp; I guess Mark's ramblings are getting through to some part of my brain...

Basically, my wishes on this wedding have been ignored.&nbsp; The wedding itself is the cause of my anxiety (and bad dreams which leads to lack of sleep...), and I have no real fears about actually being (or getting) married, under the right circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, my dad has spent&nbsp; an awful lot of money on the wedding, so I don't want to up and elope&nbsp; and basically waste all of their money, time, and effort, not to mention hurt feelings.

Mostly, I get sick of staring at a computer all day.  

I don't have any news really.  Just the repeating message that I don't really want to go through with this wedding.  Don't get me wrong, I want to marry Mark.  I just don't want the wedding.  I don't care about the flowers or the dresses or the jewelry (excepting my hatred of pearls) or the food or anything else.  I just want a small quiet affair and to be married.  I don't want the wedding is all.

We survived the ice; hope you all did as well.  I've got errands to run and so my mind is not in posting mode.  gotta run!"

Julie, were you wanting pics as well?"

Very little to report, actually.  We got a new king size bed and life is awesome.  Wedding plans are rolling smoothly, and I do have pics of my dress coming soon to certain people who ask nicely.  But not for Mark (sorry babe), or to anyone who thinks they're going to send them to him either.  I only get one shot at complete surprise and my dress is it!  
Oh yeah, that jogged my memory:  If you want an invite, zip me a line!  I'm pretty sure I know who all on the list can make it and would be interested, but sometimes I'm not too sure either.  

Yep, got no real news.  I think I'll go finish my turkey and then finish painting the living room.  Ta!"

"event","Woah, its been a week?  I'm slipping in my old age.  Or something.  I think I'll go with something.
There really isn't much news to report.  Work is ... interesting?  There's a major shake up going on and, once again, as the promotions and advancements happen, I get left in the corner.  Why?  It's not that I'm not good enough; its because I do my job very well, and that we don't have another teller to fill that spot.  ""Eventually"" I get to move up front and do full-time marketing and receptionist duties.  ""Eventually.""  Unless one of the gals at our other branch comes back, and if the other manager is still thinking about leaving.  Then I might get the branch manager position.  But that's almost in Bloomington.  Which ain't cool.

Wedding stuff is proceeding smoothly - I'm okay with Karen doing it all.  I don't have to sweat most of it!  Mom seems to be happy as long as I'm happy; I really don't want it becoming a sore spot..."

I DID buy a new car on the 18th.  A 2007 Kia Rio, silver.  No name yet, but she'll get one!  Outside of that, I did find some good tux options and a very nice bridesmaid dress and invitations yesterday.  I'm worried my 'rents are spending too much on this shindig but everytime I protest, they keep saying ""We only get to do this once!""  I'm trying to keep that in perspective, but its hard sometimes."

I promised Mark I would'nt talk about wedding stuff for a month, but I can write it!
I'm a wee bitty bit excited.  And now, I must do laundry!"

"event","Mark and I set the date for the wedding:  October 11, 2008.  As of now, I have no details.  My Dad and Stepmonster are pushing and pushing for places <i>they</i> like, regardless of what we really want.
I have shopped for a dress, and even tried two on.  (I felt like a cow wrapped in silk and lace.)  I just have a hard time justifying that kind of money for something I will wear ONE TIME, and then put in storage.  I know, I konw, its your wedding gown, you only do this once, etc., but what we want is being overridden before we can even say what it is we want.
I am grateful that my mom and Mark's parents agree that it is OUR wedding and that we should do it our way.  Now if I could get the other two to listen...


Enough wedding rant!  There will be plenty of time for that later.  How's everyone else's life running?  Crazy?  Smooth?  Who has big announcements or randomness to soothe my brain?"

"event","Well, at least they didn't harp on the wedding tonight.  And I told them we weren't talking about it.  That slowed them down.  Instead my dad thought it fit to remind me my car is dying and that I need a new one.  Then he started talking about houses, and good little towns to live in.  Like Emden.  Always with that little spiel...
And then we have to start on the kids thing again.  Sweet angry Jesus I'm already sick of the ""kids are so great"" thing.  I DO NOT WANT CHILDREN.  I know I will still end up birthing 2 of them; I don't really want them.  After I've got the damn things I may change my mind about those particular ones, but I'm not real fond of the idea.
It's like those little visits are designed to make me feel like shit.  I must be a masochist; I keep going."

So, other than still going ""Yay, I'm engaged!"" there's not much going on.  I'm on vacation this week, and will be painting my living room.  I think.  I may say f-u-g-i-t and just relax instead.  What do you think?"

"event","Superman Returns: was okay, continued the story pretty well, I saw it in 3D, alot more worth it in 3D.

Click: loved the movie, nothing like the trailers, a little bit sad but all in all its a pretty good movie.

Lake House: gawd that was confusing, sappy chick flick, all comes together in the end, okay story.

Tokyo Drift: Filled with action, as much as I didnt wanna see chinks drive.. i liked it, nice cars and sorta like the story, thought it was too short.

Cars: kid's movie, not much of a story.. i was quiet disapointed, you'd be much better off seeing Over the Hedge.

Next few movies are: Pirates of the Caribbean2, Devil wears Prada, You-me-and Dupree. If any of you wanna come tell me on msn :D It'll be fun.

So I've been working at the Keg lately, almost all men in the back.. kinda strange when you are surrounded by a dozen men. Wedding coming up on the 29th and I still havent bought a dress. Going to see Underwater 3D or 3D Wild Safari sometime soon. Oh and I officialy admit I have a problem, an Ice Cream addiction, I cant go a day without eating some. Camping in Osoyoos was awesome, going up to Christina Lake on the 17th of August for about a week, going to be fun :D Oh and Benny Benassi is here this friday, going to that unless the Plush will be gay and catch my fake id. Its going to soo amazing."

"event","Final week of school.. and you guessed it, I'm still studying like hell. I was planning on getting all this done before Tuesday, work and all.. didnt happen, and now if I dont do great on this final I'm screwed... like, completely, with no one to blame but myself. I even took the day off work, which I'm sure pissed off at least three people, sitting here looking at the physics and realizing I dont know much.. *sigh*
I'm not a blonde anymore though, 110 bux later I'm a brunette. Not fond of it. But I wanted a dramatic change because my hair has always been one and the same.. and any streaks I ever tried to do faded in no time.. so now, its different. 110 bux on july 27th will make it lighter, hopefully... its just waaaay too different.
The Keg called me back, they want me as a cook there. Very exciting for me. A lot more money to be made with a lot less to do. BUT I will miss *almost* everyone at ABC. Everyone but Deb. I cant believe what she's said about me. Even as much as I hate Padley&nbsp;I still thought of him as a human being, but this woman, I just dont think she deserves... ah nevermind. I never thought an old lady could be, oh I cant even find a worhty word for her.
Going to Osoyoos on the 30th.. well leaving eve of the 29th. Going to be there until evening of the 3rd and then coming back. Its going to be another awesome vacation, its just too bad that Tim isnt coming down anymore.
Anyways yeah.. main things :P"

"event","As you all know it was my bday on the 20th. It went great, I wish I got more prezies tho *feels deprived*. I went shopping in the morning (and on the monday after) for prezies [Metrotown and Bellis Fair]. The entire evening was spent with Timmy doing want I wanted to go (Keg, Go Carting, Arcade.. It was too late to book the horseback riding). Anyways I enjoyed it. <br /><font size=""1"">So, Kevin (guy at work) always talks about how good he is at Halo and how good all the people are who he plays with.. Now I know quiet a few of YOU GUYS love</font> <font color=""#993300"" size=""4"">HALO <font size=""1"">so, I think you should all play against each other sometime.. A beloved Halo night?<br />..On a different topic. I knew that when Timmy would recieve the answer from RMC there would be a major happy part to it and a major dissapointment, whichever way the answer would go. They rejected him, cause of his eyesight. Means he's staying around longer but, also that his dream that he worked so hard for is shattered.. *sigh* I hate things like this, no matter what the result, theres always a down part.<br />Oh and I got my ID so if anyone wants to go to a bar or club or anything.. I will if Im free :P</font></font>"

"event","Still happy, very happy. Although, all fridays Tim picks me up from work to watch some movies with him and then he drives me to work in the morning... yesterday, I havent heard from him after four. I called him this morning (right before he starts work at nine), no answer. I'm worried, I hope he's okay.. I truly do.
So, Timmy is so close to getting an answer from the Royal Military College. If he recieves a letter this month,.. they've rejected him, if a phone call - they accepted him. So the wait continues. I'm so totaly torn on this subject I dont know what to think anymore.
There are two raves I'm attending in the next week or so (going to try to anyways). DARUDE - at Club XOX ..and DJ SHARAZ the previous day. Its two DJs I've always wanted to see, these wont be drugged up raves.. this will be a pure apreciation of these two very great DJs. It will only cost me 45 bux to buy ticket for both and I think thats helluva deal!
My BDAY IS SO FREAKING SOON. I took it off work and I'm going shoppin in USA in the morning. Then, I dont know.. but it'll be fun. And although I never want anything, I hope I get lotz of prezies.. cause I do love surprizes. MAY 20TH!!! WEEHEE..
...oh and aparently, this Sunday morning that I'll be working. It'll be hella busy. I hope not :P"

"event","So I'm in a wonderful mood today. YOU BETTER NOT RUIN IT OR I WILL HURT YOU. Midnight, Tim stopped by to drop off his graphing calc. 'cause I needed it for today but when I went to school I forgot it *oops*. He always makes me light up when I see him :). But, somehow my alarm clock didnt wake me up *was confused as I got up on my own an hour late*.. but still made it to B block happier 'cause of the extra sleep. Aced that math test, although felt kinda pressed for time near the end. We had a looong, but fun, discussion about materialism in Socials and then mom picked me up so we could go to ICBC for my knowledge test. I PASSED IT! 40 out of 41 (guess they shorten it if you keep getting em pretty much all right). Anyways, long overdue and fairly needed.. at least my dad will let me drive now grr. Then stopped by the hair salon to get some stuff 'cause I've ran out.. I definatly think I spend too much on things concerning my looks, but meh. Work called, dont know why.. wasnt there to answer the phone but I ""hope"" Kevin IS going to work tonight. Its sort of fine if you're sick one day, but not two.. especially not Thursday AND Friday.
Anyways I'm all happy and stuff, :D End of the week, happy end, and after work there will be the joyus weekend with friends and Timmy. :D:D:D"

"event","On Monday I had to spend the whole day at home with my parents because Tim was workin 'till almost six. Yeah, going to try to NEVER do that again.. just reminds me why I wanna move the hell out of here.. ugh. Then went to see him line one of the provincial games, sorta fun.. cept for the being there an hour before the game thing. One of the players got badly hurt and was twitching on the ice until the ambulance guys carried him off.
People seem to find this strange. I like ice cream. I like it enough that I will eat not only at 3pm, but at 3am, at midnight, for breakfast, as a before school snack, as a chaser for alcohol, when its freezing outside, when im sitting in an ice rink and ofcourse any other possible time. lol.
Oh, back to the unbearable living conditions. I cherish the weekends with Tim.. not only 'cause he's the greatest, but because coming back home seems like punishment.
Timmy's been tring to get in the RMC(Royal Military College) for two years now. Hasnt yet. I asked him what would happen if he got in this year, where he would study first. He said in a totaly.. careless manner.. that he'd be sent away at beginning of July to somewhere else in Canada for four years. The happy atmosphere that constantly fills my head suddenly disappered, but I dismissed the horrible thought with a ""well, I sure hope you wont get in this year then."" Didn't really think of it much after than 'till I lay down in my bed and suddenly the thoughts struck my happy atmosphere again. The thought of him leaving me and out of nowhere I started crying. I realized this and thought to myself, wtf! But that is how strongly I feel, I guess consiously I didnt quiet realize it. He just means too much to me now. As high as I thought my standards were for men before I met him, now that I know how great a man can be.. lets just say he better stay with me or I'll be one lonely girl trying to match now 'OMG so much higher' standards. It's a dream, from which I hope I never wake up to be an emo girl LOL.
The other day I decided to bleach my hair, started doing it, got too chicken and washed the MaxiBlonde out in 15 mins >.> its pale yellow, I dont like it. I wanna dye it light, greyish brown and put blonde streaks in.. But its going to cost me... err I'll leave it for a bit, let my hair rest. I did go and chop off all the dead ends which is nice.. but I dont really like the haircut the guy gave me either...
Oh and I've been clean for... man, too long now.. NOTHING in my system. Wonderful. But, I dont really see myself being much healthier. You think that some good would come out of this. lol.
..and I got a new CELLPHONE! Thats right :D Samsung a920, its a purty mp3 flip phone, SO MANY features.. and was totaly free for 30bux a month with so much free stuff.. too lazy to write it all out 'cause I'm sleepy - good night."

"event","You know I'm never the one for celebrating this.. and now when I really could, I cant. I'm busy from 6am to 10pm with a half an hour break (3:30-4) which I will spend getting from school, to work. Maybe I'll ask my physics teacher to let me out a bit earlier so I can have a snack and have dad drive to work. Definatly too busy for me, but its fine, 'cause its a cooking shift, and its worth it.
I, for one, is endless greatful for my man. Funny, I actually go to bed every night thankin the higher power for bring him into my life. I never though men like that even existed. I guess with the guys I've dated all my hope for ever finding someone good was annihilated and as a surprize, there he is, and he loves me.
ps, got my things from eBay, the lotion is great and the DC Shoes I got with make good work shoes.. black n leather, nothing that great looking - but good for work. Nighty night."

"event","So, lived a week my man. Clearly not enough, but parents missed me. I dont know how the hell they'll cope when I move out. Oh well, they'll live. He's wonderful, and we're both busy enough that we dont annoy each other and agree with each other on so much that its that nice being together.
Work is ridiculous. Sure now I get line cook shifts but aparently now I'm doing a shitty job as a dishwasher. Eff that. I do a better job than I usualy did and thats not enough for em. If my life didnt depend on earning money so much at the moment I'd quit and find something else. I'll get over it.. just gotta not work mornings.
Otherwise, life is good.. Everything is happening as it should. I'm happy. Ebay is awesome.. and I want to go see Final Destionation3 this friday (where is it playing?).. Writing two provincials on Tuesday to finish off this semester. Yup. Happy, happy. Gnite."

Help? maybe im just crazy. that is what i get told like every day....

"event","So I torture myself through a sleepless night 'cause I'm so sick. I really should have stayed home. At about 8 I decide that theres no possible way I'm going to be able to go to work. Phone in, Ingrid answers, I tell her that I'm feeling way too sick to come to work.. her response 'so we wont have a dishwasher then, great, i'll tell brandon when he comes in'. I swear the woman hates me, I remember one time I asked her to try to clear off the dishes and not just throw them all down.. she spazzed on me how she shouldnt be clearing dishes when customers are waiting for her. Thats, EVERY time? Right.. w/e.
Anyways Tim drops me off at home on his way to the rink. I get into bed, tell my mom to get me a thermometer 'cause Timmy said I felt a little hot. Guess what? 39 degree celsius. I'm coughing my ass off. My nose is so plugged I can barely breathe and all the pressure, coughin n trying to clear my nose is giving me THE biggest headache. So I lay there almost twitching 'cause it all feels so uncomfortable and I cant sleep.. eventually take 10-15 min naps. Mom measures my temprerature once in a while, keeps feeding me pills and stuff.. it was horrid. At about one I cant stay in bed anymore just feels too weird, try to be downstairs a bit but its just too uncomfortable so I go back to bed. Timmy calls asking if I'll be able to go to the mall.. yeah not happening. But he did stop by after. The guy's wonderful. I dont know how the hell I got so lucky with this one :P
..thats my horrid day, I'm still sick.. but hoping to be better by tomorrow's family dinner. (heh, not mine.)"

"event","He kinda makes me feel like I'm in a TV show sometimes, no, not the unrealistic part.. the part where theres romance I guess, when a couple's in embrace and most people go 'oh, i wish it was like that, wish he was that sweet, cared that much'. He does some of the most meaningful things, out of nowhere. Its kind of strange, I actually see myself getting attached already. But I wont, theres no way I'm letting myself do that.. yet. It just all seems to be going a bit too perfect.
So, ..raves. Hope anyone who went, enjoyed last night's rave.. and hope the crazy ones will enjoy tonight's one too. I decided if I have money - I'm attending NYE rave for sure. Other than that, most of my money has been going to.. you guessed it, christmas presents. Anyone I get a chance to see - will get something from me.. I have already bought half of the ""big"" presents for people so I better see you at least before New Years.
January 13th.. or at least I think thats the date. Room at the Holiday Inn. Renting snowboard n stuff. Buying a ride pass. Bringin lots of extra cash. Going to have tons of fun that weekend :) (This is with Tim, Ryan, Amanda and possibly Kim n Brent).
Anyways.. thats all for now.."

Seriously, I dont know how I'm going to do it. I have the money. I kinda have the time, but when I'm actually in the mall.. I get lost. The only things I ever find are for myself. I need help!!!
Tim is sweet. Maybe I can commit? We'll see I guess.
Just a few minutes ago I figured out the best Christmas (extra) gift that I want to give everyone I know, or well.. at least most people. I gotta find the time for it though...

I hate getting sick *note to self: build up immune system*.
sorted things out with tim, after i bitched him out he calmed me down and just explained how our schedules are just so fucked up that this is the way its going to be for a while,.. but he still wants to be with me. oddball. my really gorgeous oddball :D who's going to teach me to be as good at hockey as him.
I'm going to 'officialy' start my christmas shopping today. My first year of having an actual job. I love it. I get to buy everyone decent presents :D which makes me really happy. I may even buy some for people I'm not quiet fond of, but hey.. it is Christmas right. I already picked out a few *perfect* presents for some people :D
so aparently I'm going to be missing THREE raves in december. Grr. Freeze, Winterbreakz, and the NYE rave. Gah.. oh well, I get to not waste a lot of money and keep my mom company 'cause dad still decided to go to Cuba for the holidays.
School's going okay, report cards have been mailed home. Still havent got mine.. I think I did pretty good this term. two A's n two B's i think.. but hey! I may be able to take rockschool next semester so before that I'll pay a few visits to ricky n brad so I can have some practice on the bass before classes start.
but yeah, im far too distracted so ciao people, hope you all are having a good life too."

now that im done with that... err, went to see Walking in Line tonight. Stupid me, thought it was that movie that had the Rock in it.. turns out, no, its a Johny Cash movie.. mostly about how divorces are wrong, how his dad hates him and about his drug problem. Great. In a way, I'd rather have seen that gangstur fifty cent movie.. Get Rich or Die Trying.. Actually, I dont know.. it sounds pretty awful to me. Anyways, a few people might find this movie good, go see it if you dont know the story behind Johny.

But Tim FUCKING PISSED ME OFF TODAY. I was so damn close to just walking away, and he'd stand there all confused wondering what the fuck could he possibly have done wrong. FUCK! Well tomorrow at noon when he's supposed to call, he's going to realize all the things he does wrong in life.

Other than that, the day went fine, although by the time we got to the bus stops - the buses werent runnin anymore. I booked tomorrow off work though,.. I'm extremly happy that Jared was my little archangel and took my shift for tomorrow. Forever greatful. Now I have a shitload of homework to finish off so after I have that nice little talk at noon, the rest of my day will be dedicated to.. hw."

"event","Well, not much is going on really. As usual work/school taking my precious 'having a life' time away from me. And when on the free days I actually plan something - it ends up not happening. Kinda getting way too used to this 'routine' now. Kev might be stopping by after work tomorrow to see my doggy, I seriously dont know whats with him and dogs.. :S My mommy bought me a present for her birthday (it was on the 6th of November and I got her precious gifts that she just adored), a month of tanning. So, by December,.. I should be tanned :P
Oh, and I've decided not to go to Freeze, I'd rather get people prezies for christmas.. plus I can always go to the next one, which I plan to do. And you should all come, for my sake.
I havent seen any movies lately. Every time I plan to go - something else comes up. Oh well, no biggie really..
I've noticed how with the lack of life, anyone I ever knew have become acquitances more than anything. Friends isnt really the term I'd use to describe, well.. almost any of you. I dont have time for, anything these days.. which is good in a way, 'cause I get to concentrate on the important stuff; like self improvement, schooling and work.
But guess what? Remember how I all of a sudden just became happy - I STILL AM! :P lol."

Yeah, boo school. I slept until 11, going to go in for the math test last block and then come back here sleep some more and do homework. I doubt I'll be going to work today unless I feel better, not really my choice - my mom doesnt even wanna let me outta the house. That means I cant give Aaryn her present and Brandon will be upset:( ...anyways gotta go get ready.. have a good day ya'll."

"event","WAS FUCKING AWESOME. cept for mom ruining the beginning of it by messing up the way I had to travel there. Got there around 11, got searched (god, i love the fact that I can wear a bra). Gave all my shit to the coatcheck and then danced 10 hours straight.. mostly with some guy. But 16 caps made it all about the music, the people didnt matter, the security didnt matter, it was me, and the trance. I've never danced so much, all out, before. It was amazing. I just loved it. Most likely will attend any massive raves coming up. And some of you were worried that I was gunna die, pfft. Met quiet a few people since no one I knew was there. Too bad that I didnt care enough to get their numbers or anything at 7am.. but daaamn. It was just unbelievable."

A little comment Brandon made today at work about it when I told him I can work the morning before it.. ""In the morning?"" -""Yes, the morning before the rave"" ""You wanna work before the rave?"" ""Yes!"" ""Do you wanna take the rest of the week off *laughs*"" ""*growls* No, I'll be fine"". So I will definatly enjoy it. Got my white kitty costume almost done.. gotta buy those shoes though. Too bad some of ya who I really wanted to come arent coming.. *tear* You're missing one helluva night. Last event of the Pacific Colisium 'till probably when Playland opens again. I'm so glad I got my ticket early, they are almost ALL sold out. The tickets that arent are quiet pricy lol.. I feel sorry for those who have to buy em at that price. W00tness. 9 days left, seems like forever. NINE DAYS PEOPLE!"

They are all gorgeous, they are all potentially good boyfriends (seem to be nice guys). I actually asked out Noga, BUT he's a stoner.. meaning, I'd be repeating the whole dating Zac thing. If it turns out that way I'll.. . Actually I'm going to ask him tomorrow or something how he likes his relationships, if it doesnt fit me- he can just be my gorgeous friend. Going to see a movie with Tony on saturday, he's so excited, its so cute.. damn them virgins, they just tempt us all to be that much more evil. I'm trying to force Allon to just ask the goddam Sebastian.. Well we moved English rooms, and this one is smaller and arranged differently.. he sits.. uh.. on my right.. with his desk touching mine.. so he's.. not even a foot away from me. Damn he's hot. And Tim, I forgot to mention Tim.. he was another lust from first sight.. why do guys have to have sexy voices, looks and personalities.. grr. But I called him once, he was at school.. havent called him since. Aaryn told me to go for Jared, but.. how the hell would that ever happen, I see him maybe once in two weeks.
So.. going to see that movie saturday. Hanging with Noga sunday(mebbe). Working most of the time.. Oh, my contacts arrived today.. mmmm nice and white. Maybe I'll wear em to school tomorrow and freak people out. Sounds like an awesome idea. So, I'm going to go do my Math homework and then to bed. 'Night all."

Anyways about half an hour into work I got these razor sharp pains in the tummy but worked through it 'till closing. I had shitloads of dishes and near the end I was so close to to just saying ""sorry I need to go home"" 'cause the moving and lifting jsut made the pain worse.. but the little angel of a manager Brandon helped me. He's so great... his gf so doesnt deserve him. Grr get him Aaryn! You deserve someone that awesome. Man he's just indescribable.. I doubt anyone of you have every had such an endlessly amazing manager.
P.S. - Aaryn.. his favourite video game is Hockey.. :P
Going into work tomorrow morning.. hopefully I wont be in pain and wont look annoyingly slow. I love working there.. oh and Nikki, I asked if he needed anyone at the moment and mentioned that you came in and applied this morning and he was just like ""not at this moment"" ""oh, this laminated thing, I didnt want ruin it"" and looked at the application in the little plastic folder thingy so weirdly.. Heh.. mmm. lol

Soo apparently we (Tourism class) are taking a trip to.. WHISTLER. Why? Fun. Uhh.. so random field trip to WHISTLER. Man, I love this high school!
The other day I was at out first Student Council meeting. We were coming up with every idea possible to make this school year that much more fun. The guy who runs with (name unknown, some random teacher) accepted every idea suggested and just kept repeating how we have unlimited funds. OMG!! I love this school even more. We can do ANYTHING. W00T! Why didn't I transfer to Fox before? Hella Beats me.
So for the billionth time, takin the bus from work.. Crisco always has to be there. Why? Oh god why! I kinda feel like he's stalking me which cant possibly be it. But grrr. Also I've been seeing Gordy around A LOT. Seems weird 'cause he knows me and yet we dont talk.. but at least I dont find him err, whats the word for it.. just very un..likable lol.

"event","So as always, fun day at work. It wasnt actually ""fun"", there wasnt much to do so that was resolved by talking lol. Kevin is so nice,  I love talkin with him.. although dont really do it *that* much, I dont know why.. maybe 'cause I think he'd rather be left alone or maybe doesnt wanna hear from me. Meh, assumptions. So... tonight when I came in Kevin was doing my dishes and it took me a little bit to get my 'spot' back.. and as I started, Brandon joined me.. doing them 100times faster than me until he pretty much took over. So I was left standing there confused 'cause well, he's takin away my work. Not that I'm complaining.. Turns out I had to 'learn' to cut the turkey. So, the cutting part was easy... now the weighing part..... Uh... lol. I wrapped all of them 2.5lbs by the scale and looked at the pieces and they seemed so small in the end, so I cleared scale and it turns out.. more than half of what I've wrapped, was less than the scale showed before so I had to redo it.. gaaaaah. Brandon called me turkey as he left, sure anything sounds cute coming from him but when thinkin about it.. turkey? grr lol. But yeah, Kevin is really nice.. Grr, I dont like meeting such nice people, makes disliking everyone all together a lil bit harder because there is hope for humanity in those few wonder people I meet.
Anyways talked to.. hm I'm not 100% sure of the guy's name.. Brandon too I think, in my Art class. I've met him before when we were trying to buy E off Gordy. The past week we've seen each other around but never said anything.. As I was putting my stuff in my bag at the end of class, I lift my head up.. and he's, out of nowhere, sitting beside me. We had a little talk, he seemed really nice.. I hope we continue 'communicating'. He's also really good looking. Grr, like a puppy.. damn those guys that remind me of puppies. And he's not a druggie like I thought he was when I first met him, he promised to his mom he'd never touch that stuff again and hasnt.. cause ""He loves his mommy"" (his words). I even pushed the topic of doing them again but he completely denied. Thats so awesome.
After school mom picked me up and we went to the mall, I got myself a skirt.. and gettin my shoes back tomorrow.. so on monday I can be all purty and girly LOL. I swear those shoes will be the end of me.
Overall, I had a good day.. I'm happy. Hope you all had a nice day too. Gnite."

I swear if someone told these people ""You know, there is such a thing like being positive"" they'd shit their pants. This is why its crucial for me to move out. I'm a freaking happy person, I like being this way.. I DO NOT like when people do their best to try to aggravate me or make me upset. FUCK YOU. Learn to fuckin live through your problems and not bring everyone else around you into them.. maybe others are happy and you are ruining THEIR lives now. Now some of you may be reading this and getting some emotions thinking this is about you. Telling you now. It is not. This is been brought on by my parents and ONLY by them. They are the two most negativly 'set' people in the frickin world. Or like *the unsaid* they have both gained 24/7 PMS. I swear pretty soon I'll just pull my knife on them and tell them to shut the fuck up. Grrr they get me SO mad, and I bottle it inside 'cause if I say anything.. its just going to be worse and I'll get ever MORE mad.
Other than that, went shopping again.. FUCKING STERLING. I'M NEVER BUYING SHOES FROM YOU AGAIN. Okay so I bought these really purty shoes that I liked, when I tried to put my foot in the them without the sock thingy my little toe felt really uncomfortable (this was now at home) so I decided once the weekend comes I'll return them. HA! The little manager bitch there looked at the bottoms and was like ""these have been worn, they arent returnable because I wouldnt be able to sell em'. GO FUCK YOURSELF. I couldnt even put my foot in those things at home and they are ""worn""???????? I just wanted a razor right there and then to slowly cut through her eyeballs. And its not just me that actually cares about that.. I was upset because this just pissed my mom off even more. So now she said ""I'll try to make them more comfortable for you"" and she's expanding them or something.. and I'm going to make her do that until I can wear them without a problem, AND the bitch better not charge me one cent for em.
Okay, but anyways.. I bought myself a whole buncha asian food that I'm happy with and little chinese ornaments, to snakes ('cause thats the year I was born in) and two little ponies.. so adorable. And I have the day off.. maybe I'll get myself wasted eh. That'll make this day better. Buh Bye."

Oh well, at least now I have something motivating me to come to school at 8 in the morning... Mmmmmmmmm.
School is going good, cant really complain... didn't realize 'till today that I'm a senior. Feels nice. This term I got stuck with English, Spare, Tourism, Art and Math 10 (again.) Love my english teacher (all of them turn out to be funnest teachers ever for me lol..) During spares I get to finish off the homework that I never bother to do in the evening. Tourism is a total bore.. I honestly dont know why she doesnt just fill out the books for us and hand us that cirtificate. My art teacher is totaly great.. we pretty much come into the class, and do our own thing.. it doesnt even have to be for art class! And well, even though I'm repeating this boring Math class again.. this teacher isnt horrible although he doesnt quiet explain everything the way I would like but I'm actually not dreading having him the entire year anymore.

At one point I was actually bored.. I did the two task thingies for today and yesterday (since it was so busy yesterday and we closed around 11 I didnt have time to do it). Kevin helped me 'cause he had nothing to do earlier either. Heh, he's so nice. I like him. I felt kind of bad standing there searching for something to do because all the dishes were done and the rest were comin in so slow that yeah...
Talked to Brandon and his sexy self let me switch shifts from monday to tuesday. *greatful* Now I can hang out with Ryan.. man I havent seen/heard from him in so long. Funny thing is, the other day when I did, it was so sad. He kept blaming himself for ruining some chance with me or something and how wonderful I am and that he was stupid to fuck it up and all.. Weird eh? Although I have no idea how he fucked anything up and he wont believe it. He was a nice guy just picked the wrong times of wanting to go out. And his friend Tim is cute, he got so jealous when I said that LOL. Man I really hate it how a lot of my friends are moving far away.
So tomorrow, well I wanted to hang out with Chris but I dont think I'm going to be able to reach him before tomorrow morning and I have to work at 5:30 so.. oh well. Maybe I'll go and try to cheer Shane up.
School starts Tuesday. Guess what? I am not in *any* school at the moment. When I'm going to actually transfer I have no idea but I doubt I'm going to starting school on time.
And well, I got home from work way too late to go to PNE. I'm quiet disappointed in that but maybe I'll go with Ryan on monday. I hope you guys that went, had fun. You got yourself one hell of an awesome man Laurel, really happy for you and hope it will all always work out.
I am planning on drinkin sunday night or monday so if anyone wants to join you are more than welcome to. Good night all."

"event","So today was interesting.. Went out to Ridge with Nikki, got ourselves appointments for the piercings. Stopped by San Francisco and bought ourselves a few things. Got back, hung out for a bit.. and I ended up running onto the bus.. Heh, sorry Nikki :P
Well as most of you know. I've declared myself incapable of keeping a relationship now. It doesnt bother me, I'm just glad I finally decided that I have that problem. Oh well. But as my and Shane's conversation showed.. I've somehow turned myself off. I just simply do not care about anything anymore. My feelings are sort of absent. I'm here as maybe a shell of that girl I used to be. Nothing is really serious to me anymore. Its all some kind of a joke or a game. It keeps me happy no matter what comes along because its all amusing. I, subconciously know this is quiet horrible and not healthy. But really, does it matter? I like being this way. Sure in the long term it will probably interfere with a lot of things but I'm happy so who cares?!! I'm entertained, I have fun, my motivation comes out of nowhere. It is a good thing.
So recently a few of my friends lost ones they have grown attached to. Thats really a shame. The two couples seemed so happy together... But this is life I guess, things do go wrong. But it was those two people that I was so happy to see finally.. well, getting attached to someone. They deserved something good. I really didnt want those relationships to ever falter or anything.. All I can hope for is that something even better comes their way.
So, today after work I head to Playland with my fiance. Should be a blast. Gotta love the fun Nikz :P And you all know how long I've been waiting for a chance to go to Playland. Plus Chris and others are going there too today. Even better. I kinda wish I could at least make Chris feel better somehow, he really liked that girl..
Anyways I'm going to head to bed because well, work in the morning. Good night.

[PS - there is no way I'm working Monday. Ryan is moving and its the last chance I get to hang out with him and he already planned this before, so I gotta talk to Brandon about moving my shift anywhere but Monday. Although I do realize it's labour day, but I need to say bye to this friend...]"

I dont know what to say though.. he still thinks he knows me better than I know myself. LMFAO. Whatever helps you sleep at night. But I am glad you finally established that you  *HATE* me. LOL.

[Forgot to post this earlier.] I dont know why everyone is so surprized that I like working there. Its a freaking easy job... I get money for doing almost nothing. Or it seems like so. But I still think I'm quiet slow... Oh well.

My hate for techno seems to have almost vanished. Still most of the time I cant stand Max's music, but what I download and pick out as acceptable - I like. And I absolutly cannot wait for that Rave. I have a costume picked out and everything.. just OMG, it will be so amazing.

I am still going to try and attend Strung Out. Dont know how it will be possible but I will try. I found a few people that actually like it too. Amazing. Even though most of them mostly listen to hardcore.

And I'm gettin a new acoustic. YAY. Wont have to re-string this one. Glee *so happy*.. at least now when I'll be bored I wont have to torture myself with this old thing. lol. Man I'm glad I'm getting back to my instruments again.. I've had this guitar for how many years? And I barely ever use it.. kinda sad. Oh well, learned the chords and Ricky and his guitar teacher are a great help since they are both so awesome at playing lol.

Omg! I really want to go on that hike though. I'm starting to really dislike you lazy people lol. JK. You know I love you guys. But you have to admit, most of you spend a tiny bit too much time on the computer/in your houses.

Also I find it quiet amusing how that particular group has become totaly useless. I needed at least one of them before to get me drugs.. now not only do I have a way of getting any drug cheap - I quit. LOL! :D Gnite.

I want to work tomorrow...

PS - I love crazy frog.
PPS - I hope you have fun at PNE with Grant Nikz :P
PPPS - I love how some people, even though they hate me - Waste time and energy on talking about me, or thinking about me. Makes me feel so loved LOL."

Towards the end the conversation came upon the topic of money/housing, so as my mom suggested if we all pay 250 a month we can still live here. HA FUCKING HA! I've already talked this over with her and she should know better than that, there is no fucking way I am staying in Pitt Meadows past December. She was totaly fine with that, quiet supportive actually so that was nice (before). But she sat there all quiet while dad had this look of astonishment on his face and began arguing the point of 'no you are not'. You know what though? Even if I am unable to get a place by December because of the lack of permission. I am simply going to move to a friend's house and they can deal with that however they want. They really have no choice in this matter.. I have given them like a year to try and find another place that we could live in as a family but they have done FUCKALL so they'll just have to bear with me visiting when I feel like it.
This just totaly surprized me. 'Cause I've said this before. Had a talk about it. And everyone should have been informed and supportive but aparently wife and husband dont really talk about their children eh.
So on a different note, I figured out why I dislike the 'seem to be perfect' human being - Mark. He sounds gay... he just does. Like his voice, I cant stand it. If he went and got his vocals somehow changed he'd be like the best catch ever. Am I really this shallow? I just find it really sick. And he is actually quiet obsessive.. or maybe I just think that 'cause I dont wanna hear his voice lol.
Tomorrow morning I go and figure out the school transfer shit. Hey, even if it all goes horribly wrong.. I can pretty much work two full time jobs while I take a year off school. Sure that will hurt my future horribly. But again, there is no way in hell I am attending the shithole of Pitt for another year. And every respectable school in Ridge is unaccessible and I despise the rest of them.
I was supposed to do this today, but I woke up too late. I was also supposed to go for a hike.. that plan kinda went to shit. I work tomorrow though which is awesome and then Thursday I'll either go for the hike or go have some.. err fun. So, right now.. I want to tell quiet a few people to go suck some cock.."

"event","I dont know. Went to Ridge today again to hang out with Mark and his best friend Tony.. and some other people. Damn even they are stoners. I quit. If I'll buy weed it would be for the doobies that i'd smoke after work to relax. Other than that, I just want to experience something new before school starts and I focus on life.. We'll see. But yeah, can't go out with Mark anymore.. They got me high and I just found him way too clingy. That was really awkward. *might* still stay friends with him.
So this weekend I gotta try something new, no matter what. So if people want to do something, I got moneyz to spend. Otay. I'm done.
Oh and I really pissed off Justin the other day even though I didnt mean it just all went horribly wrong. >.>
Good night all, might be workin saturday."

<P>While I may be good at listening. Supportive. With very many suggestive ideas and I am understanding. I'M NOT A GODDAM SHRINK.<BR>See, now it has come to this again. Dad takin up an hour to explain his troubles to me and trying to understand why its all that way and just sitting there like I could offer some ultimate solution to solve all his problems. I'm not god either. I mean yes, as your daughter you're entitled to talk to me once in a while but o m g. And I mean the first 10 mins its okay, I'll show sympathy, word of advice or two - showing that I understand this situation and still cannot do much about it. I wish he'd just stop right there.</P>
<P>The upside though is that I wont have to listen to them bitch out each other every freakin' morning when I'M TRYING TO SLEEP! ..and some of you wonder why I always feel like gettin up around 2pm.</P>
<P>So the Muffgoat show is today at 5pm. I may be attending, err.. spending more money *thumbs down*. I swear I spend it a million times faster than I earn it. Boo, should just ditch that and attend a BBQ with Mark :D lol<BR>Anyways, you all have a good day =P</P>"

"event","So the job went well. I think. I kinda feel guilty though about leavin some stuff. I'm a perfectionist - I havent changed. Damn. Oh well, next time I wont let anyone talk me out of making everything perfect.
Guy wise. Yes there is a new guy. Damn I get em fast eh? Though this one is going to be like Ryan, nothing serious so I wont get hurt or anything. I liked how it ended with Ryan, no tears, no pain. But Mark seems like such a sweetie, man... don't they all? Eventually I'll stick with one though.. can't be a never ending search. Actually its not even a search with me. They randomly show up and I give 'em a chance.
Went and saw Skeleton Key tonight(sp?). Padley made it halarious.. It was supposed to be a horror right? Oh well. I think we annoyed some people by all the laughing. I liked it. Didnt really appeal to me in any way but it was an Okay movie.
Tomorrow I am drinkin' with Kevin. 'Cause I promised him. I really shouldn't make promises 'cause usualy the next day I'm so tempted to break them for something better. But never do. And even if he cancels - then I get to go to the BBQ :D Weeh.
I still REALLY want to go to PNE. Damn eh? I'll go, if not this week then next.. I just really need to go.

Well I really dont know what else to say. Life is good. (Isnt it always?:P) So I hope you all feel the same.
Good Night."

Oooh.. Tania is havin' a beach party. Well not really her. Its her friend's birthday 'party' but if anyone is interested msg me :P. Should be fun.
Today, is going to be unlike yesterday. No matter what. I swear I was ready to kill a shitload people yesterday. I need to not forget to call those guys today, god, I'm really too nice.
Well I applied at ABC. Went in for interview. Had a pretty good chance.. and I guess I still do? lol. I really hope I get that job. Even if I will be payed 6 bucks an hour to wash dishes and stuff.
I'm getting fed up with my parents to the point that I just want to kick them out of the house. But hey, the sooner I get the job the sooner I move the fuck outta this place. 
Anyhootz, you all have a nice day."

"event","Eat breakfast. Go on this upstairs computer.. and hear kids yelling outside as usual. This little 10 year old fatso is yelling 'You dont know how hard MY life is bitch!' to some other little kid. So he makes his point of 'I cant run, you know how hard MY life is?' 'I cant play any sport. Can only play spots that require almost no running'. The other lil kid - 'You can be a goalie'. 'There are only three sports in which there are goalies and I dont even like two of them that much'. 'And you know how much my parents yell at me?'. Go lose some fucking weight!!! Man, the troubles of little fat kids everywhere -.-
But uh yeah. NIKKI IS BACK!!! YAYNESS! And currently gone to Vancouver without me *tear*. Oh well, I have you saturday :D Glee. Mine, all mine. Scary eh?

"event","Mhmm, non the less I had fun today. Even though I didnt go drinkin with those guys.. I wonder what they did tonight. lol.
You know what I strongly dislike? When people dont respond. Dont.. answer lol. Jerks.

Random thought about relationships. They are only true and will last IF you really respect the person. If you sort of look up to them and view them as something great. If there isnt that respect towards each other then its a bad relationship and someone is probably being used. I guess this goes for friend aswell. Hm.

Anyways good night :P"

"event","Went to CKY, if I didnt have any alcy and weed I wouldnt have enjoyed myself as much as I did. It was a good time. Nothing GRAND.
Ryan, I miss having that 'I have a bf' security. 'Cause he's not sure of something right now and wanted some time to figure things out. So its more of a break then a break up.. but since most breaks end up as break ups I just view it as one. Oh well. I got him to have fun with him, and all the time I did that, and still will, so.. guess nothing bad is coming out of this 'break' lol.
Been getting back to my guitar these days.. learning such easy songs as Fade to Black n Unforgiven n practicing Enter Sandman, Otherside, Wherever-Whenever, My Immortal, Caress Me Down and Lovin Is What I got, 7Nation Army, Simpsons, Star Wars, and some random tunes Ricky taught me :D Heh.. only thing I hate is how not used to the strings my fingertips are.. oh well.

"event","I wake up this morning.. and, I got a cold. Nothing big, nothing bothersome.. just a cough here and there. So I figure like any other cold I get these days it'll go away by tomorrow or friday. But thinking about my immune system nowadays and how non existant I have made it.. it may not - that would suck. So today I've been all blah.. could have been more productive but theres the lack of energy and motivation. These are the sort of days I wish Ryan wasnt working, so we could curl up on his couch in front of the TV, having a hot cup of.. whatever. Even though thats not possible, its nice just thinking about it.
Yeah, I'm gettin cold now so I'm gunna go wrap myself in my blanky :D Gnight."

Oh well, I guess I already attended some so.. yeah. Its not a big deal if I dont go to the finale.. although it feels kind of wrong not to -.- Oh well, selling lsd right now so if you want any - gimme a call. But Im off to sev to grab a slurpee and then Ryan should be here anytime now :D
So now matter what you guys are doing - Have fun and enjoy whatever it is, 'cause it is summer :D"

Its FRIDAY!!! lol. *so happy* Man, I love when the week ends. Even though summer has gone by so damn fast, I mean we only have one teeny month left. Thats not much. Oh well I guess its better than thinkin that summer was long and boring. Yay for being busy.
Which brings me to my next point. Some people have to realize that over 85% of the time - I'm NOT at home! Gah, you people. I'm either earning money or spending time with friends and the only way to really reach me is by cell.. or if its not urgent = email. Anyways still have to choose which 'plans' I will go through with today, either way its all good.
Theres one little thing I found funny though. He used to whine about how this is not the place and he had to be elsewhere to be liked and now 'cause I dont know, hell froze over, he changed his mind. Whatever, guess for some its good to hang around people that constantly say shit behind one's back. But I'm off, 'cause I need money and money needs me heh. Enjoy yet another sunny day you guys."

Then got it and brought it over to the middle. Completely wrapped it so many times and then sat there somehow eating it and it was gone. It was so amazing lol. I mean I've seen it done on TV and stuff but yeah.. lol. Shut up.
I misses Nikki :( 2 more weeks? Too long, COME BAAAACK!
...oh and Hindus are jews.. I hate 'em all. Gawd I'm fuckin racist, but oh well.. I am hated for being Russian so why cant I hate other races too? lol. I know its not an excuse, but I dont know why I'm so damn racist - I just somehow find many things wrong with/annoying about other races,... even Russians.
Anyways, *misses Ryan*. More like, *misses the fuckin fun time we ALWAYS have*. Just a few more days... heh :D He's such a sweetie.
SHOPPING TOMORROW :D GLEEE. There is no place I like to shop more than the US. I still need glowsticks though.. anyone know where I could buy a lot? Good ones.. cheap? lol.
CKY - What kind of beer do you people drink? 'Cause knowing me I'll go into the liquor store, stand there for half an hour trying to figure out what Canadians like.. and then pick some shitty beer either way. (Even though in my opinion it is ALL shitty).
Saturday - What are some good movies and who wants to come? lol.. I need to check what the hell is playing lol.. I wonder if there is anything good.
Oh and its official. After the show - I quit E for good. Hah, no hard drugs for me what so ever.. I wont even let Ryan do coke. I love having power lol. Anyways I'm going to browze through stuff on the net and pass out. Have a good night you guys."

"event","Has anyone out there ever taken an online class? I ask because I'm curious about your experiences with it, because I'm trying to feel out this poetry class I'm taking. 

So far, I'm not too impressed. The rigor of this class is quite low--which, actually, is probably good for me right now because I don't really want to devote a huge amount of time to it. I'm just trying to decide if the unimpressiveness of it is because it's an online class, because it's community college and thus a huge range of student abilities, or because I'm just not putting enough into it myself. 

My theory is that online classes don't really lend themselves to the kind of discussion that in-person (real time? real life?) classes do. You can very easily hide behind a computer screen, after all. There are no awkward pauses when a teacher asks a question and no one answers; you don't actually have to do any reading that you don't want--just post about what you DO want to write about; no one even really knows who you are so there's very little sense of accountability. heh. As a teacher myself, it's funny to read that, since the answer, of course, is simply that I should be holding myself as accountable as I want to be. It's just funny to me that the class seems set up for you to do what you want, not for you to be pushed or stretched into something better. 

I guess the big question is whether online learning actually lends itself to rigor and intensity or not. In some sense, an online discussion--where you publish your comments and thoughts in writing, semi-permanently--seems like a great forum for people to really think about, revise, and ultimately post their best thinking. On the other hand, the world of the internet is all about bite-sized anecdotes and snippy commentary: respond to the poem in two sentences that show more about your wit than about your real thoughts or understanding about the work. So far, the ""discussion"" has been mostly what I expect from the internet: people posting their own thoughts but seeming to interact very little with the thoughts of others. I'm the only one so far who's responded to anyone directly, or said anything about ""I agree with Rebecca on this point, but question her here..."" That kind of engagement is kind of what I'm looking for if I'm going to get better at anything, and so far I'm not really seeing it. Is that because of the medium, or because of the people involved? 

That being said, I <i>am</i> actually enjoying the class--mostly, I think, because what it lacks in rigor it provides in deadlines and an impetus to think about, read about, and write my own poetry. That's what I ultimately want, though it'd be sweet to actually get some feedback that helps me be better at it.

"event","So. It's a new year and I'm determined to get the most out of it. Perhaps it's because I've been out of school for almost three weeks now (the last week of school before break was totally canceled because of snow), but I'm feeling rested, optimistic, and ready to take on the world. I'm fixing my super sexy road bike, which has been out of commission since I snapped the chain a few months ago. I just bought new running shoes--trail running this time, which means I'm making a commitment to actually run on trails. James just bought his first pair of running shoes, which I hope means that I'm also making a commitment to get him into running (or at least hardcore powerwalking:). I just registered for an online poetry writing class; I don't know much about it yet aside from the sentence-long catalog description, but I'm pretty excited. I've made conscious efforts to reach out to the people I want to be better friends with. I'm contemplating an ultramarathon in May.

Clearly, I'm overcommitting myself because of all the free time I've had. But right now, I'm feeling stoked and raring to go. Bring it on!"

"event","Portland is a wintery wonderland. Ever since Sunday, it's been snowy and cold cold cold--the result being that the city has turned into even more of a walking/biking/bussing city than ever. When I went running on sunday, in the midst of as much of a blizzard as Portland, I'm sure, ever sees, the streets were practically deserted--but once I got to Mt. Tabor, it seemed that half the neighborhood had walked there with garbage bags and makeshift sleds--even a few snowboards--to take advantage of the snow-covered hills. 

Even today, in the frigid sun, the cars were eclipsed by people being pulled down the icy streets by their dogs or walking with careful steps, all bundled up and beanied and mittened and red-cheeked. 

I love how gleeful people here are about snow. (It helps that school is canceled at the drop of a hat:) Of the Mt. Tabor sledders, most were my age or older. It made me smile so big I thought my lips would crack from the cold--here we all are, semi-responsible adults, and the first thing we think of to do when it snows is to bundle ourselves up and go flying down some hills. Life is good, here in Portland:)"

"event","Inspired both by looking at old classwork and by a conversation with Mat this evening, I decided to look up potential creative writing classes for this winter or spring. I'm not sure how serious I really am about this, but it'd be sweet to be surrounded by other people trying to write things, to get feedback and, honestly, to have deadlines and assignments for a while so I get shit down. I'd like the push.

Unfortunately, it's a lot harder to take classes when you're already in school all day. I mean, it makes sense, right? Night classes are less plentiful, the options are fewer, the quality of class may or may not be there... I know all that, but I was still quite disappointed to discover that there's nothing interesting, either at PSU or any of the many PCC campuses, that I could conceivably get to on time. There's nothing even at Lewis and Clark, not that I would pay for that anyway.

It makes me really thankful that I had a set-aside period of my life in which I went to school full time, where work was a side thing fit into a school schedule and not the other way around. Thanks, Mom and Dad, for making education a priority for me."

"event","One of my co-workers took me trail running today! Man. We went out to the Gorge, up the trail to Wakeena Falls and Devil's Rest and back down--about 8 miles all told, all on dirt and fallen leaves (and some ice:), by gorgeous creeks, under waterfalls, and with spectacular views of the Columbia River. 

It was so fricken awesome. 

Because of another 7th grade cold, the running was a bit snotty and heavy-breathed, but godDAMN was it a thrill. The best part was when John and I both blew past this dude hiking down the trail (being sure to pass respectfully, of course:) and then both <i>totally</i> ate it, first him, then me in exactly the same spot, turning a slushy corner. heh. I'm sure we prompted some good head-shaking from the hiker who saw us as total goobers, but aside from that instance of giving other trail runners a bad name, we did pretty well for ourselves, I think. Well, John does it all the time so he, at least, looks like some kind of crazy gazelle bounding down the trail; I'm sure I looked a little less sure-footed and a bit more ponderous.

But damn. I wish I could spend all day running trails. Ever since I moved away from SW Portland, I've been running mostly streets. So it was rad to be out in the middle of nowhere, no pavement in sight, and miles and mile and miles of wilderness to be explored. 

I think he's going to take me again next weekend. I'm stoked."

"event","So we've already been over how I didn't end up coaching cross country this year but DID get to ride the pace bike at our home meets. Well, this Wednesday, coaching or no, I got to strut my stuff in the end-of-season race: cross country team vs. any willing staff members. 

It was pretty sweet. All my cross country kiddos were like ""dude! Ms. Honnold's not on a bike! She's RUNNING!"" It was hard for them to believe, since I <i>always</i> have my bike. Of course, once they got over their shock, they were quick to start the shit talking, most of it variations on the theme of how badly they were going to kick my butt now that I was bikeless. heh. And being the sneaky (and perhaps overly competitive) person that I am, I meekly agreed with them, all the while plotting my surprise victory. 

So, something those of you who don't spend a lot of time with 7th graders should know is that those suckers are speedy! Not necessarily for long distances, but DAMN do they take off at the beginning of a race! It's like they're little rubber bands or something, just waiting to shoot off into the distance (I suppose this is about what one should expect, given their crazy energy). I, on the other hand, find my pace about 2 miles in--which doesn't help much in a race that's only 2k. But I'd sort of made a pact with myself that I would try to at least keep up with this girl in my 1st period class who's usually a top finisher for the girls' team, since I figured that if I could keep up with her, I would at least avoid totally embarrassing myself in front of my current and previous students. So when the race started I shot off with them much, much faster than I would ever start any run on my own--and then realized about halfway through that though it sucks at first, after the initial shock to the lungs it actually feels pretty good to go that fast so quickly. And I also realized that though 7th graders are speedy as all get out, that doesn't mean they necessarily have much stamina. heh. So I slowly took them down, sure to grin wildly at them as I sped by;) 

End of story is that I finished ahead of all the girls and 10th place overall, being beaten by two other staff members and 7 speedy 8th grade guys. And apparently I totally smashed the previous female-staff-member record by over 2 minutes, which is pretty awesome for a race that only lasts about nine (although it doesn't say much about the previous record). 

The point, though, is not (only) that it was a super fun race, but that it was so awesome to interact with my kids in a non-school way like that. They're totally different people when they're outside doing something active, and as I was telling James, it's fun to be doing something with them where I'm not the teacher but actually someone equal, competing for the same thing. (Not to mention it will be fun on Monday to give all the guys I beat some shit about how easy it was to blow by them. heh.) It was awesome, though, and definitely made me give some consideration to taking track on come spring. It's a bit more grueling, time-commitment-wise, so I'm not sure, but it certainly was fun to be with my kids outside of my classroom."

"event","Next door to us, there's this super cute old man--you know, one of those guys who goes by Bud even though that's not his real name, who lends us his ladders and power tools, who jokes about hopping our fence and stealing things from our garden late at night (he often hinted that we should plant easter lilies since those were his particular favorite), who has a pirate flag in his car and a ""pirates only"" sign in his front window. He has an old, nasty cat called Angel who he loves, and a wife who seemed 30 years older than him. Her name is Leigh, and whenever we talk of our neighbors, we always refer to them as ""Budlee,"" collectively.

Every few days, we see Bud pull his car out of their garage, stop it right by their front door, go back inside, and then painstakingly escort Leigh out, down their three steps, and into the passenger's seat--they go out to breakfast or their weekly shopping trip, inevitably coming back with at least two bags full of honey bunches of oats. Or sometimes he'd walk her down the steps and around the block, her halting, painful steps supported by his arm and matched by his own patient stride. 

James and I missed this while we were at the market this weekend, but apparently Saturday morning Budlee's house was thronged by an ambulance and fire rescue truck; Leigh was rushed out of the house by stretcher. And when I talked to Bud on Sunday, he told me that she'd died. Just like that. 

I mean, she was old--much older than he seemed, though it turns out that she was only 90 to Bud's 84. He told me how she'd always joked that she was robbing the cradle. And though the thought of her joking is unfathomable to me--I only know her as an almost-incapacitated, grumpy-seeming old woman, not capable of humor--that detail just about breaks my heart. They'd been together for 58 years. And when I look over at Bud's house now--not Budlee's anymore, but only Bud's--and see him alone through his kitchen widow, it makes me want to cry and cry. 

Last night as we were making dinner, the light in his kitchen kept going on and off. He'd appear and do some kitcheny things, then turn the light off, only to come back a few minutes later, leave again, come back again, all the while in his old man pajamas. It was so lonely and heartbreaking. I was imagining him doing all this stuff alone for the first time in 58 years--waking up alone, making dinner alone, going back to read the paper, all the while with no Leigh beside him. Does he even know what to do with himself in that house without her? 

Oh, Bud. Here is is again out my window, taking his trash out, seeming as brave and cheerful as ever, and all I want to do is run over and give him a hug. You're a strong man, Bud, and we're here for you."

"event","It's funny that there are no classes on how to be an adult. I think that kind of thing--though somewhat pathetic-sounding, I'm sure--would be extremely valuable, especially when you come across something that you have no idea how to do but that everyone else seems to navigate with no problem. 

Take finding a doctor, for example. I've never been a particularly regular doctor-goer, though back in the day when I DID have some kind of checkup schedule (i.e. when I was a small child), whatever doctor I saw magically appeared by virtue of my parents' insurance. In college, with the exception of a bike-induced trip to the emergency room--also supported by my parents' insurance--my visits to the doctor ended. And after college, when I was too old to keep pretending that I was dependent on my parents, I became one of the millions of people in this country without health insurance. 

So last year, when I finally got a regular, full-time, fully-benefitted job, I had no idea what to do it. I didn't find a doctor; I didn't find a dentist. I've always kind of figured that whatever's wrong with me will go away eventually as long as I continue to eat right, exercise, and otherwise take care of myself, so as long as I've been making the decision instead of having my parents make it for me, a doctor has always seemed like a rather unnecessary use of my time. Even if you can't eat-right-and-exercise-yourself out of cancer or some other such hideous health issue, those have never really seemed like live options to me, so I rather foolhardily continue assuming that everything is fine. But this year, when everyone and their mom was on my case about a persistent little cough--7th-grader-carrier-monkey induced, of course--I finally decided to find a doctor. Except that somehow, I missed the class about how one goes about doing that. 

I mean, I found one eventually, after a few frustrated calls to places not accepting patients and then finally to my insurance provider, but I wished through the whole process that I'd actually known how a normal person goes out and finds a doctor. Of course, when I talked to people afterward, I realized that most people actually do what I did: muddle through until they end up somewhere. And I guess that's how one navigates this weird adulthood after all--not by knowing how to do things, necessarily, but by knowing that if you're able to get information from people, you can eventually get things done that you don't actually know how to do. 

So anyway, all that to say that I did find a doctor, and all THAT to say that doctor and respiratory-infection-antibiotics or no, here I am AGAIN, home sick from <i>another</i> 7th-grade-carrier-monkey cold. It's starting to get rather frustrating, especially for someone who has always been mostly healthy and who eats well, doesn't smoke or partake of any other bad-for-you things (except maybe ice cream:), gets regular exercise--almost obsessively so, if you ask James--and otherwise does everything right to not be sick. I'm feeling a little betrayed by my own immune system, honestly, those punk white blood cells."

"event","Recently, I've been very inspired to start writing things and just as reluctant to finish them. Posts that start off seeming important, inspiring, insightful end up, halfway, seeming trite and ridiculous, just more fluff about me. Often, I save my aborted post-starts in my email drafts folder, imagining that when I look at them later I'll realize that they were actually pretty good (it's often an issue of being too close to what you're writing, after all), only to return to them and discover that they're even <i>more</i> lame than I first imagined. 

It's enough to put a girl off posting. 

And yet here I am, writing about how it seems that lately I can't write. 

I'm teaching an after school creative writing class with one of my coworkers; it's ironic that I'm so excited to help kids (and myself) through the creative writing process and also so concurrently unable to write about anything on my own. I have all these projects in mind--some creative, some for other people, some just because I want to understand some things and writing makes them clear to me in a way that thinking or talking never does--and yet I haven't been able to get past the first few sentences. Is that writer's block? Am I totally out of writing practice? Is this what people mean when they say they just don't know what to write?

I never put much stock in writer's block. It always seemed like a convenient excuse--I don't want to write this paper, for example, so I'm just procrastinating under the guise of waiting for inspiration. Sure, I believe (firmly) that it's hugely productive to let your mind stew for a while--say, go for a run while you let your story untangle itself in your head instead of just forcing yourself to write write write--but I <i>don't</i> believe that inspiration is just this magical thing that comes from nowhere. Maybe you need to do something else for a while while your brain works out a problem on some other channel, but that's just attacking what you're doing from a different direction before you come back to it reinvigorated. So saying that I've been uninspired lately is just a cop-out: maybe I've been lazy, or maybe I'm out of practice, or maybe I'm just trying to write about the wrong things, but somewhere in here is what I need to be writing--and I'll keep working on it, and I'll find it eventually."

"event","1. One of my students got lost coming back to our classroom after our first fire drill yesterday. Even though our school isn't super big, physically speaking, it's actually not that weird that he would be disoriented what with all the construction still going on--we made our winding way out to the field through unusual doors and around a maze of fences blocking off new grass--but it was super cute the way he eventually found his way back. Apparently, unable to find my room or remember my name, he asked people where the Language Arts room with the teacher who ""reads a whole bunch"" was. Someone eventually directed him to south hall, where he was eventually able to find us again. Cutie. 

2. It's ridiculous how much difference it makes to start a school year for the second time. It's also ridiculous how nice it is to have classes of 22, say, instead of 34. Plus, because of various (and quite fortuitous) circumstances, I ended up with a prep period that's almost an hour and a half every day instead of 57 minutes. So far, I am loving life. 

3. This year, I was sort of hoping that someone would ask me to help out with cross country, though I wasn't so eager as to actually volunteer to coach. Once they actually hired a coach, though, I was a little sad that I hadn't been more forthcoming about potentially wanting to do it, but here's the next best thing: I get to be the pace biker for our home meets! Yep, that means that come race day, I'm going to be out on a big old burly mountain bike making sure the front runners don't get lost on the course. I'm telling all my kiddos that they'd better get really fast, because I want them up there running with me. It's going to be pretty awesome. 

4. Unrelated to work, I'm somewhat worried that my brother is going to kill himself in the quest for epic climbing: http://www.alpinist.com/doc/web08f/newswire-honnold-solo-half-dome.

"event","During my run this evening, I came to a gnarly old man selling back scratchers on the corner of a somewhat large intersection. He was standing on the sidewalk, propping up a sign with one hand and brandishing a green back scratcher in the other, and he kept turning every which way to make sure each different direction of traffic had a chance to read his sign and inspect his scratcher. All the while he was singing, talking, yelling, with the refrain a continual testament to his superior back scratchers. 

The fact that it was just one guy, peddling his wares in traffic, surrounded by hundreds of differently-colored plastic objects; the fact that he was actually yelling out and interacting with people driving by (none of that braindead listening-to-headphones-while-you-hope-people-stop kind of business); the fact that he was selling a rather useless little thing but was doing it with such vigor reminded me so much of all the random street vendors in Senegal that I almost started crying.

"event","The school district I work for likes to start each school year with a big convocation--you know, where we all gather together (way too early in the morning), celebrate the work we do, get pumped up, listen to a motivational speaker, and emerge feeling inspired, appreciated, and energized. It's concurrently kind of sweet and totally ridiculous, and it only reminds me of how horrible an audience teachers tend to be. (How can we expect kids to listen to us if we don't even listen to each other? But that's a whole different story.)

One of the major themes of this year's convocation was that we need to embrace change, an idea that is all too appropriate for the construction war zone that is my school right now. Somehow, when I imagined all the remodeling and updating and whatnot that was going to happen this summer, I imagined it was going to be confined to exactly that: summer. But no, when I got there on Monday morning, what used to be a field was a giant sprawl of heavy equipment and makeshift parking lot, the whole front of the building was covered in scaffolding, the side wall of the gym was gone, and the hallways were lined with a miscellany of musical stands, waxing machines, paint, pipes, tables, and all manner of furniture ruthlessly divorced from its appropriate owners. All my classroom wall decorations had been taken down, my desks were all stacked and piled in one corner, and it was, basically, a giant, demoralizing mess. 

After the initial shock, though, it's actually turned out to be quite lovely--for me, anyway. Some people still don't have functional classrooms, and I'm sure they're much less philosophical about blessings in disguise than I am right now. But for me it's turned out to be a good way to symbolically start over. Setting up my room again means that I put conscious thought into where I want things to be so that I can get the best use out of them. Redecorating means that I have a better conception of how I'm going to use my space. Redoing everything forced me not just to rely on what I'd already done (mostly stuff I'd set up before I had any idea what I was doing), but actually tailoring everything to be just the way I want it to be to support my teaching. 

Of course, once students show up next week I'm sure I'll discover that I did everything totally wrong again this year, but I'm pretty excited about the changes I've made. I think I'm almost ready, too. The big thing remaining is to organize the almost $500 worth of books I just bought for my classroom library in a fashion that will entice even the most reluctant of readers to pick something up (wouldn't it be sweet if it were that easy?), but that's work that I'm enjoying. So far, so good this year; just think me happy thoughts for next week's descending hordes of children--all of whom are going to be shunted into our school, I'm told, through a giant tunnel, since our front doors still won't be operational."

You've got to love this logic. According to the district's superintendent, teachers having guns is actually going to reduce school violence (plus allow teachers to protect themselves and their students). He even blames school shootings on <i>not</i> having guns in school: ""When the federal government started making schools gun-free zones, that's when all of these shootings started."" So the answer to school shootings is, clearly, to give teachers guns so as to dissuade others from bringing guns to school. Makes sense, right?

***

So last night James found me sprawled on our bed with yet another book in hand. ""I love you in the summer,"" he said. ""You seem so happy."" 

I am happy. I've had time to take care of our garden; I've had time to read; I've had time to be outside; I've had time to see my family; I've had time to take care of our house, even the dumb things like dishes and laundry; I've had time to think--the operative thing here is simply that I've had time. Time time time. Something I felt like I never had during school. And now that there's more summer behind me than in front, I can't help but dread the imminent loss of it.

It's the total opposite of how I felt at the end of last year. Then, I remember writing that though there were definitely bad moments during the year, the good ones far outweighed them. That I couldn't wait to get better at teaching. That education seemed like a good place for me to be. Everything was full of potential. Granted, I knew that I was looking at the world through summer-colored glasses, but I was excited for some time off and then a better second year of teaching ahead. 

Now that a second year is imminent (eek! I want to do better, but HOW?:), I find myself remembering much more of what I <i>didn't</i> like about last year. Like, oh my god, in a few weeks my entire being is going to be totally consumed by hundreds of students. Oh my god, in a few weeks I will start getting up at 5:30 again and not getting home until 7--and even then, still having to plan the next day. Oh my god, I'll be staring down a whole new set of punks who I need to somehow convince not to kill each other (or me). Oh my god, I'm going to have no time, my houseplants are going to die, I'm going to stop seeing James altogether for days at a time because of our ridiculously not-matching schedules when I'm working, my friends are going to forget me because I'll never call them back, I'll forget what it feels like to read a book in a park, I'll forget that there are people in the world who aren't in 7th grade or who don't have a kid in 7th grade, and I'll generally become the crazy-stressed stasia I hated being last year.  

It's an amazing hurdle. I've had days where I've been really motivated to get things done and plan stuff for the upcoming year, but I've had more where I've been just <i>pissed</i> that I'm already having teaching stress dreams, that I have to go back to this thing that consumes me. I'm trying to hold onto everything that was good about last year and all the reasons I was so glad to be a part of education, but it's really hard for me right now.

I guess what I could use is some moral support and the reassurance that every teacher dreads going back to school to some extent. Really, I want someone who's been there to tell me that this new-found desire to apply for any job that starts at 9 and ends--<i>ends</i>, really--at 5 is a normal part of this teaching routine. That it'll get better. Right now it feels like gearing myself up to be punched in the face and kicked in the nuts or something, but it'll turn out okay, right?"

"event","I think this blog is too much about me. My blogging model has, until this point, largely been people writing not only from their own experience, which is fine, but only <i>about</i> their own experience. And though I like the insights gained from someone's well-written narrative, I think I'm getting to the point where that seems...not enough. Where it seems like if you're going to take the time to write--adding to the already oversaturated internet blogging world--it should be something more than a pithy recap of what you did, something more than (ugh) a scathing rant (please, world, no more internet rants), something more even than a well-written exploration of something that made you think. 

It may just have to do with the well-focused blog vs. the shotgun-approach personal blog, because lately I've been taken with a few political blogs that one of James' friends introduced me to, as well as a blog totally devoted to education about adolescent sexuality, and it makes me wonder if a personal blog is just going to seem silly in comparison to a more issue-focused one. I guess it comes down to the question of whether it's useful, really, to tell people how you feel about the myriad things in your own life (which may be issues that come up in other people's lives, or maybe not) or if it's more useful to focus on a few more centralized issues that you can attack from your own experience and knowledge but that signify something more than just the broad range of human experience. I'm not sure I'm doing a good job explaining this; I guess I just wonder if it's really enough to simply write about your life--even if it's a really well-written, well thought out exploration of specific things in your life--or if it's better to pick a few interesting issues that sure, come up in your life but are useful in and of themselves too, not just because they're part of your experience. 

Phew! Those were some long sentences, but maybe you get the point. I just feel like I need to do this differently. Not a blog for letting-people-know-what's-going-on-with-me purposes but more for the sake of actually imparting useful (for some, anyway:) information. I guess I was just slightly nauseated when I followed a link today to blogher--a ""community for women who blog"" and was confronted with blog up on blog about nothing but what people did, what they thought about what they did, and then people's reaction to what they did. The blog about adolescent sexuality was like a breath of fresh air--finally, something that has substance--amidst a stagnant pool of largely unimportant, self-reflective fluff. Confronted with a surfeit of me-me-me blogs, I was slightly horrified to feel like I was doing the exact same thing. So what that means for this blog I'm not sure, but I think it needs to change."

"event","Here's the deal: I think there's just something about walking around the world with plants. 

I used to think it was just flowers. Whenever I bought flowers and subsequently either walked or biked them to wherever they were going, two related things would happen. First of all, I'd get all these really cute smiles from people, most of whom probably thought I had a really sweet boyfriend who'd bought them for me. Then, expecting people's reactions and also feeling rather conspicuous on my own, I'd do my own damn fool smiling, which was probably only further interpreted by people as being super sweet, thus making them more smiley, and on and on. It's the quintessential example of finding what you expect to find in the world: expecting people to look at you and smile, you smile, so people look at you and smile. 

So I used to think that walking around with flowers was one of the best things in the world for putting myself in a great mood. But really, as I discovered today, the magic actually comes from walking around with any kind of plant. While I was wandering around this afternoon (after having actually (!) done some planning for school in a nearby park), I came across two blueberry plants that were bundled up outside someone's house with a sign that said ""free!"" James and I have been talking about planting blueberries, so I capitalized on the opportunity to put the potted one in my backpack and carry the other one home in the plastic bag it had been left in. 

Imagine a girl walking down the street, holding a blueberry bush in one hand and making her own shade with the other one that sticks up about two feet out of her backpack. It made a pretty funny sight, if I can trust the half-reflections from storefronts and car windows. And like carrying cut flowers, it garnered some great smiles from people, even some dude who asked me if I'd just swiped them from some poor sap's garden. And like carrying cut flowers, it made me super smiley to think of how silly I looked. So then when people walked past, I grinned at them like an idiot, and on the cycle went.

So it's not just flowers that make me the most giddy stasia in the world. I have a suspicion that it might be the entire plant kingdom. And that's all right by me:)"

"event","So reading an earnest middle-school picture of your life has got to be one of the most humbling, cringe-worthy things ever. I'm in Sacramento briefly before Mom and I head to Mexico (whee!:), and the requisite closet-raiding and cleaning has led me not only to my middle school yearbooks, which I was looking for, but also to some middle school journals, which I knew existed but wasn't really looking to find.

It's amazing how personal everything is in middle school. I mean, I see that all the time in my kiddos, but it's funny to then see it in myself. Me? Taking the hall pass from geometry so as to sneak love notes into others' lockers (though ultimately always chickening out at the end and then berating myself for my wimpiness later)?  Or me, passing notes in Science? Me, deciding that I hated my science teacher just because she switched the seating chart and Bina got to sit by the guy I liked whereas I was all the way across the room? (Bina, if you're reading this, I have some CRAZY shit about you in my journal!:) Or me, going on and on and ON about how I would die if no one gave me a carnation for Valentine's day and how unfair it was that I had to endure such hideously unrequited love? It's prime drama is what it is, coming from me, who hates drama. 

Thank god I grew up, yknow? Though as I was talking to mom tonight, I had the thought that however ridiculous middle school emotions are, it's all the same fundamental stuff as we feel now: the desire to be noticed, to be accepted, to be loved. It's just so much more raw and untried in middle school, and you're (or at least, I was) so ill-equipped to deal with it all yet. 

***

On a related side note, I found this list, presumably of things I wanted to do with my life, at the end of my journal (number 5 wasn't filled out) (keep in mind I wrote this when I was, oh, 12) :

1. Find out if David likes me and/or ask him out
2. Bike across the country
3. Hike up Half Dome
4. Go backpacking at Echo Lake
5.

Well. I think my time with David has passed--and though I guess there's still hope, I think I can say with pretty definite certainly that he doesn't like me. Probably for the best at this point, huh? As for the other three things, it's somewhat amazing to me that I 1) haven't actually done any of them yet, but 2) would still very much list those as things I want to do with my life. I guess there are some aspects in which I haven't changed all that much from my crazyass middle school self. Kind of scary, perhaps, but comforting in that it gives me <i>some</i> threads of continuity between me as I conceive of myself now and this other past stasia who seems so foreign.

Anyone else have any crazy middle school stories? I'm feeling nostalgic and would love to hear from you..."

"event","When I bike to work in the mornings, there are certain other bikers who I almost always see. Though our paths often cross at different points--my start time, at least, varies depending on how early I want to be at school, so sometimes I'll pass someone at the beginning of the springwater trail; sometimes I'll see him way over in Sellwood--there are probably about eight bikers who I not only see every morning, but with whom I've also developed a sort of saying-good-morning-waving-and-smiling relationship. (That's about as much as you can get when you just zoom past each other in opposite directions, but even that fleeting contact makes the morning so much friendlier.)

A few weeks ago, one of these random saying-hi bikers actually motioned for me to stop. When I did and we both maneuvered our bikes to face each other, he told me ""I feel like I should know your name."" (I'm blowing over this now, but that totally made my week.) We introduced ourselves; since then, when we see each other and wave, he also says ""hi Stasia!"" and I say ""hi Michael!"" and thus the morning commute becomes even more personable. 

Now a quick aside: the last two days, I've brought my bike trailer to school so I could carry back whatever I need this summer. We're not going to have access to the school building because of some construction, so anything I could possibly anticipate wanting to work on this summer came home with me bundled in the bike trailer. I also brought home my rather large plants, both of which made the journey waving in the wind from the back of my bike (I got some great looks). 

So. Even though I pass the same people in the morning all the time, I don't really have the same rapport with people I see on the way home, because as much as my start time varies, my end time varies infinitely more. I leave school anywhere between 4:15 and some other obscene end times I won't name, so the people I see are always different. I also rarely see the same people that I see in the morning, I assume because most of them actually work regular 8-hour days. Regardless, for the last week or so, I've been seeing a few of the same people, including Michael. 

This morning, I almost missed him because I left pretty late. It's the last day, after all. But when we passed each other, he again motioned for me to stop, then apologized for doing so but said ""I just have to ask: what were you carrying in your trailer yesterday?"" We got to a bit of a chat, whereupon I learned that he works at PSU and commutes from a little past where I work. 

I guess the point of all this is that 1), I feel like this is the quintessential getting to know someone in installments. Sadly, now that I have no obligation to go to work for the next, oh, two and a half months (yes! yes! yes!) I am going to miss the next several installments of getting to know Michael, but maybe he'll still be there when I come back. 2), this is what I always hope for when I'm biking. It's so much friendlier on a bike--closer and more conversational than your closed-off little car world--but I still find that I don't really end up meeting people on bikes as much as just having glancing conversations with them. Or shared smiles that, granted, make the day much nicer, but in the fleeting kind of way that can also be kind of depressing when you get home and can't get in touch with anyone to go have a spontaneous cone of ice cream with you, for example. But the consistent commute gives me the opportunity through repetition to build up a collection of those little nice smiles or glances or exchanges, and perhaps the repetition over time can become something..well, probably not on par with random ice cream friends, but definitely more substantial, something you can count on in the morning."

(If not, you can find it here: http://ramblyness.livejournal.com/34333.html. By the way, does anyone know how to make links in livejournal more elegant?)

Anyway, I found myself in the position today of consoling him about his class having lost the big reading log contest of the trimester (this contest was a BIG deal for my 4th and 5th periods). He's turned in every single reading log, you see--reading logs are basically the only regular homework I give; kids have to read for 15 minutes a night and log what they've read), and he was sad that even though he tried so hard to get all his logs in as well as make sure his classmates got theirs in, 4th period still finally had a higher percent total of completed reading logs for the trimester. Interestingly, I found myself looking this fellow in the eye--keep in mind that he'd come to my class AFTER SCHOOL, well after he had any sort of obligation to be there--and totally truthfully saying that he'd done a great job this trimester. Not only that, but that a lot of his classmates have much better grades than they otherwise would have simply because of his insistent prompting that they, like he, turn in their homework.

Quite the change from him saying he was going to kill me, huh? This little guy has taken a (usually) positive leadership role in my class, has been (mostly) on task, has been worried about his grade, has personally turned in all his assignments not to my turn-in basket but directly to my hand, all proud but pretending not to be, and has raised his grade from a really low D to an A-. 

What happened? Honestly, I'm not totally sure. My vice principal helped me out by taking him out of my class for about a week, during which time I gave him all sorts of work so that he could not only catch up but actually get ahead. Then, when he came back, I made a big deal about how he was ahead of all his classmates and that he would have to help them since he was the expert now. And somehow, that was what it took for him to realize he COULD do language arts. He came back to a group of slackers, and he somehow got them to complete their project, with him at the helm. He came back ahead and then stayed on top of his work. He complained about it bitterly, of course, but since then, I really have gotten every assignment from him, directly into my hand. If I forget to ask for it, he gives it to me. He was even, as one sub put it, the ""rock star"" of the day, staying on task and getting his work done in an otherwise crazy class. (You can bet I gave him crazy positive public recognition for that one:) 

He's still a little punk, of course (today he was having a grand old time trying to turn my TV on and off while I was trying to read aloud to my class), and he still has his obnoxious moments, and he still doesn't like to read, but damn. He made it somehow. My role in that is ambiguous and fuzzy, but damn. He gives me hope for all the little punks I'll encounter. Somewhere in there, they all want to do well and be recognized; I just have to figure out how to find a spot for them to shine and they will."

But here it is, 7 instructional days left. Two of them--or maybe more; the fact that I'm not sure speaks volumes about how lax I've recently let my planning become--anyway, two of them, plus or minus, are shortened schedules. So approximately five real days and two short days of teaching left. Then one day of yearbook signing, one 8th grade celebration day at Oaks Park, one work day to check out (I'm still not sure exactly what a teacherly check-out requires), and then.... summer, glorious summer. 

I am so stoked about summer. 

How do you guys with normal jobs stand it? Not only do summers give you something to look forward to, a definite end to a period of work, but they also totally mark the passage of time. At least for me, summers are what separate one year from another--you know it's another year because it's the end of another summer. It's a very education-centric view of the world, I know, but having been in the education system since being, oh, about 5 years old, it's what makes sense. Do the rest of you guys count new yearses? Or does it all blend into one long, inseparable blob of time? I mean, I know that most of the working world does not, in fact, have a summer vacation of any sort, but even with the knowledge that I'm in the minority, the majority seems so foreign to me. How do you just keep working, day after day, with no end (save retirement, a long ways off) in sight? It seems so bleak.

Anyway. A year's worth of teaching in a nutshell: pretty damn good. I mean, I'm unnaturally biased right now because I can practically taste summer (so of course anything seems good), but even the objective results would be, I think, pretty damn good. The days where I desperately wanted to quit and become a mail carrier (I passed a courier almost every day on the way to school, and often envied what I perceived to be his extreme lack of responsibility and ability to go home at night not thinking about his job)--anyway, those days were very much outnumbered by the days where I went home thinking this is eventually going to be the best job ever. 7th graders are awesome, teaching is awesome; I'm not really good at it yet, but I think I can be. 

7th graders are also punks, of course, and teaching is tiring, and all-consuming, and I often come home at night feeling like I've given away every piece of myself, but I think that's what I love: chunks of me are in each of my students, whether they will ever be consciously aware of it or not. And maybe someday, those chunks will be what a student pulls out, dusts off, and realizes was important all along. Or maybe they'll always hate Language Arts, remember me as the teacher who sent them to the office for some horrible injustice (it was HIS fault, not mine!), and will never willingly read another word in their lives. Who knows. But somehow, that's satisfying to me too. These kids don't realize it now, but everything they do is shaping their world, and even the small, slippery, unpredictable chance to play a positive role in that is precious to me. 

So I'm stoked about summer, stoked about teaching, and very much excited to get better and better. Life is good."

I always tell my students just to keep writing, even if they have no idea what they're saying, keep writing as fast as they can, because eventually they'll stumble upon what it is that needs to be said. Virginia Woolf called it something like ""outrunning the internal censor"" (I'm horribly misquoting that, but it's the right idea)--the faster you write, the more you can keep ahead of your rational brain that tells you that what you're writing isn't good enough, and the more you'll surprise yourself by saying. Of course, not all of it will be good, and not all of it will have been worth the effort, but somewhere in there you'll find your gem. I'm taking the same approach here. I don't know what it is, exactly, that I need to say, but I know it's in here somewhere.

There are a few things I've been thinking about recently that are not necessarily related. First of all, and I don't know how to put a name to this exactly, is that I'm rather sickened by people's behavior on the internet. What I hate most about online interaction is that more and more, it absolves you of having to think about the effect you're having on other people. If you're having a conversation with someone, face to face--even on the phone--and they say something that you don't agree with, you have a few options. If you're invested in your relationship with them, you might try to get them to realize that what they said is ridiculous, or at least give them a different perspective and let them weigh it out. If you're not invested in your relationship, you could just let it slide. If you're a particular breed of asshole, you might tell them they're dumb and leave it at that. But no matter what path you choose, you have to live with your choice. You have to see (or hear) their reaction to your words; you have to see their facial reaction; you immediately get feedback on how your relationship to them will continue or not. 

Online, on the other hand, you get no such feedback. You can post something on a random blog, know that people will see it, and also know--especially if you post anonymously--that you will never be held accountable for what you say. You can say ridiculous, hurtful bullshit and never have to see someone crying about it. You can pretend to be someone you're not, you can make horrible jokes about killing babies and kicking puppies, you can be the most insensitive asshole imaginable; eventually, perhaps, you convince yourself that you're somehow doing the world a favor by ""telling it like it is."" The problem is that there's no outside check to remind you that you're dealing with real people, with real emotions, who are probably doing things for what they think are good reasons, even if you're not sure what those reasons are. Online, no one ever looks you in the eye and reminds you to be a decent human being. Online, the short, snippy, sarcastic, hopelessly cynical comment is king, and it's easy to forget that every time you make a snarky comment like that, you're impacting an audience much larger than yourself. You're contributing to a world where those kinds of comments are acceptable, where it's okay to just dash off a snap judgment--often hurtful--without putting real thought into what you're saying or how it's going to effect someone else. 

Don't get me wrong. I like the internet. I like being able to talk to/read about/hear from people I might not otherwise, and in lazy moments I even like that I can, say, read someone's blog instead of talking to them (though let's not get too used to that one, okay?:). I just hate the idea that the internet can stand in for real thought and real interaction--mostly, I hate that it can absolve you of accountability. I hate how easy it becomes to have no responsibility for what you're saying, and I hate how it just <i>feeds</i> cynicism and heartlessness. 

Hm. Clearly this internet stuff is my gem of the evening. Please be nice to each other out there, guys. We're all human, you know? Don't let the mask you can so easily wear on the internet convince you otherwise."

"event","It <i>is</i> possible to get to the airport, with luggage, using absolutely no fossil fuel or even power except your own muscles: when James left for his 10-day trip to LA and then Boston today, we decided that rather than take the bus and the light rail to get to his flight, we would take our bikes. 

Yep, a bike trip to the airport. It was actually a rather pleasant ride, and only took about 45 minutes--less time, actually, than it would have taken to ride the bus. And despite a few wrong turns (and the fact that the street it looked like we needed to take at the end also seemed to be a semi-major freeway), it was fairly straightforward, complete with a bike path through the airport-destined streets. (It also helped that today was the most summery day we've seen in Portland thus far--even now, at midnight, I have my front door and windows open.)

I guess I'm pleased about this for several reasons. First, I like the idea that even something like going to the airport can be divorced from a dependency on fuel-driven transportation. Since both James and I have thus far made the decision to lead a car-free lifestyle, it feels good to extend that to a trip that otherwise might involve a flexcar (zipcar now, I guess) or a bus. It's also sweet to discover that biking to the airport is actually not that much more of a time investment. Sure, a car would only take about 25 minutes, but the extra 20 minutes don't seem like that much when you take into account that you're leaving absolutely no carbon footprint, you're not paying anything in transportation costs, not even the relatively paltry $2.05 it takes to ride the bus, you're not buying into an industry you don't support, AND, on top of all of that, you're getting a pretty sweet workout too (especially if you're the one carrying the bike trailer:) It's not even that hard, logistically speaking: James' suitcase fit handily into my bike trailer, we locked his bike up at the airport (they have really nice bike parking there, actually), and then I biked home with the stuff he didn't want to leave on his bike for 10 days (namely, his lights, bike pump, and helmet). 

Of course, if we're ever both leaving at the same time, it'll be a little more complicated. We'd have to pack pretty lightly to fit enough stuff for both of us into the trailer, and we'd end up taking all the bike lights, helmets, etc with us onto the plane if we didn't want to leave them unattended on our bikes while we were gone. I'd also have to figure out a way to adequately lock the trailer up, because as it is it's latched onto my bike in a very stealable fashion. However, I'm pretty stoked to try it out next time either or both of us go on a trip. A day of air travel always leaves me so lethargic and sluggish-feeling; getting in a nice ride beforehand seems like a great way to mitigate that feeling. 

And hey, any excuse for a bike ride, right?:)"

"event","Books, man. They get me every time. 

..Actually, that's not true....eh, actually, maybe it is. I was about to say that it's been a while since a book has really grabbed me--I mean in the sense that I really don't feel like my reality is the same while I'm reading it--but then I remembered that the almost-last book I read (<i>I Know This Much is True</i>) did that too. And so did <i>Beloved</i>, which I read not that long ago. So I guess it's just par for the course that I feel so...taken, I guess...by a book.

I can't even describe it. All I know is that I just half an hour ago or so finished <i>The Pretties</i> (which, by the way, though don't tell anyone, totally made me cry), and when I called James right afterward I had a weird moment where I felt like I was talking to someone millions of miles away, because I'd been so much a part of the book for the last hour or so I'd been reading it. It was like real life was just an illusion, because the story had become so real to me. I don't know.  

It's just a very weird feeling, like my very emotions have been trifled with and even though I know it's from reading a book I'm virtually powerless to fix it. Like right now, I still feel unstable. I got so wrapped up in what was going on, and so taken in by the frustrations and powerlessness of the main character and how much she just wants to do what's right and is thwarted at every turn--and even now it's making me teary because I'm so frustrated by it! See? This is ridiculous! 

It makes me think of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>--you know, the whole idea of banning books because they make people sad, or confused, or uncomfortable, or anything else that's potentially volatile. I guess it's a relief that I can still get that way from books, despite however ridiculously weepy it makes me. Somehow, it makes me feel like I didn't lose that childhood wonder wrought of really sinking into a good story, of really empathizing with someone else, even someone fictional, to the point of making their frustratingly human experiences your own. Even through all the analyzing and deconstructing and rational thought we learn to apply to stories, the fundamental part of it--the part where you take the story and it becomes part of you--shines through. Thank god that that part still exists.

"event","About a month ago I got a traffic ticket for running a stop sign. Leaving aside all the complaints and why it was totally ridiculous, the pragmatic effect is that tonight, I spent two hours at a share-the-road safety class. An interesting conglomerate of cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians brought together by their separate legal infractions, this class was united by the fact that most people there, it seemed, were extremely disgruntled about their tickets. 

That's understandable, of course, since it also seemed like most people there were victims of traffic stakeouts--you know, where a cop parks at an intersection and just waits for people to break the law, those suckers. Anyone who gets a ticket like that is going to feel preyed upon, even if they were legitimately breaking the law. When it feels like someone was just waiting to pounce on your mistake, of course you're going to feel a little put out--especially when it's the justice system, the thing that's supposed to protect you, that's being represented in that stakeout. It sucks to feel like the institution that's purportedly for your benefit has just been lurking around the corner waiting for you to do something wrong. The legal system turned predator. 

But then again--and maybe I'm just getting feisty here, having paid $30 for the privilege of sitting in a cramped, poorly-lit auditorium to listen to an assortment of judge, cop, trauma nurse, pedestrian safety advocate, etc etc talk at me--isn't our legal system as it stands sort of a predator? I mean, fundamentally laws are supposed to give us order, society, the capacity to coexist peacefully, but when you introduce punitive measures (especially those that aren't even logical consequences) for people who break the law, and then wait around to punish them (and let's not even get into the fact that minorities and poor people will be punished more often and more heavily), it does start to seem a little predatory, doesn't it? 

Yes, the punishment for a crime is supposed to be the deterrent, to make people want to follow the laws so as to avoid the consequences, but when we <i>invent</i> consequences like paying $242 when you run a stop sign, or $97 if you jaywalk, when those consequences have nothing at all to do with the logical result of your crime (though paying to make everything okay does fit in nicely to a society that values money so much, huh?), it starts to seem a little ridiculous. Or like there's no reason to follow the law except that if you don't you have to pay--and then does that make rich people, for whom paying isn't as big of a deal, less accountable to the law because they have more capacity to ""right"" things (i.e. pay a fine) when they get caught? 

It seems like as things are now, yes. For reference, just look at any company that chooses to pay a fine rather than cut their illegal emissions, for example, because it's cheaper to be fined than to comply with the law. Or look at any rich person who can hire the expensive lawyer to help them talk their way out of whatever mess they're in in the first place. Or look at me, who has a relatively luxurious schedule that allows me the time to go to a traffic safety class that's only $30 rather than the $242 that the ticket would be otherwise. It sucks that the more money/time/resources you have, the less the legal system impacts you--because it's not based on doing what's right but on doing what's prescribed and given a dollar value. 

Anyway. I and about 100 other people are stuffed now with 2 hours worth of information about how to follow the laws of the land--and what made me laugh is that as I left, I was following another biker, also coming out of the class, who immediately ran the first stop sign we got to. I don't know if it was willful disobedience or just old habits, but I guess even the potential punishment AND the class rationalizing the potential punishment aren't enough to make coming to a complete stop at a stop sign when there's no one else around seem like a logical thing to do."

So to make the story short, he was basically pissed off that I made him do something that he didn't want to do,  made stupid jokes about killing Ms. Honnold, which is a very him thing to do, and thus got suspended for a few days. It's been very peaceful without him.

Two of my other students have been suspended this last week as well, prompting Alex to ask me today how many of them I thought would ultimately end up in jail. I'm not sure, but I can, sadly, definitely see cuffs in many of their futures.

"event","As my brother drove his van (his home, that is) across Utah, I sat on my living room floor grading makeup work--and like every time I talk to him, I started wondering why I'm not living the kind of life he is. That fool has got it made. Ever since my dad died, he's has a reliable source of income (life insurance payments) that has been more than enough to support his climbing--even more so now that he's picked up some corporate sponsors (North Face, namely) that provide him with any gear he needs as well as a travel stipend to help him pay for his gas, all as long as he keeps on climbing. Every time I talk to him he's somewhere new--today on his way to Moab, often somewhere on the way to or from Yosemite, sometimes in Colorado, sometimes near Las Vegas, and on and on--doing new and exciting things, testing his strength and endurance, seeing the world (well, the country, anyway), basically going wherever his whimsy takes him, on no one's schedule but his own. 

Whenever I talk to him, I wonder what led us both to take such different paths. I have the same life insurance investments that he does; I too could have bought a van and spent my days hiking, biking, running (no, I wouldn't climb like him, no matter how similar our circumstances;), seeing all the overlooked and remote places that my daily existence in Portland precludes. I too could be paying only for gas and food; I could be stopping in to see my relatives in Idaho on a whim; I could be spending the winter nights huddled in my sleeping bag(s) in the back of my van. Or maybe I could be living in Boulder for a while with some friends I met out there, having conversations about the last book I read. I could be sneaking into hotel pools when I needed a shower, ""poaching"" hot tubs that have easy latches to open. I could be, in short, living away from the daily work world, the scheduled world, the in many ways constraining world, the world of pavement and buildings and stores and clocks and expectations and responsibilities, both self- and other- imposed. 

How did I become so conventional? I think this is what's been nagging at me lately. I feel like I'm skating over the top of existence, that I've been really good at making it from day to day in this routine lifestyle of mine, but that I'm not really getting anything deeper. I have a really hard time explaining this. It's like what I was telling James tonight: I feel like I've lost touch with really experiencing, like I'm going through all the right motions but I'm not living, not really, not in the vital, raw, touching life way I want right now. Sure, I have great days and lovely moments and intense personal connections and THANK GOD for my bike ride to and from school every day so I hear the birds and feel the spring come, but somehow I feel like it's not enough. It might be a grass-is-greener kind of problem. It's never enough as long as I'm constrained by something (work, responsibilities, house payments (heh--how middle-aged do I sound?;), but if I suddenly had no constraints I'd probably find that it wasn't all I thought it would be, either.  I don't know. I just feel like something is missing right now, and I'm not sure what it is. I just know that when I talk to Alex, I'm insanely jealous of his devil-may-care lifestyle, that he's actually making it work. I feel like he'll look back and have all these great experiences in life; when I look back, I'm not sure what I'm going to remember. 

That sounds depressing, doesn't it? heh. It's not really that bad. I like where I am (and DAMN is it going to be sweet to have a summer vacation that I get PAID for), I love Portland, I love James, I love our house, I think I'll get better at teaching and will love that too when it's less stressful; I think I'm just feeling the wanderlust I get every once in a while. Last time a trip to Tahoe with my bike helped me work it out. Maybe this time I'll do something epic for spring break. Or summer, as far away as that sounds right now. The scope of my world--probably about a 20-mile radius around Portland, or occasionally farther if I take an epic ride--feels too small to me right now, and talking to my brother only highlights that. It's time to get out, really out, I'm just not sure when or how."

"event","This morning in my reading advisory class--basically a class for students who have been identified, via various and sundry test scores, to be at least a year behind reading grade level--I found myself in the somewhat awkward position of explaining what an orgasm was. It all started with an passage about biomes, totally devoid of anything sexual. We were reading all about the different kinds of things that live in the tundra (or something. To be honest, I was having a hard time paying attention to it myself), and one of my students was reading along at a pretty good clip when I realized ""did she just say orgasm back there?"" I didn't, of course, remember anything about orgasms in this passage, but I chose to ignore it. 

Then, though, a second girl was answering a question and I could have sworn that she too said something about an orgasm. At this point, I was starting to wonder if I was going a little bit crazy. Orgasms in the tundra? I stopped her and asked her to repeat what she'd just said, just to make sure, and she had, in fact, made reference to the many different orgasms in the tundra. It was then that I realized that they were reading ""orgasm"" when they saw the actual word ""organism."" 

I wrote both the words on the overhead: organism and, underneath it, orgasm. We read them both out loud, syllable by syllable.

""Okay guys,"" I said, ""an orgaNISM (repeat after me, orgaNISM) is something that's alive, like a human or a plant or another kind of animal. Now, do you know what an orGASM is?"" (at this point, much to my horror, the teacher from across the hall walked in with a student who she was putting in time out in my room. She gave me a funny look, but I was already into it so forged boldly on ahead.) Surprisingly, not one of them knew. They made some cute guesses (""isn't it something like being happy?"" ""wait, it has to do with climate, right? [huh?]""), but in the end I had to tell them. 

""Well, guys, an orgasm is what usually happens when two people have sex. Sometimes people call it the climax, because it's usually the most intense part,"" I said, or something along those lines. 

They all made the ""eeeeeeeew!"" sound that 7th graders are so good at. ""I would rather have learned that in health class!"" one of them exclaimed. 

""True,"" I said, ""but you wouldn't want to be embarrassed by talking about orgasms in your science class when you meant organisms, right?""

Funnily enough, this is actually not the first (or the second, for that matter) sexually-related question I've had to answer. One of my students once asked me what a condom was, and I think was way beyond shocked that I gave him a straight answer (""actually, it's something you put over your penis when you're having sex to help prevent pregnancy""). Another student once asked how people got AIDS. I've also had to matter-of-factly dispel the myth that every gay person in the world is just having sex with other gay people, continuously, and certainly with a lisp, for every second of their existence. And we've also had rather unforseen discussions about the difference between a gay man and a transvestite. (Being gay doesn't mean that you necessarily wear womens' clothes [oddly enough, I don't think my students--most of them, anyway--have even thought about women being gay]). 

These are not the kinds of questions I necessarily thought I would be answering when I signed up to teach language arts, but it's actually  kind of fun for me. I like making things that these kids think are so taboo into totally normal, matter-of-fact conversational topics. I like unflappably approaching the idea of being gay, an idea that they (and this annoys me to no end) find hideous and laughable. I like talking about my awesome gay friends and shocking my student with my openness about and acceptance of their attraction to the same sex. I hope I'm scandalizing some of them out of their bigoted comfort level; I hope I'm letting others feel that they don't have to be like everyone else to be considered normal.  

We'll see how long it takes until someone's parent complains that I'm teaching them about condoms and what orgasms are. In the meantime, bring on the uncomfortable conversations!:)"

I've been proceeding as if I were in this job to teach them English. And yes, my job description is a Language Arts teacher, but it's not English for the sake of English that these students need. I'm not even convinced right now that English for the sake of being able to read and write is what they need--at least, not all they need. 

These students--many of them anyway, I can't say this is true of all of them, but a huge majority--don't even know they have options in life. They don't know that English, that being able to communicate, that being able to express themselves, is something that can get them out of where they are now. They don't know what it means to be really respected and taken seriously for more than just their ability to entertain. They don't realize how goddamn <i>unfair</i> it is that they're here, at school, getting their government-sponsored lunches and breakfasts while their parents (or parent, singular, or aunt, or whatever family member can take care of them at any given time, or whatever family member isn't in jail) work their dead-end jobs and come home way too late to do anything but go to sleep. My students don't know that it doesn't have to be like that. 

And how do I convince them? Possibilities and opportunities and options are things that happen to other people, people who aren't like them, people who go to private schools, people whose parents come to parent/teacher conferences because they believe school is worthwhile, people who were just <i>born</i> that way. I am not doing enough for my students because I am not giving them what they need to see that they have a choice--because I don't know how to do it. I've been teaching personal narrative, but I haven't been helping them see that their words, their way of describing their world, has the power to change it. I've been teaching vocabulary and reading without helping them see that being able to read, to think, is halfway there. I need to be doing more. I need to figure out how to do it, and I need to make doing well in my class translate more effectively to doing well in the world. It's not enough so far. I need to do better--not for me, I mean, not because <i>I</i> need to do better, but because it's what they deserve."

"event","In a new experiment, I've taken to counting to five in my afternoon classes and then taking as much time as it takes them to get quiet after that away from their passing period--except that I found that if I count DOWN, they all count with me and then, with their mouths already in motion, continue talking after the countdown (mouths in motion remain so, apparently, thus proving that Newton's laws do in fact apply to 7th graders). But if I count UP to five, they'll be quiet when I get there. This is one of those random facets of humanity that you'd never know about unless you spent some time in a classroom (or anywhere else where you're surrounded by people who haven't yet learned to control themselves). A countdown apparently exists only as a transition to the following ""blastoff!"" or other appropriately bombastic conclusion, and to expect silence afterward is sheer lunacy. This is what I learn by teaching 7th grade.

That being said, I have a few countdowns of my own today. 

THREE days until I see my mom, who's coming up for a vegetarian Thanksgiving.
TWO days until Thanksgiving break.
ONE day until until a five-day break from my students. 

Most importantly, however, is the much longer countdown: 
THIRTY TWO days until, if all goes according to plan, James and I have a place of our own. That's right, our recent home offer was accepted today, and the woman we're buying it from plans to be out by the 21st of December. Of course, within that thirty-two day countdown, there are various other countdowns: ten days until we have to finish all the inspections we're going to make. Somewhere less than ten days to find insurance. Somewhere tentatively more than ten days but probably not really to make sure that all the money's in order. Thirty days until closing. Who knows what else is going to be necessary. The whole process seems hugely contingent upon meeting varying impending deadlines, which is probably why I'm in such a huge countdown mindset. The clock was set this morning at 10 when we found out she'd accepted our offer; now it's jump jump jump through all the hoops until December 21.

Yes, it does have a white picket fence. No, that does not mean I'm going to don a 50s apron, make dinner every night, and spawn the requisite 2.5 children. It <i>does</i>, however, nicely compliment the cheery kitchen and accompanying breakfast nook. I'm pretty stoked. 

So yeah, if there was ever a countdown that should be followed by an exuberant blastoff, I think this is it--if it all works out. Think us happy thoughts:)"

"event","This is the effect of daylight savings time, I suppose. I can only hope now that this early nighttime is made up for by an actually light morning when I bike to school for the next few weeks--that is, until the whole commuting process is swallowed up entirely by the wintery dark and wet. 

Anyway. That's neither here nor there, just a random tangent. The real thought of the evening is about family. Having just spent the last few days in Chicago with the near-entirety of James' mom's side of the family, all of whom (with the exception of his mom, of course) were new to me, I've been swimming in thoughts about family: the being born into vs. the being adopted by through the auspices of a romantic relationship.

I know it wasn't exactly, but this weekend seemed like a bit of an audition to me: is stasia good enough to be girlfriend to my son/nephew/cousin? Is she smart enough/funny enough/sweet enough/caring enough/into James enough/insert-any-quality-here enough to be part of this family? Will we think about her and James together and smile, or will we say snide things about her the way we joke about the girlfriend his uncle Dan had before he ultimately married his wife? It's not like the people I met this weekend have necessarily been a huge part of James' developmental life (I don't think he's seen most of them for eleven years or so), nor is their approval or rejection going to spell the success or doom of our relationship, but their opinion is still supremely important to me. And though I'm confident enough to think that they <i>should</i> like me, I'm not cocky enough to assume that they will. 

Oddly enough, I never thought about it being important that I like them. At one point, James and I were talking about my reticence to be part of the post-wedding family picture--how it could be taken as uncertainty on my part about wanting to be part of the family, how it seemed that I didn't yet consider myself a permanent enough fixture to insert myself into the long-term posterity that is a picture, especially one taken while everyone is in his or her suit and dress (post-wedding classy seems so serious. If we were all wearing jeans and hanging out after a rodeo or something maybe it wouldn't have been an issue). The fact that my shyness about being in family pictures could be taken as a statement about how seriously I felt about James makes sense to me, I guess, but I hadn't thought of it like that until he mentioned it. To me, it just seemed rather presumptuous to assume that I could be part of such a relatively important family photo. Yes, I plan to be part of the family, so to speak, for a long long while, but I never even thought about my own agency in that decision. To me, it seemed that this trip was about my being accepted, not about my being able to simply assume a place to which I felt I had a right. To get back to where I started, my own thoughts about his family never seemed important to me; it was only their thoughts about me that mattered. Funny how quickly I gave up my own agency. 

That being said, I did very much like his family and can only hope that they felt the same way about me. James is still with them for the next week; I hope they're filling his head with kind words about me:) Again, not that he needs them to convince him that I'm awesome, and not that I'm the central topic of conversation or anything, but it sure couldn't hurt if they liked me, right?"

I often wonder what it would be like to be hit by a car. That sounds morbid, but it's not really, not in my head. It's just one of those things that inevitably comes up when one bikes a lot and repeatedly hears about other bikers on similar streets being hit/killed by cars. I mean, I'm not planning on being hit, and I'm certainly not planning on being killed (how lame would that be?), but it's something by which I can always judge how excited about the future I am. If I think ""hey, at least if I were in the hospital I wouldn't have to face tomorrow at school,"" I know it's been a bad day. If I think ""bring it on car, there's no way in hell you're taking me down,"" I know I've still got some spunk in me. 

Today is a spunky day. 

II.
Tomorrow James and I make our first offer on our first home. Having never done this before, I don't really know what to expect, though if it's like the rest of the house-buying process thus far it will probably involve lots of jargon, lots of time, and our signatures on many identical-looking lines. We will also, in the span of only a few hours, certainly become about ten times as boring as we usually are. That seems to be the effect of house-buying thus far: exponentially increased boringness. I hope it's temporary, because with the increase of boringness I'm already suffering with this all-consuming teaching job, I don't know if I can handle the added boringness of house-buying without turning to stone. 

III.
November is National Novel Writing Month. Anyone want to write a novel with me? (It's quantity, not quality, that counts here). Check out the web page: http://www.nanowrimo.org. I think it'll be fun:)

IV.
It's perfect fall weather here recently: windy, sunny, and cold, with healthy bursts of swirling leaves. Yesterday, I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous I must have seemed as I tried to catch falling leaves from atop my bicycle. Today, I took the long long long way home and crunched oh-so-satisfyingly through all the little helicopters that fall from trees and litter my commute. Tonight, I am wrapped in a blanket in front of my fire, listening to the wind outside; this weekend, I will carve pumpkins and eat squash. I love fall."

"event","On Monday I turned in grades for progress reports. So today I had my students grade me, yknow, as a way to get some feedback about if they're actually learning anything, what they think about class, what could be better, all that good stuff. It was a pretty significant survey I gave them and only at the end did I ask what letter grade they would give me so far and why. The best response I've seen yet has been ""F- : Because your unaturaly cheary."" heh. I'm not sure what that means, exactly, but despite the F-, I figure it can't be that bad:)"

Every year, I make improvements on my ability to comfortably bike through the winter. A few years ago it was booties. Last year it was my reflective jacket and my affectionately named backpack condom (so as to make more hydrophobic my otherwise-hydrophilic Jansport). (Now that I think of it, maybe my reflective jacket was two years ago.) 
Anyway, this year I got a whole new backpack, totally waterproof. Check it out: http://www.ortlieb.de/_prod.php?lang=en&produkt=track

I'm pretty stoked about this. Now all I need is fenders and I'm going to be totally set! Bring on the winter rains!:)

(okay, fine, any normal person would have gotten the fenders FIRST. Let's just say it's really hard for me to unsexify my hot and sexy wants-to-be-racing-not-commuting bike like that.)"

"event","Awesome coworkers make the biggest difference in the world. I spent today--a professional development day for my district, which means, practically speaking, for those of us who did not take the opportunity to institutionally develop ourselves, a day off--I spent today in the Gorge with one of my fellow language arts teachers, hiking around the beautiful fall waterfalls. It was spectacular, for all the usual reasons: turning leaves, clean air, that amazing silence you get in nature, crisp, sparkling water, nothing but soft under my feet, no one else around... It was also spectacular for all of the intangible reasons that I'm having trouble describing right now. The net effect, though, is that I feel clean, awake, fresh, revitalized--both from the hiking and from the just-cemented-a-new-friendship feeling that comes from spending a day's worth of physical activity and conversation with someone you're just getting to know. 

I also finished reading <i>Jacob Have I Loved</i> and am well into the sequel to <i>Stargirl</i>. I'm determined to read as much as I possibly can this year, particularly from young adult authors, and I'm feeling pretty good about myself so far. Since school's started, I've read: <i>Stargirl</i>, <i>Loser</i>, <i>Jacob Have I Loved</i>, I've started and put aside <i>The Outsiders</i>, and, in a purely for myself novel, I reread <i>Beloved</i>. Oh, and I read <i> Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i>, but that was mostly cartoons and took like half an hour to finish. Admittedly, young adult novels read fast, but I'm still pretty impressed with myself. Somewhere between four and five books in a little over a month is not too shabby for a crazy-stressed first-year teacher, I think. 

Maybe one day I'll get back to what I snobbily consider real literature. You know, stuff that you can't read in 15-minute increments at the beginnings of each of your class periods. For now, though, I'm going to catch up on all the books I missed when I was in middle school and all the books that have been written for that age since then. I promised my students that my next book would be from the bulletin board of recommendations that we're developing between all my classes. Unfortunately, none of the books my students have recommended yet seem that interesting to me--but to be fair (I ask them to read stuff they don't want to, after all), I'm going to do it anyway. We'll see how it goes. For now, I'm cheating on them with the Stargirl sequel, but if I finish it this weekend, which I think I will, no one will know anyway:) 

I'm feeling good."

"event","There is no better way in to the 7th grade psyche than through notes taken from their clenched hands, from half-hidden under their reading books, from the floor when their throwing misfires. 

My favorite pilfered note so far has been this treatise on love and relationships. The first part goes as follows:

""Heyy what do you do when A guy doesn't like u? Do you stop likeing him or do you keep tryin till you think he likes u or does like u?""
""You should still try and like him but if he still does not like you then try and stop.""

Great, matter-of-fact advice, right? Keep on trying, but if it doesn't work out you should just stop liking him. If only we all had so much sense! I love a lot of things about this note, but mostly I love how easy it is, and how much sense it makes. There's no ""I don't know, it depends on the circumstances, where you are, where he is, etc etc."" There's just try a little, and then if it doesn't work, give up.

It seems like that was enough for the first person, too, since the note continues like this:

""OK thanks! Like he talks to me but I think he just doesn't like me! But I'll keep trying a little more but I don't like him that much I just think he's cute!:)""
""OK. I asked DJ out and he said NO!!""
""Woah I thought he liked u though?""
""Me too, but I guess not so anyway I can't wait till pe.""

I love this for so many reasons, but that PE bit is my favorite part. Trouble in love? Just go run it off:)"

"event","Ah, the seating chart: a total logistical nightmare. It's not enough to simply know that Bryan and Todd need to sit in the front so you can keep an eye on them; you also have to take into account that Bryan can't sit near Breanna because they already had a counseling intervention, can't be too near Jake because they'll never stop talking, and Jake himself also needs to sit in the front but probably needs a cushion of really well-behaved girls around him to keep him in line. Not Julie, though, because she has a crush on him and won't concentrate if she's near him. Sean, who's pretty well behaved otherwise, can't be behind Jake, in the meantime, because that will tempt him to the carefully-aimed spitwad catapulted toward the back of Jake's neck, though it inevitably hits Charlotte, poor Charlotte, who's the sweetest girl ever and who you keep putting by punks as part of that cushion of well-behaved girls. And on it goes. 

Needless to say, after having rearranged my classroom's desk formation this evening, I have spent an inordinate amount of time on seating charts which will, of course, inevitably fail one, two, ten, or even all of my students anyway. heh. At least it's another try though. We'll see how it goes.

In other news, I feel like I've become completely boring. Is this what happens when one joins the work force? One starts thinking of very little apart from one's job? A few days ago (weeks? I don't even know) I was trying to explain my experience of teaching so far, and it basically comes down to the fact that there is no way teaching is an 8-hour-a-day job for me right now. In those 8 hours allotted, let's say six of them are spent actually teaching (with a half hour for a lunch that is somehow never actually a break). Another hour is spent in meetings. So that's seven hours accounted for. The remaining hour, then, is time for me to: plan, grade, call parents, really look at how students are doing, take care of an administrative stuff, either relating to class or to school in general, and do such miscellaneous things as rearrange desks, make seating charts, come up with amazing behavioral incentives like student of the week (which will, of course, have to be thought about and planned), and otherwise take care of everything else that goes into the six hours of teaching and one hour of meetings that will happen tomorrow. 

This is why I am boring. My entire life, currently, has become swallowed by seventh grade. And here I am writing about it more, just in case you were unconvinced that this is really all that I actually think about:)

Oddly enough, I'm feeling pretty good about it right now. It's been a long day, but I got a lot done. And I'm going to get better at this. Just wait."

"event","Yesterday, I woke up way too early, in tears, to haul myself off to a doctor's appointment, then to a planning meeting with the two other seventh grade teachers and our administrator, then over to school to grade a shit-ton of student journals. A working Saturday might have been okay, of course, except that I'd already been at school for a good almost-eleven hours the day before. And it might have been okay except that Friday afternoon--probably six hours into my 11-hour stint--had been quite possibly the worst afternoon yet of my two weeks of teaching. I'd biked home thinking there was no way I was every going to be able to do this, and I woke up not to a badly-needed weekend but to more planning, more grading, more school, more reminder that I'm signing my life away to seventh graders. 

So what does this have to do with being lucky? 

It comes from people. From James holding me on Saturday morning, letting me cry, and reminding me that I can do this. From the other two 7th-grade teachers, also new, who are just as crazy as me right now and just as adamant that we're going to do things right. From my vice principal, who gave up her Saturday to help us out. From my new roommate, whose crazy social-work job reminds me that there's a reason I'm trying to help even the punkiest of 7th-grade punks get an education and understand that their actions have consequences. 

My luck comes from BJ and Aimee, two too-long-neglected friends, calling to say hi and invite me to a game night. From seeing BJ biking the other direction and waving wildly across the street to him, huge grin breaking out across both of our faces. From my brother, who's doing his first triathlon today and whose phone call yesterday salvaged my afternoon. From the man at the farmer's market who perpetually asks ""like poetry?"" and who gave me a poem today when I said that yes, indeed I do. From those of you, near and far, who check in with me every once in a while and let me know I'm still in your thoughts. 

Thank you, thank you, thank you. Despite the crazy of my last two weeks, you make me the luckiest stasia in the world."

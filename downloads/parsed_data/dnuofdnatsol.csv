"event","Hey guys! So I have not updated in a very long time....I guess you could say a lot of things have happened. Some bad, more good though. I think things might be getting back to the norm a little bit. 

Last weekend was the Halloween party filled with great friends and fun....oh yeah and we cant forget the booze, essential for every great bash. I had a really great time I met a few new people and caught up with some other people. 

This week was really cool.....Wednsday I hung out with Jasshole I missed her.....a lot...we did the norm went to G.Cizzle and had a grilled chee and talked for an hour or so. Thursday was nice too, Danielle and I worked and then hung out later in the evening.....I missed her as well. 

Last night was a crazy one at the cuzzies house, everyone was there. I polished off 8 beers in 3 hours, needless to say I was pretty friendly. Right now I am at work running on god knows how many hours of sleep and I am pretty sure Im still fractured a little bit. Thank god I dont have a hangover though...

I was thinking about school and stuff the other day and I really think I want to go into Photography. I really want to explore the world and I think Doing it with a camera in my hand would be the most awesome thing ever! I love taking pictures. I really might just do it I am sort of scared to leave and go other places besides home, but I think I might have to do it for myself.

Tonite is going to be fun, Alisha invited me on an adventure.

Post later.

"event","Well....Not much has happened since the last time. The past two weekends have been crazy drunken fun. two weekends ago I went to the Michigan game with my cousin and his girlfriend and her friend it was a good time we go drunk and painted our faces and had an awesomely fun time. St. Raphael's festival was after the game it was crazy there I always tend to forget the people I know when I go to gathering like that one, you just see so many people. 
   This past weekend was a blast, I stayed at Alisha's house with her for the weekend friday was a bonfire and saturday was great Danielle and Gen hung out with us and we went to the cuzzies house and got drunk and propositioned a few people. HA! Sunday was more or less of a chill day we just kicked it at Alisha's with a few people and smoked and watched ""Robin Williams: live on broadway"" it was fucking funny! then Alisha, Danielle, Jasshole and I went for a little driver and then we all headed home. 
   These good times never get old, keep em' rolling!
Well Im out smoke break time at school....lol peace

  Last weekend was a crazy one over at my cousins house. haha. Mel+ a pint of captin mo's= best stripper on earth. lol. Alisha....hahahha...you need to come over with me again ;-) get some. I cant wait until next weekend. 
  Yesterday I started school at Cambridge. woop. not. It isnt to bad but its a new ajustment. I sdont really have any friends In my classes but thats not really what Im here for so I guess its a good thing I just want to get this year over with and graduate. I do like how I only have 4 classes. smoke breaks, and I only go to school tuesday-friday. Its not to bad. I get off campus lunch to, which pretty much consists of Emily and I going out to buy smokes and then comming back to play hacky sac and smoke squares. lol. kinda lame yes I know but I think Im doing better for my self but going here this year. I am actually going to try and get my shit done and whatnot. 
  I looked into this really rad college for photography in chicago. I think I might want to go there. I would miss everyone so much if I went there tho I dont know I dont want that to hold me back tho. I have always like photography a lot so maybe I will just do it and make lots of money. that woul dbe extra cool. maybe I could end up being a radical famous photographer for like a big mag or like some fashion line. Ahhhh....wishful thinking. Well my bell is about to ring and I dont want to waste anymore time rambling on about stuff....peace."

I havent posted in a long while but I've been busy with a lot of things. Quite a few things have happened since I last posted. Work is slow but its picking up a little bit So its not as monotonous as it was before, Alisha and I are becoming a lot closer and hanging out more often. She understands me a lot more than anyone else I know. Lost my best friend, It seems she doesnt care anymore, or ever for that matter. Maybe we are just growing different ways, maybe one day we will be kosher again, but that day is not today. It sucks. My boyfriend and I are good I guess, not much to say about that. Afew of us are supposed to be heading up to Canada for a vacation in like 2 weeks it will be a good time. I cant wait. Last night Alisha had a party at her house it was fun as hell. Lauren and I went to the store to buy smokes and snacks and we got pulled over it was so crazy. Jeremy came over with fucker Sparrow and I was happy I havent seen them in a long time. I was completely fractured last night, I had a lot of brew....and paid for it this morning. I ended up going to Warped with Alisha, we had an awesome time. Met a Monk. Tommorow is Danielle's party congrats to her Im not sure if Im attending yet. Well I have to get back to work there are some funeral pieces that have to  go out.
Peace nigga."

Saturday night I was at my cousins like always and we were all having a great time so I decide that I have to go to the bathroom so I precede into the house and the baby gate was up so I try and get over it one leg no problem second leg big problem.....It got stuck on the gate and I when down and my leg stayed on the gate and twisted like never befor I had a Flamingo leg for 2.5. sick. Well It was dislocated. My knee cap was on the side of my leg sticking out about 2 inches.....So my cousin was like okay im gunna try and fix it well it didnt work I had to be rushed to the quacks at Garden City hospital.....They suck at life. They tried to put it back in without sadating me twice that didnt work because I screamed bloody murder so they gave me some goooooooood drugs and I went to sleep and woke up all better. Im on crutches and I have a big brace on. The past 4-5 days have been hectic with all the doctors appointments.....crazy....I think it might be a sign though for me to just chill for awhile. call me nuts but I think it is....why you ask? Well because every fucking person there that night tripped over that god damned gate and Im the only one who got hurt. Fuck. I really think its time for me to chillax for a bit. No more Pot or drinking for awhile. it will be hard but I can do it. Well Im off to get a new brace for my knee.....talk to everyone later. Pray for my leg! And thanks for all the help everyone has given me I looooove you guys! you know who you are!"

We chilled and drove around for awhile then we wnt to pick up this shnetler kid.....kinda weird. We walked out into the woods to this abandon houe and shit it as so fucking scary. I was wigging out. So then Tom and I dropped off schnet and P.T. and he came back to my house and chilled with me. We watched ""The day after tomorrow"" It was good. I <3 Jake Gyhllenhal. How cute. Im going to marry him. Tom left at like 1:00am And then I went to bed I was sleepy. Today mom and I went shopping and then out to eat at Olive garden I like that place its kinda good. I got Chicken marsala my favorite. And teramisu for dessert. Yumm. Yeah so Thursday night I came home at like 11:00 and my dad kinda got a little angry. So I cant use the truck this week.

"event","Hey guys havnt posted in awhile. Nothing really new going on in my life. tuesday my mom is going to finaly let me get my license. Thursday school starts. I started chatting with this rad kid from a band that I have seen a few times.

This weekend was really fun I had a blast, My parent were out of town again and I just chilled and enjoyed my company. NOT RICKY THOUGH! Fucker. Saturday Alisha, Vincer, Danielle, Travis and RIcky came over. We all just chilled and whatnot. Danielle and Trav stayed the night and in the morning we went out to breakfast.

Sunday Danielle ended up staying again. We chilled went to the gas station and were there for about a half hour lol! Uhhh then came home and cooked chicken and went hot tubbing.

Today Danielle and I chilled for a little bit and then she had to go to a birthday party for her little cuzzy so she peaced. And I have pretty much been sitting around all day. 

Sorry for the lame post.

"event","Hey guys! Its been awhile. I just got back from being in South haven with my dad's side of the family. I was bad ass! We had so much fucking fun and I was trashed like none other. 

Friday moring we left my dads at like 8 and got out the South haven by like 11 ish. So Michelle dad and I went to this little pleace to eat called Captin nemos ha! It was sooo tastey I had a blt wrap and it was sweet. When we got back from eating everyone else was there so it was starting to get fuck as hell. We couldnt get into our rooms until like 2 so My cousin Kevin and my anut and her husband and I went to the beer store and got a bunch of shit. I smoked 3 packs of smokes in two days. Wow, and not menthol for once! So when we got back Kevins room was ready so he got the key and We went down there and smoked. Ha! Beezer got  a lot of  shit and it was pretty much split up between him Kev my dad and I! lol. Friday night we all just partied it was Michelle's birthday ans she was trashed and puked I laughed at her. Ha! 

Saturday morning everyone woke up and went to breakfast and I was the only one who stayed behind and slept. I had a little bit of a hangover. opps. When they all got back I hoppped in the shower and got  ready and then My dad Michelle Dawn Kaylen and I went into town and went shopping and shit. Whenw e got back Grandma was there so the fun had to stop for a little bit. I was stoned the whole time she was there talking to me I couldnt say anything but ""Yeah gram thats cool"" and ""OoOh I see"". Yeah I was gone. So after everyone went to bed it was Kev Beezer Ryan and I and we got trashed again. Wow. We were gone for sure. Beez and I were the last two up and We just went down by the water and chilled for like 3 hours. It was cool. 

Well my dad was being an ass this morning he woke me up at like 6 and was like c'mon we are going soon get ready well I needed to take a shower but he decided for me that I wasnt. Thanks dad. Then we left like 10 mins after I woke up I was pissed I didnt really even get to say bye to my aunt and uncle from Chicago it sucked and Im pissed. I've been in a pissy mood all day today, just because we left so early which was pointless and then we went to some gay fucking town and walked around there. Oh well. 

I dont know why but for some reason I have been extreamly depressed lately I have had a lot of shit on my mind and Im stressin about it. I still havent got my license, I hate this All I want to do is get out and do something but I cant because Im a fucking dumbass. Oh well. Im a fuck up and right now I dont really care.

That is a very breif summery of my weekend trip. Cya later. Im lame."

"event","So for the past week I have been at Lee's house, we just chilled and shit. I love hanging out with her we always have so much fun. We played monopoly for like 6 hours one night and then the next day we played for like 2 hours. lol she kicked my ass both days. Then thursday we chillled with Lauren we ""drove"" around and then we stopped at Travis' house for the fire. Friday I went home.

So I get in the car when my mom picks me up and she is like we need to talk about your punishment. (for taking the car when they were gone) Well she was like your not going to be getting your license blah blah blah and I fucking bitched and complained and bitched some more and she is just being a joo about this. I dont know I guess it was the wrong thing to do and I guess I disurve to be punished for it but why the license! ahhh the horor. She wont tell me how long I have to wait either. I have a feeling its like a month. but hopefully she takes this grounding like any other and says out you cant do that and then like a hour later I ask if I can do it and shes like oh hells yeah. Oh well. 

I really didnt do anything productive last night I helped my mom a little bit they went out on their friends boat today so she had to make a bunch of food and shit to bring. I made the jello shots because Im a fucking champ at making them. Hells yeah! And then Frank needed to go to the store so I took him and then we went for a drive and listened to judas preist. lol it was fun we jammed. We went out to ridge and gyde and I took him on the ""hill"" lol he was like hurting himself trying to figure out an explination for it. I laughed. then I came home and watched ""Pulp fiction"" like one of my favorite moveies ever. Then I went to beddy bye.

Today is just gunna be a lame one. Ill just sit and chill and then most likely smoke. eh I dont know. Well Im out.

"event","Ok so this weekend was a good one. The parentals left on thursday night to go up to their annual canoe trip. So a few people came over.

Thursday night Alisha and Nessie came over and we just sat for a while until Trav, Danielle, Allan, Jay and Sara got there with ""the goods"". We ""hung out"" un til about 12 then everyone peaced. Nick was supposed to stop by but never did so I just fell asleep.

Friday my step-brother and I went to the store and then went for a little driver in the boonies. LoL. Then we came home took a nap and then I got ready Danielle, Alisha and I went shopping at the mall. Came back to my house and once again ""chilled"". Later on Mel and Heather stopped by and Danielle and I went skinny dippin in my hot tub. 

Saturday was a boring day....nobody came over till like 8ish I think and then they left at like 10. so I was online talking to Emily and she was bored too so I went and picked her up and we ""chilled"" went down to the neighbors party and then left because we were wigging out. Then later the cops came and we wigged even more.

Sunday we got up made BLT's and then took a nap and Em when home about 5. and the parentals arrived at about 5:30. and its been downhill ever since. I guess my step-dad looked at the miles on the truck before they left well apparently I put 55 miles on it while they were gone. opps. Oh well.

So that was my weekend. A VERY shortened version of it.

Bye bitches."

fuck me over stab me in the front 

Can I still see my future in your eyes,
or can I picture myself dead in your embrace 
And your cruel crimson red smile, kills 

Everyone cared about you. Why couldn't you 
Instead your greed compelled you to 
steal other silver linings. 

No one could have their moments 
free from your withering touch. 
Fuck off like you're the only person 
that has ever cried or been broken by love 
Spare me your pity party drunk off your own misfortunes 
Wallowing in your blissful melancholy 
can you taste my blood. 
You knew that this would kill me.
But you carried on and on 
with your selfish shit.

Everyone cared about you. Why couldn't you 
instead your greed compelled you to 
steal other silver linings. 

Burnt down my world, you killed my hope 
spread out the ash and walked away 
how could you just close off your eyes.
turn tail and run, you are the greatest coward 
damn right I am still pissed..
next time I see you we will see
who has the upper hand 
kiss me fist. 
Taste the floor. 
Tired of your games.

Well I called back and she didnt answer. I called Alisha and she didnt answer. I guess I have been ditched. Its not like them to do this maybe they are pissed at me or somehting. Im not really mad I just wish that they would have called so that I could have made other plans rather than waiting around for them. Oh well. Thats been my night. Peace until next time"

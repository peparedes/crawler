But I woke up today excited.&nbsp; Excited to have my own class to be able to put my knowledge and ideas to work.&nbsp; I want to see my classroom.&nbsp; I'm going to send an email to the school asking if I can visit.&nbsp; Now."

"event","I miss Morris and the people that are there.&nbsp; I keep thinking of asking for longer email updates or gtalk dates, but I think everyone's super busy.&nbsp; It's getting towards the end of the semester, which is hard to imagine.&nbsp; I've been so bad about mailing stuff...&nbsp; I'm having a good time but it hits me sometimes how much I'm missing.&nbsp; But at least it should work out to cancel my room in Spooner.&nbsp; Which was a ridiculous situation.&nbsp; They were going to charge me 800 dollars to cancel.&nbsp; In the beginning of april.&nbsp; When they still have plenty of time to fill the room.&nbsp; And technically I wasn't supposed to have been able to sign up online anyway, since I'm not a transfer student.&nbsp; Extortion.&nbsp; Someone had spent maybe half an hour reading my application and that of another girl, noticed that neither of us smoked and shoved us in the same room and sent us emails.&nbsp; Not worth 800 dollars of their time.&nbsp; But my dad got it down to half (which is 25% of only one semester which is as long as I was planning on staying anyway.&nbsp; you can't sign up for just one semester because they're ridiculous) and I think is still working on it.&nbsp; Which is good because I sure don't feel like dealing with it.&nbsp; So whether or not they still make me pay half it'll still be cheaper to move into the house off campus.&nbsp; Which I'm excited for because I never wanted to live on campus in the first place, I won't have to eat at food service every day, I'll be living with someone that should mean more motivation to actually hang out with MPIRG kids more often, and, best of all, I'll only be a block away from 306 E 7th.&nbsp; Well, now that I think about it, I forgot to factor in utilities and internet etc when I did the math to see if it would still be cheaper to live off campus even with the $390 cancellation fee, and it was only like $40 cheaper, so actually living will end up being more expensive.&nbsp; But I won't have to pay for a meal plan, so it should work out.&nbsp; 

It's weird to think of next semester.&nbsp; I am missing a meeting on Thursday for the ed program.&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; But I finally registered for classes.&nbsp; And have somewhere to sleep.&nbsp; I just need to make sure all my credits from here will transfer right.&nbsp; Which means I should probably try to get decent grades which means I should probably be reading right now...

"event","I haven't been able to make myself tell you guys yet, so here goes.&nbsp; My purse was stolen on Monday.&nbsp; The 10th.&nbsp; It was about as bad as it could have been, as far as what was taken, but about as good as it could have been otherwise.&nbsp; I was close to home and had luckily taken my phone out to look at it so I could call my host mom, who was luckily home.&nbsp; I was in no way physically threatened.&nbsp; Didn't even see it happen.&nbsp; My purse was under my chair.&nbsp; What an idiot!&nbsp; I'm usually so careful.&nbsp; But my camera and debit card were inside.&nbsp; I almost never carry either, but hadn't taken them out from the day before, on which day I decided to bring my camera and be a tourist for the day because I was going to San Telmo.&nbsp; I never got my pictures off my camera.&nbsp; I also had a necklace I'd bought as a gift inside and my precious little notebook that I take notes of random things that interest me in that I bought in Rome.&nbsp; It's all going to be fine.&nbsp; But I'm embarassed and bummed and it's generally a pain in the ass to get a card replaced.&nbsp; 

Since the shock wore off and I've gotten used to the idea of not having any money for a couple of weeks until I get a new debit card little things keep hitting me that I lost.&nbsp; A tube of burts bees.&nbsp; I told myself not to worry about the pair of shoes I was wearing one day because I always carry bandaids.&nbsp; Not anymore...&nbsp; A tiny, very useful bottle of contact solution.&nbsp; The email addresses of some people I met.&nbsp; A note from Brad.&nbsp; my physical coin purse and purse.&nbsp; I bought a new coin purse eventually but needed a new purse pretty much immediately so had to steal the one that I bought for Erin.&nbsp; Sorry Erin.&nbsp; I think you would have liked it, but it's mine now.&nbsp; A subway pass.&nbsp; some one peso coins (which are worth their weight in gold - no one likes giving change but you need coins to get on the bus).&nbsp; Stupid annoyances and things that the theives will have no or little use for.&nbsp; Damn.

But definitely don't feel the need to respond to this if you read it.&nbsp; I've gotten all the&nbsp; looks of pity and advices on how to avoid theft that I can take.&nbsp; It kills me that I know how to be really careful and how to hold my purse and everything but that I let my guard down once and it happened.&nbsp; I've also been told repeatedly that the main thing is that I'm okay.&nbsp; And also that it happens to everyone.&nbsp; I got a lot of stories from locals, too.&nbsp; Welcome to Argentina, they say."

"event","I was going to start a blog so I wouldn't have to start writing mass emails and people could just read about what I'm up to if they actually want to.&nbsp; I can't decide on what to call it though.&nbsp; It seems like an important part of having a blog.&nbsp; A clever name.&nbsp; Hmmm.

So I'm back on LJ.&nbsp; Which is a good place to be, but the audience (because I obviously need people to read what I write... oh dear) is very specific.&nbsp; But high quality.&nbsp; I will keep checking LJ to see what you guys are up to and maybe to write things that are specific to you and not to my family etc.

Who would want to post from their cell phone?&nbsp; Don't answer that.

I wonder if I'll get really insecure when I get home and no one on the street randomly compliments my appearance.&nbsp; 

The other day I was crossing a three lane one way street and a guy on a motorcycle started revving his engine loudly.&nbsp; I started walking quicker because I thought he was about to start moving, but there was actually at least half of the light left.&nbsp; He was revving it for me and made kissing noises.&nbsp; How ridiculous.&nbsp; But strangely satisfying every once in a while.&nbsp; It's true that people are more conscientious about their appearance here.&nbsp; Everyone always seems to be dressed up, though that's starting to seem normal.&nbsp; Even old ladies will wear low cut dresses and high heels around town.&nbsp; And way fewer people are out of shape, and when they are, it's nothing like here, but they don't exactly cover it up with baggy t-shirts.&nbsp; Everything is clingy at least in certain places.&nbsp; I bought some shirts yesterday.&nbsp; Definitely out of my normal style.&nbsp; 

And I bought one with completely ridiculous English on it.&nbsp; It makes me so happy.&nbsp; Bright yellow, with short sleeves and a hood that says: ""Learn my love and... kiss my future.""&nbsp; Ha."

Even though I have nowhere to go I feel trapped without a car at my disposal.&nbsp; If I was in Morris I could go anywhere.&nbsp; Here, at these temperatures, the only things in walking distance are cub and a holiday gas station (actually, two.&nbsp; how sick is that?).&nbsp; 

I've been forcing myself to not really think about visiting morris.&nbsp; Even as I discuss it and try to figure out my schedule.&nbsp; I can't afford to get that excited right now.&nbsp; Or to think about the fact that this visit will be the last time I see these people and this place in a good five or six months.&nbsp; Better to do mind-numbing searches on the internet."

"event","Media Services make me sad.&nbsp; And frustrated.&nbsp; And Angrrrrry!&nbsp; Rrrr.

And this computer won't let me paste what I wrote about this subject here because it's a mac and doesn't know how to control-v.
Dumb.&nbsp; Stuck in HFA...

Here's what I wrote before:
I'm writing because I'm stuck on campus with no homework on me.&nbsp; The one time I don't bring a book...

I'm getting fed up with Media Services on campus.&nbsp; They've always been helpful in the past when Mpirg has needed microphones or speakers etc, but this makes me reconsider my opinion about them.&nbsp; I had to videotape my math lesson.&nbsp; So I go to the media services office and stand there while the person working writes my information on the form, etc.&nbsp; I go to pick it up (there was confusion as to where it was supposed to be brought, for which I take a small amount of the responsibility), but it took me longer than I anticipated to find it, so I didn't double check to make sure everything was in the bag as it should have been.&nbsp; I had told them that I needed a digital camcorder, or a VHS but in that case I would have to be warned because I would need to bring a tape from home.&nbsp; I assumed that it was a digital one, since they didn't say anything.&nbsp; I got it to the school and had all of my stuff ready to go - camcorder set up, learning centers set up around the room, my notes in order and in the appropriate place, etc -&nbsp; when we realize there's no tape.&nbsp; The elementary school has no equipment of their own, not even a blank tape.&nbsp; So I have to pack up all of my stuff and postpone my lesson for a whole week.&nbsp; It's a good thing I wasn't planning on doing it at the last minute.&nbsp; So, even though I'm done with my hours and have work of my own to do, I stay and help the children make a craft, watch them sleep, administer snack, etc.&nbsp; And wasted 50miles worth of gas.&nbsp; So I go back to pick the stuff up to do the lesson this Monday (I had made sure there was no confusion.&nbsp; I ordered a digital recorder with a used tape).&nbsp; He wasn't going to give me a cord because he just put a new battery in, but I made him give me a cord and anything else I could possibly need.&nbsp; He didn't have a tape ready and couldn't find one until his boss luckily came in and got me one.&nbsp; The process took twice as long as it should have.&nbsp; When I got there the battery didn't seem to work, but we had the cord and everything seemed to go well.&nbsp; I got back, returned the equipment, and&nbsp; asked them to transfer the data from the little digital tap to a cd that I could actually play.&nbsp; I had been told that this would cost a dollar and not take very long.&nbsp; When I asked the person working there at the time, however, she had me put my information on a slip of scrap paper and put that on the desk with the tape because apparently they don't have work order request forms.&nbsp; She was pretty sure that would work.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; She said they would call when it was done.&nbsp; I didn't get a call, so I went in today around noon.&nbsp; The worker's boss was out for lunch and she couldn't find the disk anywhere so told me to come back later.&nbsp; I came back later.&nbsp; The boss isn't in because he's setting up for Jamboree, come back at four.&nbsp; So I'm waiting in the computer lab in the HFA, staring at not one but two computer screens.&nbsp; I'm not sure exactly what fancy programs they use down here that requires two monitors for one keyboard and tower.&nbsp; I bet you they either a)lost the tape, b)have the tape but didn't get to it and won't have time before they close to do it so I'll be dead out of luck (did I mention my analysis of this tape is due tomorrow?) or c) they've had it done since Tuesday morning and forgot to tell me so I'm all in a huff for nothing except that they lost the disc anyway...

Here's what I know now, a full fifty six minutes later:

They almost lost my tape.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp; I was getting a little frantic as they were looking for it and thought that they might have given it to someone else because it was used already.&nbsp; I'd have been so screwed.&nbsp; They eventually found it, but the&nbsp; guy hadn't seen it yet, so of&nbsp; course it wasn't done.&nbsp; He started doing it right then.&nbsp; Should be done at 5:15.&nbsp; So I'm stuck on campus for another fifty minutes or so with no homework.&nbsp; And I have so much to do...&nbsp; It's going to be a nasty night.&nbsp;"

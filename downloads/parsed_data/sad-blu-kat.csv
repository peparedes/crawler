"event","here is a poem I wrote... please tell me what you think.



Clenching to my sanity,
I am pulling again.

I can't seem to breathe anymore;
I have been choked out by my own dry tears.

I have vanished into a mere shadow of what once was,
and I apologize for everything.

""the thoughts"" have entered my mind again.
Like my existence, they haunt everything.

Lurking in a corner, are they,
I myself am cowering in you.

You pull away and I'm falling.
The depths, too deep to imagine.

Hands reach out for me pretending to offer safety,
but in turn, they pull me farther down.

Then I semi- wake to see the pit...
the pit that is ME.


~ Kat

"event","wow, so much has happened.  Let me first state the good.  I SAW AMY!!!!!  And she slept over!!!!!!!!!  We talked for hours abt all that had happened.  wow.  it was awesome. 
    Then I went to go see my therapist and she's putting me on meds.  That's right, anti- depressants.  I have a severe depression.  Unfortunately, my parents are acting like they are embarrassed to have me because they see themselves... or me... as a failure.  So this makes me feel even worse.  
The thing is, my parents don't believe I'm depressed... and why should they?  I mean, when I'm at home (the short countable minutes I'm not at Calla's) I put on an act so that they won't get all nosy and making me talk to them.  So my dad asks ""Well, Kate, we don't really see the depression so why don't you just let us read your notebook that Amy (the therapist) reads?""   Can you believe that??????  He wanted me to let them read my journal.  Holy shit that would be the end of the world!!!!!  I can't even comprehend how they would react and change their ways and get all weird around me if they knew the thoughts that I have and have told Amy (the therapist) about.  I mean, a couple of you that may read this will know what I mean when I say ""thoughts"".  
But anyways, ya, so my parents are against it, so I went and talked to Calla's mom (she is the BEST!!!)  She was supportive and all and wow, I often wish she was my mom, too.  (IN a way, she kinda is)  My parents will have to go in and talk to my therapist about it all, without telling them my inner most secrets.  
But all of this concludes that my parents seem embarrassed to have me as their own and like they can't or don't wantto deal with me.  errrrr (copyright 2004- all others, not Maura, are excluded and copying or illegal reprinting is punishable by...by...extreme hatred!!!  mauahahaha...except Gloria)   anyways, I need to go.  As usual, I'm going over to Calla's and we're going to clean.  Her mom always tries to pay me, but I resist, then she gets mad so for the rest of the time I try to sneak it back in.  haha!  Hope everyone's summer is going well.  I bet this entry and its contents surprised you as they surprised me!"

I hurt everywhere, and can't breathe well through my mouth, and my nose is too blocked up to even attempt.  I drink so much water, but within minutes my throat is drier than ever.  I cough and cough, it never ends.
    I'm also really pissed off about a lot of things.  But I can't write it, people would take it the wrong way, maybe because it is wrong.  People are just annoying and all.  And I'm not going to say it, but I feel it.  If I say it, everyone will say the same things over and over again.  So fuck the world.  I'm not going to think anymore.

"event","my frigin parents locked me and Erica out of the house.  She slept over and all, and then we went and had fun.  but of course my mom had to complain about my supposed attitude.  So then I ask if she can sleep over again, and they say maybe.  Erica and I go down to the Morgan Park at Indian Lake, and we hadf to wait fucking 65 minutes.  Then we finally get in their and lose the ball and hit 3 cars with it (by accident) and then we totally crapped out and walked home.  Just as we get to the street I live off of, my parents pull up and I ask if she can sleep over.  they're all ""NO!""  and drive off.  We were hot, tired, and kinda pissed off about everything when we come to find out that we are locked out and then we try the front door, and it too is locked!!  So we stand there, swearing our brains out when we come to the conclusion to go through the garage.  After 5 minutes of getting it open, we get to the top of the dark basement stairs to find out that it, too, is locked!!!  So we sit there, ready to kill people, when Erica gets the great idea to reach through the cat door and unlock it, but she couldn't find it, so then I try and finall we get it.  Fucking parents.  I'm so pissed, this is not a self- pity thing, either.  So we just got in now and they still aren't home yet.  I'm so fucking pissed, but as always, it will be my fucking fault."

"event","nothing ever matters or ever will.  I am so low right now, so depressed, so upset with myself.  No matter what I do I will never amount to anything.  Everyone loves each other, and I am just a mere bystander.  Everyone is so happy to have everyone else, but no one really cares about the loser standing in the corner with her hair (that she'll just eventually pull) covering her glasses.  No matter what I do, I will never become one of everyone else.  I will never be the one that they go to talk about THEIR problems to.  They will always see me as the mental case.  
And I""m crying now because I'm sick of being no one.  I'm so tired of being myself.  I'm so annoyed with not being trusted enough and thought of enough for people to be able to confide in me.  It's one thing to be able to confide IN people, but it's so much better to be loved enough to have people confide in you.  No one has ever confided in me, except Amy, but look at how that turned out.  
I just want to be loved, to be someone's favorite, and now I feel a billion times worse because I just sounded so self- centered, so rude, and now I see why no one wants to be trusting in me.

And I mean, I'm pretty much done with pulling, except at night or when i'm bored.&nbsp; </P>
<P>and last night I just signed off without saying goodbye to Maura and that made me feel even more sorry!&nbsp; And lately I feel so sorry about everything that I do and I just want to take back all that I've done and said.&nbsp; I mean, I really feel like I'm a big burden on everyone and I just don't want to be that anymore.&nbsp; I mean, I don't want to be a burden or have people think that I'm an attention hoard.&nbsp; I just wanna be normal.&nbsp; But it's too late for that, and I'm so sorry.&nbsp; Like, why can't I be okay with myself and not always feel so damn bad?&nbsp; I just want to escape it.&nbsp; I'm not writing what I reallywant to, about my thoughts, because I feel bad about them and about everything that they have to do with.&nbsp; No one really knows what my thoughts are, and this may be better because then they won't think that I just want attention.&nbsp; I feel like I've been keeping everything in, not saying what I want to, because I'm scared.&nbsp; But it's not important and all.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I did actually talk to Jen about my trichotillomania and it felt pretty nice to be able to not have people look at me differently.&nbsp; And then I was talking to Maura about like, well, the previous paragraph, but I just feel so terrible.&nbsp; I'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry.&nbsp; a billion times.&nbsp; I'd take it all back.&nbsp; There's no reason for me to drag everyone else down with me.&nbsp; </P>

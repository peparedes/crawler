"event","Hogwarts on the Web now has a detention hall for unruly students. You may recieve a detention from any professor or any administrator or assistant administrator. Those who recieve Detention will have to report to the Detention Hall located between the Prefect Bathroom and the Hourglasses.

Only Albus Dumbledore can approve of detentions. This should eliminate any unfair or unaccountable detentions occuring.

Detention on this site means that your account is suspended for a number of days according to whomever suspends you. All detentions must be approved by ME to see that there are no unnecessary detentions. Only I can suspend accounts.

When you are given a detention a PM will be sent to you saying to report in the detention hall. After you make that post in the hall your account will be suspended from that point forward.

You are only allowed to make three kinds of posts in the detention hall:

1.) Assigning a detention.
Only teachers and administrators can assign detentions to students. NO ONE ELSE including prefects can assign detentions. This is done in the ""Report Detentions Here"" thread.

2.) Enter a detention.
This post is done by the detained to say that they are reporting for detention. Failure to report will result in lost points and more detention time. This is the post that Dumbledore suspends your account after.

3.) Leaving a detention.
Dumbledore will unsuspend your account, PM/email you, and then you post that you are leaving detention. NO OTHER posts can be made inside the detention hall.

If you have questions about the Detention system please PM Dumbledore at: admin"

"event","Greetings from the Hogwarts on the Web Site Admin! 

I'd like to start by apologizing for not being on more! Particularly to my Arithmancy students... This last month or so has been very, tumultuous (please excuse bad spelling...) But I'm trying to be as on and active as possible.

Griphook has informed me that he is currently trying to get ahold of Cho to update vaults... When that update takes place I will Mass PM all members. 

I am going over the old assistant administrator applications, and I think I may have a winner, you'll know by the beginning of next month.

<b>CONGRATULATIONS TO SLYTHERIN!</b> With an amazing 250 points, they are the winners of the September, 2005 Monthly House Point Award! Slytherin house will be recieving a gift of 3 cases of Butterbeer and 2 flagons of Pumpkin Juice from the Leaky Cauldron. Hufflepuff is already on it's way to winning October's House Point Award, so get out there and earn those points! 

This month's member of the month is Annie Rall! Annie Rall is Hufflepuff house's prefect. She's an excellent poster and has been a member of the site since June 18th. Ms. Rall will recieve a Falcon Feather Quill and a bottle of yellow/black ink from Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop.

That's all for this month... Keep a postin'!"

"event","Usually when I do an entry like this it will be for the first of the month and what not... But because I'm behind... This is how it will work. Here's what's going on around the site.

Gringott's vaults <b>have been</b> updated for the month of September... Cho and Griphook have worked their little butts off, but remind you that if there's anything at all wrong with your vault to post in the <a href=""http://hogonwebb.proboards31.com/index.cgi?board=gringotts&action=display&thread=1117388274"">Changes</a> thread in Gringotts.

<b>CONGRATULATIONS</b> to member of the month: George Weasley. George has been a member of Hogwarts on the Web since June 3, 2005. He has 207 posts under his belt. While he is still without twin, George does a fantastic job and is an excellent poster. September's Member of the Month will recieve 100 points for his house and 50 galleons. If you are interested in becoming member of the month, then please (1) be a good poster, (2) be a frequent member, (3) have fun and try next month.

All assistant administrator applications have been reviewed. Some folks are being interviewed... So far we have one new Assistant Administrator and it is....*drumroll* Harry Potter aka Hayden! Congratulations to our newest Assistant Admin.

Just a reminder:
If you have not signed up for classes, please do so! It's all part of the fun. If you have signed up for classes, please make sure you attend and post. I know that Arithmancy is pretty sparce attendance-wise. (COUGHCOUGHGOTOCLASSCOUGHCOUGH!) :-D

Don't forget! Because of you and your votes in an astonishing 2 to 1 turn out, we will now have a yearly house cup and a monthly house cup awards. I will announce the winner on September 30th or October 1st. There will be a running tally available in the Hourglasses Section.

Thanks, and have a good one!

"event","Welcome to the Hogwarts on the Web Livejournal. We will use the journal to post new ideas, upcoming events, and new changes to the site.

Tonight (July 17th) marks the beginning of the July Ball. After much deliberation it was decided that a ball should be thrown in honor of all of the HP related July events. A full list of those events is located on the <a href=""http://hogonwebb.proboards31.com/index.cgi?board=greathall&action=display&thread=1121664486"">July Ball</a> thread in the Great Hall. Ask around for dates or come stag... It should be a lot of fun. The dance will close July 31st. 

The Ministry of Magic is FINALLY updated. The MoM now features all of the boards which make it up. We are waiting on a great minister. PLEASE DO NOT PM ME ASKING TO DO THIS. I WILL SAY NO. I PROMISE.

Hope you like this! Feel free to comment anonymously (it'd be nice if at the end you could tell us who you are... ALSO... If you already have a livejournal and would like to be ""friends"" let me know!

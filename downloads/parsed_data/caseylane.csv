I've been thoroughly stuck in Teen Wolf fiction for over a year and am just now starting to look at other fandoms. Any recomendations? Especially in James Bond and possible Blacklist with Red/Ressler. What else is hot at the moment?"

"event","So, I've started buying original fiction at Barnes & Noble that seems to be written by slash writers. The thing is, not all of them are good writers and, unlike fanfiction, it's not free. Is there somewhere on Dreamwidth or Live Journal that matches up fanfic writers with their pro names? 

Baring that, I know some of those on my list write original stories and publish, under what name? Do you have pro m/m authors that you like? I do read other things, (I'm going through a detective story phase right now) but when I'm looking for a good romance I would like to support good writers, and not feel cheated at the same time."

I went 86 days without a day off and worked between 55 &amp; 65 hours a week. Then I&nbsp;had 1 day off (Thanksgiving) and then not another one until Christmas Eve.

I feel totally detached from fandom. In fact the only thing I've been reading for the past few months is Teen Wolf fiction. I've listened to some podfic from Avengers, SGA and some J2 but that's about it. Have I&nbsp;missed anything good? Any drama? Like I said, I'm out of fandom and other than family time on Facebook may main haunts have been AO3 and news/politics.

My granddaughter has her surgery in March to separate her thumb and perhaps make 2 fingers. The doctor will decide then. It's being done at UofM Medical which&nbsp;is an excellent medical facility. Still, being so small we worry. Developmentally she is doing excellent and has reached all of her markers for a normal delivery, not to mention premie. We are very pleased. 

Hope everyone had a great year and I&nbsp;hope 2014 brings even better things. We, this country, can stand to have some good news so my prayers/wishes go out there as I reflect on some of the amazing changes this country has gone though. Marriage equity in Utah you all, who would have thought?"

I have a new granddaughter, Lillie Ried, that was born 7 weeks early. She did well for being a preemie. There is a problem with her hand though, she has been diagnosed with Apert's Syndrome but it's primarily in her hand. At least that's what the current testing is showing. Her left hand is missing some bones and it's formed together like a mitten. They will be able to make 2 fingers and a thumb out of it but it won't be very good for pinching motions. 

Other than that she's doing well developmentally and she's as sweet as anything.

Since my grandson is in AP math and while in 6th grade needs to go to the Jr. High for his math classes, he's moved in with me. It's just impossible for his mom to drive him to school in the morning with 2 children under 2 and 1 of them just recently out of the hospital. I'm loving it though, we are having so much fun and, although very energetic, he's a sweet boy.

Work has been kicking my ass. We are putting new system's and processes in place and my boss' are driving me crazy with a zillion emails a day. On top of that we are going through major renovations of the offices and things are in total chaos. My office is losing about 18 inches in width but at least my walls won't have the paneling falling down anymore. Nice.

Gosh, I just haven't shut up have I? See what happens when I don't visit very often?"

Did notice Crack Van is posting Teen Wolf stories and I&nbsp;can't believe there are so many stories I just haven't read. Of course the fic has exploded in that fandom and a good story can be buried under the deluge. Plus, the fact I only go to the journals and AO3 to find them. Anything on Tumbler that isn't cross posted won't be found by me.<br /><br />Still have a nice buzz from the election going on. I'll be honest, Obama won by a much larger margin than I thought he would.<br /><br />I go to a Republican site to listen to them talk, it's a good way to not get buried by only one opinion. (I have a fear of becoming blinded to only one side and becoming a Fox News Lite). Anyway there are huge fights going on between moderate GOP members and the Tea Party/Christian Right. Each side is calling each other wrong.<br /><br />What I find most disheartening, and one reason why I could never vote straight GOP, is the name calling. Single women are abortionists and low income people are lazy and greedy, wanting to be taken care of. I won't say it's all of them, some speak out about it, but I can say a lot of them feel that way. They have convinced themselves that the only reason Obama won was because he was offering &quot;free stuff&quot;. Women get abortions and birth control, the poor get everything paid for and everyone else gets free health care. <br /><br />I've voiced differing opinions a few times and have never been personally attacked, but I don't change minds. I don't raise too much of a stink there because it <em>is</em> their site. It was set up for young Republicans to go and discuss politics without censoring themselves."

I loved it. I mean, it was just a throw away line but it was there. Even though the movie was about bullying, I was still left a little speechless in pleasant surprise. Also, I haven't seen any ranting about subverting children. Oh I'm sure it's out there, on those websites that I don't go to because I don't want to stomp my computer in frustration.

3) Fast forwarding the romance angst is worth the price of Netflix.

In the beginning Tony and Pepper are still together and their eventual break up was handled beautifully, as was the treatment of Pepper throughout. The slow build up of Tony/Steve seemed to happen very organically. In fact, this entire story was well done. It's long and plotty, with a lot of humor but never slapstick.

H50 - Man, this show went from awesome to whatever in 2.3 seconds. It started with the last few episodes of last season and, baring a few individual episodes, never came back. I'm ready to stop watching and just read the fic.

Criminal Minds - Now, I don't read fic for this but it's kind of like meatloaf. It's a go to show to kill some time. I have to say their season finale was great. It was bittersweet and had that family feel that I just adore. One thing this show does well is shows that these people like each other and hang around together when they aren't working. It wasn't a cliffhanger either, it just left me happy and looking forward to next season.

Person of Interest - Yikes! Talk about a nail biter. This show is really very good, with it's two leads being made up of private, private people working together and slowly building a friendship. The secondary characters are wonderful too, with Kevin Chapman standing out as Fusco making us care for this unattractive, formerly dirty cop now working for the good guys.

Back to the finale though. It was tight and tense with surprises and angst and holy moly, I'm amazed. So much was going on it should have felt rushed. Instead it felt packed to the brim and nearly perfect. 

Grey's Anatomy - Nuff said.

Tonight it's Grimm and Supernatural. I can hardly wait."

What the hell, my job is stressful and it's a little joy (usually)&nbsp;to start the day with. It&nbsp;encourages&nbsp;me try new fandoms and authors. I also find some very good readers. 

Well, I just finished listening to an old SGA story and thought I would put out the word that if you listen to audiofic you just might want to give this one a try. It's called Every Day In Every Way by VelocityGrass and read by General Jinjur. 

I'll be honest, I love SGA. I'll also be honest again and say when I read stories I usually skim the sex. I've been reading fic since early Sentinel and between that and my, ahem... advancing years, I just don't find the sexy as hot as I used to. This story? 90% sex. But it's not. Yes it's full of sexy times but with each act you are with a John desperately in love with Rodney and trying, with gritted teeth and clenched hand, to keep that fact to himself, even as he's grateful for every single moment they spend together.. 

Rodney thinks it's an arrangement of convenience, even as he knows John is gay. Just two friends helping each other out until something better comes along. Until somehow, as time goes on,&nbsp;and he's starting to wonder if this just might be the best thing he's ever had. 

The thing is, If I had read this story I probably would have missed out on a lot of important emotional connection. I would have skimmed, and still thought it was a pretty good read. Listening to General Jinjur's excellent reading of the story while I drove didn't allow that. Instead I found myself about 30 minutes in going &quot;man, this is one hell of a story&quot;. 

Anyway, to make a long story short, this is one of those stories that make me grateful for fanfic and the readers who also put in so much time bring us joy.."

I made my decision and bought a Nook Simple Touch. I just wanted a reader and that one met my needs. It's simple, let's me download fanfic and also library books. I also wanted to purchase from a brick and mortar, even if it is a huge chain. At least they have local people working there.

I've gone to Crack Van at LJ and started reading stories from when they opened, 2003. Right now? Sentinel and Due South. Talk about a blast from the past. Any recommendations, either ""real"" books or fanfic? I'll upload them and enjoy them on my shiny new toy. 

Grimm, Grimm, Grimm. This show started out slow but has really picked up steam. I was actually antsy last Friday because there wasn't a new episode. Person of Interest is also grabbing my attention a lot. H50 is better now but I'm not totally in love like before, damn you TPTB for butting in."

Falling deeply in love with Grimm. As a show I was pretty underwhelmed when it first started but it really seems to be gelling now. Last night was damn creepy and satisfying. It's something I really look forward to. 

Most fic is Monroe/Nick but it's not what I'm really looking for. I would prefer something with Renard but there isn't much out there. I've also read a couple of stories on some one time plot players, Roddy/Barry and they were kind of sweet. Strangely enough, as much as I would like some good fic the show doesn't demand that I fill up the weaknesses with some.

My only resolution is to take my finances seriously this year. I actually didn't have any until I went upstairs to my office and tried to organize my bills to be ready for this year. 

Yep, that was a wake up call. It was a flippin mess. 

Of course now I'm feeling all OCD wanting to go up there and look at all of the spreadsheets and whatnot that I made, even if I don't have anything to put in. It gives me that ""first day of school"" feeling.

Been so busy I haven't even been reading fic...or books. I need a break or something. Especially since there is a 10 Year Canadian Shack revival going on. (Changed my icon in support). I loved the original and read every story, no matter the fandom or pairing. 500 words is just enough where you're willing to give something a try.

I have not seen the new Sherlock yet but I'm plenty spoiled. I'm expecting a lot of good fic to start surfacing soon (see above re: needing a break). 

Leverage was good last night and I'm very excited about the next episode.

Southland starts next week and that's exciting. Nice to see all the great reviews it's getting. Have to say, I'm sad Ben will be paired with Sammy now. I don't actually ship John/Ben but I liked the dichotomy of their work friendship and hope that's not lost."

I've been trying to catch up with Revenge since everyone around me is watching it. It's a tad soapy for my tastes but I'm soldering on because I'm&nbsp;hoping to find the excitement that others are talking about. So far? Nope.

Watching Person of Interest, which is amazing good. It continues to do things a bit differently and it's working out well. 

Although Once Upon a Time is a visually good show I find I actually like Grimm better. Maybe because OUaT seems to take itself a little too seriously. Plus&nbsp;I've never liked the lead. &nbsp;I still watch both shows.

I admitted I was your bitch years ago. Why oh why do you rub that fact into my face?

Case in point; I'm downloading audiofic to my iTouch for listening on my drive to work. I come across a Foxtrot/Calvin & Hobbs college fic. Did I feel disgust at slashing these guys that I usually see as children, even if they are all grown up in the story? 

Nope, not at all.

I instead thought, hummm...It's over an hour, I'll give it a try. It's turned out to be a PG (so far) story that's actually kind of sweet. Still, there must be something wrong with me that I would even read it. Right?

"event","I don't watch Merlin. I did watch the first season but not much since then. I still read the fic, not obsessively, but the show itself just kind of bores me. 

Hawaii-50 is on my maybe list. I'm still pissed about Danny/Rachel hooking up and I may end up not watching if it's not resolved to my satisfaction. Yes, I'm petty enough to let one storyline kick me off the show. I've just started reading the fic again recently because it took so long for me to stop going into a rage just thinking about the show. 

Torchwood? Dr. Who? I've stopped watching both. I gave Torchwood Miracle Day a chance, even though I'd stopped watching the original flavor, and find it not only boring but very poorly done. Shame because I love John.

I haven't watched more than a handful of episodes since Eccleston left (was forced to leave) Dr. Who. I didn't realize I watched exclusively for him until he left and I just couldn't be bothered after that. Oh I watched for awhile, liked Donna and all, but the joy was gone. 

Every once in a while I'll go back and try an episode but usually don't make it all the way through.

The reason I'm confessing is that Supernatural may fall into that category too. I didn't watch for years, while everyone else was gaga over the show. Then Castiel came in and even while hearing the enthusiastic reception I ignored it for 2 years. Then I thought, what the hell, TNT is showing it I'll give it a week.

Strangely enough my first episode was just before Dean was sent to hell (talk about timing) so within that week I saw the arrival of Castiel.

I was hooked, to put it mildly.

Now, after my love affair has fully taken root, it looks like the thing that actually made me want to watch may be gone. The rumors aren't encouraging.

So, Supernatural may become like Merlin, I'll read the fic but not bother to watch anymore. I'm not into Wincest at all and I'm not a true fan of gore so without the Dean/Cas friendship (or slash) there really isn't much to keep me around. 

I don't know, maybe it's because I'm getting older, but I just don't have patience for shows that don't make me happy. Doesn't mean I won't read the fic, just that I won't bother to watch."

Maybe Shaun the Sheep for my grandson too. Win for the television studios and a loss to Netflix.

I hate most television shows right now. See, I used to love them but now I hate them because of what they've been doing, or plan on doing, to the characters I like. H50 is already on my bad list, as is Supernatural. Now I'm putting H50 on twice, just because. Torchwood is straddling the fence alongside White Collar, we'll see where they land.

On my happy list? Warehouse 13. I actually like the new guy, he seems a nice fit. Sadly there is nothing that's actually Must Watch Live for me right now. 

In my quest to try some new fandoms I actually listened to a Bond/M fic called Queen of Spades by Resonant. I surprised myself because a) it was Bond and b) it was het. Still I like the author and the reader (Fay Jay) both so I gave it a try. It was actually very good. 

Also listened to a House/Chase fic (not bad). Have a Jeeves/Wooster and Smallville set for later on the list. None of these are fandoms I'm attached to.

I've decided to put off the anime for a bit. I would need to do some research to find out the overall theme and who's who to actually give the stories a chance. I tried one without doing that and felt I was missing too much information.

Still skipping the Sam/Dean because my incest squick is so big (yet oddly I could read twincest in HP). Have a gen story I'm going to give a chance that's already downloaded."

The minute I hear the theme music for Sherlock though it's like a switch is thrown and it's Hot Man Inside!!! For some reason being Sherlock makes it impossible to take my eyes off of him. I stare, I blush, I think pervy thoughts. Is it the coat? The arrogance? The chemistry with Martin Freeman? 

It makes my head want to explode from the confusion. Why the hell is this funny looking beanpole so damn intriguing?

Martin Freeman's Watson is another kettle of fish. I watched the pilot again last night (for the millionth time) and I get all tight and breathless watching Watson and Mycroft's interaction. Watson is in a decidedly dangerous position with a man he can't trust that has ""connections"" of a mysterious sort, yet he never shows fear and never raises his voice in trying to out macho Mycroft. Instead he just says no while exuding this quiet, dangerous, knowledge that nothing on this green earth will make him give in. Nothing. 

BAMF Watson is a thing to behold. He doesn't need big ass explosions, he's the guy that will quietly shoot you from afar and then go out for Chinese afterwards, all the while feeling smug because the only person who knows is the one he wants to know.

Oh show, please don't hurt me. I've been hurt twice this season by shows I gave my heart to, I need you and your slashy goodness to keep me believing in the goodness of mankind."

Since I started checking out the audiofic I saw there were tons of Dean/Sam and thought, what the hell, I should give it a try.

So, I started out with this really great post apocalyptic fic where everyone on earth disappeared except Dean and Sam. It was a great story, long and emotional with interesting bits while they accepted what happened.

Then the sex started. Ah, no. I just couldn't do it. The story was so good that I would lower the volume until the sex was done and then I would go back to listening. (I was driving and felt ff through my iTouch was too dangerous). 

I tried, if any story could do it for me it was this one, where they were literally the last two beings on earth. Still, no go. My mind kept wandering to my own brothers and I would just cringe and shiver and feel very icky. Obviously my incest taboo is very, very deeply ingrained.

Even though he most assuredly deserved it, I still feel sorry for my friend.<br /><br />Since this is a fannish site I will be cranky about fics and my relationship with them. <br /><br />First of all, I hate when I rec a fic to someone and they are all &quot;oh, that's an interesting take on <em>character x&quot;</em>. I'm like, dude, that's an awesome fic and how dare you not think it's the bee's knees. Then I think about the fic and realize it's got my buttons all over it and it just might not be the most in character piece out there. Now I not only dislike the fact the person I rec'd the fic to didn't like it but that they had a valid reason to feel the way they do.<br /><br />Well poo, I still love the out of character button pushing fic, so&nbsp; there.<br /><br />Still, I feel kind of resentful about going to their rec site, kinda like I&nbsp;don't belong. Like I've lost visiting privileges because I let my buttons get in the way of <em>real </em>fic recs.<br /><br />Next up is music in audiofics. Now I understand if I'm listening to American Idol fic there's going to be some singing. When I'm listening to a J2 AU, though,&nbsp;I don't want it. It's not that I don't like country music, because I listen to just about everything and will warble along with country songs as quickly as I do Katy Perry. <br /><br />First of all, they are loud. I've yet to hear music put into an audiofic that isn't almost twice as loud as the reader. It makes me jump back and wince like a late night commercial. Second of all, it's too long. 10 seconds, 30 tops,&nbsp; would be far less annoying. I want to get back to my boys pining for each other, or having sex, or fighting. I don't want to have to listen to someone singing about something else. I'm in it for the fic, not for you to convince me to go out and buy an album. <br /><br />Now lately I have noticed that some stories come in 2 versions, with and without music. I am very, very grateful. Right now though I'm trying to catch up with older stories so I'm not being given that option. What I&nbsp;end up doing is fast forward through the music and end up listening to the chipmunks version of love gone bad. It's not pretty.<br /><br />So sorry if I&nbsp;offended someone with my crankiness. Hopefully tomorrow I'll be back to my happy self and just be grateful that I have fanfic and audiofic. When I first started out in fandom I was so happy&nbsp;to find out that I wasn't the only weird person out there thinking Kirk and Spock or Duncan and Methos&nbsp;should be together. It was very lonely out there and maybe I should just count my friggin' blessings."

So, did something happen and H50&nbsp;managed to take&nbsp;over the entire&nbsp;world while I was busy crying/dancing/drinking? People, there is so much fic out there I almost had to check and make sure I hadn't defriended everyone but the H50 communities. 

I need to take a vacation just to read. Not that that's a bad idea but I&nbsp;can't afford to take any more time off work right now. Still, fic! Plus I saw some Dean/Castiel posted on CrackVan and since I'm new to that fandom everything there is new to me. Can I go home and lock my door and hunker down with my computer now? I want to relax with some hot, steamy McDanno right damn now."

I'm also too lazy to copy. Thought it was interesting though. Looks like Steve is still sleeping in his old room. <br />"

"event","Since I&nbsp;got my tax refund I've been on the computer making a ton of purchases and donations. Within the last hour I've spent far too much money but, what the hell, it's only once a year.

Anyway my phone rings and I see Toll Free. Almost didn't answer since it's 10.30 PM here. Still, I&nbsp;know sales can't call this late so I&nbsp;did. It was my Credit Union making sure I,&nbsp;(1) Haven't lost my card or (2) Gone crazy.

I&nbsp;reassured&nbsp;him on number 1 but plead the 5th on the second. Glad to know they called to double check. 

Thanks goodness I hadn't purchased something from Xandria or Adam &amp; Eve because I sure would have been embarrassed hearing him mention those businesses when he started listing&nbsp;off the organizations."

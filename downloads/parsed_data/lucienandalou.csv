"event","Happy New Year everyone! Last year was pretty swell for me, no regrets. Each year I had a pretty different celebration, unless for this past two years. I hung out with Diane. The most memorable one was New Year's Eve 2000. My friend, Rhys, and I were planning to go to a rave in South San Francisco which turned out to be a trannies New Year's Eve party. That was awesome cause I finally got the chance to see Rhys naked. Last night I hung out with Diane, Jason, and Sheena. There were a couple of parties going on, but I wasn't really in the mood of going. I like a laid back environment where people aren't trying so hard to impress other people. 

Miqy made a pretty spread out mix of food. We had guacamole, chips, chex mix, pistachios, and fried calamari. See what I mean? I had root beer and coffee too. I don't know if they are a good combo for your tummy. By the end of the night I was so full and my stomach felt weird. 

I've sold some items on eBay and unfortunately some of the money hasn't made it yet to my bank account. I am gonna go to Anthropologie with Diane today and I was planning to get some frames. My place is so scarce of pictures. I guess I cannot get it today then. I don't know if Anthropologie is open anyway. I tried to call them last night but no one picked up the phone. I am planning to call them later in the afternoon. If they are not open, then Diane and I are probably just gonna get lunch. 

I hope my friendship with Diane will be ok. I can see that she tries to have more quality time with me. It just sucks when a good friendship has to end cause someone doesn't care enough to maintain it. There's nothing I hate more than having a beef with my close friend, not that I am having a fight with Diane but I can see we would have an argument, maybe, if she keeps avoiding to hang out. Well, speaking about beef, I had this stupid fight with my friend in San Francisco over stupid thing. I would rather not to mention what it was about. I think some people still don't get me. If you have problem with me, I want you to let me know. It's not like I am gonna bite your head off or hold my grudge until the day I die. I considered myself pretty easy to talk to. I will be honest with you and you might not like it, but hey, I want you to do the same. I might not like it either, but I am gonna try my best to deal with it. If someone has a problem with me, I would like to clear that up. I don't like people who sulk and be passive aggresive. That's what a coward do and absolutely bad attitude. Taking criticism or admitting that you are wrong is hard, but hey, you and I are not perfect people, so get over it!

Fortunately, my friend is pretty much like me. Well, he had to be a stubborn first and then finally gave up. Ego. Our friendship is much more important. Yes Mark, I still love ya and no hard feelings! I felt soooo much better knowing that we could talk about it and got over it.

I am at Miqy's work now. He had to open the store today. I was going to stay at home, but I just think it would be nice to come with him. He needs something to cheer him up cause going to work on New Year's Day isn't really a great plan to spend your day. K, I am off now! Hope ya all have a great day!!"

"event","I just got a package from my Mom. She sent me fried anchovies, fried red onion, and dried beef. I know you must think it's yucky, but it's actually really good. The dried beef is good with porridge. I really miss Indonesian food and there's no goddamn Indonesian restaurant over here. Well, there are several restaurant who serve Indonesian food in their menu, but they are not authentic. I've tried one of them and it wasn't really good. 

There was a Tsunami in South East Asia and one of the biggest earthquake in history happened in Indonesia, Sumatra to be correct. All my friends called me to make sure my family are ok. That's really sweet, but my family are in Java island. I hope they are ok and I assumed so, cause my uncle called me yesterday morning and he did not mention if he was floating on top of a piece of wood. So, I guess they are ok. Thanks though guys to really pay attention about it. 

I tried to close my savings account with Bank of America today and boy, are they complicated. I made this savings account originally to apply for their credit card. I do not have enough credit history so they told me to send money to open a savings account with them. I haven't got any credit card and I did this almost a year maybe? So I have this money that was just sitting around and I couldn't do anything with it. I decided to close it, so I called them. First, they told me I have an overdrawn. Hello, are you fuckin kidding me? He transfered me to another dept. to talk about it and they said I had to close my credit card first. Hello again, I DO NOT have a credit card! So they transfered me to credit card dept. and they said they couldn't find my account and this dept. was for credit card related only. Helloooo, is this thing broken? They transfered me to you! They told me to come to the bank and close it from there. I swear I almost went off at her. I decided to call again and fyuh, this guy knew what he was doing. I will get my money back 7 to 10 business day! Woohoo!!

I woke up almost at 11am and I thought I was going to clean the house, but I got lazy so I just watched <u>Ghost</u> on HBO. Miqy called me around 1pm I think and he was heading home. It was a slow day at work. After I was done watching Ghost, we headed to Target to get a floor lamp, mine was broken. I felt like I really got ripped off by Pottery Barn. We got this pretty cool lamp that uses 3-way bulb. God bless 3 way! It has 4 legs and 3 differeent size of plates in the middle. We finally got a decent door mat that will work to take off all the dirt and snow from our shoes. We got Christmas lights, they are on sale! We got blue Christmas lights to put in our bedroom for 86 cents! Miqy got white Christmas lights for his art room. I got this vintage looking white basket for magazines. We got a pretty good deal cause Miqy got a gift card from his boss.

We also still has a couple gift cards from his family when we got married. We still have Office Max and Bed Bath and Beyond. I need to get a bath mat. I threw away the old pink bath mat that I bought from IKEA. Miqy's cat liked to sleep on it and scratch it. It was pretty much destroyed. 

From Target we dropped all the stuff at home and we went to La Pasadita. That was a bad but good place. Miqy had been telling me about their steak burrito. I got their steak tacos a couple days ago and it was so greasy and good! Pure fat! Today we got steak burritos and it was just steak, cheese, onion and cilantro, and sour cream. That's it. I didn't even finish it cause toward the end I felt so bloated, and everytime I burp, I still can feel the steak. It was probably really bad for your body, but hey, I do not eat that everyday.  That's my defense.

I just got new pics from my Mom. She gave me pics of me with Sashimi and she gave me pic of my sister and Rod, her and my Mom when they were at a pumpkin farm, I think. They were picking a pumpkin for Halloween. I might post one of my new pics at friendster, so if you are curious to see it.

I feel like I want to talk to someone right now. I don't know what I wanna talk about exactly, just about anything and it has to be with someone that I close with. Maybe in a coffee house?"

"event","Merry Christmas everyone! I am in Miqy's parents' house right now. We came in the morning. His Dad picked us up at 8am, imagine that. His brother and his sister in law came too around 9am and we had breakfast. It was good and hit the right spot. They brought their Jack Ruseel, Wrigley. She was so adorable and amazingly hyper. It makes me want to have a small dog, and not because they are hyper but they're cute. Well, Sashimi is undeniably cute too. 

We opened presents and I got loads of them, especially from my mother in law, Corky. I got cute pantyhoses. I can imagine wearing them with my black mini skirt and my kitten heels shoes. She made cross stitchings of my bathroom and put them on a frame. They are nice and I do want to put them on my bathroom, but it just seems my apt would look like old people apt. Some of the gifts from her, not that they are not nice, but I just start thinking if she really knows me. The gesture that counts, right?

We went to see <u>Meet the Fockers</u> and it was actually quite entertaining. I liked the 1st one too. I think the 2nd one wasn't going too overboard like I felt about the 1st one. I don't know. 

Everytime I came to my mother in law's house, I am so amazed how she could keep her house so clean and tidy. I keep telling myself to be better at cleaning the house, but when I get home, I just want to do anything else but cleaning. Maybe I can use some of this holiday time to clean the house. It's pretty hard when you have 4 trouble makers at home. Sashimi now is leaving a little chunk of his fur everywhere. Since when he starts shedding? Ashtray starts a new habit of getting into the kitchen cabinet at night when we're in bed, so all we could hear from the bedroom is rattling noise of pots and pans. It's driving me crazy. 

I am trying to do better with money now. Before, I didn't really calculate how much money I have and how much money I should spend on shopping. I did a little better this time, hopefully in the future too. I can't wait to go back to work and get my paycheck. There are several items that I've been eyeing from Anthropologie and Penelope. 

I am really happy with Miqy's presents for me :). I got a cardigan that I want from Anthro, I got the 3rd movie of Lord of the Rings, now I have all of them. I got Sex and the City Trivia game. I could play that with Courtney and Diane :D. I got this stuff animal, a cartepilar I think. It has three separated parts of its body which is connected with an elastic string. It's yellow and red, which I thought at first he gave me a Winnie the Pooh toy, glad that I was wrong. It only has three teeth and its called Mr. TTT, how cute is that? I got little presents too from the stockings, my fave chocolate, Ferrero Rocher, and bath salt. 

I only got Miqy two gifts cause I didn't really have money. Well, actually I got him three but the third gift haven't got shipped yet, I think. I bought this shirt from <u>fuckyoga.com</u> and as you can guess, the shirt said 'fuck yoga'. Miqy saw it from <u>Sex and the City</u> and he thought it was funny, so I got it for him. This store is sooo fuckin' unorganized. I didn't get any confirmation number for my order, nor tracking number for the shipping. That's why I assumed they haven't shipped it yet. I emailed them and they told me they would get back to me later that day. As  you can guess, they didn't. I emailed them again and they haven't emailed me back. I am so going to file a claim after 30 days. Good thing that they don't even have their own payment process. They have to use paypal. If you are curious about this store, you can check their website and I bet you can tell from their website how unorganized they are. There's no store who said they're <b>SOMETIMES</b> open on Mondays. It's either you're open or you're not, and the store hours start from 12:30pm! What kind of lazy motherfucker they are? Oh, it's not just 12:30, it is 12:30-ish! If you can't even make up your mind when your store hours are, don't open one! If they think it's witty, it's just straight dumb. Are they really New Yorker? I doubt that. 

Ok, I think I have to control myself from yelling, but hope all of ya have a good Christmas!!"

"event","It is fuckin' cold in my living room. My fingers are officially numb and I've been making a lot of typos. My heater is weird. It is really warm in the bedroom and kitchen. No wonder this apt is cheap!

Miqy and I got several Christmas presents for everyone. I can't give Christmas presents to all people that I wanted to. I am broke and yet, I just made a quick visit to Penelope. For people that doesn't get a Christmas present from me, I apologize. Well, I don't even celebrate the goddamn Christmas. I just feel bad when people give me present and I don't reciprocate. 

I realize that I do not really hang out much with my close friends anymore. Dave, we don't have class together and for some reason, this semester we've been busy with ourselves. I can't get Dave to hang out with. He doesn't come to the city, correction, he doesn't come to the city unless there's something in it for him. Honestly, I don't feel the same way anymore about Dave since Miqy went to the hospital. Wanna know why? Well, it's none of your fuckin business, little fucker. I just think he didn't try to be there for me when I needed him.

Diane, I know she's been busy with school and we all are. I just think since she's been together with Jason, it's really hard to get in touch with her. She doesn't even return my phone call sometimes. It's hard to find a time to hang out with her too. 

Honestly, I am not the most available people either these days. I just remember what Joe told me, once you are in a relationship, you will become more anti-social. I think that has to be true. I do care my relationships with my friends, but I do not put as much effort as when I was single. That is just one sad reality. I do want to go out with  my friends, but sometimes I just don't have money or I just don't feel like going out, especially now, it is frickin' cold!

"event","Time to change the lay out of this journal. There should be something cheerful to company the title of my journal. I think that would be cool if death is purple isntead of black. It's so over used. I went to work this morning and I was so boring, a complete waste of time. Well, I hung out with Diane though. We were just talking like usual. She went back home tomorrow morning and she'll be back on the 31st. She will come over to my place with Jason on New Year's Eve. It's not like it is a big event for me, but again, it's over used, an excuse to celebrate and promise other people and delude themselves to make a resolution. My New Year's resolution? Not to make a resolution. 

There's a change of plan for next semester. I thought I would never have to deal with the Cage, but I guess I was wrong. I haven't applied for OPT like I should have done it 2 months ago. I won't be able to apply for a job outside school, so I asked Nathalie if she could hire me for one more semester and I need more hours. She said ok and I asked if it would be possible to get a position as a part time staff. She said I needed to talk to Charlie. Fortunately, I know Charlie pretty well. I used to take his class and we've been communicating well since then. It was pretty easy to ask him though I didn't expect him to do me a favor. I have to be thankful cause it seems there's a chance for me to hired as a part time next semester. I just need more hours, as much as possible. Another thing, Nathalie recommended me to Wen-Wha ( I don't know how to write her name), she's the Production I/II coordinator, to be her assistant. I don't know, it's only 20 hours a week where I could work 25 up to 30 hours a week as a part time staff, but I don't have to deal with people in the cage anymore. It is a hard choice cause I really need the money and how desperate am I if 4 dollars a week make that much different in my decision making? I don't know let's see, cause I heard that part time staff actually get paid the same amount of money per hour as faculty assistant does. 

This holiday sucks cause Miqy and I are short of money, so we can't really buy gifts for people that we really want to spend money for. Tough, tough, tough. I am trying to intern in Opt1mus cause they are paying. Not much, but it's ok. 

I haven't talked to Yafisa again. I talked to her about a couple weeks ago? It seems very long cause usually we talked almost everyday. I don't know what's going on in her life, but apparently it's pretty messy. I am just thinking right now if I've been a good friend to all my friends. Is marriage really making me a total anti-social? I realize from the beginning I came to the US that I am a homebody. Well, I was a homebody when I used to live in Indonesia due to my Mom's paranoia that I would get killed if I went out late night or even too much with my friends. I feel like I don't have the energy to go out anymore. I always go to bed by midnight. That's boring. I mean, it's not like there's something to do anyway and I am usually so tired by 11pm. There's an urge to go out but there's a side of me telling that it's better to be lazy, slouching on the couch covered by my grandma's red fuzzy blanket watching Law&Order: SVU and it's cold anyway outside, you don't need to freeze your buns off. That kind of sound in my head, everytime I am trying to go out and most of the time, I just succumb to those words. 

I want to sell my computer. It's an old iMac G4, that used to be hot, not anymore. Reason? I need to get a laptop that's more practical. If anyone's interested in seeing pictures or asking questions, email me and we'll talk. It has alot amenities. That's a good word. 

I am so hungry right now and Miqy is getting me chicken tacos :). Reason? Diane got chicken tacos from the 7th floor and she told me I could have some. I went to the bathroom and she has finished them. Damn her! 

Oh, where is Miqy? I am hungry. Tonight we're supposed to go to see this show. I don't know if I want to go. Yes, those words again plus I want to see Lemony Snicket tomorrow, but damn, I just remember that we're gonna go to his parents' house. I don't know if I want to go today. Maybe I can go Monday. It will be less crowded than weekend.

"event","I literally passed out last night after I had dinner, and woke up in the middle of the night on the couch covered with my grandma's red fuzzy blanket. Thanksgiving was good. That was the first time Miqy and I cooked, and nothing was burnt. I've been looking for jobs and nothing really struck me. At some point, I am scared myself thinking if this is the right thing for me, but the scarier part is, what is then? For some reason, I don't think I am a good editor. I am just so plain. Am I just trying to fit in with the rest of the posers? Well, I hate them so I don't fit in there either. Maybe in some odd ways they are actually the real thing. Maybe I should talk more about films or making films, maybe I should act more passionate about it. The idea of listening people talk about their project make me feel sick. It just sounds like they are so full of it. I don't read books about filmmakers. I only read what I like and I'm not gonna read something that people assume I have to know, or should I? I don't watch films that every filmmakers should've watched. If you're a 'serious' filmmaker then you would know what films I'm referring to. 

Miqy told me how amazed he was with me. He said I was just living my life without having any questions of who or what I am doing in this world. Maybe the truth is, I am to scared to stop and think who I really am and what I am really doing or what I really want or whether I really have a talent in what I am doing now. I don't want to blame my parents, but I sorta always think that this is what I am supposed to do in my life. Go to school, go to college, pick a major, get a job, get married, make babies, be a parent. Not that I agree with all of those steps but I've been taught that there's no word taking a break in the middle of that process. When I hit a certain age, later, my family sure want to know if I'm considering to have a baby cause god knows that my clock is ticking. 

Ok, I have to get ready to meet Tina. We're gonna go shopping. That's the only thing I know I am good at."

"event","I haven't really got in the mood for writing this journal. What's the fucking point, right? Nobody wants to listen so I decided to write. It's been ok lately. No really big changes in my life. Miqy got his job back in Kinko's so that's good news. I started to worry we would be living on the street by the end on December. That would be a very sad new year, on the other hand I would've had a finally new year resolution, which would be finding a new husband. I don't really know what I'm talking about.

Lately I've been decided to stop a lot of things. I decided to stop drinking, but it doesn't really mean I would never have a drink ever in my life again. It's just not right now. I decided not to eat too much meat. In fact, I only eat meat on Saturdays and only poultry. I still eat seafood like always. You can say I'm a semi-vegitarian or, even a vegetarian wannabe. That's ok too. I decided not to let my ego got in the way, so I reconnected with an old friend from San Francisco. We've been emailing each other. He's currently in LA, studying film directing. All I can say, good luck!

This Thanksgiving I'm just gonna stay in the city. Miqy parents are gonna go to Pittsburgh to see their family. Yafisa might come but I doubt it will happen. She's so flaky. I'm just so tired of it. Whatever, really. 

I still don't know what I'm gonna do after school is over. Somehow I'm thinking about LA and it's just mind boggling. I don't want to move to LA but if there's a really good job, then again, why not? I don't know. I know that I don't want to stay in Chicago. I really want to go back to San Francisco. It's just I am not sure if I can get a job there. 

 Last Tuesday, November 16th, was our 4 months anniversary. I don't know if I can get into a year anniversary. It just seems so long. I'm not sure either if there's gonna be any ceremony. 

This morning Miqy told me he's gonna take me to watch the new <u>Bridget Jones' Diary</u> even though I know he's not interested in seeing Hugh Grant, hehe... I mean I don't really wanna see that movie either. I can wait for the DVD or even until it shows up on TV. That's just really sweet of him.

I just tolerated them, but lately, I can't take it anymore. Most of the part timers suck and the new people who work there think they're so fucking cool. Give me a fuckin break. That place is just so scandalous and I am just so disgusted of what people would do to get ahead. Well, I guess it's right, you have to give a head to get ahead. 

It isn't bad enough that I have to work with a guy that I had a one night stand with, but I also have to work with a bible thumper. I just feel like god is really punishing me for casual sex. Why the hell he has to change his major? And why the hell he has to work with me? It's not that the sex is taunting me because it was so good. It's taunting me because it was so horrible. I don't really wanna see him ever again, and he just acted like nothing happened. He really gets on my nerves too. He is weird to begin with and he always asks these questions about work that he's supposed to know already. 

Today, these two guys decided to ""correct"" my mistake. They told me that I screwed up because I didn't put a piece of paper in the right place. I told them that I was sorry I misplaced the paper and then they told me it's ok they weren't mad at me. Hello, who the fuck do you think you are?  First of all, calm the fuck down. You could've just scanned the item and it would tell you the due date on the computer and the rest of the items that person checked out. Second of all, both of them aren't perfect either. They both forgot to check out couple items and I caught it when I checked the stuff back in on Monday morning. I didn't say anything to them cause I know I am not perfect either. It's not that I can't take criticism. If I do something wrong, I want people to tell that on my face BUT there's a way to tell people they made a mistake. Don't tell me I screwed up when you're not perfect either. So until you're perfect, just shut your whores. 

There's one person that I despise. If I could, I would like to smear a monistat on his mouth. He's so arrogant, he thinks he knows everything and oh, he's so wit and good looking. He's just the biggest homophobe sexist asshole and loser. ""Oh yeah, I have authority and I can use it the way I want."" Fuck you and yeah, you can rot in there too. I am just gonna work there, not socialize with them. 

There are only a few people that I still like to talk to and I can't just wait to graduate, and so long suckers! 

Recently I become close with Courtney. She's cool to hang out with and share the same kinda sense of humor and sarcasm. Weirdly, I feel kinda distant with Diane and Dave. I was a little bit upset with Dave when he didn't come over when I needed him to. I just felt that he isn't really be there for me. I wanted him to be there for me over a pretty serious stuff not because I can't decide what my nail color should be. Diane, I just feel that she's really wrapped up in her relationship. I know that she's busy with school and I understand that, but she can't really make a time for me to hang out with her cause she has to make her time first for her boyfriend. I don't know if this is fair cause I'm  pretty wrapped up myself with Miqy but I still want to hang out with my close friends without the presence of my husband all the time. I don't know, I think I can't really judge how she do her relationship. I just feel that I barely hang out with her anymore. 

I am not doing anything special tonight and I am ok with that. I've never really celebrated Halloween anyway. I was gonna go to Ricardo's party but then Courtney isn't gonna go because she's still in the suburb. I know who's gonna be in Ricardo's party and I don't think I can handle them myself without someone that I can relate too. I'm not a big party person anyway. 

Well, I am gonna look for my cloves cause I just have this crave to smoke. Happy Halloween!"

"event","Sometimes I keep asking myself why I live my life the way I do. Life has been crazy lately but I am not sure if it affected me the way it should've been. I just can't understand why I'm still here. Why I'm not scared by it. It won't be wise to analyze everything too much of course. That's a given. I just gave up to find the answer even though, it is still running in circle in my head. 

I am glad that I had someone to accompany me during those hard days but there were times I was still alone and there were times that I definitely couldn't express my feelings or said the words I wanted to say. It just burried in my brain. I think I lost someone that I could connect to communicate. I know I can't rush these things to happen instantly. There will be time, I'm sure. 

When I was alone, I just didn't know who to call for listening to me. Someone to be with me. I just thought they wouldn't understand. The only one I thought would understand didn't see how important it was for me. I just lost all my trust to him. I tried not to make a big deal out of it. I tried to be an adult. Was I?"

"event","I woke up hungry so I made myself a fried noodle. I had this weird dream about my teeth were bleeding. I don't know what it means but I don't feel so good about it. In the morning I took my mom to the airport. She's gonna be in Atlanta for a week. It's a pretty good break for me and Miqy. We didn't really waste our time but we made a stop at downtown cause I always need to shop. I got new movies from Virgin. <u>Irreversible, Brakhage: Anthology, THX 1138: Director's Cut.</u> I went to Victoria's Secret and got some new bras. 

Later that day, we went to see Ratatat at Sonotheque. Their music is pretty good. I've been listening them for a while through my iPod. Sonotheque itself was a pretty cool club. It's hip and trendy. We got ourself a spot on the stools. Miqy had the usual whiskey and coke, while I wanted Mojito but they didn't have it so I had Cosmopolitan instead. We were just talking while the first band was playing. I think it was Enon and they were pretty good. Miqy went out to call his parents to ask whether they're gonna come over or not since the football game they're gonna watch was postponed. I was just sitting there, enjoying the music and the drink, and this guy next to me started talking to me. He was definitely flirting and I found out he was in Ratatat. He introduced himself as Mike. First, I thought he was joking about being in a band or trying to look cool to get in my pants, but he was really in the band and he was also really just trying to get in my pants. The second I introduced Miqy as my husband to him, he was gone. It was pretty cool to see the expression on his face. 

Well, I am not gonna lie and say I wasn't flattered, cause I was. It felt good to know someone is attracted to you, even though it was only a physical attraction and my shallow part felt good cause he was in the band. As much as I had this curiousity what might happen if I didn't have a husband, but I am glad that I have a husband, and introduced Miqy as my husband was the coolest part from it. It was way cooler than having a one night stand with Mike from Ratatat. Who the fuck is Ratatat, right? 

I went home wasted. It was a mix of good pot I had before we went to the show and I had a few glasses of cocktails. We took a walk and it was actually quite a walk but I was drunk, so I didn't really feel it. I was trying to hit all doorbells and just being silly. When we got home, I just passed out in the bed. Now I'm awake and it's 5:30am. I wanna watch some tv."

"event","It's been three weeks and one day since I moved in to my new place. Things are going great even though my mom is here. Miqy has been working a lot lately, feeling a little bit neglected but I know it's just my brain. I've been feeling that I chowed down too much hormones since I've taken the birth control pill. It made me really emotional on simpe things and it was really codependent of me. I quit now and I still haven't felt any difference. What scares me, how after I've been in a long term relationship I am just emotionally codependent? You know, that comfortable feeling that you're taken care of and you have this huge expectation it's gonna be like that forever, where actually it is just a privilege, not our husband/bf obligation to us. I wish it's really just the pill talking. 

I don't know how many times I have mentioned this, but it scares me that fall will be my last semester. I mean, I don't wanna stay in school any longer. I wanna have a job, but as far as getting a job in film, I don't know. I want to work as an assistant editor more than being an editor. IF, I work with film, not computer. I just love touching film, feeling the emulsion and sticky base on my fingers, cutting and splicing them together. 

I also want to go back to school for Marine Biology. I know, it has nothing to do with film, but it could be. There's no Marine Biology major in Chicago plus I kinda want to do it in California. I can't count on getting a scholarship. I just have thousand things that I want to do and it's pretty impossible since one suck people created these things called bills and rent. I don't mind working though. I like working cause it gives me money to go shopping and adopting a dog!

I am so getting closer in adopting a dog. I don't know from where though. I saw this really cute husky in anti-cruelty and I really wanted adopted him, but I changed my mind to wait a little bit longer. Originally, I want to adopt a dog from  furry friends and they have this one cute dog. I dont' know if he gets along with cats though. I gotta have to stop shopping! I need the money for the dog and for the trip to San Francisco on January.  

Next Monday, I'll be in school again!"

"event","I officially have moved in to my new apt. I can't believe that it's a really cool place and someone would give that up. Well, lucky me ;)! I haven't unpacked all the stuff yet. Yesterday Miqy and I were painting our bedroom with bright yellow color and it's really cute. We got a free couch from his Dad. It's leather and it's in seafoam color. I was so psyched when I saw it. How weird that I was thinking to get a Marc Jacobs handbag in seafoam color and I got a couch with that color. 

I am just so excited to decorate my apt. I want it to be in vintage European style, which will be weird with some mix stuff from IKEA. If I have the money right now, I would just go shopping for furniture and stay at home all day decorating. Speaking about this, I got myself thinking this crazy thoughts that maybe I wanna be a full time housewife. I know I know, you might judge me to live up the stereotyoes of what women should be. I was against this stuff. I wanna be a working housewife and fuck all that shit about taking care the house and my husband full time. Who has the time right, if you work 60-80 hours a week? 

For some reasons, I think it might be cool to take care of the house, take some cooking and yoga classes, maybe a baby? See, my brain has been abducted and replaced by the Stepford Wives syndicate during my sleep. I know, that this things are impossible for me to do. We just don't have that kind of money to make me stay at home and I understand that. Plus, deep down I know that I would feel incomplete and drive myself crazy if I don't do anything besides taking care the house. I need to be outside, working and do something for the community. Make a lot of money and go shopping! Hee hee... Plus I would feel so guilty of going to school and spent that much money if I just end up working as a housewife. I hope this is the end of my crazy thoughts, but I wouldn't judge women who want to be a fulltime mother or housewife...anymore, cause I know that they might be smart women and I should totally respect other's choice about how they wanna live their life. 

My mom is coming next Friday and I just can't believe it. I'm excited to show her my new place, especially she's gonna meet Miqy. Somehow, I don't think she would really appreciate my new apt though. She always has something to complain about. So I'll see what she might say and take it with the grain of salt. 

Today I am gonna go to IKEA to get a bookshelf and bathroom storage. We're gonna borrow Miqy's Dad's car. After that, we're gonna go back to their place and hang out, maybe stay over. I need to talk about my loan and my INS paper work. I can't wait to go to IKEA!"

I've worked 3 shifts for being a projectionist for High School Institute Final Film Screenings, and I got paid $75 for each. That was pretty good. So I took my lazy ass to downtown. I had a little splurge. I bought two pair of shoes. A pump and an ankle boots. The ankle boots hurt my feet, so I probably will return that one and it was more expensive anyway. I got new eyeshadows from Stila, I think. I opened one of them and it was cracked, so I am gonna go there and exchange it. I got this bronzer from Lorac, which you can mix it with your foundation, so I did that and I looked really glossy now. I want to have a dewy look but everytime, I think I got it, I always think I look so oily. I got fishnets. I've never had one before and I got two from DKNY. They are so cute and funky. 

I went home and I had a message from Victor. I called him back and we hung out later this afternoon. We were going to see <u>Collateral</u> but we ended up staying in his apt, smoking weed and watching this Japan anime called, <u>Tokyo Godfathers</u>. It was sooo goddamn funny. I regret that I didn't rent it from Blockbusters everytime I saw it on the shelf. I want to buy the DVD, and yes, I'm still trying to buy <u>Triplets of Belleville</u>. I was bidding it on ebay but I got outbidded. I got Godard's <u>Weekend</u> from half.com and it was a fucking weird awesome movie. I got a French movie <u>Fat Girl</u> from ebay and I heard from Alarik it was good. I keep my fingers cross. 

Before I got here, I ate sushi for dinner. I went to my fave sushi restaurant <i>Nohana</i>. I sat there, looked at the menu, ordered, and opened my chopsticks package. I only got one chopstick. How bizzard, from thousand and thousand chopsticks that got distributed around the world, I got a package that only had one chopstick? It is an item that is destined to be a pair, what is it trying to tell me? I am pretty sure that I wasn't high anymore but I came up with this somewhat cliche and vague theory that if even an item that is supposed to come in a pair got seperated, what's the chance for us, human, who is born as an individual will ever be possible to have an everlasting relationship? I always somewhat belive existentialism. 

I got check from <u>Batman</u>. At least, they sent my check. Chuck always called me on my home number and I always called him back, telling him not to call to my home number. I always check my answering machine at least once every a few days. I always get my message late. 

Tomorrow I have meeting with Dave in school. It's not until 1 though. I am just gonna wake up a little bit late and get breakfast. I can taste and smell the eggs and bacon. Yum. 

Miqy has started packing our books and he realized that we're still kinda too early to pack. I can't pack unless we really HAVE to. I guess, it's the thrill and I am always afraid that I will need the item that I have already packed later on. So we have 4 boxes worth of books and I think, he hasn't done yet with the books. Our cats, my cats exactly, like those boxes cause we stacked them. They are perfect places for them to be a little bit taller and have the right angle to attack Miqy's cat. His cat, Wady, likes to jump to the second shelf from the bottom of the bookshelf just to lay there. 

I finally found a website that I can order <u>Hatching Beauty</u>! That was an amazing film and Amy Hicks is from San Francisco. That movie gives me hope. I am so happy that I will have a copy of that movie. It was really hard to find before. They're not even listed in the fuckin imdb."

"event","Today is definitely not summer. It was pretty chilli when I went to work and tonight, I have to hide under my down comforter. What kind of summer is this? I am so tempted to go back to San Francisco just for a week. Summer over there is probably the same like today but the weather isn't really upside down that much. I would've gone but it wouldn't be fair to Miqy cause we have to start packing up our stuff. 

Today we went to the North Clybourn Group to sign the lease. Now it's official that we have a place to live by the end of August. I just realized how close I am to Wicker Park. I can take a walk for a few minutes. Plus, I dicovered today from Joe that he just lives 5 blocks away from me. How fabulous is that? My gay friend just 5 blocks away, in case of emergency. 

Chuck has been calling me in need of my presence to be there as a PA. It sounds like an act of desperation. No wonder they are short of people, because the job sucks. I won't blame those one timers. They have something else better to do than stand up for 12 hours. 

Last weekend I spent most of my nights at Kinko's, waiting for Miqy to get off work. He took some extra hours, so he could get paid overtime. We could really use the money for our security deposit and moving fund. I came around 9-ish with his dinner and I spent the rest of the time using internet in the back office and he came to check once in a while with some occasional making out, or I walked outside to see him working. He worked until midnight in Kinko's Clark and Division, and I think he's gonna do it for the next 2 weekends. 

I went to see <u>The Village</u> with Diane. It was pretty good and I think it's a little bit better than the <u>The Sign</u>. Enough said. Sunday I was hanging out again with Diane, and Sheena. Diane was going to get a hair cut but the place was closed when we got there. We were waiting for Sheena and went to this really cute accessories store called Glam to Go. It's a really good store. I got my new earrings and necklace. They are both really cute. We went to my place to watch <u>Sex and The City: season 2</u>. 

Marleah is in New York, so I am just gonna wait until she calls me. This weekend I am afraid that I am going to get a call from Chuck again, and I just have to work. I kinda need the money, even though the job sucks ass so bad. I met this guy, named Tim. He used to work in The Cage too, that's why he looked so familiar when the first time I saw him. He was a pretty fun guy to hang out with all morning. 

K, need to go to bed. I will be in the Cage til afternoon :(."

"event","I have been telling myself that this is not summer. Yesterday was pretty chilli and this morning is cold. Weather wise, I don't really complain too much. I have been working in <u>Batman 5</u> on and off. They call themselves <i>The Intimidation Game</i>, but at some point, there's no use to lie. It's a shitty job. I got paid minimum wage and have to stand up for 12 hours. Not fun. 

Yesterday I went to my Mother in law's house with Miqy and we just hung out. I asked her if she wanted to be my co-signer and she said she would. YEEHAA! Plus she has a friend who can help me with the INS shit I have to deal with. 

Yesterday was one of the greatest days in my life. I got my Marc Jacobs Stella and it's violet. It's really pretty for fall and winter. I got a co-signer for a loan. Marty, the realtor agent, told me that I got the apartment that Miqy and I really want!! That was really awesome. 

We saw this apartment on Wednesday. It is on west Haddon, between Western and Division. It's a really cool apt. It has two bedrooms, walk-in closet, walk-in kitchen pantry, built-in hutch, hardwood floors, dishwasher, pets are allowed, 1st floor, checkerboard bathroom tile, and the best part is, clawfoot tub!! I love clawfoot tub! This apt just like a dream come true. I still can't believe it how we got that apt. 

We saw 4 other apts, but not as good as this one. If you're looking for an apt around Wicker Park, Logan Square, and Ukranian Village, try North Clybourn Group. They are pretty good. They are not gonna take you to shitty apartment like Apartment People. Now I do not have to worry about apt anymore. We just need to start packing some stuff.

I have registered classes for fall. I am taking Camera Seminar with Diane!, Media Composer, Advanced Editing Seminar, and Human Sexuality Seminar. I still need one GE from Social Science. That sounds like a fun class. I have Saturday class though :(.

I think both of us are pretty much on the same page about my Mom. My Uncle apparently wants to ""talk"" to her. Yeah right, I can smell his plan from far away. 

Financially, I'm getting better. I should be able to register for fall semester soon. Hopefully this week. I've been picking up so many shifts in the Cage. I'm pretty sure that I am over the overtime limit. Well, there's always way to work around it. My sister sent way too much money too. That helps alot. another good news, Chuck from Warner Bros entertainment called me! I am gonna PA for <u>Batman 5</u>! Wait, the best part is, they're gonna pay me!! 

This week I need to take care some of INS shit. I wanna start filling out forms so I can get my working permit as soon as possible. I can really see myself working in Anthropologie, hee hee...."

"event","Wow, when the last time I wrote in here? First of all, I just wanna congratulate for all people who helped to get Federal Marriage Amendment lost in the Senate. Apparently signing petitions and writing emails to all those senators paid off. Now George Bush can kiss my yellow ass. 

Life has been up and down lately. It's ok but it's not great. I'm pissed at alot of people I guess this summer, and I have to give the- I'm pissed at you- award to my Mom. She frustrates me. I can't stand her. I really want to kick her big ass so bad. I'm at the point that if I don't talk to my Mom anymore, I don't give a shit. It's impossible not to get pissed after I talk to her.

I'm just tired that everytime we talk, she always talks about the same old shit. How my sister shouldn't get married so soon with Rod, how should I be careful with Miqy, why I want to be with Miqy, why Rod has no friends, it's ashamed that my sister wants to get married so soon, why our boyfriends are not attractive, how I shouldn't live together with Miqy, and the pity herself parade that I hate the most, and all I can think is, why don't you just shut the fuck up? 

All those questions are honestly, none of her business. If I want to be with Miqy,  that's my choice. If my sister wants to marry Rod and she's happy, that's her choice. Sometimes my Mom thinks just because she's our mother and she pays for our school, it means that she owns us. I'm sorry, but you don't own me. To be honest in my opinion, it's your choice to be a mother and what comes along with having a child, that's your responsibility. It's not a promise that you can own them later in the future. 

A mother is someone who supports you and trust me, I don't talk about financial support in here. She is too busy listening to other people than listening to her own daughters. She wants the best for us, but she defines the best by listening to other people and worries what other people think. She always tells people that she's a good mother and I don't deny that. She took care of me very well. However, if I want to be a mother, I won't be a mother like her. She's too busy to tell me what not to do and it's not very educative for me. The more she says no, the more that I don't have respect to what she says. There are more ways to teach people, rather than saying no. It's called compromise. 

So, she called me tonight and she talked about the same crap I mentioned above, and she pissed me off. She told me that she just wanted to exchange opinions and  she knows damn well already what my opinions are. If we are going to argue about this everytime we talk, then I rather not talk to her at all. I have more important things to do hmm...like, finishing school and looking for a job. Let me have my own goddamn life. Sometimes, I really want to be the ungrateful child so I can get my own Karma later, not that I believe that shit."

"event","I got back from New York on Friday morning and I felt a little bit sad leaving New York, but I missed Miqy sooooo bad. It was a good trip though, just not long enough. The first day I was there, I loved it already. It would be so crazy to live in New York and it will be too bold to live in Manhattan. Well, a girl can dream, can't she? 

My hotel was in Chinatown and to be honest, I never do like Chinatown. I mean, I like it cause everything is so cheap and you can just find about anything you want there. It's just too goddamn crowded. There were a lot of good chinese restaurants. SoHo was great and I loved the area so much and the shopping was great. I just hit the major spots like, Rockefeller Center, Union Square, Empire States Building, Madison Avenue, Central Park, and 5th Avenue. I wanted to go to Chelsea but I didn't get the time. I wanted to check out Williamsburg cause if I really move to New York, Miqy and I will probably live in that area in Brooklyn. 

New York is so diverse, you can just find any ethnicities you can think of. It's great, I like diversity but I was getting more racist remark more than anywhere else. Sometimes I forget that I'm an Asian, and it's still a surprise when someone reminds me that. You can call me out anything and I wouldn't give a fuck, but don't insult my identity. It is something that I can't change cause it's a part of who I am. I can't change my sex, I can't change my ethnicity, I can't change my sexual preference, I can't change where I was born, and I can't change my skin color. 

If I could choose my skin color, do I wanna be white? No, but living where I live right now, I would have more opportunity in my life. Skin color isn't really matter for me, cause I don't see people based on their color and then start putting stereotypes on them. I don't know why sometimes it's such a big deal to some people. 

It bugs me when people trying to call out a difference between me and them. They told me I have an accent, who really gives a fuck? Honestly, everybody has an accent. If a Texan goes to Louisiana, s/he would be consider have an accent and so is everywhere else, so don't get me shit because I came from another country. Sometimes they make fun of my english and I know my pronouciation sometimes isn't perfect, nor my grammar. Most people don't have perfect english anyway. They call me out because I'm easily an international student. Why don't you just shut the fuck up until you can speak 2 languages fluently? 

If you're not a minority then you don't know what is like and it's really easy to make a racist remark and not even knowing it. You might think it's funny, but it just shows how much close minded you are. You are busy making fun of the minority, spreading hate toward same sex marriage, exploiting oil in Alaska and don't even care what you have done to the environment there, ignoring the fact that Arnold, the governor of California, decided that all strays only have 3 days to put in the shelter and if no one comes to claim them after 3 days, they're gonna be put to death, and here you are feeling so good cause you consider yourself the majority. The truth is, you should be ashamed being an American right now. Your country is taking other people's job and killing thousands of innocent people/animal out there. Why don't you use your time to do something about it, until then, just shut the fuck up. 

Today I went to the Pride Parade and it was great. I haven't been to one since 2 years ago? The last one I went, when I was still in San Francisco. I forgot the feeling what is like to be there. When the parade started, I felt so happy and touched. I really almost cried. It was really amazing to realize that these people have been fighting so hard for their freedom and rights since 1969 in the Stonewall riots. It might seem that they gained their freedom, where homosexuals are more accepted right now. The truth, they are still fighting for their rights. 

There were people protesting against the parade and they brought banners saying that homosexual is a sin, marriage is a man and awoman.  You know what, killing thousands of innocent people is also a sin, but what do you care? Stopping two people in love, want to spend their life together, and gain the same rights is far more important of course. Gay people are the people who really should get married more than straight people.

I just don't understand how people don't get the idea of love, compassion, acceptance, and tolerance. I'm tired of being pushed around cause certain people slab stereotpyes on me, that I'm a minority and I'm weak. Some people would say, why did you come to America at the first place? The truth, I don't like living in Indonesia. I don't have a liberty to say what's in my mind and I feel so restricted with my own culture. I came to America cause I have a better opportunity to be who I am, but it doesn't mean I like it here. If could choose to be somewhere else, I would. Well, I am not gonna say it would be better than being in here, cause I don't know. The truth is, I will always face problems, no matter where I live and it's just up to me how I want to live and make a better life for myself and hopefully, someone else."

"event","I am going to New York tomorrow and yet I still haven't packed yet. Well, my flight isn't gonna be until 8pm and I don't work tomorrow. I still need to go to school to do my time sheet cause they are due when I'm in New York. I am excited but at the same time, I have my doubt that I could tackle everything I have planned when my cousin and I are there. I bought my tickets in priceline and no doubt that it was a good deal but the thing I don't like is, they don't tell your flight until you purchase the ticket. My flight is going to be at night and I just a little bit disappointed cause it means that I just lost half a day. If I could pick my own flight, I would pick an early flight. That way, I would have more time to explore Manhattan Island. 

Yesterday Mesa and I came up with this crazy schedule that we need to do each day we are there. We're just gonna hit the essential. I'm pretty satisfied with our schedule whether with the fact we're gonna strict follow it or bend it a little bit. My hotel is in downtown Soho, which I heard a very interesting place to see. I just can't wait to see China town. I bet it is huge. 

As much as excited I am, my emotional state right now is in the less happier place. I am just thinking how much you screw up when you screwed up. I know there is no such thing as forgive and forget. One can forgive, but not forget. Moving on is the more correct term. I know that everybody slips sometimes in their perfect little life, or the life that they want to be perfect. How far you can really move on? 

Sometimes I still bring back up old stuff but I know my limit and the other person limit. It's hard to move on and pretend like nothing happened, especially if you're the victim. I can understand that. I've been in that position quite a few times and it's not good, especially I bottle things up sometimes. How  can you really move on if you don't even talk about it, right? It is hard. 

Now I am the bad guy, but things had been talked through. Everything, and you're supposed to move on right? I hate with the fact that I thought everything was ok and I had a hard time to forgive myself, and now I just realised that the other person isn't really moving on. I don't like the fact that the stuff we agreed that it was cool, still brought up. I just hate that. It is just like a weapon to use against me everytime I screw up and the worst thing, I feel like I deserve to be punished for what I did. I talked myself through it, that just because I screwed up once, it doesn't mean that I deserve to be treated like shit. 

I don't think it will happen to me, but I just don't like about how insensitive he was. I made perfectly clear that I felt really bad and I had a hard time to forgive myself. He was the one who said he moved on and now he brought that shit back up? I didn't really appreciate that. Now I'm gonna go to NY tomorrow, I don't think this problem will be resolved. I just have to accept the fact that I screwed up and he has the right to remind me that whenever he wants it."

I'm a little bit pissed, especially that my flight will take off at night which I'll lose a day and back to Chicago early in the morning, which I will lose a day again. I only have 3 full days to hang out in New York. This is one of the reasons why I wanna choose my own flight. 

I need to get a New York travel book from the library and my feelings said that I have a huge fee I need to pay. I borrowed books that needed to be returned by May 17th and I just returned them yesterday. I think each day is either 10 or 25 cent. Do the math. 

Today probably I'm just gonna go to the library. I feel like I don't wanna leave the house, too tired but I need to hang out with my cousin and use the time well I can. Saturday I need to help Jason again, and he said it's gonna take all day. Oh Lord, why do I get into this kinda trouble? 

My cousin wants to go to Victoria's Secret. They're having a semi annual sale. I spent too much money in there but hey, how many times I go shopping in Victoria's Secret? 

Furry Friends said that they didn't get the application. I knew it! Well, I need to re-apply then. I'm just gonna apply by email so they can't miss it, unless I send it to the wrong address.

Surprising news, a burglar broke into my mom's house a few days ago and I think he couldn't find anything so he just took my mom's watch. I heard he went through all the stuff, including my old bedroom and made a complete mess. It's been known that burglary happens to an empty house, so my prediction is this guy had been watching my mom's house cause he knew that my mom lives by herself. My Mom hasn't got a replacement for her old housemaid. Thanks god that it didn't happen when my mom was inside the house. That would be terrible if something happened to her. 

The whole thing from this mess that made me angry was, a maid from across the street spotted this man went through the house gate but since she was so scared, she didn't call the police and nearby neighbor. Yes, she's scared something happened and she didn't call for help. Can you believe this bullshit? She's not anywhere inside my house, she's in her own house, away from the burglar and the burglar couldn't see her anyway. If I could go back to Indonesia just like a flick, I would kick her stupid ass and punch her in the nose. 

I know that she's not smart, that's why she's a maid but you don't have to be smart to call for help if you see a burglar. God, I can't believe she's a FUCKING IDIOT! What if my mom was inside? This is why before Indonesia likes to keep his nose in other people's business (is this the right expression?), educate your own people!! That's just the dumbest thing I've ever heard, wait, I think not as dumb as squeezing your cat and got pooped.

The night before Miqy left me and last night I broke up with him cause I wanted to be with one of my teachers (name is kept private), who is way, I mean WAY older than Miqy. The weird thing is, I have some admiration with this teacher and I had a crush on him when I was taking his class. Miqy told me it was normal, I mean the dream not the crush, and maybe subconciously I was afraid that we're not gonna work out. I don't feel like that way right now, but it makes sense. 

The trip to New York is getting more real everyday. I found a pretty good deal for my cousin and me. We're planning to go around June 21st for 5 days and 4 nights. Excited but now I have to work as many hours as possible before I go. I need the cash since everything is expensive there. 

I will work 'til 5 today and tomorrow I subtitute for Jimmy and Diane. I have to TA two production I classes from 12pm to 9:30pm basically. It will be boring but just have to hang in there. Think all the money. 

I haven't watched <u>Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban</u> cause Diane bought the tickets and she had family emergency, plus my cousin doesn't like Harry Potter. I have to wait 'til she goes home then. 

K, I need to TA now but just before I forget, the nicest thing someone ever told me and made me wanna cry

"event","It's 1 more day until my cousin will get here, yet it feels so goddamn long. Before she gets here, Miqy and I will just do some spring cleaning so our apt will look decent, plus it's a good motivation to clean our house anyway. I'm doing some massive laundry right now, since we only have two washers I have to do several rounds. 

I met Miqy after work yesterday and we went to <u>Anti-Cruelty Society</u>animal shelter to see some dogs. I didn't see any dogs that I really like. They always have cute puppies though, but I don't really want to have a puppy so I don't want to tempt myself. I was gonna pick up Diane from Union Station but I had 5 hours to kill, so we went to see <u>Mean Girls</u>. It was pretty good and the story was pretty twisted. We were gonna watch <u>Saved!</u> but it wasn't a matinee show. I went to Diesel and Urban Outfitters. I saw some things that I like, but I don't really have the money right now. 

I took the blue line to Clinton and got some direction problem. Diane called me and she was already outside Union Station. I met her on Jackson street and we took a cab to her new apt. For someone who just moved in, she was pretty neat. Some stuffs had already unpacked. It was a really good size apt for one person, and definitely a good price. I decided to spend the night at her place and I called Miqy. He sounded pretty sad knowing he would be sleeping alone, but I was just too tired to go home and I wanted to hang out with Diane. 

We went to Sheena and Jason's apt. They also got their new place in Southport. It was a really nice apt, again with good price. It made me really want to fine new apt soon. We ordered pizza and we watched a short film called <u>My Dirty Short Movie</u> and it was pretty weird. 5 people sitting around the table and they are having sex/orgy by saying what they're doing to the other person, like phone sex but it was face to face. Pretty awkward if I imagine that's happening in the real life. We watched <u>Queer As Folk</u> season 3 cause Diane hasn't watched it and we just watched until episode 2 cause it was already 2 in the morning. 

We figured there wasn't any Brown line running as well as Diversey bus, so we walked it. It wasn't so bad, it was just a little bit chilli. I slept pretty good in Diane's new bed with weird dream that I was in History of Cinema class. It seems that I can't escape from the class cause I am gonna TA for that class again this summer. Well, I signed up for it among Aesthetic and Production I&2 class. 

Saturday morning my cousin will get here and later that night I'm gonna take her to watch <u>Harry Potter and The Prisoner from Azkaban</u> with my friends. Whoever read this is welcome to come. We're gonna watch 10pm show in 600 N.Michigan theater. The thing is, I don't really know if my cousin likes Harry Potter. I've never heard she mentioned she likes it nor she doesn't like it. 

I'm still thinking about the whole trip to New York cause it will cost me quite amount of money, and I'm not at the best financial condition right now. My sister told me to go cause it's worth it plus take my cousin to other places. Maybe if we take the train it will save some money, but I don't wanna live in the shady hotel and the deal with the airfare plus hotel was a pretty good deal. 

Well, I need to put my clothes in the dryer and load some more in the washer plus I need to make something for dinner. Hungry! and Miqy is taking a nap right now. That poor guy was tired from 3 hours sleep last night."

"event","I've been wanting to write for about a week, but there was always something happenned that stopped me from writing. Whatever. My spring semester is done, thanks god. I don't think I can take that crap any longer. My cousin is gonna come next Friday and I'm so fuckin happy. It's just that her flight will get here at 5 frickin' in the morning. I'm planning to take her around Chicago, though I don't really know Chicago very well and it makes me miss San Francisco alot. I'm planning to take her to New York. I hope it will be a good getaway from Chicago and I'm just so excited to walk around New York City, just like an advanture. 

Last semester I had rough moments in my relationship. I had my first fight with Miqy but I learned from that, cause I've never had a fight with anyone close before. I just tried to deal with my feelings after the fight. I just couldn't understand how people said men things when they fight and they can just act like nothing happen afterwards. Well, we didn't say mean things to each other but it's certainly still felt weird afterward. There's nothing better than just accept it and move on with our life. 

My crush with B was pretty much over. I realized that it wasn't a good move to hang out with someone that I have a crush on while in the real life I have a husband. I didn't want him to think that I suddenly made a distant to him and ignored him cause we were kinda friends, so I told him that I liked him and it wasn't a good idea for me to hang out with him for a while. I mean it wasn't really such a big deal cause he was gonna go back to his hometown anyway. He was just said fine and that's it. I was kinda glad that he didn't act weird or whatever. I was pretty sure that he liked me too but I didn't need to hear the truth cause it wasn't gonna make any point. 

Last Thursday was the last day he was working in the Cage and he just left and didn't say goodbye or anything to me. He said he was gonna stop by later but he didn't. That was pissed me off. I didn't expect that I am someone special in his life, I truly didn't but I just thought that we were friends and he exactly knew how I felt about him and about he went home. He didn't wanna say goodbye personally to me, that's fine. No biggie, but the thing that I didn't like was he said yes he was gonna stop by and he didn't. I hate when someone makes a promise and then lie about it. If you don't mean it, don't say it. I'm not gonna fall apart just because you smash the truth to my face. Maybe you are not big with goodbye then tell me the truth. I'm glad that I had enough guts to tell you that I liked you, I just didn't know that you'd be such a jerk. I just have to say thank you. Because of that, you released me from all 'like' feelings that I had for you. I'm too tired to get that kinda crap from guys. 

Speaking about friends, for some reason I started to reconnecting with my friends in grade school, junior high, and high school through friendster. I don't really talk to them. It's just like they request and I accept, so I can have more friends in my list. One of them was my close friend in junior high. She tried to email me and we were talking through yahoo messenger. I have trouble reconnecting with these kind of old friends cause we haven't talked for years and it was pretty hard to catch up. She knows that I'm married and first she thought I was joking about it and then she asked about my sex life. We haven't talked for almost 7 years and you were asking about my sex life? Exactly. After that she was asking when I'm gonna have a baby, so I said I didn't have any plan to have a baby anytime soon. Then she reassured me that I wanted a baby later. She also told me when she knew I had a husband that I would get spoiled even more. Wow, was she a walking stereotypes. I don't deny that I'm spoiled right now, but even more? I don't have any recollection that I was a brat before. Oh well, little that I know about myself. 

I guess it's really inevitable to get all those stereotype questions cause where I grew up just have such a different culture. Sometimes I just don't get it why they could ask me questions that they asked me. I mean where I grew up is such a big city and they copy everything from here. Don't they learn something about women movement, which is not all women want to have babies after they're married or even they wanna get married ever, by choice.  I hate stereotype questions and it's so sad when my friends ask me that. 

If it came from a stranger then I could laugh bitterly. Speaking about stranger, I finally met an Indonesian in my school. This guy, either works or used to work in the Cage, out the blue came up to me and said he could speak Indonesian a little bit, so I asked what could he say and he said 'my name is...' and he told me that he was kidding cause actually he's an Indonesian. What kind of joke in the name of Jesus was that? That was so retarded. We talked a little bit and he asked about my sister. I told him that she worked in San Francisco. He asked if she has a greencard already and I told him no but she has a work visa right  now, then he told me I could be honest if my sister worked illegally, he wouldn't tell. That's another unfunny joke. First of all, he knows nothing about my sister. If my sister wanted to do illegal work, she wouldn't be bothered to go Berkeley at the first place. 

I just think that I have no luck with most Indonesian people I  met in here. I barely met Indonesian people that I can be friends with. I don't know why. Most of them are really fake. Everytime I met Indonesian in San Francisco, they were so eager to take me to the Church. No thanks. I don't have any desire either to make a group with Indonesian people in here. There's an organization for Indonesian students in here and I don't think I'll get along with them. I don't want to be sound snobbish but I don't want to make friends by force. I mean, just because we came from the same country, it doesn't mean that we have to be friends. I don't know, I just sound really anti-Indonesian. Maybe 80% of that statement is true, but the 20% is I just wanna have friends naturally, not because I think I belong to one particular community. My best friend in San Francisco in fact is Indonesian and she's a really good friend because we have some basic understanding, not because we're Indonesians to begin with. If  you wanna be my friend, there are things that you should never mentioned. First, don't throw some dumb or boring jokes that won't make anybody laugh. Second, don't try to convert me into any religious activity. Third, don't try to think that I belong to any community based on what you see in me. Last, don't throw any stereotypes shit to me, even though it's not about me.

"event","I've been slacking so bad this week. Oh well, I need to cause I'm amazingly exhausted. I finally sold my ibook to Dave, which increased my financial state from worse to better. I shopped a little bit and the rest I just used it for groceries and paid some bills. 

<p>This weekend Miqy got to borrow his Dad car, cause they are in Florida right now taking some vaccation. It's nice to have a car but apparently, parking around Belmont area is a bitch and Miqy is easily stressed out about this, which I can't do nothing about it. We went to IKEA though and we got for my porch and some chairs. Yesterday Diane, Jill, Sheena, and Jason came over. Miqy picked them up and it was so fucking hard to find a parking spot on Saturday night around here. Miqy was out there looking for a parking spot for almost an hour, which a little bit ruined the plan. Miqy was supposed to make tacos. I've never made tacos before and I know it should be pretty easy, but I'm so spoiled cause Miqy is the one who always cook. That was the first time I felt so helpless, which wa so stupid. I'm just really spoiled since I've been with Miqy. He practically take care everything from cooking to cleaning the bathroom. I told him not to spoil me and he can't help it. Now see, I can't even make tacos. Fianlly Jason, Sheena, and Jill helped me out cooking while Diane, was just looking up the internet.</p> 

<p>We played Cranium and it was really fun except that Sheena was in my team and she fell asleep. It was a fun night and I want to do it more often definitely. Jason and Sheena are going to move to Southport, so we will be pretty close this summer. Ow, ow , ow Diane is gonna see an apartment in west Diversy today and it sounds pretty promising and she can have pets! Diane is agree to take care of my dog until I move out from this stupid building, so by the time Diane moved in to her new apt, I can get a dog!!! Yay!!!!!!!</p>

<p>There's something that has been bothering me and I'm not sure if I should put it here but hey, what the hell. First of all, I  might write this with slightly exaggerration, so pleasseee....don't take it to deep.  I have a friend named, let's say B. He's my co-worker and he's been working there longer than I have. Everytime I saw him, I always thought that he's pretty cute and cool, kinda my type but not entirely. Last semester I got a job where he's working but we have never worked together before until this semester. I've never talked to him before and even though right now we're working together, we didn't really talk to each other until the last few times we were working together. 

<p>I always think he's kinda cute but until we started talking, he's actually nice and even though he's all American guy, he's sweet and pretty sensitive to certain subjects. The thing is, he's been flirting with  me and I know that flirting doesn't always mean something and I don't wanna be the only person who think it might mean something. However, I can just feel it and eyes don't lie, and yes, I'm flattered. Why is this happening after I'm married? I suddenly feel some guys are attracted to me and I might be able to get a date. Isn't that just horrible? 

<p>Don't get me wrong, I have no plan on cheating on Miqy. I just can't. The worst scenario that I would leave him for another guy but not cheating on him, which both of them are the worst. I just can't imagine why would I trade Miqy for someone else. Yes, it's horrible to admit that I have a little bit of crush with B, but I know he's not even half what Miqy is. Why bother, right? Easy to say, but I can't just ignore what I feel. I think most of the time, I misinterpret my own feelings. I adore some people. Yes, I think they are cute, nice, sweet, cool, and whatever, but it doesn't always mean I want to be with them cause for some reason it won't work the way I thought it would be. I learned my lesson. Some people just need to be left admired. I do want to be his friend, cause he's the kind of guy that would be cool to hang out with and we were kinda planning to hang out together. I am just afraid that this will be a disaster, but I should know myself better."

"event","Sometimes I forgot that I have a livejournal where I can just write crap. Well, I got my interview with Red Car this morning and it went well. Can I say they have a fucking awesome office! It's just like a super big loft with editing suites. In the middle of the office, they have couches and sofas for clients. They have this huge tv with playstation and a few controllers. The coolest thing is they have a drums set! How fucking cool is that?! Ok, control myself. The interview itself was really laid back. We just sat on the couch and talked. I talked to Michelle, Jarvis, and Zach. They're really nice and great to talk to. Apparently, I'm a little bit more advanced since they've never worked on film, hee hee... Yeah, it's all digital unfortunately, but absolutely not a bad place to start. I just finished made a thank you note for them. Zach said he would call me in a few days.

I indulged my shopping urge today. I got new purse, cargo pants, and shirt. I don't know if I wanna keep the purse, I think I will see about that later. I can always return it later anyway, as long as it's not a month yet. I really like the shirt and the pants. Oh, I went home and watched Friends season 4. I've been watching Friends and Freaks and Geeks lately, then I went to see Miqy at his work and we went to downtown again cause before I didn't get the chance to go to Papyrus to get some supplies for the Thank You note. I ended up shopping a little bit more. I bought new panties, thongs to be exact, cause my new pants is white and it's kinda see through. To be honest, I think I've been to honest so far, I don't like thongs cause it feels like I got a constant wedgie and I've never got a problem with panties line either, but I don't have white pants before and I just think it's kinda tacky to have panties line on white pants. So the thongs is worth to try. 

I didn't go edit again today so I have to do it tomorrow morning. I need to finish my Motion Graphics final project. My last project got into Motion Graphic festival, which I think pretty cool. My work's never got into any festival before. 

Yesterday I saw one of my old ghosts and it still looks the same. There was a little rendesvouz but it was nothing. I don't even know if I wanna see it again. Maybe I'll try. I'm in a different situation anyway now. 

Yesterday night was so fun. All assistant editor's girls went to Kasey's except for Jackie, and she's under 21 anyway. Somehow, I just had one round. I ate a lot of cheese though. It was definitely a good time. We're just talking about anything and planning to keep this as a routine every Thursday night. It sounds good, but I don't know about the money situation. 

K, gotta eat my tacos!"

I applied to Optimus, Red Car, Digital Kitchen, and Avenue Edit. Optimus sounds cool cause they pay their interns, but their internship is for credit so I have to pay for it. It's just like I have to pay for getting paid and I don't wanna pay for credit this summer. I'm kinda interested in Red Car cause they have an office in San Francisco. I think that's pretty cool. Well, I hope I will get it. 

I just got emailed from this girl, I think it's a girl, and she needs a camera operator. She will have some fashion show and she wants to film it. There's gonna be a fashion show and interview. I think that's pretty cool to have more experience and the coolest part is, they're gonna pay me 500 bucks! Finally, something that will earn money.

Finally I got that out of my way. I watched <u>Freaks and Geeks</u> all day today. I watched in the morning and we took a nap, finished the whole disc this afternoon and decided to take a shower and went to Intelligentsia to do my Tax. 

Miqy and I decided to take this wedding business more seriously, since he wants to have a small wedding party. I think I got sucked into that, cause now I want to have a wedding party too. Not a big one and not a formal one for sure. I bought this wedding planning book called <u>Bridal Bargains</u> by Denise and Alan Fields and it's very good since I know shitless about wedding and it told me how to manage a wedding party with realistic budget. The average wedding costs 20 grand and I don't have 20 grand, and I don't wanna spend that much money for a wedding party. That's just bullshit. 

I decided to design my own wedding dress. First, I really agaisnt white wedding dress, but white isn't so bad if I can mix it up with other colors and no long dress, no bows, no ruffles, no too much laces, and definitely no puffy sleeves. I bought this Brides magazine to get some ideas. I'm so new to this and I started thinking if I need a wedding planner, but do I really need one? It's just a small wedding party. This is just so much to handle. 

I have to agree with Ms. Sweetunknown cause I'm so crazy too about Sephora. I bought all my beauty care from them. Today Migy gave me a bottle of sugar cubes for bath from Fresh for easter. It smells really good. Most of the times I bought stuff that I don't really need. It's just so tempting.

I finally told my Mom what's going on and it seemed that she's not against it, but she's not happy either. There's no congratulations or excitement in her voice. Oh, is all my family are gonna act like this? Well, I guess I don't really need anyone to be excited cause it's me who want to do it, not anyone else. My Mom just worried if Miqy has STI or HIV. Thanks Mom, you know what's important. 

Do you know how people can think more than what it actually is? It happened to me a few weeks ago, but somehow now I have the feeling to write it. I went to a party of my friend and we just hung out and I started getting to know all his roommates. Not awesomely know each other but they seem a pretty laid back group of people. So a week or so later I met one of my friend's roommate on the school hallway and I gave him a hug. He told me that he felt uncomfortable with it, so I assumed that he's not a hugger and I understand that. Some people take sometimes to give or receive a hug. Then he told me it wasn't the problem, he's afraid someone might get jealous. From a hug? First of all, I know he has a girlfriend and he knows Miqy I think, cause I took him to the party. 

It just kills me when someone thinks more than what actually it is. Give me a break! it was a friendly hug, please put your ego somewhere else. Lighten up! I think people is too anxious to trust other people, til it's so hard to receive a friendly gesture without being suspicious about it. I'm just amazed that people like him does still exist. I hope he learns soon that not all girls think he's attractive and desirable to be asked to have an affair with."

Well, yesterday wasn't so bad cause I got my dresser, finally! Miqy is building it right now and we're gonna paint it pink and brown. That's a good combination plus orange. Yeah, I went to see Miqy's parents in the morning. We catched the Metra to Lisle. 

We went to this AA open meeting and I was trying so hard not to fall asleep. After that we went to eat pizza and guess who joined in? Miqy's brother and his wife. According to Miqy, his sister in law is could be a snotty bitch. I didn't really talk alot with them anyway. We went to IKEA together and his sister in law just gave an idea that we should have come over sometime for dinner. Hm...no thanks?

I went to work today and worked on my Assistant Editor project. Tina and I needed to fix it. I needed to match the MOS with the  master pix and Tina needed to fix the mistake that I did with the Sync Pix. I burned some files from the post production lab for my Motion Graphics I home work. 

For some reason, I'm craving to eat KFC. I know it's really bad, cause I have stopped eathing junk food. Well, KFC is ok once in a while but definitely no MacDonalds or Burger King whatsoever.

I was supposed to go to <u>Too Much Light Makes the Babies Go Blind</u> with a bunch of people from the Cage, but our dinner was prettly late, which there was no point to go cause we're just gonna be late. I heard it's pretty popular, so I assumed the tickets must go pretty quick as well.  Well, I can always see them next weekend. It just Miqy has been given me a good recommendation to see that. Begging, to be correct, to see that show again with me. 

Tomorrow we were supposed to go to IKEA to see some furnitures, but it just didn't work out. I thought Miqy changed his mind and decided not to go, so I made plan to hang out with Victor. I didn't know that he still wants to hang out with his Mom, so tomorrow he's just gonna hang out with his parents and I probably hang out with Victor. 

We're gonna start looking for some apts. I know we're not gonna move in 'til the end of August but it's just fun to see some apts, so we know what's our option. We went to Anti Cruelty and saw some dogs. They have some serious adorable puppies in there. There was one that I was really interested in, named Ben. He's an Akita Mix and he's just 4 months, still a pup. He's soooooo dan adorable. Let's see if he's still around by the time we move in to our new place. 

Spring Break starts from Monday, but I'm not gonna go anywhere. I work in the Cage everyday and I'm just gonna do home work and hang out with Miqy. 

Brennan and I started talking on Thursday and he casually talked about his relationship. I guess it's pretty surprised me, cause we didn't know each other that well. It wasn't like a casual talking about his gf. It's more like his doing a session with me how to handle his gf, which I think it was cool. I like to listen, and hopefully help, other people problems. I like to be the ears from time to time. 

Recently, I'm wondering about people that don't have the ability to communicate properly with other people. I mean, we live in a modern society, which a good pr is needed. I believe everybody has to have that skills. You don't have to be highly skilled, cause those what dirty politicians do. I'm talking about basic skill how to approach people. 

I was approached by a stranger who asked me if I was really married or not. I don't know him whatsoever. I was just thinking, what's your problem? There's no hi, no my name is bla bla bla, I know you from yada yada yada, nothing at all. It was just an absurd question. I'm not used to being asked about my personal life by people that I don't know at all. What bother me most, where did this guy learn his etiquette? Did his family or his society teach him how to communicate with other people? Did he even have a social relationship? It's surprised me how little people know about how to connect with other people. Maybe he was trying to be this mysterious guy, which just didn't work for me. I'm not gonna play charades with you, I'm married for cryin' out loud. Plus, there's a line between being mysterious and simply being nosy. 

One thing that he said came up pretty funny to me. He said, ""as i know all the frens are come from stranger."" That's literally what he said, btw. Well yes, I totally understand and agree with that concept. Friends were strangers once. I also know each people has different way to make a friend. They decide why this particular person can be their friend. As for me, a nosy stranger most likely won't be my friend. So no hard feelings, you're just not a friend material for me. 

I think that also made me realize how first impression is really important, not just in the looking for a job world. I mean, you don't have to impress anybody. You just need to be who you are, but there's certain way to be who you are and still please someone else. I've told you, pr. It's just how the way you put it.  

Ok, I'm gonna look at some apts in the Reader and watch <u>American Splendor</u>"

I feel a little bit relieve that next week is Spring Break, though I'm gonna spend most of my time working in the Cage and doing my homework. I wish I could something more special, but it never happened so far. I was thinking, should I go back to San Francisco? Yes, I'm gonna see my friends and my sister. I don't know, I would like to save the money for later.

It seems that Miqy and I need to save money for a lot of things. The first thing we need to save is money for moving into a new apt. My apt is fine but honestly, it's too small for both of us. We need bigger space. It seems that we are not gonna have a lot of trouble to find bigger space within our rent range. Pets allowed is a must. We have three cats and I'm gonna get a dog! I'm just so excited. It doesn't have to pitbull anymore. I don't think I wanna have a pug. I heard from some people that they often have breathing trouble, plus my sister said they shed more than cats. We already have one big furball at home. We went to Anti Cruelty Society and they have cute dogs and adorable pups! I want puppies!! They are just sooo cute, but I know, having a puppy requires a lot of time. I don't think I can afford it. 

The second thing, Miqy told me last night that he wanted to have a wedding party. Hmm, I thought I told him that there would be no party. Well, a small casual party is fine but Miqy wants something coordinated, more sophisticate than just serving chips and kegs. Well, if it makes him happy, then it won't be that bad. He wants to plan it from now. I think we need to talk sometimes soon about that and I just have to bear myself with his ideas. 

Yesterday I ditched my Editing 2 class and I went to meet Miqy and we went shopping for shoes. I got a new pair of slides and it's so cute. It's a reincarnation of last year Casadei. Miqy almost got it for our 3 months anniversary but since I've bought it, he has to work on something else. 

I'm satisfied with my relationship with Miqy. Our marriage is going great. Amber asked mem how is living with him. Apparently, it's not hard. I thought we were gonna get in each other's nerve. Yeah we do have hard times sometimes, but it's not something that we can't handle it. We're just a really emotional couple. We don't yell, we just cry. It's kinda silly and funny. 

I think tomorrow I'm gonna get my After Effects. Yay!! now I can do home work from home. I'm trying to sell my ibook notebook. I need the money for some of the plans I have with Miqy. Money is a tricky business."

This guy from Friendster asked me to submit my film  to Michigan Independent Film Festival. I think it's pretty cool, except I can't send it due to the fact I don't have the permit for all the songs I used. It's simply cause I've never thought I would ever sumbitted my film anywhere unless for school purpose, so I started looking for music composer. Eric and Miqy are gonna work on something, so I think it's pretty cool. I hope they will find something that can fit with my film. 

This after graduate thing, I have to get it straight. I need to start looking for intern during summer. I need to start doing research of production houses. I really really wanna go back to San Francisco. Well, not that desperate but yeah, eventually anytime soon.

I just bought a lot of movies from Half.com. The day before that, I got <u>Pirates of the Carribean</u>, <u>Maltese Falcon</u>, and <u>Laurel Canyon</u>. From Half.com  I got <u>It Happened One Night</u>, <u>Mystery Train</u>, <u>Night on Earth</u>, <u>Breathless</u>, and <u>Zoolander</u>. 

There's something that I wanna write in here, but I just lost it. Well, I'll get back to it, if I can remember."

"event","I saw <u>The Dreamers</u> last night. It was a goood movie. It was really beautiful. The ending was ambiguous but maybe it's better that way, cause I don't like sad endings, even though most films are great cause they have sad endings. It's just really weird. <u>The Dreamers</u> is the kind of film that could pull your emotion, weird feelings would get under your skin, and it would just linger there. 

Michael Pitt, once again, was giving a great performance. I always like him. He's not a big actor, but he can act and that's the most important thing after the fact that he's really cute. 

Tomorrow will be a busy day for me, following the day after, Saturday. Tomorrow I need to go to school in the morning. I need to do my Motion Graphics home work and Editing 2 home work. Motion Graphics will take more time to do than Editing 2. Then, I need to find Jill's birthday present and maybe Anne. I don't know what to give to Anne. She seems very practical and she doesn't like to shop for clothes, unless with her Mom. A gift certificate will do, but from where? Macy's? 

Jill will be happy with a Paul Frank stuff. Probably I will get her a shirt. She loves that monkey as much as I do. 

At night, I wanna go to Mark's performance. I need to call Joe to tell him that I will go. Who knows, he might want to pick me up. 

Saturday, I need to go to see the bicycles in the morning, then I have a hair cut appointmen at noon. In the afternoon, Miqy and I will go to see Rachel's performance in Second City. Later at night, go to Josh's party, which is Jill's b'day party. 

I need to go to the gym. I was gonna go yesterday, but didn't have the time. I'm glad it's almost weekend, even though I will have a busy one. It won't be that bad. 

I'll update later...."

"event","We all have problems and we can't avoid that. Problems with parents, relationships, school, money, and so on. But, do you think you have an excessive problem that you might need help? Well, leave out the drugs and booze. Who doesn't have a problem? I'm not trying to make myself feels better in here. 

I think I have a shopping problem. I'm afraid that it's getting out of hand. I know that I do shop a lot and I realize that I'm not good with handling money. I'm never good since I've felt that textury smooth with distinctive smell of paper in my hands. Sometimes I'm mad at myself cause I don't really appreciate for what I have. I take money for granted cause I've never really had to look for it. I spend my money like the U.S. spends their oil. It just keeps flowing. 

This -everyone has a problem- thoughts came when I was talking to my best friend in San Francisco. She has a relationship problem. Her boyfriend was steping over the fine line of what is a healthy relationship. She said that he has a problem but he doesn't want to admit it and always says that he's normal. What is normal anyway, right?

Then I started thinking about this excessive behavior of mine, and then I started thinking about all celebrities. I've been seeing the Fabulous Life tv show in VH1. I think those people have problems too with the way they're spending their money. They could spend $6300 just for a hair treatment or stay in a hotel for $4000 a night, or pay a private jet $3500 just to get the coffee she wants. That's just crazy and doesn't make any sense. Well, these people can afford it and I think if I had that much money, I would've not given a lot of thoughts of what I'm buying either. But, do they ever think how if one day they got broke? Would they be able to adjust their life style? 

I'm not as rich as celebrities, but not be able to go shopping is driving me crazy already. I want these Uggs so bad, and I don't have the money right now. I just can't stop thinking about it. I'm so mad at myself why I'm always pushing myself to do this over and over again? Why can't I stop myself? Do I really need a therapy, like a 12 step program? I don't want this sick behavior upset a certain people cause they can't provide me the lifestyle that I want. 

I'm not up to doing anything. I just wanna go home and bury myself underneath the blanket, tying to stop thinking about shopping. I wanna go shopping for shoes sooooo bad. I can't even believe how much money I have spent in this late 6 months. It is sick. 

Yafisa told me in her psychology class, a guest speaker came and she told the class that she used to spend money like crazy. She liked to go shopping and she owed the bank for 60 thousand dollars. She got helped and one of the treatment was to go to the church. Hm, why every treatment has to end up became religious? 

I think I need to start to do budget. I hate that, but I need to. For some reason, I don't have the feeling to go shopping anymore but I still want the Uggs. I know I don't really need them. It's almost summer and I just spent alot of money to catch up with my bills. Miqy still has to pay rent in his old place this March, so we're agree to split our rent evenly. I know he has his own money problem, cause he doesn't get a lot of profit like he used to from Kinko's and he still has to catch up with money after we'd gone to San Francisco. I don't wanna bother him with this thing and I don't wanna upset him for sure. 

I'm talking about this bad habits of mine and ironically, I just picked up a Lucky magazine, the bible for shopping. I just can't help myself. This is a bad sign, cause I'm planning to subscribe this magazine. The reason why I haven't, cause I'm just so scared it will encourage me to go shopping more than I already do. Oh, what the heck!"

"event","Ok, Miqy can't take days off for my spring break. I'm torn between staying in Chicago so I can hang out with him, or just going somewhere, preferably Mexico. My heart is more into going somewhere else this Spring Break. I really really wanna go to Mexico, and if no one wants to go with me, I don't mind going by myself. It would be a good experience. Well, I hope Victor is going back to Mexico. That would be more awesome. I called him last night and he told me he might go to New York. 

Anyhoo, I need to go to the gym. I haven't gone for a while. Maybe tomorrow I will take Miqy too cause he wants to sign up. 

I wanna go shopping, but I have to restrain myself for a while. 

There are lots of movies that I wanna see. <u>Dreamers, Monsters, Triplets of Belleville, Secret Window, 50 First Dates.</u>That's all I can think of right now. There might be other movies. 

I'm gonna work in the Cage soon. I don't know if the dweeb is working or not. Somehow, I wish he did so I could just ignore him all over again. 

Hopefully today Victor will come by to the Cage cause I do wanna hang out with him. I haven't hung out with him for a while. I do wanna hang out with Cody. I do wanna hang out with Diane. It seems that today I just wanna hang out with lots of people. Brennan's party? I don't know. I always like one on one communication. Let's see if I'm still in the mood. 

Last night I was renting <u>Harry Potter: Quiditch World Cup</u>. It's not the best game, but it's pretty fun. Damn the man who rent <u>Final Fantasy X and X-2</u>!"

"event","Kitty was sick yesterday. Miqy got home and later he found out that Kitty pissed the bed and just sat in the puddle of her pee. She couldn't even get up and her eyes were closed. Miqy took her to the vet and they said she had a fever and she might have a seizure. Oh, hopefully not! I know she's an old cat, she's 15 years old, but I don't wanna think she might not be around soon. That just breaks my heart. Now she's just lying on my bathroom's rug. She somewhat looks better. 

Last night Miqy and I were giving Kitty a bath. It was fun, cause I've never given my pet a bath before. She was being good too, not fighting too much. Now she smells like my Herbal Essence, cause Dominick's doesn't have pet shampoo.

Today I woke up at 1:30! I missed my editing slot and I'm just gonna try to scam tomorrow morning before I work in the Cage. I am trying to make more money, to support my shopping habbit. I'm still thinking about buying Uggs, but it's almost summer. Spring is not gonna be as cold as winter and when I was trying them on, it felt too warm. I would rather buy a cute pair of shoes to go with my dress that Miqy got me in Anthropologie. For this couple months, I just need to be smart with money, but my Mom will send me more money next month, and it will help alot!

Tonight Miqy will take me to eat Indian food!! Hmm...I can feel it in my tounge already. I thought I was gonna to Borders to do my home work, but alas, I'm not feeling going out in the cloudy day like today. Now I'm sitting in front of my computer with my Defend Joel shirt and black pantyhose. 

I don't know if I wanna go to Brennan's party tomorrow night. I mean, I probably know who might be there. All the people from the Cage. It will be nice if I just drop by and maybe do something else later with Miqy? I asked Diane if she wants to go, and she said she doesn't know. 

Guess, who's working on Saturday in the Cage? Yeah, that fucking dweeb. I just can't believe it after all this time, I'm so happy that I don't have the same schedule with him. Oh, just bear with it I guess. Yesterday we the most fun day I worked in the Cage. I didn't work, I was playing cards with Jimmy and Kevin. We were playing Texas Remi (have you ever heard of this game?) I think Thursdays might be the best day in the Cage cause Monday and Tuesday night, they are only three people who work. 

This new guy named Matt, he's pretty cool. I used to live in the same floor with him when I was living in the dorms. He just has this cool attitude and cool hair, hehe...

I was planning to go to Mexico this spring break with Miqy. I was just gonna buy tickets for both of us, but Kevin told me that we are still gonna be working in the Cage and besides that, Miqy said he couldn't take another days off since he just took one when we went to San Francisco. That's ashame cause I wanted to surprise him. 

***called Victor***

Well, victor just told me a cool place called Puerto Escondido. They have a great beach and not too many tourists over there. I might check that out later. I really really wanna go somewhere during spring break. I hate that I've never been anywhere. When I was in San Francisco, I've never taken a vacation with my friends. Well, now I'm in Chicago, the only vacation I have is going back to San Francisco. I wanna go somewhere else! 

K, I'm gonna check out about this Puerto Escondido. Wish me luck that I can persuade Miqy to take another day off!"

"event","Ok, I'm offcially sick. My nose is congested. I feel so bleh! and I have to go to work tomorrow and I still have night class. I just got back from dinner. We had sushi :). That makes me a little bit better, but what I'm craving the most is Indian food. I don't know why, since my first Indian food experience in Berkeley, I've been wanting Indian food so bad. There's an Indian buffet in Belmont. I will probably take Miqy when I get my pay check. 

Right now, we're gonna continue watching <u>The L Word</u>. I haven't watche the whole tape that we have recorded. Soooo many things that I would like to write right now, but I just don't have the strength to do it. I just want Friday right now. Well, weekend won't be weekend anymore since I'll probably be in school do my project."

"event","Valentine's Day was great. It was my first Valentine with someone that I truly care about, or you can say my significant other. My guess was right, Miqy took me to see ballet. We saw Joffrey Ballet in Rooselvelt Auditorium. It was more contemporary met victorian musical. I still like the show that I saw in San Francisco better. Nevertheless, it was a very eventful Valentine's Day for me. I told Miqy that I've never spent a Valentine's Day with a bf, I guess I will never have then, since Miqy is not my bf. 

I don't know why people make Valentine's Day such a big deal in here. Well, I guess it happens in Indonesia too, cause they just wanna be like American. Couple mostly assume that everything has to be romantic in Valentine's Day. Sex is one of the thing that has to be on the menu, cause it's the perfect opportunity to reincarnate <u>Bed of Roses</u> without being called cheesy, or time to try the sling just because it's Valentine. Well, I guess people have different motif why they wanna celebrate Valentine. There's a saying that Valentine is supposed to be everyday, but I don't think we're built with that kind of money and guts. Who has the money to shower the floor with rose petals and the endurance to sit on the sling everynight without worrying you will fall on your ass? Only Valentine's Day it is excuseable and the sling is back in the basement for another year. Oh, Mother Day doesn't count, btw. 

It's just weird and funny when we were in the auditorium, I was thinking how many of these couples would have sex? I was guessing 3/4 of them would. The gay guys probably wouldn't make it 'til home. 

Yesterday, I was having an unexpected surprise. I checked my friendster and my old friend from junior high was requesting me to be in his friends network. It just was so absurd, cause I haven't heard from him for a LONG time. We went through a lot of things when we were in junior high. I ditched class with him, I was there when he was high, we got caught ditching together, we hung out in class and made jokes of the teachers. It was heaven, and he quit school during/after freshman in high school, cause he got caught (I think) using drugs. I heard rumor that he went to Netherlands cause his mother lived there. 

I can't wait to see what he has to say about what he's been doing for the past....4/5 years! It was just amazing that he could find me in Friendster. The world is indeed small. 

I'm working in the Cage now and Dave just called me from the visual audio booth. He wants me to come by. He's probably bored as hell, so I will visit my brother now."

"event","I'm BROKE and I'm not fuckin kidding. I have debt in my checking right now that I have to pay right away, before it gets higher and higher because of the fee. I haven't paid for some of my bills. This is crazy. I hope next month my financial situation will get better after I get my paycheck, still though I have to pay those bills. This is frustrating. 

I have come to a decision that I need to tell my Mom as soon as possible that now I'm engaged (that's as far as she will know) and live together with Miqy. I don't wanna hide things, cause it's tiring and just so tedious. She has the right to know and she can complain but she can't do anything about it. This is my life, not hers. She doesn't like it, take it or leave it. 

I can't wait til Saturday, cause Miqy has a surprise for me. He's gonna take me somewhere, which I suspect is a ballet show. I'll love it if it really is. I've never celebrated Valentine's Day, cause everytime I had a bf, we've never got around that long. Well, I guess I will live up to my reputation then, cause I will never have a Valentine with a bf, I have a husband! Imagine things that I miss.

Tonight I think a little bit better, cause I only have to stay until 9pm, hopefully early than I expected. It seems that all teachers just jump right into the lecture. This is our first week, give us a break! 

Tomorrow is gonna be sunny! Well, still cold but it's better than this cloudy weather. I really need warm weather right now. Not a full blown summer, cause I'm pissed everytime I sweat like a pig. 

I wonder if I really have to socialize in my work place, cause I don't really join in to the conversations most of the time. It's not like I don't like them, I do like them. Most of them are nice (no, we're not gonna talk who wins the annoying or bitch award in here) to me, but I just don't feel engaged to the subject their talking about. I don't know, maybe it's just me. I don't feel like I need to socialize just because I work here, but I don't hate them either. Ok, just drop it. 

Well, I need to chek my cell, just in case Miqy sent me a message."

"event","Today we got the satelite! Yay! Now I can enjoy watching TV from my couchless living room. I can't wait to see <u>The L Word</u> again. I missed a couple shows. Now, I'm married, it's hard to say something without including the word 'we'. If I don't say we, it feels like I leave him out of my life. Then again, every story of my life cannot always start with the word 'we'. There's still an individualism living in me and I think I need to maintain it at certain level. 

Miqy bought tickets from ticketmaster, but I didn't know for what show. He said it's for Valentine's and he didn't wanna tell me until the D-day. I'm just a little bit curious. He said he would like me to be dressed nicely for this occasion, so I'm pretty sure it won't be like a rock and roll band kind of thing that we will go on Valentine's. My guess is, we're gonna watch ballet, cause he knows that I like watching ballet show. I just went twice, but I really really did like it. I'm excited just thinking about it. 

This is my second day of school in the first week. It went alright, I'm just tired working night shift two nights in a row. Yesterday, I felt like I had three classes. In the morning I was TA-ing for Sam Sanders for 4 hours, then I had my Editing 2 class for about 4 hours, and I worked in the Cage for 4 hours. It's just awfully long and it's goddamn Monday, but I forgive you Monday, in the name of money. Today I have to stay until 10 again in the Cage. I'm pretty glad that Miqy is willing to pick me up from work, it's kinda creepy in here when everything's already closed.  

I still have one more class that I haven't been into, which is assistant editor on Thursday night. That's my only night class. I'm not too excited about night class, but hopefully this class won't be so tedious in lecture. I'm interested in what I'm gonna be doing in that class. 

So, my plan for tomorrow is, I'm gonna TA in the morning. We're gonna have a tour to the Cage. Maybe another lecture in the class. I just don't know what I have to do in that class. I hope it's ok with Sam, if I'm doing my reading. It's 4 hours long for crying out loud. I can't wait until in class editing, so I can do my own shit. After TA-ing, I'm gonna go back home and head to the gym. I need it. Then, it's probably good if I can start doing my home work. I'm just sooo lazy to do this. I need to be more ORGANIZE this semester. Well, every semester I said that. 

I'm so bored, and I don't have any inspiration about what I wanna write in here. I'm just gonna go and hoping the time will be kind enough to move faster."

"event","I'm unbelieveably tired right now. I was just done helping Miqy moved in to my apt. Now it's official that we're living together. He is trying to unpack some of his stuff right now while my eyes are ready to shut down. I can't believe either that school will start tomorrow. I need more break, so I can stay at home and play Miqy's playstation 2. I've been wanting to play Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2. Probably can't do it tonight, too tired. Of course, at this moment my cats are fucking happy. There are a lot of boxes to climb and my living room is just like a labyrinth for them to explore. 

There are just some stuff that bother me and I don't even wanna talk about it. I will try really hard just to put it at the back of my mind and keep going with my life. I need to talk to my counselor as soon as possible about my future, if there is. School is making me depressed. I feel like I'm ready to find a job that will make enough money to pay rent and pay for food. 

Ah, forget about it. I just wanna take this problem slowly so I won't over stress. I start working tomorrow. I'm gonna TA for Sam's class at 9:30, I think. I need to pick up my schedule from the Cage. That fucking dweeb, Jeph Porter, does work in the Cage now. Thanks God, I don't have the same schedule with him. That'd be a nightmare, or a nice event to ignore him the whole time. 

There's not much to say unless I'm tired and also excited to live with Miqy. I know we're gonna run into problems, but we will figure things out together. I can consider myself very lucky. The thing right now, how to tell my Mom about this. She gave me a lecture about not to live together with your boyfriend. I know that I brought up in different culture, but it didn't even absorb to my head. I mean, I always have a different point of view since I lived in Indonesia. That's why America wasn't really a culture shock for me. 

Mom said that he could kick me out. Hello, I was here first and now, both our names are on the lease. He can't just kick me out like that. He's the one that has to move out if our relationship in a really bad situation. She told me that I have to think about other people too cause she still lives in Indonesia, and she doesn't live alone. So what? I can't even live my life the way I want it? Yes, I know we live with other people too. We're not alone, and as a person, I think I'm tolerant enough, but no one can tell me how should I live my life. If my Mom is ashamed with my life style, then don't tell anybody. Me, personally, I don't give a shit. She said that if we live together, it's just the same like being husband and wife. Well news flash, we already are! The funny thing that my Mom said it's illegal to live together with our bf. Illegal? Well, I live in the US and it's not in here. It's not even illegal in Indonesia for crying out loud. It is frown upon, but it's not illegal. It's like cops will bust in my apt and they wanna see our marriage license. If we don't have it then we're gonna be under arrest. Speaking about land of freedom, but then it's really misintepreted anyway."

"event","I'm back in the coldness of Chicago now. Unexpectedly, I adjust myself so quick with this harsh weather. The crazy thing is, now I remember how cheap the apt in Chicago, I feel like I would like to stay longer here. I'm just adjustable like that. Well, if I moved to Timbuktu, I don't think I would adjust that quick. 

Miqy has started packing his stuffs and he's planning to move them by Sunday. That just sounds crazy. I saw his stuffs and it's alot! I was supposed to help him packing his stuffs last night but I just couldn't do it. I didn't know where to start. It was just cluttered. This moving in business really got me. I think I'm just too worried about this. I'm sure it will be just fine. Yes, I'm gonna see him more than I'm expected, but hey, we're married. This is just the beginning. I like the part when I'm home and he just got back from somewhere or he's home and I just got back from somewhere. It's nice to see someone is already in the house. There's something sweet and cute about it. 

I think the actual biggest part in this is telling my Mom about it. I know that she freaks out just about anything, but boy was I wrong when one night, I told her that Miqy was spending the night with me. She didn't freak out about it. She still believed that I was still a virgin. I mean, how naive was that? Deep down, she might realized that I am not anymore. She just doesn't wanna talk about it and she'd rather playing dumb. 

Maybe she starts more being accepting. That's what I need her to be right now. Isn't it better if I just can be honest with her, than trying to hide it from her? I think it's because of our (Asian) culture, we're used to lying about our relationship to our parents. We just love that hide and seek game. I don't wanna play that game with my mom, especially about being with someone that I care the most. 

There's also a friend who doesn't understand about my relationship with Miqy. Well, first of all, she's a conservative. It's hard to grasp the meaning of relationship from my point of view. What does she know about being in relationship if she's never ever been in one? Yeah, you have this idea about what's an ideal relationship for you, but if you've never have one, then you don't know the truth from this theory that you have been applying in your head. 

It just bothers me when people think they know just because they think they know. Even you have been there done that, it doesn't mean your experience will apply to mine. It would be a good reference, but it wouldn't be a validation to follow your action. So if I said falling from a cliff hurt like hell, would you still wanna try it cause you think it'd be different with you? Of course not! What's the difference then if I said living with your bf wasn't a good idea cause they would have more the opportunity to use you? or what's the point of giving another guy a chance to enter your life cause they're just gonna hurt you, lie to you, manipulate you at the end?

It is a fucking huge different! First of all, everybody knows that falling from a cliff will hurt you like hell. It's a common knowledge. There's no common knowledge about loving someone. Yes, you don't date someone who slaps you. That's a fuckin common knowledge, but giving a guy a chance to enter your life, you won't know until you try it. Why? Because... every people is different! It's not fair to generalize guys just because most of them are assholes. You have to give every guy the same chance. Hm, I think that's why I ended up with so many assholes. But you know what? It's worth it, cause now I found the nice one who will be mine forever. It's taught me to be more appreciative, cause it's not everyday or even once in a blue moon I would meet a guy like Miqy. 

Once in a blue moon, when I was in San Francisco, I had this thought about my committment to Miqy. I know I'm just 21 and I don't know if Miqy would be the right guy for me. I mean, yes he's they guy that I've been wanting in my whole life, but maybe a guy like Miqy wasn't that rare in this whole wide world. What if I found another guy who's just as nice as Miqy in the future. Would I fall for him? Would I be sorry with my decision by getting committed so soon? Would I need more time to experience life on my own? It's scared me that I had that thought. I talked to him about this online. He seemed cool about it. He handled it very well. He said he would be sad to let me go, but if it was what I wanted then he wanted me to be happy. Hearing that made me wanted to cry already. Yes, yes, I'm getting weepy since I got into this relationship with him. I realized that I don't need someone else. Why would I want to be with someone else when I'd already have the guy that I've been looking for? It was just a phase and I hope, it will never come back to me again. 

Being committed is a scary thing to do cause our head is programmed with the question ""What if...?"" I'm just gonna say that, it is not an easy thing to do, you will always find a hard, difficult moments in your relationship, and what if questions will always be there, but if you know he's the one that you want to be with, then there's always a way to solve your fear together. When you go through hard times together, it will make your relationship grow stronger."

"event","Ok, the old chinese people were not that bad. The loud teenagers in the bus was so much worse. I miscalculated that. They were so crazy loud, I was wondering if they're on diet pills, cause my auntie got a ""little"" bit deaf after she'd started popping in diet pills. I mean, you don't need to talk that loud. If I was in the fifth row from the front and I could hear you, I'm sure that your friend who was sitting next to you, could hear you fine. Maybe they're think they're cool, and everybody should know what they're talking about. ""Yeah, I've finally beaten ARG's score in Mortal Kombat!!"" I'm sure a lot of people are interested in hanging out in game arcades and give a shit about people with 3 letters name. It might be you.

Anyway, I took Miqy to the airport today. I was a little bit sad and a little bit happy. It's a mixed feeling. I am sad cause there will be no cuddling at night for 3 nights (give me a break!). Actually, this trip wasn't really a trip for him. I mean, we had fun but we started thinking about the future more seriously. Sleeping in the not so bad hotel made us had more conversation about our feelings. Surprisingly, I was talking about my Dad more than I've ever told anyone. We were talking about how to handle our anger, if we have problems. It's not that we haven't handled it nicely, but I just don't want to be one of those couples who yell at each other when they're upset. It just scares me. 

First of all, yelling isn't gonna help. It won't make the situation better, just worse. Second of all, I've never got into a fight in a relationship. I don't know why. My first guess, I haven't got enough time to build a long term relationship. Second guess, when it got tough, I took off. I didn't have time to deal with it. So, from those two guesses, I don't really know how to handle the after fight. I don't know how those couples who yell at each other, using words that they might be regret afterwards, and still be together. 

I think it happens to everybody, but I just don't want it. I don't wanna say mean things because of anger to my significant other. It might hurt their feelings and you can't take back of what you have said. You could say that you're sorry, but it doesn't mean they're just gonna forget what they have heard. Deep down, they will wonder, if you have finally said the painful truth cause you're angry. So, I prefer the painful communication to talk things through to the painful swearing words.

I guess I used to be the kind of person who wasn't too open about my feelings, especially if it's about relationship. I was too busy covering them, so I wouldn't get hurt. Guess what? I still got hurt. Part of it, cause I wasn't honest about it. I just swallowed it down and piled up all my anger and emotion. It didn't work. I struggled alot and I was definitely thinking too much. I became suspicious and untrusting when it came to men. I tried to be idealist, and it was hard.

That's why when Miqy came along, it's kinda too good to be true, but I gave in. The mind game was tiring and nobody ever won. 

Sometimes it's hard to trust people when they don't give you what you want. Your mind starts wandering to every possible impossible questions. You ask your bf/gf if they love you and they say they do, and you ask how much and they can't answer. You will start thinking that they don't really serious about you. Come on people! What do you expect? You want your partner to love you more than their own life? Isn't it a little too much? How many lives you want? Your life isn't enough, you have to ask his? What's so much anyway? There's no way you can put that in words.

Stop creating ghost answers to questions that you don't get the answer you want. Maybe it is what it is. Maybe they have given you an answer but you are too busy to deny it. It happens to all of us. It's like lingering in one problem that has already solved. It's exactly when I was still an asshole magnet. I knew exactly what kind of guy he was, but I was still going out with him. I knew that I should have left him a long time ago, but I was giving him another chance, hoping that he would change. Deep down I knew, that it's never gonna happen, and still, I was going out with him. Or, I knew that he would never totally got over with his ex-gf, still I put myself into trouble and blamed him for being an asshole. Or, waiting for someone who was perpetually an asshole. You'll never get out of that, until you get back to the first answer you'd already had. 

Now, I already have a boyfriend, wait, make it a husband. There is a secure feeling that I don't have to deal with those crazy questions in my head. I know for sure that he's someone that I can rely on. I don't have those he likes me, he likes me not. Should I talk to him? Did he just wink at me? Should I wink back? Why didn't he call me? Where were him? Why I can't find a guy that's compatible. It's all gone and I'm so relieved.

Not until this afternoon, I was missing him and it was a really nice feeling to miss someone that much. Because, when you have something, you won't miss it until it's gone. It's not like I'm taking him for granted. I always appreciate that I have him, but it's just the way it is. You can't miss something, if it's not gone. Simple and it's the fact. 

My life pretty much is going in the same circle, now especially we're gonna move in together. It's kinda nice to know what's to expect. I like spontaneity, but there's nothing wrong with being predictable. I start to like it. It's nice to know someone's gonna pick you up from work, cook you dinner and occasional breakfast, make you coffee, be at home when you get back from work or class, hold your hands, kiss you passionately, and give me sex when I want it. 

It will be nice when I get back to Chicago. We're gonna start packing his stuff and I have to clean up my place. I need to call my landlord to ask for some space in the basement, so I can make more space for him in my apt. It will be intense cause I haven't lived with anyone before. Sharing bed and sharing life.

I'm getting sleepy and I don't wanna start writing weird language."

"event","OMG! I fuckin hate my life I wanna fuckin die.! People are fuckin stupid, immature, and too bitchy for me to handle. I swear why don't people just grow up! I dunno maybe I just was forced to mature faster than others and now people are just immature and stupid that i get pissed to the point where is just wanna fuckin slit their throats! Goodness I sound fuckin pyscho but I'm not usually like this but that's how bad it is. I do stupid shit to my body because these people. I wish someone would take a fuckin knife and stab me in the heart right NOW! I feel like shit all the time. My mom nd guidance counselor want me to start going to a professional counselor to try to help my problems and then get me on anti-depressants and do i need them! goodness i need them terribly but i dont need to go to a counselor to know that there is something seriously wrong with me. I think I'm Bi-Polar! I seriously think i am! I hate being depressed and pissed all the damn time. just every once in a while i will be in a happy mood but that is fuckin rare! I've basically lost all my CLOSE friends and then there are some people that are like all buddy buddy with me but really aren't my friends. I just don't really have anyone anymore. A LOT of my old friends from last year, we're not friends anymore and that sucks! But Oh Well I deserve it so whatever~ 

Well I'm going right now. This shit is getting me even more depressed then what i am now."

"event","This morning wasn't actually that bad. Most things were going smoothly except for the fact it was that time of the month. But besides that everything was fine most of the highschool went on a spanish feild trip so there wasn't many people there  luckily for me all the annoying bitches were gone until 6th period. Then in 7th period bitches wanted to start with me. I can't fuckin stand how immature people are these days. Then i get home and this damn computer of mine is bein a slow bitch. God I hope with everything i got that i get a new computer for Christmas. im almost positive I am but i dunno. Also i start talking to Martin and he keeps saying shit that is pissin me off when he already knows im pissed off but he was just playing around but didnt know when to stop.

Anyways, I am so afraid to talk to my mom about getting on anti-depressents! Not really afraid, I just know she's gunna be like ""Oh your fine, your just over exaggerating""! I can't stand it when she does that shit. But I am depressed most of the time and I can't take it. I hate how I'm always in a bad mood and i know everyone else is to. I want them to put me on the strongest shit they have. i need it. I just wanna somehow be in LaLa Land! Im tired of doing stupid shit to harm my body when im depressed. 

Other than that things are ok. My baby is movin back down here from Inverness. im so happy! I love him so much! 

there is a little drama with my best friend. She's pissed at me cuz i wont go to homecoming what kinda shit is that?

Oh well, im going to take a nap. Update more later!

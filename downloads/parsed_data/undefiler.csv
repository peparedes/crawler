"event","You can call me jaded, cynical, world-weary.

I say, I am only that way because I was once more fanciful, more idealistic, more &nbsp;hopeful than you are even now.

But I have had more dreams crushed than you have ever had.

I've spent my entire life reaching for my dreams and falling short.

And one can only fall so many times before something gets broken."

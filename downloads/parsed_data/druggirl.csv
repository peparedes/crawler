I never have these problems when I'm wearing old/not as loved clothes.  I'm gonna have to start wearing black jeans and t-shirts a la Slawomir and then I'm sure I'll get all the clean and tidy testing.  Of course, jeans and t-shirts don't fit the dress code, but that's too bad for them.

Crystal Violet is the worst dye to get out too.  Luckily I don't see any on my clothes, but I had an unfair fight with the test solution bottle and wasn't wearing gloves...  this stuff is a lot darker and more noticeable than my sharpie tattoo from a few weeks back."

It was fun & interesting, although I got a little lost on the way there.  If Google Maps was better at directions it wouldn't have been a problem, or if I realized the road I needed to get to was the one behind the mall, I wouldn't have gotten off where Google maps told me to, and and and.

Funny thing, a bunch of them recognized me from Ironman last July, and then a couple recognized me as a geocacher.  The geocaching recognition was the funny part.  Of course, my username is my real name, so it's pretty easy to recognize, but I got a laugh out of it."

Have a lead at a job at OSG Norwich Pharmaceuticals, close to Syracuse, closer to my sister, closer to a real place to live not in the sticks.

Anyway, it looks good, pretty much like new.  Unfortunately, they didn't have to repaint the one tiny chip in the paint that I'd have fixed under warranty again if I wanted to waste 2 months fighting with Burlington Hyundai.  I was hoping they'd have to blend that far up... guess not!  Ah well.  The work they did do (the work they were supposed to do) is perfect.  They had to do a few more things than the estimate, bringing the grand total up over $3000, but that's what insurance is for I suppose.  The $500 deductible still hurts though.

The one thing I really, truly adore when I have to bring the car in for major service is that the car always comes back waxed and cleaner than I could ever hope to get it inside and out.  I LOVE that."

<P>What else....</P>
<P>I picked up my mail from the post office today.&nbsp; Turns out when you go away for 3 weeks, a lot gets collected.&nbsp; I had a nice 6 inch stack.&nbsp; The bad thing about this is that the stack included a credit card bill that's due on Thursday.&nbsp; I paid it online tonight so hopefully it posts to the account in time!&nbsp; Just a word to the wise who are like me and refuse to pay variable bills through direct debit.</P>
<P>I also received a few presents from Jay, who I haven't talked to in the better part of a year.&nbsp; Very weird.&nbsp; Nothing too fancy/expensive, just a few books and a cd, and he also sent a card.&nbsp; I sent him nothing.&nbsp; I didn't know we were doing gift exchange.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure what to write him back - thank you obviously, but what do you say when you haven't had anything to say for a year?&nbsp; ""Dear Jay, Thanks, Yours truly, Rebecca"" seems a little weird, even though the whole thing is odd.</P>

<P>Got my year end raise too, I've been there long enough to get a real raise, yay!&nbsp; Last year I got a level up, which came with a small raise but that was just to bring me up to the lower end of the pay range for that level.&nbsp; I'm not sure my actual paycheck will go up very much (we'll find out on the 14th) but it's still quite exciting.</P>
<P>We had a group meeting today to go over some changes to our methods due to the new year we have new compendial method books - from the sounds of things, the lab manager is expecting to lose a lot of us this year.&nbsp; Not through layoffs, but attrition.&nbsp; Maybe I should start *seriously* looking too just in case.&nbsp; I'm just about at a level of experience that most not-quite-entry-level jobs are looking for.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I'm not one of the doomsday sayers who think the place is closing tomorrow but I've been wanting to move for a while.&nbsp; While the job is cushy (mostly easy but can be boring), the place has never really grown on me.&nbsp; I didn't want to be in this area, but I took the job because it was a job, and I needed it.&nbsp; I have a comfortable apartment in a town no one wants to come visit me in, because it's so far away from absolutely everything.&nbsp; I do so abhor moving though.&nbsp; Oh the problems!!</P>"

Looking back on this past few weeks I've made an inordinately large number of friends only posts in recent entries.  Fun fun.

Anyway.

On the plus side, three weeks without water seems to only have killed one plant that was struggling anyway.  And another one is questionable.  The others have come through beautifully.  And, I brought home 2 new plants so it's all status quo when the dead one and dying one get thrown out.

Methinks it's bedtime.  Early, but called for."

"event","Today has been one of the worst days of my young life/recent memory.

So, I'm back in Rouses Point now, after a 7 hour ordeal.  Should have been 2.5, but that's neither here nor there.

Next time my parents say, maybe you should think about staying another day and leaving tomorrow - I need to listen to them.  At least they got me out early in the day, otherwise it could have been a lot worse.

Got in a small accident on the way home today, then they closed the Northway, because of the freezing rain and lack of sand/salt trucks, so I had a 2 - 2.5 hour layover at the Valcour rest area, south of Plattsburgh.

My car, while driveable, is no longer shiny and pretty and new.  Well, it's still relatively new, but it doesn't look it.  

Got home, almost broke my neck bringing in Connor & cage, couldn't get the car in the driveway, put down 15 pounds of salt (all that I had), almost still couldn't get the car in the driveway, and now I'm back.  I have no food to speak of in the house, and it's damn cold in here - the heat still hasn't kicked in.  The majority of my belongings are in the car, as I had no desire to break my neck further to bring up Christmas presents or clean or dirty laundry or any of it.  Hopefully tomorrow I will be able to do that, and bring in food.  And buy massive quantities of salt & sand.  And probably studded tires, which I debated but figured, I made it without them last year, and I drive a mile to work.

It's a good thing tomorrow is a holiday (which of course is my standard day off from work anyhow).  Hopefully I'll be able to get at least some of this accomplished and get the car taken care of.  

So far, I have deleted 601 spam emails.  Three weeks away from Clarkson email and all it's glory come back to bite me in the ass.  Hooray!  I really should just have Outlook express stop collecting it, but I'm curious as to how long Clarkson will take to delete my account.  I only just lost my webspace after a year and a half, because I didn't remember my password to reset it.  Oh well.

Hopefully Geico wasn't lying in their ads that say their claim service is Fast and Fair."

I was originally going to go back here yesterday but I got a better offer.  Friends came up from MA to visit me.  We spent all day Sunday at Crossgates Mall.  How very fun!  Even though Byron got rained on and the Houlihan's mushrooms did not live up to someone's expectations.  (And the waiter was very nice and patient, I give him a huge amount of credit for that.)

I am in love with the Brookstone clerk.  And the massage chairs.

Connor was exceptionally nice all week, I had Mom take him out of the travel carrier and she was his best buddy the whole time we were there.  Now that I know the secret to having him be nice to others, I'll exploit that at Christmas too.  :-D"

I leave tomorrow and will be back Monday.  No telling how much I'll be online, so there's always email or my cell phone if you really miss me desparately.  My cell phone just got fresh batteries, and I unplugged it from its first charge at 6:30 this morning and it's still got a charge!  It's very exciting, it's at just above half charge now.  The old batteries would have been dead before I got home at 4:45 pm.

All right, bed now, then I get up, eat, finish packing, maybe scrub Connor's cage out, get the car loaded, get Connor to his vet appt, and then head home.

Safe travels if you're going anywhere this time around.  Tomorrow is the biggest travel day of the year, they tell me (although I would have thought Christmas would be), and by golly I'll be out there in it."

"event","Vices.  Everyone has 'em.  Some like toys that are battery operated, some, tools, computers, food, etc.  For me, it's Victoria's Secret (.com).  I tend to make massive purchases very infrequently, which is good and bad.  Good, because it's like Christmas when everything comes all at once.  Bad, because things tend to wear out all at the same time and I *have* to buy multiples of everything because as we all know, if you only have one pair of underwear, you have nothing to wear when that one is in the wash.  But I think I did pretty well.  I got two new pairs of pajamas, slippers, bras & underwear, a very nice shirt, and a bunch of promotions:  a 3 piece set of leather bags - shoulder bag, tote bag with wallet, and a weekender bag - which I could definitely use, and a fragrance sampler - which has potential for a very nice Christmas present for someone.  AND free shipping for purchases over $100!  I love free shipping.  

When I first got that VS credit card and the limit was over $100, I thought I'd never spend anything close to that at once, and it was pretty silly.  Well, now I have a little money and it turns out it was not so silly.  It's extremely easy to get $100 worth of items from that shop.  At least my obsession hasn't gone too far, and I do wear clothes/underwear other than from VS, but the brand has done such a good job of marketing itself that it's just so much nicer to have VS underwear when given the option, you know?  Damn good marketing people!!

Well, now that I have the buying stuff for myself out of the way for a while, I have Christmas presents to worry about.  I got my Christmas cards today at Borders, they were on sale and it's not even the day after Christmas yet!  Score for me :)  If I do not have your address and you think you're worthy of the greatness of Maurice Sendak and Picasso to put on your fridge for a few weeks, do let me know where the post office should be able to find you!

PS - I think I can officially say I have spent more time on the phone tonight than in the past two months.  How crazy is that?"

I figured out how to change wiper blades on this car, all by myself.  The winter wipers are now on.  The summer wiper fluid is out and the deicer winter fluid is in.  Put gas & dry-gas in the car.  The birds (outside birds) were fed - I bought another 25 lb bag of seed yesterday.  Worked on the baby afghan I'm making for my mom for her literacy volunteers student.  Washed (almost) every dish in the house.  Did most of the laundry, dumped the dead plants outside and washed out the pots.  Gave Connor a bath and cleaned his cage.  Made a cake, just for the hell of it.  Vacuumed.  Renewed my cell phone.  Entered a few giveaways.  Cut coupons from last Sunday's paper.  

Yesterday I finished reading ""Going Out"" by Scarlett Thomas.  Very very good book.  Next I'll probably start ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven""... my mom passed it on to me, along with ""The Lovely Bones"", since I lent them one.  Maybe I'll start that tonight too."

"event","Huzzah I'm cool.
No, not really. My friend has a greatest journal, and I like the livejournals better. This is my first entry.
I work at this cd store right? It's a pretty good place to work because it draws in a good crowd. Me and Arianna work there almost full time during the summer. She's a freshman in collage and I am taking 2 years off to study. Anyhow, this guy comes in and he looks like the lead singer of Rooney. He's wearing this...tan suit. I'm thinking ""Hmmm."" He reaches for an Oasis record, and a Spiderman lunchbox, along with Johnny The Homocidal Manic comics. Then he gets a powderpuff shirt. A Powderpuff shirt? Wow.
He claimed he was buying it for his little sister. And the lunchbox was for his boyfriend. I suck at gaydar. I really do.
My last boyfriend was gay. But no-Seth is not.

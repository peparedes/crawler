unforgotten, and unforseen
and though left in rememberent, a drawer
interuppted in an instant
then it's left behind, dark shadows in my mind
rain may weaken the medication of the mind
it will subside with all due time
as flowers must be as they please
free to flow with the birds in the breeze
we pick up these twigs and build a nest again. We'll wind up our mouths in pure and sane bright light
then lock the doors shut them closed
live in amber darkness"

memory. of what used to be
In these times great catastrophes call name on those who wait for the dawn, wait for the dew
the bright light of morning, never to see again the shades of what once was or will ever be, sanity. in mind, in heart in our places, we look down upon what once was. Those ill tempered mannerisms that discard the means for joy, and hate left within the scars of your mourn."

"event","But this is broken art,when the movement of the words.
the pages forsake those whoes eyes laid upon them,
Those that I shall not read,You told white lies,Where the black ink blots dripped on the page,
Trickling down your sleeves,
makes me want to be there to watch in reality as you take them,
bundled up and carefully packaged,
back down into my room,
where you sit on my bed,
and tell me again, twice I did not lie to you,
but I wont find where paper compromises your fate
and this candle I hold burns
when the wax drips down
savagley on hand.
Face with wax paper
cut outs made to fit your shape.Elusive mind. Shipwrecked on shore. Believe me when I tell you this
I did not see fit for where your right-hand fingers laid bright gold marks
onto her eyes
down with the handcrafted wooden cabinetry and the last blade of long grass
to ever cut this marked heart
where the mice and rats roam into my room and crawl upon my bedSearching through my drawers for anything useful or maybe something they lost,
Listen to the mice.
They tell me everything.
All the sunsets to have lit up your face
and all the summer air and burning portraits
 
empty with the heat, meaningful in the sun
to the place where the
butterflies and dragonflies dance in your head
 
but they fall down, from that placewith empty carcasses dried out beneath my foot I crushed
them,
 crumbling unknown and unseen
like bad dreams, awakening, but binding, like
gravity. Illustrations floating bound to fall
as I fall asleep the words come to mind
then float away leaving behind but a
Trace of light that disintegrates
into nothing   Eyes that are now rusted
look upon the faces that
burned dark holes
which drove me into this madness. Catatonicly and unfelt towards
the places I smashed those wine bottles to throw them straight at you with the rest of the broken glassand thought it was funny how Everything else is already broken
Maybe because I locked up already,In cages.
When they took me away that night This facade known so well to many others, but now
locked in this room, only bound to a single fitted sheet and very bound to not ever fall asleep, fed from a plastic glass
orange rays of light shining through the broken shades[not the sunlight], I wake to more tiny paper cups
filled with different substances I can not trace
broken to ease inthree men in grey suits greet me,
I thow my tray to the floor
to be taken away
then shut again in a green room where the lights come through the thick opaque glass I cannot seem to break
and she feeds me more from these tiny paper cups
and I fall asleep but awake into a dream
not able to speak before I think, and I don't know if
I am thinking [still, life] images
blurred in slow motion
because these tiny paper cups turning into paper cuts that mark my
head, bleed, with thoughts to fill that I cannot seem to find.
He glances but I cannot see straight,
please will you hold my blanket, so I can drift down the hall
to the shower
where I can stand nakedand silently scream and rest in this  sanity. Water rushing down my head
My head rushing
 pray to  God to be left alone, Where the tiles greet me name by name
Where the faucet can wash away the rest of this mess.
Take a seat, rest here
it wont be forever untill we're gone
out of [her]e... head
she's out of her head
dancing mystic in the haze, the fog I can't see through, unless that's a lightor was that just in my head.
And then to come
these dizzying city lights and traffic blazes by and I
can't see a thing standing around here
Just throw me in the water please
where I can breathye
You could pick me up when I fall down
cold air concious, untill we get back
slowly.
Broken back now, to a room with a crooked piano and another addict, to play me waltzes
So I dance, in a ruined way
can't find a bassline
can't find a bassline
and he[ looks back at me]
can't find a bassline..
[ Smiles through a few broken teeth]
The windows are locked like the doors with no knobs
I fix the bent paintings on the wall
native carved, I can hear the wolf howlingcausing my mind to shattersbut the pieces just fall back down
and so does this maddness
Suddlenly in a room with coloured sticks a life like television
a man with no head murmering obscenities to himself
Tiny puppets to a stop motion play in my head
Every day here, I can see them watching you, their minds know nothing.
and nothing is bad.
Piano hits bent notes and the wrong keysStill playing the foreground of my thought, every day here is hazey
blinding and burred. Sick and yet kind of beautiful
27 now, and I count the letters in my name
I think you took one.
The coffee is bad and cigarettes light up
the sunroom,  where the smoke blooms above me and the plants that sit, day by day, on an a-symetrical-tiled-table, where the colours don't match, and the pattern holds a disorganized inconsistantly that reminds me of a time, they don't seem  to mind when the rain trickles down the glass or being trapped insideor the company and the noise
 as the beds are wheeled down down the hall to a room with no view and locks that don't open
and as I count the paper cups fill that my head, binding my mind back to this, I realize, I'm in a very toxic place, and trapped here still, 32 nights and a broken telephone- Can't remember a single conversation, I lay on a hard bed next to a lady who whispers incessently things i cannot hear, where silver light dances through the curtain, untill she pulls it down, and thenin darknessI try to dream
 
With tiny foxes hiding on the paper canvas of a painting, like a book I wrote,
where the words kind of just float there
like a meaningless name
their red streaks remind me, of someone...I'd rather not
speak yet.Running across lines, chasing the papers as I flip through them and they fall to the ground like a meaningless name
And one afternoon, there were dried flowers. Heather and a maple leaf
fragrant and beautiful,
I picked it up, delicate leaves
I pick up the letters of my name, one by one, and place them backwards. Leaving.

"event","Hung over my eyes like wispy curtains tiny prisms dancing light They persude  me to the tiny note strings and beach comb the edge of a razor blade where i can dance to the music and words I can't read Notes carefully folded and perfectly creased it's cream colour collides with blue ink the perfect trace of a bottom lip I can relate the words back to where they came from the mountain tops all crumbling down unfolds to be reread 
I now have 3047 reasons to start running now and taste earths shy moss  with the soles of my feet celestial dancers share their word im 'fraid you're speaking to loudly to be heard in these tiny rings where mushrooms grow on a rainy day I can spot them all and drops like silent musings fall into my coffee and I bush my hand against damp fern leaves carefully parted beneath them I found essences.
 
Not too interested in talking now just watching the words that were improvised to invent some kind of story to make up for all this lost time They're un real & believeable  and I believe that the words will sell to you sign on the dotted line they're always on sale, shrewd and unused they told me that this kind of automatic writing would be good for you untill all the letters were used up and you could not write more
 
artful foxes so curiously blowing smoke up to towards your watchtower
where I wait  watching it dance their messages received by air like ticking watches that hang in the sky clouded by thought a tiny silver dolphin falls in my lap it's pin point reminds me not to get caught up in this day dream my small impression left for the world points to some part of my imagination blended together with reality
the paper gears stop to a hault in my head as the light in my eyes leaves me blind It's ethereal the harp notes this time they will be fallen and landed on my lap placed around me in circles that  spiraling downwhere seem to lead to nowhere.
 
cursed and unworn I dressed in them, and tied tiny knots where the fabric hung down over  a nakedness, drifting in the atmosphere and tied tighter still tiny threads were pulled and showed a lightness through  the rips of the seams, I was dressed in.
 
runaway train on a one track mind i jumped the horse on the rail road line drawn in. and I ran home cried because
every white horse was dead called out to you a useless breath, told me before to wait before you count the carts all lined up and ready with nowhere to go. You shot them down."

"event","neon light
reflected on the rains patterned
falling drops
onto black concrete
is the only way I see throughthe orange glare 
the darkness of tonight
And I breathe the mist that falls from the black sky
and wander
through the backalleys
like shortcuts through my mind
but that won't prove
the point
besides
it'd be pointless anyway;  
Like a paper crane
folded from waste
His paper wings
Sharp and new
so perfectly creased.
Flew so far away from me even when I told him nor to go.
They never listen anyway.  
and the nothingness in my bed room stands still
is hung on the walls
and through the open curtain
You can watch as it
Talks to me
in smoke blooms
lit up by a man, so venerable in his age
he blows his tobacco my direction
and from it's western Virginia barrel cured smell, I awake
and draw through the pipe
as
we talk through the ashes and
Listen to the
words that creep out of this old place
And from the several O rings he blew right
Through my heart that
surrounded us
They told stories in the smoke
Where I saw pictures
perfectly carved
into an image
Like totem poles, Then remembered
All the trees has died. 
And I realized that I'm just laying here in waste
Closed curtains
a floorboard open
was it a gift you left to me. 
and when I got up
walked to your room
tangled by all these webs from spiders
I figure you probably
trained
and just before they
meticulously bound my lips together
Make me say, that I somehow have changed
and just in the spaces where they left my mind open
you can fill in the blank.
Painted your wall were the two birds she said she liked. but one day  they just got up and flew away.  I can still see them nesting and it hurts.
 
In the early morning, bleu sky but it's covered  in shades of grey I go back to sleep and hold onto those images of the young girl in a hospital bed sending me some kind of cryptic messages can't wake, bad dreams churning untill they're nightmares through that one open floorboard they came creeping something
I had not seen before
the afflictions look the same
and could I not put name to the damper coldness,
coming through and
it drags me so far back
down
that I think only saints could bring me back from this place
 
There's men who speak in tongues and I listen while they sleep
a strangeness, too hard to translate
It's kind of disturbing the places where inspiration lacks morality
and I want nothing to do with this
or you that is which of the
very essence all these dreams come from
I never wanted anything
 
an empty room
With a broken window
ivory woman in a painted white dress
climbs through
there some kind of angelically made subtly schizophrenic by the very nature she was formed from white light with bright eyes, &dark lashes draped over some kind of psychic windows golden harps play   Porcelain limbs that   reach      out      to touch you. & take you dancing in the sky but when you reach back the limbs         just hang there&before you can touch her 
 
fall
 
to floor before you even touch, shatters to  a thousand pieces
 
tiny. white. shards.
kanolin, porcelana
 
and I have to put the fragments back together, my
 
un-forgotten nightmare. was supposed to be a dream But I think it's funny to dream. Don't I. All cut up now decomposing on the shelf. a piece of me, a part of my mind  left there  by someone i once knew
 
Just call it art and leave it at that.
 
I'll  breathe now and think and dream again once all these addictions have left me what do you think will be left behind Just the small things, like reasons sweet lies that can be tasted thrown into a glass by the door and I throw in a couple more, every time i leave this place consumed by each one  swallowed each bit and like the tiny pills that I cracked open spilled out the very essence thats at war with my mind  I can see through broken lenses, of  old cameras like film I'm unwound  looking through negative images, there are a certain few you can keep to yourself.
 
I wrote more than this but I can't find [so they told you,] where I left the pieces [so they told you,]or the note to say: read in between the lines. somewhere  and now they just  wander the tracks of my mind or maybe, I erased them forever [hah] but I don't see any reasons, why remember those were all just lies Try not to listen for any footsteps or you just might be surprised. 
 
Now take a moment to think of me now and everything you see but words can't touch me
 
I don't know why, but they  just follow me float in the air, and left behind me are the small trails of thoughts I had and the silence between them and the words from my mouth  is all you can hear like dew drops forming, or the soft notes that dance through my heartstrings pulled one by one  and played on, me  gentle needles
 
A broken mirror cracked  in the palm of my hand. it's points, so provocatively bleeding light in every direction now dance on the walls and illuminating cracks chase out the voodoo and devils because I'm just so much in fear  of what my mind will consecrate. 
I just wish I could go back to where the totems and the trees stand but then I remember all the trees are dead. and then I exhale,  and Wander through the dark back alleys that lead to perfect places for these pointless paper cranes fly back to meTheir creases old an worn unfold and then, re read  Some subtle thing I didn't notice before
 
Probably just a metaphor."

"event","into a tiny vial of 
liquid substance
tasteless odourless
clearalmost nothing. 
and through an opening
a crack
leaked into my skin
and made it's way into a space
in my mind
and filtered through the membrane
made tiny swirls 
unseen by anyone
now into the side of the surface I can feel a presence
where fractals appear, swiriling
in outer space
their iridescent shades
and still you try to look deeper, but can't find meaning
because the pattern's just the same.
 
and outside the fractal space 
tiny dots and rivets
make time-link creases
that run in rivers
on the palm of
a paper hand
And written inside, unfolded 
I notice
a word that spells your name
in indian ink
 
There's some eye in the sky that looks down on
a kind of dream-line walker
Swirling iris,
a deep black hole
and I want to swim inside the blackness
 bathe in the bits of white light that reach
the upside down images that dance
 in your minds eye
and franticly
make way to your brain
 
Where I spin it around
And then you see straight
 
looking further through time
desperation and contempation
Oh, I can feel it now.
Of what proportions 
can you tell
from the seas from sand
and where do you go
to find another
When I'm looking for comfort I go there
sometimes
And breathe nothing but salt mist in the air
where the wind brushes against my face
cool comfort for a moment
cold burnt sand on the bottom of my feet
and anemones shock the quick eel
and sitka evergreens shroud like shadows
I can still hear screams of coast, crashing sound never leaves
and it shakes me.
my ankles wrestling against the tide
I dip my fingers in
sweet green taste
 
 or is it all in my mind
 
I wonder as I walk on quickly past the white lines
 that can't hold me in
and the barricades
 that don't hold me back
 
Just a figment of my hallucination
 
Where the spinning fractals appear, leave a pleasant taste 
through and out of our mouths
and  dance 
to reach
each corner of my brain
and softens many harsh thoughts
until I realize
I'm high
and decide that
 it's faster if we just talk
 in colours
In them, the pattern goes on and on
but to remain the same
 
or is it just in my mind
 
I wonder as I walk on quickly past the white lines
 that can't hold me in
and the barricades
 that don't hold me back
moving backwards into time now
 
still feeling how the quiet rain
drawing stillness from my skin
seeps through my skull
reeling in
blends the colours
and causing 
the pastel shades
to form
serene images
that smell so sweet like
those places  you goand leaves a pleasant taste 
when the rain hits the 
 
glass I notice you 
quite often
see though
 
me
 
and let the colours 
of the watershine tiny prisms that 
blind you."

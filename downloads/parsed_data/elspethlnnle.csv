"event","Quand Mon Mari: 
(translated from the french)

When my husband comes home
The only payment I get is a beating.
He takes the ladle from the pot
And throws it at my head, 
I am afraid that he will kill me.
He is a false and jealous villain. 
He is a quarelsome, grumbling villain.
I am young and he is old. 


Come on. Can a song get any more awesome than that? They had class in the 16th century. Oh yes, oh yes they did."

"event","Yay. I am back from Maine, bearing a multitude of random blueberry related items that have pretty much no practical use (though, arguably more use than the moose hat i was considering getting for a certain lucky someone, because at least 99% of the blueberry things were edible...)


aaaaand now i have to help tina move into her apartment in Pennsylvania, so, i suppose i'll continue this update later O_o."

"event","So, at <lj user=lee_xingxian> 's request:  6 random facts about myself, and tag 6 people...

1)As a little kid, the one thing that I, the child that was afraid of everything (and i mean EVERYTHING--mosters, spiders, astronauts, you name it) was not afraid of were graphic acounts of serious medical problems or injuries.  Thus, while my sister would ask to hear scary stories, i would ask to hear a ""Get Hurt Story.""  Which basically meant that my mom had to repeatedly and routinely tell me about ""the time mommy's knee got split open and she had to get stitches"" or ""the time mommy's grandpa sliced his hand open with the lawnmower and had to be taken away in an ambulance,""  or ""the day daddy tried to fix the venetian blinds and they fell on his hand slicing open a vein and blood spurted everywhere.""  And i found this oddly amusing and even calming. Yeah, i was a bizzare child (but later thrilled when at age six I discovered the TV show ""Rescue 911."") 
 2). I loathe bannanas. I loathe anyone consuming a bannana in my general vicinity. I even loathe the word bannana--it is stupid and repetative sounding. But i do enjoy bannana bread.
3) I love Children's/YA fantasy books. In fact, I want to write Children's/YA fantasy books (and have several craptastic drafts on my computer which will probably never see the light of day again). 
4) Three was too long so i figured i'd split it up and start in on #4. So, YA fantasy: I am a rabid Robin Mckinley, Terri Windling and Sherwood Smith fan, and have a weakness for anything fairy tale related-- particularly retellings of the feminist persuasion. Oh, and i also am greatly intruiged by any fantasy NOT set in a magical version of medieval Europe...becuase that one has been done way, way, way too many times. Aaaaaand, i should shut up on this one before i get into my rant on how Fantasy Does Not Have To Be About Princesses And Dragons and Elves and Knights, because, well...It Doesn't!
5) Two of my favorite movies in the world are ""Ever After"" and ""Little Women."" I've seen both at least a hundred times since i was 13, and both can still make me cry.
6) I am (er, was) a closet ""America's Next Top Model"" fan. Trust me. It is daytime television GOLD.  Watch the reruns some time on VH1 and see for yourself.

As for the tagging 6 people, i don't really have anyone to tag who hasn't already been tagged O_o.  Cause before <lj user=Lee_Xingxian> tagged me i wasn't really using my LJ and thus didn't have many people friended. So...if you're reading this, and don't have me friended, friend me!! ^_^"

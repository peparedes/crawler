"event","so we got a new computer. well, ""new"" meaning chris' sister's old (ancient, really) computer. its slower than our old one (which i didnt think was possible) and it has WINDOWS 95 on it. yeah. so i cant download the software for my digi cam on here :( this is supposed to be a temporary solution until chris and his mom go half on a brand new computer at the end of the month but we'll see. i'm not holding my breath.

anyway. i hope everyone had a merry christmas! it <i>snowed</i> on christmas eve here which was awesome. not enough to stick to the roads or anything but it covered all the roofs and the grass and chris and i threw snowballs at eachother. i took lots of pictures because i'm a dork, but hey. at least i wasnt out in the parkinglot with my video camera like some of my neighbors ;)
calista turned 4 months on christmas. she seemed really interested and into it, as well. along with being mesmerised by the christmas tree she seemed to try really hard to get the wrapping paper off her presents and into her mouth. it was cute. she's become pretty coordinated over the past couple weeks and has started hitting the buttons on her toys without me helping her and she sings and babbles to herself all the time. oh yeah and she ""officially"" rolled over completely for the first time today, too! she'd been rolling over for a while but getting stuck on her arm (she only did it properly one time before that) and today she finally managed to get past her arm. :) i want to download all these pictures of her....she's SO CUTE.

i should probably go take a shower before calista wakes up. its good to be back. :)"

"event","well my computer is officially broken forever now. quite sad. i'm at my dads right now, looking up recipes and pilates stuff so i figured i might as well update while i'm here. 

its been awhile. things have been really, really good. calista is getting cuter by the second (i wish i would have thought to bring my camera over here!) and she's getting so big, too. i have no idea how much she weighs but i'm guessing its 15lbs or more. she'll be <b>4 months</b> on christmas. she loves standing up....thats all she wants to do. she hardly needs any help. she isnt laughing yet which is bugging me! but she makes little giggle noises when she grins. its the best grin, too, its like she smiles with her whole face. i love it. she LOVES her dad, too, its insane. chris doesnt even have to do anything...he'll just simply walk past her and her entire face lights up like a christmas tree. its really sweet. 
i also stopped breast feeding on thanksgiving. she was 3 months and i was just so tired of having engorged breasts and no pump and working 8 hours and coming home with exploding boobs. it was alot harder than i ever imagined it would be. and alot more painful...i ran a 101 fever for 2 days. yuck. calista likes formula alot better (i try not to be insulted) but they said she would so. i'm finally getting used to it.

anyway. things are good. christmas is coming up and i'm really excited for that. i just had holiday portraits done today and we'll probably go see santa sometime next week. :) yay. kids make the holidays so much more meaningful."

anyway she's sitting here on my lap drooling all over my boob and its time for her bath. i'm exausted so i'll leave you with a few pictures.

"event","oh man. please remind me to never, ever mention to people that my baby ""never fusses"" and ""is totally good all the time"". i am eating my words, people. EATING THEM. calista has been horribly fussy for the past 3 or 4 days and today is just the breaking point. she wont sleep. she wont be put down. she doesnt want to nurse. when i sit down she MUST stand up, there is no cuddling, no laying on her own, no bicycling her legs. she isnt having it. she wont suck on a pacifier, she has to have her thumb and since she's so un-coordinated it takes a while to get it in and of course that frustrates her, too. seriously. when chris came home today i handed her over, grabbed my keys and GOT THE HELL OUT OF THE HOUSE. 

man. i mean, theres only so much screaming one can take, right? i wish i knew what was wrong with her. isnt it too late to develope colic? if its like this one more day i'm calling the doctor."

"event","lately, alot of people have been telling me what an ""adorable little boy"" i have! i know all babies tend to look a little unisex during their early years but it baffles me because she's usually wearing something pink or a skirt or something. today we were at cvs (developing pictures!) and this old lady looks down at calista and says, ""oh what a big boy you've got there!"" now today is an exception because she's wearing a white onesie and a pair of jeans, but the jeans have flowers on them and she's wearing pink socks. but the lady IS pushing 90 so her vision may be compromised. anyway she goes on and on about how big ""he"" is and how all breastfed babies are fat and happy (how did she know i breastfed?) but as she was leaving, she waved and said, ""bye bye little fat boy!""

WHAT?!

she was such a prim little woman, and it just sounded so bizarre coming out of her mouth, and i couldnt help it...i just errupted into laughter. even the woman behind the photo counter couldnt help it and eventually joined me in my hysterical laughing (seriously, there were tears involved) but the woman <i>didnt even turn around!!!!</i> what? she wasnt even 3 feet away! she just kept pushing her tiny shopping cart towards the door. which was filled up with 2 giant bags of toilet paper, by the way. 
very strange.

also today calista has been fussy all day long. i hate when she gets like this, just fussing without a reason. i feel bad because she wants me to hold her and after 5 hours of holding the baby i'd really like to set her down to pee without hearing shrieking. and of course its friday, and chris works from 10am to 10pm. blah. right now she's content to bounce in her bouncer and suck on her thumb, thankgoodness, because i'm getting a little stressed over here. chris can not get home soon enough! and when he does i'm gonna go take a long, relaxing bath. its been a long time since i've indulged in something like that!!"

"event","voting day! my first election! was madness though. and i waited in line for EVER and i didnt even get a little sticker! wtf! ;)

today was also the first day of the ""winter"" season that it was actually below 80 degrees, and i dressed calista in long sleeves and pants for the first time! i watched her reaction carefully as we left to go to the grocery store and when the cold wind hit her face, lol, the poor girl didnt know what the hell happened. her little fists immediately went up around her head (she does this when she's surprised). eventually i think she even got to like it! i'm glad i dont live up north though...i would constantly worry about my baby freezing and all those extra blankets. although those baby ""eskimo"" jackets are the cutest things ever.

when calista was laying on her belly today, she lifted her head up and moved it from side to side for the first time!! :) so exciting! she also started singing today but chris swears she's been doing it around him for a few days. so i guess it was the first time i had heard it. kinda babbling i guess but LOUD. she's so sweet. she makes the cutest faces and sticks her tongue out all the time. 

i'm missing gilmore girls as we speak (type). it just feels like i have no time anymore to do frivolous things like watch tv anymore....i have laundry to do or an apartment to clean or errands to run or naps to take. i got so addicted to gilmore girls and (dont laugh) one tree hill when i was pregnant and now i have no time to watch them! oh well, i used to hate tv anyway.

calista really likes when i sing the theme song to gilmore girls to her though. she smiles all big and starts flailing her arms and kicking her legs all wildly. SHE IS SO DAMN CUTE.

i guess i'll go make dinner now before calista wakes up."

"event","i'm gonna try to update today with sompe pictures if i can get chris to hook up the scanner before he goes to work. i finally have some pictures of my bebe. i got paid today, too, and i'm going out and buying 2 disposable cameras. 2 weeks till my birthday....maybe chris will buy me a digital camera?

hint hint, baby. :D

calista has this weird looking redness underneath her head, on her neck. and it smells funny. i'm assuming its because her face is so fat her skin rubs together too much? i gave her a bath last night and its still there. it doesnt hurt her...i'm gonna try baby powder because i cant get ahold of her doctor. 
speaking of, her pediatrician sucks so bad. at calista's 2 month checkup i had to call her and remind her! of her own appointment! plus, her office is only open wednesdays and to make an appt, you have to call a completely different office. ugh.

i'm so tired and i want to go shopping for new clothes! but i think i'll take a nap first."

calista has been fussy all day. i cant get her to go to sleep! i think we're gonna go lay down together now.

"event","calista and i just got back from wic. i dont know what wic is like in other cities but OH MAN in my neighborhood its like the kids walk through that door and go balistic. they start throwing things and banging toys, running around screaming their bloody heads off. my daughter will <i>never</i> act that way in public! 
haha yeah right. ;)

but things are well with both of us. calista weighs 12lbs 2oz now (um did she gain nearly a pound in 2 days? crazy!) and she's 22inches long. she's in the 75th percentile for her age, so i guess thats good. and i need to lose 15lbs before i'm back down to my pre-preg weight. UGH. it sure doesnt feel like 15lbs, it feels like 30! i dont fit into ANY of my old clothes and my pant size went from an 8 to a 13. blahhhhhhhhhh.

OH in the wic office i had calista in her carrier and when they called me to go into the back, i stood up and picked her carrier up, too. well the handle wasnt completely pulled forward (so it didnt make that loud ass click) and my baby <i>almost fell out of her carrier onto the linoleum floor</i>. luckily i noticed right before she started sliding out, and seriously i was so shaken up that the nurse had to go get a box of tissues because i just couldnt stop crying! i felt awful. i still do. i know the fall would have been like, a whole 5 inches, but STILL. my poor girl. god i felt/feel like a idiot.

my insurance goes out this month. boo. i guess i've gotten everything taken care of though. my last doctors appt was last friday (i got an iud!) and the nurses were sweet and gave calista a teddy bear. lol it might sound lame but i'll really miss those ladies! and i went to my eye doctor and thats it. no more mooching off the government and spending all our hard earned tax dollars. or whatever it is that gets taken out of our paychecks for the government. i dont know.

does anyone else feel a little....slow now that they've had a kid? lol"

anyway work is awful. i hate waking up at 4am and leaving calista and being at work until noon or 1, and then coming home only to spend 3 hours with chris until he goes to work and being alone with the baby all day. i mean, i love spending time alone with calista, but it happens so often i would rather spend time as a family, you know? anyway then we go to bed at 9pm and chris doesnt get home until midnight. :( we have complete opposite schedules and i really miss my boyfriend. 
calista and i have fun though. she usually sleeps all day long with chris and is awake for most of the evening with me. her smiles are ADORABLE, oh man. she went to the pediatrician yesterday for her shots (finally) and i cried and cried. the poor girl. the pediatrician looked at me like i was crazy and i felt rather insulted. but anyway she weighs 11lbs and 4oz!!!!!!!!!! at 2 months. people always seemed surprised when i tell them how old she is. i dunno. hmm. maybe one day i'll actually get around to posting pictures!

anyway my computer has been broken for a while now. chris finally fixed it (yay for handy boyfriends who can fix shit) and i'm glad to see everyone is doing well. babies! woo :)

calista has been fabulous. she is such a good girl...she only cries when she's hungry or ready to be picked up. last night was the first night she cried for more than a minute and she really tested my patience...the child cried from midnight to 3am with little break in between screams but the poor thing had gas SO BAD it looked like someone blew up a balloon inside of her stomach. i was really worried but this morning it was a million times better. i hope that never happens again! no more formula for her until i stop bf! it made me so sad that i couldnt make it better right away. 
her one month bday was yesterday. ONE MONTH. it flew right by. all we do is hang out in the house and stuff because i'm afriad to take her places because she has no shots yet...can you believe her pediatrician is making us wait till the 2 month appt for her shots? i thought that was a little weird. its that pediatrix shot...i dunno. i want a new pediatrician again! 

i havent really been up to much, just hanging out with baby. chris convinced me to let his mom babysit while we went out on wednesday night to a bar with our friends. the adult interaction was really great and all but i missed my baby and had too much to drink (hence the formula feeding) and was hungover the next day. it really sucked and i couldnt feed her and my boobs almost exploded from all the milk. its just not worth it.

i'm going back to work in a week. :( and i really need a breastpump. i so want to go back to waiting tables (i never ever thought i'd miss waiting tables this much) but i'm not i'm going back to jamba juice (shame) as a manager. the ONLY reason i'm going back. for as long as i can take it (6 months max) then i'm going back to the restaurants. the sooner i go back, the sooner i can go back to school. which will be interesting with a baby. 

okay calista is getting fussy and i think its time for a boob."

"event","so yesterday was my one week checkup. all things are going well and my episiotomy is ""healing beautifully"" which is a relief, because up until thursday i was convinced i was getting an infection. the stitches dont hurt at all anymore, and i've stopped taking the pain medication. hopefully in another week things will be healed enough to start having sex again!

HAHA YEAH RIGHT.

speaking of sex, the dr. prescribed me 3 months of progesterone only birth control. did you know that it has <i>twice</i> the failure rate of regular birth control? scary. 

calista also went to the pediatrician today. her jaundice is slowly getting better. the weather has been such crap lately so sticking her infront of a window hasnt been working out too well. but she's not nearly as yellow. her umbilical cord also fell off today, praise the lord. i know i'm supposed to be sentimental about that and all, but for some reason it just FREAKED ME OUT. 

i still havent gotten any film developed yet (i know i know) but if you want to see a picture of her at one day old you can go to www.growingfamily.com and search by birthdate (8/25/04) and the password is zorbas. the pictures arent that great because we had to wake her up but still. :) one day soon i'll actually leave the freakin house and develop some film."

today calista is a week old. i want to cry. where did the time go? have we really been out of the hospital for 6 days? crazy. we go see the pediatrician on saturday and i'm anxious to see how much weight she's gained. she's having trouble fitting into her newborn pampers (which i loved--they had a little cut out for the umbilical cord) but from what i understand they only fit upto 8lbs? and today it FINALLY looks like her jaundice is getting a little better, which makes me feel alot better because i was getting paranoid about that. its so not fair that breastfed babies get jaundiced easier. our old pediatrician told me to supplement her on formula until it went away. um. i called the hospital and they told me that was un-neccesary. so we got a new pediatrician. ha!

speaking of breastfeeding, i am a milk machine. its crazy. some people leak milk after a few hours. me? i GUSH. its pretty messy.

last night i got up to feed her and change her diaper and guess what daddy did? put her previous diaper on backwards! lol i think its pretty hard changing her diaper the right way with her little legs kicking up a storm but putting it on backwards? now thats skill ;)"

"event","so i'm back from having my baby :)

tuesday morning chris and i woke up and decided to go out and spend the day at the park. we ate lunch and walked around all over the place, which we figured would be good for getting the baby moving. at this point i was four days overdue and we were getting a little frustrated. the night before i was having light contractions at exactly 5 minutes apart and we were a little bummed that they had stopped by the morning, too.
anyway we eventually got home and decided to give sex another go and sure enough, the contractions came back. they began at 10 minutes apart and 30 minutes later were down to 3 minutes. even though they were semi-light this scared me so i called the doctor. he told me to go to the hospital.
<lj-cut>we got there at exactly 6pm. they put me in a bed and hooked me up to the monitor and the contractions were still 3 minutes apart. i was only dilated to 3cm, and 50% effaced so they werent sure if they were gonna keep me or not. by 9pm i ended up getting the green light to stay, and they admitted me in and gave me an IV and all that good stuff. the nurse told me that if i wasnt dilated past 3cm in the morning they would hook me up to pitocin. 
6am came and unfortunately i was not dilated to a 4. i got the pitocin and right away i could feel my belly getting super hard and the monitor was showing some pretty long contractions but i wasnt feeling them. it was very odd. then the epidural man came in and asked me a bunch of questions about my health and started scaring me about my svt and telling me i ""might not be able to have an epidural"". later they hooked me up to an ekg and all was good, which was a huge relief because at 10am the doctor came in and broke my water (which felt SO weird!) and all of a sudden HOLY SHIT OHMYGOD i started feeling the contractions. i held out for about 30 minutes and after the nurse came in and told me i had dilated to 6cm, i told her to GET ME THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST. he was in the other room doing some other chick so i had to wait for a little bit, which was not fun. when he finally got in the room i was in pretty bad shape and shaking badly from all the pain, so he kept having to take breaks and wait for the contractions to stop. it took about 15 minutes and then it was over. it didnt hurt at all compared to the contractions, and i think the epidural is the best thing ever invented. whoever came up with this idea should be the wealthiest person alive and there should be a national epidural day to celebrate in their honor. lol i can not stress enough the love i have for the epidural. 
after that, it was great. the pitocin was up a little high so i ended up puking twice, which was kinda gross because it was all water (my father was in the room at the time and insisted on showing the nurse to ""make sure it was okay"" and she looked totally grossed out). then around 12:45 the nurse came in and announced that i was 9 1/2cm and that it was time to push!!! i was completely shocked and watched in total surprise as they dropped the end of the bed off, put me in stirrups and wheeled in the cart with all the stainless steel and shiny scissors and stuff (totally scary). my mom and chris held my legs back as i pushed and pushed and pushed. i didnt feel a thing, only tingles --which i assume would have felt like burning if i hadn't of had the epidural-- and when they were like, ""i see the head! she has hair!"" it hit me that this was it and i was gonna get this baby out of me, and soon! chris wheeled the mirror over so i could see the hair (even though i really didnt want to, he insisted) which was cool but freaky at the same time (who wants to see their shit all spread open and prepped with alcohol stuff and see hair INSIDE of them?!). the nurse was really great about helping me push, she counted for me and made me feel like i was actually getting somewhere, which was motivating. the doctor ended up using the vacuum though, and when he was doing that i heard snipping noises and i turned to my mom and said, ""whats that chopping noise?"" lol i should have known better, i was getting the episiotomy and she was like, ""its not chopping, sweetie"". and shortly after that, i felt like....a slithering thing coming out of me! and it was her. all i saw was a wet purple blur being taken away and she didnt even cry! not until they put her under the warmer and started wiping her off. everyone was crowded around so i couldnt even see her and it wasnt until about 5-7 minutes later that the nurse put her in my arms and she was awake and looking right at me. 
after 7 hours of (active) labor and 45 minutes of pushing, Calista Marie Blais was born on wednesday, august 25th, at 1:29pm. she was 7lbs 13oz and 20 1/2 inches long with apgars of  9 and 9. i am completely in baby love :D</lj-cut>

we've been home for about three days now and things are going really well so far. i decided to go ahead and give breast feeding a shot and its going alright. my main problem is that she latches on, sucks, then passes out after 5 or 10 minutes. then wants to eat an hour later! we're working on that though. i dont have any pictures up yet but you better believe when i do this journal is gonna be plastered full of them!!!!!! :)"

GOODBYE."" plus, every morning when we get up chris asks, ""are you gonna have the baby today?"" do i look fucking psychic?! man. 

not to sound totally stressed or anything, lol.

but i've made good use of my free time. yesterday i went shopping for a friends birthday, and got a pedicure and eyebrow wax. today i've tackled the laundry while flipping back and forth between the olympics and texans game. i'm trying to stay out of the nursery (which is completed, by the way. if i had pictures i'd post) because then i start fantasizing and getting all emotional. i want to meet my baby."

we talked about the non-stress testing and induction, too. i have to make a decision by next thursday --if i make it that long-- to see if i'd rather wait it out or be induced. he seemed pretty discouraged for me, but i'm trying not to take it as a bad sign because remember..this is also the same man that said i ""probably wouldnt make it to 40 weeks"". i should have known better to listen to a MAN about PREGNANCY.

i have to go pick her up from the airport at 6pm and its friday and there will be KILLER TRAFFIC JAMS on the toll road. wouldnt it suck if i suddenly went into labor and i was stuck in traffic? oh man. worst fear.

i had my dr. appt today. i am now officially <b>2</b>cm dialated, but still 50% effaced. which is good because she needs to wait until after 6pm tomorrow, which is when my mom gets here. i have a feeling after that its gonna seem like time has just STOPPED, you know? we'll see. my next dr. appt is the day before my due date! here's hoping i dont make it until then!!!!"

I AM SO READY.

today was my last day at work, thankfully. i've only been working 4 hour shifts for the past two weeks, and even working for 4 hours was killing me, which kinda bugs me to admit. it seriously felt like it was getting worse as the days passed...achey hips, tender feet, major pelvic bone pain. i dont think i could have done another day after this, so i'm relieved to be through. 6 weeks of non-working bliss! now its time to finish things up here. i really need to put the carseats in the car. i woke up this morning with what i *think* were contractions and my first thought was, ""ohmygod we're not ready yet!"" yeah. need to get some stuff done.

i have my 39wk check up on thursday and i'm interested to see if i've dialated any more. i think i've been losing bits of my mucous plug, but i'm not completely positive. it happened for a few days and i havent noticed anything today. i dunno. 

i think its time for a nap."

i just finished addressing baby announcements. now i'm washing baby blankets. 

i had this super vivid dream yesterday that my water broke when i was going to the bathroom, and when i stood up my mucous plug FELL out of me onto the floor. it looked like bloody snot, which is what mine looked like, minus the blood. it doesnt have to have blood, right?

things feel like they've been flying by recently. 2 weeks just passed in the blink of an eye....where has the time gone? (btw--i havent been able to update lately because as i was leaning over the desk to hook up the scanner my HUGE BELLY knocked over a glass of water onto the keyboard. ha ha.) i cant believe i'm 38 weeks pregnant. it just amazes me. 

i had a doctors appt today, and it was standing room only in the waiting room. lots of familiar faces--everyone is gearing up to have their kids in the next few weeks. there's this one lady who sounds EXACTLY like fran drescher and she's been there for the past few weeks, talking loudly on her cellphone...today she was talking about ABORTIONS and her ""medical history"" which had to do with STDs. so annoying--i hate when people talk on their cellphones and make their conversations the center of attention. whatever. i seriously felt like clapping when her name was called.
ANYWAY he started checking me for dialation last week, and there was nothing. wasnt even effaced. sooo disapointed; i was SURE i was dialated. and today i was 50% effaced and 1cm dialated! woohoo! :) and he said he could *feel the baby's head* which made chris vow that there will be no more sex until after the big day (lets see how long that one lasts). he says i'll probably have her before the 20th!!! ahhhhhhhh!!!

other than that, things are great. my blood pressure is super low, i'm measuring right on the money and i've gained 35 pounds (totally proud of myself--i celebrated today by eating a butterfinger hahah). I AM SO READY TO HAVE HER ITS CRAZY. i keep wandering into her closet and marveling at all the tiny baby clothes and into her room to look at the crib. we still need to call the pediatrician (yeah i feel so guilty about this) and put the carseats in the cars. my last day of work is the 10th. :)

here is a picture of my 37 week belly because i havent taken a 38 week one yet. they basically look the same. do you see all my stretch marks???? stupid cocoa butter didnt do shit. :P

"event","i keep reading all these birth stories in the pregnant community about labors that go from like, 5cm to 9cm in 5 minutes and they have no time for an epidural and end up pushing the baby out naturally. which, to me, is really scary and is one of my ""worst labor fears"" (along with having the umbilical cord strangle the baby, the umbilical cord squirting stuff on me when it gets cut, ripping, etc). i want my epidural! i can not imagine going through labor without any sort of pain relief, and i dont care how much of a wuss it makes me sound like!! yet i have no fear of them inserting a huge needle into my SPINAL CORD!

my baby is moving around like crazy. this morning it felt like she tried to push her knee (or hand?) through my belly. it actually didnt feel that great! maybe she's getting stronger :) she's been wiggling around all morning and its kind of nice but i have RUN OUT OF ROOM in there for her (my uterus ends like, right where my bra begins!!) so its also kind of uncomfortable.

"event","just got back from the dr's office. it seems like every time i go in there he's delivering a baby and it takes forever for him to get back. seriously. its like the 5th time in a row i've had to wait for like, 2 hours.
ugh. anyway.
i'm 36 weeks now (yay!) and i got my papers. those were fun to look at, i apparently had alcohol in my system at my 1st dr's visit!!! thats what it said, anyway, and i'm kinda curious to know why since i havent had a drink since i found out, thankyouverymuch! i'll ask him about it next week. i also tested negative for group b strep (thankgod) and i start getting tested for dialation next week. i wanted to know today but oh well. he also told me that he doesnt deliver at any other hospital besides christus and katy, and I AM NOT HAVING MY BABY AT KATY HOSPITAL. i'm so upset. i'm calling my amerigroup back and raising hell tomrorrow. 

so i took my birthing classes yesterday. which were...interesting...the lady who teaches them looks just like martha stewart. we watched a video from back in the 80's (arent they all?) and got to see a baby crowning. and a placenta being born. well, coming through the vagina anyway. IT WAS REALLY GROSS.
we also did the fun breathing exercises and other little warm ups. kegal excercise (i seriously never thought i'd be in a room full of 5 couples doing kegals with them) and the tennis ball massage and other relaxation techniques. it was alright. 
although i must say i was pretty shocked at the amount of people who didnt know all the basics of labor and delivery--these people were in their 30's and clueless about epidurals and other basic stuff. its like they never even read a book or anything!"

"event","so i packed the hospital bag today. i went to target and bought travel sized soaps and shampoo and stuff...for some reason i think mini sized toiletries are so cute, heh. i also bought <lj-cut text=""these birth announcements""><img src=""http://img71.photobucket.com/albums/v216/theena21/announcement.jpg""></lj-cut> which i've been eyeing since i was 4 months pregnant. i'm really glad they still had them. 
i also boiled pacifiers today, which, oddly enough made me feel more motherly than anything i've gone through in this whole entire pregnancy. hmm.

so i called my medicaid and amerigroup and they basically told me there is nothing i can do whatsoever. so i have to change hospitals. i'm super bummed out but i'm trying not to dwell on the fact too much and just make a good decision. i can basically choose between 3 hospitals my ob will deliver at. i'm taking a tour of memorial herman hospital's ob ward on wednesday, where i was born! i'm also taking my birthing classes there...chris' mother signed me up for a class, too, and since she's paying, i canceled the 9 to 5 one and now chris and i are going once a week for 3 weeks from 7 to 9. which is fine. 

i also noticed today that i'm getting the lovely stretchmarks. right smack dab in the middle of my tummy. they havent gotten big yet, but i have a feeling they might get pretty dramatic. i knew this day was coming, and i know i've earned my ""tiger stripes"" but somehow i cant help feeling a little disapointed. goodbye bikini!"

"event","i had my drs visit today, the one for the group b strep test. it wasnt that fun. it seemed like he spent more time with the q-tip in the butt more than in my, well, you know. 
anyway before hand the nurse told me to get undressed, so i did. i took everything off and got under the sheet, and the doctor walks in and is like, ""whoa, whoa, you didnt have to take your shirt off!"" (not like i was sitting there with my breasts exposed, but whatever) and he asked if i wanted him to leave the room so i could put it back on. i'm like, ""um, i dont care, whatever"" at the same time chris is saying, ""yeah, yes, okay"" lol. this time he didnt stay in the room to witness the festivities, though. at the first visit he was pretty traumatized--he walked out saying, ""i could never be a woman"". 

anyway the dr. told me i had a urinary tract infection, which was news to me. i dont have any of the symptoms (THANK GOD) but he gave me medicine anyway. and even worse than a urinary tract infection, he told me that <b>the hospital i am/was planning to have my baby at has dropped my insurance this month</b>.
ISNT THAT FUCKING GREAT?
i'm on state insurance (medicaid) and my pcp is amerigroup. the only reason i chose them as my pcp is for the simple fact that christus st. catherine accepted them! otherwise i would have gone with a much better provider and had my baby at a normal hospital. but i am in love with christus, its a beautiful hospital and they have a birthing center with private rooms and baby room-in (which was the main reason for having her there). its very swank, if i do say so myself. i'm absolutely crushed. tomorrow i will call medicaid and beg to get switched over to ""traditional"" (the only type of medicaid christus accepts) but if i remember correctly, they dont accept pre-existing conditions. 

i'm so upset. :(

but other than that, things are okay. the baby's heartbeat was 150bpm, she's head down still, blood pressure is low and i only gained 1 pound, putting me at a total gain of 31 pounds so far. now its weekly visits to the dr's office, and next week i get my ""walking papers"". we still need to clean out the cars, put in the carseats and pack the bags. 

its getting pretty real, people! :D"

this is by far the most painful thing i have experienced in this pregnancy. 
its only happened twice, and both times i seriously thought i was going into labor. once it was at 4am and i couldnt even stand up, and today it was at work. it wasnt really like, stabbing knives in the belly or anything just major painful crampy feelings and my belly was hard as a rock. kinda like the ""WATCH OUT I GOTTA GO POOP <B>NOW</B>"" feeling, but without the poop. braxton hicks = paaaaiinnn.

yesterday i finally got around to organizing all the bebe's clothes into piles of newborn and 0-3mos, 3-6mos, 6-9mos etc. etc. it was kinda overwhelming, but now i have neatly organized stacks of onesies, pants, shirts etc. all in monthly order. 
we put the crib together last night, too. well i shouldnt say 'we' because chris did most of it, but i handed him tools and stuff, lol. but i really like it and i want to go buy the bedset NOW and make the room all pretty. i have all these decorating ideas but no money. :( sad. 

oh yeah we found a hospital thats not completely booked on childbirth classes, and surprisingly its not all the way on the other side of houston, its only like 15 miles away!! major plus. but this is not a plus--its a one day class from 9am to 5pm! a cram class, lol. it teaches the lamaze method of breathing which i guess i'm kinda interested to learn, but dont think i'll really use, because i'm getting an epidural. its on the 31st, and i'll be <i>26 weeks pregnant</i> by then!!! eeeeee!! :D"

i'm really anxious to start organizing the babies room, but we havent set the crib up yet, and everything is just thrown in there, so i have no idea where to begin. i also thought we would be okay without a dresser for the baby, just put all her clothes in the closet, but as we aquire more and more outfits i'm beginning to re-think that decision. we have clothes pouring out of the bassinet, piles of clothes overflowing out of a hamper, and outfits on hangers hanging in various places in the room and in MY closet! so yeah, i think we need a dresser. maybe one with a changing table on top (another thing we thought we didnt need..)? maybe i'm just freaking out because we're getting so close to d-day and i have this habit of wanting everything to be perfect. i dunno. but i definitely think we need a dresser.

things we need:
1. dresser
2. safety stuff
3. crib set
4. more baby blankets 
5. diaper bag
6. rubbing alcohol (i can not forget this!)

in other news, the baby has found my ribs and is kicking the crap out of them. more like she's running her feet up and down them, or maybe her butt is just pressed up against them, because there really are no more ""kicks"", it all feels more like rolling, or poking. i'm keeping an eye out for the outline of a little foot or hand."

"event","my doctors visit was fine, as usual. measured me, we listened to the heart beat (135bpm) and he smooshed my tummy to feel where she was--still head down. good, i hope she stays that way. for once i didnt gain any weight at all, still at 30 pounds, (thankyou, treadmill) and we went over some birthing questions about monitoring and what to do when the water breaks and all that good stuff. i have my step test on the 15th, and i'm not really looking forward to that. why didnt anyone tell me they have to STICK THE Q-TIP UP YOUR BUTT?!?!!!!!! i was shocked to find this out. great.

so its july now and there are only 38 more days until i can quit my awful job!! :D i'm starting to sort of feel ready to get this pregnancy over with. 

Ten Things I Am Looking Forward to:
1. meeting my daughter!!!!
2. seeing things from the waist down again!
3. being able to bend over, tie my shoes, touch my toes, etc.
4. feeling like i can breathe.
5. having a glass of wine.
6. doing it on my back!
7. being able to change the litterbox (i know, i know but chris doesnt do it right and i'm completely anal about it)
8. NO HEARTBURN!!!
9. wearing belts again, and pants with a zipper.
10. having my body back, somewhat. 

Ten Things I Will Miss:
1. my big pregnant belly.
2. feeling her move around. 
3. taking weekly pictures of my belly.
4. the nurses at my OB's office.
5. people randomly being nice to me because i'm pregnant.
6. always getting to ride shotgun in other people's cars.
7. relating with other pregnant women.
8. strangely, the anticipation of the baby coming.
9. reading all the pregnancy books and websites.
10. the constant foot and back rubs!"

(thanks to <lj user=""betty_bites""> for showing me how to do this!)

i need some more maternity clothes. i didnt have that many outfits to begin with, about 5 pairs of pants and 5 shirts, but my dryer is so hot that it like, melted the threads in one of my tanktops and the straps fell off (more evidence that maternity clothes are cheaply made!) and my other tanktop got stained, so i put bleach on it and forgot about it. the bleach <i>ate holes</i> through the cotton. so i'm down to three shirts, one that is now too small anyway. UGH. i really hate spending 20 dollars on a top.

i have a doctors appt. tomorrow and i cant remember if its for my strep test or not. hmm."

"event","i'm starting to get to the point where i'm basically freaking out about having a baby. i went this whole pregnancy feeling pretty secure with our ability to have a baby and i think when 30 weeks rolled around it became alot more...real, i guess. now, nothing is good enough. we dont have enough money. yesterday i sat chris down and went on and on about my worries until he was probably about ready to lock me in the closet, but he did make me feel a little better about things. atleast our ability to raise kids. the money thing, well. we'll probably never have enough money in my opinion, lol.

i dunno. its scary being responsible for someone. 

lately i've been scrambling to find a birthing class that will let me sign up this late. i really wanted to do them but couldnt afford it and truthfully, i'm really not that nervous about labor. i've read tons and tons of books on the subject and it doesnt seem easy or anything, i just think i've prepared myself pretty well. 
but chris' mom seems to think that i need them so she's paying. whatever. i'm sure they'll be interesting and informative, and it'll be good for chris, i'm sure. i hope they dont make me watch a video of a birth though...that could possibly change the whole, ""not that nervous about labor"" thing, lol.

"event","i went to the cardiologist today (finally!) to have the irregular heartbeat thing checked out. had the ekg done and went through a barrage of questions and he concluded that everything was normal. which i pretty much figured was...but i still wanted to be sure that my heart is pumping enough blood to my baby etc. etc. but all is well. yay. :) 

today my cravings have been OUT OF CONTROL. earlier today i had to eat a hot dog. then (thanks to <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/geekymary/"">her!</a>) i had a craving for chocolate shake and fries. later on in the afternoon i was talking to a friend about ben & jerry's OATMEAL COOKIE ICE CREAM (i dunno, i think this only sounds good because i'm pregnant) and i really, really, really want that. i'd even settle for oatmeal cookies. mmmmmmm. then we started talking about bennegans and their southwestern egg rolls and pineapple dipping sauce...i think i'm going to bennegans tomorrow, lol.

speaking of pineapples, i was reading somewhere that the size of a baby at 32 weeks is the size of a small pineapple. i was in the produce department yesterday buying strawberries (another pregnancy craving) and i almost bought one. i cant imagine something that big being in my stomach right now. crazy.

this is gross:
i was laying in bed today taking a nap and i woke up choking on acid reflux. TWICE. isnt that nice? another lovely thing to add to the list of ""the joys of being pregnant"" ;)"

"event","i had my dr.'s appt yesterday, and once again i got the weight gain lecture. i have gained exactly 30 pounds so far. and i have 9 or so weeks to go, with ""5 pounds left to gain"". he's really stressing the fact that he doesnt want to do an emergency c-section, and he thinks i should go walking every night and he gave me a peice of paper with a diet plan for 2000 calories. now, personally, i think this is a little overboard. the diet plan thing, i mean. my diet already consists of moderately healthy things, with a splurdge here and there. for a while, i wasnt doing too well, but in my opinion i've been eating pretty damn healthy for atleast 9 or 10 weeks now. 
the walking thing, on the other hand, may be a good idea. i stopped going to the treadmill at about 20 or 22 weeks after i hurt my back somehow and could hardly move for a few days. it would be good not only for weight regulation, but supposedly its also good for labor and helping the baby ""engage"" or something like that. 
i just feel like he's stressing the weight thing for a more cosmetic approach. in the beginning of my pregnancy he prescribed something to me for the pimples i was getting due to my raging hormones, and i thought that was a little frivolous; it had nothing to do with anything. it wasnt hurting anyone. and bitch and moan as i might have done, they went away on their own a few weeks later, anyway.
i guess i shouldnt be so pissy about this subject, because studies show that weight gain over 40 pounds does put you at an increased risk for an emergency c-section and we all know its possible to gain 10 pounds in 9 weeks. shit, i gained 7 pounds in 4!! but 1) i'm not even THAT big (i can still hide my pregnancy with teeshirts and according to almost everyone else's opinion on how a 7 month pregnant person should look, anyway), my baby isnt very big either, and my blood pressure is always normal, if not low. 
but the doctor is just looking out for my saftey and the health of my baby, so i guess i'll just go back to the damn treadmill. screw the 2000 calorie diet though. i'm going to continue eating the way i have been and just stop the little ""splurdges"" all together. no more smoothies or bowls of broccoli cheese soup. :(

that was long, lol. but for real, it bugged me how he gave me that diet plan. 

other than that he said everything was great. my blood pressure has been excellent, except for once when it was borderline high (but i think chris and i were arguing on the way to the doctor) and in one month my visits will become every week. i have 2 more visits before they become EVERY WEEK!!!!!!!! surely that means that its time to have this baby! and not at this next visit, but the one after that, i'll get my group b strep test done, yay. i think i'll be 35 weeks.
i also asked the doctor to tell me how she was positioned and he squished and poked my belly (which was really un-comfortable) and told me that she was head down, and pretty small. which i kind of thought (her ultrasound said she was in the 36th% for her weight) but her kicks and punches arent that light or anything, lol. she actually woke me up for the first time last night going nuts in my belly! i also asked him about another ultrasound and he said i probably wasnt going to get another one since everything was going so well. chris wants to go get a 3-D ultrasound but i'm not willing to pay 100 dollars. besides, we'll have her in 9 SHORT WEEKS anyway. amazing. :)"

"event","this morning i was laying in bed, looking at my stomach and i noticed it was drastically slanted. this isnt the only time i've noticed this, but this one time in particular looked really weird. i'm guessing she just likes to hang out in one corner of my belly? i dunno. does this happen to anyone else?? 
she's always really active in the mornings (or whenever i wake up, be it morning or afternoon), too. lately its been feeling like she's kicking and punching at the same time. in rapid succession. it actually feels like she's having a seizure in there, lol, but i know that cant be it so i'm assuming thats what she's doing. i wish my belly was see through.

here is a picture of me today, at 31 weeks.

"event","damn, last week was hell.

recently, chris and i have been looking for a new place to live. a 2 bedroom place to live, to be more exact, because the tiny little one bedroom apartment we were living in was just ridiculous, even for us. we really needed room for the baby. so after searching every apartment guide known to man, talking to realtors and scouring for apartment specials, we decided to just transfer our lease into a 2 bedroom in this complex. which is okay, i guess. its only another year, right? and its better than waiting until our lease was up in august, as i would be 9 months pregnant and probably not in the best of spirits.
so this all seemed like a great idea, but then we figured out the catch. we had 2 days to get out. <i>2 days</i>. we had 2 days to get 2 years worth of stuff out of one apartment and move it downstairs, over 200 feet, and upstairs again, into the house. i felt really bad for chris and his friend, because of course, all i could do was pack and unpack and move little shit. 
it was not fun. the first day we started at 3pm, and it was about 90 degrees outside. the second day, it rained allllll day. it was a miserable experience. come to think about it, i'm actually kinda glad we're not moving for another year. 
i'm so excited to have a nursery, though. :) we went and picked up our crib and matress yesterday and i cant wait until chris puts it together. the babies room is still a disaster (our whole apartment is still a disaster, actually) but its taking shape. 

oh yeah and somewhere in all the hectic moving mess my baby turned 30 weeks! 30 WEEKS HOLY SHIT. 10 more weeks. i'm starting to get a little scared/antsy/impatient/nervous. 
i'd post a picture of my belly but we still havent got the scanner hooked up and tomorrow is 31 weeks anyway...but suffice to say i'm fucking huge. i dont know how it happened. i think i've gained 30 pounds now (ugh) but thats not according to the doctors scale. so we'll see on thursday. and so far, i'm feeling pretty good. my feet hurt constantly and the heartburn is an everyday thing i'm learning to live with (sadly, there is no more spicy food for me) but other than that we're all good. oh yeah, my hips are sore. which doesnt feel like a good sign, lol. maybe i'm having a growth spurt? and the baby (we really need to decide on a name for her) is kicking everyday all the time! i think i got my first kick in the ribs a few days ago and DAMN it hurt. it hasnt happened since, but i'm pretty sure thats what it was. 

whew. and thats where i've been. now its time to go be productive."

"event","recently when people make comments about my pregnancy, they've been saying two things i really hate.

1) ""oh, you've still got a LONG way to go!"" in response to my being due in august. yeah. NOT REALLY. 2 months (well, a little more than that i guess) may seem like a long time to a seasoned pro but holy shit its <b>2 MONTHS</b>!!!!!!!!! do i look really pregnant or something? i dont get it. 

and:

2) ""and its only gonna get worse!"" in response to me saying something like, ""yeah i have killer heartburn"" or ""ohmygod i have to pee <i>again</i>"". thanks for the negativity, bitches.

how irritating."

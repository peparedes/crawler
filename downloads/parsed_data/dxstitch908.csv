"event","while filling up one of the burets in front of lab class, i accidentally spilled quite a bit of HCl (strong acid) all over my hands. like an idiot i rinsed it for a few seconds, and continued on titrating NaOH with HCl. nearing the end of class, i can see that my left hand looked all red. so i rinsed it for about 5 mins and proceeded with classes. 
Mondays 4:25pm - 7:00pm (usually it's trig hw time. i could only do trig hw at school. at home it just stares at me. sometimes i put my physio text book over it, and be like ""ha! i can't see you now!"")

everything about it is awesome.
driving new cars make me nervous i guess. my palms get all sweaty, i can feel a shorten of breath, making me feel lighthead. sometimes i felt like crashing into something. I always have at least a bottle of gatorade or water by me just in case these symptoms come up

oh went to jumbo's clown room for the first time. my eyes and me enjoyed it. Even though they weren't nude, they were all pretty and talented.

the atmosphere was comforting. i was amazed by the number of ladies audiences and how the guys were not that creepy.  

the middle eastern man next to me put his 1 dollar billss neatly in a stack. earlier i see people just pull it out of their wallets. i put my mine ready in my pocket so it would be a SUPRISE! 

They all make it rain! 

one of the dancers said to me (as she was grabbing her winnings) ""awww your so cute! you remind me of a cartoon character."" when a dancer gives a compliment on stage it's either she really means it or ""hey i would like some more tips pleeeeassee""

"event","2012 has started quite well, and it's been out of a loom or uncanny. i must be in the area of the sea where i could see a whirlpool emerging from the waters, but if i get all my sails down properly, i can manage to get away for sure.


been waking up in times between 6am(earliest) - 8am (latest). not sure if its genetics, cause most of my family members seem to wake up when the sun wakes up. its nice to have longer days.

Spring Semester has started. Taking prep for chem, anatomy/physio, trig is being difficult (perhaps it's me, i've been lagging on the hw pretty hard. at least it's helping me to get other stuff done), Interpersonal Communications is a WINNING class.

i sold my '95 Camry, to a good friend of mine and got a 300E 89 Benz. i was super stoked on it actually. i washed the rims, beautify it and everything. in between the days, knowing myself i accidentally broke some of the interior parts of the ""peek-a-boo"" roofs while trying to figure out how to open and close it. after a few good weeks (with its daily 10 min warm-ups), the benz started to die on me. it does this thing where it turns itself off at every red light. Luckily i just had to put it on ""P"", and turn it back on. ""turning back on"" can be a ruckus. the sound of the engine trying to go and listening it to fail. PUT ON YOUR FLASHERS, that will get the cars get off your ass, otherwise you'll hear ppl yelling behind ya. Decided to trade in the car and get myself a legit one. 

Oh yeah got laid off. (conveniently how it was right before Semester started). Damn city shut down all the cannabis dispensaries in the area. sucks cause most of the patients needed it for their own medicinal benefits. some say that it helped, and it was better than taking 2+ prescription pills

It's officially been a month that Takkun, my first kitty, has departed his ways from home. I did mention i got him from a pet store, so i assume he loves freedom. Loved the first few months when he was a kitten, but i understand he's and older kitty that is looking for adventure. Knowing him, he's probably got into someones car incidentally, and drove somewhere, and was like ""whhhat, theres a kitty in the car"", and is now in some other city. Dang if only i knew this would've happen, i would NOT neuter him. i would let him flourish and populate with other kitties. no wonder i have this weird feeling. should always go for the weird feelings, im sure its that feeling called ""instinct"" no? 
KIBA aka Shiba (changed it after i realize he was a boy after neutering him back in OCT 2011) is super jawsome. He's getting bigger each day, and more fluffier by the moment. few days ago, he caught a live bird, brought it into my room and started to play with it. i was like ""noo carcasses in the room!"" picked kiba up, got the LIVE bird out of his mouth, setting the bird free. Ever since i'm out of work, i actually don't mind Takkun leavin' cause it's saving me monies on cat food :)

"event","Today i had to go to the dmv to renew my license. To renew it, i had to re-take the basic vision/photo and written test. As i got there, i was amzed how i was 4th person in line, and the wait to get called up wasnt as long at all either. (maybe i was in-tune on familiarizing myself with the dmv driver's handbook text) After taking a horrible id picture (it was early morning, and my hair looked greasy), i realize they had a mirror behind the blue picture ""wall"". While getting my written test, the dmv guy told me ""alright here's 18 questions, and you only have to miss 3 too pass"" i let a big SIGH so big that the dmv notices and said ""wow that's a big SIGH, alright then, good luck!""

My first desk cubicle, the pen did not work whatsoever, so i moved to another one ( luckily the pen works at this one). The questions are totally different that the last time i took the test (5 yrs ago?). there are bizarre questions such as: ""Smoking inside a vehicle when a person younger than 18 yr of age is present is:"" First i told myself ""alright its California, what would California do?"" thought about it, and put a X on the box next to ""iilegal at all times"" The rest of the questions i had to either use common sense, or visualize the standing cubicle is my car.

While waiting for my results, there was this blonde girl, systems were unfortunately down for a bit, and she had to go to work. She gets her results back and sadly she did not passed. She then let her frustrations out by spewing out little rants ""why is there a question about car seats, its not like a have a child anyways; blah blahh, ugh."" People like her makes living or being at the dmv worthwhile.

Moments later the dmv guy called me up and told me ""YOU PASS!""

School... Human Anatomy LAB is beating me up into a pulp! De-skinning the cat and learning the muscles was fun actually. The cadavers were cool. The sight of them didnt scare me since it looks so unreal. The only thing that i would find real about them was the deep smell of formaldehyde. while everyone is learning where the teres major/minor, gracillus, satoris, adductor longus, etc etc, is. I was curious about the cadavers themselves, ""hey gus's arm size looks like mine! and his rectus abdominus seems big! like he was in the army or something, and his leg muscles tissue look all dark and shitty. was he an old veteran with bad legs milo? (hes a super smart azn t.a). I should start get serious with my studies, but for some reason i had a tendency to do something else like play pokemon, Go treasure hunting at shiba's litter box, etc. I have to otherwise, if i fail, it would be just a waste of time.


Shiba is the coolest cat eveer, she stays around the house and chiilllls with me all the time. Even when im not there, i will find her either the patio or chillin in the living room. (yay, finally experiencing the life with a normal kitty). Takkun is too cool for the house, he only comes in for food and leaves."

"event","there's this big guy in my aikido class, hmm let's call him Carl. Carl seems to be one of those big fellows, with a big heart. He would be the guy that would start yelling the Kyaa, or the first guy who would run up and spar. Well upon arriving, most of the students were waiting around, so i walked up to the benches and sat next to Carl.
""Hey, you would fit in that small spot"" Carl said.
""Ha, yeah i guess""
Then we talked about the homework assignment about Anger, if we think it's either good or bad, do we deny it?, etc. etc. 
Funny to say, i had a comfortable conversation with this guy. 

After i put on my gi and everything, i decided to do some lunges.  (Lunges are fuckin sick.)

As i was lunging around the room,  i heard a familiar voice saying, ""Psh, i'm sure that's easy for you to do. I wish my legs could ever do that.""

After the warm-ups, everybody has to choose our sparring partner. Usually i don't really care who i partnered up with. (My previous ones were fun, they all take it seriously. I enjoyed sparring with them.) She chose me. She would be the type that would be your secretary, brunette, white, kind of pretty woman girl. Let's call her Leslie. Leslie feels and seems weak. So I tried to make her toughen up a little, by giving her my jokingly smile, laughs, and being really tough. 
The last technique we learn, i finally got her to pop.
(i guess i grabbed her too hard, maybe thats why she got so mad) 
Fragile Leslie finally grabbed both of my wrists like if she wanted to squeeze some lemons. I was amazed, how hard she grabbed me. Hahaha
Luckily, the technique is a guarantee my hands are free!

when class ended, let's just say the benches occupying the Yoga class, it's teacher came out and told me to be quiet after I said ""Bushes and Spandex""."

drawing gets intense and i suck at sustain gesture; combining line with mass and the overall composition in terms of light and dark? what is that? i guess i'm all lines. [letting you know the media that we are using at the moment is charcoal on newspaper print] i would have taken it later in the day, but at the time i thought it would be fun to start the early mornings (8:30am) with drawing. drawing, is easier when you and the brain aren't connected.

math, this is the third time i've taken stats, (1st withdrew cause i didnt want to do the big project, 2nd i just didn't keep up with the hw and i was distracted in the mornings) students in that class entertains me. there are a variety of students, many nguyens, students and a group of jocky samoans with bitches. The soon to be retired little middle eastern professor in that math class is funny, he has ALOT of patience with the students, even though they mocked back with obvious sarcastic remarks he still taught with a smile.

the other day i went to KICKIN' KRAB (?) (ya know that one place on bristol in between chipotle and chick-fil-a) with a couple of friends mine. Apparently it's an imitation of BOILING CRAB (CAJUN seafood place in bolsa, ya know the type where they serve it by the lb and put bibs on you and it's the only fun like place where you can dismembered the parts of crawfish, shrimp, etc and squeeeze ketchup on the table; A MESSY BARBARIC DINNER, one may say), it's not bad. i like how the menu is just like boiling crab's but instead of ""the whole Sha-bang"" it's ""kickin' style"". The decorations are okay, i love how they use fish nets for the window curtains. It's interesting to see asian workers, makes me feel like I'm at Boiling Crab, and their use of awesome hyphy dance music for their restaurant music. A friend of mine ordered corn with butter, i love how they serve it in a bag swimming in a stick of melted butter. I gave props to a dear friend of mine whom ate the shrimp with the shell/heads on, and marinating his KICKIN style corn into the butter bag and then later ate it as a Dessert. Their skinny fries are okay, i seen better ones and aten better ones."

"event","weds. went to disneyland. tyler knew a higher up guy who works there from working at his dispensary. yates and i got in for free! sandra has her pass. disneyland has its own weather magic there. most likely from those fireworks that blast off into the night sky every day @ 9:30pm. After eating at this one place in tomorrow land yates and i took our tabs and tyler ate his edibles. sandra had work that day so no dice on them shroomies. adventure land. while we were waiting for the indiana jones ride. alot of heavy drops went down. frontier land was mostly desert it was hot/dry like one. the train station at the main st was breeeezy. toon town was hot. splashing water on my face was nice. the whole day that day was 90 degrees in anaheim so yea it was hot.

lines lines lines lines! i like how there's an aproxim wait sign in the beginning of the line. it makes it seem kinda meh. and those fast passes were utterly useless. it was 1pm if you want a fast pass to space mountain have to come between 4-5. the line itself was 20 mins or something. each line has its own experience. this made the wait more enjoyable and entertaining.
Pirates of the Caribbean we were sitting infront of this austrailian family. they sounded polite. ""say hallo to the man over there!"" and the kids were like ""hallo!"" Indiana Jones. i was entertaining myself with the artwork there. Space Mountain i was sitting on the chains and swinging on them. there was nothing else but checking out girls there. it was my first time going on it. while we were going up sandra was like ""there's going to be a half mile drop after we go up!"" and i was like ""NO WAY!!!"" and she lied. it was cool and fast! the lights in the end is the part that did it. the back of my head felt like it was sucking itself in.
Soaring over california. that line is amazing. mistifiers all the way around!!! i was curling up on the line bars. like sitting on them wrapping my legs over 'em it was helping me stretch so it felt nice. (i think i was coming up from this point.) some lady in front of us was trying to sell her soft serve frozen lemonade for 4 bucks cause most of us were all saying ""man that looks soo good right now"" So over at the measurement meter. there was this little white girl that was getting measured. her mother was like ""chin up chin up!"" she was putting her chin up so high standing up so straight. the ""cast member"" was putting her finger above her head and it seems like she was a finger a way from getting in. at the same time yates and i couldn't stop laughing. we were laughing so hard it's crazy. i can't stop myself it's horrible. the little girl couldn't make it, so her and her mom walked out. [this is the point where sandra left to work. she gave me some of her caramel popcorn. it was good and chewy. we bid our farewells to sandra. chill at the cartoon artwork area where there was air condition!!]
Roger Rabbit line was funny. there was a bunch of toddlers with leashes. one with monkeys with without etc. there was this leash kid behind me. he was growling and such (i think the leash got to him.) at times he was kicking me but i was too busy laughing at how ridiculous this is. yates then told me how he would have his kid on one of those and when the kid goes off. yank 'em!
the madahorn or the bob sled ride. the line was interesting. i felt like i was in germany for moment. we were standing in front of this german father and son. then we got separated since it turned to two lines. once we were in the second line i turned around and saw a few little german girls, and the older german sister. they all had blonde and blue eyes it was crazy. the line was playing some dutch music it made me wanna yodel for a second.  the ride was fun.  there was a point where it seemed like we were racing against the other bobsled. apparently the other bobsled contain a bunch of hot chicks. so it was cool. i was upfront by myself. i enjoyed it. i pretended that i was the captain of the bobsled. racing against hot chicks.  did we win? who knows.
haunted mansion was short. storybook ride [thought it was the pinnocchio one] was cool. saw some cool looking plant layouts per story. this is the point where we were getting over it.
went back to california adventure. ate some din din at boudins. had out last ride at the swinging ferris wheel. it was already like 7:30pm. the line to this wasn't as entertaining. just tired and such. the ride was cool and relaxing. we shared a cage with this other three pair. it was a hispanic mom and her two kids. the mom was scared when it was swinging. we were having fun laughing and such. it was cool.

we then left. did a mission on giving jimmy his cellphone back. driving to his house was cool. he lived like down the street from d-land so it was chill. driving my car, creating my own ride. stopping by at the 7-11 getting my one dollar arizonas. appreciating how cheap stuff is outside of d-land. it was getting dark and it was cooling down so this felt nice. the night ended great!

"event","sat and today i temporarily worked at the jamba in lake forest. 738. it was different. like a hamster in it's first cage i was confuse on what i was doing. they had an e-z bar. but no tags. speed of service and communication is key. lake forest itself is a interesting community. once you are in el toro road there is a long strip with nothing but stores and shopping centers. based on the customers and my one experience to the lee sandwiches down the way, people in lake forest are nice. even the fob asians were nice and understandable. the store was definitely chill than the home store i'm at. maybe that's why i had fun at the lake forest store. i just needed something different for a few days. few days of doing the same shit without the stress from the pathetic cheap general manager that doesn't know how to keep his emotions in tact. 

over the courses of days from my last entry. i finished my dui classes at the end of july, and i'm finishing up my hrs at the good will. good will is pretty cool. i've been doing shoes now. finding legit donated shoes, clean them up and have them ready to get priced and bought. i find all these sick shoes too. leather really does keep its condition. it sucks cause whatever goes is only in that size. 


last week. i randomly took a tab of sid and just chilled in my room. from all the noises and the sounds from my house and the coming into realization with my little sisters and the developmental behavior of the little cousins (some in which they blame most of their stupid actions on the brother.. which i told them and their father, the uncle straight up from the insides of my bathroom, telling them that the brother didn't do it, he's not even here. stop being so goddam stupid!).. the loneliness of my mother.. the lack of love that the father gets from my mother... is starting to affect me greatly. i want to move out yes. but i just want to save enough monies now so in the future i won't have to get screwed over. or moving back to the parents house. when i move out it will be a move out. 

school is coming up in a couple of weeks. i just hope i'll meet interesting people in my class. i love the first days. who will be in my class for the semester?

this week will be a busy one. work. volunteer. movie. disneyland. volunteer. work. weekend.

oh yeah i tried growing cannabis plants. one was good but the soil was too much for it. second was doing good it grew the three lil leaves but the cousins fucked it up. the third one. was definitely good. but it was too late to transfer it into the soil. so i gave up."

"event","got one on friday nite. just coming home and bought a burrito super excited to eat it when i get home. apparently i guess i was driving 50mph so they tell me. i passed the balance test and the eye test but putting your foot over your other foot i kinda fail that. once they pull me over i just know. i smell like it i bet. tow the car and back seat of a highway patrol vehicle i go. i was quite upset that i didn't eat that burrito. what a waste.

i didn't have a jacket on so i'm just cold as fuck throughout the night. maybe thats why i fail that foot test. it was just so damn cold. i guess they took my yellow lighter seeing them putting off to the table rather than the possession bag. I did got breathalized and blew 1.1. they took me to like 2 different cells i guess those are waiting cells cause i got finger printed and all that jazz. i had to take off my tom boots cause i'll probably choke somebody with them. then they took me to a cell where i'm going to spend time in. PF8. as i first got in. i saw a bunch of chicks around my age. so its cool i guess. 4 of 'em got caught with theft and the other was an escort. i had fun talking to them n such about drugs and exchange stories on how we got caught. an hr later the 4 chicks got released and i'm stuck with the escort plus some new old lady that got in for drug possessions. later 2 chicks got in for dui and from then on we just had a nice 8 hr bonding time.

the cell was super uncomfortable. everything is made out of concrete. it was super cold and the patrol chicks there are super mean and nasty. i didn't really care for them being nasty but to the fact that there was a/c and it was super cold that just piss me off. the cell has a toilet, it was pretty nasty cause some ppl use it as a trash can. there was a sink/ drinking fountain but the water wasn't filtered at all and it looked white.  food was horrible they gave the first group i was with a  bunch of brown bags filled with bread nasty balogne and nasty carrots. i made one cause i was super hungry. there was no clock so we had to get the time based on the lighting and the inmates that came in asking what time they get caught at. time was pretty valuable and our savior. 

it was nice during the waiting period. i got to kinda know them and such. the escort, she was in there since 8p and she supposed to be there for a couple of hrs but she finally got released after 10 hrs. 30 mins before she got released i guess. i finally had a conversation with her since she's been quiet and she only wore a skirt and shirt so i guess she was concentrating on keeping herself warm. she told me her name was salene but i told her if that was her real name she said it was her escort name so i asked whats her real name was. her name is kaleb.  i asked her if her ""friends"" were nice to her and the guy shes working for treated her well. she said  yea and that they took her and her friend shopping all the time to get new clothes and do what everybody else does to have fun. i was relieved. i just hate it when some ""escorts"" get treated horribly and all that jazz.

later we gave each other nicknames. i guess our minds weren't that creative so it's based on the streets we got caught at. later mine was later changed to ""crouching tiger"" cause i was always in a crouching position with my arms wrapped around my legs and my legs  crouch against my chest. thats the only way to get warmth. you can't wear anybody else's jacket. cause when i first came in to the cell one of the 4 thieves did that and she got bitched at. 

one of the dui's Mc Arthur, she's the first african american woman with ocd i ever met. i forget what her name was but her story was that somebody was stalking her car, she changed her lane so she can let the car go by, but it still stayed right behind her. when she exited her home st, mc arthur, they pull the sirens on her. they told her that somebody called her in saying she was driving 100 mph. she said she was going the speed limit. and she saw an audi going way fast on the freeway. told them about it. and the highway patrol denied and said they saw nothing. 

Other dui. was valarie or Bolsa chica. she was 19. and was coming home from a party in long beach. she was  going on the on ramp to the freeway @ 75 mph. she naively said that ""she was going with the flow of traffic and wants to go home""  she luckily breathalize at .08  took her in. she is a minor and had alcohol in her system.  before she went into the cell, they took her jewelery, heels and her tights. luckily she had her jacket on considering she was wearing a dress. she seemed very cold. they didn't give her slippers. and when we saw the inmates with them. she'll always say ""they have slippers! why can't i have pair"". i'm glad she's pretty entertaining otherwise being in the there would be such a bore. she reminded me of someone name karina.

our room is smack dab down the hall so there is a clear viewing on the patrol girls. they were all sitting in a circle with comfy chairs one of them was spinning around. all they do is sit and when they do something its either them feeding other inmates, get another group of inmates into cells n such. all i hear is bitch noises and screaming commands. its stupid. when they give all the inmates [but us] food and the other patrol chicks but one left i knew it was lunch time and the sudden time of freedom is comin up. 3 more hrs i guessed. the other chicks that were with me were ready to leave.

 time passes by our minds grew dreary and we finally got released around 1pm. i was so happy. everybody was happy. we  got our things from the place, and monies from the cashier. and out into the nice warm sun. my skin was grateful for this warmth and i was so happy. i was kicking around pinecombs cause my legs and my body were sick from sitting so long.

a good friend or sister picked me up and i went straight home, take off my contacts and go to to the towing place to get my car out. apparently they are close sats and sun so i was pissed. i went to work. super restless but i bought a nice fat burrito [after 40 mins i clocked in i got a half] and that got me going for awhile. i went home around 11. took a nice shower went online for a bit. i just layed on my bed close my eyes just a second and i fell asleeep. it was a goood sleep considering i havent slept at allll since i woke up on friday morning.

They gave me a pink slip saying it's my temporary license for 30 days. my court date is 4-19 day before 4-20. hopefully i can ask the judge if i can do community serivce and pay half the normal fine. i am license less. the ""state"" has my license and i don't know when i'm getting it back. hopefully after court they'll give it back. i use my license as an id. so i have no id for now.

it was quite an experience. so now ima check it off my list on things that i experienced."

"event","yesturday i went to the optometrist to get new specs and contacts. it literally took me an hr to put them on, and half an hr to take ONE of them out. i think i wasted at least half of their bottle of solution. (since i kept on dropping it so much)

when i got home from work though... i was pretty out of it so it tripped me out to take the contacts off. It literally felt like i was gouging my eyes out. Sometimes i worry that the contacts would go behind my eye and that i had to go to surgery n such. eew surgery i hate it. doctors are stupid.

contacts day 2
it took me 40 mins to put them on. i was happy cause it's 20 mins less than before. one of our loyal customers though taught me how to properly to put it on and take it out. she's cool though, she gave me these eye drops just in case if my eyes get dry. the thing is though, i don't think my eyes get dry, they feel tired.  especially after like 9 hrs of wearing them. When i got home though it took me a total of 5 mins to take them out. i was soo happy :)

Hopefully later in the week i can be pro-status. well not really pro-status to the point where i can put two contacts at once, but to the point where i can put them on at least a min.

the key thing is, lower your head and look straight at the mirror."

"event","i picked up half an eighth of shrooms. i only took a big cap and a fat stem since i wanted to trip out just slightly. tyler and jeff took half an 8th each and we all gulped it down with synergy drinks called ""triology"" since it was just the three of us and its the flavor that tasted really good. tyler and i bought our drinks, but jeff didn't. So i was like ""lets test out good karma."" we all went over to the performing arts area, and just chilled there for a couple of hrs by the pyramid. We watched when day became night. when each minute pass i began to see more and more stars . With the tall buildings, and the blank white walls, it felt like we were in the area, which takes us away  from whats beyond it. This felt nice. For a moment, nothing really mattered to me, people, family, work. nothing. i just then sat back against the pyramid and just enjoy the night. there were other people though, but these people were making awesome shadow plays against the blank walls. It tripped us all of us out. I called this entertainment. then an hr and half later we finally got up and started to wander around the area. 

I wanted to pee, so we tried tgi fridays, but theres too many people in there so we walked around the area some more. We were amazed by the new theater. The glass was so thick, and the buildings were just pretty. Then we went to south coast. i was taking a lot of interest on alot of pretty girls. i felt i was starving. Starving for love and intimacy. I went to the bathroom, i looked to the side of the stalls, and the patterns were slowly moving. Then, we walked around. We went to borders, since tyler had to pee. I began to listen to some jazz music. I forgot what the band was, but it was really good. Tyler took interest and took over my headphones. I told him i'll be downstairs since i wanted to check out the books. I did, but i couldn't look at them. There was so many words, and the cover of the books was just too much, I couldn't look at literature in the eye!!!! we walked out, and went to metro. 

Metro pointe, my 2nd home. The place where i work countless hrs of my life. Its like spending most of your life at school. Metro pointe does the same to me. We went over to barnes and i was taking interest in art. I never really looked at art when i'm on psychedelics. Tyler and i started to look at art.i was looking at the works of Gustav Klimt. It was something random that i picked out, and his art just amazed me. thats all i can say. Jeff came back upstairs, and starting to have a bad trip. Tyler said maybe the sight of the girl he wants to be with, is with her mom downstairs probably triggered it. I guess tyler was trying to tell us to leave but i just kept on looking at more art. So, finally i saw jeff sitting down just tripping, and i said ""Yea, lets just leave."" So..we walked towards and around  the wimbeldon neighborhoods.  Tyler was trying to tell jeff, that its okay, your just tripping out on shrooms. Jeff almost threw up, and he felt sick. Tyler tried to make him feel better by going on saying the same shit he was saying to jeff, since jeff didn't get it. I told tyler ""hey, maybe instead of walking around so much, and since jeff kept on asking if he has a home or not, Why can't we just go to a place that is homelike like at your house or something.""  We went through wakeham park. and hopped over a bunch of sprinklers that were on the way. it was a mission. Tyler had to make a call. So it was just jeff and i. I told jeff, ""its okay, just sit, relax and just enjoy what's going on now. Have fun! and enjoy this night with us."" He kinda felt relaxed for a bit. To be honest. What i felt that night, i didn't think much of anything. Sure i thought about a girl, but i told myself ""whats the fucking point on thinking about a girl that's not interested on me whatsoever. I have nothing to worry about. I'm single and i could just feed on life as much as i want. All i have is a job. I have a few friends. All i can do is just live. Live my life, without any worries."" This is what i thought all night. Nothing else. All the girls i liked never liked me back. I guess, i wasn't made for love. So i just got over it, and if something comes up like a girl that was interested in me then yes, i will be like ""hooray someone does love me!"" For now, i just want to live.

We went back to my car, and went to tylers house. Angel met up with us. And we just smoked. Jeff was then freaking angel and i out. Tyler pretty much took care of him, kept on asking him if he wants to go outside, and he could chill with him outside and such. Then we waited for a bit, and went inside. I was uploading angel some cds with my lab top, and jeff seems to be comfortable on tylers bed. ha i was right. 

Then, i went home,  took a hot shower. The shower was nice, i enjoyed it. I felt clean! Then i fell asleep. Went to work the next day, again i didnt think of anything and just concentrate on work. Left and here i am. Nhung and Kristen walked by, hahaha i guess my labtop is pretty macish,"

= Buy necessary x-mas or b-day presents....
= then once i get my license from the mail [which will take a few weeks or so]...hopefully father will buy me a used car..kuz that was supposed to be my graduation present.... 
= With my license i can open up a checking account at washington mututal....kuz washington mutual has less fees to deal with...so take that bank of america and wells fargo....
= Buy new awesome clothes!!!

well since i work like 5 days a week..or 30 hrs a week...i have about a couple of days a week or whatever free time i have after work..to do all these before the year ends....might be kinda possible...well the getting the license in the mail might take awhile....so this will take about half way from janurary....

after watching a few episode of gundam wing [the most awesomest anime in 8th grade]...i began to realize that a person i know named Christine Lethaby always thought of me like the character Duo from gundam wing...since Duo's always outgoing with a happy-go-lucky attitude and also Tidus from Final Fantasy X..since he has similar characteristics but he loves to eat food....

now i realize that im pretty much the opposite of what i used to be....shit...i should just accept life and be whatevers....instead of being in thought most of the time...kuz i realize..whenever im in thought...its always about painful memories..i guess im depressing now...and usually i dont show my painful emotions...therefore i concentrate it in my head....and this somewhat damages it....and thats why i have a short term memory loss...and i suck at remembering names or whos on what..and my verbal skills sucks like a biznatch kuz i dont make sense whatsoever...and yea...thats why i tried drinking some tea...or anything that will balance my mind and even myself...times like these..i need to go see a therapist....

oo yea..i saw the movie Monster today at jimmys...and man...that was one intense movie...i realize the fugly prositute was charlize theron....man..what a transformation....overall it was great..and i cried..

gonna go job huntin this week...but for some reason...part of me wants to wait until im 18 after i got my record seal so its easier to get hired since most jobs might do backgroudn checks...but part of me wants to find a job right now...and start learning how to spend money wisely...."

most ppl i know are starting their first years in college in fall..pretty much in a few weeks from now..i guess jimmy and i are the only ones starting in spring.....for me...its best to find a major that im looking for instead of wasting loads of money on going nowheres like my aunt and my cuzens....the bad part is..i dont really think about the future..i just go with the flow in life....so its harder for me to figure out what the hell am i gonna be when i grow up....but i have a set plan until the starting of the spring semester....for sure i have to find a steady job that i wont get fired in less than 9 working days....and once i find a steady job its easier for me to figure out the schedule for the future classes....and i could save up my working cash and pay for my own books and junk...kuz i dont wanna be a troublesome towards me parents....so yea..for those whose going to occ...i'll see you guys hopefully in the spring.....sheeeshaaaawwww....."

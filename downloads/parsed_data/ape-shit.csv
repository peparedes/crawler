"event","Alot has happened sence the last time I typed. the reason for a long return is my Gram got a bill for the internet. no one would fese up so everybody got baned. then abouy the middle of june my gram fell and broke her hip. of couse she would because she waghied over 240lbs. I had to watched the house after that. I still had my job and all. plus I had to play taxi with everybody who did'nt have a car.my sister i didn't mind but the people i hated kept asking me. finally I was made an offer to move. I took it. and now I'm starting a new life. now i live near two malls, many fast food places, and still have a bit of country. plus i have a cold."

time passes.

the pain never 
sirpasses.

these eyes of mine.

everyday i look at
your picture,i wonder
who you really were.

this small guide
as my mental

looking for the pieces 
of us.
and how we ever
conectted

mother and daughter
stranger to stranger
we stand
in ths field
of judgement.

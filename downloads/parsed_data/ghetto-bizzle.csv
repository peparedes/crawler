"event","Yeah...uhhhh...so i really need a job! lol, this shit is gettin ridiculous.  Driving to maryland every couple days just to make a lil bit of cash can't happen much longer.  Had a second interview with Enterprise on tuesday and observed for a couple hours.  Supposed to hear from them Monday...don't really think i got it for some reason, which means the job search continues =/
I shoulda majored in like Education cuz you're like guaranteed a job after that lol....but whatever.  I'll just keep lookin...

Runnin back and forth between maryland and NY has made me realize how much i miss my family and friends here.  But life goes on and i have to keep moving forward, not backwards.  I just wished they all lived closer and i saw them more.  Mad props to my old friends from home who have known me for practically my whole life and have stuck by me...you don't know what that means to me.  My best friend Delanna...damn, we've been down for 15 years!!! if you can believe that...how crazy.  No one is more real than that girl and I love her for that!  I know she would never do me dirty, no matter what, she would die first.  And she knows it's the same for me.  I've had my fill of fake ppl and i'm sooo done.  Def not puttin out any effort to make new friends, i'm perfectly content with the ones that i got.  I might not have many but the few that I do have are enough and they're AMAZING...you know who you are, I don't need to say.everyone just know this...no longer will i be the one puttin all the effort into keepin and maintainin' a friendship, so if u want to remain friends, keep up the effort or count me out!  



couldn't do any of it without my family, friends, and my one and only Yves(love you baby)"

"event","So today I was lookin in the Staten Island Advance classifieds tryin to find any job basically lol.  I called a few and spoke to some people and turns out now i have an interview tomrrow at 230.  The thing that sux is that i'm in Maryland right now and have to work tomorrow from 7-10am which doesn't give me much time to spare gettin there.  I had to buy an outfit for the interview cuz i have none of my dress clothes here at home.  It turned into a huge ordeal and if i don't get this job, i'm gonna be pissed.  But i'm tryin to think positive here...lol, what you couldn't tell? haha  I am worried tho that my vacation to Jamaica in 2 weeks will be a problem in gettin the job...hopefully that's not the case.

Went w/my BFF Delanna to get pics taken today.  They are sooo cute and i cant wait to get them back.  I've been soooo exhausted lately and i don't know why.  It's not like i'm doin anything outta the ordinary.  I've been like gettin sleepy around like 10 but forcing myself to stay up later..don't know why.

Jamaica in 2 weeks...holy shit i can't wait.  Time's def flyin by tho, I can't believe it's so close.  Def haven't gotten to bathing suit status yet so there could be some problems =( Regardless tho, i know it's gonna be beautiful and that we're gonna have an amazing time.  It's another vacation with just me and the boys.  Me and Yves are goin with Steve Schwartz and Matt Pascarelli...it's gonna be good times.
 
wish me luck ppl at my interview...i soooooooooo need a job"

SOooooo last night which was supposed to be a bunch of us girls goin out to the Culture Club ended up being just me and jac.  Kinda bummed that no one else was able to come but we def made the best of it.  We had soooo much fuckin fun, it's like we were the only ones everywhere we went.  We didn't care what ppl were thinking about us or what they were saying.  By the way...Culture Club is the best time ever!!! If you love the 80's i def recommend it.  But we were def the youngest ppl there...but that's ok.  It was a crazy crazy night and i'll never forget it as long as i live.  I can't even begin to explain or describe how awesome it was.  There's nothin like gettin home at 5 am and goin to bed when the birds have already started chirppin...that's when you know it was a good night ;) Lookin forward to the next visit and hopin my girl Caitlin can come, cuz i know she would love it too.

"event","Found a dress for tuesday's booze cruise FINALLY and one also for graduation...thanks to jackie moran who tolerated my insanity on a two day hunt. lol.  I'm finally startin to get things done...lots of stuff to do today.  For some reason i've decided to apply for grad school at Wagner for the fall...i know i know....some of u are thinking...SHE'S SOOO FULL OF SHIT lol.  Yeah i'm sure i'm gonna regret it as soon as it happens (if it does).  I was gonna wait til yves and i moved to philly to go to grad school and get my Master's of Social Work, but we're gonna be on the island for at least 2 more years.  I think i would feel like i was wasting my time if i didn't take advantage of the connections i have here and the fact that if i got a GA job school would be free.  So this is my new plan which i'm tryin to put in motion today...I want to work with little kids and almost everywhere they want you to be certified for teaching so....i think i'm gonna do Early Childhood Education Birth-2nd grade.

Attempting to pack up the rest of my room and move it all into the apartment.  I'm soooo stoked you have NOOOOOO idea.  I love the idea of living in an apartment...it's like everything that i used to dream about when i lived in Hagerstown is all starting to come true.  I was determined attend and graduate from college and on May 20th, that dream will be a reality.  I found the love of my life in Yves.  He's really the best thing that could have ever happened to me and i'm so grateful that my path led to him.  I also am moving into an apartment...something a lot of ppl my age (including lots of my friends) cannot say.  No moving back home for me after college!  The important things are really starting to come together...so all the hard work and stress has been worth it.

The friends and fam are comin up thursday night for graduation!  Cannot tell you how excited i am about that!  There is nothing like old friends and nothing better than your oldest friends meeting your newest and im totally looking forward to showing everybody off! =)"

And i'm amazed at how self-involved and unconcerned you are...guess i've just been fooling myself all this time to think that you really cared.  I don't know how you can't see how you've hurt me so many times...but maybe u do know and you just don't care.  After all the things i've done, i was there for you when everyone else turned their back on you, you treated me like shit and i took it cuz i love you...i don't expect much in return, just friendship and to know that you appreciate me and that to know that you care...it's not that hard, all i ask is a minimal effort and i can't even get that.  I can't keep doin this to myself, i thought i was strong enough, well i was and i am, but what's the point with NOTHING in return?  And it's partly my fault for standing up for myself only to backdown to the same excuses time after time.  And what perfect timing...college graduation...And as time goes by,  more lies surface.  But I won't say that i wasted my time, cuz that's not how i see it...and i can't say that i don't care cuz i wouldn't be so upset if didn't...it just seems that i made it more than it actually was.  I just don't understand what has happened and what is happening...so have your false friends, that's fine...just know that i killed myself tryin to be a good friend to you and i love you so much, but i can't do it anymore...and i won't let you turn it around on me this time and try and make me feel guilty bc i've done everything in my power...i can't make a friendship work by myself.

Friday we just chilled and bullshit'd cuz i was on duty the whole night but saturday it was on!  Yves showed up surprising us with breakfast and Fun Passes for the subway eventhough he couldn't go with us.  HOW AMAZING IS HE?!?! Then me,ben and tim went into the city.  We went to South Street Seaport, Times Square, Canal Street, and Ground Zero.  We def had a lot of fun...saw a drunken, passed out man lyin on the edge of the subway platform and watched an MTA worker take his gallon of vodka and kick him around a lil...def think we snapped a pic also.  Out of Control! lol...

When we got back to SI it was on...ordered $5 pizza pies...took waaaay too many shots of vodka and whiskey for the old man ben...got heavily intoxicated...continued pregame status in erin's room...made some inappropriate comments (what can ya do? lol)...def don't remember anything about actually attending songfest performances but know that i was there, i have pics to prove it...lol like a thousand.  Loved hangin out with my girls saturday...Jackie M., Angela, Kristen, Erin, Nicole, Maureen...and if i didn't mention ur name i apologize cuz that means i just don't remember...lol my bad! Def slapped ben a few times when we lost tim...lol sorry bout that, and i def took a tumble on my way to towers to pick up t-shirts for the girls...got the bruises and scrapes to prove it...and to whoever the boy was who helped me up...THANKS lol.  Let's not even discuss the bar situation...lol although that's one part of the night i remember the most lol

Loved all the random pics and stayin up til 6 am chillin w/ Ang, Jackie and Ben...such a good time, and no hangover which was the best part.  So if i was obnoxious, i apologize...(a lil) but i had an amazing time...so glad someone from home finally came to visit...love it when that happens...THANKS EVERYONE WHO MADE MY SONGFEST AMAZING...oh and ps...im a fuckin SOLDIER!! =)"

The let down this weekend was not all bad...it actually led to quality time with Yves.  We went to dinner on the island and just talked about stuff.  We really wanted to do something though cuz we didn't want to waste a perfectly good saturday night.  I don't know how i thought about it but i mentioned how i used to always go to the arcade with friends at home when we were really bored.  So we went to this ghetto ass arcade, mostly for lil kids, and played air hockey and video games for awhile.  We had a lot of fun...

So the trips home every weekend are gonna continue for the enitre month of april unfortunately.  I initially made 3 doc appts this month bc i'll be goin off my mom's insurance once i graduate in may so i figured i should get them in now.  Well those appts led to other appts.  Apparently there is something goin on with my heart...don't know what it is exactly.  So i have to get an EKG tomorrow morning...fun stuff.  The doc also made me get some blood tests done to see if they can find out what's wrong, hopefully it's nothing serious.  So not only do i have this EKG tomorrow at 8 am, i have to drive all the way back to NY right after cuz i have work and 2 fuckin papers to write this week.  CAN'T WAIT TIL THIS FUCKIN WEEK IS OVER!! My special visitor is coming this weekend...yay VERY EXCITED! This visit will be the perfect end to a fucked up week.

Thanks to my baby for tryin to keep me sane thru all the stress tho...love ya.
Being in a good mood is rare for me these days but hopefully that won't last long past graduation.  But what def made my day soooo much better was a comment made to me by Shkendie.  I saw her in the office today and she was like ""Des i was thinkin about you last night after we talked and i was thinkin about how much i've gotten to know you this past year and that i really like you and then i realize you're leaving this year and how it sucked.""

Well the little things mean a lot...thanks Shkendie. i think ur awesome!
Good news on the horrible History of Film class scenario.  I had planned on goin to NYU tomorrow to watch this film for my research paper bc it's like impossible to buy or find.  But then this morning (while writting the shitty paper) i got a call from the library on campus tellin me they had the movie i was lookin for and that i could pick it up whenever.

Well...time to get back to work unfortunately...or maybe i'll try to sleep...hopefully the caffeine won't keep me awake all night long."

"event","Yesterday it was my bestest Kim's birthday.  She couldn't make it to school yesterday and it was my mission to see her on her birthday.  So me, christen, and melissa decided that we would take a road trip to her house and surprise her.  It really made my day just to get to see her and give her her gifts, even if we didn't stay that long.  
After we left Kim's house, we went to Melissa's to eat a nice homecooked meal.  It was soooo good!! Her family is amazing...soooo jealous btw (by the way). haha  Who knew just eating dinner with a family could be so much fun.  They were great.  The three of us definitely spent the time before dinner going down memory lane in melissa's room.  Flipping thru embarrassing and hysterical pics from freshmen year...all in all...it was good times.

P.S. Heard a rumor about my number 1 subscriber...and if she would CALL ME BACK...i could find out if it was true!"

"event","Ok ok...SUOOC status goin on.  Very interesting and yet a lil scary at the same time...be careful, not looking good.
Anyway...So the night of ""drinking like ladies"" went well I must say! It was a very turbulent evening in which i was rather unprepared for.  But I got through it and I'll never work another monday night duty EVER AGAIN!!! Especially when there's no school the next day.  Today is my bestest's birthday...HAPPY 20th BIRTHDAY KIM! One more year girl...just one more. =)  I hope that i get to see you soon.
Sooo...brace yourselves cuz you're gonna be jealous. haha.  I have tickets to the First Ladies concert on saturday.  It's gonna be Beyonce, Alicia Keys and Missy Elliot...soooo excited.  Me, Yves, Caitlin and one of her friends will be attending.  By the way,this is Yves first concert EVER...courtesy of his lovely girlfriend (haha).  So i really can't wait for saturday.  
As you can prolly tell by my opening line...there's a new secretive lingo in the works created by Tuffy, cmaddy, and myself.  You prolly shouldn't waste your time trying to decipher it cuz you'll prolly be wrong.  Sorry...we're very selective about who we disclose this new language too.  Ok, now that everyone who reads this thinks that we're bananas...i'll holler at u kids later."

"event","So this whole thing about losing an hour has royally f'd up my sleep schedule.  I'm mad tired right now and not to mention the fact that I'm at the Ed Dept and we all know that I hate every minute of it.  Definitely gotta get TONS of stuff accomplished today.  Clean my room, do my laundry, get my bestest her bday gift! =) Me and Meliss are doin that as soon as she gets outta class today. YAY!! Dinner last night at Yves parent's house was really good...we made Bri eat shrimp...YOU KNOW U LOVE IT!!!! (HAHA) But we definitely forgot that she doesn't like to eat shrimp, but oh well...she did anyway.  See Bri, you're partaking in the fun. (haha) 
I'm on duty tonight and Thursday night...this should be soooooo much fun.  Especially tonight (wink, wink) My kimmy's birthday is coming up....SUPER excited about that.  Don't worry girl, we're gonna bring the party to you! Whether u like it or not...jk. 

P.S.--Jess, since i'm updating my live journal for you...i expect u to read it dammit!!!! (haha)"

"event","So last night jess and i went to our first Staten Island based party (haha).  I was kinda worried at first about how it would go down, but we ended up having a lot of fun even if it did end mad early.  But what can you expect, it was thrown by a bunch of freshmen. (lol jk)  It was good times with good people.  And yes jess, we were THOSE girls...and I don't care. lol And apparently i was more drunk than i thought i was cuz last night when i went to bed and tried to go to sleep, the room started spinning.  I haven't felt that way in a long time, but i guess good vodka will do that to you.
Today Yves, Bri, and I are goin to Jersey for dinner at Yves parents' house.  This will be Bri's first time experiencing Yves cooking, and we'll see how well she can understand what his family is saying...lol.  This should be good, i can't wait.  I'm really loving these good days i've been having, i hope they keep coming, i could get used to it.

P.S. Missin my Kim and always thinkin of you.

P.S.S. Oh and we can't forget Melissa's drunken phone call to my cell just to tell me she heard ""Antonio's Anthem""  Love it!"

"event","Well for the past two days i've been in a really great mood.  (yes me, in a great mood...but don't be worried)  I think this past week off from school is really what i needed.  I feel refreshed and shit...lol.  Hopefully it will last through the week, well maybe i shouldn't get greedy, I'll settle for the rest of the day.  
  Thanks to my girl Bri, my sunshine bizzle, I got coverage for thursday night.  We're gonna get wasted and go see all our friends dressed up like lunatics.  Then we're gonna get wasted some more and go to the fashion show after party.  Where ever that may be.  (Let's hope it's not Dock Street) Anyway, me and my girls are gonna drop it like it's hott for as long as we're still standing. It's gonna be good, I can feel it.
  
  P.S.  this great mood has been brought to you by Yves Kabore without which it could not be possible.  (Love you)"

"event","So for me, Spring Break meant going home to Maryland and working at the Waffle House.  Trust me, it was defintely not my idea of a good time. Nor was it anywhere near relaxing.  But I did have fun hangin out with my old friends.  There was a serious shopping trip to columbia mall with Greg which was amazing.  Then there was the dinner and bars with delanna and fallon, very good times.  My baby came to visit me friday through sunday and we saw ""Dawn of the Dead"", very weird movie. 
  Now it's back to school and more work.  Serious paper to finsih and trying to plan for the future with my schedule for next fall and my internship and all that fun stuff =\  Hopefully  I'll be spared of any nervous breakdowns between now and the end of this semester...which is surprisingly close i've just realized.  But this is me we're talkin about sooo...i'm sure the time will come.  Definitely missed my bizzles while i was gone..and i can't wait to catch up with them.  HOLLER KIDS!!!"

"event","I'm finally getting my life back together.  Yesterday was my first day back to classes since ""the incident"" and I was really nervous and stressing myself out about it.  I was worried how my professors would handle my absences and make-up work and stuff, but as usual, i was stressing myself out for no reason.  I do still have to make up two mid-terms...which def sucks.  I have a feeling me and my social work professor are gonna have words today though.

  Anyway, a few more days and it will all be over...for a week anyway.  But i'm not doing anything exciting for spring break like most people, i'm goin home to work at the Waffle House. (fun stuff, trust me)  Spring break should be relaxing and stress-free...not when ur goin home to MY house and back to work.  So basically i'm leaving one stressful environment and entering another one...this should be great!  Aight well...that's all for now, tired of typing...peace kids"

"event","...for now anyway.  I finally finished my social work paper that was due LAST wednesday but who the hell cares, it's done and i feel better.  Now i just have to wait for the next installment of stress which i'm sure will come before i'm ready as it usually does.  

So ricki lake was sooooo much fun.  The topic kinda sucked, she did her infamous topic....""Weave Wars.""  It was BANANAS!!  The camera guy fell in love with Christen and since i was sitting right beside her, we will more than likely have significant air time when the show is on tv. hahaha.  Jess, Christen and I were drooling over Max and Omar...the best part of the entire show. (they were the bare chested men just standing on the sidelines opening doors for the guests, but they were grrrrrrrreat)  

So now that i've gotten my paper done, my next mission is to clean my room.  It's been officially declared a NATIONAL DISASTER AREA! just ask ralph...he saw it on accident.  Anyway, we got another bizzle birthday on the horizon...yup yup it's O.G. bizzle's birthday tomorrow, the big 20.  I know he's gonna be pissed cuz i'm announcing for all to see but who cares, he loves the attention even if he denies it.  The bizzle squad unites tomorrow night for the event...and we're gettin WASTED IN YO FACE kids!!!!!!!!! HOLLA"

"event","Ok so the gym thing has actually been happening, I pretty much go for about 1-2 hours everyday...(that i have time) which last week was 5.  But right now i'm seriously stressed out because i have a paper that's due by 3 pm today and I haven't even started yet.  So i had to find someone to cover my hours in the RA office (thanks christy and christen) so i could go to the library and do it before class.  Not to mention that I have work from 10am to 1pm...but i'm getting outta here early too.  Silly me thinking that i could maybe do my paper in the Ed Dept because i usually do absolutely NOTHING and today of all days they have me running around doing everthing u could imagine.  So i gotta stop waisting more time and get my ass to the library so i can bang out this paper really quick.  I gotta get my ass in gear kids, wish me luck....HOLLER!

p.s. DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE TO GET DRUNK TONIGHT

"event","Ok so I'm about to reach heffer status and it's time to get serious!  I've decided that I'm gonna work out as often as I can with every spare moment that I have.  Ugghhhhh...it's so frustrating!  But I need SERIOUS motivation from all my friends and especially my bizzles.  Melissa, when you're doin Tae Bo...call my ass!  Christen, when you're doin 10 minute abs...call my ass!  I think you guys get the picture now. 
  So I got that off of my chest and I feel a lot better, now I just gotta do it.  School officially sucks but what can ya do.  I got one more year left and then I'M OUT!!!!  You know it's serious when you get a letter in your mailbox talkin about what you want your diploma to say.  I must say I was a lil excited about that.  Yeah I know, I'm a loser, feel bad for me.  jk
  Well, it is Wednesday and if you're a bizzle you know why I'm excited by this.  That's right, it's the NEW official bizzle night.  So it's time to get bent and forget about everything that's botherin me.  CAN'T WAIT!!!  Aight well i'm out kids....holler @ me!"
